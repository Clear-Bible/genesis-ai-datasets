SYSTEM OF TRANSLITERATION

   The following system of transliteration has been used for Hebrew:

   ' = ' or omitted at the z = z       =

   beginning of a word.
                           ch = ?      p = p
   b = b                   t = ?       ph = ph or p
   v = bh or b             y = y       ts = ?
   g = g                   k = k       q = ?
   g = gh or g             k = kh or k r = r
   d = d                   l = l       s = s
   d = dh or d             m = m       s = sh
   h = h                   n = n       t = t
   v = w                   s = s       t = th or t

   The vowels are transcribed by a, e, i, o, u, without attempt to
   indicate quantity or quality. Arabic and other Semitic languages are
   transliterated according to the same system as Hebrew. Greek is written
   with Roman characters, the common equivalents being used.

KEY TO PRONUNCIATION

   When the pronunciation is self-evident the titles are not respelled;
   when by mere division and accentuation it can be shown sufficiently
   clearly the titles have been divided into syllables, and the accented
   syllables indicated.

   ?? as in  sofa  o? ? as in  not   iu? ?? as in?  duration
   ?? ?"?"? arm    O?   "? "? nor    c = k?   "? "? cat
   a ?"?"? at      u ??"?"? full [1] ch? ? ?"?"?  church
   a ?"?"? fare    u ??"?"? rule     cw  =? qu as in queen

   O ?"?"? no      iu ??"?"? few     j ????"?"? jaw
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] In German and French names ü approximates the sound of u in dune.

   [2] In accented syllables only; in unaccented syllables it approximates
   the sound of e in over. The letter n, with a dot beneath it, indicates
   the sound of n as in ink. Nasal n (as in French words) is rendered n.

ENCYCLOPEDIA OF RELIGIOUS KNOWLEDGE

   Basilica
          BASILICA: 1. Legal codes. Since the great codification of the
          Roman law by Justinian, the Corpus juris civilis, was written in
          Latin, it could not meet the needs of the East, and required
          Greek translations. To do away with the uncertainty which had
          arisen from such versions, in 878 the emperor Basil the
          Macedonian had a handbook put together, covering forty titles,
          and put out a revision in 885. A further revision and
          codification of the older laws, edited once more under Leo the
          Wise (886), bears the Greek name of ta basilika. It is in sixty
          books, based on Justinian's compilation from the older versions
          and commentaries, with extracts from his later constitutions
          known as the Novellæ, and from Basil's handbook mentioned above.

   Basilides and the Basilidians

  BASILIDES, bas-i-l?i´dîz, AND THE BASILIDIANS.

    Basilides.

          Basilides, a famous Gnostic, was a pupil of an alleged
          interpreter of St. Peter, Glaucias by name, and taught at
          Alexandria during the reign of Hadrian (117-138). He may have
          been previously a disciple of Menander at Antioch, together with
          Saturnilus. The Acta Archelai state that for a time he taught
          among the Persians. He composed twenty-four books on the Gospel,
          which, according to Clement of Alexandria (Stromata, iv, 12),
          were entitled "Exegetics." Fragments of xiii and xxiii,
          preserved by Clement and in the Acta Archelai, supplement the
          knowledge of Basilides furnished by his opponents. Origen is
          certainly wrong in ascribing to him a Gospel. The oldest
          refutation of the teachings of Basilides, by Agrippa Castor, is
          lost, and we are dependent upon the later accounts of Irenæus,
          Clement of Alexandria, and Hippolytus. The latter, in his
          Philosophumena, gives a presentation entirely different from the
          other sources. It either rests on corrupt accounts, or, more
          probably, on those of a later, post-Basilidian phase of the
          system. Hippolytus describes a monistic system, in which
          Hellenic, or rather Stoic, conceptions stand in the foreground,
          whereas the genuine Basilides is an Oriental through and
          through, who stands in closer relationship to Zoroaster than to
          Aristotle.

    His System.

          The fundamental theme of the Basilidian speculation is the
          question concerning the origin of evil and how to overcome it.
          The answer is given entirely in the forms of Oriental gnosis,
          evidently influenced by Parseeism. There are two principles,
          untreated and self-existent, light and darkness, originally
          separated and without knowledge of each other. At the head of
          the "kingdom of light" stands "the uncreated, unnamable God."
          From him divine life unfolds in successive steps. Seven such
          revelations form the first ogdoad, from which issued the rest of
          the spirit-world, till three hundred and sixty-five
          spirit-realms had originated. These are comprised under the
          mystic name Abrasax, whose numerical value answers to the number
          of the heavens and days. Being seized with a longing for light,
          darkness now interferes. A struggle of the principles commences,
          in which originated our system of the world as copy of the last
          stage of the spirit-world, having an archon and angel at its
          head. The earthly life is only a moment of the general
          purification-process which now takes place to deliver the world
          of light from darkness. Hence everything which is bad and evil
          in this system of the world becomes intelligible when regarded
          in its proper relations. Gradually the rays of light find their
          way through the mineral kingdom, vegetable kingdom, and animal
          kingdom. Man has two souls in his breast, of which the rational
          soul tries to master the material or animal. For the
          consummation of the process an intervention from above is
          necessary, however. The Christian idea of the manifestation of
          God in Jesus Christ is the historical fact which Basilides
          subjects to his general thoughts. God's "mind" (Gk. nous)
          descended upon Jesus as dove at the Jordan, and he proclaimed
          salvation to the Jews, the chosen people of the archon. The
          suffering of Jesus, Basilides admitted as a historical fact, but
          he did not understand how to utilize it religiously. The Spirit
          of God is the redeemer, not the crucified one. Jesus suffered as
          man, whose light-nature was also contaminated through the matter
          of evil. But the belief in the redemption which came from above
          lifts man beyond himself to a higher degree of existence. How
          far the individual can attain it depends on the degree of pure
          entanglement in former degrees of the spirit-world. In the
          perfected spirit-world the place will be assigned to each which
          belongs to him according to the degree of his faith.

    The Basilidians.

          Among the Basilidians, Basilides' son, Isidore, occupies a
          prominent place. Of his writings ("On the Excrescent Soul,"
          "Exegetics," "Ethics") some fragments are extant. The sect does
          not seem to have spread beyond Lower Egypt. In opposition to the
          rigid ethics of their master, the Basilidians seem often to have
          advocated libertinism. According to Clement of Alexandria they
          celebrated the sixth or the tenth of January as the day of the
          baptism of Jesus. On the importance of this fact for the origin
          of the ecclesiastical festival of the Epiphany, cf. H. Usener,
          Religionsgeschichtliche Untersuchungen, i (Bonn, 1889).

   Basnage
          BASNAGE, b??´´n?zh´: The name of a family of Normandy which has
          produced several men prominent in the history of French
          Protestantism.

          1. Benjamin Basnage was for fifty-one years pastor at
          Sainte-Mère-Église, near Carentan (27 m. s.e. of Cherbourg),
          where he was born in 1580 and died in 1652. During the religious
          wars he was repeatedly chosen by his coreligionists, on account
          of the constancy of his character and his great learning, to
          represent them in political and ecclesiastical assemblies. He
          was president of the general synod at Alençon in 1637 and as
          deputy at Charenton in 1644 he did much to defend the rights of
          the Protestants and to reconcile the theologians. In the year of
          his death he was ennobled by the government of Louis XIV. Of the
          many polemical tractates which he wrote, the best known is De
          l'état visible et invisible de l'Église et de la parfaite
          satisfaction de Jésus Christ, contre la fable du purgatoire (La
          Rochelle, 1612).

          2. Henri Basnage, younger son of Benjamin, was born at
          Sainte-Mère-Église Oct. 16, 1615; d. at Rouen Oct. 20, 1695. He
          was one of the most eloquent advocates in the parliament of
          Rouen and one of the most famous jurists of his time. He
          defended the cause of the Reformed Church courageously, and his
          reputation was such that after the revocation of the Edict of
          Nantes he was almost the only Protestant who could follow the
          profession of law in Rouen.

          3. Samuel Basnage, son of Antoine, younger son of Benjamin, was
          born at Bayeux 1638; d. at Zütphen 1721. He was first pastor at
          Vauxcelles, then at Bayeux till 1685. He went with his father to
          the Netherlands and became pastor there of the Walloon
          congregation at Zütphen. Of his theological writings the most
          important are: Morale théologique et politique sur les vertus et
          les vices des hommes (2 vols., Amsterdam, 1703); and Annales
          politico-ecclesiastici (3 vols., Rotterdam, 1706).

          4. Jacques Basnage (de Beauval), son of Henri, was born at Rouen
          Aug. 8, 1653; d. at The Hague Dec. 22, 1723. He first studied
          the classical languages at Saumur under Tanneguy, father of the
          famous Mme. Dacier; afterward theology at Geneva under Turretin
          and Tronchin, finally at Sédan under Jurieu. In 1676 he was
          chosen pastor at Rouen; after the suppression of the church at
          Rouen in 1685, Louis XIV granted him permission to retire to
          Holland. In 1691 he was made pastor of the Walloon congregation
          at Rotterdam, and in 1709 of the French congregation at The
          Hague. The prime minister Heinsius respected him highly and
          employed him in different diplomatic missions. The fame of his
          diplomatic ability reached the court at Versailles, and when, in
          1716, the Abbé Dubois was sent to The Hague by the Duke of
          Orléans, then regent, in behalf of the triple alliance, he was
          instructed to associate with Basnage. When an insurrection of
          the Camisards in the Cévennes was feared, the regent applied to
          Basnage. He supported energetically the zealous Antoine Court,
          then twenty years old, in restoring the Protestant Church in
          Southern France, but, partial to the principles of passive
          obedience, as preached by Calvin, he severely condemned the
          insurrection of the Camisards and even blamed the first
          preachers in the Desert. About this time the States General of
          the Netherlands appointed him historiographer. His numerous
          works are partly dogmatic or polemic, partly historical. The
          former include especially his writings against Bossuet: Examen
          des méthodes proposées par Messieurs de l'assemblée du clergé de
          France, en 1682, pour la réunion des Protestants à l'Église
          romaine (Cologne, 1682); Réponse à M. l'évêque de Meaux sur la
          lettre pastorale (1686). His historical works are: Histoire de
          la religion des Églises réformées (2 vols., Rotterdam, 1690;
          1725); Histoire de l'Église depuis Jésus Christ jusqu'à présent
          (1699); Histoires du Vieux et du Nouveau Testament, représentées
          par des figures gravées en taille-douce par R. de Hooge
          (Amsterdam, 1704); Histoire des Juifs depuis Jésus Christ
          jusqu'à présent (1706).

   Bassermann, Heinrich Gustav
          BASSERMANN, HEINRICH GUSTAV: German Lutheran; b. at
          Frankfort-on-the-Main July 12, 1849. He was educated at the
          universities of Jena, Zurich, and Heidelberg in 1868-73, but
          served in the campaign of 1870-71 in the First Baden Dragoons.
          He was assistant pastor at Arolsen, Waldeck, from 1873 to 1876,
          when he became privat-docent of New Testament exegesis at the
          University of Jena. In the same year he was appointed associate
          professor of practical theology at Heidelberg, and full
          professor and university preacher in 1880. He wrote: Dreissig

          edited the Zeitschrift für praktische Theologie in collaboration
          with Rudolf Ehlers. Died in Samaden (70 m. s.s.e. of St. Gall),
          Switzerland, Aug. 30, 1909.

   Bastholm, Christian
          BASTHOLM, CHRISTIAN: Danish court preacher, and an influential
          representative of the prevalent rationalism of his time; b. at
          Copenhagen Nov. 2, 1740; d. there Jan. 25, 1819. He had a varied
          education, and was specially attracted to philosophy and natural
          science, but was persuaded by his father to embrace a clerical
          career without any real love for Christian doctrine or the
          Church. He was preacher to the German congregation at Smyrna
          from 1768 to 1771. His renown as a great orator won him in 1778
          the position of court preacher, to which other court offices
          were subsequently added. Full of the ideas of the
          "Enlightenment," he felt called upon to be a missionary in their
          cause to his countrymen, and published a number of works in
          popular religious philosophy and history which have long since
          fallen into oblivion. His greatest success was his text-book of
          sacred oratory (1775), which so impressed Joseph II that he
          introduced it into all the higher educational institutions of
          the empire, though its recommendations seem laughable today. He
          published a history of the Jews (1777-82), attempting to
          "rationalize" it after Michaelis, and a translation of the New
          Testament with notes (1780). A small treatise on improvements in
          the liturgy (1785) aroused a storm of controversy; his idea was
          to make the service "interesting and diversified," after the
          model of balls and concerts; to exclude from hymnody not only
          everything dogmatic but all that was not joyous; and to
          eliminate from the sacramental rites whatever was contrary to
          sound reason. In the days of the French Revolution, he offered
          so many concessions to the antireligious spirit that he made
          himself ridiculous even in the eyes of freethinkers; and his
          book on "Wisdom and Happiness" (1794) taught a Stoicism only
          colored by Christianity. In 1795 he lost his library by fire,
          and with the new century withdrew from public life and
          authorship to live quietly with his son, a pastor at Slagelse,
          absorbed in the study of philosophy and science.

   Bates, William
          BATES, WILLIAM: English Presbyterian; b. at London Nov., 1625;
          d. at Hackney July 14, 1699. He was graduated at Cambridge 1647,
          and was vicar of St. Dunstan's-in-the-West, London, until 1662,
          when he lost the benefice for non-conformity; he was one of the
          commissioners to the [2]Savoy Conference (q.v.) in 1661 and
          represented the nonconformists on other occasions in
          negotiations with the Churchmen; was chaplain to Charles II and
          had influence in high places both under Charles and his
          successors. He is said to have been a polished preacher and a
          sound scholar. Perhaps the best known of his works is The
          Harmony of the Divine Attributes in the Contrivance and
          Accomplishment of Man's Redemption (2d ed., London, 1675). A
          collected edition of his works, with memoir by W. Farmer, was
          published in four volumes at London in 1815.

   Bathing
          BATHING: The bath in the East, because of the heat and the dust,
          is constantly necessary for the preservation of health, and to
          prevent skin-diseases. The bathing of the newly born is
          mentioned in Ezek. xvi, 4; bathing as part of the toilet in Ruth
          iii, 3; II Sam. xii, 20; Ezek. xxiii, 40, and elsewhere. As the
          Law attached great religious value to the purity of the body, it
          prescribed bathing and ablutions for cases in which it was
          apparently impaired (see [3]Defilement and Purification,
          Ceremonial). Ablution was required when one approached the deity
          (cf. Gen. xxxv, 2; Exod. xix, 10; Lev. xvi, 4, for the high
          priest on the Day of .Atonement). Bathing in "living" (i.e.,
          running) water was regarded as most effective in every respect
          (Exod. ii, 5; II Kings v, 10; Lev. xv, 13). More accessible and
          convenient were the baths arranged in the houses. To a
          well-furnished house belonged a courtyard, in which was a
          bath--according to II Sam. xi, 2, an open basin. Susannah
          (verses 15 sqq.) bathes in a hedged garden and uses oil and some
          kind of soap; the Hebrew women used bran in the bath, or to dry
          themselves, (Mishnah Pesahim ii, 7). The feet, being protected
          by sandals only, were exposed to dust and dirt, and no attentive
          host omitted to give to his guests water for their feet before
          he entertained them (Gen. xviii, 4; xix, 2; I Sam. xxv, 41; cf.
          Luke vii, 44; John xiii, 1-10). The washing of hands before
          meals was customary for obvious reasons; but it is not expressly
          attested before New Testament time, and then as a religious
          enactment which the Pharisees rigidly observed (Matt. xv, 2;
          Luke xi, 38); so in general with reference to washings and
          bathings the punctilious were at that time more exacting. The
          efficacy of warm springs was recognized at a very early period
          (cf. Gen. xxxvi, 24, R. V., and the name Hammath, Josh. xix, 35;
          xxi, 32). They were found near Tiberias (Josephus, War, II, xxi,
          6; Ant., XVIII, ii, 3; Life, xvi; Pliny, v, 15), Gadara, the
          capital of Peræa, and Callirrhoë, east of the Dead Sea
          (Josephus, War, I, xxxiii, 5; Pliny, v, 16). Public baths are
          mentioned in Josephus, Ant., XIX, vii, 5, but their existence in
          Palestine can not be proved before the Greco-Roman time.

          C. von Orelli.

          Abuses connected with the public baths in early Christian times
          called forth protests from many of the heathen and led some of
          the emperors to attempt restrictive precautions. The Church
          Fathers also raised their voices, but it is noteworthy that
          though there was public censure (e.g., of women, particularly of
          virgins who were immodest in the bath), there was no formal,
          ecclesiastical prohibition of the public baths. The use of the
          bath was remitted during public calamities, penance, Lent, and
          for the first week after baptism. From the time of Constantine
          it was usual to build baths near the basilicas, partly for the
          use of the clergy, and partly for other ecclesiastical purposes.

          Christian, DCA, i, 182-183; the article "Baden" in KL, i,

   Bath Kol
          BATH KOL: Literally "daughter of the voice," an expression which
          signifies in itself nothing more than a call or echo, for which
          it is also used. When the term is applied to a divine
          manifestation, it implies that it was audible to the human
          hearing without a personal theophany. In the Old Testament the
          notion is found in Dan. iv, 28 (A. V. 31), "a voice fell from
          heaven." In the New Testament similar ideas are the heavenly
          voice at the baptism of Jesus (Matt. iii, 17; Mark i, 11; Luke
          iii, 22), at his transfiguration (Matt. xvii, 5; Mark ix, 7;
          Luke ix, 35), before his passion (John xii, 28), and the voices
          from heaven heard by Paul and Peter (Acts ix, 4; cf. xxii, 7 and
          xxvi, 14; x, 13, 15). A voice from the sanctuary is mentioned by
          Josephus (Ant., XIII, x, 3; cf. Bab. So?ah 33a; Jerus. So?ah
          24b), and was called bath kol by the rabbis, who were of opinion
          that such heavenly voices were heard during all the time of
          Israel's history, even in their own time. According to Bab.
          So?ah 48b; Yomah 9a, this "voice" was the only divine means of
          revelation after the extinction of prophecy. They narrate
          legendary stories of such divine voices which settled religious
          difficulties. Different from the bath kol proper is the idea
          that natural sounds or words heard by accident are significant
          heavenly voices. This superstition was not uncommon, as Jerus.
          Shabbat 8c shows. Rabbi Joshua was of the opinion that such
          things must not influence any legal decision (Bab. Baba Me?ia
          59b; Berakot 51b). Rabbi Johanan lays down as general rule that
          that which was heard in the city must be the voice of a man, in
          the desert that of a woman, and that either a twofold "Yea" or
          twofold "Nay" is heard (Bab. Megillah 32a).

          University, the Philadelphia Divinity School, and the University
          of Pennsylvania. He was ordered deacon in 1886 and ordained
          priest in the following year, and was instructor and professor
          of the Old Testament in the Philadelphia Divinity School from
          1888 to 1899, when he became rector of St. Mark's, New York
          City. He is also lecturer on the Old Testament in the General
          Theological Seminary, New York City. In addition to numerous
          briefer studies, he has written The Old Testament from the

   Baudissin, Wolf Wilhelm, Graf von
          BAUDISSIN, WOLF WILHELM, GRAF VON: German Protestant; b. at
          Sophienhof, near Kiel, Germany, Sept. 26, 1847. He was educated
          at the universities of Erlangen, Berlin, Leipsic (Ph.D., 1870),
          and Kiel from 1866 to 1872, and was privat-docent at Leipsic in
          1874-76, when he accepted a call to the University of Strasburg
          as associate professor of theology. Four years later he was
          promoted to full professor, but in the following year went to
          Marburg as professor of Old Testament exegesis. He remained at
          Marburg, where he was rector in 1893-94, until 1900, when he
          went to Berlin as professor of Old Testament exegesis, a chair
          which he still holds. In theology he is an adherent of the
          historical school of investigation, and seeks to elucidate the
          religion of the Old Testament by other Semitic faiths. He has
          written: Translationis antiquæ arabicæ libri Jobi quæ supersunt
          nunc primum edita (Leipsic, 1870); Eulogius und Alvar, ein

   Bauer, Bruno
          BAU´ER, BRUNO: A modern Biblical critic, of the most extreme
          radicalism; b. at Eisenberg (35 m. s. of Halle), in the duchy of
          Altenburg, Sept. 6, 1809; d. at Rixdorf, near Berlin, Apr. 15,
          1882. He was educated in Berlin precisely in Hegel's most
          brilliant period. He took his place at first in the conservative
          wing of the Hegelian school, of which his teacher Marheineke was
          the leader, and reviewed the Leben Jesu of David Friedrich
          Strauss, who had been his fellow student, unfavorably, accusing
          Strauss of "entire ignorance of what criticism means." He
          undertook also to defend Marheineke's position by issuing
          (1836-38) the Zeitschrift für spekulative Theologie. In 1838 he
          published the Kritik der Geschichte der Offenbarung (2 vols.,
          Berlin). A year later Altenstein, minister of public worship and
          instruction, appointed him to a position is the University of
          Bonn, and his prospects seemed promising. But he was already in
          a fair way to break with his past, as shortly appeared in his
          Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte des Johannes (Bremen, 1840)
          and Kritik der evangelischen Geschichte der Synoptiker (3 vols.,
          Leipsic,1841), which went beyond Strauss, and, adopting the
          theory of Wilke that Mark is the original gospel, derived the
          whole story, not, with Strauss, from the imagination of the
          primitive Christian community, but from that of a single mind.
          This extreme carrying out of Hegelian principles naturally
          aroused wide-spread excitement. Eichhorn, who had succeeded
          Altenstein as minister, put the question to the Prussian
          universities whether the holder of such views could be allowed
          to teach. The answers were not unanimous; but Bauer injured his
          own cause by a still more amazing and reckless onslaught on
          traditional theology (Theologische Schamlosigkeiten, in the
          Hallische Jahrbücher für deutsche Wissenschaft, Nov., 1841), and
          was deprived of his academic post in March, 1842. His literary
          activity continued incessant. Living on his small estate at
          Rixdorf, he poured forth a succession of volumes on the history
          of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries between 1843 and
          1849. In 1850 he came back to his old field, and in the next
          three years had renewed his attack on the gospels and included
          the Acts and the Pauline epistles, considering even the four
          admitted by the Tübingen school as second-century Western
          products. In the place of Christ and Paul, to him Philo, Seneca,
          and the Gnostics appeared the real creative forces in the
          evolution of Christian conceptions. He continued his attempts to
          prove the connection between Greco-Roman philosophy and
          Christianity in Christus und die Cäsaren (Berlin, 1877). Here he
          places the genesis of the Christian religion practically as late
          as the reign of Marcus Aurelius, and the original gospel in that
          of Hadrian, after which "clever men" were busy for some forty
          years in the composition of the Pauline epistles. Only the
          framework of the new religion was Jewish; its spirit came from
          further west; Christianity is really "Stoicism becoming dominant
          in a Jewish metamorphosis." Bauer left practically no followers
          in Germany for such remarkable theories. His fantastic
          hypercriticism found a home for a time in Holland with Allard
          Pierson, Naber, and Loman; and still later it made some attempts
          to gain a foothold in Switzerland with Steck's assault upon
          Galatians.

          year he also founded the Institute of Historical Research at
          Washington, and has since been its president. In theology he is
          a firm believer in the historical accuracy of the Bible. He has

          Nov. 28, 1878. When he was thirteen years of age, he was sent to
          Strasburg to the house of his uncle, where he prepared himself
          for the ministry. Having completed his studies, he was made
          teacher at, the theological seminary at Strasburg in 1835. This
          position he resigned in 1844 and accepted the position of vicar
          of St. Thomas's in that city, whose first preacher he became in
          1847. At the close of the Franco-Prussian war, the German
          government appointed him professor in the University of
          Strasburg. He belonged to the liberal Protestant party of his
          country, and made himself known by his writings on the history
          of the Reformation, as well as that of his own time, including
          Franz Lambert von Avignon (Strasburg and Paris, 1840); Theodor
          Beza nach handschriftlichen Quellen dargestellt (2 vols.,
          Leipsic, 1843-45); Johann Georg Stuber, der Vorg?nger Oberlins

   Baumgarten, Michael
          BAUMGARTEN, MICHAEL: German theologian and active promoter of
          free church life; b. at Haseldorf, near Hamburg, Mar. 25, 1812;
          d. at Rostock July 21, 1889. He was educated at Altona, Kiel,
          and Berlin, becoming in the last-named place an outspoken
          adherent of Hengstenberg. But the study of Dorner during a
          period of seven years (1839-46) spent at Kiel as a teacher
          convinced him that the traditional orthodox view of the person
          of Christ was inadequate to explain the mystery of redemption;
          he passed from Hengstenberg to Schleiermacher, with his
          principle that Christianity is not a doctrine but a life, and
          then to Hofmann, in whose Weissagung und Erfüllung he saw a
          theology that could lead him further on his road. In his
          treatise Liturgie und Predigt (Kiel, 1843) he lays down his
          programme, to which as an old man he was still proud of having
          adhered. Here he classes as stumbling blocks in the Church's way
          a variety of ancient institutions, laws, and customs, viz.: the
          misleading notion of a "Christian State"; the use of compulsion
          in the Church (as in the case of baptism); the power of civil
          rulers within the Church, in allowing which the Reformers had
          brought back a Byzantine system; the diversity of teaching among
          Protestants; and the failure to recognize the menace of the
          Roman errors. About the same time (1843-44) appeared his
          commentary on the Pentateuch, to which Delitzsch appealed when
          in 1850 he recommended his friend to succeed him in the Rostock
          professorship, but which none the less he sharply criticized in
          some points. In the eventful years 1846-50 he was pastor of St.
          Michael's church at Sleswick, and was one of the leaders of the
          clergy of Sleswick Holstein in their struggle for the German
          right to the duchies. After the battle of Idstedt, he was
          obliged to escape from Sleswick with his family to Holstein,
          where his call to Rostock found him. Here he was expected to
          take part in the upbuilding of the Church of the duchy, which
          was under Kliefoth's leadership; but two men more diametrically
          opposed in their whole way of looking at things could scarcely
          have been found. Baumgarten frankly expressed his own view of
          the earliest history of the Church in his Apostelgeschichte (2
          vols., Halle, 1852), and of its modern needs in his
          Nachtgesichte Sacharjas (Brunswick, 1854). It was not difficult
          to make a collection of heretical propositions from the writings
          of a man who cared so little to express himself in time-honored
          formulas, and who was wrestling with such modern problems; and
          the attempt was soon made. The Grand Duke dismissed him from the
          theological commission in 1856; the consistory examined his
          works, it must be admitted without strict adherence to
          constitutional rules or to the principles of fairness, found a
          whole series of departures from the received doctrine, and
          deprived him of his position. He declined an invitation to go to
          India as a missionary, preferring to remain and carry on the
          struggle for a complete reconstruction of the Evangelical Church
          in Germany. With this aim he was for thirteen years a zealous
          member of the Protestant Union from 1863 to 1876, but left it
          when it showed intolerance in the Heidelberg case. His life grew
          more and more lonely, though he could always count on a few
          faithful friends, like Studt, Ziegler, and Pestalozzi. He was a
          member of the Reichstag from 1874 to 1881, in which he showed
          himself a determined opponent of Stöcker and of the Jesuits, and
          stood for his principles of religious liberty and complete
          separation of Church and State. He was a man of great natural
          endowment, fitted for useful constructive work in theology, if
          the unfortunate circumstances in his career had not forced him
          to expend his energy in the combat to which most of his numerous
          later writings have reference.

          at Halle July 4, 1757. He studied at the Halle Orphan Asylum, of
          which his father had been first inspector, and at the University
          of Halle. He became inspector of the Halle Latin School in 1726,
          assistant preacher to the younger G. A. Franks in 1728,
          associate on the theological faculty in 1730, and ordinary
          professor in 1743. He was a good teacher and his lectures were
          usually attended by from 300 to 400 hearers. His learning was
          vast and he was an industrious writer, publishing voluminous
          works on exegesis, hermeneutics, morals, dogmatics, and history,
          such as Auszug der Kirchengeschichte (4 vols., Halle, 1743-62);
          Evangelische Glaubenslehre (3 vols., 1759-60); Geschichte der
          Religionsparteien (1760); Nachricht von merkwürdigen Büchern (12
          vols., 1752-57); and the first sixteen volumes in the Allgemeine
          Welthistorie (1744 sqq.). By adopting the formal scheme of the
          philosophy of Wolff and applying it to the theological ideas in
          which he was educated, Baumgarten came to form a transition from
          the Pietism of Spener and Francke to the modern rationalism. His
          enthusiastic disciple, J. S. Semler, who was called from Altdorf
          to Halle on his recommendation, edited many of his works and
          wrote his biography (Halle, 1758).

          31, 1788; d. at Jena May 31, 1843. He studied theology and
          philology at Leipsic and became university preacher there in
          1810; in 1812 extraordinary professor of theology at Jena,
          ordinary professor, 1817. He gave lectures on all branches of
          so-called theoretic theology except church history, especially
          New Testament exegesis, Biblical theology, dogmatics, ethics,
          and history of doctrine. Gentle and sympathetic, and shrinking
          from theological strife, he was misunderstood in his time. His
          exegesis was painstaking, free from prejudice, and acute; as
          historian of dogma he understood the origin and development of
          religious ideas and doctrines as few others have done; and as

          Their Weakness and Decline (§ 4).

          The treatment of both Ferdinand Christian Baur and the Later
          Tübingen School in the same article is justified by the fact
          that the period of distinctive theological and philosophical
          views which characterized the school in its palmy days really
          ceased with the death of its founder, or at least lost the
          former local identification. Considering the Tübingen School in
          this strictly limited sense, its history, together with that of
          Baur himself, may be divided into three periods--that of
          preparation, or of the history of dogma, before 1835; that of
          prosperity, or of Biblical criticism, 1835-1848; and that of
          disintegration, or of church history, after the latter date.

  I. The Period of the History of Dogma.

    1. Baur's Early Life and Activity.

          Baur was born at Schmiden, near Cannstatt (4 m. n.e. of
          Stuttgart), June 21, 1792; he died at Tübingen Dec. 2, 1860. He
          was the son of a Württemberg pastor and was educated first at
          Blaubeuren and then (1809-14) at Tübingen. Here, besides
          following the usual thorough course in philology, he was
          strongly attracted by the study of philosophy. Fichte and
          Schelling were then at the height of their influence; but that
          it did not draw the young student away from the standpoint of
          the older [4]Tübingen School, in which he had been brought up,
          may be seen from his first published writing, a review of
          Kaiser's Biblische Theologie in 1817, which condemned
          rationalistic caprice in the treatment of the Old Testament.
          After a short employment as tutor in the Tübingen seminary
          during the same year, he was named professor in the lower
          seminary which had grown out of his old school at Blaubeuren.
          The nine years of his stay here were active and happy ones.
          Though his work was mainly philological and historical, he
          showed his interest in the philosophical and theological
          movements of the time. The doctrines of Schleiermacher received
          his attention, and found an echo in his three-volume work
          Symbolik und Mythologie (Stuttgart, 1824-25). In this book,
          remarkable for its time, he indicated his future course in the
          phrase, "Without philosophy, history seems to me dumb and dead."
          The attention it attracted won Baur a place in the theological
          faculty of Tübingen on its reorganization (1826) after the death
          of his old teacher Bengel. His impressive and inspiring
          personality at once drew the young men to him, and his influence
          in the faculty was contested only by Dr. Steudel, the sole
          survivor of the old school body.

    2. Baur's Relation to Schleiermacher and Hegel.

          The fact that in the course of his further intellectual
          development Baur gradually came into conflict with the theology
          of Schleiermacher may be partly explained by the difference in
          the mental constitutions of the two men. There was no trace in
          Baur's method of the fusion of sentiment and reason which
          characterized the other; only the intellectual side was allowed
          to be heard. His strong point was his faculty of conceiving
          historical phenomena objectively, amid the surroundings and from
          the standpoint of their age. His relation to the philosophy of
          Hegel is somewhat difficult to determine exactly; but it may be
          safely asserted that his fundamental views on the essence of
          religion and the course of history were taken from the Hegelian
          system. The transition from Schleiermacher to Hegel was a
          gradual process which took place between 1826 and 1835, in the
          nine years which have been called the period of preparation. It
          is probable that at first Baur was unconscious of its extent,
          and it was not until he applied the Hegelian principles to the
          canon that they brought him into sharp conflict with traditional
          orthodoxy. His Symbolik was logically followed by his works on
          Manicheanism and Gnosticism (Tübingen, 1831 and 1832)--phenomena
          lying on the border between theology and philosophy, between
          Christianity and paganism. In his tractate on the opposition
          between Roman Catholicism and Protestantism, in answer to Möhler
          (Tübingen, 1834), Hegelian terminology begins to appear
          distinctly, though the foundation still rests on Schleiermacher.
          The influence of the Hegelian system on Baur was a very
          fructifying one. No department of history had suffered more from
          the leveling tendency of rationalism than the history of dogma.
          Since Hegel had taught the application of the iron rule of
          development to the phenomena of the intellectual life as well as
          to other phenomena, he pointed the way to a profounder
          understanding of the beliefs which appeared frequently so
          haphazard and so arbitrary, to a knowledge of laws which
          prevailed over individual will. Thus, when Baur went on from the
          philosophy of religion to Christian dogma, and in that to the
          most important parts (the Atonement, Tübingen, 1838, the Trinity
          and the Incarnation, 1841-43), he became a pioneer of the
          history of dogma in the modern sense. Even though the Hegelian
          categories proved a bed of Procrustes for Christian dogmas, and
          though the understanding of these suffered from the defects of
          the Hegelian conception of religion, the impulse had none the
          less been given to a profounder study. More recent historians of
          dogma have felt themselves entitled to correct Baur's views, as
          set forth in the above-mentioned works, in almost every point;
          but these views had won him, by the end of this first period, a
          prominent place in the ranks of those who were trying to strike
          out new lines in the study of Christian history; and when
          Schleiermacher's chair at Berlin was vacant in 1834, the
          Prussian minister Altenstein thought for a time of appointing
          Baur to it.

  II. The Period of Biblical Criticism

          The second period, however, is the one which comes to mind when
          the Tübingen School is mentioned. Though certain books already
          named are of later date, the period may be properly begun with
          1835, in which year Strauss's Leben Jesu drew general attention
          to the questions to which Baur was already inclined to turn. The
          application to the canon of Scripture of the Hegelian laws of
          historical development was peculiarly appropriate to the place
          in which Baur carried on his work, since the distinguishing mark
          of the older Tübingen School had been a Biblical
          supernaturalism, for which dogma was nothing more than the
          teachings of Scripture, arrived at by means of exegesis. He felt
          himself driven to a consideration of this question by the need
          of a settlement with the school from which he had sprung and
          with his own past; by his studies in the history of dogma, since
          the source of dogma, in the last resort, unless it is a mere
          collection of irresponsible opinions, is the Bible; and by his
          investigation of Gnosticism, which could not fail to raise the
          question of the canon.

    1. Historico-Critical Study of the New Testament.

          In 1835 appeared (at Stuttgart and Tübingen) Baur's work on the
          Pastoral Epistles. According to his own account of this and of
          his article on the Corinthian parties (TZT, 1831), it was his
          lectures on the Epistle to the Corinthians which first opened up
          the vista of more far-reaching historico-critical investigation
          into the controversies of the apostolic age, and led him to
          follow out, by means of New Testament and patristic studies, his
          independent conception of the clash of heterogeneous elements in
          the apostolic and subapostolic days, their parties and
          tendencies, their conflicts and compromises--to demonstrate the
          growth of a catholic Church as nothing but the result of a
          previous historical process. Dealing with Schleiermacher's
          treatment of I Timothy, he considered the three pastoral
          epistles from the same historical standpoint, and defined the
          task of New Testament criticism by asserting that the origin of
          such writings (as to the authenticity of which more evidence was
          needed than the accepted name of an author on their face and a
          vague, uncertain, and late tradition) could only be explained by
          a complete view of the whole range of historical circumstances
          in which, according to definite data, they were to be placed.
          With this character of historic objectivity, the new criticism,
          which naturally could not but seem merely negative and
          destructive in contrast with the unfounded assumptions that it
          controverted, intended to meet the arbitrary subjectivity of the
          hypotheses which had, up to that time, played so large a part in
          New Testament criticism. The above statement, substantially in
          Baur's own words, expresses fully the guiding principle of the
          Tübingen School. In the name of fidelity to fact, Baur was
          conducting a regular siege of the fortifications which had been
          thrown up by his own predecessors around the Christian
          doctrines, when Strauss's assault upon the central bastion
          attracted general attention. It was not without value to him as
          a diversion, under cover of which he was able to pursue
          undisturbed for a while longer his critical work. During the
          next decade the Tübingen School acquired an importance which
          seemed to threaten the foundations of dogma from a new quarter,
          relentlessly contrasting the accepted image of Christ, as drawn
          according to the subjective Christian mind by Schleiermacher,
          with the results of objective historical criticism. The main
          part of the task seemed to be left to Baur himself; he was not
          so fortunate as the leaders of the old Tübingen School, who had
          their allies in the other theological chairs. On the other hand,
          he had with him a large number of young and enthusiastic
          disciples, such as the talented Eduard Zeller, later his
          son-in-law, the still bolder and braver Schwegler, Köstlin and
          Planck, Ritschl and Hilgenfeld, the last two the most prominent
          allies who came from outside of Württemberg.

    2. Applied to the Writings of Paul.

          Baur had begun his critical work with Paul, and the same apostle
          engaged the attention of the school in its later publications.
          Searching investigations of the Epistle to the Romans appeared
          in the TZT in 1836, and aroused alarm and opposition. These,
          together with considerable material which he had published in
          the Theologische Jahrbücher, begun in 1842 by Zeller and edited
          from 1847 to 1857 by himself and Zeller jointly, which became
          the organ of the new school, he put together in 1845 (Stuttgart)
          into a monograph on Paul. The result reached by this part of his
          work was the denial of the authenticity of all the letters
          passing under the apostle's name, except Galatians, I and II
          Corinthians, and Romans, of which last also the two concluding
          chapters were questioned. Finally, in agreement with
          Schneckenburger but still more radically, the postapostolic
          origin of the Acts was asserted. It was not difficult to
          conjecture what would happen to the Gospels when they were
          thrown into the same crucible.

    3. The Fundamental Assumption of the School.

          The theory of the "objective criticism," as it developed, was
          that the older apostles, with their original body of disciples,
          were differentiated from the other Jews only by their belief
          that the crucified Jesus was the Messiah. All the elements of a
          new religion contained in his life and teaching were forgotten,
          or lay undeveloped in the apostles' memory, though a Stephen
          attempted to enforce them and sealed his testimony by his death.
          When Paul, by a wonderful divination, by a train of reasoning
          from the cross and the resurrection, rediscovered these elements
          of universality and freedom, the Church stood suspiciously
          aloof. The older apostles, indeed, with a liberality difficult
          to understand in the premises, accepted Paul as an equal fellow
          laborer and admitted his right to the mission to the Gentiles.
          But a section of the Church remained obstinately hostile. Paul
          appears, therefore, constantly prepared for combat, and when an
          epistle presents him in any other mood, it is ipso facto
          unauthentic. In view of these facts, it became all the more
          necessary for the next age to emphasize the unity of the Church;
          when, accordingly, there is perceived a conciliatory tone in an
          epistle, when it speaks much of the Church and its unity of
          belief, no further mark of a postapostolic origin is needed. The
          school believed itself able to prove from the Apocalypse,
          considered as a product not merely of Judaic narrowness but of
          positive opposition to Paulinism, and still more from the
          pseudo-Clementine homilies, that no accommodation took place in
          the apostles' lifetime.

    4. Applied to the Gospels.

          These views, for all their possible usefulness as against an
          exaggerated notion in the opposite direction, still left one
          question unanswered?what really was the Christianity of Christ?
          This led inevitably to the question, burning since Strauss, of
          the status of the Gospels; but it was nearly ten years before
          Baur brought his disciples to that. In the Jahrbuch for 1844 he
          attempted to use his critical principles to disprove the
          authenticity of the Gospel of John. This treatment he
          supplemented by further investigations on the canonical gospels,
          and published the whole result in substantive form in 1847
          (Tübingen). In a certain sense it was favorable to the
          traditional view. The order of the canon was approximately that
          of their composition. Matthew, in whom the Judaic tendency is
          strongest, would then be nearest to the source; Mark would show
          a tendency to accommodation and minimizing of differences; and
          this would show all the more clearly the Pauline tendency of
          Luke. The fourth Gospel, finally, was supposed to display in
          every feature the tendency to sink these differences in a higher
          unity, and to take a stand for the conflicts of the second
          century, Gnosticism, Montanism, and the nascent Trinitarian
          controversy. This work of Baur's marks the close of the great
          period of the school. His disciples were now ready to come to
          his aid. Schwegler's book on Montanism (Tübingen, 1841),
          Ritschl's on Luke and the Gospel of Marcion (Tübingen, 1846) and
          on the origin of the primitive catholic Church (Bonn, 1850),
          Köstlin's on the Johannine system (Berlin, 1843), were all
          important; but the most significant was Schwegler's on the
          subapostolic age (Tübingen, 1846), which attempted constructive
          reasoning, using the writings which had been declared
          unauthentic as memorials of the development of Judaism and
          Paulinism into what came later.

    5. Developed by Schwegler.

          According to Schwegler, Judaism had no need of further
          development; the impulse came from Paulinism, in such a way that
          the Judaic party decided, in order to preserve the unity of the
          Church (Gk. monarchia), to make some concessions, requiring
          things of similar import with those demanded by the
          pseudadelphoi of the New Testament, but more easily fulfilled by
          the Gentiles. If circumcision had to be abandoned, so much the
          more weight was laid upon baptism as the Christian equivalent;
          if the works of the Law were dropped, works were still required;
          Israel's primacy vanished, but a general aristocratic tendency
          could be maintained in the episcopate; Paul could not be cast
          out, but he could be subordinated to Peter. Schwegler then
          watches this development and compromise in two places, Rome and
          Asia Minor. In Rome he traces the succession of writings of
          Judaistic origin thus: first the Shepherd of Hermas and
          Hegesippus; then Justin, the Clementine Homilies, and the
          Apostolic Constitutions; then James, the Second Epistle of
          Clement, Mark, the Clementine Recognitions, and II Peter. On the
          Pauline side he finds the conciliatory writings to begin under
          Trajan with I Peter; then follow Luke and Acts; then the
          Pastoral Epistles and the letters of Ignatius. Montanism being
          in his view only an offshoot of Judaism, the Pauline victory
          falls in the pontificate of Victor (189-199), under whom
          Montanism was condemned at Rome. The Pauline party, indeed, had
          already made no slight concessions, in order to ward off
          Gnosticism?though the Gnostics and especially the Marcionites
          ultimately were of great service to Paulinism in securing the
          universality of Christianity.

          He sees the process as somewhat different in Asia Minor, where
          the opponents of Paul rallied, not as in Rome around Peter, but
          around John; here the solution was the formation of a body of
          Christian dogma, while in Rome it had been a unity of
          organization with a Roman primacy. While at Rome the supposed
          Ebionite works are more numerous than the Pauline, it is the
          contrary in Asia Minor; the Apocalypse is here the single
          Ebionite memorial, while on the other side Galatians,
          Colossians, Ephesians, and the Johannine Gospel form an imposing
          series of steps in the development. Bold, however, and
          fascinating as are the combinations set forth in this work, and
          brilliant as is its execution, it may be pointed out (though
          space does not permit of illustration) that there is scarcely a
          theologian today who is disposed to accept this train of
          reasoning as even an approximately satisfactory solution of the
          problems suggested. And even in those days, the starting-point
          of the whole process of development still remained to be
          discussed. It was already obvious that without tracing it back
          to the person and teaching of Christ, the question of how the
          primitive catholic Church came into existence was insoluble.
          Attempts in the direction of establishing the entire critical
          position by showing a genetic development of the earliest
          organization and dogma out of the gospel of Christ himself
          marked a third period in the history of the Tübingen School.

  III. The Period of Church History

    1. Political Complications.

          The political upheaval of 1848 had its influence on the future
          of the school. The attempts made here and there to introduce its
          conclusions, under cover of the political movements of the time,
          into the general life of the Church could not fail to bring up
          the question whether ecclesiastical activity was possible for
          adherents of the school. It was answered in the negative not
          only by opponents; some of Baur's own disciples felt that they
          must either modify the scientific conclusions they had learned
          from him, or seek a secular calling, as Märklin, whose life was
          written by Strauss, had done in 1840. It was not surprising,
          then, that the German governments thought twice before
          appointing to academic positions men whose influence was so
          disturbing, and that the younger generation hesitated to follow
          Baur further, after his most important disciple, Zeller, was
          obliged in 1849 to exchange a theological chair for that of
          philosophy at Marburg. Baur felt the isolation in which he thus
          began to find himself; but his temperament allowed him to hold
          fast longer than others to the illusion of the identity of
          church teaching and Hegelian speculation. He relaxed nothing of
          his zeal for the solution of the important problem which still
          remained, the establishment on a critical foundation of a
          positive story of the development of Christianity from its
          origin down through the centuries.

    2. Baur's Works on Church History.

          In 1852 Baur published a book (Leipsic) on the epochs of church
          history as a preliminary, containing brilliant and frequently
          sharp criticism of earlier historians. His own efforts in this
          direction began with the work Das Christenthum und die
          christliche Kirche der drei ersten Jahrhunderte (Leipsic, 1853),
          and was continued in Die christliche Kirche vom Anfang des 4.
          bis Ausgang des 6. Jahrhunderts (Leipsic, 1859). After his death
          appeared (Leipsic, 1861) the third part, completed by himself,
          Die christliche Kirche des Mittelalters in den Hauptmomenten
          ihrer Entwicklung; and two further volumes were published from
          his carefully prepared lecturenotes?Kirchengeschichte des 19.
          Jahrhunderts, edited by Zeller (Leipsic, 1862), and
          Kirchengeschichte der neueren Zeit von der Reformation bis zum
          Ende des 18. Jahrhunderts, edited by his son Ferdinand (Leipsic,
          1863), thus completing the entire survey.

    3. His Theories and Conclusions.

          If there is sought in these books an answer to the question as
          to the real primitive Christianity which lay back of Paul and
          back of Ebionitism, as to the person of Christ himself, it may
          be put, once more substantially in Baur's own words (from the
          important controversial pamphlet against Uhlhorn, Die Tübinger
          Schule und ihre Stellung zur Gegenwart, Leipsic, 1859), as
          follows: The real inwardness of Christianity, its essential
          center point, may be found in what belongs to the strictly
          ethical content of the teaching of Jesus, in the Sermon on the
          Mount, the parables, and similar utterances; in his doctrine of
          the Kingdom of God and the conditions of membership in it,
          designed to place men in the right ethical relation to God. This
          is the really divine, the universally human element in it, the
          part of its content which is eternal and absolute. What raises
          Christianity above all other religions is nothing but the purely
          ethical character of its acts, teachings, and requirements. If
          this is the essential content of the consciousness of Jesus, it
          is one of the two factors which compose his personality; it must
          have a corresponding form, in order to enter, in the way of
          historical development, into the general consciousness of
          humanity; and this form is the Jewish conception of the Messiah,
          the point of contact between the mind of Jesus and the world
          that was to believe in him, the basis on which alone a religious
          community destined to broaden into a Church could be built. We
          can, therefore, have no clear and definite conception of the
          personality of Jesus if we do not distinguish these two sides of
          it and consider them, so to speak, under the aspect of an
          antinomy, of a process which develops itself gradually.

    4. Their Weakness and Decline.

          If we try to get at the heart of Baur's whole view of the
          subject, stripping his presentation of its somewhat pathetic
          enthusiasm, it will appear not so very different from Kant's
          expression, that the faith of pure reason came in with Christ,
          indeed, but was so overlaid in the subsequent history that if
          the question were asked which was the best period in the entire
          course of church history, it might be unhesitatingly answered by
          the choice of the present, in which a nearer approach than ever
          before is made to pure religious doctrine. As long as Baur had
          gone no further into the really primitive essential import of
          Christianity than to consider the Pauline dogmatics as
          representing it, the development of the Church could perfectly
          well seem to him to have proceeded in a wholly rational manner.
          The dogmatic and ecclesiastical decisions of the early ages
          could, in their context, appear "reasonable," and Baur himself,
          in contrast with a writer like Gottfried Arnold or with the
          unhistoric rationalism, almost an orthodox historian, always in
          harmony with the course of events as it proceeded. Not only
          Athanasius and Augustine, but Gregory VII and Innocent III had
          full justice at his hands. But this involved an equally tolerant
          acknowledgment of the claims of the nineteenth century. If the
          humanitarianism of Goethe and Schiller seemed better adapted to
          the needs of educated men in this age than the Church in its
          older form, here also the living must take precedence; and
          suddenly the place of the old Church was taken by a broad
          "communion" in which all the heroes of the intellect, even the
          most modern, took their place as saints. But when the question
          came to be asked what this prevalent humanism had in common with
          ancient Christianity, it became apparent that the whole long
          process of development was really a totally unnecessary détour,
          whose purpose it was difficult to discover. It could scarcely be
          denied that a historical method which saw the essence of
          Christianity in ethics exclusively, which knew nothing of the
          need of redemption, and which was unable to give any positive
          account of the person of Christ, was one in which the Hegelian
          conception of development practically disappeared. Yet the
          distinguishing mark of the school of Baur had been the
          application of this very conception to Christian history,
          especially that of the primitive age--the attempt to show the
          course of history as rational and necessary; and thus, in the
          person of its head, the Tübingen School deserted the fundamental
          principle which in its palmy days it had sought to enforce. It
          was, then, not surprising that uncertainty showed itself among
          the members of the school on the question of the Gospels. The
          less a definite tendency could be proved in the synoptics, the
          more they were shown to offer at least a substratum of purely
          historical matter, so much the more pressing became the question
          how the school's view of history could be reconciled with the
          actual course of events. When the attempt to construct the
          latter a priori, failed, an advantage was given to the
          "literary-historical" method with which Hilgenfeld undertook to
          replace the criticism of tendency. In his Historisch-kritische
          Einleitung in das neue Testament (Leipsic, 1875) the Tübingen
          views were modified in a large number of points. Thus the
          results supposed to have been attained by the "objective
          criticism" of Baur were called in question by his own fellow
          workers; and when he died, it is hardly too much to say that his
          school, at least in the narrower sense, died with him.

          was a pupil of Cousin and a student of German philosophy, and,
          his teaching not being acceptable to the church authorities, he
          was suspended in 1822. He modified his views and took holy
          orders in 1828, and resumed teaching. In 1834 he again fell into
          difficulty with the Bishop of Strasburg because of his teachings
          concerning the relation of reason and faith; is 1838 he went to
          Rome and sought in vain to have his views approved there. In
          1840 he submitted, became vicar-general of Paris in 1849, and
          professor at the Sorbonne in 1853. He held that the human reason
          can not prove such facts as the existence of God and the
          immortality of the soul, and that the truths of religion are
          communicated purely by divine revelation. His most important

   Bavaria
          BAVARIA: A kingdom in the southern part of the German Empire,
          and, next to Prussia, the largest of the states of the Empire;
          area, 29,282 square miles; population (1900), 6,176,057, of whom
          4,357,133 (70.5 per cent.) are Roman Catholics; 1,749,206 (28.3
          per cent.) Protestants; 5,430 Old Catholics; 3,170 Mennonites;
          54,928 (.9 per cent.) Jews; and 4,142 of various faiths.

    Protestantism in Bavaria.

          The division of the chief confessions is based in great part on
          the historic conditions prevailing in 1624 and 1648, although
          the development of the cities has been the cause of many
          changes, the proportion of Protestants having increased in
          Munich and that of the Roman Catholics in Nuremberg. The old
          Bavarian circles of Upper and Lower Bavaria, as well as the
          Upper Palatinate, have always been essentially Roman Catholic.
          Upper Bavaria received its first Protestant citizens in the
          early part of the nineteenth century, but in consequence of the
          rapid growth of Munich in recent years the Protestants of that
          city alone numbered 78,000 in 1900. Six pastorates and six
          immovable vicariates are also contained in the district, and
          seven small churches have been built in market-towns and
          villages. Since the sixteenth century Lower Bavaria has posed
          the Protestant enclave of Ortenburg with certain neighboring
          places, while more recently communities have been established in
          the larger cities, especially Passau. The Upper Palatinate was
          not completely converted to Roman Catholicism in 1622-28, since
          the duchy of Sulzbach and the imperial city of Regensburg
          retained congregations of both confessions who used the same
          churches; but with the increase in population the proportion of
          Protestants steadily declined. The district now has four
          deaneries with forty-eight pastorates. In the three old Bavarian
          districts provision is made for the Protestant Diaspora by
          itinerant preachers, four of whom work in Upper Bavaria and two
          in Lower Bavaria and the Upper Palatinate combined. Since 1805
          Swabia has belonged in great part to Bavaria. It consisted
          originally of a group of territories belonging to free cities,
          the clergy, and knights of the empire. Only the first category
          was predominantly Protestant, and even here Roman Catholicism
          has gained steadily. Swabia contains the following Protestant
          deaneries: Augsburg, Ebermergen, Kempten (including Lindau and
          Kaufbeuren), Leipheim, Memmingen, Nördlingen, and Oettingen.

          Frankish North Bavaria is composed, on the one hand, of the
          episcopal territories of the bishoprics of Eichstätt, Bamberg,
          Würzburg, and a portion of the electorate of Mainz, and, on the
          other, of the Protestant principalities of Ansbach and Baireuth,
          Nuremberg, Rothenburg, and other free cities, and enclaves of
          the orders. This entire region is strongly Roman Catholic,
          although Lower Franconia has a considerable number of Protestant
          communities (116 pastorates, exclusive of Würzburg, Schweinfurt,
          and Aschaffenburg). In the larger section of Bavaria the
          historical divisions between Protestant and Roman Catholic, at
          least in the smaller towns, are still maintained, but in the
          minor portion, the Rhine Palatinate, there are few political
          communities which do not have a considerable minority of
          adherents of one or the other creed. In Speyer the proportions
          are almost equal, Roman Catholics numbering about 9,000 and the
          Protestants 8,000.

          The legal position of the Protestant Church in Bavaria is
          regulated by an edict of Sept. 8, 1809, while its foreign
          relations are governed by the constitution of 1818. Both
          Protestantism and Roman Catholicism are officially recognized,
          and controversies seldom arise between the two, except in regard
          to the creed in which children shall be brought up, methods of
          conversion, particularly in the Evangelical Diaspora, and the
          use of burial-grounds in Roman Catholic communities. In 1824 the
          official designation of the Protestants was declared to be
          "Protestant Church."

          The Reformed Church in the Palatinate first regained official
          recognition together with the Lutherans at the general
          consistory at Worms in 1815, and the Bavarian government created
          a consistory at Speyer on Dec. 15, 1818, for the "Protestant
          Churches of the Palatinate," a presbyterial and synodical
          constitution being introduced at the same time. In 1848 the
          Protestant Church of the Palatinate and the consistory of Speyer
          were placed directly under the jurisdiction of the ministry of
          state. The attempt to create a more definite confessional status
          led, in the sixth decade of the last century, to a victorious
          agitation on the part of the liberal element. Since 1879 the
          presbyteries have had the right to propose candidates for vacant
          pastorates. In Bavaria proper diocesan synods are held annually,
          and general synods every four years.

          There are few Protestants in Bavaria, except those who belong to
          the Evangelical Lutheran Church, nor are the professed adherents
          of sects numerous. A distinct organization was granted the
          Reformed in Bavaria proper in 1853, although they are still
          under the control of the Supreme Consistory. The Greek Church
          was recognized in 1826, but the Anglican Church is officially
          ignored like the Mennonites. The last-named have six communities
          in the Palatinate and four in Bavaria proper. Until 1887 the Old
          Catholics were reckoned as Roman Catholics, but are now declared
          to be a separate body, though full recognition has not been
          granted them.

    Roman Catholicism in Bavaria.

          The Roman Catholic Church in Bavaria is highly organized and
          extremely active, while its wealth and political influence are
          constantly increasing. The kingdom is divided into two
          archdioceses with eight dioceses. The archdiocese of
          Munich-Freising comprises the suffragan dioceses of Augsburg,
          Passau, and Regensburg; and the archdiocese of Bamberg includes
          the dioceses of Eichstätt, Würzburg, and Speyer. The education
          of the clergy, in agreement with the concordat of 1817, is
          entrusted to the bishops. The development of orders has been
          very rapid, especially in the sisterhoods for the education and
          the care of the sick. The number of cloisters has also increased
          rapidly, with a corresponding gain in real estate, and this
          development is aided by the generous gifts and foundations of
          the Roman Catholic population, the property of the 8,600
          institutions being valued at more than 150,000,000 marks; while
          that of the 1,800 Protestant institutions is worth only
          19,600,000 marks. The Roman Catholic clergy in Bavaria number
          some 4,900, or a proportion of one to 816 of the laity, while
          the Protestants have but about 1,300 clergymen, or one to 1,200
          laymen.

   Bavarians, Conversion of the

  BAVARIANS, CONVERSION OF THE.

          The origin of the race later known as the Bavarians is
          uncertain. The older hypothesis that they came of Celtic stock
          is now generally abandoned. For a time it was thought that they
          were a conglomerate of the remains of several tribes belonging
          to the Gothic family; but the view put forward by Zeuss (Die
          Herkunft der Bayern, Munich, 1857) that they are to be
          identified with the Marcomanni is now almost universally
          accepted, and has strong support in the facts.

    First Acquaintance with Christianity.

          The Marcomanni are first mentioned by Cæsar (Bel. Gal., i, 51).
          In his time they lived on the upper Main. Tacitus knows of them
          as inhabiting what is now Bohemia (Germ., xlii; cf. Annal., ii,
          26 sqq.). Here they maintained their position for centuries, and
          here they took the name of Baiowarii or Baioarii. During this
          period, Christianity found an entrance among them. Paulinus, in
          his life of Ambrose (xxxvi), tells of a queen of the Marcomanni
          named Fritigil who was converted by a wandering Italian
          Christian, and asked Ambrose for written instructions in the
          faith, which he gave in modum catechismi. The account goes on to
          say that she thereupon came to Milan, but found the bishop dead.
          As Ambrose died Apr. 4, 397, she must have crossed the Alps in
          the summer of that year. If the queen was a Christian, it is
          hardly likely that her religion would have been unknown to her
          people. That Arianism also reached the Marcomanni through Gothic
          influences is not improbable. However that may be, the bulk of
          the people were pagan when they settled in 488 on the strip of
          territory granted them by the Romans between the Lech and the
          Enns.

    Labors of Missionaries.

          The name of Bavarians is first applied in the Frankish list of
          tribes belonging to the first quarter of the sixth century. The
          territory which they occupied was no desolate wilderness. In the
          valleys and around the lakes there was a thin agricultural
          population which held to the Latin tongue and doubtless also to
          the Christian faith. Not all the cities were destroyed; Juvavum
          and Lauriacum lay in ruins; but neither Castra Batava nor Castra
          Regina was without inhabitants, and here also Christianity
          undoubtedly held its own with the Romanic population. Christians
          and heathens thus living as neighbors, a starting-point was
          afforded for missionary efforts. The ecclesiastical organization
          had, it is true, been broken up; only in southern Bavaria a
          bishopric founded in Roman times maintained its existence at
          Seben, and the diocese of Augsburg stretched over a part of the
          Bavarian territory. Under these circumstances the fact was of
          decisive importance that the Bavarians no sooner occupied their
          new home than they came into a position of dependence on the
          Frankish kingdom. The first ducal family, that of the
          Agilulfings, was of Frankish origin and professed Christianity,
          and the first outsiders who labored for the spread of the faith
          in Bavaria came from the Frankish kingdom. [5]Eustasius of
          Luxeuil (q.v.) the successor of Columban, worked there, and left
          missionaries trained by him when he returned to Burgundy. Later,
          Rupert, bishop of Worms, found a wide field here for his
          activity; [6]Emmeram and [7]Corbinian (qq.v.) were Franks. Side
          by side with them there seem to have been at a very early period
          some Scoto-Irish monks, but there is no record of their labors.
          The result of the combined operation of these imperfectly known
          factors was the acceptance of Christianity by the Bavarian race
          as a whole, which was completed in the course of the seventh
          century. It is a remarkable fact that it was not accompanied by
          the organization of a local episcopate; as far as can be told
          the direction of ecclesiastical affairs was in the hands of the
          dukes; it is Theodo who invites Rupert thither, and who treats
          with the pope in regard to church institutions. From this fact
          it would appear that the Christian profession of the dukes
          played a decisive part in the conversion of the people at large.
          The existence of the Church without diocesan bishops was made
          possible by the fact that the wandering monks and missionaries
          were frequently in episcopal orders, and could thus perform the
          strictly episcopal functions.

    Organization of Bishoprics.

          The above-mentioned Duke Theodo, acting in concert with the
          pope, endeavored to introduce a more regular organization. With
          this end in view, he visited Rome in 716, and had an agreement
          with Pope Gregory II as to the measures to be taken. At least
          four dioceses were to be founded corresponding to the divisions
          of the secular jurisdiction. The bishop of the most important
          place was to be set as metropolitan at the head of the Bavarian
          Church, the pope reserving the right to consecrate him, and if
          necessary to name an Italian. Order was to be brought into the
          ecclesiastical affairs by a general visitation; the Roman use
          was to be taken as the model in liturgical matters. But these
          plans were never carried into execution, apparently by reason of
          the death of Theodo. The organization of the Bavarian
          bishoprics, involving the termination of the missionary period,
          was only accomplished by [8]Boniface, (q.v.) who paid a short
          visit to the country in 719, and returned in 735 or 736 to make
          a formal visitation by virtue of what was practically a
          metropolitan jurisdiction over the whole of Germany, for the
          purpose of acquiring full information as to the prevailing
          conditions. His definite organizing work is introduced by a
          brief (738 or 739) from Gregory III to the bishops of Bavaria
          and Alemannia, enjoining them to receive Boniface with fitting
          honors as his representative, and to attend a synod to be held
          by him. In 739 Boniface undertook the settlement of diocesan
          boundaries and institutions, and provided three of the four
          bishoprics of Bavaria with bishops consecrated by
          himself--Erembrecht, brother of Corbinian, at Freising, Gavibald
          at Regensburg, and John, a newcomer from England, at
          Salzburg--while Vivilo, who had been consecrated by the pope,
          remained at Passau. Gregory III confirmed these arrangements on
          Oct. 29, and the subordinate divisions of archdeaconries and
          parishes were soon organized. The decisions of the Synod of
          Reisbach (799) show the parochial system in full operation.

   Baxter, Richard
          BAXTER, RICHARD: One of the greatest of English theologians; b.
          at Rowton (42 m. n.e. of Shrewsbury), Shropshire, Nov. 12, 1615;
          d. in London Dec. 8, 1691. Though without a university
          education, and always sickly, he acquired great learning.

    Ministry at Kidderminster.

          In 1633 he had a brief experience of court life at Whitehall
          (London), but turned from the court in disgust and studied
          theology. In 1638 he was ordained by the bishop of Worcester and
          preached in various places till 1641, when he began his ministry
          at Kidderminster (18 m. s.w. of Birmingham), as "teacher." There
          he labored with wonderful success so that the place was utterly
          transformed. When the Civil War broke out (1642) he retired
          temporarily to Gloucester and then to Coventry because he sided
          with the parliament, while all in and about Kidderminster sided
          with the king. He was, however, no blind partizan and boldly
          spoke out for moderation and fairness. After acting as an army
          chaplain he separated from the army, partly on account of
          illness, and returned to Kidderminster.

    In London.

          In the spring of 1660 he left Kidderminster and went to London.
          He preached before the House of Commons at St. Margaret's,
          Westminster, Apr. 30, 1660, and before the lord mayor and
          aldermen at St. Paul's, May 10, and was among those to give
          Charles II welcome to his kingdom. Charles made him one of his
          chaplains and offered him the bishopric of Hereford, which he
          declined. He was a leader on the Non-conformist side in the
          Savoy Conference (1661) and presented a revision of the
          Prayer-book which could be used by the Non-conformists. He also
          preached frequently in different pulpits. Seeing how things were
          going, he desired permission to return to Kidderminster as
          curate, but was refused. On May 16, 1662, three days before the
          Act of Uniformity was passed, he took formal farewell of the
          Church of England and retired to Acton, a west suburb of London.
          From this time on he had no regular charge and until the
          accession of William and Mary in 1688 he suffered, like other
          Non-conformist preachers, from repressive laws often rigorously
          and harshly enforced. On Sept. 10, 1662, he married Margaret,
          daughter of Francis Charlton, of Shropshire, twenty-four years
          his junior, who possessed wealth and social position, and made
          him a devoted helpmeet, cheerfully going with him into exile and
          prison and spending her money lavishly in the relief of their
          less fortunate fellow sufferers. She died June 14, 1681, and
          Baxter has perpetuated her memory in a singularly artless but
          engaging memoir (London, 1681).

    Imprisonment.

          During all these years on the verge of trouble because he
          persisted in preaching, he was actually imprisoned only twice,
          once for a short period, and again from Feb. 28, 1685, to Nov.
          24, 1686. The judge who condemned him the second time was George
          Jeffreys, who treated him with characteristic brutality. The
          charge was that in his Paraphrase of the New Testament (1685)
          Baxter had libeled the Church of England. But insult, heavy and
          indeed ruinous fines, enforced wanderings, anxiety as to
          personal safety, and imprisonment had no power to daunt Baxter's
          spirit. He preached constantly to great multitudes, and
          addressed through his writings a still vaster throng. The
          Toleration Act of 1688 ended his sufferings and he died in
          peace.

    Writings.

          Baxter was one of the most voluminous of English authors, and
          one of the best. But there is no complete edition of his 108
          treatises, only of his practical works. A few of his works are
          in verse (Poetical Fragments, reprinted, London, 1821), though
          he has small claim to be called a poet, and one familiar hymn
          ("Lord, it belongs not to my care") has been manufactured out of
          a longer one of his. The after-world knows him by reputation as
          the author of The Reformed Pastor (1656), a treatise on pastoral
          theology still usable; A Call to the Unconverted to turn and
          live and accept of mercy while mercy may be had, as even they
          would find mercy in the day of their extremity; from the Living
          God (1657), uttered as a dying man to dying men and impressive
          to-day; but chiefly because of The Saints' Everlasting Rest: or
          a treatise of the blessed state of the Saints in their enjoyment
          of God in glory. Wherein is shewed its excellency and certainty;
          the misery of those that lose it, the way to attain it, and
          assurance of it; and how to live in the continual delightful
          foretaste of it, by the help of meditation. Written by the
          author for his own use, in the time of his languishing, when God
          took him off from all publike imployment; and afterwards
          preached in his weekly lecture (1650). The "Saints' Rest" gained
          a reputation it has never lost, but the 648 pages of the
          original edition have proved too many for posterity and the work
          is read nowadays, if at all, only in an abridgment of an
          abridgment. The best brief characterization of this faithful,
          fearless, and gifted religious teacher is on his monument at
          Kidderminster, erected by Churchmen and Non-conformists, and
          unveiled July 28, 1875: "Between the years 1641 and 1660 this
          town was the scene of the labours of Richard Baxter, renowned
          equally for his Christian learning and his pastoral fidelity. In
          a stormy and divided age he advocated unity and comprehension,
          pointing the way to everlasting rest." In many respects Baxter
          was a modern man.

    His Theology.

          Baxter's theology was set forth most elaborately in his Latin
          Methodus theologiæ Chriatianæ (London, 1681); the Christian
          Directory (1673) contains the practical part of his system; and
          Catholic Theology (1675) is an English exposition. His theology
          made Baxter very unpopular among his contemporaries and caused a
          split among the Dissenters of the eighteenth century. As
          summarized by Thomas W. Jenkyn, it differed from the Calvinism
          of Baxter's day on four points: (1) The atonement of Christ did
          not consist in his suffering the identical but the equivalent
          punishment (i.e., one which would have the same effect in moral
          government) as that deserved by mankind because of offended law.
          Christ died for sins, not persons. While the benefits of
          substitutionary atonement are accessible and available to all
          men for their salvation; they have in the divine appointment a
          special reference to the subjects of personal elation. (2) The
          elect were a certain fixed number determined by the decree
          without any reference to their faith as the ground of their
          election; which decree contemplates no reprobation but rather
          the redemption of all who will accept Christ as their Savior.
          (3) What is imputed to the sinner in the work of justification
          is not the righteousness of Christ but the faith of the sinner
          himself in the righteousness of Christ. (4) Every sinner has a
          distinct agency of his own to exert in the process of his
          conversion. The Baxterian theory, with modifications, was
          adopted by many later Presbyterians and Congregationalists in
          England, Scotland, and America (Isaac Watts, Philip Doddridge,
          and many others).

   Bayle, Pierre
          BAYLE, bêl, PIERRE: French Protestant; b. at Carla (11 m. w. of
          Pamiers), department of Ariège, Nov. 18, 1647; d. at Rotterdam
          Dec. 28, 1706. He was the son of a Calvinist clergyman, and, in
          1666, began his studies at the Protestant Academy at Puylaurens,
          whence he went to the University of Toulouse in 1669. Not
          satisfied with the objections of the Reformed against the dogma
          of a divinely appointed judge in matters of faith, he became a
          Roman Catholic. He spent eighteen months at the Jesuits' College
          in Toulouse, and then returned to Protestantism and went to
          Geneva (1670), where, living as a tutor in private families, he
          studied theology as well as the Cartesian philosophy. His
          friendship with Jacques Basnage and Minutoli began there. Later
          he accompanied pupils to Rouen and in 1675 to Paris. Then he
          spent several years as a lecturer on philosophy at Sédan; when
          that academy was closed by order of the king (1681), he accepted
          an appointment as lecturer on philosophy at the "École illustre"
          of Rotterdam. In this refuge of liberty, Bayle wrote most of his
          works. The revocation of the Edict of Nantes raised his
          indignation, and several of the best Protestant works called
          forth by that disgraceful piece of policy proceeded from the pen
          of Bayle. The conclusion at which he arrives by his close
          reasoning is: that matters of belief should be outside the
          sphere of the State as such--a dangerous principle for
          Catholicism, and the book was at once put on the Index. Even
          among Protestants Bayle had adversaries. Jurieu, his jealous and
          violent opponent at Rotterdam, considered toleration equal to
          indifference, and reproached Bayle with dangerous skepticism,
          which made his position very difficult. He tried for an
          appointment in Berlin. But the realization of this wish was
          prevented by the death of the great Elector Frederick William.
          Jurieu continued his attacks and even went so far as to
          represent Bayle as the head of a party working into the hands of
          Louis XIV by aiming at a split between the princes allied
          against France. William III gave credence to this and influenced
          the magistrate of Rotterdam to remove Bayle from his position
          (1693). From that time he lived for his literary work, chiefly
          bearing on philosophy and the history of literature. His
          Dictionnaire historique et critique [(2 vols. in three parts
          Rotterdam, 1697; 2d ed., 3 vols., 1702; 11th ed., 16 vols.,
          Paris, 1820-24; Eng. transl., 5 vols., London, 1734-38)] was
          mast favorably received by all the learned men of Europe, though
          it brought on him a revival of the reproach of skepticism, of
          want of respect for the Holy Scriptures, even of Manicheism.
          Called to justify himself before a commission appointed by the
          presbytery of Rotterdam, he was treated with great moderation,
          and consented to change some of the offensive articles, which
          appeared in their new form in the second edition of his
          Dictionnaire. Accusations against him came up again from time to
          time, and he tried to refute them in minor philosophical works.
          Besides the Dictionnaire his works include: Lettres à M. L. D.
          A. C., docteur en Sorbonne, où il est prouvé que les comètes ne
          sont point le présage d'aucun malheur (Cologne, 1682); Critique
          générale de l'Histoire du Calvinisme de M. Maimbourg (Amsterdam,

          BAYLEY, JAMES ROOSEVELT: Roman Catholic archbishop of Baltimore;
          b. at Rye, N. Y., Aug. 23, 1814; d. in Newark, N. J., Oct. 3,
          1877. He was a nephew of Elizabeth (Bayley) Seton ("Mother
          Seton"), founder of the order of Sisters of Charity in America;
          was graduated at Washington (Trinity) College, Hartford, Conn.,
          1835; rector of St. Peter's church, Harlem, New York, 1840-41;
          received into the Roman Catholic Church at Rome, 1842; studied
          in Paris and Rome, and was ordained priest in New York, 1843;
          was professor in St. John's College, Fordham, New York, and its
          acting president, 1845-46; became secretary to Bishop Hughes of
          New York, 1846, bishop of Newark, 1853, archbishop of Baltimore
          and primate of America, 1872. He published a volume of pastoral
          letters; Sketch of the History of the Catholic Church on the
          Island of New York (New York, 1853); Memoirs of Simon Gabriel
          Bruté, First Bishop of Vincennes (1861).

   Bayly, Lewis
          BAYLY, LEWIS: Anglican bishop; b. perhaps at Carmarthen, Wales,
          perhaps at Lamington (6 m. s.w. of Bigger), Scotland, year
          unknown; d, at Bangor, Wales, Oct. 26, 1631. He was educated at
          Oxford; became vicar of Evesham, Worcestershire, and in 1604,
          probably, rector of St. Matthew's, Friday street, London; was
          then chaplain to Henry Prince of Wales (d. 1612), later chaplain
          to King James I, who, in 1616, appointed him bishop of Bangor.
          He was an ardent Puritan. His fame rests on The Practice of
          Piety, directing a Christian how to walk that he may please God
          (date of first ed. unknown; 3d ed., London, 1613). It reached
          its 74th edition in 1821 and has been translated into French,
          German, Italian, Polish, Romansch, Welsh, and into the language
          of the Massachusetts Indians. It was one of the two books which
          John Bunyan's wife brought with her--the other one being Arthur
          Dent's Plain Man's Pathway to Heaven--and it was by reading it
          that Bunyan was first spiritually awakened.

          BAY PSALM BOOK: A metrical translation of the Psalms, published
          by Stephen Daye at Cambridge, Mass., in 1640 and the first book
          printed in America. The work of translation was begun in 1636,
          the principal collaborators being Thomas Welde, Richard Mather,
          and John Eliot, the missionary to the Indians. The rendering, as
          the translators themselves recognized in their quaint preface to
          the book, was a crude specimen of English, and carrying to the
          extreme their belief in the inspiration of the Bible, they
          tortured their version into what they conceived to be fidelity
          to the original. The meter, moreover, is irregular, and the
          rimes are frequently ludicrous. The general spirit and form of
          the translation may be represented by the following rendering of
          Ps. xviii, 6-9:

          6. "I in my streights, cal'd on the Lord,

          and to my God cry'd: he did heare

          from his temple my voyce, my crye,

          before him came, unto his eare.

          7. "Then th' earth shooke, do quak't, do moutaines

          roots mov'd, & were stird at his ire,

          8. "Vp from his nostrils went a smoak,

          and from his mouth devouring fire;

          By it the coales inkindled were.

          9. "Likewise the heavens he downe-bow'd,

          And he descended, & there was

          under his feet a gloomy cloud."

          Of the first edition of the Bay Psalm Book only eleven copies
          are known to exist. In 1647 a second edition, better printed and
          with the spelling and punctuation corrected, was published
          either by Stephen Daye or possibly by Matthew Daye or even in
          England, and this edition long remained in general use among the
          Puritans of New England. A reprint of the first edition (71
          copies) was issued privately at Cambridge in 1862.

   Bdellium
          BDELLIUM, del´i-Um (Hebr. bedhola?): One of the products of the
          land of Havilah, mentioned with gold and the shoham-stone (E. V.
          "onyx") in Gen. ii, 11-12. In Num. xi, 7, manna is said to have
          resembled it. It was, therefore, something well known to the
          Hebrews, but the exact meaning is uncertain. Some have thought
          that it was a precious stone, perhaps the pearl; others identify
          it with myrrh or with musk. The most probable and generally
          accepted explanation is that it was the gum of a tree, much
          prized in antiquity and used in religious ceremonies. Pliny
          (Hist. nat., xii, 35) describes it as transparent, waxy,
          fragrant, oily to the touch, and bitter; the tree was black, of
          the size of the olive; with leaves like the ilex, and fruit like
          the wild fig; he designates Bactria as its home, but states that
          it grew also in Arabia, India, Media, and Babylonia. It probably
          belonged to the balsamodendra and was allied to the myrrh.

   Beardslee, Clark Smith
          BEARDSLEE, CLARK SMITH: Congregationalist; b. at Coventry,
          N. Y., Feb. 1, 1850. He was educated at Amherst College (B.A.,
          1876), Hartford Theological Seminary (1879), and the University

          of Truth (Hartford, 1905).

   Beatification
          BEATIFICATION: An intermediate stage in the process of
          canonization. It is in modern usage itself the result of a
          lengthy course of inquiry into the life of the person under
          consideration, and is solemnly declared in St. Peter's at Rome.
          By it the title of "Blessed" is attributed to the subject, and a
          limited and partial cultus of him permitted, as in a certain
          country or order. See [9]Canonization.

   Beatific Vision
          BEATIFIC VISION: The direct and unhindered vision of God, which
          is part of the reserved blessedness of the redeemed (I Cor.
          xiii, 12; I John iii, 2; Rev. xxii, 3, 4). The conception of its
          nature must necessarily be very vague, but belief in its
          existence is said to be founded upon Scripture and reason. The
          only question concerns its time. This has been much disputed.
          The Greek Church and many Protestants, especially Lutherans and
          Calvinists, put the vision after the judgment day (so Dr. Hodge,
          Systematic Theology, iii, 860). According to the view prevalent
          among Roman Catholic theologians, the vision, though essentially
          complete before the resurrection, is not integrally so until the
          soul is reunited to the glorified body (consult H. Hurter,
          Theologiæ dogmaticæ compendium, vol. iii, De Deo consummatore,
          chap. v, 10th ed., Innsbruck, 1900).

   Beaton (Bethune), David
          BEATON, bî´ten (BETHUNE), be-thun´ or be-tün´, DAVID:
          Cardinal-archbishop of St. Andrews; b. 1494; assassinated at St.
          Andrews May 29,1546. He was the third son of John Beacon of
          Auchmuty, Fifeshire; studied at the universities of St. Andrews
          and Glasgow, and at the age of fifteen went to Paris and studied
          law; became abbot of Arbroath in 1523; bishop of Mirepoix in
          Languedoc 1537; cardinal Dec., 1538. He was made lord privy seal
          in 1528; succeeded his uncle, James Beaton, as archbishop of St.
          Andrews in 1539; was consecrated archbishop of Glasgow at Rome
          in 1552; became chancellor and prothonotary apostolic and legate
          a latere in 1543. He served his country in many important
          diplomatic missions. In the bitter political contests of the
          time between the French and English parties he sided with the
          former, and fought with energy and courage for the independence
          of Scotland against the plans of Henry VIII. In the religious
          contests between Romanists and Reformers he took as decidedly
          the part of the hierarchy and did not scruple to use intrigue
          and force when argument and persuasion failed. His memory has
          been darkened by his severity against heretics and his immoral
          life. The case of [10]George Wishart is adduced as a
          particularly flagrant piece of religious persecution; but it
          must be remembered that he lived in a rude country in turbulent
          times, and the Reformers were implicated in political intrigues
          and treasonable plots. The execution of Wishart was the
          immediate cause of a conspiracy to put Beaton out of the way,
          and certain members of the Reform party murdered him in his
          bedchamber.

   Beattie, Francis Robert
          BEATTIE, FRANCIS ROBERT: Presbyterian; b. at Guelph, Ont., Mar.
          31, 1848; d. at Louisville, Ky., Sept. 4, 1906. He was educated
          at the University of Toronto (B.A., 1875), Knox Theological
          College, Toronto (1878), Illinois Wesleyan University (Ph.D.,
          1884), and Presbyterian Theological College, Montreal (D.D.,
          1887). He was tutor in Knox College in 1876-78, and held
          Canadian pastorates at Baltimore and Coldsprings (1878-82) and
          Brantford (1882-88), in addition to being examiner to Toronto
          University in 1884-1888. In the latter year he entered the
          Presbyterian Church, South, and was appointed professor of
          apologetics in Columbia Seminary, Columbia, S. C., remaining
          there until 1893, when he became professor of apologetics and
          systematic theology in the Presbyterian Theological Seminary of
          Kentucky at Louisville. He published Utilitarian Theory of
          Morals (Brantford, Ont., 1884); Methods of Theism (1887);
          Radical Criticism (Chicago, 1894); Presbyterian Standards
          (Richmond, Va., 1896); and Apologetics (vol. i, 1903). He also
          edited the Memorial Volume of the Westminster Assembly
          Celebration at Charlotte, N. C. (Richmond, Va., 1897), and was
          associate editor of the Christian Observer from 1893 and of The
          Presbyterian Quarterly from 1895.

   Beattie, James
          BEATTIE, JAMES: Scotch poet; b. at Laurencekirk (70 m. n.n.e. of
          Edinburgh), Kincardineshire, Oct. 25, 1735; d. at Aberdeen Aug.
          18, 1803. He studied at the Marischal College, Aberdeen (M.A.,
          1753), and, after seven years as a school-teacher, became
          professor of moral philosophy and logic at that institution in
          1760. In reply to Hume he wrote An Essay on the Nature and
          Immutability of Truth (London, 1770), which was popular and
          successful, but has little value as a philosophical work. Other
          works of his were: Dissertations, Moral and Critical (1783);
          Evidences of the Christian Religion (2 vols., Edinburgh, 1786);
          and Elements of Moral Science (2 vols., 1790-93). His poems, of
          which the chief is The Minstrel (books i-ii, 1771-1774), are
          much better than his philosophical writings; and it is for them
          that he is remembered.

   Beausobre, Isaac de
          BEAUSOBRE, bO´´sO´br, ISAAC DE: One of the most distinguished
          preachers of the French Protestant Church; b. at Niort (220 m.
          s.w. of Paris), in the present department of Deux-Sèvres, Mar.
          8, 1659; d. in Berlin June 5, 1738. He was descended from a
          Protestant family of Gascogne, whose head took refuge in Geneva
          in 1578. He began his theological studies at the celebrated
          academy of Saumur, was ordained at the last synod of Loudun, and
          was called to be minister of the church at Chatillon, department
          of Indre, 1683. During the religious persecution, he fled in
          Nov., 1685, to Rotterdam, where he was welcomed at the house of
          the princess of Orange and, through her, was appointed chaplain
          to her daughter, princess of Anhalt-Dessau. In 1694 he was
          appointed chaplain to the elector of Brandenburg, Frederick III,
          and was called to Berlin as minister of the French Church. He
          stayed there for thirty-six years, preaching with much success,
          and was loaded with favors by King Frederick II. Among other
          honorable missions, he was sent in 1704 to the Duke of
          Marlborough, and, in 1713, to the commissioners of the Treaty of
          Utrecht, to ask for the exchange of Huguenot galley-slaves for
          French prisoners. He was privy councilor of the king of Prussia,
          director of the French House and of the French schools, and
          superintendent of all the French churches in Berlin.

          His works are: Défense de la doctrine des Réformés sur la

   Bebenburg, Lupold Von
          BEBENBURG, LUPOLD VON: Bishop of Bamberg, best known for his
          writings on ecclesiastico-political subjects; d. 1363. He came
          of a knightly Frankish family, and studied canon law at Bologna.
          From 1338 to 1352 he was a member of the chapters of W?rzburg
          and Mainz and dean of St. Severus at Erfurt. In 1353 he was made
          bishop of Bamberg, and remained there till his death. In the
          struggle between Louis the Bavarian and Popes John XXII,
          Benedict XII, and Clement VI, he was among the jurists who took
          the emperor's side. His treatise De juribus regni et imperii
          Romanorum (ed. J. Wimpfeling, Strasburg, 1508; S. Schard, in De
          jurisdictione, auctoritate, et præeminentia imperiali ac
          potestate ecclesiastica variis auctoribus scripta, Basel, 1566,
          and often), dedicated to Louis' supporter, the elector Baldwin
          of Treves, deals less with abstract ideas and Aristotelian
          politics than with historical considerations. Two minor works of
          his have also been preserved, one in praise of the devotion of
          the old German princes to the Church (in Schard, ut sup.), the
          other a lament over the condition of the Holy Roman Empire (ed.
          Peter, Würzburg, 1842).

   Bec, Abbey of
          BEC, ABBEY OF: Benedictine abbey of Normandy, situated at the
          present village of Le BecHellouin (7 m. s.w. of Rouen). It was
          founded about 1034 by Herluin, a noble Norman, who was first
          abbot. Mainly because of its great teachers, Lanfranc (who came
          to the abbey about 1042 and was prior 1045 or 1046-66) and
          Anselm (entered the abbey 1060; prior 1063-78; abbot 1078-93;
          see [11]Anselm, Saint, of Canterbury), it became a famous center
          of learning for Normandy and, after the Conquest, for England.
          Among those who studied there were: Anselm of Lucca, afterward
          Pope Alexander II; Anselm of Laon; Gilbert Crispin, abbot of
          Westminster, author of the life of Herluin; Milo Crispin,
          biographer of Lanfranc and certain of the early abbots; Arnulf
          and Gundulf, bishops of Rochester; Ivo of Chartres; Gutmund,
          archbishop of Aversa; and William, archbishop of Rouen. Its
          fifth abbot, Theobald, became archbishop of Canterbury (1139);
          and the seventh abbot was Vacarius, who about the middle of the
          twelfth century introduced the study of the Roman law into
          England. The abbey was destroyed during the French Revolution.

          BECAN (VERBEECK, VAN DER BEECK), MARTIN: Jesuit; b. at
          Hilvarenbeeck (35 m. n.e. of Antwerp), in Brabant, Jan. 6, 1563;
          d. in Vienna Jan. 24, 1624. He joined the Jesuits in 1583;
          taught philosophy and theology at schools of the order in
          Cologne, Würzburg, Mainz, and Vienna; and became confessor to
          the emperor Ferdinand II in 1620. He engaged in controversy with
          Lutherans, Calvinists and Anabaptists, and in particular
          attacked the Church of England. In his Controversia Anglicana de
          Potestate pontificis et regis (Mainz, 1613) he defended the
          morality of assassinating a heretic king; and in Quæstiones de
          fide hæreticis servanda (1609) he declared that no promise or
          oath given to a heretic was binding. The former work was
          condemned at Rome. His collected works were published in two
          volumes at Mainz, 1630-31.

          s.s.w. of Stuttgart), Württemberg, Feb. 22, 1804; d. at Tübingen
          Dec. 28, 1878. He studied at Tübingen 1822-26, was pastor at
          Waldthann and Mergentheim, went to Basel as extraordinary
          professor in 1838, and in 1843 to Tübingen, where he remained as
          professor and morning preacher till his death. He has been
          characterized as the most important representative of the
          strictly Biblical school of theology in the nineteenth century.
          He aimed to base all doctrine on the Bible, and allowed value to
          Church teachings only as interpretations of the Bible. He held
          an extreme view of revelation and inspiration, and hardly
          entered into critico-historical questions. His life was plain
          and simple, and his kind heart won general affection. He
          published, besides several collections of sermons, the following
          works: Einleitung in das System der christlichen Lehre
          (Stuttgart, 1838, 2d ed., 1870); Die Geburt des christlichen

   Becket, Thomas
          BECKET, THOMAS (commonly called Thomas à Becket): Archbishop of
          Canterbury 1162-70, the most determined English champion of the
          rights and liberties of the Church in his day; b. in London
          between 1110 and 1120; assassinated at Canterbury Dec. 29, 1170.

    Life before his Consecration.

          His parents were of the middle class. He received an excellent
          education, which he completed at the University of Paris.
          Returning to England, he attracted the notice of Theobald,
          archbishop of Canterbury, who entrusted him with several
          important missions to Rome, and finally made him archdeacon of
          Canterbury and provost of Beverley. He so distinguished himself
          by his zeal and efficiency that Theobald commended him to King
          Henry II when the important office of chancellor was vacant.
          Henry, like all the Norman kings, desired to be absolute master
          of his dominions, in both Church and State, and could well
          appeal to the traditions of his house when he planned to do away
          with the special privileges of the English clergy, which he
          regarded as so many fetters on his authority. Becket struck him
          as an instrument well adapted for the accomplishment of his
          designs; the young man showed himself an accomplished courtier,
          a cheerful companion in the king's pleasures, and devoted to his
          master's interests with such a firm and yet diplomatic
          thoroughness that scarcely any one, unless perhaps it was John
          of Salisbury, could have doubted that he had gone over
          completely to the royal side. Archbishop Theobald died Apr. 18,
          1161, and the chapter learned with some indignation that the
          king expected them to choose Thomas his successor. The election
          was, however, consummated in May, and Thomas was consecrated on
          June 3, 1162.

    Archbishop, 1162.

          At once there took place before the eyes of the astonished king
          and country an unexpected transformation in the character of the
          new primate. Instead of a gay, pleasure-loving courtier, he
          stood forth an ascetic prelate in simple monastic garb, ready to
          contend to the uttermost for the cruse of the hierarchy. In the
          schism which at that time divided the Church, he declared for
          [12]Alexander III, a man whose devotion to the same strict
          hierarchical principles appealed to him; and from Alexander he
          received the pallium at the Council of Tours. On his return to
          England, he proceeded at once to put into execution the project
          he had formed for the liberation of the Church of England from
          the very limitations which he had formerly helped to enforce.
          His aim was twofold: the complete exemption of the Church from
          all civil jurisdiction, with undivided control of the clergy,
          freedom of appeal, etc., and the acquisition and security of as
          independent fund of church property. The king was not slow to
          perceive the inevitable outcome of the archbishop's attitude,
          and called a meeting of the clergy at Westminster (Oct. 1, 1163)
          at which he demanded that they should renounce all claim to
          exemption from civil jurisdiction and acknowledge the equality
          of all subjects before the law. The others were inclined to
          yield, but the archbishop stood firm. Henry was not ready for an
          open breach, and offered to be content with a more general
          acknowledgment and recognition of the "customs of his
          ancestors." Thomas was willing to agree to this, with the
          significant reservation "saving the rights of the Church." But
          this involved the whole question at issue, and Henry left London
          in anger.

    The Constitutions of Clarendon.

          Henry called another assembly at Clarendon for Jan. 30, 1164, at
          which he presented his demands in sixteen constitutions. What he
          asked involved the abandonment of the clergy's independence and
          of their direct connection with Rome; he employed all his arts
          to induce their consent, and was apparently successful with all
          but the primate. Finally even Becket expressed his willingness
          to agree to the constitutions; but when it came to the actual
          signature he definitely refused. This meant war between the two
          powers. Henry endeavored to rid himself of his antagonist by
          judicial process and summoned him to appear before a great
          council at Northampton on Oct. 8, 1164, to answer charges of
          contempt of royal authority and maladministration of the
          chancellor's office.

    Becket Leaves England.

          Becket denied the right of the assembly to judge him, appealed
          to the pope, and, feeling that his life was too valuable to the
          Church to be risked, went into voluntary exile on Nov. 2,
          embarking in a fishing-boat which landed him in France. He went
          to Sens, where Pope Alexander was, while envoys from the king
          hastened to work against him, requesting that a legate should be
          sent to England with plenary authority to settle the dispute.
          Alexander declined, and when, the next day, Becket arrived and
          gave him a full account of the proceedings, he was still more
          confirmed in his aversion to the king. Henry pursued the
          fugitive archbishop with a series of edicts, aimed at all his
          friends and supporters as well as himself; but Louis VII of
          France received him with respect and offered him protection. He
          spent newly two years in the Cistercian abbey of Pontigny, until
          Henry's threats against the order obliged him to move to Sens
          again. He regarded himself as in full possession of all his
          prerogatives, and desired to see his position enforced by the
          weapons of excommunication and interdict. But Alexander, though
          sympathizing with him in theory, was for a milder and more
          diplomatic way of reaching his ends. Differences thus arose
          between pope and archbishop, which were all the more embittered
          when legates were sent in 1167 with authority to act as
          arbitrators. Disregarding this limitation of his jurisdiction,
          and steadfast in his principles, Thomas treated with the legates
          at great length, still conditioning his obedience to the king by
          the rights of his order. His firmness seemed about to meet with
          its reward when at last (1170) the pope was on the point of
          fulfilling his threats and excommunicating the king, and Henry,
          alarmed by the prospect, held out hopes of an agreement which
          should allow Thomas to return to England and resume his place.
          But both parties were really still holding to their former
          ground, and the desire for a reconciliation was only apparent.
          Both, however, seem for the moment to have believed in its
          possibility; and the contrast was all the sharper when it became
          evident that the old irreconcilable opposition was still there.
          Henry, incited by his partizans, refused to restore the
          ecclesiastical property which he had seized, and Thomas prepared
          to issue the pope's sentence against the despoilers of the
          Church and the bishops who had abetted them. It had been already
          sent to England for promulgation when he himself landed at
          Sandwich on Dec. 3, 1170, and two days later entered Canterbury.

    Becket Assassinated.

          The tension was now too great to be endured, and the catastrophe
          which relieved it was not long in coming. A passionate word of
          the angry king was taken as authority by four knights, who
          immediately plotted the murder of the archbishop, and
          accomplished it in his own cathedral on Dec. 29. The crime
          brought its own revenge. Becket was revered by the faithful
          throughout Europe as a martyr, and canonized by Alexander in
          1173; while on July 12 of the following year Henry humbled
          himself to do public penance at the tomb of his enemy, which
          remained one of the most popular places of pilgrimage in England
          until it was destroyed at the Reformation (see [13]Canterbury).

          advanced to the priesthood in the same year, and was rector of
          St. Luke's, Atlanta, Ga. (1881-86), Christ Church, Houston, Tex.
          (1886-92), and Trinity, Galveston, Tex. (1892-1902). In 1902 he

          Brewer, Me., in 1877, of the South Evangelical Congregational
          Church, West Roxbury, Mass., in 1882, professor of Christian
          theology at Bangor Theological Seminary in 1892, and professor
          of systematic theology at Chicago Theological Seminary in 1905.
          He holds that "the realities of the Christian religion and the
          facts of Christian experience which we share with Christians of
          all ages are to be interpreted by us in terms of modern
          thought." He has written Realities of Christian Theology (New
          York, 1906).

   Beckx, Pierre Jean
          BECKX, PIERRE JEAN: General of the Jesuits; b. at Sichem (33 m.
          s.e. of Antwerp) Feb. 8, 1795; d. at Rome Mar. 4, 1887. He
          entered the Society of Jesus at Hildesheim in 1819, and was
          professed in 1830. He was active as a pastor at Hamburg,
          Hildesheim, and Brunswick, and in 1826 was stationed at Köthen
          as the confessor of the newly converted duke and duchess of
          Anhalt-Köthen. From 1830 to 1848 he was in Vienna, where he
          exercised much influence, especially over Metternich, and was
          made procurator of the Society of Jesus in that country in 1847;
          when his Order was expelled from Austria in 1848, he was
          appointed rector of the University of Louvain. Four years later,
          however, the Jesuits were readmitted to Austria, largely through
          his unceasing activity, and in 1852 he returned to Vienna as
          provincial of the Society. In the following year he was elected
          general, and held this office until 1883, when, on account of
          his advancing years, the vicar-general Antoine M. Anderledy was
          appointed to assist him. In the following year Beckx resigned
          the generalship in favor of Anderledy. The successful fortunes
          of the Jesuits during the attacks upon them both in Austria and
          Germany were due in great part to his ability and tact, and in
          his administration the numbers of the Society were almost
          doubled. He was the founder and editor of the famous Civiltà
          Cattolica, and also wrote the anonymous Der Monat Mariä (Vienna,
          1838; Eng. transl. by Mrs. Edward Hazeland, London, 1884).

   Bede
          BEDE or BÆDA (called "the Venerable"): The first great English
          scholar; b. in Northumbria (according to tradition, at Monkton,
          Durham, 5 m. e. of Newcastle) 672 or 673; d. at the monastery of
          Jarrow (6 m. e. of Newcastle) May 25, 735. Almost all that is
          known of his life is contained in a notice added by himself to
          his Historia ecclesiastica (v, 24), which states that he was
          placed in the monastery at Wearmouth at the age of seven, that
          he became deacon in his nineteenth year, and priest in his
          thirtieth. He was trained by the abbots [14]Benedict Biscop and
          [15]Ceolfrid, and probably accompanied the latter to Jarrow in
          682. There he spent his life, finding his chief pleasure in
          being always occupied in learning, teaching, or writing, and
          zealous in the performance of monastic duties. His works show
          that he had at his command all the learning of his time. He was
          proficient in patristic literature, and quotes from Puny the
          Younger, Vergil, Lucretius, Ovid, Horace, and other classical
          writers, but with some disapproval. He knew Greek and a little
          Hebrew. His Latin is clear and without affectation, and he is a
          skilful story-teller. Like all men of his time he was devoted to
          the allegorical method of interpretation, and was credulous
          concerning the miraculous; but in most things his good sense is
          conspicuous, and his kindly and broad sympathies, his love of
          truth and fairness, his unfeigned piety, and his devotion to the
          service of others combine to make him an exceedingly attractive
          character. His works were so widely spread throughout Europe and
          so much esteemed that he won the name of "the teacher of the
          Middle Ages."

          Bede's writings are classed as scientific, historical, and
          theological. The scientific include treatises on grammar
          (written for his pupils), a work on natural phenomena (De rerum
          natura), and two on chronology (De temporibus and De temporum
          ratione). The most important and best known of his works is the
          Historia ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum, giving in five books the
          history of England, ecclesiastical and political, from the time
          of Cæsar to the date of completion (731). The first twenty-one
          chapters, treating of the period before the mission of
          Augustine, are compiled from earlier writers such as Orosius,
          Gildas, Prosper of Aquitaine, and others, with the insertion of
          legend and tradition. After 596, documentary sources, which Bede
          took pains to obtain, are used, and oral testimony, which he
          employed not without critical consideration of its value. His
          other historical works were lives of the abbots of Wearmouth and
          Jarrow, and lives in verse and prose of St. Cuthbert. The most
          numerous of his writings are theological, and consist of
          commentaries on the books of the Old and New Testaments,
          homilies, and treatises on detached portions of Scripture. His
          last work, completed on his death-bed, was a translation into
          Anglo-Saxon of the Gospel of John.

   Bedell, William
          BEDELL, WILLIAM: Irish bishop; b. at Black Notley, near
          Braintree (50 m. n.e. of London), Essex, England, on or near
          Christmas day, 1571; d. at Drum Corr, near Kilmore, County
          Cavan, Ireland, Feb. 7, 1642. He studied at Emmanuel College,
          Cambridge (B.A., 1588; M.A., 1592; B.D., 1599), was ordained
          priest Jan. 10,1597, and settled at Bury St. Edmunds, Suffolk,
          in 1602. In 1607 he went to Venice as chaplain to Sir Henry
          Wotton, British ambassador at that city, and there he made the
          acquaintance of a number of noteworthy men, including Marco
          Antonio de Dominis and Father Paolo Sarpi, author of the History
          of the Council of Trent, the last two books of which, as well as
          Sarpi's History of the Venetian Interdict, he afterward
          translated into Latin. He returned to Bury St. Edmunds in 1610,
          and removed to Horningsheath, a neighboring parish, in 1616. In
          1627 he was appointed provost of Trinity College, Dublin; in
          1629 he became bishop of the united dioceses of Kilmore and
          Ardagh (County Longford); in 1633 he resigned the latter see
          owing to conscientious objections to pluralities, and the belief
          that the proper administration of the diocese required a
          separate bishop. His position was difficult; the dioceses were
          in wretched condition, and his earnest efforts to effect
          improvement stirred up opposition. Nevertheless he reformed many
          abuses and enjoyed great esteem among the people. He wrote a
          short summary of Christian doctrine in English and Irish
          (published, Dublin, 1631), and a translation of the Old
          Testament into Irish was made under his supervision (published,
          London, 1685). When the rebellion of 1641 broke out, he refused
          to leave his diocese, and, after suffering many hardships, died
          of fever brought on by the privations which he had undergone.
          His Life with the Letters between Waddesworth and Bedell was
          published by Bishop Burnet (London, 1685), and has been
          rewritten several times. The best biography is one by his son
          (ed. for the Camden Society T. W. Jones, London, 1872).

   Beecher, Charles
          BEECHER, CHARLES: Congregationalist, fifth son of Lyman Beecher;
          b. at Litchfield, Conn., Oct. 7, 1815; d. at Georgetown, Mass.,
          Apr. 21, 1900. He was graduated at Bowdoin College 1834 and at
          Lane Theological Seminary 1836; became pastor of the Second
          Presbyterian Church, Fort Wayne, Ind., 1844; of the First
          Congregational Church, Newark, N. J., 1851; of the First Church,
          Georgetown, Mass., 1857. He lived in Florida 1870-1877, and for
          two years was State superintendent of schools. He published: The
          Incarnation (New York, 1849); A Review of the Spiritual
          Manifestations (1853); David and his Throne (1855); Redeemer and
          Redeemed (Boston, 1864); and Spiritual Manifestations (1879).
          With John Zundel he edited the music for The Plymouth Collection
          of Hymns and Tunes (New York, 1855), and, alone, the
          Autobiography, Correspondence, etc. of his father (2 vols.,
          1865).

   Beecher, Edward
          BEECHER, EDWARD: Congregationalist, second son of Lyman Beecher;
          b. at East Hampton, L. I., Aug. 27, 1803; d. in Brooklyn July
          28, 1895. He was graduated at Yale 1822; began his theological
          studies at Andover and continued them while acting as tutor at
          Yale 1825-26; was pastor of the Park Street Church, Boston,
          1826-30; president of Illinois College, Jacksonville, Ill.,
          1830-44; pastor of the Salem Street Church, Boston, 1844-55, and
          editor of The Congregationalist 1849-1853; pastor at Galesburg,
          Ill., 1855-71; after 1871 resided in Brooklyn. He was lecturer
          on church institutions at the Chicago Theological Seminary
          (Congregational) 1859-66. In 1837 he defended the freedom of the
          press in the case of Elijah P. Lovejoy, an antislavery agitator
          at Alton, Ill. When Lovejoy's presses were destroyed by the mob,
          Beecher helped to obtain and secrete a new one, and was with
          Lovejoy and his brother, Owen, the night before the former was
          killed (Nov. 7, 1837). To resist the mob spirit he aided in
          founding the Illinois State Antislavery Society, drew up its
          constitution, and issued a Statement of Antislavery Principles,
          and Address to the People of Illinois. He published a Narrative
          of Riots at Alton (Cincinnati, 1838). His views as to the nature
          and cause of sin and on the atonement were set forth in two
          works, The Conflict of Ages, or the Great Debate on the Moral
          Relations of God and Man (Boston, 1853) and The Concord of Ages,
          or the Individual and Organic Harmony of God and Man (New York,
          1860), in which he expressed the belief that the present life is
          a continuation of a preceding existence as well as a preparation
          for a future one; that the material system is adapted to
          regenerate men, who have made themselves sinful in the previous
          state; and that ultimately the conflict between good and evil
          will disappear, and harmony be established. The doctrine of
          divine suffering he held to present the character of God in its
          most affecting and powerful aspects, and to be essential to a
          true view of the atonement. He also published On the Kingdom of
          God (Boston, 1827); Baptism with Reference to its Import and
          Modes (New York, 1849); The Papal Conspiracy Exposed and
          Protestantism Defended in the Light of Reason, History, and
          Scripture (New York, 1855); History of Opinions on the
          Scriptural Doctrine of Retribution (1878).

   Beecher, Henry Ward
          BEECHER, HENRY WARD: Congregationalist, fourth son of Lyman
          Beecher; b. at Litchfield, Conn., June 24, 1813; d. in Brooklyn
          Mar. 8, 1887. He was graduated at Amherst 1834, and at Lane
          Theological Seminary 1837; became pastor of the Presbyterian
          Church at Lawrenceburg, Ind., 1837, at Indianapolis 1839, and of
          Plymouth Church (Congregational), Brooklyn, 1847. The
          congregation was newly formed at that time, but soon became
          famed for its numbers and its influence, while Beecher attained
          to the position of the most popular and widely known preacher in
          America. As a public lecturer he was no less successful. In his
          sermons he disregarded conventionalities both in subject and
          manner. His wit and humor appeared in his preaching, which,
          nevertheless, was earnest and edifying, and revealed a great
          character, sincere and reverent; his public prayers in
          particular were truly devotional (cf. Prayers from Plymouth
          Pulpit, New York, 1867). No slight dramatic power, robust health
          and physical strength, and a striking personal appearance added
          to the effect of his eloquence. Personally he was a most
          estimable and attractive man, of generous instincts, of rare
          humanity, and catholic sympathies. He was active in the
          antislavery contest, but deprecated revolutionary measures. In
          1863 he publicly advocated the Union cause in a series of
          addresses in the cities of England at a time when the sympathies
          of the people of England were strongly with the Southern
          Confederacy, and his success at this time before bitterly
          hostile audiences is one of the greatest feats of intellectual
          and oratorical achievement (these addresses were published as
          The American Rebellion: Report of the Speeches delivered in
          Manchester, etc., Manchester, 1864, and are reprinted in
          Patriotic Addresses from 1850 to 1885 by Henry Ward Beecher,
          edited, with a review of Mr. Beecher's personality and influence
          in public affairs, by John R. Howard, New York, 1889).

          In later life the development of Beecher's mind led him to
          desire a freedom which he thought could not be attained within
          strictly denominational lines, and, actuated also by the wish
          not to compromise his brethren by alleged heresies, in 1882,
          with his church, he withdrew from the Congregational Association
          to which he belonged. The chief points of his divergence from
          the orthodox position of the time related to the person of
          Christ, whom he considered to be the Divine Spirit under the
          limitations of time, space, and flesh; to miracles, which he
          considered divine uses of natural laws; and to future
          punishment, the endlessness of which he denied, inclining to a
          modification of the annihilation theory.

          Beecher was regular contributor to The Independent from its
          foundation in 1848 to 1870, and its editor for not quite two
          years (1861-63). He was editor of The Christian Union (since
          1893 known as The Outlook), 1870-81, and made it the pioneer
          non-denominational religious paper. He also wrote much for The
          New York Ledger. His sermons were published weekly after 1859
          (under the title The Plymouth Pulpit), and have appeared in
          book-form in numerous volumes. Sermons . . . selected from
          published and unpublished discourses and revised by their
          author, edited by Lyman Abbott (2 vols., New York, 1868), is a
          representative collection. His addresses, lectures, and articles
          were also gathered into many books, such as Lectures to Young
          Men (Indianapolis, 1844; rev. eds., New York, Boston, 1850 and
          1873); the Star Papers, or experiences of art and nature
          (selections from The Independent, so called from his signature,
          *; 2 vols., New York, 1855-58); Eyes and Ears (reprinted from
          The New York Ledger, Boston, 1862); Lecture-Room Talks (New
          York, 1870); A Summer Parish (1875); Evolution and Religion
          (1885). His books of most permanent value were The Life of Jesus
          the Christ (i, New York, 1871; ii, left incomplete at his death
          and supplemented by extracts from his sermons, 1891), and the
          Yale Lectures on Preaching (Lyman Beecher lectures before the
          Yale Divinity School, 1872-74; 3 vols., also collected edition
          in one volume, New York, 1881). He compiled The Plymouth
          Collection of Hymns and Tunes (1855); and wrote Norwood, or
          Village Life in New England, a novel (1867).

   Beecher, Lyman
          BEECHER, LYMAN: Presbyterian; b. at New Haven, Conn., Oct. 12,
          1775; d. at Brooklyn Jan. 10, 1863. He was graduated at Yale
          1797; studied theology under President Dwight the following
          year, and, after preaching on probation for a year at East
          Hampton, L. I., was ordained as pastor there, 1799; in 1810 he
          removed to Litchfield, Conn., and in 1826 to Boston, as pastor
          of the Hanover Street Church (Congregational). In 1832 he became
          president and professor of theology at the newly formed Lane
          Theological Seminary, Cincinnati, where for the first ten years
          he also served as pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church. In
          1851 he returned to Boston, and after 1856 lived in Brooklyn. He
          was a profound student of theology, but eminently practical in
          his preaching, which was marked by an uncommon union of
          imagination, fervor, and logic. His convictions were strong, his
          courage great, and he acted with an impulsive energy which
          generally succeeded in accomplishing what he thought should be
          done. The death of Alexander Hamilton called forth a sermon on
          dueling (preached before the Presbytery of Long Island, Apr. 16,
          1806; published in several editions) which did much to awaken
          the popular conscience on the subject. At Litchfield he took a
          decided stand in favor of a general reformation of public
          morals, and in particular against the convivial habits of the
          time. During his Boston pastorate he was a leader on the
          conservative side in the Unitarian controversy. In Cincinnati
          hard feelings evoked by the antislavery contest, and certain
          problems inevitable during the formative period of the seminary
          and in a new society, made his career a stormy one, but he
          worked with characteristic energy and retired with honor. During
          the earlier stages of the differences which led to the
          disruption of the Presbyterian Church in 1837 he was charged
          with holding heretical views on the atonement, and was tried and
          acquitted by both presbytery and synod in 1835; throughout the
          entire contest he was one of the New School leaders. His seven
          sons all became clergymen and his daughters, Catherine Esther
          Beecher, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Isabella Beecher Hooker,
          became well known for literary and philanthropic work. During
          his second residence in Boston Lyman Beecher prepared a
          collected edition of his Works (i, Lectures on Political Atheism
          and Kindred Subjects; Six Lectures on Intemperance, Boston,
          1852; ii, Sermons, 1852; iii, Views of Theology as Developed in
          Three Sermons and on his Trials, 1853).

   Beecher, Thomas Kinnicutt
          BEECHER, THOMAS KINNICUTT: Congregationalist, sixth son of Lyman
          Beecher; b. at Litchfield, Conn., Feb. 10, 1824; d. at Elmira,
          N. Y., Mar. 14, 1900. He was graduated at Illinois College,
          Jacksonville, Ill., 1843; became school principal at
          Philadelphia, 1846, at Hartford, Conn., 1848; pastor at
          Williamsburg (Brooklyn), L. I., 1852, of the Independent Church
          (afterward called the Park Church), Elmira, 1854, where he
          served a long pastorate and became widely known for his
          eccentricities, but still more esteemed for his charities and
          respected for the practical good sense of many of his plans and
          ideas. He developed one of the first "institutional" churches,
          and his Sunday-school was a model one. His chief publication was
          Our Seven Churches (New York, 1870), a volume of discourses upon
          the different denominations in Elmira. In Time with the Stars, a
          book of children's stories, appeared posthumously (1902).

   Beecher, Willis Judson
          BEECHER, WILLIS JUDSON: Presbyterian; b. at Hampden, O., Apr.
          29, 1838. He studied at Hamilton College (B.A., 1858) and Auburn
          Theological Seminary (1864), and was ordained to the ministry in
          1864. After a pastorate at Ovid, N. Y., 1864-65, he was
          appointed professor of moral science and belles-lettres in Knox
          College, Galesburg, Ill. In 1869 he became pastor of the First
          Church of Christ in the same city. Two years later he was
          appointed professor of the Hebrew language and literature in
          Auburn Theological Seminary. In 1902 he delivered the Stone
          Lectures at Princeton Theological Seminary. He was a member of
          the Assembly's Committee on the Revision of the Confession of
          Faith (1890-92), and in theology is a progressive conservative.
          Besides preparing the Old Testament Sunday-school lessons for
          the Sunday School Times since 1893, he has written Farmer
          Tompkins and his Bibles (Philadelphia, 1874); General Catalogue
          of Auburn Theological Seminary (Auburn, 1883); Drill Lessons in
          Hebrew (1883); Index of Presbyterian Ministers, 1706-1881
          (Philadelphia, 1883; in collaboration with his sister Mary A.
          Beecher); The Prophets and the Promise (New York, 1905); and The
          Teaching of Jesus concerning the Future Life (1906).

   Beelzebub
          BEELZEBUB, be-el´ze-bUb (properly, in all the New Testament
          passages--Matt. x. 25; xii, 24, 27; Mark iii, 22; Luke xi, 15,
          18, 19--Beelzeboul); The name of the prince of the demons; i.e.,
          of Satan. The reading Beelzeboul has also this in its favor that
          the Greek oikodespotes, "master of the house" (Matt. x, 25),
          seems to play upon bee1 zebul (beel being the Aramaic form for
          the Hebrew baal). Nothing more than a play upon the word is to
          be sought in oikodespotes, which is not a translation of the
          Aramaic; "master of the (Satanic) kingdom" would be a
          meaningless designation of the prince of hell. In spite of the
          correctness of the reading Beelzeboul, it is justifiable to
          trace this name to the much older name Baal-zebub, which is
          found in the Old Testament as that of an idol.

          Baal-zebub was honored in Ekron, where he had a temple and an
          oracle, which was consulted by Ahaziah, king of Israel (II Kings
          i, 2, 3, 16). The name as it stands means "lord of flies"; the
          Septuagint calls the god directly "fly"; so also Josephus (Ant.,
          IX, ii, 1). In classical mythology, there was a god who
          protected from flies. It is related that Hercules banished the
          flies from Olympia by erecting a shrine to Zeus Apomuios
          ("averter of flies"); and the Romans called Hercules Apomuios. A
          similar deity is mentioned as acting and honored in different
          places, the excuse for such worship being the plague which flies
          cause in those warm countries. Both the sending of flies and the
          driving them away were referred to the same divinity. As may be
          inferred from the name Baal, the Baalzebub of the Philistines
          was essentially identical with the principal god or gods of the
          Phenicians. He may have been lord of flies as sun-god, because
          flies are most numerous in midsummer, when the sun is hottest.
          And that he had an oracle is to be explained by a substitution
          of effect for cause. Flies come obedient to certain atmospheric
          conditions; hence the god was considered to have caused these
          conditions, and so at length his control was extended to other
          events, and accordingly he was consulted (see [16]Baal).

          Beelzebul was early identified with Baal-zebub, and, as was so
          often the case, was turned into a bad demon, in accordance with
          later Jewish ideas. Since Lightfoot (Horæ Heb., s.v.), it has
          been common to say that the name of the demon Beelzebul was
          purposely made out of Beel-zebub, in order to express contempt
          and horror; i.e., "lord of dung," instead of "lord of flies."
          But, inasmuch as such a name for Satan does not occur outside of
          the New Testament, it is better to seek its derivation in the
          old Ekronic worship, which might, in New Testament times, have
          still existed. Beelzebul may therefore be looked upon as the
          same name as Beel-zebub, and therefore as having the same
          meaning.

          27, 1840. He attended Wesley College, Sheffield (1851-56), and
          took up mining engineering, but afterward studied theology at
          the Wesleyan College, Richmond (1862-64). He was pastor 1864-85
          and professor of systematic theology in Wesleyan College,
          Richmond, 1885-1905. He was also a member of the faculty of
          theology in the University of London 1901-05. He delivered the
          Fernley Lecture on The Credentials of the Gospels in 1889, and
          lectured in America in 1896. Though long recognized as one of
          the ablest theologians and exegetes of his denomination, his
          sympathy with the modern critical school of interpretation and
          particularly his views on eschatology have occasioned much
          criticism. In The Last Things (London, 1897; 2d ed., 1905) he
          opposed the belief that the essential and endless permanence of
          the soul is taught in the Bible and denied that eternal
          punishment necessarily means endless torment, holding that the
          sinner may suffer a relative annihilation of his mental and
          moral faculties and sink into a dehumanized state. He reiterated
          these views in The Immortality of the soul (1901). Charges of
          heresy were brought against him at the Conference of 1902, but
          he was reelected to his professorship on condition that he
          refrain from expressing his opinions on immortality and future
          punishment. To regain liberty of speech in 1904 he gave notice
          that he would retire from his chair in twelve months. His other
          works are: Commentary on Romans (London, 1877); Holiness as
          Understood by the Critics of the Bible (1880); Commentary on
          Corinthians (1881); Commentary on Galatians (1883); Commentary

          Christian Faith (1892); The New Life in Christ (1895); Nature
          and Christ (New York, 1896); Key to Unlock the Bible (1901);

          he was pastor at Sioux Center, Ia., until 1899, and since the
          latter year has been pastor of the Lagrave Street Christian
          Reformed Church, Grand Rapids. He has been secretary of the
          Board of Heathen Missions of his Church since 1900, stated clerk
          of its synod since 1902, and a member of the joint committee of
          American and Canadian Churches for the revision of the Psalms in

          31, 1808; d. in Edinburgh Sept. 29, 1883. He studied at Glasgow
          and Edinburgh; was ordained minister at Maxwelltown, Dumfries,
          May, 1830; became colleague at Lady Glenorchy's Chapel,
          Edinburgh. Dec., 1830, minister in Paisley 1831, at Liberton,
          near Edinburgh, 1835, and, after the Disruption in 1843, at
          Newington, a suburb of Edinburgh. In 1865 he was moderator of
          the General Assembly of the Free Church. He began his career as
          an ardent supporter of evangelical views and a decided opponent
          of the "moderate" party in the Church. He was strongly opposed
          to lay patronage and to voluntaryism. He strenuously resisted
          the aggressions of the civil courts on the jurisdiction of the
          Church and was disposed to continue the fight within the
          Establishment; but in May, 1843, he left with his brethren. (See
          the section on the Free Church of Scotland in the article
          [17]Presbyterians.) In the Free Church he became the leader of a
          minority opposed to all change and when he was charged with
          standing in the way of progress he gloried in his steadfast
          adherence to the ideas of his youth; his followers were most
          numerous in the Highlands. He was an advocate and supporter of
          popular education and was interested in a movement to secure
          better homes for the working classes. He wrote much for
          periodicals and edited several journals at different times (The
          Bulwark, for the maintenance of Protestantism; The Watchword,
          against the union with the United Presbyterians; The Signal,
          against instrumental music in worship). Among his larger
          publications were A Handbook of Popery (Edinburgh, 1852); Happy
          Homes for Workingmen and How to Get Them (London, 1866); Free
          Church Principles (Edinburgh, 1869), and The Principles,
          Position, and Prospects of the Free Church of Scotland (1875).

    1. Origin.

          Beghards and Beguines are the names applied to certain religious
          communities which flourished especially in the Middle Ages. The
          Beguines were women and earlier in origin than the male
          associations, the Beghards (also called in France Béguins). As
          early as the thirteenth century the authentic tradition as to
          the origin of the Beguines had been lost, so that it was
          possible in the fifteenth for the belief to gain acceptance that
          they had been founded by Begga, the canonized daughter of Pepin
          of Landen and mother of Pepin of Heristal. This belief was
          supported by several scholars in the early seventeenth century,
          and approved at Mechlin and at Rome. In 1630 Puteanus (van
          Putte), a Louvain professor, produced three documents supposed
          to date from 1065, 1129, and 1151, relating to a convent of
          Beguines at Vilvorde, near Brussels. The view as to the date of
          their origin which these documents supported was prevalent for
          two centuries, and is presupposed in the modern works of Mosheim
          and of Lea; but the researches of Hallmann proved finally in
          1843 that Puteanus's documents were forgeries, probably
          belonging to the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries. The origin
          of these communities is now, accordingly, almost universally
          placed in the twelfth century, and attributed to a priest of
          Liége, [18]Lambert le Bègue.

    2. The Early Communities.

          The scarcity of information about the earliest period has caused
          the significance of the movement to be underestimated or
          misconceived. As a matter of fact, the career of Lambert has
          many points of affinity with those of his younger contemporaries
          Peter Waldo and Francis of Assisi. Like them, he renounced his
          property, to endow with it the hospital of St. Christopher at
          Liége and the new convent of Beguines there. He felt his special
          mission to be the preaching of repentance, which brought him
          into conflict with the ecclesiastical authorities when he
          attacked the vices of the clergy, but had an enduring influence
          especially on the women of Liége. By 1210 there is contemporary
          testimony to the existence there of "whole troops of holy
          maidens"; the ascetic spirit took hold also of the married
          women, who frequently made vows of continence. Religious
          excitement did not fail to produce pathological phenomena;
          stories are told of visions, prophecies, convulsions, incessant
          tears, loss of speech, and the like. Probably between 1170 and
          1180 some of Lambert's followers, to whom his opponents gave the
          name of Beguines in mockery, had formed a sort of conventual
          association on a suburban estate belonging to him. By the
          analogy of the later Beguinages, they probably inhabited a
          number of small houses grouped about the church and hospital of
          St. Christopher, and shut off by a wall from the outer world.
          The first inmates were mostly women of position, who renounced
          their property and supported themselves by their own labors.

    3. Extension during the Twelfth Century.

          The religious impulse given by Lambert continued active after
          his death (probably 1187), and familiarized the people of the
          Netherlands with the idea of ascetic following of Christ long
          before the advent of the mendicant orders. Throughout the next
          century, the need of founding similar institutions for the large
          numbers of Beguines was felt, first in Flanders and then in the
          neighboring French and German districts. In France St. Louis
          showed them special favor, and erected a large Beguinage in
          Paris, modeled after the Flemish, in 1264; others sprang up,
          large or small, in all parts of France during the thirteenth and
          fourteenth centuries. The extension of the system in the other
          Latin countries was probably considerable, but exact data are
          wanting. In Germany only a few towns on the lower Rhine, such as
          Aix-la-Chapelle and Wesel, had Beguinages in the strict sense.
          Here the usual rule was for women who wished to renounce the
          world at first to live separately in their own houses or in
          solitary places; as time went on, they came together in larger
          or smaller houses put at their disposal by pious gifts, and
          formed communities of a monastic type. The growth of these
          convents was remarkable, and continued from the first third of
          the thirteenth century to the beginning of the fifteenth, by
          which time the majority of German towns had their convents of
          Beguines. The statutes varied much in the different houses; the
          number of inmates was between ten and twenty on an average.
          There was no uniform dress, but most of the members wore hoods
          and scapulars resembling a religious habit. Sometimes those who
          had property retained full control of it; in other cases a
          portion fell to the convent when they died or left. Celibacy was
          required as long as they stayed, but they were always free to
          leave and marry.

    4. Relation to the Mendicant Orders.

          The name of "voluntary poor," which many convents bore, and the
          regulations of such houses, show the continuance of Lambert's
          influence in favor of desertion of the world and penitential
          asceticism; but the Franciscan ideas, very similar in their
          tendency, which were widely spread not long after, found here a
          fruitful soil. As early as the thirteenth century a large
          proportion of the Beghards or Beguines of France, Germany, and
          northern Italy were under the direction of Franciscans or
          Dominicans, and so closely related with the penitential
          confraternities attached to both these orders that the members
          of these (tertiaries) were commonly known in the Latin countries
          as beguini and beguinæ--a fact which has caused much confusion
          in the study of the history of the real Beguines. The
          disapproval of these latter by the papal authorities brought
          about, when it came, a still closer identification with the
          tertiaries; many joined these for protection, and in the
          fifteenth century numerous Beguinages were transferred to the
          Augustinian order. While the original Beguines abstained from
          begging, it became more common among them in France and Germany
          by the beginning of the thirteenth century. As in the Latin
          countries the Beguines are found among the extreme defenders of
          the Franciscan ideal of poverty, so we find frequently among
          those of Germany the belief that their strict poverty designated
          them as the true followers of Christ. In accordance with this
          view, they were apt to withdraw themselves from the teaching of
          the clergy and listen rather to the exciting exhortations of
          their "mistresses" or of wandering preachers in sympathy with
          their beliefs. They developed a system of extreme corporal
          austerity, and lost themselves in mystic speculations which
          increased their tendency to see visions and to condemn the
          ordinary means of grace; even the moral law seems at times to
          have been regarded as not binding upon them. The impulse of
          apocalyptic enthusiasm, given by [19]Joachim of Fiore and spread
          by the "spiritual" Franciscans among the laity, as well as the
          quietistic mysticism of the [20]Brethren of the Free Spirit,
          found an entrance into their houses before the end of the
          thirteenth century. Early in the next century, the influx of
          women of high social position declined more and more, and the
          new foundations took on more of the modern character of
          benevolent institutions. By the end of the fifteenth century, in
          Germany at least, they had almost completely lost their first
          religious fervor and had forfeited much of the popular respect
          they had formerly enjoyed.

    5. The Male Communities.

          As to the Beghards or male communities, the question whether the
          first associations known by this name can be directly connected
          with Lambert le Bègue, or sprang up after his death in imitation
          of the Flemish Beguinages, can not be decided with our present
          knowledge. They are first met with in Louvain (c. 1220) and
          Antwerp (1228). The names beguin and begard (Flemish usually
          bogard; Middle High German begehart and biegger) were given in
          mockery and are of Walloon origin; other names are Lollards
          (probably from the Middle Dutch löllen, to murmur; see
          [21]Lollards), "voluntary poor," boni pueri, boni valeti, etc.
          In the course of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries they
          spread throughout Germany, into Poland and the Alpine districts,
          and even into the Latin countries; but their numbers were much
          smaller than those of the Beguines. As early as the thirteenth
          century a number of their houses, too, connected themselves with
          the tertiaries of the two great mendicant orders. Like the
          Beguines, many of them were partizans of the views of the
          "spiritual" Franciscans and Fraticelli. They practised begging
          ostentatiously, frequently had no fixed abode, and wandered
          about in small groups, begging and winning adherents for their
          cause. They did not abandon this mode of life even after papal
          prohibitions were directed against them, but strengthened
          themselves by the adhesion of sympathizers who were expelled
          from the convents, and remained in close relations with the
          Beguines, by whom they were regarded as martyrs to the
          Franciscan ideal of poverty and channels of mystical
          revelations. In the Netherlands the fifteenth-century Beghards
          appear for the most part as regular Franciscan tertiaries,
          organized from 1443 as a separate Congregatio Zepperensis
          beghardorum tertiæ regulæ S. Francisci, with the convent of
          Zepperen, near Hasselt, as their mother house. Internal
          dissensions later split them into two branches. In the
          seventeenth century they were united with the Lombard
          congregation of regular tertiaries, and did not survive the
          Revolution. The internal organization of their houses
          corresponded generally to that of the Beguines. The earliest
          Dutch Beghards were mostly weavers, who continued to follow
          their trade; later they frequently copied and sold manuscripts.
          The German Beghards followed a variety of occupations; but at
          the end of the Middle Ages begging was their main source of
          revenue. A special inner group was that of the "Voluntary Poor"
          (also called Poor Brothers, Cellites, Alexians; in the
          Netherlands Lollards, Matemans, Cellebroeders; see
          [22]Alexians), who required the entire abandonment of property
          by their members and bound them by permanent vows. Their strict
          organization, their enthusiasm for poverty, their zealous
          devotion to charitable duties, all point to a tradition reaching
          back to the beginning of the Beghard system. They are further
          contrasted with the ordinary Beghards by the fact that they held
          aloof for the most part from the Franciscan affiliations which
          have been seen to be so common. In the fifteenth century they
          associated themselves with the Augustinians. Public opinion, by
          the end of the Middle Ages, was even more unfavorable to the
          Beghards than to the Beguines; popular satirists and preachers
          alike speak of them as hypocritical beggars with a tendency to
          deceit and immorality; and the Reformation swept away the last
          remnants of them, in Germany at least.

    6. Persecution as Heretics.

          The persecution of Beghards and Beguines as a heretical sect
          began in the second half of the thirteenth century, probably as
          a consequence of their relation to the "spiritual" Franciscans
          (see [23]Francis, Saint, of Assisi, and the Franciscan Order).
          By 1300 the name beguinus was commonly used in the Latin
          countries as the accepted designation for the heretical
          "spiritual" party and Fraticelli, which naturally prejudiced the
          general opinion of the orthodox convents of Beghards and
          Beguines. Still more damaging was the fact that the German
          bishops, about the same time, assumed that the pantheistic
          heresy of the [24]Brethren of the Free Spirit found its chief
          support in their houses. Though, as a matter of fact, this was
          probably true only of a small section, the name of Beghards was
          commonly adopted in Germany for the adherents of that heresy.
          During the fourteenth century the belief spread that in some
          convents of Beghards and Beguines there existed an inner circle
          of "the perfect" who were alien from the doctrines of the Church
          and the laws of morality, to which the younger members were
          admitted only after years of probation. Whether or not these
          accusations were true, which it is now next to impossible to
          determine, the bitter hostility shown against the Beghards and
          Beguines probably finds its simplest explanation in the
          conflicts which arose at the end of the thirteenth century
          between the episcopate and the secular clergy, on the one hand,
          and the mendicant orders, especially the Franciscans, on the
          other, since these latter gained their lay following largely
          through the numerous houses of Beghards and Beguines. Several
          German provincial councils (Cologne 1306, Mainz 1310, Treves
          1310) passed strong measures against them, and the Council of
          Vienne (1311) struck at them even harder, undertaking to
          suppress them entirely on the charge of spreading heretical
          doctrines under a cloak of piety. The execution of these decrees
          of suppression, which took place under John XXII, caused great
          confusion in the Church of Germany, the mendicants and sometimes
          the magistrates attempting to defend the Beguines. Since their
          total suppression appeared impracticable, John XXII compromised
          by making a distinction and granting toleration to the orthodox
          Beguines. Persecution did not, however, cease; and with the
          powerful support of the Emperor Charles IV, it was taken up once
          more by Urban V and Gregory XI. Without regard to the varying
          senses of the names, all Beghards and Beguines alike were
          condemned as heretics, excommunicated, and outlawed. Their
          property was to serve for pious purposes, for the support of the
          inquisitors, or for repairing city walls and roads. Between 1366
          and 1378 remorseless persecution raged against them throughout
          Germany; but even then they found advocates, especially among
          the secular magistrates, and Gregory XI was finally prevailed
          upon to repeat the distinction between orthodox and heretical
          Beguines and Beghards, and to tolerate the former. About 1400
          another storm broke out, aroused by the attacks which the clergy
          of Basel, especially the Dominican Johannes Mülberg made upon
          the Beguines of that city. By 1410 the Beguines in the dioceses
          of Constants, Basel, and Strasburg were driven from their
          convents. At the time of the Council of Constants (1414-18),
          which showed itself well disposed toward them, they won a
          victory of some importance when they secured the condemnation as
          heretical of a treatise directed both against them and against
          the Brethren of the Common Life by the Dominican Matthæus Grabo.
          Attacks were still made upon them, none the less, and that a
          general feeling inspired such attacks is shown by the fact that
          the name "Beghard" continued through the fifteenth century to be
          applied to the most various heretics, until it adhered
          permanently to the Bohemian Brethren or Picards.

    7. Surviving Beguinages in the Netherlands.

          In what is now Belgium and Holland, the example of Lambert's
          first followers was widely followed, as has been seen; here the
          Beguines flourished most, and here they have maintained their
          existence to the present day. A long series of accounts of
          mystical visions, hysterico-ecstatic phenomena, and extreme
          austerities shows that the strong religious impulse of the
          beginning remained operative until after the Reformation.
          Heretical mysticism was not without its adherents: in 1310
          Margareta Porete, a Beguine of Hainault and the author of a book
          of apparently pantheistic libertinism, was executed in Paris,
          and the mystic [25]Hadewich Blommaerdine of Brussels (d.1336)
          found adherents among the Beguines of Brabant and Zeeland. The
          bishops and princes, however, protected the communities in times
          of persecution. In the fourteenth century the contemplative life
          was largely given up in favor of diligent work for the sick and
          poor, and later for the education of girls. The French
          Revolution deprived these institutions of their religious
          character, which they regained in 1814. At present there are
          fifteen Beguinages in Belgium, only two of which are of any
          size, both at Ghent, numbering 869 inmates in 1896. The larger
          one, transferred in 1874 to St. Amandsberg just outside the
          city, is a complete model of a small town, with walls, gates,
          streets, and gardens. The total number of Beguines in Belgium
          was 1,790 in 1825, 1,480 in 1866, and about 1,230 in 1896. In
          Holland two houses have survived, one at Amsterdam with thirteen
          inmates and one at Breda with forty-nix.

   Begin, Louis Nazaire
          BEGIN, bê´´gan´, LOUIS NAZAIRE: Roman Catholic archbishop of
          Quebec; b. at Lévis, Quebec, Jan. 10, 1840. He was educated at
          the Seminary of Quebec (1857-62) and Laval University (B.A.,
          1863). He then began the study of theology at the Grand Seminary
          of Quebec, but was chosen to fill a chair in the newly
          established faculty of theology in the University of Laval, and
          was sent to Rome to study. He was ordained to the priesthood in
          1865, and returned to Quebec in 1868, where he taught dogmatic
          theology and ecclesiastical history at Laval University until
          1884, in addition to being prefect of the Little Seminary and
          having charge of the pupils of the University during the last
          few years of this period. In 1884 he accompanied the archbishop
          of Quebec to Rome to defend the rights of Laval University, and
          on his return was appointed principal of the Normal School,
          remaining there until 1888. In the latter year he was
          consecrated bishop of Chicoutimi, and three years later was
          appointed coadjutor, with the title of archbishop of Cyrene, to
          Cardinal Taschereau. On the death of the Cardinal in 1898, he
          became archbishop of Quebec. He has written La Primauté et
          l'infaillibilité des souverains pontifes (Quebec, 1873); La
          Sainte Écriture et la règle de la foi (1874; English translation
          by G. M. Ward, London, 1875); Le Culte catholique (1875);
          Aide-mémoire, ou chronologie de l'histoire du Canada (1886); and
          Catéchisme de controverse (1902).

   Behaism
          BEHAISM: A development of [26]Babism. The Bab had taught that
          the greatest and last of all manifestations of divinity was to
          appear and, through his teachings, wipe out all distinctions of
          sects. In 1862, twelve years after the Bab's execution, Beha
          Ullah, a high-born Persian and Babite leader, claimed to be the
          fulfilment of this teaching. He was imprisoned and exiled and
          died in Acre, Syria, in 1892. His son, Abdul Beha Abbas, then
          became the leader and "Center of the Covenant." From his
          residence in Acre, where he lives under government surveillance,
          a far-reaching propaganda has gone forth and pilgrims find their
          way thither even from distant America.

          Behaist missionaries are not allowed to accept money, though
          they may be entertained by converts or others interested. Their
          message consists in a recital of the history of their religion
          and the lives of the Bab and Beha Ullah. The Old and New
          Testament prophecies and the sacred books of ethnic religions
          are studied in the belief that they establish the Behaist
          doctrines. Their sacred writings are the works of Beha Ullah, of
          which the most remarkable is the Book of Ighan. They are mostly
          short sentences called "communes," consisting of prayers or
          truths for the guidance of life. The explanation of the Book of
          Ighan and the "Hidden Words" in Arabic and Persian is a part of
          the regular preaching. The beauty of service to the poor and
          suffering is a cardinal precept. Simplicity in food and dress is
          another, and herein Abdul Beha is an example to his followers.
          Polygamy is not allowed and all goods are held in common. It is
          believed that God has manifested himself at different times
          according to the needs of the race, the chief manifestations
          having been three in number; viz., Jesus--whose life and
          teachings are commended,--the Bab, and Beha Ullah, who is the
          greatest and last; after him there will be no other
          manifestation, and whosoever does not believe on him after
          having heard his words will not have another chance to enter the
          kingdom. Certain feasts are observed commemorating events in the
          life of Beha Ullah, and one which was instituted by the Bab
          consists in a simple repast such as fruits, nuts, and cool
          water, held at the home of a believer every nineteen days; a
          vacant seat is left at the head of the table for the absent
          master, and passages from the "Hidden Words" are read as the
          food is passed.

          Behaist congregations are known as "assemblies." The first in
          America was established in Chicago by a Syrian, Ibrahim
          Kheirallah, in 1894. There are now thirty-five in America, each
          independent of the others and owning no authority but that of
          Abdul Beha. It is claimed that the mission of Behaism is to
          unify the world and bring all religions into one. [3]

   Bekker, Balthasar
          BEKKER, BALTHASAR: Dutch precursor of rationalism; b. at
          Metslawier (4 m. n.e. of Dokkum) Mar. 30, 1634; d. in Friesland
          June 11, 1698. He studied at Groningen under J. Alting and in
          Franeker, where he was rector of the Latin school, was made
          doctor of theology, and preacher in 1666. Being an enthusiastic
          follower of the Cartesian philosophy, he published at Wesel in
          1668 an Admonitio sincere et candida de philosophia Cartesiana,
          and gave greater offense by his catechisms in 1668 and 1670. He
          was accused of Socinianism, although Alting and other
          theologians pronounced him to be orthodox. After many
          controversies, he accepted a call as preacher to Weesp, and, in
          1679, to Amsterdam. The appearance of a large comet in 1680
          induced him to issue a work against, popular superstition, which
          stirred up more commotion; and, in 1691, in De betoverde Wereld,
          published at Leeuwarden, he denied the existence of sorcery,
          magic, possessions by the devil, and of the devil himself. The
          consistory of Amsterdam instituted a formal process against him,
          and he was deposed July 30, 1692. He went to Friesland, where he
          edited the last two books of his work.

   Bel
          BEL: A great Babylonian god, whose name, like the equivalent
          Hebrew Baal, originally and all through the history of the
          language was also used in the sense of "lord" or "owner" (see
          [32]Baal). The usage of the two words as names of deities also
          ran through parallel courses; for Bel at one time in Babylonia
          was a local deity like each of the Baals of the Canaanites. He
          was the patron deity of the city of Nippur in central Babylonia
          (the modern Nuffar), where his temple, of great antiquity, has
          been unearthed by the Pennsylvania expedition. The reason why
          there were not many Bels in Babylonia was that political union
          on a large scale was very early effected in that country, while
          it was always impossible among the Canaanites; and Nippur was
          the center of an extensive community in very remote times.

          When, under priestly influence, Babylonian theology was
          systematized, to this great god Bel was assigned sovereignty of
          the earth, while Anu ruled in the highest heaven, and Ea over
          the deep. These formed the chief trinity with primary and
          universal dominion.

          But it is not the Bel of Nippur whose name appears in the Bible
          and Apocrypha. On account of the rise and supremacy of the city
          of Babylon under Hammurabi (2250 B.C.), Marduk (Merodach), the
          god of that city, was invested with the prerogatives and even
          with the name of Bel, so that in the comparatively modern Old
          Testament times "Bel" stands for "Merodach" and for him only (so
          in Isa. xlvi, 1; Jer. li, 44; in Jer. l, 2 both names occur
          together, meaning practically "Bel-Merodach").

          The Babylonian Bel was not only adopted by the Assyrians as one
          of their chief gods (of course lower than Asshur), but like
          Ishtar (see [33]Ashtoreth), Sin, and Nebo, he seems to have
          obtained worshipers in the West-land. Such, at least, is an
          inference which has been drawn from the proper names Bildad
          ("Bel loves"), Ashbel ("man of Bel"), and Balaam. Moreover,
          "Bel" is found as an element in several Phenician and Palmyrene
          names. See [34]Babylonia, VII.

   Belgic Confession
          BELGIC CONFESSION: A statement of belief written in French in
          1561 by [36]Guy de Brès aided by H. Saravia (professor of
          theology in Leyden, afterward in Cambridge, where he died 1613),
          H. Modetus (for some time chaplain of William of Orange), and G.
          Wingen. It was revised by Francis Junius of Bourges (1545-1602),
          a student of Calvin, pastor of a Walloon congregation at
          Antwerp, and afterward professor of theology at Leyden, who
          abridged the sixteenth article and sent a copy to Geneva and
          other churches for approval. It was probably printed in 1562, or
          at all events in 1566, and afterward translated into Dutch,
          German, and Latin. It was presented to Philip II in 1562, with
          the vain hope of securing toleration. It was formally adopted by
          synods at Antwerp (1566), Wesel (1568), Emden (1571), Dort
          (1574), Middleburg (1581), and again by the great Synod of Dort,
          April 29, 1619. Inasmuch as the Arminians had demanded partial
          changes, and the text had become corrupt, the Synod of Dort
          submitted the French, Latin, and Dutch texts to a careful
          revision. Since that time the Belgic Confession, together with
          the Heidelberg Catechism, has been the recognized symbol of the
          Reformed Churches in Holland and Belgium, and of the Reformed
          (Dutch) Church in America.

          The Confession contains thirty-seven articles, and follows the
          order of the Gallican Confession, but is less polemical, full,
          and elaborate, especially on the Trinity, the Incarnation, the
          Church, and the Sacraments. It is, upon the whole, the best
          symbolical statement of the Calvinistic system of doctrine, with
          the exception of the Westminster Confession.

          The French text must be considered as the original. Of the first
          edition of 1561 or 1562 no copies are known. The Synod of
          Antwerp, in September, 1580, ordered a precise parchment copy of
          the revised text of Junius to be made for its archives, which
          copy had to be signed by every new minister. This manuscript has
          always been regarded in the Belgic churches as the authentic
          document. The first Latin translation was made from Junius's
          text by Beza, or under his direction, for the Harmonia
          Confessionum (Geneva, 1581). The same passed into the first
          edition of the Corpus et Syntagma Confessionum (Geneva, 1612). A
          second Latin translation was prepared by Festus Hommius for the
          Synod of Dort, 1618, revised and approved 1619; and from it was
          made the English translation in use in the Reformed (Dutch)
          Church in America. It appeared in Greek 1623, 1653, and 1660, at
          Utrecht.

   Belgium
          BELGIUM: A kingdom of northwestern Europe; area, 11,373 square
          miles; population, 6,800,000. After a revolt from Holland in
          1830, Belgium was recognized with its present boundaries by the
          Powers in 1839, when it was declared to be neutral territory.
          The population belongs to two nationalities, the northern
          portion, which is the larger, being Flemish (Low German), and
          the southern Walloon (French); the vernacular of forty-one per
          cent is French. The boundary between these two components may be
          defined as running from Maestricht west to the French department
          Nord.

    Protestants.

          The prevailing religion is Roman Catholic, since the Dutch
          Protestants, who were numerous from 1815 to 1830 have, for the
          most part, emigrated. (The Protestants constitute less than
          one-half of one per cent of the entire population.) The
          Evangelical confessions are represented in many cities, however,
          by immigrants from Germany in recent decades, as well as by
          Anglicans and Methodists and converts to Protestantism. The most
          numerous of these Protestant communions is the Union des Églises
          Évangéliques Protestantes de la Belgique, which was founded in
          1839 and consists of French, Dutch, and German congregations,
          being represented in Liége, Verviers, Seraing, Brussels,
          Antwerp, Ghent, La Bouverie, Dour, Paturages, Jolimont, and
          Tournai. The permanent bond of the Union is a board of
          directors, chosen at the annual synod of the congregations
          interested. Recognition by the State as a legal ecclesiastical
          body assures state aid to its clergy, the usual salary being
          2,220 francs, although it occasionally runs as high as 4,000 and
          6,000. An "evangelization committee" of the Union cares for
          scattered members, and especially for the religious education of
          children by "evangelists" where Protestant schools do not exist.
          The Union has between 16,000 and 18,000 members. The Société
          Évangélique or Église Chrétienne Missionnaire Belge is a free
          church consisting of converts from Roman Catholicism or their
          children. It is strongest in the Walloon districts and has
          numerous places of worship, united into three districts, whose
          representatives (Conseils Sectionnaires) meet four times
          annually. Over these three councils, to which each congregation
          sends a pastor and a layman, is the synod, of which the
          permanent executive body is the Comité Administrateur. The
          clergy are trained chiefly in Switzerland and are subordinate to
          the synod. This Church possesses few schools of its own, but in
          public schools of one class with twenty Protestant children and
          in those of several classes with forty children it is entitled
          to give religious instruction through its own clergy. It has now
          about 11,000 members. There are English churches at Antwerp,
          Bruges, Brussels, and Ostend, and at Antwerp and Brussels there
          are Presbyterian congregations; in the first-named city an agent
          of the American Seamen's Friend Society is also active. The
          Dutch Reformed and the Swedish Lutherans have small
          congregations in Brussels and Antwerp respectively.

    Roman Catholic Church.

          The Roman Catholic Church of Belgium was organized in 1561, when
          the authority of the foreign bishops was abrogated, and in 1839
          the system was readjusted to harmonize with the new boundaries.
          The most of the clergy receive their training at the episcopal
          seminaries and a small proportion at the University of Louvain.
          The State has no control over the appointment of priests, who
          are subject only to their bishops. The Roman Catholic Church,
          however, receives from the State an annual stipend of more than
          4,800,000 francs, although it does not enjoy any ecclesiastical
          prerogative. Its influence on the life of the people is exerted
          chiefly through the monasteries, of which there are more than
          220 for monks, with some 5,000 members, and about 1,500
          nunneries, with over 27,000 sisters. The members are employed in
          large numbers in the public schools, the right being given the
          communities by the law of 1884 to "adopt" private schools, or
          schools conducted by the religious organizations. A number of
          intermediate schools are also under ecclesiastical control, as
          well as the University of Louvain. Academic training is also
          provided for by the state universities of Ghent and Liége, and
          by the free university of Brussels.

    Diocesan Organization.

          In its hierarchic organization, Belgium constitutes the province
          of Mechlin, and its dioceses are divided according to the
          political boundaries of the country. The archdiocese of Mechlin
          on the Dyle was created by a papal enactment of 1559, which
          first came into full operation in 1561. It contains fifty-five
          parishes and over 600 chapels of ease in the provinces of
          Brabant and Antwerp. The suffragan bishoprics are those of
          Bruges, Ghent, Liége, Namur, and Tournai (Doornik). Bruges,
          founded in 1559, has forty parishes and 245 chapels of ease;
          Ghent, established in the same year, also has forty parishes and
          310 chapels of ease; Liége, dating from the fourth century, has
          an equal number of parishes and 570 chapels of ease; Namur,
          created in 1559 (1561), has the same number of parishes and 700
          chapels of ease; and Doornik, the seat of a bishop since 1146,
          controls thirty-three parishes and 445 chapels of ease, its see
          comprising the Hennegau, with the exception of five parishes
          belonging to the French diocese of Cambrai.

          The Jews of Belgium, who number about 5,000, are divided into
          twelve rabbinical districts.

   Belial
          BELIAL, bî´li-al ("worthlessness"): A word which occurs once in
          the New Testament (II Cor. vi, 15; better reading Beliar) as the
          name of Satan, hardly as that of Antichrist; the Peshito has
          "Satan." In the Old Testament beliyyaal is not used as a
          designation of Satan, or of a bad angel; it is an appellation,
          "worthlessness" or "wickedness" in an ethical sense, and is
          almost always found in connection with a word denoting the
          person or thing whose worthlessness or wickedness is spoken of;
          as, "man of Belial," "son of Belial," "daughter of Belial,"
          "thoughts of Belial," etc. In a few instances beliyyaal denotes
          physical destruction; so probably Ps. xviii, 4 (II Sam. xxii,
          5), "floods of destruction" (A. V. "ungodly men"; R. V.
          "ungodliness"). To understand this passage to refer to the
          prince of hell is against Old Testament usage. Occasionally the
          adjunct is omitted, as in II Sam. xxiii, 6; Job xxxiv, 18; Nahum
          i, 15, where the word means the "bad," the "destroyer," the
          "wicked." Although thus originally not a proper name, but an
          appellation, in the later Jewish and Christian literature it
          passed over into a name for Satan, not as the "worthless," but
          as the "destroyer." It is so used in II Cor. vi, 15, where Paul
          asks: "What harmony is there between Christ and Belial?"
          "Belial' stands for "Satan" also in Jewish epigraphs and
          apocalyptic writings, such as the Testaments of the Twelve
          Patriarchs, the Book of Jubilees, and the Jewish interpolations
          in the Sibylline Oracles.

          graduated at Yale, 1735, and was licensed to preach at the age
          of eighteen; was ordained pastor of the church at Bethlehem Apr.
          2, 1740. During the Great Awakening he preached as an
          itinerating evangelist; later he established a divinity school
          in his house, where many prominent New England clergymen were
          trained. He was a disciple and personal friend of Jonathan
          Edwards, and the most gifted preacher among his followers, being
          thought by some to be equal to Whitefield. In his True Religion
          Delineated (Boston, 1750) he sets forth in spirited style the
          plan of salvation and of the Christian life after the Edwardean
          conception, and he explicitly advocates the doctrine of a
          general atonement. In the Wisdom of God in the Permission of Sin
          (1758) he argues that, while sin is a terrible evil, God permits
          it as a necessary means of the best good, and the universe is
          "more holy and happy than if sin and misery had never entered."
          God could have prevented sin without violating free will. On the
          whole his work was more general than specific, modifying the
          prevalent conceptions in the direction of greater simplicity and
          reasonableness. He sometimes approaches quite near subsequent
          forms of expression. A collected edition of his works appeared
          at New York (3 vols., 1811), and another (and better) at Boston,
          with memoir by Tryon Edwards (2 vols., 1850).

   Bellarmine

  BELLARMINE, bel´´l?r-mîn´.

          In Louvain (§ 1).? In Rome. The Disputationes (§ 2).

          New Duties after 1589. Controversial Writings (§ 3).

          Roberto Francesco Romolo Bellarmino, the famous Roman Catholic
          controversialist, was born at Montepulciano (26 m. s.w. of
          Arezzo), in Tuscany, Oct. 4, 1542; d. in Rome Sept. 17, 1621. He
          was a nephew of Pope Marcellus II, and came of a noble though
          impoverished family. His abilities showed themselves early; as a
          boy he knew Vergil by heart, and composed a number of poems in
          Italian and Latin; one of his hymns, on Mary Magdalene, is
          included in the Roman breviary. His father destined him for a
          political career, hoping that he might restore the fallen
          glories of the house; but his mother wished him to enter the
          Jesuit order, and her influence prevailed. He entered the Roman
          novitiate in 1560, remained in Rome three years, and then went
          to a Jesuit house at Mondovi in Piedmont. Here he learned Greek,
          and taught it as fast as he learned it. His systematic study of
          theology began at Padua in 1567 and 1568, where his teachers
          were Thomists, the Jesuits not yet having had time to develop a
          theology of their own.

    1. In Louvain.

          After a visit to Venice, where he increased his renown as a
          public speaker, Bellarmine was sent by the general, Francis
          Borgia, in 1569, to Louvain, then the most famous Roman Catholic
          university. He was ordained priest at Ghent on Palm Sunday,
          1570, by the elder Jansenius. A strict Augustinian theology
          prevailed among the teachers at Louvain, represented by Bajus,
          the precursor of Jansenism (see [37]Bajus, Michel). Bellarmine
          had not enough deep knowledge of his own nature or Christian
          experience to be able to appreciate the Augustinian doctrines of
          the corruption of man and the necessity of divine grace to any
          good movement of the will. He contended accordingly against the
          propositions of Bajus, though his own views and expressions in
          the great controversy on grace were always a little uncertain.
          He was the first Jesuit to teach at the university, where the
          subject of his course was the Summa of St. Thomas; he also made
          extensive studies in the Fathers and medieval theologians, which
          gave him the material for his book De scriptoribus
          ecclesiasticis (Rome, 1613), which was later revised and
          enlarged by Sirmond, Labbeus, and Oudin. In the Netherlands he
          gained a knowledge of the great controversy with the Protestants
          which he could hardly have got in Italy, though he seems never
          to have come into personal contact with the evangelical leaders.
          Finally he learned Hebrew, and wrote his often reprinted
          grammar. His genius for teaching, clearness of thought, and
          adroitness in controversy were indisputable.

    2. In Rome. The "Disputationes."

          Bellarmine's residence in Louvain lasted seven years. His health
          was undermined by study and asceticism, and in 1576 he made a
          journey to Italy to restore it. Here he was detained by the
          commission given him by Gregory XIII to lecture on polemical
          theology in the new Roman College. He devoted eleven years to
          this work, out of whose activities grew his celebrated
          Disputationes de controversiis christianæ fidei, first published
          at Ingolstadt, 4 vols., 1581-93. It occupies in the field of
          dogmatics the same place as the Annales of Baronius in the field
          of history. Both were the fruits of the great revival in
          religion and learning which the Roman Catholic Church had
          witnessed since 1540. Both bear the stamp of their period; the
          effort for literary elegance, which was considered the principal
          thing at the beginning of the sixteenth century, had given place
          to a desire to pile up as much material as possible, to embrace
          the whole field of human knowledge, and incorporate it into
          theology. Bellarmine's exposition of the views and arguments of
          the Protestants is surprisingly full and accurate, so much so
          that the circulation of the book in Italy was for a time not
          encouraged. He fails, like most of his contemporaries, in
          understanding the principle of historical development, and his
          belief in authority, pressed to an extreme, injured his sense of
          truth and allowed him to handle both the Bible and history in an
          arbitrary manner. The first volume treats of the Word of God, of
          Christ, and of the pope; the second of the authority of
          councils, and of the Church, whether militant, expectant, or
          triumphant; the third of the sacraments; and the fourth of
          grace, free will, justification, and good works. The most
          important part of the work is contained in the five books on the
          Roman pontiff. In these, after a speculative introduction on
          forms of government in general, holding monarchy to be
          relatively the best, he says that a monarchical government is
          necessary for the Church, to preserve unity and order in it.
          Such power he considers to have been established by the
          commission of Christ to Peter. He then proceeds to demonstrate
          that this power has been transmitted to the successors of Peter,
          admitting that a heretical pope may be freely judged and deposed
          by the Church since by the very fact of his heresy he would
          cease to be pope, or even a member of the Church; this is almost
          like an echo of the great councils of the fifteenth century. The
          third section discusses Antichrist; Bellarmine gives in full the
          theory set forth by the Greek and Latin Fathers, of a personal
          Antichrist to come just before the end of the world and to be
          accepted by the Jews and enthroned in the temple at
          Jerusalem--thus endeavoring to dispose of the Protestant
          exposition which saw Antichrist in the pope. The fourth section
          sets forth the pope as the supreme judge in matters of faith and
          morale, though making the concessions (confirmed indeed by the
          Vatican Council) that the pope may err in questions of fact
          which may be known by ordinary human knowledge, and also when he
          speaks as a mere unofficial theologian, doctor privatus. His
          assertions are much more unbounded in the last part, which
          treats of the pope's power in secular matters. While he says
          that the pope has no direct jurisdiction in such things, he yet
          stoutly contends for the power of deposing kings, absolving
          subjects from their allegiance, and altering civil laws, when
          these actions are necessary for the good of the souls committed
          to the charge of the chief pastor.

    3. New Duties after 1589. Controversial Writings.

          Until 1589 Bellarmine was occupied altogether as professor of
          theology, but that date marked the beginning of a new epoch in
          his life and of new dignities. After the murder of Henry III of
          France Sixtus V sent Gaetano as legate to Paris to negotiate
          with the League, and chose Bellarmine to accompany him as
          theologian; he was in the city during its siege by Henry of
          Navarre. The next pope, Clement VIII (1591-1605), set great
          store by him. He wrote the preface to the new edition of the
          Vulgate, and was made rector of the Roman College in 1592,
          examiner of bishops in 1598, cardinal in 1599, and in 1602
          archbishop of Capua. He had written strongly against pluralism
          and non-residence, and he set a good example himself by leaving
          within four days for his diocese, where he devoted himself
          zealously to his episcopal duties, and firmly executed the
          reforming decrees of the Council of Trent. Under Paul V
          (1605-21) arose the great conflict, between Venice and the
          papacy, in which Fra Paolo Sarpi was the spokesman of the
          Republic, protesting against the papal interdict, reasserting
          the principles of Constance and Basel, and denying the pope's
          authority in matters secular. Bellarmine wrote three rejoinders
          to the Venetian theologians, and at the same time possibly saved
          Sarpi's life by giving him warning of an impending murderous
          attack. He soon had occasion to cross swords with a more
          prominent antagonist, James I of England, who prided himself on
          his theological attainments. Bellarmine had written a letter to
          the English archpriest Blackwell, reproaching him for having
          taken the oath of allegiance in apparent disregard of his duty
          to the pope. James attacked him in 1608 in a Latin treatise,
          which the scholarly cardinal answered at once, making merry with
          delicate humor over the defects of the royal Latinity. James
          replied with a second attack in more careful style, dedicated to
          the Emperor Rudolph II and all the monarchs of Christendom, in
          which he posed as the defender of primitive and truly Catholic
          Christianity. Bellarmine's answer to this covers more or less
          the whole controversy. In reply to a posthumous treatise of
          William Barclay, the celebrated Scottish jurist, he wrote
          another Tractatus de potestate summi pontificis in rebus
          temporalibus, which reiterated his strong assertions on the
          subject, and was therefore prohibited in France, where it agreed
          with the sentiments of neither the king nor the bishops. He was
          among the theologians consulted on the teaching of Galileo when
          it first made a stir at Rome. In his old age he was allowed to
          return to his old home, Montepulciano, as its bishop for four
          years, after which he retired to the Jesuit college of St.
          Andrew in Rome. He received some votes in the conclaves which
          elected Leo XI, Paul V, and Gregory XV, but only in the second
          case had he any prospect of election. Since his death the
          members of his order have more than once attempted to procure
          his canonization, but without success. The best of the older
          editions of his works is that in seven vols., Cologne, 1617;
          recent ones are those of Paris, 1870-74, and Naples, 1872.

   Bellows, Henry Whitney
          BELLOWS, HENRY WHITNEY: American Unitarian; b. in Boston June
          11, 1814; d. in New York Jan. 30, 1882. He was graduated at
          Harvard 1832, and at the Cambridge Divinity School 1837; was
          ordained pastor of the First Congregational Society (Unitarian),
          Chambers Street, New York, Jan. 2, 1838, and remained there till
          death; during his pastorate the church was twice moved, to
          Broadway between Spring and Prince Streets and the name changed
          to the Church of the Divine Unity, and again to 4th Avenue and
          20th Street, where it took the name of All Souls' Church. Dr.
          Bellows was the organizer, president, and chief administrator of
          the United States Sanitary Commission (1862-78), and during the
          Civil War he superintended with rare efficiency the distribution
          of supplies valued at $15,000,000 and $5,000,000 in money; at a
          later period he was president of the first civil service reform
          association organized in the country. He was president of the
          National Unitarian Conference 1865-79. He wrote much for the
          periodicals of his denomination and was the chief originator of
          The Christian Inquirer (New York, 1846) and for five years its
          principal contributor. He also published a number of books, of
          merely personal and transient interest.

   Bells

  BELLS.

    Early Use.

          The use of bells as adjuncts to Christian worship was not
          without precedent in pre-Christian times. Among the Jews the
          vestment of the high priest was adorned with little bells (Ex.
          xxviii, 33); and among the pagans the priests of Proserpine
          announced the beginning of the sacrifice by ringing bells. There
          is no evidence of early Christian use of them to summon people
          to prayer; this seems to have been done by word of mouth, even
          as late as Tertullian and Jerome. In the Egyptian monasteries
          the Old Testament use of trumpets still survived, and the sound
          made by knocking pieces of wood together served the same
          purpose; this custom is still sometimes used in the Roman
          Catholic Church on the last three days of Holy Week, when the
          ringing of bells is forbidden [and survives in some places in
          the East]. The first positive evidence of the use of bells in
          connection with Christian worship is found in Gregory of Tours
          (d. 595), who speaks of them as being rung at the beginning of
          the liturgy and the canonical hours. From the seventh century
          on, bells are often mentioned in the inventories of Western
          churches, and by 800 they were so common as to be found even in
          village churches. A capitulary of Charlemagne (801) prescribes
          that priests shall ring their bells at the accustomed hours of
          the day and night. In the ninth century some Eastern instances
          occur; thus Orso I, Doge of Venice, presented twelve bells to
          the Byzantine emperor, who placed them in a tower near St.
          Sophia. But outside of Russia they never attained the same
          importance as in the West. The Mohammedans usually removed them
          in the countries they conquered; and Zwingli attempted to
          abolish their use in Switzerland, though most of the Reformers
          only protested against superstition in the use of them,
          especially their consecration.

    Material and Form.

          Walafrid Strabo distinguishes two classes of bells in his time,
          vasa productilia and fusilia, wrought and cast. Of the now rare
          examples of the former class the best known is the "Saufang" at
          Cologne, so called because the legend ran that it had been dug
          up by pigs about 613; it is made of three plates of iron
          fastened together with copper nails. Similar and perhaps older
          examples are in the Edinburgh Museum. For the casting of bells a
          mixture of copper and tin was employed in the Middle Ages;
          afterward lead, zinc, iron, and antimony were used with copper.
          At present the best bell-metal is supposed to be a mixture of 77
          to 80 per cent of good copper with 20 to 23 per cent of pure
          tin. The earliest cast bells resemble cow-bells in form, though
          there are some shaped more like a beehive or a pear. Their
          dimensions are small.

    Inscriptions.

          As far as can be judged from the extant examples, the custom of
          putting inscriptions on bells does not go further back than the
          twelfth century, and is by no means general even then. On cast
          bells the inscriptions are rarely incised; where this occurs, it
          is a sign of antiquity. Later they are more commonly raised, and
          in either Roman or Gothic capitals down to the end of the
          fourteenth century; then small letters were used until about
          1550, and since then more modern types of letters have been
          usual, except in recent deliberate imitations of the old style.
          Until well into the fourteenth century Latin was the regular
          language; then the vernacular came into use. The earliest
          inscriptions were short; from the end of the sixteenth century
          much longer ones became usual, frequently almost filling the
          surface of the bell. They are mostly pious dedications or
          prayers, or declarations of the purpose of the bell, such as
          Funera plango, fulgura frango, sabbata pango; excito lentos,
          dissipo ventos, paco cruentos. Besides inscriptions, the sides
          of bells were adorned with pictures, coats of arms, seals, and
          various symbols, among the oldest being, besides the cross, the
          dove with the olive-branch, and the Agnus Dei.

    Benediction.

          As early as the Frankish sacramentaries and the Pontifical of
          Egbert special formulas for the benediction of bells are
          mentioned. This practise was connected in those days with
          superstitious notions, so that Charlemagne was obliged to
          regulate it in 789. But the formulas of benediction themselves
          attributed a quasimagical effect to the bells thus consecrated.
          According to present Roman Catholic usage, the blessing of bells
          is an episcopal prerogative, though priests may exercise it in
          case of necessity with the pope's permission. The ceremonies
          somewhat resemble those of baptism, which has given rise to the
          practise of naming bells, and in the Middle Ages of appointing
          sponsors for them, from whom rich christening gifts were
          expected. The Schmalkald Articles declared bitterly against
          these practises as "popish jugglery" and "a mockery of holy
          baptism."

    Present Use.

          The main use of bells has always been to announce the time of
          public worship. It is also a common Roman Catholic practise to
          ring the church bell at the consecration in the mass, as in some
          Protestant localities at the Lord's Prayer after the sermon,
          that those who are absent may unite themselves in spirit with
          the congregation. During the mass, moreover, a small bell
          (called the "Sanctus" or "sacring" bell) is rung at the
          specially solemn parts--the Sanctus, the beginning of the canon,
          the consecration, and the Domine, non sum dignus. Bells have
          been rung also at certain regular times to call to mind some
          mystery, as the passion and death or the incarnation of Christ
          (see [38]Angelus), or to bid to prayer for sinners, for the
          faithful departed, or for peace. The ringing of joyous peals at
          marriages, and the announcement of a death by solemn tolling
          (originally intended to move the hearers to prayer for the soul,
          either before or after death) are ancient practises; the latter
          existed, at least in the monasteries, in the time of Bede. In
          some parts of England a special bell was tolled with a similar
          intention before the execution of a criminal.

          BELSHAM, THOMAS: English Unitarian; b. at Bedford Apr. 26, 1750;
          d. at Hampstead Nov. 11, 1829. He finished his studies at the
          Dissenting Academy of Daventry and in 1770 became teacher there;
          in 1778 he became minister of an independent chapel at
          Worcester, but returned to Daventry as teacher and preacher in
          1781. Having adopted Unitarian views he resigned in 1789, and
          was professor of divinity at the college of Hackney until it
          ceased to exist in 1796. In 1794 he succeeded Dr. Priestley as
          minister of the Gravel Pit Unitarian Chapel at Hackney, and in
          1805 became minister of the Essex Street Chapel, London. He
          published much, sermons, controversial writings, and general
          theological works, including Elements of the Philosophy of the
          Mind and of Moral Philosophy (London, 1801); Letters to the
          Bishop of London in Vindication of Unitarians (1815); The
          Epistles of St. Paul Translated, with an Exposition and Notes (2
          vols., 1822); he was principal editor of The New Testament in an
          Improved Version upon the Basis of Archbishop Newcome's New
          Translation; with a critical text and notes critical and
          explanatory (1808). American Unitarianism (4th ed., Boston,
          1815) is extracted from his Memoirs of the Revd. T. Lindsey
          (London, 1812).

          100 m. n.w. of Christiania) Jan. 21, 1829. He received only an
          elementary education in his early years, and from 1851 was a
          teacher in village schools until 1858, when he was enabled to
          enter the University of Christiania, and graduated three years
          later. He was tutor at a teachers' seminary in 1863-64, and was
          then appointed pastor of a small parish in Finmarken near the
          Russian frontier. Six years later he was called to a parish in
          Bjelland, in the extreme south of Norway, but resigned in 1875
          and settled at Christiania, where he was enabled to continue his
          studies by his pension and a small additional stipend, while a
          government subvention later rendered it possible for him to
          visit foreign libraries. Died at Christiania July 15, 1909. His

   Bema
          BEMA: In classical literature a semicircular platform at the end
          of a basilica, which supported the official seat of the judge.
          When the basilican style was adapted to Christian use (see
          [41]Architecture, Ecclesiastical), the apse, or similar
          semicircular termination of the building, was reserved for the
          seats of the bishop and clergy, and the same name was sometimes
          applied to it. In a more restricted sense it signifies any
          elevated place in the church, such as that from which the gospel
          was read, and is thus synonymous with [42]ambo.

   Bembo, Pietro
          BEMBO, PIETRO: Cardinal and humanist; b. in Venice May 20, 1470;
          d. in Rome Jan. 18, 1547. He was the son of a senator, and
          studied at Padua and Ferrara, in the latter place attracting the
          attention of Alfonso d'Este and his wife, Lucrezia Borgia. He
          spent six years at the court of Urbino, where he became
          acquainted with Raffael. He then went to Rome, where Leo X
          recognized his ability as a Latinist by making him his
          secretary. As he held this office to the death of the pope
          (1521), the sixteen books of Latin letters of Leo X are
          practically, as to their form, of Bembo's composition. Returning
          to Padua, Bembo made his house the meeting-place of humanist
          circles. In 1530 he was commissioned by the Venetian senate to
          complete the history of the republic begun by Marcantonio
          Sabellico. His part of the work, covering the years 1487-1513,
          has been justly criticized as to historic accuracy by Justus
          Lipsius (Politica, i, Leyden, 1589, 9, note). On the other hand,
          not only in the Rime, but also in his letters, there is a
          regrettable tendency to a loose frivolity strongly bordering on
          pagan morals. This tendency, shown also in his manner of
          life--he was the father of several illegitimate children--was no
          obstacle to his being made a cardinal (1539). From that time on
          (he was now sixty-nine), he is said to have changed his life. He
          held two bishoprics, Gubbio and Bergamo, but he lived in Rome
          till his death. His Opera were published in three vols. at
          Basel, 1567; Strasburg, 1611-52; four vols., Venice, 1729. His
          Rime (Venice, 1530) have often been re-printed; as has his Gli
          Asolani (1505), a dialogue on the nature of love.

   Benaiah
          BENAIAH ("whom Yahweh built"): The name of several Israelites.
          The most important of them is the valorous son of Jehoiada of
          Kabzeel, a city in the south of Judah (Josh. xv, 21). He is
          honorably mentioned (II Sam. xxiii, 20 ff.; cf. I Chron. xi, 22
          ff.) among the mighty men of David, to whom he always faithfully
          adhered. Three heroic exploits of his are mentioned in
          justification of his rank: he slew the two sons of Ariel
          (according to the LXX), either a distinguished Moabite (so
          Josephus, Ant., VII, xii, 4) or the king of Moab, in the war
          with that people (II Sam. viii, 2); he killed a lion which had
          fallen into a pit in time of snow; and, finally, he overcame an
          Egyptian giant, who carried a spear so large that it seemed like
          a tree thrown across a ravine (according to an addition of the
          LXX), or like a weaver's beam (according to I Chron. xi, 23);
          Benaiah disarmed his opponent and killed him with his own
          weapon. Being prominent among David's "thirty heroes," Benaiah
          was set over the Cherethites and Pelethites, David's bodyguard
          (II Sam. viii, 18; xx, 23). In the beginning of Solomon's reign,
          to whom he became devoted at once (I Kings i, 8), Benaiah still
          held this office and executed the judgment of the king upon
          Adonijah and Joab (I Kings ii, 25, 30, 34), and became Joab's
          successor as commander-in-chief (I Kings ii, 35). When, under
          David, the army was organized, besides his regular office he had
          command over one of the twelve divisions of 24,000 men (I Chron.
          xxvii, 5, 6, where his father, Jehoiada, strange to say, is
          called "the priest," which is no doubt a mistaken gloss founded
          upon I Chron. xii, 27).

   Bender, Wilhelm (Friedrich)
          BENDER, WILHELM (FRIEDRICH): German Protestant; b. at Münzenberg
          (10 m. s.e. of Giessen), Hesse, Jan. 15, 1845; d. at Bonn Apr.
          8, 1901. He studied at Göttingen and Giessen, 1863-66, and at
          the theological seminary at Friedberg, 1866-67; became teacher
          of religion and assistant preacher at Worms, 1868; ordinary
          professor of theology at Bonn, 1876; was transferred to the
          philosophical faculty, 1888. He belonged to the extreme
          Ritschlian school, and published Der Wunderbegriff des Neuen
          Testaments (Frankfort, 1871); Schleiermachers Theologie mit
          ihren philosophischen Grundlagen (2 vols., Nördlingen, 1876-78);

   Benedicite
          BENEDICITE: The name given, from its first word in the Latin, to
          the canticle which stands in the Anglican Prayer-book as an
          alternative to the Te Deum, commonly used in Advent and Lent,
          and in the Roman breviary as a part of the priest's thanksgiving
          after celebrating mass. It is taken from the apocryphal fragment
          of the Song of the Three Holy Children (verses 35-65), which
          supplements the narrative of Dan. iii, and seems to have been
          used in public worship in the postexilic Jewish Church, and in
          the Christian at least from the fourth century.

   Benedict
          BENEDICT: The name of fourteen popes and one antipope.

          Benedict I: Pope 574-578. He was a Roman by birth, the son of
          Boniface, and succeeded John III, who died July 13, 573, but was
          unable to be consecrated before June 3, 574, because the
          Lombards had cut off communication with Constantinople and the
          imperial confirmation could not be obtained. Owing to the
          troubles of the barbarian invasion and a great famine, which
          occupied his mind, the Liber pontificalis (ed. Duchesne, i,
          Paris, 1886, 308) finds scarcely anything to say of his acts. He
          died July 30 or 31, 578, during the siege of Rome by the first
          Lombard Duke of Spoleto.

          Benedict II: Pope 683-685. He was elected after the death of Leo
          II, which took place on July 3, 683, though the imperial
          confirmation was delayed for almost a year. The Liber
          pontificalis (ed. Duchesne, i, Paris, 1886, 363) asserts that
          the emperor Constantine Pogonatus conceded the right to proceed
          at once to consecration for the future; but this is very
          doubtful, as it would amount to a total renunciation of the
          right of confirmation, and it is certain that several successors
          of Benedict waited to obtain it either from the emperor himself
          or his representative, the Exarch of Ravenna. During the
          interval intervening before his consecration, Benedict signed
          himself with the designation presbyter et in Dei nomine electus
          sancté sedis apostolicé. Like his predecessor, he had at heart
          the complete recognition by the Western Church of the sixth
          ecumenical council (Third Constantinople, 680). With this end in
          view, Leo II had sent the notary Peter to Spain, and immediately
          after his election Benedict wrote to Peter to carry out his
          commission. His wish was gratified by the condemnation of
          monothelitism in the fourteenth Council of Toledo (Nov., 684).
          Even before his consecration, which finally took place June 26,
          684, he espoused the cause of [43]Wilfrid of York and wrote in
          recognition of his innocence and his rights. Benedict died May
          8, 685.

          Benedict III: Pope 855-858. He was chosen immediately after the
          death of Leo IV by the clergy and people of Rome, but owing to
          the setting up of an antipope, Anastasius, by the emperor
          Lothair and his son Louis II, was not consecrated for more than
          two months (Sept. 29). Soon afterward the Saxon king, Ethelwulf,
          and his eon Alfred, visited Rome and made liberal gifts to the
          Church. In his relations with secular powers and important
          prelates, Benedict displayed the same unbending principle which
          was carried out by his famous successor [44]Nicholas I, already
          a person of much influence. He confirmed the powerful Hincmar,
          archbishop of Reims, in his primacy, only on condition that the
          rights of the apostolic see should be safeguarded. In England he
          protested against the deposition of bishops by tyrannous lay
          nobles. The struggle with the Eastern Church in which Nicholas
          was involved had its origin in Benedict's pontificate, arising
          out of the case of the archbishop of Syracuse, who was deposed
          by the patriarch of Constantinople, [45]Ignatius, and appealed
          to Leo IV and after his death to Benedict. Before Ignatius was
          expelled by a faction and replaced by the famous Photius,
          Benedict died (Apr. 7, 858).

          Benedict IV: Pope 900-903. Owing to the scantiness of the
          sources for the history of the papacy at this period, the
          chronology is very uncertain; the exact date of Benedict's
          elevation can not be determined, though it is probably May, not
          later than June, 900. Like his predecessor, John IX, he
          recognized [46]Formosus, by whom he was himself ordained priest,
          as a lawful pope at a Roman synod in August. When Louis of
          Burgundy (Louis III) made his victorious descent into Italy and
          wrested it from Berengar, Benedict crowned him as emperor in
          Feb., 901. He died in July or Aug., 903.

          Benedict V (called Grammaticus): Pope 964. At the end of 963,
          the emperor Otto I deposed the dissolute John XII in a synod at
          Rome and caused a prominent Roman layman to be put in his place
          as Leo VIII, taking an oath of the people that they would
          thenceforth choose no pope without his consent and that of his
          son. He had scarcely left the city when John XII returned and
          drove out and anathematized Leo. The emperor came back to
          chastise this rebellion, but before he arrived John XII died
          (May 14, 964). A deputation met Otto and begged him not to
          replace Leo, but to permit a new election. In spite of his
          refusal, the Romans chose the cardinal deacon Benedict, a man of
          blameless life and great learning who had been one of the
          opponents of John's unworthy rule. He had pledged fidelity both
          to Otto and to Leo, but the fear of imperial domination of the
          Church had brought him to support John on the latter's return.
          The people were firm in their intention to defend Benedict
          against the emperor; but the pressure of famine forced them to
          give him up (June 23, 964). He was brought to trial before a
          synod. After asking the pardon of Otto and of Leo, and
          surrendering the insignia of his office to the latter, he was
          deprived of his episcopal and priestly functions, though allowed
          to retain those of deacon. To avoid any possibility of his
          changing his mind, he was sent to Germany, where he remained
          practically a prisoner, in the charge of the archbishop of
          Hamburg, until his death, which occurred not earlier than July
          4, 966.

          Benedict VI: Pope 972-974. He was elected immediately after the
          death of John XIII (Sept. 6, 972), but was not consecrated until
          the 19th of the following January, apparently waiting for the
          emperor Otto's confirmation. After the death of Otto I, the
          affairs of the empire fell into disorder. Crescentius, the son
          of Theodore, conspired with the deacon Boniface to overthrow
          Benedict, who was imprisoned and, after Boniface had assumed the
          papal authority, was strangled in July, 974.

          Benedict VII: Pope 974-983. He was a Roman by birth, said to
          have been a kinsman of the powerful Roman prince and senator
          Alberic. He was bishop of Sutri when, on the flight of Boniface
          VII, he was called to the papal throne, and confirmed by the
          emperor Otto II. As far as we know, his first act was to condemn
          Boniface in a synod at Rome. He displayed a great desire to
          maintain friendly relations with the German prelates; Archbishop
          Willigis of Mainz was appointed papal legate for Germany and
          Gaul, with the right of crowning the German kings. Benedict
          showed his subserviency to the emperor by agreeing to the
          suppression of the bishopric of Merseburg in a synod at Rome
          (Sept. 10, 981), without regard to the arguments brought against
          such a proceeding. He was a devoted friend of monasticism, as is
          shown not only by the numerous privileges bestowed upon
          monasteries, but by the restoration of that of Saints Boniface
          and Alexius on the Aventine and the building of the monastic
          church of Subiaco. He supported the reforming movement,
          condemning simony at a synod in March, 981. That he upheld the
          claim of the papacy to universal jurisdiction may be inferred
          from the fact that he sought to establish relations with places
          as distant as Carthage and Damascus, giving an archbishop once
          more to the North African Church, and appointing the
          metropolitan of Damascus, who had been driven out by the Arabs,
          abbot of St. Boniface. He died in Oct., 983.

          Benedict VIII (Theophylact): Pope 1012-24. He was the son of
          Count Gregory of Tusculum, chosen by his brothers' influence,
          after they had defeated, by force of arms, the Crescentian
          party, who set up another Gregory as antipope (see [47]Gregory
          VI, antipope). Benedict was consecrated Apr. 20, 1012, and
          Gregory fled to the court of Henry II, who, however, recognized
          Benedict, and was rewarded by a promise of coronation in St.
          Peter's. He descended into Italy toward the end of 1013, and was
          crowned, with his wife Cunigunde, in the following February.
          Soon afterward a synod was held in his presence, at which, it is
          said at his suggestion, the Constantinopolitan Creed was made a
          part of the Roman liturgy; after this he left Pope Benedict to
          contend with his numerous enemies--the Crescentian faction, the
          Arabs, and the Greeks. The first he suppressed; the Mohammedan
          invaders, who threatened Italy from Sardinia, were defeated and
          driven out of the island in June, 1016, by the aid of the Pisans
          and Genoese; he supported those who were attempting to free
          southern Italy from the Byzantine rule, and gained them the help
          of a body of Norman knights, who conquered the Greeks, though
          only temporarily. He accepted Henry's invitation to meet him in
          1020 at Bamberg, where the emperor renewed the "Ottonian
          privilege" to the Church, and gave up Bamberg to ecclesiastical
          rule. In the following year Henry crossed the Alps for the third
          time; Benedict met him at Benevento in 1022, and was present
          when he conquered the Greek fortress of Troja and broke the
          power of Pandulf IV of Capua, an ally of the Byzantines. These
          successes, again temporary, are less important than the synod
          held by the pope and emperor jointly at Pavia Aug. 1, 1022. Here
          Henry's reforming plans were extended to Italy. After a strong
          exhortation from the pope, the synod renewed the condemnation of
          clerical marriage and took measures to prevent the alienation of
          church property. Henry wished to carry his reforms into France
          also, and with this purpose met King Robert at Ivois in Aug.,
          1023. Another synod at Pavia was projected, but before it could
          be held both Benedict and Henry had died, the former Apr. 9,
          1024.

          Benedict IX (Theophylact): Pope 1033-48. He was the son of Count
          Alberic of Tusculum, and nephew of Benedict VIII and John XIX,
          the latter of whom he succeeded by his father's intrigues and
          violence, though he was only ten years old. His life was
          incredibly scandalous, and the strife of factions continued. A
          murderous assault upon him and his expulsion from Rome followed
          (the date can not be determined). He owed his restoration to the
          emperor Conrad II, who came into Italy in the winter of 1036.
          Benedict met him obsequiously at Cremona in the following June,
          taking no notice of the fact that he had broken the Church's
          laws by imprisoning Aribert, archbishop of Milan, and expelling
          the bishops of Piacenza, Cremona, and Vercelli from their sees;
          in fact, in Mar., 1038, he went so far as to excommunicate
          Aribert. By similar complaisances he won the favor of Conrad's
          successor, Henry III, for whom, in 1041, he obligingly
          excommunicated the Hungarian nobles, who had driven out their
          king, Peter. The Romans bore with these conditions until the end
          of 1044, when they rose and drove Benedict out, afterward
          electing John, bishop of Sabina, in his stead, under the title
          of Sylvester III. Benedict succeeded in leading John back to
          Sabina inside of two months; but, doubting his own ability to
          maintain his position, he decided to abdicate, adding one more
          shameless act of simony by selling the papacy (May 1,1045) to
          the archpriest John Gratian (who called himself [48]Gregory VI)
          for the sum of a thousand pounds of silver and the continued
          enjoyment of the Peter's pence from England. Henry III came to
          Italy in the autumn of 1046, and decided to remove Gregory. He
          convened a synod at Sutri, which deposed Sylvester even from the
          priesthood and induced Gregory to resign his claims (Dec. 20,
          1046); a few days later, another synod in Rome deposed Benedict
          also, and Suidger of Bamberg succeeded to an undisputed papacy
          as Clement II. When he died, however, nine months later,
          Benedict made an attempt to recover his see. He was soon put
          down by the imperial authority, and retired to Tusculum. When
          and where he died is not known.

          Benedict X (Johannes Mincius): Pope 1058-59. He was bishop of
          Velletri before, unwillingly, he was elected and enthroned in
          the night between Apr. 3 and 4, 1058, by the noble factions
          which had so long dominated the papacy and were soon to lose
          their power. Peter Damian and the other reforming cardinals
          fled; but before they left Rome they pronounced an anathema upon
          the new pope. Meantime Hildebrand was on his way back from
          Germany. At Florence he heard the news, and after conferring
          with the empress Agnes, regent for her son Henry IV, arranged
          for the election of a pope acceptable to the strict churchmen.
          At Sienna in December Gerard, bishop of Florence, was chosen and
          took the title of Nicholas II. In January he held a synod at
          Sutri which pronounced the deposition and excommunication of
          Benedict X. The latter was driven from Rome by the forces set in
          motion by Hildebrand, and finally found it expedient to
          abdicate, which he did formally at a synod in the Lateran, Apr.,
          1060. He is said to have lived twenty years longer as a prisoner
          in the monastery of St. Agnes. Gregory VII, in whose reign he
          died, permitted him to be buried with the obsequies of a
          rightful pope, as which, indeed, he was reckoned until the
          fourteenth century.

          Benedict XI (Niccolo Bocasini): Pope 1303-1304. He was born in
          1240 at Treviso, entered the Dominican order in 1254, and spent
          fourteen years in diligent study, which enabled him to write
          several Biblical commentaries. He became prior of his house,
          provincial of Lombardy, and in 1296 general of the order.
          Boniface VIII made him a cardinal priest in 1298, and soon after
          cardinal bishop of Ostia and Velletri. In 1302 he went to
          Hungary as papal legate. He remained true to Boniface VIII, and
          on his death was elected (Oct. 22, 1303) to succeed him. He
          found himself at once in difficulties as the heir to the policy
          and the enemies of Boniface (see [49]Boniface VIII), but by a
          conciliatory prudence he found his way out of them. First he won
          back the powerful Colonna family, restoring to them their
          dignities and possessions under certain limitations which marked
          his sense of their misconduct. Frederick of Sicily was brought
          to a sense of his feudal obligations toward the papacy, which he
          had thought to escape. To Tuscany, Benedict sent Nicholas of
          Prato, his successor as cardinal bishop of Ostia, to make peace
          between the Bianchi and Neri factions in Florence. This mission
          was not very successful, but Benedict had better fortune with
          the most difficult task left to him by his predecessor, the
          effecting of a reconciliation with France. Philip the Fair was
          ready for peace, but apparently made the condition that a
          general council should be called to pass a post-mortem
          condemnation on Boniface. Benedict met him half way, and on Mar.
          25, 1304, released him from his excommunication; then he
          annulled a number of other measures of his predecessor which had
          been specially felt as grievances in France, and on May 13
          withdrew the sentences passed against Philip and his counselors,
          even those who had taken part in the outrage of Anagni, with the
          exception of the ringleader William of Nogaret. He, together
          with all the Italians who had taken part in the violence offered
          to Boniface, was excommunicated on June 7, and summoned to
          appear before Benedict to receive sentence. A few weeks later,
          however (July 7), Benedict died in Perugia, whither he had
          retired on account of turbulence in Rome. The rumor immediately
          spread that he had been poisoned, at the instigation, it was
          variously asserted, of Philip the Fair, of the Colonna, of the
          Franciscans (who were jealous of the favor shown to the
          Dominicans), of the opposition cardinals, or of William of
          Nogaret, who had most to gain by a change, and who, in fact,
          received his absolution from Benedict's successor.

          Benedict XII (Jacques Fournier): Pope 1334-1342. He was a native
          of Languedoc, of humble origin, and as a boy entered the
          Cistercian monastery of Bolbonne in the diocese of Mirepoix,
          migrating later to that of Fontfroide in the diocese of
          Narbonne, of which his uncle was abbot. The latter sent him to
          the University of Paris. Pope John XXII gave him the bishopric
          of Pamiers and later of Mirepoix, and made him cardinal in 1327.
          He was rather unexpectedly elected pope Dec. 20, 1334, and began
          his reign with reforming measures. The bishops and abbots who
          lingered at the court of Avignon were sent home, the system of
          petitions was regulated, and care was taken to select worthy men
          for vacant benefices. Benedict planned to restore the strict
          discipline of the Benedictines and Cistercians, as well as of
          the mendicant orders, and entirely avoided the reproach of
          nepotism. Soon after his elevation, the Romans begged him to
          return to them, and he promised to do so, but was prevented by
          the French majority in the Sacred College. Later he thought of
          removing to Bologna, but finally settled down in Avignon and
          began the building of a magnificent palace. His attitude toward
          theological and ecclesiastical controversies was a pacific one.
          He condemned the opinion so strongly held by his predecessor,
          that the souls of the just do not enjoy the Beatific Vision
          until after the last judgment. Negotiations took place with the
          Eastern Church looking toward reunion; in 1339 the emperor
          Andronicus sent ambassadors to Avignon, really with a view to
          gaining military aid against the Turks, but holding out
          prospects of ecclesiastical accommodation, which, however, came
          to little. He won a moral triumph in Spain by inducing Alfonso
          XI of Castile to break off his adulterous connection with
          Eleonora de Gusman, and rendered no slight service to the
          Christian cause in the peninsula by making peace between Castile
          and Portugal, and thus enabling the Christian forces to unite
          against the Mussulmans and to defeat them completely at Tarifa.
          The most difficult problem was the treatment of Louis of
          Bavaria. Benedict showed himself conciliatory, and Louis sent an
          embassy to Avignon (1335); but Philip VI, against whose
          interests this reconciliation would have been, prevented it
          then, and a second time in the autumn of the following year.
          This gave the alliance of Louis to Edward III of England against
          France. The electoral princes finally asserted their rights; on
          July 15,1338, they swore to defend the customs and liberties of
          the empire and to prevent any infringement of their electoral
          prerogative; the next day they declared that the king of the
          Romans chosen by them stood in no need of papal confirmation,
          and notified Benedict of their attitude. At the diet held in
          Frankfort (Aug. 8, 1338), Louis went even further, denying any
          connection between the coronation by the pope and the right to
          bear the title of emperor, at the same time asserting the
          invalidity of all the censures pronounced against himself and
          the empire by John XXII. None the less, in the following year he
          reopened negotiations with Benedict; and when he had an
          opportunity of concluding peace with Philip VI, he deserted his
          English ally, hoping to gain Philip's support with the pope. He
          spoiled his own case, however, by his encroachments on the
          Church's law of marriage and its power in such matters. In order
          to marry his son, Louis, margrave of Brandenburg, to Margaret,
          heiress of the Tyrol, he declared her previous marriage with
          Prince John of Bohemia null and void (following an opinion of
          Occam's), and on Feb. 10, 1342, in spite of the impediment of
          consanguinity in the third degree between the couple, had the
          marriage performed. Benedict had no opportunity to pass judgment
          upon these acts, as he died on Apr. 25 of the same year.

          Benedict XIII: 1. The title was first borne by Pedro de Luna
          from 1394 to 1417, in the Great Western Schism. He came of a
          noble family in Aragon, studied in France, taught canon law at
          the University of Montpellier, and was made cardinal by Gregory
          XI.

    Sides with Clement VII in the Great Schism.

          When the schism broke out between the partizans of Urban VI and
          Clement VII, he took the latter's side, and went to Spain and
          Portugal as Clement's representative in 1379. In 1393, again, he
          appeared at a meeting of English and French dignitaries, in the
          hope of winning England away from the party of Boniface IX, the
          pope elected in Rome to succeed Urban VI. When the University of
          Paris in 1394 suggested three ways to end the schism--the
          resignation of both claimants, the submission of both to the
          decision of a tribunal agreed upon between them, or the calling
          of a general council--Clement sent him to Paris to prevent the
          choice of the first; but in fact he declared in favor of it,
          possibly with an eye to his own chances. Clement died the same
          autumn, and the cardinals of his party nearly all agreed that
          whichever of them might be chosen pope should do all in his
          power to end the schism, even by abdicating if necessary; and no
          voice was louder in this agreement than Pedro de Luna's. He was
          unanimously chosen on Sept. 28, consecrated and crowned Oct. 11.
          He reiterated his willingness to do anything for peace; but when
          the next year an embassy representing the king of France, a
          national synod, and the University of Paris approached him to
          urge the abdication of both popes, he declined, recommending
          rather a personal meeting of both to discuss the question. To
          this he adhered in spite of the opposite view of all his
          cardinals but one and of the personal entreaties of the dukes of
          Berry, Burgundy, and Orleans. Charles VI held a second national
          council at Paris (end of Aug., 1398), and tried to gain the
          support of the European sovereigns for his plan. In June, 1397,
          the ambassadors of France, England, and Castile pressed the
          necessity of abdication upon Benedict, who declined for himself
          while recommending it to Boniface IX. No more success attended a
          joint embassy (1398) from Charles and Wenceslaus, king of the
          Romans, headed by Pierre d'Ailly, bishop of Cambrai.

    Course of Events in France.

          Charles held a third council in May, 1398, which decided that
          France should withdraw from Benedict's obedience. When this
          decision received the royal assent and was promulgated (July
          27), all the cardinals but three forsook Benedict, and open
          warfare broke out. Benedict, practically a prisoner in his
          palace, yielded so far (Apr., 1399) as to sign a solemn
          undertaking to abdicate whenever his rival would do the same or
          should die or be expelled from Rome; but he secretly protested
          that his promise was null and void, as having been given under
          compulsion. France was now practically without a pope; and the
          longer this anomalous condition continued, the more uneasiness
          it caused. Leading churchmen, such as Gerson and Nicholas de
          Clémanges, began to write in favor of a return to Benedict XIII.
          Finally Charles called a meeting of bishops and nobles (May,
          1403), to reconsider the question. Before they met Benedict had
          contrived to escape from Avignon, and the city had declared for
          him, once he was free. It is not surprising, therefore, that the
          assembled magnates declared for a restoration of France to his
          obedience, though on condition that he should renew his promise
          in regard to abdication, and undertake to submit the question
          how to end the schism to a general council within a year. This
          left things much as they had been in 1394 and 1395. Boniface IX
          died soon after (Oct. 1, 1404); but his successor, Innocent VII,
          showed just as little inclination to abandon his claims.
          Benedict, still attached to his own plan of a personal
          conference, undertook a journey to Genoa, without any result
          except to produce fresh irritation in France, whose clergy were
          taxed to pay the expenses of the experiment. Another national
          council (1406) declared in favor of withdrawing his right to
          present the bishoprics and benefices; but the Duke of Orléans
          stood out for complete obedience and hindered the execution of
          this decision. New hopes were aroused, on the death of Innocent
          VII, by the choice (Nov. 30, 1406) of Gregory XII, who at once
          declared himself willing to take any measures, even that of
          abdication, to end the schism. A meeting was planned between the
          rivals for the autumn of 1407, but it fell through. In November
          Benedict lost a powerful friend by the murder of the Duke of
          Orléans, and was so unwise in 1408 as to attempt to enforce the
          observance of the French obedience by threats of
          excommunication. In May Charles proclaimed France absolutely
          neutral in the contest. Benedict, fearing for his safety, fled
          to his native Aragon.

    The Councils of Pisa and Constance.

          The cardinals of both factions deserted their respective popes
          and in June took counsel together with a view to calling a
          general council. This met in 1409 at Pisa, summoned both
          claimants before it, proceeded to hear testimony when they did
          not appear, and on June 5 declared both, as heretics,
          schismatics, and perjurers, not only deposed but excommunicated.
          Benedict still asserted his claims, and Spain, Portugal, and
          Scotland adhered to him. New negotiations with him were
          undertaken by the Council of Constance in 1414, but he
          stubbornly refused to yield, even to the persuasions of the
          emperor Sigismund. Finally the patience of his own supporters in
          Spain and Scotland was worn out, and they renounced him in the
          Concordat of Narbonne (Dec., 1415). He entrenched himself in the
          mountain fastness of Peñiscola, near Valencia, which belonged to
          his family, and proudly told the envoys of the council that the
          true Church was there only. On July 28, 1417, the Council of
          Constance once more deposed and excommunicated him; and he
          remained in his castle, with a court of but four cardinals,
          until his death at the age of nearly ninety in Nov., 1424.

          (A. Hauck.)

          2. Benedict XIII was also the name borne by Pietro Francesco
          d'Orsini-Gravina, pope 1724-30. He was born Feb. 2, 1649, at
          Gravina in the kingdom of Naples, and in 1867, renouncing his
          rights of succession to the ducal estates, entered the Dominican
          order at Venice, taking the name of Vincenzo Maria. He studied
          theology at Venice and Bologna, philosophy at Naples. In 1672 be
          was made a cardinal by Clement X, and archbishop of Benevento in
          1686. After administering his diocese admirably for thirty-eight
          years, and spending his leisure in the composition of
          theological works, he was almost unanimously elected pope (May
          29, 1724), after the death of Innocent XIII. At first he took
          the name of Benedict XIV, but changed it to Benedict XIII in the
          conviction that Pedro de Luna was a schismatic and not a
          legitimate pope. His pontificate began with an attempt to
          restrain the pomp and luxury of the cardinals, which was as vain
          as his similar attempts to reform the rest of the clergy. Though
          the prescriptions of the Lateran council of 1725 in this
          direction were not much heeded, it is memorable because in it
          Benedict confirmed the constitution Unigenitus, and thus aided
          the Jesuits. He had the satisfaction of receiving in 1728 the
          unconditional submission of De Noailles, archbishop of Paris,
          the head of the Gallican opposition. Weakness was the principal
          characteristic of his dealings with the secular powers of
          Europe. He left such matters almost entirely in the hands of his
          favorite Cardinal Coscia, whose interest it was to keep on good
          terms with the powers. Thus the emperor Charles VI obtained the
          privileges which he claimed in Sicily as the successor of the
          older rulers, who had been legati nati of the Holy See. Thus
          also the king of Sardinia got the best of a long contest with
          Rome; and only one state found the curia stubborn. The king of
          Portugal, John V, requested the red hat for Bichi, the papal
          nuncio at Lisbon, and when it was refused showed great hostility
          to the pope, even threatening in 1728 to break off all relations
          between the Church of Portugal and Rome, Benedict was unpopular
          in Rome, owing to the misgovernment of Coscia, who, when the
          pope died (Feb. 21, 1730), was obliged to flee in disguise, and
          later was imprisoned for ten years by Clement XII.

          Benedict XIV (Prospero Lorenzo Lambertini): Pope 1740-58. He was
          born [Mar. 31] 1675 at Bologna; at thirteen he entered the
          Collegium Clementinum at Rome, and after studies in theology and
          philosophy, took up the law, practising as advocate of the
          consistory, and as promotor fidei, in which office he laid the
          foundations of his famous work on beatification and
          canonization. Clement XI and Innocent XIII gave him several
          Roman dignities; Benedict XIII made him archbishop of Ancona
          (1727) and cardinal (1728); in 1731 Clement XII transferred him
          to the more important see of Bologna, where he found time to
          write his works on the mass, on the festivals, and Quæstiones
          canonicæ. After the death of Clement XII the conclave was at a
          deadlock for six months between the French, Austrian, and
          Spanish factions, and finally agreed on Lambertini as a
          compromise candidate (Aug. 17, 1740).

    Friendly Relations with Other Rulers.

          Benedict was a man of great learning and piety, and did much for
          the welfare of the Pontifical States, by the promotion of
          agriculture, commerce, and manufactures and by a decrease in
          taxation. His expressed principle that in him "the pope must
          take precedence of the temporal ruler" was carried out both in
          the strenuous efforts which he made to raise the tone of the
          clergy and in his efforts to remove all the misunderstandings
          which had existed between the curia and the European powers,
          even at the cost of considerable concessions. He was not able
          entirely to remove the antagonism between the eighteenth-century
          spirit and religion, but he composed more than one difference
          temporarily. Thus he appeased John V of Portugal by the
          privilege of enjoying the revenues of vacant bishoprics and
          abbeys in his kingdom, as well as by the title of Rex
          fidelissimus. In a concordat with Naples (1741) he went even
          beyond the concessions which Benedict XIII had made, and
          concluded another with the king of Sardinia which was still less
          favorable to the extreme claims of the Church. Still another was
          made with Spain in 1753, which went so far as to allow King
          Ferdinand VI the right of nomination to all the ecclesiastical
          benefices in his kingdom except fifty-two. Friendly relations
          were also maintained with the empire, and strict neutrality
          observed in the war of the Austrian Succession, although the
          contending armies not seldom crossed the boundaries of the Papal
          States. When Albert of Bavaria was elected emperor as Charles
          VII and applied to Benedict for confirmation, he gave him his
          hearty good wishes, but refused at first to recognize his
          successor, Francis I, who had neglected to observe this
          formality. He abandoned his opposition, however, and became an
          active ally of Austria in the contest with Venice over Aquileia.
          As a compromise measure, he finally divided the patriarchate
          into two dioceses, that of Görz, which was to be Austrian, and
          that of Udine, Venetian. Though he refused to confirm the
          guaranties which the landgrave of Hesse-Cassel, on becoming a
          Roman Catholic, was obliged to give for the preservation of the
          rights of his evangelical subjects, Benedict showed none of the
          temper of a persecutor, and had friendly personal relations with
          many Protestants. He was the first pope to concede the title of
          king of Prussia to the ruler whom the curia had previously
          styled margrave of Brandenburg; and he yielded to Frederick the
          Great's wishes so far as to allow the bishop of Brealau to
          decide all Catholic causes in Prussia, appeals to the pope being
          forbidden. In the Gallican controversy he took a wise and
          tolerant part, reversing a decision of De Beaumont, the
          archbishop of Paris, which made formal assent to the
          constitution Unigenitus a condition for receiving the
          sacraments; in an encyclical of Oct. 16, 1756, he laid down the
          rule that the ministrations of the Church should be refused only
          to those who had publicly contemned the bull.

    The Jesuits.

          Benedict's conciliatory temper made him little likely to
          sympathize with the Jesuits, with whom he dealt at the very
          beginning of his reign in a way that did not please them,
          deciding against them, in the controversy over the "Chinese
          rites," the question how far the principles of Christianity
          might be accommodated for the purpose of making more speedy
          conversions among the heathen, in two bulls--the Ex quo
          singulari of 1742, and the Omnium sollicitudinum of 1744 (see
          [50]Accomodation, § 9). Though he was no partizan of the
          Jesuits, it was not until shortly before his death that he
          undertook (1758) the long-planned reform of the order, at least
          in Portugal, entrusting its execution to Saldanha, the patriarch
          of Lisbon.

          In 1750 Benedict celebrated a jubilee with great pomp, and
          invited the Protestants also to attend--naturally with no other
          result than to call out a number of polemical replies. To the
          end of his life he found his chief diversion in the company of
          learned men, of whom a circle assembled round him once a week.
          During his pontificate he composed his most important work, De
          synodo diæcesana. He had a catalogue of the Vatican library
          drawn up by the learned Assemani, founded societies for the
          study of Roman and Christian antiquities and of church history,
          and cooperated in the foundation of the archeological academy
          with Winckelmann, who came to Rome in 1755. He died as he had
          lived, with cheerful, goodhumored words upon his lips, May 3,
          1758.

   Benedict of Aniane
          BENEDICT OF ANIANE: The reformer of the Benedictine order in the
          Frankish empire. He was born about 750 in his father's county of
          Maguelone in Languedoc; d. at Inden (13 m. n.e. of
          Aix-la-Chapelle) Feb. 11, 821. His youth was spent at the court
          of Pepin and of Charlemagne, where, as a page, he had
          opportunity to distinguish himself in feats of arms. During
          Charles's first Lombard campaign, Benedict rescued his brother
          from drowning at the risk of his own life, and the shock brought
          to a head the resolve which had been slowly forming in him, to
          renounce the world and give himself to the service of God in the
          monastic life. This he entered in 773 at Saint-Seine in the
          diocese of Langres. Returning home in 779, he built a small
          monastery on his own land near the little river Aniane (where
          the town of Aniane, 16 m. w.n.w. of Montpellier, later grew up),
          which was replaced by a larger one lower down when the number of
          his disciples increased, and by a third still larger about 792.
          This became the center of Benedict's efforts for the reformation
          of the monastic life in the south and southwest of France. King
          Louis of Aquitaine, who had favored him from the outset,
          entrusted him with the oversight of all the monasteries within
          his territory, and the greatest churchmen, such as Alcuin and
          Leidrad of Lyons, sought his counsel. He had a wide knowledge of
          patristic literature, and forwarded the cause of education with
          zeal. He stood out as a champion of the orthodox faith against
          [51]Adoptionism, and wrote two treatises against it, the first
          of which is specially interesting as showing how close was the
          practical connection between Adoptionism and Arianism. His
          influence became still wider with the accession of Louis the
          Pious, who first brought him up to the Alsatian abbey of
          Maurmünster, and then, to have him nearer at hand, founded
          another for him at Inden, giving him the general oversight of
          all the monasteries in the empire. He could now hope to
          accomplish his great purpose of restoring the primitive
          strictness of the monastic observance wherever it had been
          relaxed or exchanged for the less exacting canonical life. This
          purpose was clearly seen in the capitularies drawn up by an
          assembly of abbots and monks at Aix-la-Chapelle in 817, and
          enforced by Louis's order throughout the empire.

          Benedict's chief works are compilations of the older ascetic
          literature. The first of them is called by his biographer, Ardo,
          Liber ex regulis diversorum patrum collectus; an enlarged
          edition of this was prepared by Lucas Holsten (published at Rome
          only after Holsten's death, in 1661, with the title Codex
          regularum). The other work, called Concordia regularum by
          Benedict himself, is based on the first; in it the sections of
          the Benedictine rule (except ix-xvi) are given in their order,
          with parallel passages from the other rules included in the
          Liber regularum, so as to show the agreement of principles and
          thus to enhance the respect due to the Benedictine. The
          Concordia was first published in 1638 by H. Menard of the
          Congregation of St. Maur, with valuable notes (reprinted in MPL,
          ciii). A third collection of homilies, to be read daily in the
          monasteries, has not been definitely identified. Benedict's
          place is in the second rank of the men who made the reigns of
          Charles and Louis glorious. He had not the breadth of view
          possessed by Charlemagne himself or by Adalhard nor the lofty
          endeavor for a fusion of secular and spiritual learning of
          Paulus Diaconus and Alcuin. He was primarily an ecclesiastic,
          who zealously placed his not inconsiderable theological learning
          at the service of orthodoxy, but gave the best thing he had, the
          loving fervor of an upright Christian soul, to the cause of
          Benedictine monasticism.

   Benedict Biscop
          BENEDICT BISCOP: First abbot of Wearmouth and Jarrow; b. of
          noble family about 628; d. at Wearmouth (on the north side of
          the Wear, opposite Sunderland, Durhamshire) Jan. 12, 689 or 690.
          Biscop was his Saxon name, his ecclesiastical name was Benedict,
          and he was also called Baducing as a patronymic. He was a thane
          and favorite of [52]Oswy, king of Nothumbria, but in 653 decided
          to abandon the world and went to Rome. He became a monk at the
          monastery of Lerins about 665, and was appointed by Pope
          Vitalian to conduct [53]Theodore of Tarsus to Canterbury in 668.
          In 674 be began to build the monastery of St. Peter at Wearmouth
          on land given by Egfrid, king of Northumbria. In 681 or 682 he
          founded the sister house, dedicated to St. Paul, at Jarrow (5 m.
          farther north, on the south bank of the Tyne). He made six
          visits to Rome, learned the Roman ecclesiastical usages and the
          rules of monastic life, and strove faithfully to introduce them
          in England; he also brought back a rich store of books,
          vestments, pictures, and the like. He induced John, the
          archchanter of St. Peter's at Rome, to accompany him to England
          and instruct his monks; and he brought skilled workmen from Gaul
          to build his monasteries, including the first glass-makers in
          England.

  I. The Life of Benedict.

    1. The Life of Benedict by Gregory the Great.

          The only early authority on the life of Benedict, since the Vita
          Placidi has been admitted to be untrustworthy ever since
          Mabillon, and the worthlessness of the Vita sancti Maori has
          been recently demonstrated by Malnory, is practically the single
          biography written by Gregory the Great. But the expectations
          aroused by a life written only fifty years after Benedict's
          death by so distinguished an author are disappointed when he is
          found, in the spirit of his time, exalting the greatness of his
          hero by the number and importance of his miracles. This tendency
          has gone so far that Grützmacher is inclined to see nothing
          actually historical in all this mass of legendary details except
          the names of the places where Benedict lived and worked, and the
          names of his disciples. But this is going somewhat too far;
          Gregory expressly names four abbots, themselves among these
          disciples and one of them (Honoratus) still living at Subiaco,
          as witnesses to the truth of his story; and the tradition must
          have been still full and clear among the monks who had migrated
          from Monte Cassino to the Lateran when he wrote.

    2. Early Life.

          According, then, to what is left of Gregory's account after
          removal of the legendary halo around the saint's head, Benedict
          came of a considerable family in the "province of Nursia," in
          the Umbrian Apennines, and was born toward the end of the fifth
          century. He received at Rome the education of his day, which,
          however, did not mean much acquaintance with the Roman classical
          authors, and seems to have included no Greek. Shocked by the
          immorality around him, he left both the school and his father's
          house for a life of solitary mortification. His first permanent
          abode was a cave by the Anio, not far from Subiaco, where a
          monk, Romanus, provided him with the rough monastic garb and
          with scanty nourishment. Here Benedict spent three years of
          stubborn conflict with his lower nature, until the spreading of
          his fame by shepherds brought his solitude to an end. The monks
          of a neighboring monastery (perhaps at Vicovaro), whose head had
          just died, begged him to come and rule them. He accepted with
          reluctance, probably foreseeing what actually happened when he
          attempted strictly to enforce their rule. When their
          insubordination went as far as an attempt to poison him, he
          discovered the plot and gently rebuked them, then retired to his
          beloved cave. Here, as new disciples came around him, he
          established twelve small communities, each with twelve inmates
          and a "father" at their head.

    3. Monte Cassino.

          Gregory does not say how long Benedict remained in the
          neighborhood of Subiaco as director of these pious groups; but
          the tradition of Monte Cassino ascribes his migration thither to
          the opposition of a jealous cleric named Florentius, and places
          it in 529. The new place was about halfway between Rome and
          Naples, the Castrum Casinum of the Romans, who had had a
          military colony there. On the summit of the mountain (now Monte
          San Germano), which had been dedicated to the worship of Apollo
          by a population still largely pagan, Benedict built two chapels,
          under the invocation of St. John Baptist and St. Martin, and
          then laid the foundations of the monastery which was to have
          such a long and renowned history. Though Gregory does not say so
          definitely, the traditional view may be accepted that he soon
          drew up his rule, the mature outcome of his experience in
          guiding and governing aspirants to the monastic life of
          perfection. The disturbances of the time, the ware between the
          Goths and the Byzantine empire from 534, probably helped to
          increase the numbers of those who sought a peaceful shelter at
          Monte Cassino; and a daughter house was established at
          Terracina. In the summer of 542; Totila, king of the Goths, on
          his way through Campania, desired to see the famous abbot.
          Gregory relates that, to test his prophetic powers, the king
          sent one of his officers in royal array to Benedict, who
          perceived the deception instantly, and, when the young king
          knelt before him, told him that he should enter Rome, cross the
          seas, and reign nine years--which came to pass. Gregory mentions
          Benedict's sister, Scholastica, in connection with the last
          meeting between the two in a house near the monastery; she had
          been dedicated to the service of God from her earliest youth.
          The date of Benedict's death can not be determined from any of
          the authorities. His body was buried near Scholastica's in the
          chapel of St. John Baptist, and, according to Paulus Diaconus,
          was translated about a century later to the monastery of Fleury
          on the Loire.

  II. The Rule of Benedict:

    1. General Characteristics.

          Especially since the celebration of the fourteen-hundredth
          anniversary of Benedict's birth in 1880, his rule has been made
          the subject of thoroughgoing studies, and it is everywhere
          recognized as a code which corresponded admirably to its purpose
          of regulating the common life of the western monks. In the
          concluding passage of the prologue, probably added later by
          Benedict, occur the words "Constituenda est ergo a nobis
          dominici schola servitii." Under the later empire, the word
          shola was commonly employed to designate the body of guards in
          the imperial palace under the magister officii; thence the name
          passed to the garrisons of provincial towns, and was used
          sometimes for other bodies or associations existing in them. As
          these military organizations would have a definite code of
          regulations, so it was natural for Benedict (called "magister"
          in the first line of the prologue) to lay down a rule that
          should serve for all who were enlisted in the spiritual army
          ("servitium dominicum")--priests or laymen, rich or poor. It
          separated the monks more absolutely from the world than Basil or
          Cassian had done. Besides the requirements of poverty, silence,
          and chastity, others appear for the first time; that of
          "stability" or a permanent residence in one monastery as opposed
          to the wandering life of the earlier monks, and a specially
          designated habit. The aim of this life is complete surrender to
          the will of God, accomplished through entire obedience to the
          abbot and the rule. The abbot thus appears as an absolute ruler,
          responsible to God alone. It is true that in weighty matters he
          is to seek the counsel of the brethren, but the ultimate
          decision rests with him. Benedict seems to have hesitated in
          placing a præpositus or prior next to him as assistant and, if
          need were, representative.

    2. Moderation.

          In laying down the system of daily prayer, Benedict departed
          somewhat from the earlier practise by instituting the office of
          compline as the seventh of the canonical hours. The longest and
          fullest of all the offices was the nocturna vigilia (matins),
          recited at two o'clock. The day hours were much shorter--lauds
          at daybreak, not long after matins; prime; terce, with which at
          least on Sundays and festivals the Eucharist was connected;
          sext; none; vespers; and compline. One of the principles on
          which the system of devotion was laid out was the weekly
          recitation of the entire Psalter. When this is compared with the
          requirement by Columban of the recitation of the whole 150
          Psalms in the night office of Saturday and Sunday, a second
          principle is perceived which governed Benedict not merely in the
          arrangement of the devotional exercises but in all his rule--a
          wise moderation and gentleness. It appears especially in the
          regulations for meals, of which he allows two daily, except at
          times of fasting; it comes out in the rules for labor, which
          show consideration for the weaker brethren, and also in the
          system of punishment. Small offenses, as unpunctuality at meals
          or office, are to be punished without harshness; more serious
          ones call for two private warnings and one in public, after
          which the offender is cut off from the society of the brethren
          at meals and prayers. If he is still obstinate, corporal
          punishment is the next step, and finally, if the prayers of the
          brethren have no effect, he is to be expelled from the
          monastery. Penitents may be twice taken back, but on a third
          lapse there is no further possibility of restoration.

    3. Organization and Direction of the Monastic Life.

          The fact that, in his provision for the clothing of the monks,
          Benedict took account of the conditions of more than one
          province has been made a ground for disputing the authenticity
          of the rule; but the climatic difference between the
          hill-country of his first settlement and the Campanian plain on
          the banks of the Liris is sufficiently notable to find some
          reflection in the rule. Benedict had lived as an anchorite and
          as a cenobite, in convents of varying size and in different
          parts of Italy, at the head of a single small house and of a
          whole group of houses. When, therefore, with this manifold
          experience of what suited the monastic life of his time, he drew
          up a rule for every part of it, in such a definite legislative
          shape as none of his predecessors--Basil, Cassian, Pachomius,
          Jerome, Augustine--had given their prescriptions, we may well
          believe that he was acting to a certain extent with the
          consciousness that he was giving to Italian monasticism a new
          form, stronger and more consistent than had been known before.
          This is the special importance of Benedict's work, both for the
          Church and for the world at large. About the time when the Roman
          See, vindicating and even increasing its independence of Arian
          kings and Byzantine emperors, was preparing to erect its
          universal empire on the ruins of the old, the monk appeared who
          knew how to apply the old Roman talents of legislation and
          organization to the growing but as yet incoherent monasticism.
          Thus he became the founder of the great Benedictine Order which
          for centuries concentrated in itself the extraordinary spiritual
          force of the technically "religious" life, and contributed in so
          marked a degree to the extension of the Western Church. The
          striking influence of the order would, however, be inexplicable
          if it had not early become the guardian of learning and
          literature. The rule required the brothers, in addition to their
          manual labor, to devote one or two hours daily to reading; it
          provided for a convent library from which the monks were to take
          certain books for study at appointed times; each brother was to
          have his tablet and stylus; Benedict himself undertook the
          education of the children of prominent Romans; and in at least
          one passage of the rule those who can not read are spoken of as
          an inferior class. All these things speak of learned and
          literary interests as belonging to the original foundation.
          Cassiodorus even goes further than Benedict, in whose lifetime
          probably he founded the double convent of Squillace, providing
          expressly for the study of classical literature--though it is
          impossible to determine how far this influenced the Benedictine
          Order after the infusion with it of Cassiodorus's monasteries.

  III. The Earlier History of the Benedictine Order:

    1. Period of Growth to the Time of Charlemagne.

          The history of the early extension of Benedict's society is only
          scantily told. According to the traditions of Monte Cassino, the
          third abbot, Simplicius, achieved great success in this work.
          Under the fifth, Bonitus, the mother house was destroyed in 589
          by the Lombards, the monks fleeing to Rome (the universal refuge
          of those days), carrying with them the copy of the rule written
          by Benedict's own hand. There was probably already a monastery
          there which followed this rule--that of St. Andrew, founded by
          the future Pope Gregory the Great in 575; but Gregory's
          attachment to the order was presumably increased by the coming
          of the fugitives, who settled in a place given them at the
          Lateran by Pope Pelagius. The mission of Augustine to the
          Anglo-Saxons from the monastery of St. Andrew in 598 (see
          [54]Anglo-Saxons, Conversion of the) opened a new field to the
          order. The Latin rules of the Spanish bishops Isidore of Seville
          (d. 636) and Fructuosus of Bragara show distinct traces of an
          acquaintance with that of Benedict. But more important was its
          introduction into the Frankish kingdom in the first half of the
          seventh century, since the attempt was there made to submit to
          it the entire monastic body. However it was introduced, it soon
          become predominant, and took the place of the rules of Columban
          and Cæsarius. At a Burgundian synod of 670 it was designated,
          with the canons, as the only standard for monasteries; and
          similarly in the synods held under the auspices of Carloman and
          Boniface in 742 and 743 it is called the norm for convents both
          of monks and of nuns. The language of the capitularies of 811,
          implying that only obscure traces of the prior existence of
          other rules remained, shows how completely it had occupied the
          field by the time of Charlemagne.

    2. Period of Decline.

          In spite, however, of this supremacy, and of the glory reflected
          on the order by such men as Aldhelm and Bede, Alcuin and Paulus
          Diaconus, an acute observer could already perceive traces of
          decay. In some places the abbots abused the power given them by
          the rule; in others laxity had begun to creep in. There was thus
          room for the reforming activity of [55]Benedict of Aniane, who
          attempted not only to restore the pristine strictness, but to
          supplement the rule by special ordinances for the purpose of
          securing uniformity in the daily life of the Frankish
          monasteries. His success, powerfully seconded as he was by the
          emperor Louis the Pious, was not lasting. The ninth century saw
          a considerable number of new foundations, especially in Saxony,
          and the literary activity promoted by Charlemagne continued; but
          there were many complaints not only of the giving of monasteries
          to laymen but of decay in morality and strict monastic
          discipline. In addition to these things, grievous havoc was
          wrought in many different quarters by the irruptions of the
          barbarians--in England by the Danes, in northern Germany and
          France by the Normans, in the south of Germany and the north of
          Italy by the Huns, and on the Mediterranean coast by the
          Saracens.

          (Otto Seebass.)

  IV. The History of the Order Since the Ninth Century:

    1. 821-1200. Ecumenical Activity. New Congregations.

          The palmy days of the order, from Benedict of Aniane to Innocent
          III (821-1200) may be designated as the time of ecumenical
          activity. The family of monks which proceeded from Monte Cassino
          controlled with its influence the civilization of the entire
          Christian West. The Basilian monasteries of South Italy and
          Sicily, as well as the monks and hermits of the Celtic Church in
          the British isles, were able only for a time to maintain the
          independence of their institutions. Patronized and at the same
          time monopolized by Rome, the Benedictine monastic character
          made itself the standard of monasticism throughout Latin
          Christendom. True, from the ninth century on there were marked
          departures from the founder's ideal, in consequence of which,
          even after the reform by [56]Benedict of Aniane, a number of
          similar efforts at reform became necessary; but the call to
          return to the original vigor of the rule ever proved its
          purifying power, and the total influence of the order was rather
          enhanced than decreased by the growing number of these reform
          congregations. The most important of them after the tenth
          century was the reform of Cluny (from 910), with which were
          gradually blended more or less the smaller reforms of a like
          tendency originating almost simultaneously in Flanders under
          Gerard of Brogne (d. 959), in Lorraine under John of Gorze (d.
          974), in England under Dunstan of Glastonbury (d. 988), from the
          monastery of St. Benignus at Dijon (c. 990) under William of
          Volpiano (d. 1031) and in southern Italy by Alferius of Cava (d.
          1050) (See [57]Cluny, Abbey and Congregation of; [58]John of
          Gorze; [59]Gerard, Saint, 1; [60]Dunstan). More independent of
          the Benedictine institutions, though proceeding from the order,
          were some reforming movements of the eleventh century. Among
          these were the famous congregation of [61]Hirschau, c. 1060,
          which was distinguished by the rigor of its discipline; that of
          Vallombrosa (see [62]Gualberto, Giovanni), 1038, which, like
          Hirschau, developed with especial care the institution of lay
          brothers (fratres conversi), thus setting an, important example
          for later orders (see [63]Monasticism); those of Camaldoli,
          1000; Grammont, 1076; Fontévraud, c. 1100; (see
          [64]Camaldolites; [65]Grammont, Order of; [66]Fontévraud, Order
          of); and finally that of Cîteaux,1098. The last of these
          reforms, the ripest and noblest fruit of the older Benedictine
          ideal, grew so rapidly, and, especially under the influence of
          St. Bernard, showed such power in the field of missionary and
          civilizing effort that it was obliged to leave the Benedictine
          family and form, not a new congregation but a new order, in
          spite of its adherence to the fundamental form of monastic
          discipline as delineated in the Regula Benedicti (see
          [67]Cistercians). By this separation of the youngest daughter
          from the mother, the latter ceased to be regarded as the only
          normal type for western monasticism. The ecumenical period of
          Benedictine history ends with the last decades of the twelfth
          century. It must thenceforth be traced as the history of one
          order among several in the life of western civilization.

    2. 1200-1563. Decay and Attempts at Reform.

          The period from Innocent III to the Council of Trent (1200-1563)
          is a time of increasing inner decay and of futile efforts at
          reform. The first attempt to restore discipline in the
          monasteries of the order, which had become very worldly, was
          made in 1215 by the Fourth Lateran Council under Innocent III.
          It ordered that every three years a general chapter should be
          held, and that the visitations prescribed by this chapter should
          be made by Cistercian abbots. Under this regulation the
          archbishops of Canterbury and York introduced the triennial
          visitations into the Benedictine monasteries of England, and
          enforced them in repeated provincial councils. For the
          monasteries of the Continent, special importance attached to the
          edict of Benedict XII, himself a Cistercian, who, after
          introducing a stricter discipline into his own order (1335),
          issued in the following year an edict concerning the
          Benedictines. This constitution, known as Summa Magistri or
          Constitutio Benedictina, decrees that in each monastery a
          general chapter is to be held annually. For each of the
          thirty-six provinces into which the order is divided by it,
          triennial provincial chapters are prescribed. But in spite of
          this measure, which had a temporarily beneficial effect,
          spirituality constantly declined. The reforms introduced
          afterward by the Council of Constance (1415), by a provincial
          chapter of the Mainz province of the order held at Petershausen
          (1417), by the congregation of [68]Bursfelde organized for the
          North-German territories of the order, as well as by many
          Spanish congregations (e.g., the Observance of Valladolid under
          Ferdinand the Catholic, 1493), brought about merely a temporary
          improvement in the conditions.

    3. 1563-1800. Tridentine Reform. New Congregations.

          The Tridentine reforming period (1563-1800) was introduced by
          the decree De regularibus et monialibus passed in the
          twenty-fifth session of the [69]Council of Trent (Dec. 3, 1563),
          which opposes the mischievous excess of exemptions, puts the
          female members of the order without exception and the male
          members for the most part under the supervision of the bishops,
          and insists upon strict observance of the older regulations
          concerning the holding of general chapters, visitations, etc.
          Several new Benedictine congregations sprang up under the
          influence of the Tridentine decrees; in South Germany one for
          Swabia (1564), one at Strasburg (1601), one at Salzburg (1641),
          one for Bavaria (1684); in Flanders the congregation of St.
          Vedast near Arras, founded about 1590; in Lorraine that of St.
          Vanne and St. Hydulph, which Abbot Didier de la Cour founded in
          1600 and Pope Clement VIII confirmed in 1604. An outgrowth of
          the latter was the congregation of St. Maur, founded in 1618
          under the direction of the same Abbot Didier, which spread all
          over France, attaining the number of 180 monasteries, and raised
          the work of the order in the direction of learning to a
          prosperity which it never had before (see [70]St. Maur,
          Congregation of). But after about 1780, first the forcible
          secularization under Joseph II, and then the storm of the
          Revolution in France and the neighboring countries to the south
          brought about the ruin of the order.

    4. The Nineteenth Century.

          The epoch of restoration, which coincides with the nineteenth
          century, has been able to save only about 500 houses (with about
          4,300 monks), out of the 37,000 houses (abbeys or priories)
          which the order numbered before the catastrophes of the
          eighteenth century. Yet in some of the congregations there is at
          present a healthy and vigorous life as far as the morals and
          discipline are concerned and also as to achievements in
          theological learning and Christian art (painting, sculpture,
          etc.). In the latter respect the South German congregation of
          Beuron is especially distinguished. The two other South-German
          congregations (the Bavarian and the Swabian) and those of
          northern France and Belgium (especially in the monasteries of
          Solesmes and Maredsous) have recently produced some able
          scholars and theologians. The Benedictines of the mother house
          of the order at [71]Monte Cassino and the American congregations
          connected with it have also rendered considerable services in
          the same lines.

   Benediction
          BENEDICTION: In the Roman Catholic Church a part of every
          liturgical act, belonging to the class of
          [73]sacramentals--i.e., things which were instituted, not by
          Christ but by the hierarchic Church with divine authority, and
          which are supposed, is their application to persons and things,
          to communicate quasi ex opera operato through ordained priests
          the grace of God insisting in purification, supernatural
          revivification, and sanctification. The higher the hierarchical
          position of him who bestows the blessing, the more powerful it
          is. Benediction and exorcism are always connected; the latter
          breaks demoniac influences and drives away the demons, while the
          former communicates divine powers, not only positively, but also
          negatively in the way of purification, by blotting out sins of
          omission and the temporal punishment of sins, and removing
          satanic influences, thus having itself a sort of exorcism though
          not explicit. Where exorcism alone takes place, it is in an
          imperative manner, whereas the benediction is precative, yet
          with an effective divine power quasi ex opere operato by means
          of the sign of the cross. The personal benediction effects
          either a lasting habitus (e.g., anointing at baptism), or a
          forma gratiæ actualis for a passing object and condition (e.g.,
          benediction for travelers, and the sick); both kinds work either
          in the main negatively by the removal of satanic influences or
          positively in illumination and bestowal of supernatural strength
          in body and soul. Benedictions of things are always primarily
          negative, and positive only in the second place, that the use
          and enjoyment of the objects may conduce to the welfare of man's
          body and soul. The supernatural powers are attached to the
          things by means of the benediction, and in their effect they are
          independent of the conduct of man; either they make the things
          permanently res sacræ, affecting men in a purifying and
          sanctifying manner (baptismal water, holy water, rosaries,
          etc.), or they are of transient effect as conveying God's grace
          and protection. Some times they are also connected with
          indulgences. If anointing is applied, the benediction becomes a
          consecration, whereby the thing is dedicated to the service of
          God (e.g., monstrances, crosses, pictures, flags, organs, etc.).

          As to the Evangelical conception of the benedictions, the words
          of Johann Gerhard give the proper point of view: "The priests
          [in the Old Testament] blessed by praying for good things; God
          blessed by bestowing the good things. Their blessing was votive,
          his effective. God promises to confirm this sacerdotal blessing
          on condition that it is given according to his word and will."
          Thus it is only God who effectively blesses; that is,
          communicates divine powers of his grace and his spirit; all
          human blessing is only intercession with God for his blessing.
          [According to the Roman Catholic view, the objective difference
          between liturgical and extraliturgical, ecclesiastical and
          private benediction is that in the former the efficacy emanates
          from the Church as a body by whose authority the rite was
          instituted and in whom name it is conferred and, in consequence,
          is supposed to be greater than in the latter where the effect
          depends on the intercession of an individual.] According to the
          Evangelical idea, there exists no objective difference between
          liturgical and extraliturgical, ecclesiastical and private
          benediction; it is only in a psychological way that the former
          may be more efficacious for the fulfilment of the subjective
          conditions of the hearing of prayer. Again, only persons, not
          things, can be blessed with God's spirit and grace. If things
          are nevertheless blessed, it means that they are set apart for
          ritual use; and so long as they are thus employed, they will be
          sacred, while they are desecrated when used lightly apart from
          ritual purposes. The benediction of things takes place only by
          metonymy; the things are mentioned, but the persona are meant
          who use them. Thus, e.g., a cemetery is dedicated to its special
          use and handed over to the reverential protection of the living;
          a church edifice is dedicated by its being used and offered to
          the living congregation as a valuable religious possession
          because of its use. But the Roman Catholic traditions still in
          many ways influence the ideas held even among Protestants on the
          subject of benediction.

          Provisions Affecting Benefices (§ 3).

          Appointment to a Benefice (§ 4).

          Tenure (§ 6).

    1. Meaning of the Term.

          Benefice (beneficium ecclesiasticum) is a term which includes
          two meanings: the spiritual, relating to the ecclesiastical
          duties attached to it; and the temporal, relating to the income
          and other worldly advantages of the office. The latter is more
          strictly the meaning of the word, though the connection of the
          two was early recognized in the phrase beneficium datur propter
          officium. Indeed, the term beneficium is not generally used
          where there is only the temporal side, with no corresponding
          duties. Such a case may be a commenda, whose holder has a right
          to the revenues of a church without any responsibilities; or a
          præstimonium, which is a charge for support on the revenues of
          the church; or a pensio, the use of a part of the revenues.
          These relations, however, when they are permanent fall under the
          general rules applicable to benefices. The benefice proper is
          ordinarily permanent, though sometimes founded for a specified
          time.

    2. Remuneration of Clergy.

          Historically in the primitive Church all the property of a
          diocese formed one whole, administered by the bishop; its
          purpose was primarily the support of the poor--bishop and clergy
          lived as belonging to that class, and were supposed, if they had
          no private means, to support themselves by their own labors.
          Those who had no other means of support received a monthly
          stipend from the general fund. With the recognition of the
          Church under Constantine, and the consequent accession of
          considerable property and state subventions, the system changed.
          But in law the episcopal church was still the unit in any
          consideration of diocesan property, and the bishop still its
          exclusive custodian. This remained the case when church property
          was divided into three or into four parts (see [74]Church
          Building, Taxation for) and one part destined for the support of
          the clergy. While, however, it was long before the theory
          changed, in practise there was a tendency to decentralization,
          and the individual parishes began to be recognized as separate
          units. This arose largely from donations and endowments destined
          by the donor for a particular church, whose clergy were to be
          supported out of their returns. After the fifth century it
          became customary for the bishops, instead of paying their clergy
          out of a central fund, to assign pieces of land for their
          support and that of the poor and of public worship. These
          assignments became gradually irrevocable, and thus finally the
          diocesan unity was dissolved, and the separate churches came
          into permanent possession of these properties.

    3. Provisions Affecting Benefices.

          The intimate connection between officium and beneficium is shown
          by a review of the provisions affecting benefices. They are
          divided into regular and secular, according as they are served
          by monastic or secular clergy; into beneficia curata, those to
          which the cure of souls is attached, and non curata, such as
          those of chaplains, canons of cathedrals, and the like. The
          Council of Trent forbade changing a beneficium curatum into a
          non curatum or simplex. The erection or constitution of a
          benefice, the permanent attachment of certain revenues to the
          performance of certain duties, was held to be reserved to the
          ecclesiastical authorities. The foundation of bishoprics was
          originally a function of provincial synods, but later came to
          the pope, who also had power alone to found collegiate churches.
          The bishop has power to found other benefices within his
          diocese, and his officials decide whether the endowment is
          sufficient and whether the proposed foundation will be useful
          and not injure any other party. The founder has certain rights
          of imposing conditions for the tenure of his benefice, which,
          once confirmed, are perpetual.

    4. Appointment to a Benefice.

          The appointment to a benefice (provisio, institutio canonica)
          includes the choice of the person (designatio) and the
          conferring of the benefice (collatio, concessio, institutio in
          the narrower sense). The designation to the greater benefices
          (bishoprics and the like) is sometimes by election, sometimes by
          nomination of the sovereign; to the lesser, by the choice of the
          bishop, frequently on the nomination of a patron. The collation
          is the act of ecclesiastical superiors--of the pope to
          bishoprics (confirmatio), of the bishop to the lesser benefices.

          The conditions of a proper canonical appointment to a benefice
          are several: (1) A vacancy must exist, and that a real one, not
          such as would be caused by the forcible expulsion of the
          incumbent. Thus [75]expectancies are forbidden; but the election
          of a coadjutor-bishop cum jure successionis is allowed. (2) The
          person appointed must be a persona regularis and idonea, i.e.,
          properly qualified to hold the benefice. Under this head comes
          the possession of the qualifications necessary for
          [76]ordination, though, where it is required, a delay of a year
          or other specified time may be granted. Intellectual
          qualifications are included, to be determined, according to the
          Council of Trent, by examination; and the law has sometimes
          required native birth also, other things being equal. (3) The
          appointment must be made within the legal time, the rule being
          that no benefice shall remain vacant more than six months;
          otherwise the right of presentation is lost (see [77]Devolution,
          Law of). (4) There must be no simony involved. (5) What are
          called subreption and obreption are also forbidden; this affects
          especially cases where a person obtains a benefice without
          letting it be known that he already holds another. The church
          law forbids plurality of benefices, except, for example, in
          cases where a beneficium simplex is held concurrently with a
          beneficium curatum, these being held to be compatible. This rule
          was often violated by papal dispensation, which caused great
          dissatisfaction. (6) The proper forms, both in the designation
          and in the collation, must be observed (see [78]Bishop;
          [79]Investiture; etc.).

    5. Rights of a Benefice.

          The rights and duties connected with a benefice are partly
          matters of universal law, partly special to the particular case.
          The incumbent has a right to the usufruct of any property
          belonging to the benefice, tithes, fees, oblations, etc. All
          this is his absolutely; but the view that he ought only to use
          so much of it as will suffice for his support, devoting the rest
          to ecclesiastical purposes and especially to the poor,
          influenced legislation very early, so that what came from the
          Church was supposed to revert to the Church, if it had not been
          used, at the cleric's death. This rule, which at one time was
          positive, has been very much relaxed, within certain limits. Of
          course the incumbent's power over church property is limited by
          the rights of his successor, arid no arrangements can be made
          lasting beyond his lifetime, unless by the concurrence of the
          proper authorities.

    6. Tenure.

          A benefice is supposed to be conferred for life, and is normally
          vacated only by the death of the incumbent, but it may be
          vacated earlier by resignation, either express or tacit.
          Resignation can not be arbitrary with the incumbent, as he has
          by his acceptance of it incurred certain obligations from which
          he must be released--bishops by the pope, the lower clergy by
          their bishops. There must also be a valid ground for it. Tacit
          resignation may come about through any act which ipso facto
          dissolves the relationship: the taking monastic vows by the
          holder of a beneficium sæculare, the acceptance of a secular
          office, marriage (see [80]Celibacy), the acceptance of another
          incompatible benefice, change of faith, etc. Vacation as a
          penalty may occur through deprivation or remotion; this includes
          the transfer of a priest, as a disciplinary measure, to a
          smaller charge.

          The technical use of the word benefice in Protestant Churches is
          largely confined to the Church of England where a great part of
          the prescriptions given above is still in force. In the statute
          law of England the term is practically restricted to a benefice
          with cure of souls, as distinct from cathedral preferment. In
          the State Churches of Germany also the distinction between
          beneficium and officium is still maintained, and the erection
          and alteration of benefices is a matter concerning jointly the
          ecclesiastical and secular authorities. Here the ordinary
          collator to a benefice is the consistory. The tendency of the
          most modern legislation is toward giving the congregation a
          voice in the selection of the pastor.

   Beneficium Competentiæ
          BENEFICIUM COMPETENTIÆ: The privilege by which a condemned
          debtor is allowed to retain so much of his income as is
          absolutely necessary to his maintenance. Such a privilege exists
          in many places, in the interest of the public service, for
          officials and also for clerics. For the latter the custom is
          usually referred to the decree of Gregory IX (1271-76) De
          solutionibus (iii, 23). This passage, however, only establishes
          the principle that an unbeneficed clerical debtor can not be
          forced to pay by spiritual penalties, and that the creditors are
          to be content with sufficient security for payment when the
          debtor's circumstances improve. The glosses, and common practice
          following them, base the privilege upon the decree, and statute
          law has confirmed it, restricting any levy upon the salary or
          other income of such a cleric so that a certain sum is left to
          him as congrua (sustentatio). This privilege can not be pleaded
          in the case of debts arising from unlawful transactions or of
          public taxes.

          (E. Friedberg.)

   Benefit of Clergy
          BENEFIT OF CLERGY: A privilege claimed by the medieval Church;
          as part of its general plea of immunity from secular
          interference. It allowed members of the clergy to have their
          trial for offenses with which they were charged, not before any
          secular tribunal, but in the bishop's court. In England this
          covered practically all cases of felony except treason against
          the king, and by the reign of Henry II it had given rise to
          great abusers. In many cases grossly criminal acts of clerics
          escaped unpunished, and other criminals eluded the penalty of
          their acts by declaring themselves clerics. The question was one
          of those on which the quarrel between the king and Becket
          reached its acute stage; and by the Constitutions of Clarendon
          (1164; see [81]Becket, Thomas) Henry attempted to deal with it
          by decreeing that clerics accused of crime were to be first
          arraigned in the king's court, which might at its discretion
          send them to an ecclesiastical court. If convicted here and
          degraded (see [82]Degradation), the clerk was to lose his
          benefit of clergy and be amenable to lay justice. Edward III
          extended the privilege in 1330 to include all persons who could
          read (see [83]Clerk); and it was not until the fifteenth century
          that any very definite regulation of this dangerous latitude was
          arrived at. Later statutes guarded against the evasion of their
          provisions by expressly declaring that their operation was
          "without benefit of clergy," and the privilege was finally
          abolished in 1827. There are a few early cases of its use in the
          American colonies, especially the Carolinas and Virginia; but an
          Act of Congress put an end to it here in 1790.

          Quentin, France, Jan. 31, 1714; d. at Philadelphia May 3, 1784.
          He belonged to a Huguenot family which settled in England in
          1715, joined the Quakers there, and came to Philadelphia in
          1731. He was a cooper by trade, but gave his life after coming
          to America to teaching and to philanthropic efforts, against
          slavery and war, in behalf of the American Indians, and the
          total abstinence cause. In 1742 he became English master in the
          Friends' School at Philadelphia and in 1755 established a girls'
          school there. In 1750 he undertook an evening school for slaves.
          He wrote many tracts against the slave trade and printed and
          distributed them at his own expense; he also published A Short
          Account of the People Called Quakers (Philadelphia, 1780); The
          Plainness and Innocent Simplicity of the Christian Religion
          (1782); Some Observations on the Situation, Disposition, and
          Character of the Indian Natives of this Continent (1784).

   Bengel, Johann Albrecht
          BENGEL, JOHANN ALBRECHT: German Lutheran; b. at Winnenden (12 m.
          n.e. of Stuttgart), Württemberg, June 24, 1687; d. at Stuttgart
          Nov. 2, 1752. He studied at Tübingen, and devoted himself
          especially to the sacred text; he was also intent upon
          philosophy, paying particular attention to Spinoza. After a year
          in the ministry as vicar at Metzingen, he became theological
          repetent at Tübingen in 1708; and in 1713 was appointed
          professor at the cloister-school at Denkendorf, a seminary for
          the early training of candidates for the ministry. During this
          year he traveled through Germany, visiting the schools,
          including those of the Jesuits, to learn their methods. At
          Denkendorf he published in 1719 his first work, an edition of
          the Epistolæ Ciceronis ad familiares, with notes; then Gregorii
          panegyricus græce et latine (1722), and Chrysostomi libri vi de
          sacerdotio (1725), to which he added Prodromus Novi Testamenti
          recte cauteque ordinandi. His chief work, however, was upon the
          New Testament. While a student, he was much perplexed by the
          various readings in the text, and with characteristic energy and
          perseverance he immediately began to investigate the subject. He
          procured all the editions, manuscripts, and translations
          possible, and in 1734 published his text and an Apparatus
          criticus, which became the starting-point for modern
          text-criticism of the New Testament. His famous canon was: "The
          more difficult reading is to be preferred." This critical work
          was followed by an exegetical one, Gnomon Novi Testamenti
          (Tübingen, 1742), which has often been reprinted in Latin, and
          was translated into German by C. F. Werner (1853, 3d ed., 1876)
          and into English in Clark's Library (5 vols., Edinburgh,
          1857-58) and in an improved edition by Lewis and Vincent (2
          vols., Philadelphia, 1860-1861). As a brief and suggestive
          commentary on the New Testament, the Gnomon is still of use.

          Bengel's chief principle of interpretation, briefly stated, is
          to read nothing into the Scriptures, but draw everything from
          them, and suffer nothing to remain hidden that is really in
          them. His Gnomon exerted considerable influence on exegesis in
          Germany, and John Wesley translated most of its notes and
          incorporated them into his Annotatory Notes upon the New
          Testament (London, 1755). In 1740 appeared Bengel's Erklärte
          Offenbarung Johannis, often reprinted (Eng. transl. by John
          Robertson, London, 1757); in 1741 his Ordo temporum, and in 1745
          his Cyclus sive de anno magno consideratio. In these
          chronological works he endeavored to fix the "number of the
          beast" and the date of the "millennium," which he placed in the
          year 1836. In 1741 he was made prelate of Herbrechtingen; in
          1749 member of consistory and prelate of Alpirspach, with
          residence at Stuttgart; and two years later Tübingen honored him
          with the doctorate.

          and was honorary canon of Canterbury from 1885. He was also
          rural dean of East City from 1903. In theology he was a
          Broad-church disciple of F. D. Maurice. Died at London July 30,
          1910. His works are: The Gospel of St. Matthew, with Notes and a

   Benjamin of Tudela
          BENJAMIN OF TUDELA (a town of Navarre, on the Ebro, 160 miles
          n.e. of Madrid): Properly Benjamin ben Jonah, a Spanish rabbi,
          who in 1160 (or 1165; cf. Grätz, Geschichte der Juden, vi, note
          10) left home and traveled through Catalonia, southern France,
          Italy, Greece, the islands of the Levant, Syria, Palestine, and
          Mesopotamia to Bagdad; thence he proceeded to Egypt by way of
          Khuzistan, the Indian Ocean, and Yemen; and finally returned to
          Spain in 1173. The information which he gathered with great
          diligence not only concerning the places visited, but also of
          adjoining lands, was written down in a Hebrew work (Massa'oth
          shel rabbi Binyamin, "Itinerary of the Rabbi Benjamin"), which
          is one of the most famous of early books of travel. Benjamin was
          credulous, perhaps deficient in general information, and
          interested primarily in things Jewish; his book abounds in
          errors and absurdities, but it does not, justify the charge of
          deliberate falsification, and it contains much that is true and
          valuable not only concerning the numbers, status, and dispersion
          of the Jews of the twelfth century, but also concerning general
          history, political conditions, trade, descriptions of places,
          and the like.

          Bibliography: The "Itinerary" was first published at
          Constantinople in 1543; then Ferrara, 1558; Freiburg, 1583; and

          the text with a Latin translation, the former at Antwerp, 1575;
          the latter at Leyden, 1633. An English translation (from the
          Latin of Arias Montanus) was published in Purchas's Pilgrims,

   Benno
          BENNO: Bishop of Meissen; b. at Hildesheim or Goslar 1010; d. at
          Meissen June 18, 1108, according to the traditional accounts.
          The first certain fact in his life is that he was a canon of
          Goslar. He was made bishop of Meissen in 1066, and appears as a
          supporter of the Saxon insurrection of 1073, though Lambert of
          Hersfeld and other contemporary authorities attribute little
          weight to his share in it. Henry IV imprisoned him, however, but
          released him in 1078 on his taking an oath of fidelity, which he
          did not keep. He appeared again in the ranks of the king's
          enemies, and was accordingly deprived of his bishopric by the
          Synod of Mainz in 1085. Benno betook himself to Guibert, the
          antipope supported by Henry as Clement III, and by a penitent
          acknowledgment of his offenses obtained from him both absolution
          and a letter of commendation to Henry, on the basis of which he
          was restored to his see. He promised, apparently, to use his
          influence for peace with the Saxons, but again failed to keep
          his promise, returning in 1097 to the papal party and
          recognizing Urban II as the rightful pope. With this he
          disappears from authentic history; there is no evidence to
          support the later stories of his missionary activity and zeal
          for church-building and for ecclesiastical music. His elevation
          to the fame of sainthood seems to have been due partly to the
          need of funds to complete the cathedral of Meissen, and partly
          to the wish to have a local or diocesan saint. He was officially
          canonized by Adrian VI in 1523, as a demonstration against the
          Lutheran movement, which Luther acknowledged by a fierce
          polemical treatise. His relics were solemnly dug up and
          venerated in 1524; but as the Reformation progressed they were
          no longer appreciated in Meissen, and Albert V of Bavaria
          obtained permission to remove them in 1578 to Munich, of which
          city Benno is considered the patron saint.

          Jan. 20,1840; d. at Delft Nov. 15, 1728. His parents were
          servants of the Protestant family La Tremoille. He early
          displayed fondness for the classics, studied at Montaigu College
          and at La Marche (Paris), and taught privately in divinity at
          Montauban. In 1664 he was ordained, and the following year was
          called to Alençon, where he served for twenty years as
          Protestant minister, with as much prudence as capacity. He met
          with much opposition from the Roman Catholics, especially from
          the Jesuit De la Rue, who attacked him and even incited a riot
          against him. After the revocation of the Edict of Nantes,
          Benoist went to Holland, and was called as minister to the
          church of Delft, near The Hague, where he stayed thirty years.
          He wrote Lettre d'un pasteur banni de son pays à une Église qui
          n'a pas fait son devoir dans la dernière persécution (Cologne,
          1666); Histoire et apologie de la retraite des pasteurs à cause

          accompanied Mary Stuart to Scotland as her confessor in 1561;
          after his return to France was appointed pastor of the church of
          St. Eustache in Paris in 1569, and played a conspicuous part in
          the controversies of the Ligue as one of the leaders of the
          opposition to the Guises and the Ultramontanes. In 1566 he
          published a translation of the Bible, which, however, was little
          more than a reprint of the Geneva translation; it has been said
          that he knew little of either Hebrew or Greek. The translation
          was condemned by the theological faculty of the University of
          Paris in 1567 and by Pope Gregory XIII in 1575, and Benoist was
          expelled from the Sorbonne in 1572. He was reinstated by Henry
          IV and, to reenter the faculty, subscribed his own condemnation.
          He exasperated the Ultramontanes still more by maintaining that
          the king did not forfeit his right to the throne by professing
          the Protestant faith. He had influence in bringing about Henry's
          change of faith, and the latter made him his confessor and
          appointed him bishop of Troyes, but the pope refused
          confirmation, and in 1604 he had to renounce the office. He was
          a voluminous writer.

   Benson, Edward White
          BENSON, EDWARD WHITE: Archbishop of Canterbury; b. at Birmingham
          July 14, 1820; d. at Hawarden (6 m. e. of Chester) Oct. 11,
          1896. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A., 1852);
          became master at Rugby 1852; was ordained priest 1857; in 1859
          was appointed first head master of Wellington College (on the
          border of Windsor forest, near Wokingham, Berkshire); was
          appointed examining chaplain by the bishop of Lincoln
          (Christopher Wordsworth) in 1868, prebendary of Lincoln 1869,
          and chancellor and residentiary canon 1872, when he resigned his
          mastership and took up his residence at Lincoln. In 1877 he was
          consecrated first bishop of Truro (Cornwall); and was translated
          to Canterbury in 1883. He was a man of great energy, determined,
          and self-reliant. His industry was unremitting, and he found
          time for reading and study, the fruits of which appeared in the
          posthumous publications Cyprian, his Life, his Times, his Work
          (London, 1897) and The Apocalypse (1899). His administrative
          ability was shown in the development of Wellington College,
          which was practically his creation, and the thorough and
          efficient organization of the new diocese of Truro, where he
          formed a divinity school to train candidates for holy orders,
          began the erection of a cathedral, and founded and strengthened
          schools. He was the first bishop to appoint a canon missioner.
          As archbishop he strove for legislation effecting reforms in
          church patronage and discipline; opposed and prevented the
          disestablishment of the Church of Wales; created, in 1886, a
          body of laymen to act in an advisory capacity with the
          convocation of his province; cultivated cordial relations with
          the Nestorians and other Eastern Christians, but repelled what
          may have been intended as an advance to his own Church from
          Rome. He sat as judge in the trial of Bishop King of Lincoln,
          charged with certain ritual offenses (1889-90), and in the
          judgment which he delivered produced a masterly exposition of
          the law of the prayer-book, based upon the entire history of the
          English Church. Besides the works already mentioned, a volume of
          Prayers, Public and Private appeared posthumously (1899), and he
          published during his lifetime several volumes of sermons and
          addresses.

   Bentley, Richard
          BENTLEY, RICHARD: English theologian and scholar; b. at Oulton,
          near Wakefield (25 m. s.w. of York), Yorkshire, Jan. 27, 1662;
          d. at Cambridge July 14, 1742. He was the son of a blacksmith,
          was grounded in Latin by his mother, studied at the
          grammar-school at Wakefield, and was admitted at the age of
          fourteen (the usual age of matriculation was seventeen or
          eighteen) to St. John's College, Cambridge. He took his first
          degree in 1680 with honor in logic, ethics, natural science, and
          mathematics, and became schoolmaster at Spalding in
          Lincolnshire. But Stillingfleet, the wealthy and learned dean of
          St. Paul's, soon called him to London to superintend his son's
          studies. He took his pupil in later years to Oxford and reveled
          there among the manuscripts in pursuance of his researches in
          profane and especially Biblical literature, entering on his
          life's work of treating and publishing texts. He had taken his
          M.A. at Cambridge in 1684 and received the same degree from
          Oxford probably in 1689. Before his twenty-fourth year he had
          started for himself a hexapla dictionary; in the first column
          stood every Hebrew word in the Bible and in the other five all
          the different translations of these words in Chaldee, Syriac,
          Latin, and Greek (both the Septuagint and Aquila). His Latin
          letter of ninety-eight pages to John Mill appeared in 1691 as an
          appendix to an edition of the chronicle of Malalas and presented
          a mass of critical research, including much drawn from
          manuscripts; he moved over the field of classical literature as
          if it were his library of which he knew every inch, and showed
          himself a master in criticizing the origin of books, in
          following up etymological rules, in explaining their use, and in
          dealing with meter. In this, his virgin effort, he gave
          explanations and corrections for some sixty Greek and Latin
          authors. He wrote like an authority, and in the happiest manner.
          He published Callimachus (1693), Phalaris (1699; the debate is
          still interesting), Menander arid Philemon (1710), Horace
          (1711), Terence (1726), and Manilius (1739); his edition of
          Milton's Paradise Lost appeared in 1732.

          Ordained 1690, probably at once Stillingfleet's house-chaplain,
          he became canon of Worcester in 1692, librarian to the king in
          1694, chaplain in ordinary to the king in 1695, D.D. from
          Cambridge and Master of Trinity in 1699, vice-chancellor of the
          University 1700, archdeacon of Ely 1701. His intrigues secured
          his election as regius professor of theology in 1717. His
          apparent love of power led the academic senate, Oct. 17, 1718,
          to deprive him, illegally, of his academic degrees, which a
          decree of court restored to him in 1724. He was almost always in
          hot water either in literature, in his college, or in politics.
          Legally deprived of his mastership in 1734, he kept it, simply
          because the man who should oust him did not choose to move.

          He delivered the first Boyle lectures (see [85]Boyle, Robert) in
          1692, his intimate friend Isaac Newton helping him. He wrote
          against the freethinker Collins in 1713. Sterne quoted in
          Tristram Shandy his sermon on papistry, 1715. In 1691 he wrote
          to John Mill about the text of the New Testament, in 1713 he
          discussed the readings, and in 1720 he published his proposals
          for a new edition. At least from 1716 on, and apparently as late
          as 1732, he caused collations to be made in the libraries from
          London to Rome. But he did not publish an edition, probably
          because he found it impossible to give what he wished to give.
          His collations are in the library of Trinity College.

          Trinity College, Hartford, Conn. (B.A., 1856) and the General
          Theological Seminary, New York city (1860). He held various
          parishes in North Carolina from 1860 to 1883, when he was
          appointed professor of mathematics and modern languages at
          Delaware College, Newark, Delaware, being transferred to the
          chair of Greek and Latin two years later. In 1887 he accepted a
          call to the University of the South as professor of dogmatic
          theology, where he remained until 1894, being likewise rector of
          the Otey Memorial Church, Sewanee, from 1893 to 1895. He was
          then rector at Albion, Ill., in 1895-1904, this being
          interrupted by a temporary charge at Tarentum, Pa. Since 1905 he
          has held a temporary charge at Foxburg, Pa. His chief literary
          work has been the editing of the Church Encyclopedia
          (Philadelphia, 1884).

          Tübingen (Ph.D., 1888; licentiate of theology, 1894), and after
          a pastorate at Neuenstadt, Württemberg, from 1894 to 1898, was
          privat-docent for Old Testament theology at the University of
          Berlin until 1901, when he retired, and has since resided in
          Palestine. In theology he belongs to the historicocritical
          school. He has been a member of the Deutscher Palästinaverein
          since 1888, editing its journal in 1897-1902, and has also been
          on the executive committee of the Deutscher Verein zur

   Benzo
          BENZO: Bishop of Alba, a zealous partizan of Henry IV; b. about
          the beginning of the eleventh century; d. not earlier than 1085
          or 1086. Little that is definitely attested can be related of
          his life; but it may be reasonably conjectured that he came
          originally from southern Italy, that he gained some sort of a
          position at the German Court, possibly as one of the chaplains
          of Henry III, and that before 1059 he was raised to the
          bishopric of Alba by Henry's influence. He was one of the most
          devoted upholders of the Italian claims of the German kings, and
          a bitter opponent of the Hildebrandine party. His most
          prosperous days fell in the period of the schism between
          Honorius II and Alexander II, when he went to Rome (at the end
          of 1061) charged by the empress Agnes with the mission of
          supporting the former, the imperial candidate for the papacy, to
          whom he remained faithful even after Alexander's supremacy was
          assured. Later, he was a victim of the Patarene movement (see
          [86]Patarenes), when in 1076 or 1077 popular disturbances drove
          him from his see. Ill luck followed him during the rest of his
          life. Though he may have taken part in Henry IV's first
          expedition to Rome, we never again find him in an important
          political position; and the latest indications to be gathered
          from his writings leave the picture of a man broken by poverty
          and illness, and still waiting for the emperor to reward him for
          long and faithful services. His Libri vii ad Henricum IV do not
          make up a single work, but are a collection of separate writings
          in both prose and verse which he put together into a sort of
          mosaic shortly before his death. Their special interest lies in
          the fact that they give an admirable insight into the views of
          the extreme imperialists, who were carried away by boundless
          hatred of Gregory VII. Benzo puts forth original views on the
          constitution of the State and on ecclesiastical politics from
          the standpoint of a convinced supporter of the empire. His
          Panegyricus, since the time and manner of the composition of its
          several books have been definitely determined, is now more
          highly regarded as an authority on the period of the schism.

   Berengar of Poitiers
          BERENGAR OF POITIERS: A younger contemporary and zealous
          adherent of [87]Abelard. Practically nothing is known of his
          life except what may be learned from his few brief writings.
          These, however, are not without interest, partly because (in
          spite of their being by no means completely trustworthy) they
          are among the authorities for the history of the Council of Sens
          in 1141, and partly for the light which they throw on the mental
          attitude and literary tone which prevailed among the disciples
          of Abelard and opponents of Bernard about the middle of the
          twelfth century. There are three of them extant: an Apologeticus
          against Bernard, an Epistola contra Carthusienses, and an
          Epistola ad episcopum Mimatensem, the bishop of Mende. The first
          was written not long after the Council of Sens, but not until
          the sentence of Innocent II against Abelard was known. Toward
          the end of it Berengar points out that other teachers, such as
          Jerome and Hilary of Poitiers, had made mistakes without being
          deposed; but a large part of the tractate is a personal attack
          on Bernard, accusing him of having made frivolous songs in his
          youth, taught the preexistence of the soul, and made up his
          commentary on the Canticles of a lot of heterogeneous material,
          partly borrowed from Ambrose. Especially bitter are his
          accusations of duplicity and unfairness in connection with the
          Council of Sens. The shorter but equally malicious letter
          against the. Carthusians, who had taken a stand against Abelard,
          accuses them of breaking their vow of silence to speak calumny,
          and, while abstaining from the flesh of beasts, devouring their
          fellow men. The third letter is written in a different tone.
          Berengar's boldness had apparently stirred up so much hostility
          that he feared for his safety, left home, and sought an asylum
          in the Cévennes, whence he wrote to beg the bishop's protection,
          not exactly as a penitent, though he implies that he has
          approached more nearly to Bernard's standpoint. Whether he
          succeeded in setting himself right cannot be told, as nothing is
          known of his later life.

  BERENGAR OF TOURS.

          Early Life (§ 1).

          Controversy over the Eucharist (§ 2).

          Berengar Submits at Rome (§ 3).

          Reasserts his Views in France (§ 4).

          Berengar's Significance (§ 5).

    1. Early Life.

          Berengar of Tours was born perhaps at Tours, probably in the
          early years of the eleventh century; d. in the neighboring
          island of St. Cosme Jan. 6, 1088. He laid the foundations of his
          education in the school of Bishop Fulbert of Chartres, who
          represented the traditional theology of the early Middle Ages,
          but did not succeed in imposing it upon his pupil. He was less
          attracted by pure theology than by secular learning, and brought
          away a knowledge of the Latin classics, dialectical cleverness,
          freedom of method, and a general culture surprising for his age.
          Later he paid more attention to the Bible and the Fathers,
          especially Gregory and Augustine; and it is significant that he
          came to formal theology after such preparation. Returning to
          Tours, he became a canon of the cathedral and about 1040 head of
          its school, which he soon raised to a high point of efficiency,
          bringing students from far and near. The fame which he acquired
          sprang as much from his blameless and ascetic life as from the
          success of his teaching. So great was his reputation that a
          number of monks requested him to write a book that should kindle
          their zeal; and his letter to Joscelin, later archbishop of
          Bordeaux, who had asked him to decide a dispute between Bishop
          Isembert of Poitiers and his chapter, is evidence of the
          authority attributed to his judgment. He became archdeacon of
          Angers, and enjoyed the confidence of not a few bishops and of
          the powerful Count Geoffrey of Anjou.

    2. Controversy over the Eucharist.

          Amid this chorus of laudation, however, a discordant voice began
          to be heard; it was asserted that Berengar held heretical views
          on the Eucharist. In fact, he was disposed to reject the
          teaching of Paschasius Radbertus, which dominated his
          contemporaries. The first to take formal notice of this was his
          former fellow student [88]Adelmann, then a teacher at Liége, who
          wrote to question him, and, receiving no answer, wrote again to
          beseech him to abandon his opposition to the Church's teaching.
          Probably in the early part of 1050, Berengar addressed a letter
          to Lanfranc, then prior of Bec, in which he expressed his regret
          that Lanfranc adhered to the eucharistic teaching of Paschasius
          and considered the treatise of [89]Ratramnus on the subject
          (which Berengar supposed to have been written by Scotus Erigena)
          to be heretical. He declared his own agreement with the supposed
          Scotus, and believed himself to be supported by Ambrose, Jerome,
          Augustine, and other authorities. This letter found Lanfranc in
          Rome, after it had been read by several other people; and as
          Berengar was not well thought of there, Lanfranc feared his
          association with him might be prejudicial to his own interests,
          and laid the matter before the pope. The latter excommunicated
          Berengar at a synod after Easter, 1050, and summoned him to
          appear personally at another to be held at Vercelli in
          September. Though disputing the legality of his condemnation, he
          proposed to go, first passing through Paris to obtain permission
          from King Henry I, as nominal abbot of St. Martin at Tours.
          Instead of granting it, however, the king threw him into prison,
          where Berengar occupied himself with the study of the Gospel of
          John, with a view to confirming his views. The synod was held at
          Vercelli without him; two of his friends, who attempted to
          defend him, were shouted down and barely escaped personal
          violence; Ratramnus's book was destroyed; and Berengar was again
          condemned. He obtained his release from prison, probably by the
          influence of Geoffrey of Anjou; but the king still pursued him,
          and called a synod to meet in Paris Oct., 1051. Berengar,
          fearing that its purpose was his destruction, avoided appearing,
          and the king's threats after its session had no effect, since
          Berengar was sheltered by Geoffrey and by Bishop Eusebius Bruno
          of Angers, and found numerous partisans among less prominent
          people.

    3. Berengar Submits at Rome.

          In 1054 Hildebrand came to France as papal legate. At first he
          showed himself friendly to Berengar, and talked of taking him
          back to Rome to get Pope Leo's authority with which to silence
          his foes. But when he found that the latter could do more to
          disturb the peace of the Church than Berengar's friends, he drew
          back. Under these circumstances Berengar decided to concede as
          much as he could, and the French bishops showed that they wished
          a speedy settlement of the controversy, when the Synod of Tours
          declared itself satisfied by Berengar's written declaration that
          the bread and wine after consecration were the Body and Blood of
          Christ. The same desire for peace and the death of Pope Leo were
          reasons why Hildebrand did not press for Berengar's going to
          Rome at once; later he did so, confident of the power of his
          influence there, and accordingly Berengar presented himself in
          Rome in 1059, fortified by a letter of commendation from Count
          Geoffrey to Hildebrand. At a council held in the Lateran, he
          could get no hearing, and a formula representing what seemed to
          him the most carnal view of the sacrament was offered for his
          acceptance. Overwhelmed by the forces against him, he took this
          document in his hand and threw himself on the ground in the
          silence of apparent submission.

    4. Reasserts his Views in France.

          Berengar returned to France full of remorse for this desertion
          of his faith and of bitterness against the pope and his
          opponents; his friends were growing fewer--Geoffrey was dead and
          his successor hostile. Eusebius Bruno was gradually withdrawing
          from him. Rome, however, was disposed to give him a chance;
          Alexander II wrote him an encouraging letter, at the same time
          warning him to give no further offense. He was still firm is his
          convictions, and about 1069 published a treatise in which he
          gave vent to his resentment against Nicholas II and his
          antagonists in the Roman council. Lanfranc answered it, and
          Berengar rejoined. Bishop Raynard Hugo of Langres also wrote a
          treatise De corpore et sanguine Christi against Berengar. But
          the feeling against him in France was growing so hostile that it
          almost came to open violence at the Synod of Poitiers in 1076.
          Hildebrand as pope tried yet to save him; he summoned him once
          more to Rome (1078), and undertook to silence his enemies by
          getting him to assent to a vague formula, something like the one
          which he had signed at Tours. But his enemies were not
          satisfied, and three months later at another synod they forced
          on him a formula which could mean nothing but transubstantiation
          except by utterly indefensible sophistry. He was indiscreet
          enough to claim the sympathy of Gregory VII, who commanded him
          to acknowledge his errors and to pursue them no further.
          Berengar's courage failed him; he confessed that he had erred,
          and was sent home with a protecting letter from the pope, but
          with rage in his heart. Once back in France, he recovered his
          boldness and published his own account of the proceedings in
          Rome, retracting his recantation. The consequence was another
          trial before a synod at Bordeaux (1080), and another forced
          submission. After this he kept silence, retiring to the island
          of Saint-Cosme near Tours to live in ascetic solitude.
          Apparently his convictions were unchanged at his death, and he
          trusted in the mercy of God under what he considered the unjust
          persecutions to which he had been subjected.

    5. Berengar's Significance.

          Berengar's real significance for the development of medieval
          theology lies in the fact that he asserted the rights of
          dialectic in theology more definitely than most of his
          contemporaries. There are propositions in his writings which can
          be understood in a purely rationalistic sense. But it would be
          going quite too far to see in rationalism Berengar's main
          standpoint, to attribute to him the deliberate design of
          subverting all religious authority--Scripture, the Fathers,
          popes, and councils. This would be to ascribe to a man of the
          eleventh century views of which his age knew nothing, which it
          even had no terms to express. The contrast which he sets forth
          is not between reason and revelation, but between rational and
          irrational ways of understanding revelation. He did not
          recognize the right of the prevailing theology to claim his
          assent, because it made irrational assertions; the authorities
          to which he refused to submit were, in his judgment, only human
          authorities. He spoke bitterly and unjustly of popes and
          councils, unable to forgive them for making him untrue to
          himself; but this meant no rejection of the Catholic conception
          of the Church. His opposition was limited to the eucharistic
          doctrine of his time, and he controverted the theory of
          Paschasius not least because he believed it was contrary to
          Scripture and the Fathers, and destructive of the very nature of
          a sacrament.

   Berengoz
          BERENGOZ: Abbot of St. Maximin's at Treves in the twelfth
          century; d. about 1125. In the records of the abbey he is first
          mentioned as abbot in 1107, and for the last time in 1125. The
          register of deaths contains his name against the date of Sept.
          24, without naming the year; but as his successor, Gerhard, was
          installed in 1127, he must have died either in 1125 or 1126. He
          rendered considerable services to the monastery by procuring
          from Henry V the restitution of a number of alienated fiefs,
          and, besides five sermons for saints' days, wrote two larger
          works: three books De laude et inventione sanctæ crucis, and a
          series of discourses De mysterio ligni dominici et de luce
          visibili et invisibili per quam antiqui patres olim meruerunt
          illustrari. In the former he treats of the legend of the
          discovery of the cross of Christ by Helena, the mother of
          Constantine the Great, adducing a large number of Old Testament
          types of the cross. The latter deals with Christ under the
          aspect of the light of the world, shining from the beginning of
          its history. Whether the commentary on the Apocalypse which the
          Benedictines of St. Maur printed as an appendix to the second
          volume of their edition of St. Ambrose, ascribing it to a
          certain Berengaudus, is his or not must remain uncertain.

          the college at Besançon by essays in philology and mythology;
          abandoned this line of study to devote himself to Christian
          apologetics, and polemics against the Encyclopedists. In 1765-68
          he published at Paris Le Déisme réfuté par lui-même (2 vols.)
          and in 1768 the Certitude des preuves du christianisme (2
          vols.), which achieved a great success and called forth replies
          from Voltaire and Anacharsis Cloots. In 1769 followed Apologie
          de la religion chrétienne (2 vols.) against Holbach, in 1771
          Examen du matérialisme (2 vols.), and in 1780 Traité historique

          times been separately edited (latest by Le Noir, 12 vols.,
          1876). As a reward for his services he was made canon of Notre
          Dame in Paris and confessor to the aunts of the king, with a
          pension of 2,000 livres.

   Berkeley, George

  BERKELEY, GEORGE.

          Bishop of Cloyne (in County Cork, about 15 m. e.s.e. of the city
          of Cork); b. probably at Dysert Castle, near Thomastown (90 m.
          s.w. of Dublin), County Kilkenny, Ireland, Mar. 12, 1685; d. at
          Oxford Jan. 14, 1753.

    Berkeley's Philosophy.

          He studied at Trinity College, Dublin (B.A., 1704; M.A. and
          fellow, 1707; B.D. and D.D., 1721), and filled various college
          offices from tutor (1707) to junior dean (1710) and junior Greek
          lecturer (1712). He lived there in an atmosphere "charged with
          the elements of reaction against traditional scholasticism in
          physics and metaphysics." His Commonplace Book (first printed in
          the Oxford ed. of his works, 1871, iv, 419-502) shows how the
          stimulus worked upon a mind naturally inclined to independent
          investigation. Very early he adopted the idea that no existence
          is conceivable, and therefore none is possible, which is not
          either conscious spirit or the ideas (i.e., objects) of which
          such spirit is conscious. Locke had affirmed secondary and
          primary qualities of the material world; the secondary
          qualities, such as color and taste, do not exist apart from
          sensations; primary qualities exist irrespective of our
          knowledge. Berkeley denied this distinction, and held that
          external objects exist only as they are perceived by a subject.
          Thus the mind produces ideas, and these ideas are things. There
          are, however, two classes of ideas: the less regular and
          coherent, arising in the imagination; the more vivid and
          permanent, learned by experience, "imprinted on the senses by
          the Author of nature" which are the real things--a proof for the
          existence of God. According to Berkeley matter is not an
          objective reality but a composition of sensible qualities
          existing in the mind. "No object exists apart from the mind;
          mind is therefore the deepest reality; it is the prius, both in
          thought and existence, if for a moment we assume the popular
          distinction between the two." Berkeley appeared as an author
          with this theory already developed, and from it he never
          wavered. In 1709 he published an Essay toward a New Theory of
          Vision, an examination of visual consciousness to prove that it
          affords no ground for belief in the reality of the objects
          apparently seen. In 1710 appeared a Treatise concerning the
          Principles of Human Knowledge, in which his theory received
          complete exposition.

          Meanwhile Berkeley had taken orders, and, in 1713, he left
          Dublin, went to London, formed many desirable acquaintances, and
          gained an enviable reputation for learning, humility, and piety.
          The same year he published Three Dialogues Between Hylas and
          Philonous (ed. in Religion of Science Library, No. 29, Chicago,
          1901), "the finest specimen in our language of the conduct of
          argument by dialogue." He visited the Continent in 1713-14 and
          again in 1716-20. In 1721 he returned to Ireland, again filled
          college offices at Dublin (divinity lecturer and senior
          lecturer, 1721; Hebrew lecturer, 1722; proctor, 1722), and was
          appointed dean of Dromore (1722) and dean of Derry, "the best
          preferment in Ireland" (1724).

    Berkeley's American Scheme.

          Berkeley now became devoted to a plan of establishing a college
          in the Bermuda Islands, went to London to further the project in
          1724, and in 1725 published A Proposal for the Better Supplying
          of Churches in our Foreign Plantations, and for converting the
          savage Americans to Christianity by a college to be erected in
          the Summer Islands, otherwise called the Isles of Bermuda. By
          his enthusiasm and persuasive powers he won many expressions of
          sympathy, and came to believe that the government would support
          the plan. In Sept., 1728, he sailed for America and landed at
          Newport, R. I., Jan., 1729. Three years of waiting convinced him
          that his hopes were futile, and in Feb., 1732, he returned to
          London. He published immediately Alciphron or the Minute
          Philosopher, the result of his studies in America and probably
          the most famous of his works. It is a powerful refutation of the
          freethinking then popular and fashionable. In 1734 he was made
          bishop of Cloyne, and there he lived, happy in his family and
          beloved for his goodness and benevolence, till 1752, when he
          went to Oxford to end his days with his son, a senior student at
          Christ Church. He kept up his studies after his appointment as
          bishop and published a number of books, including the curious
          Philosophical Reflections, and Inquiries concerning the Virtues
          of Tar-water (1744; three eds. the same year, the second called
          Siris, a Chain of Philosophical Reflections, etc.), in which he
          set forth a revision of his philosophy, and expressed his faith
          in tar-water as a universal medicine, good for man and beast; it
          was the most popular of his works.

          On first coming to America Berkeley bought a farm near Newport
          and built there a house, still standing, which he called
          "Whitehall" after the English palace. The shore is about a mile
          from the house, and a cleft in the rocks is still pointed out as
          a retreat whither he was wont to go and where he wrote much of
          Alciphron. This book is indeed a permanent record of his life at
          Newport, and not a little of its charm is due to this fact. He
          helped found a philosophical society at Newport and preached
          there in Trinity Church, a fine old wooden structure, which is
          still standing. He made at least one convert, the [91]Rev.
          Samuel Johnson, episcopal missionary at Stratford, Conn., and
          afterward first president of Columbia College, New York.
          Attempts to show that he directly influenced the early
          idealistic thought of Jonathan Edwards have not proved
          successful. His American plans and dreams inspired the poem,
          written at uncertain date, which ends with the stanza:

          Westward the course of empire takes its way;

          The four first acts already past,

          A fifth shall close the drama with the day;

          Time's noblest offspring is the last.

   Bern, Disputation of
          BERN, DISPUTATION OF: The decisive point in the contest which
          definitely established the Reformation at Bern. At first the
          movement made slow progress there, as both the character of the
          people and their manner of life rendered them little susceptible
          to new ideas; even after a reforming party arose, for several
          years things continued in an undecided and vacillating
          condition. The somewhat violent and domineering manner in which
          the Roman Catholic authorities attempted to use their victory at
          the Conference of Baden (1526; See [93]Baden, Conference of)
          brought on a crisis which, after the fashion of the time, it was
          attempted to meet by means of a disputation. Some of the
          Reformers invited to participate declined, having in mind the
          result at Baden, and the Roman Catholic dignitaries and
          celebrities generally refused to attend. But a great number of
          delegates and clergy appeared from Switzerland and the South
          German states, including Zwingli, (Ecolampadius, Butzer, Capito,
          Ambrose Blaurer, and others. The opening session was held on
          Jan. 6, 1528, and the discussions lasted from the following day
          till Jan. 26. They were based on ten theses carefully prepared
          by Berthold Haller and Franz Kolb and revised by Zwingli. The
          outcome was that the ten theses were subscribed to by most of
          the clergy of Bern, the mass was done away with, the images were
          quietly removed from the churches, and on Feb. 7 the Reformation
          edict was issued, which gave the theses force of law, annulled
          the power of the bishops, and made the necessary regulations
          concerning the clergy, public worship, church property, etc. The
          majority of the country congregations soon gave in their
          adherence. The influence of the disputation was felt even in
          France, the Netherlands, and England.

          Zurich, 1528, and again in 1608 and 1701; the Ten Theses are

   Bern, Synod of
          BERN, SYNOD OF: The name given to the first Reformed synod at
          Bern (1532). The Reformation was established at Bern by the
          Disputation and the edict of Feb. 7, 1528 (see [94]Bern,
          Disputation of), but much remained to be done in the way of
          consolidation and to finish the building of the new Church. This
          task was entrusted to a general synod, to which all the clergy
          of the land, 220 in number, were invited. It met on Jan. 9-14;
          Capito from Strasburg was the principal figure, and he collected
          the results of the discussion with much care and labor. They
          form a church directory and pastor's manual which is noteworthy,
          even among the monuments of the Reformation time, for its
          apostolic force and unction, its warmth and sincerity, its
          homely simplicity and practical wisdom.

          Basel, 1532, again in 1728 sad 1778. Both the original and a

  I. Life and Far-reaching Activity:

    1. Bernard's Importance.

          St. Bernard of Clairvaux (Bernardus Clarævallis) is one of the
          most prominent personalities of the twelfth century, of the
          entire Middle Ages, and of church history in general. He gave a
          new impulse to monastic life, influenced ecclesiastical affairs
          outside of monasticism in the most effective manner, and
          contributed not a little toward awakening an inner piety in
          large circles. As he knew how to inspire the masses by his
          powerful preaching, so also he understood how to lead individual
          souls by his quiet conversation, to ease the mind, and to
          dominate the will. It was said in his time that the Church had
          had no preacher like him since Gregory the Great; and that this
          was no exaggeration is proved by Bernard's orations, which in
          copiousness of thought and beauty of exposition have few equals.
          Revered by his contemporaries as saint and prophet, his
          writings, which belong to the noblest productions of
          ecclesiastical literature, have secured him also a far-reaching
          influence upon posterity. Praised by Luther and Calvin,
          Bernard's name has retained a good repute among Protestants,
          though he represented many things which the Reformation had to
          oppose.

    2. Early Career. Abbot of Clairvaux.

          Bernard was born at Fontaines (20 m. n.e. of Dijon), France,
          1090; d. at Clairvaux (in the valley of the Aube, 120 m. s.e. of
          Paris) Aug. 20, 1153. He was the third son of the knight Tecelin
          and Aleth, a very pious lady, whose influence decided his
          future. While yet a boy he lost his mother, and, not being
          qualified for military service, he was destined for a learned
          career. He was educated at Chatillon and for a time seemed to be
          influenced by the world (cf. MPL, clxxviii, 1857; Vita, I, iii,
          6). But this period can not have been of long duration; the
          memory of his mother and the impressions of a solitary journey
          called him back, and he resolved quickly and firmly to break
          entirely with the world. He induced some of his brothers,
          relatives, and friends to follow him, and, after spending half a
          year together at Chatillon, they entered the "new monastery" at
          Cîteaux (see [96]Cistercians). In 1115 a daughter monastery was
          founded at Clairvaux and Bernard became abbot. He gave all his
          energies to the foundation of the monastery, and spent himself
          in ascetic practises, which the famous William of Champeaux,
          then bishop of Chalons, checked from time to time (Vita, I, vii,
          31-32). Bernard soon became the spiritual adviser not only of
          his monks but of many who sought his advice and always left
          Clairvaux impressed by the spirit of solemnity and peace which
          seemed to be spread over the place (Vita, I, vii, 33-34). His
          sermons also began to exercise a powerful influence, which was
          increased by his reputation as prophet and worker of miracles
          (Vita, I, x, 46). According to the constitution which the new
          order adopted, Clairvaux became the mother monastery of one of
          the five principal divisions into which the Cistercian community
          was organized, and Bernard soon became the most influential and
          famous personality of the entire order. As early as the
          pontificate of Honorius II (1124-1130) he was one of the most
          prominent men of the Church in France; he enjoyed the favor of
          the papal chancellor Haimeric (Epist., xv), communicated with
          papal legates (Epist., xvi-xix, xxi), and was consulted on
          important ecclesiastical matters. At the Synod of Troyes (1128),
          to which he was called by Cardinal Matthew of Albano, he spoke
          in favor of the Templars, secured their recognition, and is said
          to have outlined the first rule of the order (M. Bouquet,
          Historiens des Gaules et de la France, xiv, Paris, 1806, 232).
          In the controversy which originated in the same year with King
          Louis VI, who was not antagonistic to the Church but jealously
          guarded his own rights, Bernard and his friars defended the
          bishop before the king (Epist., xiv), afterward also before the
          pope (Epist., xlvi, cf. xlvii), though at first unsuccessfully.

    3. Activity for Innocent II and against Anacletus II.

          With the schism of 1130 Bernard enters into the first rank of
          the influential men of his time by espousing from the very
          beginning the cause of Innocent II against Anacletus II. This
          partizanship of Bernard and others was no doubt induced by the
          fear that Anacletus would allow himself to be influenced by
          family interests. On this account they overlooked the illegal
          procedure in the election of Innocent, regarding it as a mere
          violation of formalities, defending it with reasons of doubtful
          value, and emphasizing the personal worth of that pope. At the
          conference which the king held at Étampes with spiritual and
          secular grandees concerning the affair, Bernard seems to have
          taken the part of reporter. He also worked for the pope by
          personal negotiations and by writing (Epist., cxxiv, cxxv). When
          Innocent was unable to maintain his ground at Rome and went to
          France, Bernard was usually at his side. Later, probably in the
          beginning of 1132, he was in Aquitaine, endeavoring to
          counteract the influence of Gerhard of Angoulême upon Count
          William of Poitou, who sided with Anacletus (Vita, II, vi, 36).
          His success here was only temporary (Epist., cxxvii, cxxviii),
          and not until 1135 did Bernard succeed, by resorting to
          stratagem, in changing the mind of the count (Vita, II, vi,
          37-38). When in 1133 Lothair undertook his first campaign
          against Rome, Bernard accompanied the pope from his temporary
          residence in Pisa to Rome, and prevented the reopening of the
          proceedings concerning the rights of the opposing popes (Epist.,
          cxxvi, 8 sqq.). He had previously visited Genoa, animated the
          people by his addresses, and inclined them to an agreement with
          the Pisans, as the pope needed the support of both cities (cf.
          Epist., cxxix, cxxx). It was also Bernard who in the spring of
          1135 induced Frederick of Staufen to submit to the emperor
          (Vita, IV, iii, 14; Otto of Freising, Chron., vii, 19). He then
          went to Italy, where in the beginning of June the Council of
          Pisa was held; according to the Vita (II, ii, 8), everybody
          surrounded him here, so that it looked as if he were not in
          parte sollicitudinis, but in plenitudine potestatis.
          Nevertheless, resolutions were passed at that time regarding
          appeals to the papal see, which could hardly have been to the
          liking of Bernard. After the council he succeeded in inducing
          Milan and other cities of Upper Italy to submit to the pope and
          emperor (Epist., cxxix-cxxxiii, cxxxvii, cxl). In Milan they,
          attempted to elevate him almost with force to the see of St.
          Ambrose (Vita, II, ii-v). During the last campaign of Lothair
          against Rome, Bernard went to Italy for the third time, in 1137;
          he worked there successfully against Anacletus, and after the
          Pentecost of 1138 he finally brought about the submission of his
          successor to Innocent and thus ended the schism (Epist.,
          cccxvii). After this he left Rome. How great Bernard's influence
          in Rome was at this time may be seen from his successful
          opposition to [97]Abelard.

          The ecclesiastico-political affairs of France soon made a new
          claim upon Bernard's attention. The young king, Louis VII, by
          making reckless use of his royal prerogatives, caused friction,
          as when he refused to invest Peter of Lachâtre, whom the chapter
          of Bourges had elected archbishop. The pope consecrated him,
          nevertheless, and thus provoked a conflict which was enhanced by
          the partizanship of Count Theobald of Champagne. After a while
          Bernard was asked to mediate; he faithfully performed this
          difficult task and enjoyed the confidence of the king to the end
          of his life (cf. Epist., ccciv), whereas his relations to the
          pope appear to have been troubled toward the end (Epist.,
          ccxviii; ccxxxi, 3).

    4. The Second Crusade.

          A very unexpected event was the election of Bernard, abbot of
          Aquæ Silviæ near Rome, formerly a monk in Clairvaux, as Pope
          Eugenius III (1145-53). Bernard writes a little later (Epist.,
          ccxxxix) that all who had a cause now came to him; they said
          that he, not Eugenius, was pope. And it is true that he
          exercised a remarkable influence in Rome especially at first,
          but Eugenius did not always follow his counsels and views; he
          had to consider the cardinals who were envious of Bernard. About
          this time Bernard, at the request of Cardinal Alberic of Ostia,
          undertook a journey to Languedoc, where heresy had advanced
          greatly and [98]Henry of Lausanne had a large following.
          Bernard's presence there, especially at Toulouse, was not
          without effect, but to win permanent success continual preaching
          was required. A more important commission was given to him in
          the following year by the pope himself, to preach the crusade.
          At Vezelay, where the king and queen of France took the cross,
          Mar. 21, 1146, Bernard's address was most effective. He then
          traversed the north of France and Flanders, and the officious
          doings of the monk Radulf induced him to go into the regions of
          the Rhine; he succeeded in checking the persecutions of the Jews
          at Mainz, which Radulf had occasioned. His journey along the
          Rhine was accompanied by numerous cures, of which the Vita (vi)
          contains notices in the form of a diary. But he regarded it as
          the wonder of wonders that he succeeded on Christmas day, 1146,
          in influencing King Conrad in favor of the crusade, in the face
          of all political considerations. During the crusade Eugenius
          sought a refuge in France. Bernard accompanied him, and was
          present at the great council in Reims, 1148; in the debates
          against Gilbert of Poitiers (see [99]Gilbert de la Porrée)
          following the council, Bernard appeared as his main opponent;
          but the jealousy of the cardinals brought it about that Gilbert
          escaped unhurt (Vita, III, v, 15; Otto of Freising, De gestis
          Frid., i, 55-57; Hist. pont., viii, MGH, Scrip., xx, 522 sqq.).
          About this time the first unfavorable news of the crusade became
          known, and tidings of its complete failure followed. No one felt
          the blow more keenly than Bernard, who with prophetical
          authority to speak had predicted a favorable issue (De consid.,
          ii, 1). In the last years of his life he had to experience many
          things which caused him sadness. Men with whom he had had a
          lifelong connection died; his relations with Eugenius III were
          sometimes troubled (Epist., cccvi); the frailty and the pains of
          his body increased. But his mental vitality remained active; his
          last work, De consideratione, betrays freshness and unimpaired
          force of mind.

  II. Ecclesiastical and Theological Significance:

    1. Asceticism.

          Bernard's entire life was dominated by the resolution he made
          while a youth. To work out the salvation of his soul, and--which
          meant the same thing to him--to dedicate himself to the service
          of God, was thenceforth the sum of his life. To serve God
          demanded above all a struggle against nature, and in this
          struggle Bernard was in earnest. Sensual temptations he seems to
          have overcome early and completely (Vita, I, iii, 6) and an
          almost virginal purity distinguished him. To suppress sensuality
          in the wider sense of the word, he underwent the hardest
          castigations, but their excess, which undermined his health, he
          afterward checked in others (cf. Vita, I, xii, 60). He always
          remained devoted to a very strict asceticism (Epist., cccxlv;
          Cant., xxx, 10-12; Vita, I, xii, 60), but castigation was to him
          only a means of godliness not godliness itself, which demands of
          man still other things. The new life comes only from the grace
          of God, but it requires the most serious work of one's own
          nature. How much importance Bernard attached to this work, whose
          preliminary condition is a quiet collection of the mind, may be
          learned from the admonitions which he gives on that point to
          Eugenius. That he prefers the contemplative life to the active
          is nothing peculiar in him; and he doubtless had the desire to
          devote himself entirely to it. He may have believed that only
          duty and love impelled him to act. And yet, as he was eminently
          fitted for action, such work was probably also is harmony with
          his inclinations. From his own experience he received the
          strength to work, the thorough education of the personality, by
          which he exercised an almost fascinating power over others; on
          the other hand, his practical activity excited in him a stronger
          desire for contemplation and made it the more fruitful for him
          (De diversis, sermo iii, 3-5).

    2. Study of the Bible.

          Of Bernard's quiet hours, in spite of the many pressing claims
          on him, one part was devoted to study, and his favorite study
          was the Holy Scripture. His knowledge of the Bible was
          remarkable; not only does he often quote Bible-passages, but all
          his orations are impregnated with Biblical references,
          allusions, and phrases, to pay regard to which is often
          essential for the correct understanding. It is true that his
          exegesis did not go beyond the average of his time, yet he
          allows the great fundamental thoughts and vital forms of the
          Holy Scripture to influence him the more. As he was nourished by
          them he also knew in a masterly manner how to bring them near to
          others. All qualities of the great preacher were united in him;
          besides being vitally seized by the grace of God, he had a
          hearty desire to serve his hearers, an impressive knowledge of
          the human heart, and a wealth of thoughts and fascinating
          exposition, which was indeed not free from mannerism. What is
          missing in his sermons is reference to the variety of the
          relations of life, and this is intelligible, because he had
          monks as his hearers.

    3. Grace and Works.

          Religious geniality is the most distinguishing quality in the
          whole disposition of Bernard; his other rich gifts serve it, to
          it is due the impression which he made upon his time, and the
          importance which he obtained in the history of the Church. At
          the same time, Bernard is also a child of his time; above all,
          of the Church of his time, in which his religious life could
          develop without conflict. In this respect Bernard is related not
          to Luther, but to Augustine, and between Augustine and him stand
          Leo I, Nicholas I, and Gregory VII. Thus elements are found in
          Bernard which point to future developments combined with those
          which belong only to the ecclesiastical consciousness of the
          time. Bernard is most deeply permeated by the feeling of owing
          everything to the grace of God, that on the working of God rests
          the beginning and end of the state of salvation, and that we are
          to trust only in his grace, not in our works and merits. From
          the forgiveness of sin proceeds the Christian life (De diversis,
          sermo iii, 1). Faith is the means by which we lay hold of the
          grace of God (In vigil. nativ. domini, v, 5; In Cant., sermo
          xxii, 8; cf. also In Cant., lxvii, 10; In vigil. nat. dom.,
          sermo ii, 4). Man can never be sure of salvation by resting his
          hope upon his own righteousness, for all our works always remain
          imperfect. On the other hand, Bernard does not deny that man can
          and should have merits, but they are only possible through the
          preceding and continually working grace of God; they are gifts
          of God, which again have rewards in the world to come as their
          fruit, but without becoming a cause of self-glory. Before God
          there is no legal claim, but an acquisition for eternity through
          the work of the pious, made possible and directed by God's
          grace.

          A characteristic contrast to these thoughts, which lead man
          again and again to humility, is the excessive glorification
          which Bernard devotes to the saints, above all to the Virgin
          Mary. Though he opposes (Epist., clxxiv) the new doctrine of her
          immaculate conception, he nevertheless uses expressions
          concerning the mother of Jesus which go very far (e.g., In
          nativ. Beat. Virg. Mariæ, v, 7; In assumpt. Beat. Virg. Mariæ,
          i, 4; In adv. dom., ii, 5). The same concerns also other saints
          (e.g., In vigil. Petri et Pauli, §§ 2, 4, and at the end of the
          second oration In transitu B. Malachiæ). But the importance of
          such expression which a Protestant consciousness will never be
          able to adopt is restricted by this, that they are only used on
          special occasions, such as a feast of the saints. Otherwise the
          saints stand in the background, Christ alone stands in the
          foreground.

    4. Bernard's Mysticism.

          Bernard has always been regarded as a main representative of
          Christian mysticism, and his writings have been much used by
          later mystics and were the main source for the Imitatio Christi.
          But just here becomes evident how different the phenomena are
          which are comprised under the name of mysticism. With the
          Neoplatonic-Dionysian mysticism that of Bernard has some points
          of contact, but it differs from it as to its religious
          character. It is known how depreciatingly Luther speaks of the
          Areopagite, but this animadversion does not concern Bernard's
          mysticism. It is not man who soars to divine height, but the
          grace of God in Christ, which first pardons the sin and then
          lifts up to itself the pardoned sinner. On this account the
          whole mysticism of Bernard centers about Christ, the humbled and
          exalted one; it likes to dwell upon his earthly appearance, his
          suffering and death, for it is the "work of redemption" which
          more than anything else is fit to excite love in the redeemed
          (In Cant., xx, 2; De grad. hum. in its first chapters). At the
          same time Bernard perceives that a sensual devotion, as it were,
          to the suffering of Christ is not the goal with which one must
          be satisfied; the thing necessary is rather to be filled with
          the spirit of Christ and through it to become like Christ. By
          Christ's work of redemption the Church has become his bride. To
          it, i.e., to the totality of the redeemed, belongs this name
          first and in a proper sense, to the individual soul only in so
          far as it is a part of the Church (In Cant., xxvii, 6, 7; lxvii;
          lxviii, 4, 11). What it receives from him is in the first place
          mercy and forgiveness of sins, then grace and blessing. The
          climax of grace is the perfect union, but in the earthly life
          this is experienced by the pious at the utmost in single moments
          (De consid., V, ii, 1; De grad. hum., viii; De dilig. Deo, x).
          When Bernard speaks of becoming one with Christ and with God,
          his thought is clothed with Biblical expressions; but that
          Bernard in point of fact does not intend to go beyond the
          meaning of these words can be seen by reading the explanations
          (In Cant., lxxi, 7 sqq.), where the union with God, to which the
          pious soul attains, is most keenly distinguished from a
          consubstantiality, as it exists between Father and Son in the
          Trinity. Bernard is entirely free from pantheistic thoughts, and
          that mysticism does not bring him in opposition to the Church
          his entire ecclesiastical attitude shows.

    5. Doctrine of the Church.

          The Church as organized, with its hierarchy, at whose head
          stands the Roman bishop, as successor of Peter and vicar of
          Christ, is to Bernard the exhibition of the kingdom of Christ on
          earth. On this account it must enjoy perfect autonomy, having a
          right of supervision over everything in Christendom, even over
          princes and states. It even has a right over the worldly sword
          (De consid., IV, 7; cf. Epist., cclvi, 1). Nevertheless Bernard
          is no blind adherent of the views of Gregory VII. In the first
          place Bernard demands a perfect separation between secular and
          spiritual affairs; the secular as such is to be left to the
          secular government, and only for spiritual purposes and in a
          spiritual sense is the pope to have supervision (De consid., i,
          6). But Bernard is also an opponent of the absolute papal power
          in the Church. As certainly as he recognizes the papal authority
          as the highest in the Church, so decidedly does he reprove the
          effort to make it the only one. Even the middle and lower ranks
          of the Church have their right before God. To withdraw the
          bishops from the authority of the archbishops, the abbots from
          the authority of the bishops, that all may become dependent on
          the curia, means to make the Church a monster (De consid., iii,
          8).

    6. Monasticism.

          Notwithstanding Bernard's many-sided activity, he was and
          remained above all things a monk, and would not exchange his
          monachism either for the chair of St. Ambrose or for the primacy
          of Reims. Monachism is to him the ideal of Christianity. He
          acknowledges indeed that true Christianity is also possible
          while living in the world (Apol., iii, 6; In Cant., lxvi, 3; De
          div., ix, 3), but such a life compared with monastic life seems
          to him a lower, and in spiritual relation, a dangerous position
          (De div., xxvii, 2), a partition of the soul between the earthly
          and heavenly. Monasticism itself he regards in an ideal manner;
          it appeals to him also not so much from the point of view of
          merit as from that of the safest way to salvation. To this the
          whole order of the monastery is subservient, aside from this it
          is of no value. Besides, Bernard had relations with the
          different monasteries and monkish associations and was
          interested in them (cf. with regard to the Premonstratensians
          Epist., viii, 4; lvi; and especially ccliii; concerning other
          regular canons, Epist., iii; xxxix, 1; lxxxvii-xc; and
          elsewhere). In his many relations with the Cluniacensians,
          frictions were not wanting (cf. Epist., i; clxiv; cclxxxiii;
          etc., and especially the Apologia ad Guilelmum), for the rise of
          the new order took place partly at the expense of the old.
          Nevertheless Bernard was highly esteemed by the Cluniacensians,
          and close friendship associated him with their head, the noble
          Peter the Venerable. That it was not interrupted is mainly due
          to Peter, who knew how to bear occasional lack of consideration
          by his great friend (cf. Epist., clxvi, 1; clxviii, 1) without
          resentment (Epist., ccxxix, 5). There existed a mutual true
          affection and admiration; the letters which they exchanged with
          each other are an honorable monument for both men, and without
          regard to differences of times and confessions modern readers
          can appreciate them.

  III. Writings.

          The works of Bernard include a large collection of letters; a
          number of treatises, dogmatic and polemic, ascetic and mystical,
          on monasticism, and on church government; a biography of St.
          Malachy, the Irish archbishop; and sermons. Hymns are also
          ascribed to him (see below). The most important are the letters,
          which constitute one of the most valuable collections of church
          history; and the sermons, of which those on the Song of Songs
          furnish the chief source of knowledge of Bernard's mysticism.
          The first and fifth books of his De consideratione are also of a
          mystic character, whereas ii, iii, and iv contain a critique of
          church affairs of his time from Bernard's point of view and lay
          down a programme for papal conduct which a contemporary pope
          would have found it difficult to follow.

          S. M. Deutsch.

  IV. Hymns.

          Five hymns are ascribed to Bernard, viz.: (1) the so-called
          Rhythmus de contemptu mundi, "O miranda vanitas! O divitiarum!"
          (2) the Rhythmica oratio ad unum quodlibet membrorum Christi
          patientis, a series of salves addressed to the feet, knees, etc.
          of the Crucified; (3) the Oratio devota ad Dominum Jesum et
          Beatam Mariam matrem ejus, "Summe summi tu patris unice"; (4) a
          Christmas hymn, "Lætabundus exultet fidelis chorus"; (5) the
          Jubilus rhythmicus de nomine Jesu, "Jesu dulcis memoria," on the
          blessedness of the soul united with Christ. All these poetical
          productions, besides being beautiful in form and composition,
          are distinguished by a tender and living feeling and a mystic
          fervor and holy love. If they are really Bernard's, he deserves
          the title of Doctor mellifluus devotusque. An addition to the
          Salve regina, closing with the words, "O clemens, O pia, O
          dulcis virgo, Maria," is also ascribed to him. Mabillon denies
          Bernard's authorship of all these hymns in spite of the ancient
          and prevalent tradition. But one is inclined to accept the
          tradition, especially since the scholastic Berengar, in his
          Apologia Abelardi contra S. Bernardum, states that Bernard was
          devoted to poetry from his youth. German adaptations of the last
          section of (2) by Paul Gerhard (1659), "O Haupt voll Blut and
          Wunden," and of (5), "O Jesu süss, wer dein gedenkt", are in
          common use; there are several English versions--as by J. W.
          Alexander, "O Sacred Head, now wounded" and "Jesus, how sweet
          thy memory is," and Ray Palmer's "Jesus, the very thought of
          thee."

          Bibliography: A very accurate list of the literature (2,761
          entries, arranged chronologically) is given by L. Janauschek, in
          Bibliographia Bernardina, Vienna, 1891. The best edition of the
          works of Bernard is by J. M. Horstius, revised and enlarged by
          J. Mabillon, Paris, 1687, corrected and enlarged 1690 and 1719,
          reprinted in MPL, clxxxii-clxxxv, of which the last vol.
          contains the old Vitæ, and some valuable additions not found in
          Mabillon. A new critical ed. of the Sermones de tempore, de
          sanctis, and de diversis has been published by B. Gsell and L.
          Janauschek in vol. i of Xenia Bernardina, Vienna, 1891. An Eng.
          transl. by S. J. Eales of the Life and Works of St. Bernard
          Clairvaux from the ed. of Mabillon, 4 vols. only completed,

          edition of the Opera, a Bernardine Chronology, List and Order of
          the Letters, and transl. of the Letters, Sermons, and Cantica
          Canticorum. Of the early biographies the most important is the
          Vita prima, MPL, clxxxv, 225-466, the first book of which, by
          William of Thierry, was written during Bernard's lifetime, the
          second, by Ernald, abbot of Bona Vallis, the other books by
          Gaufrid of Clairvaux, cf. G. Hüffer Vorstudien zu . . . Bernhard
          von Clairvaux, Münster, 1886. Of later literature note J. Pinio,

   Bernard of Cluny
          BERNARD OF CLUNY (Bernardus Morlanensis, often called Bernard of
          Morlaix, Morlanensis being improperly rendered Morlaix instead
          of Morlas): Monk of Cluny; b. probably at Morlas (5 m. n.e. of
          Pau, and then the capital of the province of Béarn); d. at Cluny
          probably about the middle of the twelfth century. Nothing more
          is known of him, except that he wrote a satirical poem of 2,991
          lines, divided into three books, and entitled De contemptu
          mundi, dedicating it to Peter the Venerable. The theme is a
          monastic and ascetic commonplace, but its handling reveals vigor
          and satirical power. The meter is a medieval adaptation of the
          dactylic hexameter, so difficult that Bernard believed he had
          divine assistance in keeping it up for so many lines; each pair
          of lines rimes and the first third of each line rimes with the
          second, thus (lines 1-2):



          "Hora novissima, tempora pessima sunt, vigilemus.

           Ecce minaciter imminet arbiter ille supremus."

          As to contents the poem is a satirical arraignment of the
          twelfth century for its vices in Church and society, sparing not
          even monks and nuns, but so exaggerated that it can not be
          accepted as history. The opening of the first book and the
          concluding part of the third are on spiritual themes of uncommon
          beauty. The poem exists in at least nine contemporary
          manuscripts and so must have been popular in its day. But it was
          forgotten until Matthias Flacius Illyricus discovered it and,
          with a view of showing that the evils of medieval Romanism of
          which the Protestants complained were already pilloried by
          Rome's faithful sons, printed a few lines from its third book in
          his Catalogus testium veritatis qui ante nostram ætatem
          reclamarunt papæ (Basel, 1556), and the next year the entire
          poem in the collection of similar poems which he entitled Varia
          doctorum piorumque virorum de corrupto Ecclesiæ statu poemata
          ante nostram ætatem conscripta. This collection was reprinted in
          1754, probably at Frankfort. The first to bring Bernard's poem
          out separately was Nathan Chytræus (Bremen, 1597), and he was
          followed by Eilhard Lubin (Rostock, 1610), Petrus Lucius
          (Rinteln, 1626), and Johann and Heinrich Stern (Luneburg, 1640).
          Finally Thomas Wright reprinted it in his Anglo-Latin Satirical
          Poets of the Twelfth Century (London, 1872, Rolls Series, No.
          59). The first complete translation, in prose, was published by
          Henry Preble (AJT, Jan.-July, 1906). In 1849 Trench published in
          his Sacred Latin Poetry (London) ninety-six lines from its first
          book, and these attracted the delighted attention of John Mason
          Neale, who translated them in his Mediæval Hymns and Sequences
          (London, 1851). His translation from Bernard leaped into
          wonderful popularity and was separately printed along with other
          lines not in Trench, as The Rhythm of Bernard de Morlaix, Monk
          of Cluny, on the Celestial Country (London, 1859; often
          reprinted). One of the hymns made by division out of this
          translation, "Jerusalem the golden," is found in all hymnbooks.
          Other pieces in prose and poetry are also attributed to Bernard.

   Bernard of Constance
          BERNARD OF CONSTANCE: German teacher and author of the eleventh
          century; d. at Corvey 1088. He was a Saxon by birth, and about
          the middle of the century presided with notable success over the
          school at Constance, which he left to teach at Hildesheim.
          During his residence here he was asked by his teacher Adalbert
          and his pupil [100]Bernold to write on the questions raised by
          the Roman synod of 1078, and answered in a lengthy treatise
          against the opponents of Gregory VII. His standpoint comes out
          even more clearly in his Liber canonum contra Henricum IV, which
          on its first publication (M. Sdralek, Die Streitschriften,
          Altmanns von Passau und Wezilos von Mainz, Paderborn, 1890) was
          erroneously ascribed to Bishop Altmann of Passau. It was written
          after the Synod of Quedlinburg at Easter, 1085, when the
          Gregorian party was in great difficulties, and is an
          uncompromising declaration of fidelity to the papal cause.
          Bernard was, in short, as his pupil Bernold describes him, not
          only "a most learned man" but also "most fervent in the cause of
          St. Peter."

   Bernard of Menthon
          BERNARD OF MENTHON: Founder of the hospices on the Great and
          Little St. Bernard. Little is known of his life, as modern
          criticism has hardly touched it, and the older biographies are
          untrustworthy and legendary. According to them he was born at
          Menthon, near Annecy (25 m. s. of Geneva), Savoy, in 923, and
          studied the liberal arts, law, and theology. To avoid a marriage
          planned by his parents, he fled to Aosta, where he was ordained
          and later became archdeacon. In addition to the most faithful
          performance of his priestly duties, he founded the two hospices
          and placed them in charge of canons regular, finally dying at
          Novara in 1007. A sequence preserved in the Acta Sanctorum, and
          dating probably from the end of the eleventh or beginning of the
          twelfth century, speaks of a meeting between him and Henry IV,
          which may possibly have occurred. It is known that in the ninth
          century there was a hospice under clerical auspices on the Mons
          Jovis, the present Great St. Bernard, which may later have
          fallen unto decay. First in 1125, and often after that date, we
          find mention of the church of St. Nicholas on the Mons Jovis; in
          1145 of the hospitale, which in 1177 is called domus hospitalis
          SS. Nicolai et Bernardi Montis Jovis. It is thus not improbable
          that Bernard restored the older foundation; but it is more
          likely that this took place at the beginning of the twelfth than
          at the end of the eleventh century. The date of 1081 for
          Bernard's death is no better attested than that of 1007.
          Innocent XI canonized him in 1881. The larger hospice, on which
          till 1752 the smaller depended, was reformed during the Council
          of Basel, receiving a very original constitution in 1438.
          Napoleon, pleased by his reception there, placed the hospice
          founded by him on the Simplon pass under the care of the same
          community, and endowed the foundation, which had lost a great
          part of the rich possessions formerly held by it in fourteen
          dioceses. It is now supported by voluntary offerings from all
          the Swiss cantons. A statue of Bernard was erected near the
          hospice in 1905.

   Bernard of Toledo
          BERNARD OF TOLEDO: Archbishop of Toledo 1086-1125; b. at Agen
          (73 m. s.e. of Bordeaux), France, c. 1050; d. in Spain 1125. His
          significance in the history of Spain lies in the fact that from
          him dates the emergence of the Spanish Church from its isolation
          and its dependence on Rome. He became a monk in the monastery of
          Cluny, whence he was sent to Spain with others to assist the
          cause of the reforms of Gregory VII. Here he was made (1080)
          abbot of St. Facundus at Sahagun in the diocese of Leon, and
          finally named by Alfonso VI for the archbishopric of Toledo.
          Gregory's plans for Spain included (besides a general crusade
          against clerical marriage, simony, and lay investiture) the
          substitution of the Roman liturgy for the Mozarabic and the
          recognition of the obligations of tribute from the Spanish
          Church. The former point had been practically gained before his
          death, in spite of strenuous opposition. Urban II, by raising
          Bernard's see to primatial dignity, gave him the power necessary
          to prosecute the work of Romanizing. His cooperation made
          possible Urban's intervention at the Synod of Leon (1091) and
          ignoring of the royal right of investiture when Alfonso
          attempted to appoint a Spaniard to the see of St. Jago,
          apparently in order to counterbalance the influence of the
          French Benedictines with whom the primate was filling the
          episcopal sees. His career was throughout that of a devoted
          adherent of the papacy. Some reminiscences of his youthful days
          as a knight appear in his forcible seizure of the Mohammedan
          mosque at Toledo in his first year as archbishop and in his
          plans for a crusade against the Saracens of the East, which both
          Urban II and Paschal II forbade, in view of the tasks which
          Spanish Christian chivalry had at home. Four of his sermons, on
          the Salve Regina, are included among those of the great Bernard.

          son of a jurist, studied law himself, and for a time led a life
          of pleasure, but was converted by what he believed was a vision
          of his departed father. He became a priest and made Paris his
          residence, where he spent his time preaching and visiting the
          poor and sick, not shrinking from the most disgusting diseases.
          He gave away all that he had, including an inheritance of

   Bernard, John Henry
          BERNARD, JOHN HENRY: Church of Ireland, dean of St. Patrick's
          Cathedral, Dublin; b. at Raniganj, Bardwan (126 m. n.w. of
          Calcutta), India, July 27, 1860. He was educated at Trinity
          College, Dublin (B.A., 1880), where he was elected fellow and
          tutor in 1884, retaining his fellowship until 1902. In 1886 he
          was ordained to the priesthood, and was chaplain to the Lord
          Lieutenant of Ireland from 1887 to 1902. Since 1888 he has been
          Archbishop King's lecturer in divinity in the University of
          Ireland, and has been dean of St. Patrick's since 1902, where he
          had already been treasurer from 1897 to 1902. He was examining
          chaplain to the bishop of Down in 1889, and was select preacher
          to the University of Oxford in 1893-1895 and to the University
          of Cambridge in 1898, 1901, and 1904. He has repeatedly been
          examiner in mental and moral philosophy for the India Civil
          Service, and has been a member of the Council of the University
          of Dublin since 1892, as well as a commissioner of national
          education for Ireland from 1697 to 1903. He was likewise a
          member of the General Synod of the Church of Ireland in 1894,
          and of the Representative Church Body in 1897, while in 1902 he
          became a warden of Alexandra College, Dublin, a commissioner of
          charitable donations and bequests for Ireland in 1904, and a
          visitor of Queen's College, Galway, in 1905. He has written or
          edited the following works: Kant's Critical Philosophy for
          English Readers (2 vols., London, 1889; in collaboration with J.
          P. Mahaffy); Kant's Criticism of Judgment (1892); From Faith to

   Bernard, Thomas Dehany
          BERNARD, THOMAS DEHANY: Church of England; b. at Clifton (a
          suburb of Bristol), Gloucestershire, Nov. 11, 1815; d. at
          Wimborne (21 m. n.e. of Dorchester), Dorsetshire, Dec. 7, 1904.
          He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford (B.A., 1838), was
          ordered deacon in 1840 and priest in the following year, and was
          successively curate and vicar of Great Baddow, Essex (1840-46),
          vicar of Terling, Essex (1848), and rector of Walcot, Somerset
          (1863-86). He was prebendary of Haselbere and canon resident of
          Wells Cathedral from 1868 to 1901, and chancellor of the same
          cathedral after 1879, while from 1880 to 1895 he was proctor for
          the dean and chapter of Wells. He was also select preacher at
          Oxford in 1855, 1862, and 1882, and was Bampton Lecturer in
          1864. He wrote The Witness of God (university sermons, London,
          1862); Progress of Doctrine in the New Testament (Bampton
          lectures, 1864, 4th ed., 1878); The Central Teaching of Jesus
          Christ (1892); and The Songs of the Holy Nativity (1895).

   Bernardin of Sienna
          BERNARDIN OF SIENNA: Franciscan; b. of noble parents at Massa
          (33 m. s.w. of Sienna) Sept. 8, 1350; d. at Aquila (58 m. n.e.
          of Rome) May 20, 1444. He entered the Franciscan order 1402;
          became its vicar-general 1437, and effected many reforms in
          discipline and government. He was the most famous preacher of
          his time and spoke to great crowds in all parts of Italy with
          wonderful effect. Three times he refused the offer of a
          bishopric. He was canonized by Nicholas V in 1450 and his day is
          May 20. His writings were first printed at Lyons (1501),
          afterward at Paris (4 vols., 1636; 5 vols., 1650) and at Venice
          (4 vols., 1745). The first volume contains his life by his
          scholar, St. John of Capistrano. Bernardin's writings are for
          the most part tractatus seu sermones, which are not so much
          sermons according to the modern view as formal treatises upon
          morals, asceticism, and mysticism.

          (Benedictine abbey on as island in the Untersee of Lake
          Constance, 4 m. w.n.w. of Constance) 1008 till his death, June
          7, 1048. He was monk in a monastery at Prüm near Treves when
          appointed abbot; under his rule Reichenau regained its
          prosperity, which had been lost under his predecessor, the abbot
          Immo; the library was enriched, scholars were attracted to the
          school, and the church of St. Mark was rebuilt. He was renowned
          personally as scholar, as poet, and, above all, as musician; he
          accompanied the emperor, Henry II, to Rome in 1014 for his
          coronation and after his return introduced reforms in German
          church music. Besides lives of saints and theological and
          liturgical treatises he left a number of letters and works upon
          music, which are published in Gerbert, Scriptores ecclesiastici
          de musica sacra, ii (St. Blaise, 1784). His writings are in MPL,
          cxliii.

   Bernold
          BERNOLD: German ecclesiastical author; b. probably in southern
          Swabia c. 1054; d. at Schaffhausen Sep. 16, 1100. He was
          educated at Constance under [104]Bernard, with whom he continued
          in close relations. He began writing early, and was present in
          Rome at the great synod of 1079 when Berengar was condemned. The
          next certain date is his ordination by the cardinal-legate Otto
          of Ostia at Constance in 1084. From 1086 to 1091 he was
          certainly an inmate of the monastery of St. Blaise in the Black
          Fort; in the latter year he migrated to Schaffhausen, where he
          remained (though not without interruption, as his presence at
          the battle of Pleichfeld shows) until his death. He was a
          versatile author. His Chronicon (ed. G. Waitz, in MGH, Script.,
          v, 1844, 385-467) is a valuable source for his own lifetime,
          though colored by his partizan support of Gregory VII. His
          treatise De Berengarii hæresiarchæ damnatione multiplici is
          interesting for the light which it throws on the attitude of
          German theology before the beginning of the strictly scholastic
          period. Most of his extant works, however, are of a practical
          nature, dealing with the vexed questions of the church life of
          his time. Though a zealous upholder of the reforming papacy, he
          was not a fanatic.

   Bernward
          BERNWARD: Bishop of Hildesheim 993-1022. He came of a noble
          Saxon family, being the grandson of the count palatine Adalbero
          and the nephew of Bishop Folkmar of Utrecht. He was educated at
          the cathedral school of Hildesheim by Thangmar, later his
          biographer, and ordained by Willigis of Mainz. In 987 he became
          chaplain at the imperial court and tutor to the young Otto III.
          On Jan. 15, 993, he was consecrated bishop of Hildesheim. He
          protected his diocese vigorously from the attacks of the
          Normans, and only once took a wrong step as a temporal
          magnate--when, at the accession of Henry II, he took the side of
          Margrave Ekkehart, whose death, however, saved him from the
          consequences of his mistake. He rendered great services to
          literature and art. He died Nov. 20, 1022, a few weeks after the
          consecration of the magnificent church of St. Michael which he
          had built. Celestine III canonized him in 1193.

   Berquin, Louis de
          BERQUIN, bar´´kan´, LOUIS DE: French Reformer; b. at Passy-Paris
          June, 1490; d. at Paris Apr. 17, 1529. He belonged to a noble
          family of Artois and was lord of the estate of Berquin, near
          Abbeville. In 1512 he came to Paris to finish his studies,
          became acquainted with Lefèvre d'Étaples and the publisher Josse
          Badius, and was introduced to Marguerite of Valois, sister of
          Francis I, through whom he gained the king's favor. He belonged
          to that group of godly humanists who wished a reformation of the
          Church, but without a rupture with Rome. He hated equally the
          ignorance of the monks and the coarseness of Luther. Erasmus
          seemed to him the true Reformer; with him therefore he opened
          correspondence and translated several of his tracts, as well as
          Luther's De votis monasticis. The doctors of the Sorbonne
          denounced him as a heretic and on May 13, 1523, the trial was
          held before the Parliament. Seven of Berquin's writings and one
          of his translations from Luther and Melanchthon were condemned
          by the theological faculty and by the Parliament. On Aug. 1, he
          was made prisoner, but was set free by order of the king, Aug.
          8. The Parliament had already burned his papers and books. The
          siege of Pavia and the captivity of the king (Feb., 1525)
          increased the Parliament's power, and the queen regent, Louise
          de Savoie, established (May 20) an extraordinary court to judge
          the heretics. On the same day three of Erasmus's treatises were
          censured. Berquin would have been permitted to retire and live
          on his estates if he had consented to keep silence. But he could
          not help speaking the truth and (Jan. 8, 1526), being denounced
          by the bishop of Amiens, he was again imprisoned. His books were
          again judged and forty of his propositions were declared
          heretical. He defended himself by saying that his propositions
          were taken from Erasmus and nobody adjudged the latter a
          heretic. His books were nevertheless condemned and he would have
          been burned with them if Marguerite of Valois had not invoked
          the clemency of her brother. Aug. 17 Francis sent a letter to
          the Parliament commanding them to take no definite steps without
          his advice. Although Erasmus advised silence, Berquin, confident
          of the king's favor, tamed the struggle and quoted from Noël
          Beda's writings against Erasmus, against the Sorbonne, and
          Lefèvre d'Étaples, twelve propositions as false and heretical,
          and asked the king to allow the Parliament to give judgment.
          From July, 1528, until March, 1529, Berquin lived in security.
          He was then again imprisoned and Parliament condemned him "to
          have his tongue branded with a red-hot iron and to remain a
          prisoner for the rest of his life." Apr. 16 Berquin appealed to
          the king, and the next day Parliament, taking advantage of the
          king's absence at Blois, ordered Berquin to be burned at the
          Place de Grève. He was the first Protestant martyr of France.
          Théodore Beza said of him: "If Francis had upheld him to the
          last, he would have been the Luther of France." Berquin's
          original works are all lost, only a few of his translations
          being left: Enchiridion du chevalier chrestien (Antwerp, 1529);
          Le vray moyen de bien et catholiquement se confesser, par Érasme
          (Lyons, 1542); Paraphrases sur le Nouveau Testament, and Le
          symbole des apôtres (both from Erasmus, n.p., n.d.).

          Nov. 7, 1681; d. at Paris Feb. 18, 1758. He served as teacher of
          his order for many years and won notoriety from an attempt to
          rewrite the Bible in French in the form of a romance fitted to
          the taste of his time; in carrying out the idea, however, he
          introduced much that was unfitting, heretical, and even
          blasphemous and obscene. He published the first part, Histoire
          du peuple de Dieu depuis son origine jusqu'à la venue du Messie,
          in seven volumes at Paris, 1728. It was put on the Index in
          1734, but reissued in expurgated shape in 8 vols. 1733-34. The
          second part included the Gospels, 4 vols. 1753, also put on the
          Index in 1755. The third part included the Epistles, in 2 vols.
          1757, but was condemned by the pope in 1758. The whole work has
          appeared in Italian, Spanish, Polish, and German transls., and
          was reissued (expurgated) in 1851 in 10 volumes.

          1704; d. at Bourges Dec. 15, 1782. He joined the Jesuits in
          1722. He added six volumes (Paris, 1749) to the twelve already

          l'église gallicane, bringing the narrative down to 1529; from
          1745 to 1762 he edited the Mémoires de Trévoux and displayed
          much moderation as well as learning under attacks from the
          Encyclopedists and Voltaire. After the expulsion of his order
          from France in 1762 he was appointed tutor to the princes
          afterward Louis XVI and Louis XVIII, but had to leave the
          country in 1764; after an absence of ten years he returned to
          Bourges. He translated the Psalms (8 vols., 1785) and the Book
          of Isaiah (5 vols., 1788-89) into French with notes. His OEuvres

   Berthold of Livonia
          BERTHOLD OF LIVONIA: Early missionary and second bishop among
          the Livonians. He was abbot of the Cistercian monastery in
          Lokkum, and was consecrated bishop to succeed Meinhard about
          1196 by Hartwig II, bishop of Bremen. After he had failed to win
          the heathen by mild means with peril of his life, he went to
          Saxony and returned with a body-guard in 1198. The Livonians
          gathered and were defeated in battle, but the bishop was slain
          July 24, 1198. His successor was [107]Albert of Riga.

   Berthold of Regensburg
          BERTHOLD OF REGENSBURG: Franciscan friar, the greatest popular
          preacher of the Middle Ages in Germany; b. at Regensburg
          probably earlier than the traditional date of 1220; d. there
          Dec. 14, 1272. He was a member of the Franciscan community
          founded at Regensburg in 1226. His novitiate was passed under
          the guidance of David of Augsburg; and by 1246 he is found in a
          position of responsibility. By 1250 at the latest, he had begun
          his career as an itinerant preacher, first in Bavaria, where he
          endeavored to bring Duke Otto II back to obedience to the
          Church; then he appears farther westward, at Speyer in 1254 and
          1255, then passing through Alsace into Switzerland. In the
          following years the cantons of Aargau, Thurgau, Constance, and
          Grisons, with the upper Rhine country, were the principal scenes
          of his activity. In 1260 he went farther afield, traversing
          after that date Austria, Moravia, Hungary, Silesia, Thuringia,
          and possibly Bohemia, reaching his Slavonic audiences through an
          interpreter. Some of his journeys in the East were probably in
          the interest of the crusade, the preaching of which was
          specially entrusted to him by Pope Urban IV in 1263.

          The German historians, from Berthold's contemporary, Abbot
          Hermann of Niedernaltaich, down to the middle of the sixteenth
          century, speak in the most glowing terms of the force of his
          personality and the effect of his preaching, which is said to
          have attracted almost incredible numbers, so that the churches
          could not hold them; and he was forced to speak from a platform
          or a tree in the open air. The gifts of prophecy and miracles
          were soon attributed to him, and his fame spread from Italy to
          England. He must have been a preacher of great talents and
          success. Although the manuscript reports of his sermons, which
          began to circulate very early, are by no means to be trusted as
          literal productions, we can still form from them a tolerably
          accurate idea of the matter and manner of his preaching. It was
          always of a missionary character, based formally on the
          Scriptures for the day, but soon departing from them to apply
          the special theme which Berthold wished to enforce. This
          generally finds its point in the insistent call to true sorrow
          for sin, sincere confession, and perfect penance; penance
          without contrition has no value in God's sight, and neither a
          crusade nor a pilgrimage has any good result unless there is a
          firm purpose to renounce sin. From this standpoint Berthold
          criticizes the new preachers of indulgences. The extremely mixed
          character of his audiences led him to make his appeal as wide
          and general as possible. He avoids subtle theological questions,
          and advises the laity not to pry into the divine mysteries, but
          to leave them to the clergy, and content themselves with the
          credo. The weighty political occurrences of the time are also
          left untouched. But everything that affects the average man--his
          joys and his sorrows, his superstitions and his prejudices--is
          handled with intimate knowledge and with a careful clearness of
          arrangement easy for the most ignorant to follow. While
          exhorting all to be content with their station in life, he
          denounces oppressive taxes, unjust judges, usury, and dishonest
          trade. Jews and heretics are to be abhorred, and players who
          draw people's minds away to worldly pleasure; dances and
          tournaments are also condemned, and he has a word of blame for
          the women's vanity and proneness to gossip. He is never dry,
          always vivid and graphic, mingling with his exhortations a
          variety of anecdotes, jests, and the wild etymologies of the
          Middle Ages, making extensive use of the allegorical
          interpretation of the Old Testament and of his strong feeling
          for nature.

   Berthold of Rorbach
          BERTHOLD OF RORBACH: Heretical mystic; d. 1356. He appears first
          in Würzburg, where he was tried on a charge of teaching heresy,
          but saved himself by recantation of the doctrines attributed to
          him. He was again brought to trial at Speyer in 1356, but this
          time refused to recant and was burned. The accounts of his
          teaching show him as an adherent of the quietistic mysticism of
          the Brothers of the Free Spirit, sharing their disbelief in the
          meritoriousness of prayer and asceticism; those who are
          "enlightened by God," laymen as well as priests, may preach the
          Gospel and change bread and wine into the divine substance. The
          strange and shocking views attributed to him on the passion of
          Christ can scarcely be reconciled with his other teachings, and
          have probably come down in a distorted form.

          m. w.n.w. of Nuremberg), Bavaria, May 8, 1774; d. at Erlangen
          Mar. 22, 1822. He studied at Erlangen and became professor
          extraordinary on the philosophical faculty 1805; full professor
          of theology 1810, in recognition of his work upon Daniel (2
          vols., Erlangen, 1806-08). His principal work was the
          Historischkritische Einleitung in die sämmtlichern kanonischen
          und apokryphischen Schriften des Alten und Neuen Testaments (6
          vols., 1812). Of less interest is his Einleitung in die
          theologischen Wissenschaften (2 vols., 1821-22); and of still
          less, his Handbuch der Dogmengeschichte (2 vols., 1822-23). As a
          teacher, however, and as editor of the Kritisches Journal der
          neuesten theologischen Litteratur, one of the principal organs
          of the rationalistic party, his activity was stimulating in many
          ways.

          Nov. 9, 1868. He was educated at the universities of his native
          city, Strasburg, and Berlin, and, after being Franco-German
          pastor at Leghorn, in 1892-93, became privet-docent for Old
          Testament exegesis in the university of his native city in 1896.
          In 1899 he was appointed associate professor of the same
          subject, and in 1905 was promoted to his present position of
          full professor. He was general secretary of the Second
          International Congress for the History of Religion held at Basel
          in 1904, and has prepared the commentaries on Leviticus,
          Deuteronomy, Ruth, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Ezekiel in K. Marti's
          Kurzer Handkommentar zum Alten Testament (5 vols., Freiburg and
          Tübingen, 1897-1902), and has written Der

   Besant, Annie (Wood)
          BESANT, bes´ant, ANNIE (WOOD): Theosophist; b. at London Oct. 1,
          1847. She was educated by private tutors at Clearmouth,
          Dorsetshire, London, Bonn, and Paris, and later passed B.Sc. and
          M.B. at London University. Originally a member of the Church of
          England, she married Rev. Frank Besant, vicar of Sibsey,
          Lincolnshire, in 1867, but was divorced from him six years later
          and renounced Christianity altogether. She then joined the
          National Secular Society, and as a scientific materialist worked
          with Charles Bradlaugh, with whom she edited the National
          Reformer. She was also prominent in socialistic and labor
          movements, and was a member of the Fabian Society and the Social
          Democratic Federation. In 1887-90 she was a member of the London
          School Board for Tower Hamlets, but declined reelection.
          Meanwhile, her views had undergone further change as a result of
          psychological study, and in 1889 she joined the Theosophical
          Society, of which she has since been a distinguished member, and
          its president in 1907. She has made extensive journeys to all
          parts of the world in the interests of theosophy, but has of
          late years resided chiefly in India. In 1898 she founded the
          Central Hindu College, Benares, and is still the president of
          its council, while in 1904 she established the Central Hindu
          Girls' School in the same city. In addition to a large number of
          briefer articles and pamphlets, she has written Natural Religion
          Versus Revealed Religion (London, 1874); History of the Great
          French Revolution (1876); The Law of Population: Its
          Consequences and its Bearing upon Human Conduct and Morals

          Psychology (1904). She has also translated a number of
          free-thought works as well as the Bhagavadgita (London, 1895),
          and has edited Our Corner (London, 1883-88), and, in
          collaboration with G. R. S. Mead, The Theosophical Review.

   Bess, Bernhard
          BESS, BERNHARD: German librarian and historian; b. at
          Nentershausen (near Cassel) May 19, 1863. He was educated at the
          universities of Marburg and Göttingen, and, after being
          privat-docent at the former university for several years, was
          appointed to his present position of librarian of the University
          of Halle in 1896. In 1902-1903 he was also entrusted with the
          organization of the library of the Prussian Historical Institute
          at Rome. He has written Frankreichs Kirchenpolitik und der
          Prozess des Jean Petit (Marburg, 1891), and Luther und das
          landesherrliche Kirchenregiment (1894). Since 1891 he has been
          the editor of the Zeitschrift für Kirchengeschichte.

   Bessarion, Johannes or Basilius
          BESSARION, bes-sê´ri-on, JOHANNES or BASILIUS: Cardinal; b. at
          Trebizond 1395; d. at Ravenna Nov. 19, 1472. He studied at
          Constantinople and at Misithra in the Peloponnesus under
          Gemistos Plethon; entered the Basilian order; became archbishop
          of Nicæa in 1437. As such he labored at Ferrara and Florence,
          1438-39, for the union of the Greek and Roman Churches (see
          [112]Ferrara-Florence, Council of). Having been made a cardinal,
          he remained in Italy, by voice and pen working for the union.
          His house at Rome became the center not only for his fugitive
          countrymen, but also for the cultivation of Greek literature in
          the West; and during his activity as legate in Bologna, 1451-55,
          he worked in the same interest at that ancient gymnasium
          illustre. At the papal election in 1455 he lacked only a few
          votes of being chosen pope, and his influence in the curia may
          be seen from the numerous diplomatic missions with which he was
          entrusted. While returning from a missionary tour to France,
          which he had undertaken for the sake of reconciling Louis XI and
          the duke of Burgundy, he died at Ravenna.

          1693, was ordained priest 1696, and was employed in various
          diplomatic negotiations by the elector of Mainz. In 1707 he
          converted the princess Elizabeth Christine of Brunswick to the
          Roman Catholic faith, and, in 1710, her grandfather, the duke

          Romanocatholicam fidem omnibus aliis præferendi motiva (Mainz,
          1708). In 1714 he became abbot of Göttweig. He prepared a

          Prodromus, has been published (2 vols., Tegernsee, 1732).

          writer; b. at Warnstedt, in the Harz, Sept. 27, 1816; d. near
          Dresden Sept. 26, 1884. He studied at Halle under Gesenius and
          Tholuck (1837), then went to Berlin, where he was influenced by
          Neander and Twesten, but still more by Hengstenberg, Otto von
          Gerlach, and others. He returned to Halle in 1838 as secretary
          to Tholuck, but a year later went as private tutor to the house
          of Major von Schenkendorf at Wulkow near Puppin. This had a
          decisive influence on his life, through his intercourse there
          with a persecuted Lutheran pastor, a guest in the house, who had
          such an effect on him that, at his ordination in 1841 as pastor
          at Wulkow, he refused to sign the Union formula except with the
          reservation that the Union related to common ecclesiastical
          organization without prejudice to the authority of the Augsburg
          Confession. In 1845 he withdrew his subscription, and after long
          negotiations was deprived of his office in 1847. Connecting
          himself with the Lutheran Church of Prussia, he became pastor of
          Seefeld in Pomerania, and zealously supported the movement to
          obtain equal rights for the Lutherans with the Union. In 1853 he
          was called to assist Graul in the direction of the Evangelical
          Lutheran mission-house; but the strain of continuous teaching
          was not suited to his vivacious and impulsive nature, and sharp
          controversies broke out over the then burning question of the
          Indian castes, so that he returned willingly to pastoral life in
          1857, becoming minister of Waldenburg in Silesia and also (1864)
          a member of the Lutheran superior council of Breslau. Failing
          health compelled him to resign his offices at Easter, 1884. His
          Bibelstunden, which he began to write in 1843 and continued at
          intervals till he had covered most of the New Testament, have
          had a salutary influence far beyond Germany. The list of his
          minor writings is a long one, and includes a number of
          controversial tractates against what he thought a hollow and
          deceiving compromise, popular biographies, devotional works, and
          sermons.

   Bethlehem
          BETHLEHEM: A town in southern Palestine, in the territory of
          Judah, often called Bethlehem Judah (e.g., Judges xvii, 7, 8;
          cf. Matt. ii, 1, 5).

    Old Testament History.

          Its significance for the Judah of Davidic times or earlier is as
          the home of Jesse (I Sam. xvi, 1), of Joab, Abishai, and Asahel
          (II Sam. ii, 32), of Elhanan (II Sam. xxi, 19), and as a place
          of sacrifice (I Sam. xvi, 3, 5). It was occupied by the
          Philistines in their war with David (II Sam. xxiii, 14).
          Rehoboam made of it a city of defense (II Chron. xi, 6), as it
          commanded the roads south and west. Though in early times it was
          a place of importance because of its situation on caravan
          routes, it became overshadowed by the growth of the capital.
          After the exile it was reckoned to the Jewish community (Ezra
          ii, 21), and was inhabited by Calebites who were driven north by
          the Edomites pressing up from the south. This possession is
          explained by the Chronicler on genealogical grounds, regarding
          the town as founded by Salma, a son of Caleb. The district of
          Ephratah, which extended from Kirjath-jearim to Bethlehem,
          became a possession of the Calebites and gave occasion for the
          name Bethlehem Ephratah, used Micah v, 2. The inhabitants were
          engaged in agriculture, viticulture, and cattle-raising.

    Present Condition.

          For the Hebrews its fame rests upon its being the home of David
          (Luke ii, 4, 11); to Christians everywhere its name is familiar
          as the birthplace of Jesus, according to the accounts in the
          Gospels of Matthew and Luke. It has retained its name unchanged
          to the present. Bait-lah?m lies five and a half miles south of
          Jerusalem, a little east of the central watershed, at a level
          above the sea of about 2,500 feet. The slopes above it have been
          terraced from early times, and their fertility rewards richly
          the labor of the inhabitants in producing olives, almonds, figs,
          and grapes. The numerous trees of the terraces give the place a
          refreshing appearance, especially to the traveler from the bare
          heights of Jerusalem. There is a spring some fifteen minutes
          eastward from the town, and water is taken from the aqueduct on
          the south leading into Jerusalem. For the rest of the
          water-supply, dependence is had upon cisterns. The population is
          about 8,000; 3,827 are Roman Catholics, 3,662 Greeks, 260
          Mohammedans, 185 Armenians; the rest are Copts, Syrians, and
          Protestants. Two-thirds are engaged in various handicrafts, the
          rest in husbandry, and all are oppressed by burdensome taxes.
          Attempts have been made at various times to connect particular
          parts of the town with David, naming for him a house, a tower,
          and a well, but the traditions are insecurely founded. The "Well
          of David" is the name given since the fifteenth century to three
          large cisterns in the northeast.

    The Church of St. Mary.

          More secure is the tradition about the birthplace of Jesus,
          covered by the celebrated Church of St. Mary, a basilica
          mentioned as early as 334 as built by Constantine's order.
          Eusebius ("Life of Constantine") confirms this report; Socrates
          and Sozomen ascribe its erection to the empress Helena; and
          Eutychius to Justinian. De Vogüé supports the first hypothesis
          on the ground of the unity of plan, conformity of extent of
          choir and grotto, and absence of architectural marks of the
          Justinian period. In this opinion he is supported by the
          architect T. Sandel, who made a new examination in 1880. This
          may well be the oldest church in the world. It was thoroughly
          restored by the emperor Manuel Comnenus, who adorned it with
          mosaics, of which work but little remains, though a description
          by F. Quaresmio (1616-26) with what is left suffices to give a
          good idea of the whole. In 1478 (or 1482) the roof was repaired
          by Philip of Burgundy and Edward IV of England, and renewed in
          1672 by the Greek patriarch Dositheos. In the latter year the
          Greeks obtained possession, which the Latins had had since the
          crusades. In 1852 Napoleon brought it about that the Latin, were
          given a share in holding it. The church, now in decay, can not
          be restored for fear of renewing outbreaks among Latins, Greeks,
          and Armenians.

          From the southeast the church rises prominently like a fortress;
          the north, east, and south sides are less pleasing to one
          approaching from those directions because of the cells of the
          monks of the different communions. It has a nave and double
          aisles, and its floor space is about ninety-eight feet by
          eighty-seven between the cross aisles. The transept and apes are
          unfortunately concealed by a wall built by the Greeks in the
          seventeenth or eighteenth century. The entire length of the
          present church, including the entrance hall, is about 230 feet.
          Two flights of steps to the north and south lead from the choir
          to the chapel of the nativity, the walls of which are
          marble-lined and hung with tapestries. The place of birth is
          marked by a silver star in the floor of a niche. Opposite is the
          place, a marbled hollow, of the old "genuine" manger. A passage
          westward leads to the tomb and chapel of Jerome.

    The Traditional Place of Jesus's Birth.

          This subterranean room, according to tradition continuous since
          Constantine, is accepted as the place of Jesus's birth. A
          tradition can be traced back to Justin Martyr that Jesus was
          born in a cave, since Joseph could find no accommodation in the
          village. But it has been disproved that the present chapel is a
          [natural] cave, while it must be noted that as early as 728 it
          was reported that the form of the cave was changed and an oblong
          room hewn out. The use of caves as adjuncts to inns or
          "shelters" is in Palestine a peculiarity of the country.

          Five minutes southeast from the church of St. Mary is the
          so-called "Milk Grotto" of the Latins, in which Joseph, Mary,
          and the child are said to have concealed themselves from Herod's
          fury before the flight into Egypt. The white of the limestone is
          attributed to the fall of a drop of milk from Mary's breast. Ten
          minutes northeast from Beth Sahur (itself fifteen minutes east
          from Bethlehem) is shown the "Grotto of the Shepherds," in which
          the angels are said to have announced to the shepherds the birth
          of the Holy Child. The underground chapel is reached by a
          passage between two ancient olive-trees.

          One of the fruits of modern missions is the honoring of Jesus in
          his birthplace, not by sanctuaries in stone, but by provision
          for the education of the young. Since 1860 there have been a
          number of Protestant and Roman Catholic schools and
          establishments, the founding of which has spurred the Greeks and
          Armenians to accomplish something for the instruction of
          children belonging to their communities.

   Bethlehemites
          BETHLEHEMITES: The name of three religious orders. (1) An
          association of Bethleemitæ, known only from Matthew Paris (Hist.
          maj., 839), who states that they existed at Cambridge, England,
          about 1257 and wore the Dominican habit, with a red star,
          referring to Matt. ii, 9-10. (2) The Knights and Hospitalers of
          the Blessed Mary of Bethlehem (Religio militaris ac hospitalis
          beatæ Mariæ Bethlemitanæ), founded by Pius II in 1459 to fight
          against the Turks. They wore a white habit with a red cross,
          were given the island of Lemnos as their seat, and did not
          survive the capture of the island by the Turks in the year of
          their foundation. (3) More important are the Bethlehem Brothers
          (Fratres Bethlemitæ; Spanish, Orden de Belemitas) of Guatemala
          (Central America), founded there about 1650 by Pierre de
          Bethencourt and after his death (1687) under the leadership of
          the brothers Rodrigo and Antonio de la Cruz. Originally
          entrusted only with the care of the hospital of Mary of
          Bethlehem in Guatemala, the order was confirmed by Innocent XI
          in 1687 and given a constitution and dress like that of the
          Capuchins. Clement XI in 1707 granted them the privileges of the
          mendicant orders. A society of Sisters of Bethlehem was founded
          in Guatemala by Anna Maria del Galdo in 1668, and both the male
          and female branches spread in Mexico, Peru, and elsewhere. A
          secularization-decree of the Spanish Cortes in 1820 suppressed
          both branches.

   Bethphany
          BETHPHANY: A name sometimes given to the festival more commonly
          known as the Epiphany. It is a barbarous invention of the
          schoolmen, from the Hebrew beth, "house," and the Greek
          -phaneia, "manifestation," which forms the latter part of the
          word Epiphany; and was intended to emphasize the miracle (in the
          house) at Cana in Galilee, which is the third event commemorated
          by the festival of the [113]Epiphany.

          18, 1805; d. at Florence, Italy, Apr. 27, 1862. He was graduated
          at Dickinson College, Carlisle, Pa., 1823; studied at Princeton
          Seminary 1823-25; served for a year as missionary among the
          negroes and sailors at Savannah, Ga.; was ordained Nov., 1827,
          and was pastor of Reformed (Dutch) churches at Rhinebeck
          (1827-30) and Utica (1830-34), N. Y., Philadelphia (First
          Church, 1834-37; Third Church, 1837-49), and Brooklyn (1851-59);
          was associate minister at the Twenty-first Street Church, New
          York, 1859-61. He was famed as a preacher and orator, as a poet,
          and as a wit. Of his numerous publications, perhaps that of most
          permanent value was his edition of Walton's Complete Angler (New
          York, 1847; new ed., 2 vols., 1880).

          Edward's School, Birmingham, and assistant curate of St.
          George's, Edgbaston, from 1888 to 1890. In the following year he
          was elected fellow and dean of Pembroke College, and since 1905
          has also been examining chaplain to the bishop of Rochester. He
          has been the editor of the Journal of Theological Studies since
          1903, and has written The Influence of Christianity on War
          (Cambridge, 1888); The Sternness of Christ's Teaching (1889);

          d. at Linum, near Fehrbellin (33 m. n.w. of Berlin), Dec. 12,
          1663. After finishing his course at Wittenberg, he became
          associate rector at Ruppin, then was for more than thirty years
          pastor at Linum. He wrote several theological and devotional
          works, by the reading of which Spener said he had profited. They
          contain edifying exhortations against forgetting the need of
          sanctification in addition to justification, but are marred by
          intemperate fanaticism; Betkius holds the clergy responsible for
          all the anti-Christian phenomena of his time, and for the divine
          judgments of the Thirty Years' war.

   Beurlin, Jakob
          BEURLIN, boi´´er-lîn, JAKOB: German Lutheran theologian; b. at
          Dornstetten (35 m. s.w. of Stuttgart) 1520; d. at Paris Oct. 28,
          1561. In Nov., 1533, he entered the university of Tübingen. When
          the Reformation was introduced in 1534, he remained faithful to
          Catholicism, but diligently studied philosophy and the writings
          of the Church Fathers, so that his transition to the new
          doctrine took place quietly. In 1541 he was made governor of the
          Martinianum, and at the same time lectured on philosophy. In
          1549 he accepted the pastorate of Derendingen near Tübingen, and
          in 1551 he was called as professor to Tübingen. On June 2, 1557,
          he examined and signed, together with other theologians, the
          Confessio Wirtembergica, which had been prepared for the Council
          of Trent, and in the month of August, together with Brenz's
          friend [116]Johann Isenmann, he went to Langensalza and
          afterward to Saxony to come to an understanding with the
          theologians and councilors of the elector Maurice concerning the
          Württemberg Confession as compared with the Saxon, which bad
          also been prepared for the Council of Trent. In Nov., 1551, in
          company with Luther's former steward, Jodocus Neuheller, pastor
          at Entringen, he was sent as theological adviser of the
          Württemberg delegates to Trent, where they took notes of the
          disputations. On Jan. 13, 1552, both returned home, but on Mar.
          7, Beurlin, Brenz, Heerbrand, and Vannius again started for
          Trent to oppose the erroneous decisions of the council, and to
          defend the Confessio Wirtembergica before it; but the council
          would not hear them in a public session, and they returned home.
          Beurlin now devoted all his time to his academic duties. He
          lectured on Melanchthon's Loci, the Gospel and First Epistle of
          John, and the Epistles to the Romans sad Hebrews, and drilled
          the young theologians in admirably conducted disputations. In
          May, 1554, the duke sent him to Prussia to pacify those who had
          been stirred up by Osiander's teaching. He was unsuccessful,
          however, and, disgusted with the behavior of the factions, he
          declined the bishopric offered to him by Duke Albert, and
          returned home. In the interest of his academic office he now
          retired in favor of Jakob Andreä, who was a more willing
          interpreter of the theology and ecclesiastical policy of
          [117]Brenz. In Oct., 1557, Beurlin and his father-in-law,
          Matthaeus Alber, went to the religious conference at Worms in
          place of the Thuringian theologians. At the Stuttgart synod
          Beurlin also remained in the background, but he assisted Brenz
          in the defense of the Confessio Wirtembergica against Peter a
          Soto, and his attack upon the central point of the Roman system
          is still worthy of consideration. Vice-chancellor of the
          university after 1557, Beurlin was the leader of the Swabians at
          the Erfurt Conference, Apr., 1561, and was still more prominent
          on his last journey made in the service of the Evangelical
          Church. King Antony of Navarre sought both at Stuttgart and
          Heidelberg for a theologian to advise him in the controversy
          which arose in Sept., 1557, at the religious conference in
          Poissy between the cardinal of Guise and Beza concerning the
          relation of the French Protestants to the Augsburg Confession.
          Duke Christopher sent three theologians, Jakob Beurlin, Jakob
          Andreä, and Balthazar Bidembach. Before leaving, Beurlin was
          made chancellor of the university and provost of the Collegiate
          Church (Sept. 29). The theologians left Oct. 3, and arrived at
          Paris Oct. 19. Meanwhile the conference at Poissy had been
          broken off, and the theologians had to wait till the king called
          them. On Oct. 24 Beurlin fell ill with the plague and died in
          Paris.

   Beveridge, William

          of Leicester), and baptized there Feb. 21, 1637; d. in London
          Mar. 5, 1708. He was educated at Cambridge; was rector of
          Ealing, a west suburb of London, 1661-72; of St. Peter's,
          Cornhill, London, 1672-1704, when he became bishop. In his day
          he was styled "the great reviver and restorer of primitive
          piety" because in his much admired sermons and other writings he
          dwelt so affectionately upon the Church of the early centuries.
          His collected works (incomplete) are in the Library of
          Anglo-Catholic Theology in 12 vols. (Oxford, 1842-48) and
          embrace six volumes of sermons; The Doctrine of the Church of
          England Consonant to Scripture, Reason, and the Fathers: A
          Complete System of Divinity (2 vols.); Codex canonum ecclesiæ
          primitivæ vindicatus ac illustratus, with the appendices, I.
          Prolegomena in Sunodikon, sive pandectas canonum; and II.
          Præfatio ad annotationes in canones apostolicos (2 vols.); and
          the still read Private Thoughts on Religion, and Church
          Catechism Explained. His Institutionum chronotogicarum libri
          duo, una cum totidem arithmetices chronologicæ libellis (London,
          1669) was once an admired treatise on chronology.

   Beyer, Hartmann
          BEYER, bai´er, HARTMANN: Reformation preacher of Frankfort,
          where he was born Sept. 30, 1516, and died Aug. 11, 1577. In
          1534 he went to Wittenberg as student of philosophy and
          theology, and received the master's degree there in 1539 and
          became private teacher of mathematics. He returned to his native
          city as preacher in 1546. The Reformation, introduced in
          Frankfort in 1522 by Hartmann Ibach, had been carried on in the
          earlier years by compulsion and rash zeal on the part of its
          adherents, and in later time was marked by doctrinal
          controversies between the Lutheran and Reformed tendencies.
          Beyer came with the determination to win the victory for
          Lutheranism, and to his activity was it due that by 1554 a
          compact Lutheran congregation stood opposed to all insinuations
          of Calvinism, while the earlier democratic and radical
          tendencies had been suppressed. In the year named, three
          congregations of Protestants from the Netherlands, who had first
          taken refuge in England but fled that country after the
          accession of Mary, came to Frankfort under the lead of
          [120]Velerandus Polanus and [121]Johannes a Lasco, bringing with
          them a Reformed creed and Reformed practises. Beyer was the soul
          of an opposition which induced the city council to deprive them
          of the church they had used for worship in 1561. In 1596 even
          the right of holding services privately was forbidden.

          The success of the emperor in the Schmalkald war and the
          promulgation of the Augsburg Interim (May, 1548) brought the
          Frankfort Reformers face to face with dangers which for the time
          quieted doctrinal disputes. The council accepted the interim
          cautiously, but its attempts to forbid preaching against the new
          law and against Roman teachings and practises, to reestablish
          church festivals, to prohibit the eating of meat on fast-days,
          and like measures met with determined and courageous resistance
          from Beyer and his colleagues. The former repeatedly expressed
          his conviction that church ordinances could be established only
          with the consent of the congregation. The struggle went on till
          1577, but the preachers gained the victory.

          Beyer issued two pseudonymous writings against the Roman
          Catholics in 1551 and while in Wittenberg prepared a treatise on
          mathematics. His sermons are preserved in forty-nine volumes in
          manuscript in Frankfort. They are marked by a beauty and force
          of language which make them powerful even today.

    1. Early Life.

          Theodore Beza (Théodore de Bèze or de Besze), Genevan Reformer,
          was born at Vézelay (8 m. w.s.w. of Avallon), in Burgundy, June
          24, 1519; d. at Geneva Oct.13, 1605. His father, Pierre de Bèze,
          royal governor of Vézelay, descended from a Burgundian family of
          distinction; his mother, Marie Bourdelot, was known for her
          generosity. Theodore's father had two brothers; one, Nicholas,
          was member of Parliament at Paris; the other, Claude, was abbot
          of the Cistercian monastery Froimont in the diocese of Beauvais.
          Nicholas, who was unmarried, on a visit to Vézelay was so
          pleased with Theodore that, with the permission of the parents,
          he took him to Paris to educate him there. From Paris Theodore
          was sent to Orléans (Dec., 1528) to enjoy the instruction of the
          famous German teacher Melchior Wolmar. He was received into
          Wolmar's house, and the day on which this took place was
          afterward celebrated as a second birthday. Young Beza soon
          followed his teacher to Bourges, whither the latter was called
          by the duchess Margaret of Angoulême, sister of Francis I.
          Bourges was one of the places in France in which the heart of
          the Reformation beat the strongest. When, in 1534, Francis I
          issued his edict against ecclesiastical innovations, Wolmar
          returned to Germany, and, in accordance with the wish of his
          father, Beza went back to Orléans to study law, and spent four
          years there (1535-39). This pursuit had little attraction for
          him; he enjoyed more the reading of the ancient classics,
          especially Ovid, Catullus, and Tibullus. He received the degree
          of licentiate in law Aug. 11, 1539, and, as his father desired,
          went to Paris, where he began practise. His relatives had
          obtained for him two benefices, the proceeds of which amounted
          to 700 golden crowns a year; and his uncle had promised to make
          him his successor.

          Beza spent two happy years at Paris and soon gained a prominent
          position in literary circles. To escape the many temptations to
          which he was exposed, with the knowledge of two friends, he
          became engaged in the year 1544 to a young girl of humble
          descent, Claudine Denosse, promising to make this engagement
          public as soon as his circumstances would allow it. He published
          a collection of Latin poems, Juvenilia, which made him famous,
          and he was everywhere considered one of the best Latin poets of
          his time. But he fell ill and his distress of body revealed to
          him his spiritual needs. Gradually he came to the knowledge of
          salvation in Christ, which he apprehended with a joyous faith.
          He then resolved to sever his connections of the time, and went
          to Geneva, the French city of refuge for the Evangelicals, where
          he arrived with Claudine Oct. 23, 1548.

    2. Teacher at Lausanne.

          He was heartily received by Calvin, who had met him already in
          Wolmar's house, and was at once publicly and solemnly married in
          the church. Beza was at a loss for immediate occupation, so he
          went to Tübingen to see his former teacher Wolmar. On his way
          home he visited Viret at Lausanne, who at once detained him and
          brought about his appointment as professor of Greek at the
          academy there (Nov., 1549). In spite of the arduous work which
          fell to his lot, Beza found time to write a Biblical drama,
          Abraham Sacrifiant (published at Geneva, 1550; Eng. transl. by
          Arthur Golding, London, 1577, ed., with introduction, notes, and
          the French text of the original, M. W. Wallace, Toronto, 1906),
          in which he contrasted Catholicism with Protestantism, and the
          work was well received. In June, 1551, he added a few psalms to
          the French version of the Psalms begun by Marot, which was also
          very successful. About the same time he published his
          Passavantius, a satire directed against Pierre Lizet of ill
          repute, formerly president of the Parliament of Paris, and
          principal originator of the "fiery chamber" (chambre ardente),
          who, being at the time (1551) abbot of St. Victor near Paris,
          was eager to acquire the fame of a subduer of heresy by
          publishing a number of polemical writings. Of a more serious
          character were two controversies in which Beza was involved at
          this time. The first concerned the doctrine of predestination
          and the controversy of Calvin with Bolsec (see [123]Calvin,
          John; [124]Bolsec, Jérôme Hermès). The second referred to the
          burning of [125]Michael Servetus at Geneva Oct. 27, 1553. In
          defense of Calvin and the Genevan magistrates, Beza published in
          1554 the work De hæreticis a civili magistratu puniendis
          (translated into French in 1560).

    3. Journeys in behalf of the Protestants.

          In 1557 Beza took a special interest in the Waldensians of
          Piedmont, who were harassed by the French government, and in
          their behalf went with Farel to Bern, Zurich, Basel,
          Schaffhausen, thence to Strasburg, Mümpelgart, Baden, and
          Göppingen. In Baden and Göppingen, Beza and Farel had to declare
          themselves concerning their own and the Waldensians' views on
          the sacrament, and on May 14, 1557, they presented a written
          declaration in which they clearly stated their position. This
          declaration was well received by the Lutheran theologians, but
          was strongly disapproved in Bern and Zurich. In the autumn of
          1557 Beza undertook a second journey with Farel to Worms by way
          of Strasburg to bring about an intercession of the Evangelical
          princes of the empire in favor of the persecuted brethren at
          Paris. With Melanchthon and other theologians then assembled at
          Worms, Beza considered a union of all Protestant Christians, but
          this proposal was decidedly negatived by Zurich and Bern. False
          reports having reached the German princes that the hostilities
          against the Huguenots in France had ceased, no embassy was sent
          to the court of France, and Beza undertook another journey in
          the interest of the Huguenots, going with Farel, Johannes
          Buddæus, and Gaspard Carmel to Strasburg and Frankfort, where
          the sending of an embassy to Paris was resolved upon.

    4. Settles in Geneva.

          Upon his return to Lausanne, Beza was greatly disturbed. In
          union with many ministers and professors in city and country,
          Viret at last thought of establishing a consistory and of
          introducing a church discipline which should inflict
          excommunication especially at the celebration of the communion.
          But the Bernese would have no Calvinistic church government.
          This caused many difficulties, and Beza thought it best (1558)
          to settle at Geneva. Here he occupied at first the chair of
          Greek in the newly established academy, and after Calvin's death
          also that of theology; besides this he was obliged to preach. He
          completed the revision of Olivetan's translation of the New
          Testament, begun some years before. In 1559 he undertook another
          journey in the interest of the Huguenots, this time to
          Heidelberg; about the same time he had to defend Calvin against
          [126]Joachim Westphal in Hamburg and [127]Tileman Hesshusen.
          More important than this polemical activity was Beza's statement
          of his own confession. It was originally prepared for his father
          in justification of his course and published in revised form to
          promote Evangelical knowledge among Beza's countrymen. It was
          printed in Latin in 1560 with a dedication to Wolmar. An English
          translation was published at London 1563, 1572, and 1585.
          Translations into German, Dutch, and Italian were also issued.

    5. Events of 1560-63.

          In the mean time things took such shape in France that the
          happiest future for Protestantism seemed possible. King Antony
          of Navarre, yielding to the urgent requests of Evangelical
          noblemen, declared his willingness to listen to a prominent
          teacher of the Church. Beza, a French nobleman and head of the
          academy in the metropolis of French Protestantism, was invited
          to Castle Nerac, but he could not plant the seed of Evangelical
          faith in the heart of the king. In the year following (1561)
          Beza represented the Evangelicals at the [128]Colloquy of
          Poissy, and in an eloquent manner defended the principles of the
          Evangelical faith. The colloquy was without result, but Beza as
          the head and advocate of all Reformed congregations of France
          was revered and hated at the same time. The queen insisted upon
          another colloquy, which was opened at St. Germain Jan. 28, 1562,
          eleven days after the proclamation of the famous January edict
          which granted important privileges to those of the Reformed
          faith. But the colloquy was broken off when it became evident
          that the Catholic party was preparing (after the massacre of
          Vassy, Mar. 1) to overthrow Protestantism. Beza hastily issued a
          circular letter (Mar. 25) to all Reformed congregations of the
          empire, and with Condé and his troops went to Orléans. It was
          necessary to proceed quickly and energetically. But there were
          neither soldiers nor money. At the request of Condé, Beza
          visited all Huguenot cities to obtain both. He also wrote a
          manifesto in which he showed the justice of the Reformed cause.
          As one of the messengers to collect soldiers and money among his
          coreligionists, Beza was appointed to visit England, Germany,
          and Switzerland. He went to Strasburg and Basel, but met with
          failure. He then returned to Geneva, which he reached Sept. 4.
          He had hardly been there fourteen days when he was called once
          more to Orléans by d'Andelot. The campaign was becoming more
          successful; but the publication of the unfortunate edict of
          pacification which Condé accepted (Mar. 12, 1563) filled Beza
          and all Protestant France with horror.

    6. Calvin's Successor.

          For twenty-two months Beza had been absent from Geneva, and the
          interests of school and Church there and especially the
          condition of Calvin made it necessary for him to return. For
          there was no one to take the place of Calvin, who was sick and
          unable longer to bear the burden resting on him. Calvin and Beza
          arranged to perform their duties jointly in alternate weeks, but
          the death of Calvin occurred soon afterward (May 27, 1564). As a
          matter of course Beza was his successor. Until 1580 Beza was not
          only modérateur de la compagnie des pasteurs, but also the real
          soul of the great institution of learning at Geneva which Calvin
          had founded in 1559, consisting of a gymnasium and an academy.
          As long as be lived, Beza was interested in higher education.
          The Protestant youth for nearly forty years thronged his
          lecture-room to hear his theological lectures, in which he
          expounded the purest Calvinistic orthodoxy. As a counselor he
          was listened to by both magistrates and pastors. Geneva is
          indebted to him for the founding of a law school in which
          François Hotman, Jules Pacius, and Denys Godefroy, the most
          eminent jurists of the century, lectured in turn (cf. Charles
          Borgeaud, L'Académie de Calvin, Geneva, 1900).

    7. Course of Events after 1564.

          As Calvin's successor, Beza was very successful, not only in
          carrying on his work but also in giving peace to the Church at
          Geneva. The magistrates had fully appropriated the ideas of
          Calvin, and the direction of spiritual affairs, the organs of
          which were the "ministers of the word" and "the consistory," was
          founded on a solid basis. No doctrinal controversy arose after
          1564. The discussions concerned questions of a practical,
          social, or ecclesiastical nature, such as the supremacy of the
          magistrates over the pastors, freedom in preaching, and the
          obligation of the pastors to submit to the majority of the
          campagnie des pasteurs. Beza obtruded his will in no way upon
          his associates, and took no harsh measures against injudicious
          or hot-headed colleagues, though sometimes he took their cases
          in hand and acted as mediator; and yet he often experienced an
          opposition so extreme that he threatened to resign. Although he
          was inclined to take the part of the magistrates, he knew how to
          defend the rights and independence of the spiritual power when
          occasion arose, without, however, conceding to it such a
          preponderating influence as did Calvin. His activity was great.
          He mediated between the compagnie and the magistracy; the latter
          continually asked his advice even in political questions. He
          corresponded with all the leaders of the Reformed party in
          Europe. After the massacre of St. Bartholomew (1572), he used
          his influence to give to the refugees a hospitable reception at
          Geneva. About this time he wrote his De jure magistratuum, in
          which he emphatically protested against tyranny in religious
          matters, and affirmed that it is legitimate for a people to
          oppose an unworthy magistracy in a practical manner and if
          necessary to use weapons and depose them. To sum up: Without
          being a great dogmatician like his master, nor a creative genius
          in the ecclesiastical realm, Beza had qualities which made him
          famous as humanist, exegete, orator, and leader in religious and
          political affairs, and qualified him to be the guide of the
          Calvinists in all Europe. In the various controversies into
          which he was drawn, Beza often showed an excess of irritation
          and intolerance, from which Bernardino Ochino, pastor of the
          Italian congregation at Zurich (on account of a treatise which
          contained some objectionable points on polygamy), and Sebastian
          Castellio at Basel (on account of his Latin and French
          translations of the Bible) had especially to suffer. With
          Reformed France Beza continued to maintain the closest
          relations. He was the moderator of the general synod which met
          in April, 1571, at La Rochelle and decided not to abolish church
          discipline or to acknowledge the civil government as head of the
          Church, as the Paris minister Jean Morel and the philosopher
          Pierre Ramus demanded; it also decided to confirm anew the
          Calvinistic doctrine of the Lord's Supper (by the expression:
          "substance of the body of Christ") against Zwinglianism, which
          caused a very unpleasant discussion between Beza and Ramus and
          Bullinger. In the following year (May, 1572) he took an
          important part in the national synod at Nîmes. He was also
          interested in the controversies which concerned the Augsburg
          Confession in Germany, especially after 1564, on the doctrine of
          the person of Christ and the sacrament, and published several
          works against Westphal, Hesshusen, Selnecker, Johann Brenz, and
          Jakob Andrea. This made him, especially after 1571, hated by all
          those who adhered to Lutheranism in opposition to Melanchthon.

    8. The Colloquy of Mümpelgart.

          The last polemical conflict of importance Beza encountered from
          the exclusive Lutherans was at the [129]Colloquy of Mümpelgart,
          Mar. 14-27, 1586, to which he had been invited by the Lutheran
          Count Frederick of Württemberg at the wish of the French
          noblemen who had fled to Mümpelgart. As a matter of course the
          intended union which was the purpose of the colloquy was not
          brought about; nevertheless it called forth serious developments
          within the Reformed Church. When the edition of the acts of the
          colloquy, as prepared by J. Andreä, was published, Samuel Huber,
          of Burg near Bern, who belonged to the Lutheranizing faction of
          the Swiss clergy, took so great offense at the supralapsarian
          doctrine of predestination propounded at Mümpelgart by Beza and
          Musculus that he felt it to be his duty to denounce Musculus to
          the magistrates of Bern as an innovator in doctrine. To adjust
          the matter, the magistrates arranged a colloquy between Huber
          and Musculus (Sept. 2, 1587), in which the former represented
          the universalism, the latter the particularism, of grace. As the
          colloquy was resultless, a debate was arranged at Bern, Apr.
          15-18, 1588, at which the defense of the accepted system of
          doctrine was at the start put into Beza's hands. The three
          delegates of the Helvetic cantons who presided at the debate
          declared in the end that Beza had substantiated the teaching
          propounded at Mümpelgart as the orthodox one, and Huber was
          dismissed from his office.

    9. Last Days.

          After that time Beza's activity was confined more and more to
          the affairs of his home. His faithful wife Claudine had died
          childless in 1588, a few days before he went to the Bern
          Disputation. Forty years they had lived happily together. He
          contracted, on the advice of his friends, a second marriage with
          Catharina del Piano, a Genoese widow, in order to have a
          helpmate in his declining years. Up to his sixty-fifth year he
          enjoyed excellent health, but after that a gradual sinking of
          his vitality became perceptible. He was active in teaching till
          Jan., 1597. The saddest experience in his old days was the
          conversion of King Henry IV to Roman Catholicism, in spite of
          his most earnest exhortations (1593). Strange to say, in 1596
          the report was spread by the Jesuits in Germany, France,
          England, and Italy that Beza and the Church of Geneva had
          returned into the bosom of Rome, and Beza replied in a satire
          that revealed the possession still of his old fire of thought
          and vigor of expression. He was not buried, like Calvin, in the
          general cemetery, Plain-Palais (for the Savoyards had threatened
          to abduct his body to Rome), but at the direction of the
          magistrates, in the monastery of St. Pierre.

    10. Humanistic and Historical Writings.

          In Beza's literary activity as well as in his life, distinction
          must be made between the period of the humanist (which ended
          with the publication of his Juvenilia) and that of the
          ecclesiastic. But later productions like the humanistic, biting,
          satirical Passavantius and his Complainte de Messire Pierre
          Lizet . . . prove that in later years he occasionally went back
          to his first love. In his old age he published his Cato
          censorius (1591), and revised his Poemata, from which he purged
          juvenile eccentricities. Of his historiographical works, aside
          from his Icones (1580), which have only an iconographical value,
          mention may be made of the famous Histoire ecclésiastique des
          Églises réformée s au Royaume de France (1580), and his
          biography of Calvin, with which must be named his edition of
          Calvin's Epistolæ et responsa (1575).

    11. Theological Works.

          But all these humanistic and historical studies are surpassed by
          his theological productions (contained in Tractationes
          theologicæ). In these Beza appears the perfect pupil or the
          alter ego of Calvin. His view of life is deterministic and the
          basis of his religious thinking is the predestinate recognition
          of the necessity of all temporal existence as an effect of the
          absolute, eternal, and immutable will of God, so that even the
          fall of the human race appears to him essential to the divine
          plan of the world. In most lucid manner Beza shows in tabular
          form the connection of the religious views which emanated from
          thin fundamental supralapsarian mode of thought. This he added
          to his highly instructive treatise Summa totius Christianismi.

    12. Beza's Greek New Testament.

          Of no less importance are the contributions of Beza to Biblical
          science. In 1565 he issued an edition of the Greek New
          Testament, accompanied in parallel columns by the text of the
          Vulgate and a translation of his own (already published as early
          as 1556). Annotations were added, also previously published, but
          now he greatly enriched and enlarged them. In the preparation of
          this edition of the Greek text, but much more in the preparation
          of the second edition which he brought out in 1582, Beza may
          have availed himself of the help of two very valuable
          manuscripts. One is known as the Codex Bezæ or Cantabrigensis,
          and was later presented by Beza to the University of Cambridge;
          the second is the Codex Claromontanus, which Beza had found in
          Clermont (now in the National Library at Paris). It was not,
          however, to these sources that Beza was chiefly indebted, but
          rather to the previous edition of the eminent Robert Stephens
          (1550), itself based in great measure upon one of the later
          editions of Erasmus. Beza's labors in this direction were
          exceedingly helpful to those who came after. The same thing may
          be asserted with equal truth of his Latin version and of the
          copious notes with which it was accompanied. The former is said
          to have been published over a hundred times. It is to be
          regretted that the author's view of the doctrine of
          predestination exercised upon the interpretation of Scripture
          too preponderating an influence. However, there is no question
          that Beza added much to a clear understanding of the New
          Testament.

          (1879-80; Ph.D., 1881), and Strasburg (1881), and became
          privat-docent at Munich in 1883. He continued his studies at
          Rome in the spring of 1884 and at London in the summer of 1882
          and 1887, while from 1888 to 1894 he was employed in the British
          Museum. Since the latter year he has been professor of Oriental

          year as the Zeitschrift für Assyriologie, and which he has
          edited to the present time. He likewise edited the second

          The Bible in the Early Church (§ 1).

          In the Middle Ages and Reformation Period (§ 2).

          Modern Views and Criticism (§ 3).

          Wherein the Bible is Unique (§ 4).

          The word "Bible" (from Gk. biblia, "books") or "Holy Scripture"
          is the customary term in Church and theology for the
          ecclesiastically acknowledged collection of the Old and the New
          Testament writings. As the writings of the Old Testament canon
          are indicated in the New Testament by the term "The Scriptures"
          or "The Scripture," so in the Middle Ages the whole was
          designated by "The Books." By a misunderstanding of the Greek
          form, the word was received into the modern languages as a
          singular of feminine gender.

    1. The Bible in the Early Church.

          The separation of these writings from all other literature as
          "the Book of Books" is derived from the practise of Jesus, who,
          with his contemporaries, acknowledged the authority of the Old
          Testament literature (M. Kaehler, Jesus und das Alte Testament,
          Leipsic, 1895). The Old Testament was conveyed, in the Greek
          translation of the Septuagint, as the Word of God, to the
          Gentile Christians by the followers of Jesus. At the latest in
          the beginning of the third century, the New Testament canon was
          added to the Old Testament, as is witnessed by the Syriac
          version (see [130]Canon of Scripture). And from that time the
          bipartite collection was always treated as a whole, although the
          uncertainty about some books (the so-called Antilegomena) was
          not forgotten during the Middle Ages, was recognized by Luther
          and other Reformers, and was treated from a dogmatic standpoint
          by Martin Chemnitz (Examen concilii Tridentini, Frankfort,
          1596). The controversy about the Old Testament Apocrypha has
          never been settled. What esteem the Bible enjoyed in the ancient
          catholic Church is seen from its controlling position in divine
          service, in the reading of Scripture, and in the delivery of
          sermons founded on it, but especially from the labor spent in
          translating it (see [131]Bible Versions, A).

    2. In the Middle Ages and Reformation Period.

          It must not be imagined that the Middle Ages did not rightly
          appreciate the Bible. It is necessary to take into account the
          great difficulties which confronted the Church at that time in
          forming an ecclesiastical language, and even a literary
          language, for the Germanic and Slavic nations. In the absence of
          modern philology the efforts made are worthy of acknowledgment.
          The hierarchical development of the Church tended to paralyze it
          by enforcing uniformity in use of the church-language at the
          expense of intelligibility, and in the interest of an easier
          management put the "heretical book" into the keeping of the
          ecclesiastical magistracy. But the Reformation introduced a new
          epoch of wide propagation and appreciation of the Bible. The
          efforts of the Reformers to make this book accessible to all
          Christians were taken up by Pietism under Spener; the founding
          of the Canstein Bible Institute (see [132]Bible Societies, II,
          1; [133]Canstein, Karl Hildebrand, Baron on) and the sending out
          of the first missionaries opened the double way by which the
          Bible, especially in the nineteenth century, has obtained its
          commanding position in the world; knowledge of the Bible has
          been spread by the [134]Bible Societies through hundreds of new
          translations (a work in which Englishmen and Scotchmen, well
          read in the Scriptures, have distinguished themselves). The
          Bible has become in the fullest sense the people's book in all
          Protestant countries of the Old World, and the same process is
          being repeated among the non-Christian nations, to which
          missionary cooperation gives the Bible and with it often also an
          alphabet and a literary language.

    3. Modern Views and Criticism.

          This zeal for the propagation of the Bible has its root in the
          unique importance which the theology of the Reformation ascribes
          to it. In opposition to the ecclesiastical position of Rome, the
          Evangelicals developed their doctrine of the "normative or
          decisive authority of Scripture" on the basis of the
          uncontroverted character of the Scripture as revelation. This
          high regard has as its foundation the doctrine of "verbal
          inspiration" (see [135]Inspiration), which ascribes to the Bible
          all requisite qualities, such as "perfection" in communicating
          the "knowledge necessary for salvation," " transparency," and
          the "power of interpreting itself by itself." Unobserved, the
          body of pure doctrine, by the help of which the renewal of
          evangelical activity had been accomplished, became transformed
          into a set of doctrines which were mechanically combined,
          regardless of their historical origin. In opposition to the
          adulterated tradition of Rome, Protestantism could happily refer
          to the bulwark of Scripture, in which Roman Catholics also
          acknowledged divine revelation. But evangelical theology first
          succumbed to the attack which the "Enlightenment" (Aufklärung),
          about the middle of the eighteenth century, made upon all
          history and tradition and especially upon historical revelation.
          In vain the effort was made to prove dogmatically the immediate
          divine origin of the Bible-letter, while proof was also given in
          an ever-cogent manner that the Bible is a production of human
          authorship and tradition. This crisis was gradually overcome by
          the victory gained for the "historico-critical" method of
          treating the Bible, but the right of historical revelation was
          established over against "natural morality and religion." As in
          earlier times historical development within the Bible was now
          and then perceived (e.g., by Cocceius and Bengel), so now
          students see in its writings documents of divine revelation
          which entered into the human world as historical facts (so the
          Erlangen School). Only one group of theologians of the
          nineteenth century (e.g., Hengstenberg and Rudelbach) went back
          again to the old doctrine of verbal inspiration; most
          investigators assumed a new attitude toward Scripture. Documents
          to have value must be shown to be ancient and to be derived from
          a time near the events they relate; there must be testimony to
          their genuineness and credibility. But such merely historical
          consideration of the Bible proved insufficient and dangerous in
          the next period. "Liberal theology, endowed with technical
          skill," showed error in Biblical tradition from a critical point
          of view, and in place of the Biblical evidences it substituted
          conjecturally the details of a natural history of religion,
          which it composed after the Hegelian formula to the effect that
          in the "historical revelation" there is to be seen the
          development of a religious idea, an act in the drama of the
          natural development of humanity (so F. C. Baur, E. Reuss, and
          Wellhausen). The results of this modern criticism were
          propagated among the people through the press and by pamphlets
          in a wild confusion along with the older, would-be enlightening
          defamations of the Bible (so by Reimarus, Venturini, and
          Bahrdt). Over against this sprang up a comprehensive literature
          which sought to gain those who were estranged from the Bible and
          to reassure disquieted readers. It was based on an
          acknowledgment of the part the revelation of God has played in
          the education of the race, and in a scientific manner discarded
          the unjustified conclusions of the so-called constructive
          criticism, at least as far as the New Testament is concerned. In
          this intellectual battle it became evident that the estimate of
          the Bible stands in an indissolubly reciprocal relation to the
          position taken toward positive Christianity in general.

    4. Wherein the Bible is Unique.

          It is therefore absolutely necessary (especially for the
          ministry and for ecclesiastical instruction) to have a clear
          insight into that which makes our Bible the unique "Book of
          Books." This is obtained by observing what it is that has given
          the Bible its historical position. Throughout the whole course
          of its working in the human race the Bible appears only in close
          connection with the Church, the essential activity of which,
          according to the Augsburg Confession (vii), is the preaching of
          "the Word." The common object of both is to convey the
          revelation of the living God. Whoever has become a believer in
          the Gospel and recalls his experience perceives also that the
          service of the Church by which he was led to it was inspired by
          the Bible, and further observation of life and history teaches
          that the efficacy of the work of the Church is dependent on the
          use it makes of the Bible. For only in the Scripture is found
          the unchangeable and therefore authoritative form of preaching
          which first induced faith in Christ and continues so to do. On
          the other hand, the Christian also recognizes that his personal
          relation to the Bible is due to the "living voice of the Gospel"
          and that through the Church he comes into personal relation with
          the Bible. He understands also that the Bible is the book of the
          Church (so Luther), but not a text-book or devotional book which
          in all its parts is immediately useful to the individual
          Christian. In it are found productions which are far remote from
          one another in date, which originally were intended for entirely
          different circles with quite peculiar wants. On this account
          only the cooperation of different gifts and the diligence of
          generations working on a scientific basis can bring out its full
          content. Under the assumption of this service of the Church each
          living Christian has the possibility of coming thus through his
          Bible into immediate touch with the historical revelation of his
          God from the promise of the covenant to the beginning of the
          mission to the Gentiles. While historical inquiry establishes
          the historical continuation, and divides the whole Bible into
          single historical accounts and documents, the view of most
          Bible-readers is directed only to the Bible as a whole, and
          seeks in every fragment a word of God applicable to immediate
          questions and wants. These divergent interests must be united by
          observing that the individual parts, by being comprehended as
          "the Bible," receive a new worth, and that in this very form
          they obtain an imperishable, effective continuity, instead of
          being merely individual monuments of past times. The collection
          is not an accidental one, but transcribes in characteristic
          features the life of the human race as it developed under the
          influence of the history of revelation. To him therefore who
          sees in reliance on God the stay of human life, the Bible will
          also be the book of the human race. For Christian belief the
          Bible appears thus as the great fact in which God has
          inseparably interwoven the faith-awakening knowledge of his
          revelation with the history of the human race, and in it is
          discerned the clear testimony to the goal of the human race and
          the conquering offer of God's grace.

          Bible Christians or Bryanites are popular names of a body of
          Christians officially known as the Bible Christian Connection.
          The designation "Bryanites" is from their founder, William
          O'Bryan; that of "Bible Christians" was due to the persistent
          use of the Bible in private devotions and public services by a
          peasantry in general but scantily provided with the book, and to
          the consistent practise of its precepts by their early ministry.
          The sect has usually been classed with the Methodists and is now
          united with them.

    1. William O'Bryan.

          William O'Bryan, the founder, was born in Gunwen (near
          Lostwithiel, 23 m. w. of Plymouth), Cornwall, England, Feb. 6,
          1778. He was the son of a yeoman, was possessed of a vigorous
          mind and retentive memory, and, having a good elementary
          education, was, intellectually, considerably above his class.
          His home influences were devoutly religious and resulted in his
          conversion at eighteen, when he began at once to exhort. He was
          licensed shortly after as a "local preacher" with the hope of
          entering the Wesleyan itinerancy; meanwhile he engaged in
          business.

          Serious illness (1804) reawakened in him a profound conviction
          of his call, which delay and opposition had weakened for a time.
          For five years more he was content to work on the Bodmin circuit
          as a local preacher of the Wesleyans, while still in business.
          His fine presence, courteous manner, great magnetism, and above
          all his fervent godliness gave him much popularity as a
          preacher. In his keen hunting for souls, he grew restive under
          restraint, overstepped the boundary of the circuit and plunged
          into the "wild wastes of Cornwall and North Devon," where the
          voice of Methodism had never been heard.

          This in the mind of the Wesleyan authorities was a "dangerous
          irregularity" of method, against which Mr. O'Bryan had been
          cautioned, and, when he appeared at the district meeting as a
          candidate for the itinerancy, caused his "first" rejection; the
          financial responsibility which would be incurred by accepting a
          married man, as he now was, was named as the "second" cause for
          his "final" rejection. He at once entered unoccupied fields in a
          new campaign. His unquestioned moral uprightness, indefatigable
          labors, and unsparing self-sacrifice made his evangelical
          message remarkably successful; and the generosity which prompted
          him to urge all his converts to enter the Church that had
          rejected him from its highest office of ministry compels
          admiration. A tendency to despotic rule, to which by nature and
          force of circumstances he was inclined (see below, [137]§ 3),
          led to a separation in 1829 from the Connection which he had
          founded, and in 1835 to his emigration to the United States with
          residence in New York City. He revisited his spiritual children
          more than once and was heartily welcomed. A generous pension was
          provided for his support by the body. He died in Brooklyn, Jan.
          8, 1868, and was buried in Greenwood Cemetery.

    2. Early Organization and Growth.

          The germ of the Bible Christian denomination consisted of
          twenty-two persons, converts of Mr. O'Bryan, who were organized
          into a society on Oct. 9, 1815, in the house of John Thorne,
          Shebbear, Devonshire, England. Within a year this number became
          eighteen ministers and 1,500 members; and at the sixth year
          seventy-eight ministers and 6,200 members. To carry forward a
          work extending so rapidly, Mr. O'Bryan adopted John Wesley's
          plan and "chose and appointed" both men and women as itinerants.
          The proportion of women was large in the early history of the
          Church, and their work was eminently successful; yet their
          number steadily declined and ultimately none remained in the
          itinerancy. With this working force evangelism was extended into
          Devonshire and Cornwall, the Scilly and Channel Islands, and
          later by emigration (1820-30) to America.

    3. Dissension.

          Organization into societies and circuits required meeting-places
          and chapels--at first preaching was mostly in the field, the
          village green, in hired halls, and in houses--and all property
          acquired for such purpose was held in Mr. O'Bryan's name. He
          also presided over the conference, the first being held at
          Launceston (1819), and composed of ministers only. To all this
          absolutism, there was serious objection, and an effort to secure
          an amended deed by which all property should be held in trust
          for the Connection was begun in 1826. A crisis was reached at
          the eleventh conference (1829), when opposition to Mr. O'Bryan's
          expressed intention "that if all the conference were opposed to
          his views, his single vote was to determine every case,"
          resulted in his adjourning the conference, and withdrawing with
          comparatively few sympathizers. The conference refused to
          recognize his authority, elected Andrew Cory president in his
          stead, and proceeded with business. It was resolved "that the
          conference be the organ of government; its membership, ministers
          and laymen; and its next place of meeting annually fixed." The
          conference thus declared against an episcopacy, as it also
          decided against ecclesiasticism by admitting laymen to church
          government in equal numbers with clerical members. Eight years
          later these separatists negotiated terms of reunion, but Mr.
          O'Bryan never again united.

    4. Extension to America and Australia.

          Many members of the infant Church emigrated to the colonies and
          the United States. In 1831 the Missionary Society of the Bible
          Christians in England sent John Glass and Francis Metherall as
          missionaries to Canada West and Prince Edward Island
          respectively. They also organized missions (1846) in the States
          of Wisconsin, Ohio, and Michigan. In 1850 James Way and James
          Rowe were sent out to Australia, and later work was begun in New
          Zealand. For the next quarter of a century the Church enjoyed
          undisturbed prosperity, establishing three publishing houses,
          and a denominational college at Shebbear, Devonshire, England.
          In 1882, 300 ministers and 34,000 members were reported. This
          was the high-water mark numerically.

    5. Union with the Methodists in Canada.

          These years of extension had awakened, in a much divided
          Methodism, a sense of the advisability of "union," in both
          England and the colonies. The center of discussion was Canada,
          where five Methodist sects wasted their energy in vigorous, if
          not unseemly, rivalry. As early as 1866 the Bible Christians and
          Methodist New Connection approached the Methodist Protestants of
          the United States upon the question of union, but the overture
          ended in friendly expressions only. In 1870 the Methodist New
          Connection made overtures to the Bible Christians, and in 1874
          the former were absorbed by the Wesleyan Methodists of Canada.
          The Bible Christians announced as their policy--a policy
          consistently held since organization--"That any basis of union
          to be acceptable to this Conference must secure to the laity
          their full share of privileges in the government of the Church."
          In 1882 a committee was appointed by the Bible Christians to
          meet with three other committees, representing the Wesleyan
          Methodists, the Primitive Methodists, and the Methodist
          Episcopal Church of Canada. This committee was explicitly
          instructed to reaffirm "That no union would be possible for
          their Church that did not provide for a representation of the
          laity in all church courts." A basis of union was provided
          acceptable to all parties, voted upon by every society, and in
          1884 union was fully and legally perfected. The uniting churches
          chose as a name "The Methodist Church of Canada." The parent
          body graciously consented to the separation, which affected the
          work in Canada and the United States only.

    6. Union in Australia and England.

          The energy and resources of the English and Australian
          conferences were now devoted to an enlargement of home missions
          and in the establishment of a foreign mission in China, which
          has been successful. A union of the Australian conference with
          other Methodist sects in that colony left but the parent body
          bearing the name; and in Aug., 1906, this Church voted
          unanimously to unite with the Methodist New Connection and the
          United Methodists, the union to be formally and legally
          consummated in 1907. The name of "United Methodist Church" was
          chosen for the new organization. At the time of approving the
          union the Bible Christians had 638 chapels, 202 ministers, and
          30,000 members.

  I. The Ancient Church.

          It is indisputable that in Apostolic times the Old Testament was
          commonly read (John v, 47; Acts viii, 28; xvii, 11; II Tim. iii,
          15). Roman Catholics admit that this reading was not restricted
          in the first centuries, in spite of its abuse by Gnostics and
          other heretics. On the contrary, the reading of Scripture was
          urged (Justin Martyr, xliv, ANF, i, 177-178; Jerome, Adv. libros
          Rufini, i, 9, NPNF, 2d ser., iii, 487); and Pamphilus, the
          friend of Eusebius, kept copies of Scripture to furnish to those
          who desired them. Chrysostom attached considerable importance to
          the reading of Scripture on the part of the laity and denounced
          the error that it was to be permitted only to monks and priests
          (De Lazaro concio, iii, MPG, xlviii, 992; Hom. ii in Matt., MPG,
          lvii, 30, NPNF, 2d ser., x, 13). He insisted upon access being
          given to the entire Bible, or at least to the New Testament
          (Hom. ix in Col., MPG, lxii, 361, NPNF, xiii, 301). The women
          also, who were always at home, were diligently to read the Bible
          (Hom. xxxv on Gen. xii, MPG, liii, 323). Jerome recommended the
          reading and studying of Scripture on the part of the women
          (Epist., cxxviii, 3, MPL, xxii, 1098, NPNF, 2d ser., vi, 259;
          Epist., lxxix, 9, MPG, xxii, 730-731, NPNF, 2d ser., vi, 167).
          The translations of the Bible, Augustine considered a blessed
          means of propagating the Word of God among the nations (De
          doctr. christ., ii, 5, NPNF, 1st ser., ii, 536); Gregory I
          recommended the reading of the Bible without placing any
          limitations on it (Hom. iii in Ezek., MPL, lxxvi, 968).

  II. The Middle Ages.

          Owing to lack of culture among the Germanic and Romanic peoples,
          there was for a long time no thought of restricting access to
          the Bible there. Translations of Biblical books into German
          began only in the Carolingian period and were not originally
          intended for the laity. Nevertheless the people were anxious to
          have the divine service and the Scripture lessons read in the
          vernacular. John VIII in 880 permitted, after the reading of the
          Latin gospel, a translation into Slavonic; but Gregory VII, in a
          letter to Duke Vratislav of Bohemia in 1080 characterized the
          custom as unwise, bold, and forbidden (Epist., vii, 11; P.
          Jaffé, BRG, ii, 392 sqq.). This was a formal prohibition, not of
          Bible reading in general, but of divine service in the
          vernacular.

          With the appearance, in the twelfth and thirteenth centuries, of
          the Albigenses and Waldenses, who appealed to the Bible in all
          their disputes with the Church, the hierarchy was furnished with
          a reason for shutting up the Word of God. The Synod of Toulouse
          in 1229 forbade the laity to have in their possession any copy
          of the books of the Old and the New Testament except the Psalter
          and such other portions as are contained in the Breviary or the
          Hours of the Blessed Mary. "We most strictly forbid these works
          in the vulgar tongue" (Harduin, Concilia, xii, 178; Mansi,
          Concilia, xxiii, 194). The Synod of Tarragona (1234) ordered all
          vernacular versions to be brought to the bishop to be burned.
          James I renewed thin decision of the Tarragona synod in 1276.
          The synod held there in 1317 under Archbishop Ximenes prohibited
          to Beghards, Beguines, and tertiaries of the Franciscans the
          possession of theological books in the vernacular (Mansi,
          Concilia, xxv, 627). The order of James I was renewed by later
          kings and confirmed by Paul II (1464-71). Ferdinand and Isabella
          (1474-1516) prohibited the translation of the Bible into the
          vernacular or the possession of such translations (F. H. Reusch,
          Index der verbotenen Bücher, i, Bonn, 1883, 44).

          In England Wyclif's Bible-translation caused the resolution
          passed by the third Synod of Oxford (1408): "No one shall
          henceforth of his own authority translate any text of Scripture
          into English; and no part of any such book or treatise composed
          in the time of John Wycliffe or later shall be read in public or
          private, under pain of excommunication" (Hefele,
          Conciliengeschichte, vi, 984). But Sir Thomas More states that
          he had himself seen old Bibles which were examined by the bishop
          and left in the hands of good Catholic laymen (Blunt,
          Reformation of the Church of England, 4th ed., London, 1878, i,
          505). In Germany, Charles IV issued in 1369 an edict to four
          inquisitors against the translating and the reading of Scripture
          in the German language. This edict was caused by the operations
          of Beghards and Beguines. In 1485 and 1486, Berthold, archbishop
          of Mainz, issued an edict against the printing of religious
          books in German, giving among other reasons the singular one
          that the German language was unadapted to convey correctly
          religious ideas, and therefore they would be profaned.
          Berthold's edict had some influence, but could not prevent the
          dissemination and publication of new editions of the Bible.
          Leaders in the Church sometimes recommended to the laity the
          reading of the Bible, and the Church kept silence officially as
          long as these efforts were not abused.

  III. The Roman Catholic Church since the Reformation.

          Luther's translation of the Bible and its propagation could not
          but influence the Roman Catholic Church. Humanism, through such
          men as Erasmus, advocated the reading of the Bible and the
          necessity of making it accessible by translations; but it was
          felt that Luther's translation must be offset by one prepared in
          the interest of the Church. Such editions were Emser's of 1527,
          and the Dietenberg Bible of 1534. The Church of Rome silently
          tolerated these translations.

    1. Action by the Council of Trent.

          At last the Council of Trent took the matter in hand, and in its
          fourth session (Apr. 18, 1546) adopted the Decretum de editione
          et usu librorum sacrorum, which enacted the following: "This
          synod ordains and decrees that henceforth sacred Scripture, and
          especially the aforesaid old and vulgate edition, be printed in
          the most correct manner possible; and that it shall not be
          lawful for any one to print, or cause to be printed, any books
          whatever on sacred matters without the name of the author; or in
          future to sell them, or even to possess them, unless they shall
          have been first examined and approved of by the ordinary." When
          the question of the translation of the Bible into the vernacular
          came up, Bishop Acqui of Piedmont and Cardinal Pacheco advocated
          its prohibition. This was strongly opposed by Cardinal Madruzzi,
          who claimed that "not the translations but the professors of
          Hebrew and Greek are the cause of the confusion in Germany; a
          prohibition would produce the worst impression in Germany." As
          no agreement could be had, the council appointed an
          index-commission to report to the pope, who was to give an
          authoritative decision.

    2. Rules of Various Popes.

          The first index published by a pope (Paul IV), in 1559,
          prohibited under the title of Biblia prohibita a number of Latin
          editions as well as the publication and possession of
          translations of the Bible in German, French, Spanish, Italian,
          English, or Dutch, without the permission of the sacred office
          of the Roman Inquisition (Reusch, ut sup., i, 264). In 1584 Pius
          IV published the index prepared by the commission mentioned
          above. Herein ten rules are laid down, of which the fourth reads
          thus: "Inasmuch as it is manifest from experience that if the
          Holy Bible, translated into the vulgar tongue, be
          indiscriminately allowed to every one, the rashness of men will
          cause more evil than good to arise from it, it is, on this
          point, referred to the judgment of the bishops or inquisitors,
          who may, by the advice of the priest or confessor, permit the
          reading of the Bible translated into the vulgar tongue by
          Catholic authors, to those persons whose faith and piety they
          apprehend will be augmented and not injured by it; and this
          permission must be had in writing. But if any shall have the
          presumption to read or possess it without such permission, he
          shall not receive absolution until he have first delivered up
          such Bible to the ordinary." Regulations for booksellers follow,
          and then: "Regulars shall neither read nor purchase such Bibles
          without special license from their superiors." Sixtus V
          substituted in 1590 twenty-two new rules for the ten of Pius IV.
          Clement VIII abolished in 1596 the rules of Sixtus, but added a
          "remark" to the fourth rule given above, which particularly
          restores the enactment of Paul IV. The right of the bishops,
          which the fourth rule implies, is abolished by the "remark," and
          the bishop may grant a dispensation only when especially
          authorized by the pope and the Inquisition (Reusch, ut sup., i,
          333). Benedict XIV enlarged, in 1757, the fourth rule thus: "If
          such Bible-versions in the vernacular are approved by the
          apostolic see or are edited with annotations derived from the
          holy fathers of the Church or from learned and Catholic men,
          they are permitted." This modification of the fourth rule was
          abolished by Gregory XVI in pursuance of an admonition of the
          index-congregation, Jan. 7, 1836, "which calls attention to the
          fact that according to the decree of 1757 only such versions in
          the vernacular are to be permitted as have been approved by the
          apostolic see or are edited with annotations," but insistence is
          placed on all those particulars enjoined by the fourth rule of
          the index and afterward by Clement VIII (Reusch, ut sup., ii,
          852).

    3. Rules and Practice in Different Countries.

          In England the reading of the Bible was made by Henry VIII
          (1530) to depend upon the permission of the superiors. Tyndale's
          version, printed before 1535, was prohibited. In 1534 the
          Canterbury convocation passed a resolution asking the king to
          have the Bible translated and to permit its reading. A folio
          copy of Coverdale's translation was put into every church for
          the benefit of the faithful, and fastened with a chain. In Spain
          the Inquisitor-General de Valdes published in 1551 the index of
          Louvain of 1550, which prohibits "Bibles (New and Old
          Testaments) in the Spanish or other vernacular" (Reusch, ut
          sup., i, 133). This prohibition was abolished in 1778. The
          Lisbon index of 1824 in Portugal prohibited quoting in the
          vernacular in any book passages from the Bible. In Italy the
          members of the order of the Jesuits were in 1596 permitted to
          use a Catholic Italian translation of the Gospel-lessons. In
          France the Sorbonne declared, Aug. 26,1525, that a French
          translation of the Bible or of single books must be regarded as
          dangerous under conditions then present; extant versions were
          better suppressed than tolerated. In the following year, 1526,
          it prohibited the translation of the entire Bible, but permitted
          the translation of single books with proper annotations. The
          indexes of the Sorbonne, which by royal edict were binding,
          after 1544 contained the statement: "How dangerous it is to
          allow the reading of the Bible in the vernacular to unlearned
          people and those not piously or humbly disposed (of whom there
          are many in our times) may be seen from the Waldensians,
          Albigenses, and Poor Men of Lyons, who have thereby lapsed into
          error and have led many into the same condition. Considering the
          nature of men, the translation of the Bible into the vernacular
          must in the present be regarded therefore as dangerous and
          pernicious" (Reusch, ut sup., i, 151). The rise of Jansenism in
          the seventeenth century, and especially the appearance, under
          its encouragement, of Quesnel's New Testament with moral
          reflections under each verse (Le Nouveau Testament en françois
          avec des reflexions moroles sur chaque vers, Paris, 1699), which
          was expressly intended to popularize the reading of the Bible,
          caused the renewal, with increased stringency, of the rules
          already quoted. The Jesuits prevailed upon Clement XI to publish
          the famous bull Unigenitus, Sept. 8, 1713, in which he condemned
          seven propositions in Quesnel's work which advocated the reading
          of the Bible by the laity (cf. H. J. D. Denzinger, Enchiridion,
          Würzburg, 1854, 287). In the Netherlands, Neercassel, bishop of
          Emmerich, published in 1677 (in Latin) and 1680 (in French) a
          treatise in which he dealt with the fourth rule of the
          Tridentine index as obsolete, and urged the diligent reading of
          the Bible. In Belgium in 1570 the unlicensed sale of the Bible
          in the vernacular was strictly prohibited; but the use of the
          Antwerp Bible continued. In Poland the Bible was translated and
          often published. In Germany papal decrees could not very well be
          carried out and the reading of the Bible was not only not
          prohibited, but was approved and praised. Billuart about 1750,
          as quoted by Van Ess, states, "In France, Germany, and Holland
          the Bible is read by all without distinction." In the nineteenth
          century the clergy took great interest in the work of Bible
          Societies. Thus [138]Leander van Ess acted as agent of the
          British and Foreign Bible Society for Catholic Germany, and the
          society published the New Testament of Van Ess, which was placed
          on the Index in 1821. The princes-bishop of Breslau, Sedlnitzki,
          who afterward joined the Evangelical Church, was also interested
          in circulating the Bible. As the Bible Societies generally
          circulated the translations of heretics, the pope--Leo XII (May
          5, 1824); Pius VIII (May 25, 1829); Gregory XVI (Aug. 15, 1840;
          May 8, 1844); Pius IX (Nov. 9, 1846; Dec. 8, 1849)--issued
          encyclicals against the Bible Societies. In the syllabus of 1864
          "socialism, communism, secret societies, . . . and Bible
          Societies" are placed in the same category. As to the effect of
          the papal decrees there is a difference of opinion within the
          Catholic Church. In theory the admonition of Gregory XVI no
          doubt exists, but practise often ignores it.

  IV. The Greek Church.

          The Greek Church knows of no such restriction of use of the
          Bible as that of the Roman Church. Nevertheless the Synod of
          Jerusalem of 1672 answered the first of the four questions:
          "Whether the Holy Scripture can be read by all Christians," in
          the negative. Nicholas I of Russia abolished in 1826 the Bible
          Society founded by Alexander I for the propagation of the Bible
          in the Russian vernacular.

  V. The Evangelical Churches.

          Luther strove to open the Bible to all, and his version served
          that purpose. The principle that every Evangelical Christian is
          at liberty to read the Bible remained uncontroverted, though
          Semler (De antiquo ecclesiæ statu commentatio, 37, 60, 68) makes
          the assertion that the sacred writings, especially the apostolic
          epistles, were not intended for the use of the people and the
          congregations; that in the ancient Church no universal use of
          the Bible existed, and that the catechumens especially were
          prohibited from using the Bible. Bible-compendiums for special
          purposes and separate circles also came into use in the
          Evangelical Church. Veit Dietrich published in 1541 his
          Summarium of the Old and the New Testament; Cromwell's soldiers
          had The Soldier's Pocket Bible of 1643 (facsimile edition,
          Cromwell's Soldier's Bible, London, 1895). The restriction upon
          Bible-reading in the Evangelical Church became of practical
          importance only in the schools. For didactic purposes Amos
          Comenius recommended compendiums and special manuals of
          Scripture, which the scholar was to use till he could read the
          Gospel in the original. The didactic needs were gradually
          satisfied by the introduction of text-books of "Biblical
          history," the Catechism, and collections of Bible sentences.
          From time to time the question has been agitated whether the
          whole Bible or so-called school Bibles should be used in the
          schools. The principal reason adduced in favor of the latter is
          that certain passages are objectionable because they deal with
          sexual relations. But these reasons are not well founded, since
          reading of the Bible has never been a cause of demoralization.
          The moral earnestness which without veiling calls things by
          their right names is to be preferred to a careful paraphrasing
          and veiling of the sense which only the more excite impure
          desires.

          Bible societies are benevolent associations formed to increase
          the circulation of the Bible and making special efforts to
          supply the Scriptures to those who from poverty or other causes
          are destitute of them. Printing the Bible or New Testament in
          suitable styles, translation into all important languages and
          even into the less important dialects, and some effective system
          of distribution in all accessible places are commonly regarded
          as essential features of the work of such societies. In some
          cases the books are given without price; but it is not usual to
          give away a large proportion. The test of manufacture and of
          distribution, however, has to be provided by voluntary
          contributions.

          The [139]Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge,
          founded in London in 1698, was the first to undertake to provide
          the common people with the Bible. It continues this beneficent
          work as one branch of its publication enterprise, and has been
          the means of providing fairly good translations of the
          Scriptures in many obscure languages of Asia, Africa, and the
          Pacific Islands. The [140]Society for the Propagation of the
          Gospel, founded in 1701, has also done and is still doing a good
          work in circulating the Scriptures in connection with its
          extensive missions. The Scottish Society for Propagating
          Christian Knowledge, founded in 1709, added the work of
          circulating the Bible to its missionary enterprises in Scotland
          and in America. The first society formed for the exclusive
          purpose of publishing the Bible at a low price seems to have
          been the Canstein Bible Institute, established in 1710 at Halle
          in Germany by Baron Canstein (see below, [141]II, 1).

I. British Bible Societies.

  1. Precursors of the British and Foreign Bible Society.

          In the last half of the eighteenth century several societies
          sprang up in Great Britain which had Bible distribution as part
          of their programme; such as the Book Society for Promoting
          Religious Knowledge among the Poor (1750), the Bible Society,
          later known as the Naval and Military Bible Society (1780), the
          Society for the Support and Encouragement of Sunday Schools
          (1785), the Association for Discountenancing Vice and Promoting
          the Knowledge and Practise of the Christian Religion
          (established in Dublin, 1792), the French Bible Society
          (established in London for printing the Bible in France, 1792),
          and the Religious Tract Society (London, 1799; see [142]Tract
          Societies).

  2. The British and Foreign Bible Society.

    1. Origin and Constitution.

          These enterprises, however, did not supply the need. The
          [143]Rev. Thomas Charles of Bala in Wales became much impressed
          with the need of the common folk about him, who could not obtain
          the Bible except by persevering effort and much self-denial; the
          Bible was not only scarce but costly. Mr. Charles finally
          devoted himself to finding some effective means of supplying his
          people with the Scriptures. At a meeting of the Religious Tract
          Society in London in 1802, he aroused great interest by his
          vigorous presentation of the need of the people of Wales. The
          Rev. Joseph Hughes, secretary of the Religious Tract Society,
          exclaimed, "Surely a society might be formed to provide Bibles
          for Wales; and if for Wales, why not for the world?" This remark
          contained the germ from which grew the British and Foreign Bible
          Society.

          The idea of a Bible Society for the world led to discussion and
          to study of the destitution of the people. The Rev. C. F. A.
          Steinkopf, pastor of the German Lutheran Church in London, gave
          effective information of the situation in European countries.
          Members of the Religious Tract Society, although they did not
          publicly appear, had much to do with the preparatory work. On
          Mar. 7, 1804, a public meeting was held at the London Tavern, on
          the call of Mr. Hughes. Three hundred persons attended the
          meeting. It was quickly evident that a society for increasing
          the circulation of the Bible presented common ground, upon which
          all sects and parties could stand. Dissenters met churchmen, and
          in their interest in the needs of the masses, they forgot for a
          time their divergent interpretations of the same book. The sole
          condition necessary to union of action was that a text accepted
          by all should be issued without note or comment.

          At this meeting a hastily drawn up set of by-laws was adopted.
          An executive committee of thirty-six laymen was chosen, fifteen
          from the Church of England, fifteen from the Dissenting bodies,
          and six foreigners residing in London. The Rev. Joseph Hughes
          (Baptist) and the Rev. Josiah Pratt (Church of England) were
          elected secretaries. Seven hundred pounds were subscribed for
          the work of the society, and the Bishop of London, Dr. Porteus,
          was elected President.

          The constitution of the society was soon afterward prepared; the
          Rev. John Owen, of the Church of England, was added to the staff
          of the society as a third secretary, and on nomination of Lord
          Teignmouth, a former governor-general in India, the Rev. C. F.
          A. Steinkopf was appointed secretary for foreign lands. Besides
          the Bishop of London, the Bishops of Durham, Exeter, and St.
          Davids, and many other influential persons, among whom were
          William Wilberforce and Granville Sharp, long known as
          antislavery leaders, joined this movement.

    2. Present Organization.

          As at present organized, the business of the society is directed
          by a committee made up as indicated above. Every subscriber of
          five guineas annually is a governor, and every subscriber of one
          guinea annually is a member of the society. Every governor, and
          every minister who is a member, has the privilege of attending
          and voting at all meetings of the committee. The president, the
          vice-presidents (numbering more than a hundred), and the
          treasurer are considered ex officio members of the committee.
          There are two secretaries and three superintendents charged with
          different departments of the work besides several assistant
          secretaries. To excite wider interest and to facilitate the
          distribution of the Bible, auxiliary and branch societies are
          formed, which pay their collections into a common fund and
          receive back a certain proportion of the sum collected in Bibles
          for distribution. There were in 1906 more than 5,800 of the
          auxiliary and branch societies and associations in England and
          Wales alone.

          The society began its career by first meeting the wants of
          Wales. Twenty thousand Welsh Bibles and five thousand Testaments
          were printed. Providentially but a short time before this, the
          art of stereotyping had been invented. When in 1806 the first
          wagon-load of Bibles came into Wales, it was received like the
          ark of the covenant; and the people with shouts of joy dragged
          it into the city. The society also distributed the Bible in an
          improved Gaelic translation in the Highlands of Scotland, and
          turned its attention to the Irish; in short, it undertook to
          supply Great Britain and Ireland with Bibles.

    3. Foreign Work.

          But the society did not forget that it is a foreign as well as a
          British Bible Society. When it began operations Europe was
          convulsed with war and not so much was done as would otherwise
          have been accomplished in the way of supplying the destitute in
          European countries. Mr. Steinkopf and Robert Pinkerton made
          extensive tours through Germany, Switzerland, and Russia, and
          everywhere local Bible societies sprang into existence in their
          wake. Many of these societies, formed in 1812 and later, have
          done good work, being aided with funds and with grants of Bibles
          by the British Society. About the time of the formation of the
          British Society two Scotchmen, John Paterson and Ebenezer
          Henderson, went to Copenhagen, intending to go out as
          missionaries to India under the Danish-Halle mission at
          Tranquebar. Their plan fell through, but they met an Icelander,
          Thorkelin, in Copenhagen, who told them of the destitution of
          his countrymen. There were said to be only fifty Bibles in
          Iceland for a population of fifty thousand. The two Scotchmen
          laid the matter before the British and Foreign Bible Society,
          which promised to pay half of the expense of printing five
          thousand Testaments in Icelandic. The printing was stopped by
          the outbreak of war. But in 1812 Mr. Henderson received
          permission to remain in Copenhagen to complete the printing of
          the whole Bible in Icelandic, and, notwithstanding the war, to
          correspond with the Bible society in England regarding this
          work. The confidence thus shown in the motives of the society
          was certainly remarkable at that epoch; and it had much to do
          with the founding of the Danish Bible Society in 1814.

          The British Society extended its work gradually to the British
          colonies, where it works through auxiliary societies. In Canada,
          the Canadian Bible Society, which has united a large number of
          local auxiliaries in one, is a society auxiliary to the British
          Society, and has a secretary appointed by the parent society in
          London. In Australia the society has fifty-two auxiliaries with
          nearly 500 branches. In India, with the exception of Burma, the
          society carries on its work through six strong auxiliary
          societies. In Cape Colony the South-African auxiliary has for
          its field the whole territory south of the Orange River. The
          whole number of auxiliaries and branch societies affiliated with
          the British Society outside of the United Kingdom exceeds 2,200.
          The whole number of these local societies, in Great Britain and
          abroad, which the British and Foreign Society aids and from
          which it receives donations, is over 8,160. Besides these
          auxiliary societies the parent society makes use of agencies,
          each in charge of a special agent, devoted to the increase of
          the circulation of the Bible in his own field. These agencies
          cover the continent of Europe, and Turkey, Siberia, China,
          Korea, and Japan in Asia. In the three last-named countries
          special arrangements with the American Bible Society and the
          National Bible Society of Scotland prevent clashing and secure
          combination for the translation of the Scriptures. Agencies of
          the British society also promote the distribution of the Bible
          in Egypt and North Africa and in nearly all of the colonies of
          East and West Africa. Where neither auxiliary nor agency has
          been established the society works through the missions which
          are in occupation of the ground in any part of the world.

    4. Dissensions. Seceding Societies.

          This wide-spread work has not been brought to its present
          extension without hindrances and difficulties. The High-church
          party in the Church of England has at times opposed the Bible
          Society, preferring to work through the Society for the
          Promotion of Christian Knowledge, which takes care to have the
          Bible supplemented by the Book of Common Prayer. Others have
          insisted that the Bible is a dangerous book to put in the hands
          of ignorant men without note or comment, and for this reason
          have opposed the Bible Society. In 1825 dissension arose within
          the Bible Society, which continued during two years, over the
          question of the Apocrypha. It was formally resolved in 1827 that
          the fundamental law of the society forbids its circulating the
          Apocrypha, and that therefore no persons or societies that
          circulate the Apocrypha can receive aid from the society. This
          decision led to the separation of a considerable number of
          European societies from the British society which had founded
          them. The discussion also resulted in the secession of the
          Scottish societies which originated the agitation against the
          publication of the Apocrypha (see below, [144]3). In 1831
          another agitation was raised against the presence of Unitarians
          on the Board of Managers. The society having refused to alter
          its constitution so as to exclude non-Trinitarians, a separate
          society called the Trinitarian Bible Society was formed (see
          below, [145]5). With the growth of foreign missions, a question
          as to translation of the words relating to baptism became acute;
          and the controversy finally led to the formation of the Bible
          Translation Society, which was supported by Baptists who
          preferred to translate "immerse" rather than to transfer the
          Greek word baptizein (see below, [146]6).

          But there has been a continuous and remarkable growth of the
          society in spite of all obstacles and opposition. In 1904 the
          centenary of the society was celebrated in almost all countries
          of the Christian and non-Christian world. "Bible Day" in Mar.,
          1904, will long be remembered not only as a day of an immense
          popular declaration of faith in the Bible as the revelation of
          God's will to men, but as a time for expressing the warmest love
          and sympathy, and gratitude withal, to the society which then
          completed a hundred years of self-sacrificing service of the
          nations. Not only were special gifts sent into the treasury for
          the general work of the society, but a special centenary fund of
          $1,256,000 was raised in that and the following year to be used
          as a reserve for more firmly planting the outposts of the
          society. The total issues of the British and Foreign Bible
          Society, in the year ending Mar. 31, 1908, amounted to 5,416,569
          copies of the Bible or its parts. The total issues of the
          society from its organization to Mar. 31, 1907, amount to
          203,931,768 copies, of which more than 80,000,000 copies were in
          the English language. The president of the British and Foreign
          Bible Society is the Marquis of Northampton. Its headquarters
          are at 146 Queen Victoria St., London, E. C.; its periodicals
          are The Bible in the World and The Bible Society Gleanings.

  3. The National Bible Society of Scotland.

          In 1809 the Edinburgh Bible Society was formed, in 1812 the
          Glasgow Bible Society, and in 1821 the Glasgow Auxiliary Bible
          Society. As mentioned above, these societies seceded from the
          British and Foreign Bible Society in consequence of the
          controversy about circulating editions of the Bible containing
          the Apocrypha. In 1859 the National Bible Society was formed,
          and in 1861 all these Scottish societies combined to form a new
          organization which was incorporated as the National Bible
          Society of Scotland. The fields of this society are in Europe
          and Asia. One-fifth of its issues in 1906-1907 were in Roman
          Catholic countries and about one-half in China. Its issues in
          the year ending Mar., 1907, amounted to 1,671,900 copies.

  4. The Hibernian Bible Society.

          This society was organized in 1806 as an auxiliary to the
          British and Foreign Bible Society. It is now independent, and
          devotes its attention mainly to the needs of Ireland. In the
          year ending Mar., 1907, it circulated 37,258 copies, which were
          purchased by the society. The headquarters are in Dublin.

  5. The Trinitarian Bible Society.

          Formed in 1831 as a protest against Unitarianism, this society
          issued in the year ending Dec. 31, 1907, 89,214 copies of the
          Bible or its parts. The headquarters of the society are at 7
          Bury St., London, W. C.

  6. The Bible Translation Society.

          This society was organized in 1843 to serve the special
          interests of the British Baptist missions. It is now a part of
          the Baptist Missionary Society, making no separate publication
          of its issues, and having its headquarters at the Mission House,
          19 Furnival St., London.

II. Bible Societies on the Continent of Europe.

  1. Germany.

          The first German Bible Society was the Canstein Bible Institute,
          founded in Halle in 1710 by Karl Hildebrand, [147]Baron
          Canstein, with the definite purpose of placing the Bible within
          reach of the poor. The Institute has issued up to the beginning
          of 1907, over 7,000,000 copies of the Bible and its parts. The
          issues for 1907 were 38,696 copies. The (first) Nuremberg Bible
          Society was formed in 1804, and received aid from the British
          and Foreign Bible Society. In 1806 it was removed to Basel in
          Switzerland and took the name of the Basel Bible Society. Its
          issues during the year 1906 amounted to 32,708 copies. The
          Berlin Bible Society was formed in 1806 as a result of the
          energy of Father Jänicke, a Moravian pastor, and was aided by
          the British and Foreign Bible Society in its early years. In
          1814 it was converted into the Prussian Bible Society. It now
          has many branches and devotes its attention mainly to the
          circulation of the Bible in Germany. In the year 1906 its issues
          amounted to 212,911 Bibles and Testaments. The headquarters of
          the society are Klosterstrasse 71, Berlin C. The Württemberg
          Bible Institute was formed in 1813 under the influence of
          Messrs. Steinkopf and Pinkerton, of the British and Foreign
          Bible Society. Its issues reported in 1906 were 334,953 copies.
          The headquarters are at Christophstrasse 6, Stuttgart. The Berg
          Bible Society was formed at Elberfeld in the old Duchy of Berg
          in 1814. It furnishes Scriptures for use abroad in some small
          quantities. The total of its issues in 1906 was 151,558 copies,
          and the total of its issues in the 93 years of its existence are
          2,228,353 copies. The headquarters of the society are at
          Marienstrasse 28, Elberfeld. The Saxon Bible Society was formed
          in the year 1814. It has forty-two branches, and besides its
          publications in German, it has published an edition of the New
          Testament in the Chagga language, spoken in the northern part of
          German East Africa. Its total issues in 1906 amounted to 48,065
          copies. The headquarters are at Zinzendorfstrasse 17, Dresden.
          The Bavarian Protestant Bible Society was formed in 1823. It is
          also called the Central Bible Society. Its issues in 1906 were
          12,930 copies. The headquarters of the society are at Nuremberg.
          There are also many local and state societies, of which those of
          Hamburg, Sleswick, and Strasburg print as well as distribute
          Bibles. A Roman Catholic Bible Society, the Regensburg Bible
          Institute, was organized in 1805 by G. M. Wittmann, head of the
          seminary at Regensburg, with the assistance of some bishops and
          many laymen. A translation of the New Testament was prepared and
          60,000 copies were distributed in ten years, but in 1817 the
          Institute was suppressed by Pope Pius VII. In 1815 another Roman
          Catholic Bible Society was founded at Heiligenstadt, which
          connected itself with the Prussian society and organized
          auxiliaries. [148]Leander van Ess at Marburg was especially
          interested and his translation of the New Testament was widely
          disseminated. He also founded the Christian Brotherhood for
          Disseminating the Holy Scriptures with the support of the
          British and Foreign Bible Society. The Heiligenstadt society
          flourished till 1830 and maintained an existence till 1864, but
          received its support chiefly from Protestants after the former
          date. The translation of the New Testament made by [149]J. E.
          Gossner was also circulated by the English society.

  2. France.

          The French Bible Society (London) referred to above began the
          Bible movement in France, but the outbreak of the Revolution
          prevented the circulation of French Bibles printed with English
          money. The Protestant Bible Society of Paris was formed in 1818,
          and received aid from the British and Foreign Bible Society for
          a time. The subsidy was withdrawn after a few years because the
          Paris Society included the Apocrypha in its Bibles. The issues
          of this society in 1906 were 8,061 copies. A sharp controversy
          among the French Protestants respecting the French version led
          in 1864 to the formation of the Bible Society of France. This
          society excluded the Apocrypha from its Bibles and held to the
          version of [150]J. F. Osterwald of which it is now publishing a
          new revision. It has received aid from the American Bible
          Society, and it circulates the Bible in the French colonies in
          Asia and Africa. Its issues in 1906 were 34,556 copies.

  3. The Netherlands.

          The Netherlands Bible Society was formed in 1814. Its issues in
          the year 1904 amounted to 93,977 copies, of which 57,573 copies
          were sent abroad to the Dutch East Indies, Dutch Guiana, and
          South Africa. The headquarters of the society are at
          Heerengracht 366, Amsterdam.

  4. Scandinavia.

          The Danish Bible Society was organized in 1814. Its circulation
          in 1906 amounted to 45,289 copies. The Norwegian Bible Society
          was formed in 1816 under the influence of the British and
          Foreign Bible Society. Its issues in 1904 were 63,300 copies, of
          which 751 copies were sent to Denmark, and 11,041 copies to the
          United States of America. Its total issues in eighty-eight years
          ending Dec. 31, 1904, were 1,153,260 copies. The headquarters of
          the society are at Christiania. The Swedish Bible Society was
          organized in 1814. Its circulation in 1906 was 12,414 copies and
          its total circulation from the beginning, 1,242,515 copies, of
          which 666 were in the Lapp language.

  5. Russia.

          The Russian Bible Society with Imperial Sanction was formed in
          1863. It circulates the Bible in Russian and other languages
          under the supervision of the Holy Synod. Its reports show the
          contributions of the czar and czarina and the grand dukes, but
          do not specify clearly the circulation. It makes use of
          colporteurs and seems to do serious work. A Russian Bible
          Society formed in 1812 did an important work in Bible
          translation, but was suppressed by imperial ukase in 1826. The
          Russian Evangelical Bible Society was organized in 1831 for the
          purpose of circulating the Bible among Lutherans and in the
          German language. Its circulation in 1904 was 22,219 copies. The
          Finnish Bible Society was formed in 1812 and its issues in 1903
          were about 30,000 copies.

  6. Switzerland.

          The Basel Bible Society, transferred to Basel from Nuremberg,
          has been mentioned above ([151]II, 1). Local Bible societies
          exist in many of the cantons of Switzerland. They seem, however,
          to be merely agents of distribution receiving Bibles from other
          societies, notably from the British and Foreign Bible Society.
          Their circulation is therefore included in that of the other
          societies.

III. Bible Societies in America.

  1. The American Bible Society.

          The Revolutionary War produced a great scarcity of Bibles in the
          United States. One year after the Declaration of Independence
          Congress was memorialized to authorize the printing of an
          edition of the Bible. This memorial was referred to a committee,
          who found the difficulties, especially, of procuring proper
          material, type, and paper, to be so great that Congress ordered
          the importation at its own expense of 20,000 English Bibles from
          Holland, England, or elsewhere. The scarcity still continuing,
          in 1782 Congress recommended to the people of the United States
          an edition of the Bible printed by Thomas Aitken, of
          Philadelphia, "being satisfied of the care and accuracy of the
          execution of the work." It was not until 1808 that the first
          Bible Society was organized in Philadelphia. In 1809 societies
          were organized in Connecticut, Massachusetts, New York, and New
          Jersey in the order named and by 1816 there were 128 such
          societies.

    1. Organization.

          The idea of uniting these societies is one organization was a
          natural one and was much discussed. The missionary travels of
          the [152]Rev. Samuel J. Mills in the West and South, reported in
          religious periodicals, increased the desire for a national
          organization, which he strongly advocated. On Jan. 1, 1816,
          [153]Elias Boudinot, the president of the New Jersey Bible
          Society, made a public communication on the subject, and on Jan.
          17 he issued a circular letter appointing Wednesday, May 8,
          1816, as the time for holding a convention for, this purpose in
          New York. Sixty delegates representing twenty-eight Bible
          societies (besides several other persons admitted to seats in
          the convention) met on the day named in the Garden Street
          Collegiate Reformed Dutch Church, representing the Presbyterian,
          Congregational, Methodist, Episcopal, Dutch Reformed, and
          Baptist Churches, and the Society of Friends. The convention was
          in session for two days, adopted a constitution and in
          accordance therewith elected managers, who met in the City Hall,
          May 11, and elected officers, Elias Boudinot being made
          president.

    2. Constitution and Management.

          Under this constitution "the sole object shall be to encourage a
          wider circulation of the Holy Scriptures without note or
          comment" (art. i). The board of managers is composed of
          thirty-six laymen, one-fourth of whom go out of office every
          year, but are eligible for re-election. Every clergyman who is a
          life member may meet and vote with the board of managers,
          provided he receives no salary or compensation for services from
          the society. The managers meet regularly every month, consider
          and act on all matters presented by ten standing committees
          besides other matters originating in the board itself and report
          all their proceedings to the annual meeting of the members of
          the society held on the second Thursday of May and usually in
          New York.

          The society was incorporated in 1841. The societies which
          already existed became for the most part auxiliary to the
          national organization and in addition many other auxiliary
          societies were organized under its direction, the number at one
          time reaching 2,200. Many of these, however, have ceased to
          exist, the number now being 541. The "Bible House," Astor Place,
          N. Y., the society's headquarters, was erected in 1852 and was
          paid for by funds contributed for the special purpose and not
          from current receipts for benevolent work.

    3. Summary of Work.

          The ninety-first annual report of the board of managers was
          presented May 9, 1907. The total cash receipts were $575,820.94.
          The total issues of that year were 1,910,853, of which 1,010,777
          were issued from the Bible House in New York, and 900,076 from
          the society's agencies abroad, being printed on mission presses
          in China, Japan, Siam, Syria, and Turkey. The total issues of
          the society in Bibles, Testaments, and portions amount to
          80,420,382 copies, distributed se follows: Bibles 20,293,636
          Testaments and portions 58,215,889.

    4. Foreign Work.

          The efforts of the society were at first directed mainly to
          meeting the needs of the people of the United States, but from
          the very first it was in spirit and intention a foreign as well
          as a home mission society. Bibles at the very beginning were
          supplied to the North-American Indians. The third annual report
          shows that steps were already taken for sending Spanish Bibles
          to Buenos Ayres and the next year the society was reaching out
          to West Africa. In 1836 the first foreign agency was instituted
          in Constantinople, and in 1864 the agency for the La Plata
          region in South America. During the past thirty years this work
          has largely increased and regular agencies have been established
          in Japan, China, Brazil, Mexico, Korea, Cuba, Siam and Laos,
          Central America, Porto Rico and the Philippines, besides
          Venezuela and Colombia, where the agencies have been temporarily
          discontinued. These agencies have distributed a total of
          9,453,918 Bibles, Testaments, and portions in China alone.
          Besides this the society has continually cooperated with
          missions and missionaries in countries in all quarters of the
          globe. It has stimulated Bible translation, initiating it in
          some cases, cooperating with others more frequently and securing
          needed revisions under its patronage and partly or wholly at its
          expense. It has been thus interested in about 100 translations
          and revisions in all.

    5. Controversies.

          The labors of the society have been broken twice by serious
          differences among its friends and supporters. In 1835
          missionaries in Burma published at the expense of the society a
          translation of the New Testament which rendered the Greek word
          baptizein and its cognate terms by the English "immerse" or an
          equivalent. After much discussion the managers resolved that
          they felt at liberty "to encourage only such versions as conform
          in the principle of their translation to the common English
          Version--at least so far as that all the religious denominations
          represented in this society can consistently use and circulate
          such versions in their several schools and communities," and
          missionary boards were requested in asking aid to state that the
          versions they proposed to circulate were in accordance with this
          resolution. The Baptists took offense and a controversy ensued,
          the consequence of which was the formation of the American and
          Foreign Bible Society (see below, [154]2).

          In 1847 the committee on versions was instructed to undertake a
          careful collation of different editions of the English Bible
          with a view to perfecting its text in minutiæ. Their final
          report, made May 1, 1851, stated that in collating five standard
          copies of English and American imprint with the original edition
          of 1611 nearly 24,000 variations were found solely in the text
          and punctuation, not one of which marred the integrity of the
          text or affected any doctrine or precept of the Bible. A
          standard then determined upon with the unanimous approval of the
          board of managers was accepted generally by the public and for
          several years Bibles printed accordingly circulated without the
          slightest objection. But in 1856, and more decidedly in 1857,
          the right of the society to circulate such an edition was
          sharply challenged. Considerable public excitement followed; the
          matter was debated in religious and even secular journals as
          well as in ecclesiastical bodies, and the board of managers
          after long consideration, and debate finally took action, Jan.
          28, 1858, as follows:

          Resolved, that this society's present standard English Bible be
          referred to the standing committee on versions for examination;
          and in all cases where the same differs in the text or its
          accessories from the Bibles previously published by the society,
          the committee are directed to correct the same by conforming it
          to previous editions printed by this society, or by the
          authorized British presses, reference being also had to the
          original edition of the translators printed in 1611; and to
          report such corrections to this board, to the end that a new
          edition, thus perfected, may be adopted as the standard edition
          of the society.

          The committee reported in 1859 and 1860; and from this "standard
          edition" all the society's English Bibles are now printed.

          The constitution of the society originally restricted it to
          circulating only "the version now in common use," in the English
          language. In 1904 at the annual meeting of the society on the
          recommendation of the board of managers the constitution was
          amended so as to permit the publication of the Revised Version
          of the English Bible, either in its British or American form,
          and under this permission some editions of the American Standard
          Revised Version are now published by the society under an
          arrangement with the publishers.

  2. The American and Foreign Bible Society and the American Bible Union.

          The American and Foreign Bible Society was organized at
          Philadelphia in April, 1836, by Baptists who felt aggrieved at
          the action of the American Bible Society concerning the
          translation of the Greek baptizein, referred to above (see
          [155]III, 1, § 5). Rev. S. H. Cone was made president. The
          society was declared to be "founded upon the principle that the
          originals in the Hebrew and Greek are the only authentic
          standards of the Sacred Scriptures, and that aid for the
          translating, printing, or distributing of them in foreign
          languages should be afforded to such versions only as are
          conformed as nearly as possible to the original text; it being
          understood that no words are to be transferred which are
          susceptible of being literally translated." The constitution
          adopted declared (art. ii) "that in the distribution of the
          Scriptures in the English language, the commonly received
          version shall be used until otherwise directed by the society."
          Dissatisfaction with this policy led to the secession of certain
          members and the formation in 1850 of the American Bible Union,
          which demanded that the principle of circulating "such versions
          only as are conformed as nearly as possible to the original
          text" should be applied to the English version, and avowed as
          its object "to procure and circulate the most faithful versions
          of the Sacred Scriptures in all languages throughout the world."
          The Union secured the services of a number of Baptist and other
          Biblical scholars, especially the Rev. Drs. H. B. Hackett, A. C.
          Kendrick, and T. J. Conant. The entire New Testament and
          portions of the Old were revised and published. Italian,
          Spanish, Chinese (Ningpo colloquial), Siamese, and Sgau-Karen
          New Testaments were also prepared. The Union ultimately reunited
          with the American and Foreign Bible Society, and in 1882 the
          latter passed over its work and good-will to the American
          Baptist Publication Society (Philadelphia), which since then has
          performed the duties of the Bible Society, and is carrying on
          the work of revision inaugurated by the earlier societies. The
          revision has now (1907) reached the Book of Ezra, and will be
          completed, it is hoped, by the end of 1908.

  3. The Bible Association of Friends in America.

          The Bible Association of Friends in America was organized in
          1830. It has been, in the main, a distributing agency,
          circulating the Scriptures printed by others, but in 1905-06
          printed an edition of 2,925 Testaments and Psalms. In 1906 it
          reported total receipts of $3,930.59 and payments of $2,412.06.
          Its distribution in that year was 6,534 volumes, of which 2,030
          were Bibles. The headquarters are at 207 Walnut Place,
          Philadelphia, Pa.

I. The Old Testament.

  1. The Premasoretic Period:

    1. The Masoretic Text.

          The extant Hebrew text of the Old Testament text is commonly
          called the Masoretic, to distinguish it from the text of the
          ancient versions as well as from the Hebrew text of former ages.
          This Masoretic text does not present the original form but a
          text which within a certain period was fixed by Jewish scholars
          as the correct and only authoritative one. When and how this
          official Masoretic text was fixed was formerly a matter of
          controversy, especially during the seventeenth century. One
          party headed by the Buxtorfs (father and son), in the interest
          of the view of inspiration then prevalent, held to the absolute
          completeness and infallibility, and hence the exclusive value,
          of the Masoretic text. They attributed it to Ezra and the men of
          the Great Synagogue, who, under the inspiration of the Holy
          Spirit, were supposed to have purified the text from all
          accumulated error; added the vowel-points, the accents, and
          other punctuation-marks (thus settling the reading and
          pronunciation); fixed the canon; made the right division into
          verses, paragraphs, and books; and, finally, by the providence
          of God and the care of the Jews, the text thus made was believed
          to have been kept from all error, and to present the veritable
          Word of God. This view of the text prevailed especially when
          Protestant scholasticism was at its height, and may be
          designated as the orthodox Protestant position. It was opposed
          by another party headed by Jean Morin and Louis Cappel, who, in
          the interest of pure historicity or in Antiprotestant polemics,
          combated these opinions, maintained the later age of the
          Masoretic text, and sought to vindicate value and usefulness for
          the old versions and other critical helps. They fell into many
          errors in respect to the details of the history of the text and
          overrated the value of Extramasoretic critical helps; but their
          general view was supported by irresistible arguments and is now
          universally adopted. This view, instead of deriving the existing
          text from a gathering of inspired men in Ezra's time, assigns it
          to a much later date and quite different men, and, instead of
          absolute completeness, claims for it only a relative one with a
          higher value than other forms of the text. A glance at the
          history of the text will show how this agreement has been
          brought about.

    2. The Earlier Text.

          Concerning the oldest history of the text of the Old Testament
          writings there exists almost no positive information. The books
          were written probably upon skins, perhaps also on linen; as
          paper was used from very early times in Egypt, it is possible
          that it was employed; parchment appears to have been used later.
          The roll seems to have been the usual form (Ps. xl, 8; Jer.
          xxxvi, 14 sqq.; Ezek, ii, 9; Zech. v, 1); the pen was a pointed
          reed (Jer. viii, 8; Ps. xiv, 1); the character was the Old
          Hebrew, which was almost identical with the Phenician and
          Moabitic (on the [156]Moabite Stone). Specimens of this writing
          are also preserved in the Siloam inscription (c. 700 B.C.), on
          gems (of the eighth or seventh century), on coins of the
          Hasmoneans and those belonging to the time of the Jewish-Roman
          war, and, in somewhat different form, in Samaritan writings.
          Like the Phenicians and Moabites, the Hebrews separated the
          words by a point or stroke, but these signs do not seem to have
          been used regularly, since the Septuagint often makes
          word-divisions different from those of the Masoretic text.
          Jewish tradition mentions several passages in which the
          separation of words was regarded as doubtful.

          The difference between ancient and modern texts consisted in
          this, that the former were written without vowels and accents.
          The Hebrew writing, like Semitic writing in general, was
          essentially consonantal; vowels were not written. While the
          language lived, this occasioned no difficulty to the speakers or
          readers. No details are at hand concerning the way in which the
          text was multiplied and preserved; but inasmuch as the writings
          did not then have in popular estimation the character they came
          later to possess, it is likely that they were less carefully
          handled, and that the same amount of pains was not taken in
          copying them. This statement rests upon the fact that those
          parts of the Old Testament which we possess in double forms vary
          in ways that indicate a corruption of the text reaching back to
          precanonical times when copies were neither made nor corrected
          so laboriously.

    3. Change in Style of Writing.

          A new epoch commenced after the Exile, when the holy writings
          were raised to canonical dignity and as holy writings were
          venerated and handled with ever-increasing care and
          conscientiousness. This veneration was not accorded to all
          Biblical writing at once, but only to that part of the canon
          called the law. The epoch begins with Ezra, and extends to the
          close of the Talmud, c. 500 A.D. During this period not only
          were the form of writing and the text fixed, but also the
          pronunciation and division; in short, the major part of the
          present Masorah was collected in verbal form. A change of an
          external kind was the development of a sacred writing, under the
          influence of the Aramaic character, the so-called "square" or
          "Assyrian" character. Jewish tradition ascribes the introduction
          of the square character to Ezra, and calls it expressly an
          Aramaic writing that the Jews adopted in place of their Hebrew,
          which they left to the Samaritans. A study of Assyrian, Persian,
          and Cilician seals and coins, of the Aramaic monuments from the
          third to the first century B.C., and of the Palmyrene
          inscriptions from the first to the third century A.D. has
          permitted the tracing of the development of the present Hebrew
          alphabet through a thousand years, back to the eighth century.
          Ezra, therefore, may have influenced the use of the Aramaic
          alphabet, but the square character was not developed in his day,
          nor for centuries afterward; nor was the Aramaic alphabet then
          used outside of the narrow circle of the scribes. For not only
          did the Samaritans retain the ancient script for their
          Pentateuch, but among the Jews also it must have been used for a
          long time, since it is found on coins down to the time of Bar
          Kokba. Matt. v, 18 proves that the Aramaic writing had become
          popular by the time that Gospel was written, since in the
          ancient Hebrew the letter "yodh" was by no means the smallest.
          Taking all in all, it may be assumed with certainty that the use
          of the new alphabet in Bible-manuscripts of the last
          Prechristian centuries was general, a result which is also
          confirmed by a careful examination of the Septuagint with
          reference to the manuscripts used by the translators (especially
          must this have been the case with the Tetragrammaton retained in
          many copies of the Greek translation, which was no doubt written
          in the Aramaic script, since it was read erroneously by the
          Christians). Considering this development it may be assumed that
          the latest Old Testament writings were written, not in the
          ancient Hebrew but in Aramaic, by the authors themselves. After
          the Aramaic writing was once in use among the Jews, it soon took
          the form in which we now have it. The descriptions which Jerome
          and the Talmud give of the different letters fully harmonize
          with the form which is still found in manuscripts. The minute
          rules laid down by the Talmud as to calligraphy and orthography
          made further development of the square writing impossible, and
          therefore the writing of the manuscripts varies scarcely at all
          through centuries (excepting perhaps that the German and Polish
          Jews have the so-called Tam script, which is somewhat angular,
          whereas the Spanish Jews have the Welsh or more rounded script).

    4. Attempts to Fix the Texts.

          The veneration shown for the canonical writings during this
          period naturally led to a greater care in treatment of them and
          above all to perception of the necessity of critically fixing
          the text. As soon as the ancient writings obtained canonical
          authority, were used in divine service, and became the standard
          of doctrine and life, the necessity of having one standard text
          naturally asserted itself. The preparation of such a text began
          with the law; the other two divisions (the prophets and the
          hagiographa) became authoritative only in the course of
          centuries (see [157]Canon of Scripture, I), and naturally their
          text did not receive attention in the earlier period. However,
          criticism during that period was of little value. There is no
          doubt that faithful and correct copies existed, especially of
          such books as were publicly read, but this could not prevent
          errors and mistakes from creeping into copies which were
          generally circulated. When Josephus (Contra Apion, I, viii) and
          Philo (cf. Eusebius, Præparatio evangelica, VIII, vi, 7) speak
          of the great care bestowed by the Jews upon their sacred
          writings, this can not be referred to earlier centuries, and
          concerns more the contents than the linguistic minutiae of the
          text. In the oldest critical documents--the Samaritan Pentateuch
          and the Septuagint--there is evidence (about 500-100 B.C.) to
          show that the manuscripts most approved and most widely diffused
          contained many verbal differences. And these variations are not
          to be charged, as was formerly done, to carelessness or
          wilfulness on the part of the Hellenistic Jews and Samaritans,
          but are explained by the lesser importance attached to exact
          uniformity of text and to the existence of mistakes in the
          current copies. And when the Septuagint and the Samaritan
          Pentateuch agree in good readings, and still oftener in bad
          ones, against the Masoretic text, it may be concluded that these
          readings were spread by many copies current among the
          Palestinian Jews, and are therefore not to be regarded as
          offensive. But after the destruction of Jerusalem, when Judaism
          was subject to the authority of the rabbis, it became possible
          to prepare a uniform standard text, although this idea was not
          realized until many generations had worked upon it. The Greek
          versions of the second century had already fewer variations from
          the Masoretic text. Still nearer the latter text is the Hebrew
          text of Origen and Jerome. The Talmud itself bears witness, by
          the agreement of its Biblical quotations with the Masoretic
          text, that the consonantal text was practically finished before
          the Talmudic era closed. It is not possible to say upon what
          principles the text was treated; but the way in which the
          custodians presented the individuality of the several authors,
          books, and periods is remarkable, and proves that intentional
          and arbitrary changes of the text were not made by these
          critics. That they changed passages for dogmatic, especially for
          Antichristian, reasons, as has sometimes been asserted, has long
          ago been acknowledged to be a baseless accusation. Where they
          mention changes, they make clear than they followed the
          testimony of manuscripts, the number of which was probably not
          very great. The fact that in the first centuries after Christ
          the text approximates our present Masoretic reading shows that a
          certain recension became authoritative which was possible only
          after a certain manuscript had been taken as the norm. Of such a
          standard codex, copies could easily be made, or one could
          correct his own copies in accordance with it. Scholars like
          Olshausen and Lagarde speak therefore of some such archetype,
          which was slavishly followed in every respect. The critical
          apparatus of the time is concealed in dissociated fragments in
          the later Masorah, but can not be separated from the other
          matter. The Talmud and the older midrashim allow a little
          insight into the critical efforts of the time. Thus mention is
          made of the "corrections of the scribes," of the "removals of
          the scribes" (meaning that in five passages a falsely introduced
          "and" was removed), and of the points in the Hebrew text over
          certain words to show that these words were critically
          suspected, such as the inverted "nun," Num. x, 35, and the three
          kinds of reading (k?eri; see [158]Keri and Kethibh), viz., "read
          but not written," "written but not read," and "read [one way]
          but written [another]." The three kinds of reading have, it is
          true, for the most part only exegetical value; e.g., they give
          the usual instead of the unusual grammatical forms, show where
          one must understand or omit a word, or where the reader should
          use a euphemistic expression for the coarse one in the text;
          they are therefore scholia upon the text. It is possible that
          these "readings" are also fragments of the critical apparatus.
          However this may be, it is evident that at that period the text
          was fixed and that the matter in question concerned only
          subordinate details of the text.

    5. The Pronunciation Fixed, but the Text Still Unvocalized.

          The development of the pronunciation or of the vocalization and
          the division of words, verses, and sections kept pace with the
          settlement of the text. That the ancient writing had no
          vowel-points has already been stated; but even during this
          entire period to the close of the Talmud the sacred text was
          without vowels and other points. The old versions, particularly
          the Greek, and Josephus depart so widely from the Masoretic text
          that they could not possibly have used the present pointed text.
          The expedient which charges the translators with these
          differences is of no avail, since it is not any one version
          which alone shows such differences; they all differ. Origen,
          too, published a Hebrew text in the Hexapla which differed from
          the Masoretic. Jerome knew nothing about vowel-points, not even
          the diacritical point making the difference between "s" and
          "sh." The Talmud and the modern ecclesiastical or ritual
          manuscripts of the Jews present an unpointed text. There is no
          doubt that, as Elias Levita stated, the Masoretic system of
          punctuation is of later origin, and that during this entire
          period the sacred text was without points. But this does not
          mean that during the same period the reading of the unvoweled
          text was still unsettled among the Jews; it must rather be
          assumed that with the official fixing of the text there was
          developed also a certain mode of understanding and reading it.
          Of course time was required to bring it into vogue; but before
          the end of the period it was so firmly established that Jerome's
          pronunciation differed very little from the Masoretic, and he
          was so sure of its correctness that he appeals to it against the
          text of the versions; and the Talmud gives it throughout
          correctly. Before the Masoretes the pronunciation was fixed, not
          yet written, but handed down by word of mouth, although some
          scholars may have used signs in their books to assist their
          memory.

    6. Word Division.

          Closely connected and mutually dependent were pronunciation and
          the division of words. The latter must have been finally settled
          at this period. The sign of division was the small space between
          words. The final letters, being limited in number, can not be
          regarded as word-separating signs. Jerome used a text with a
          division of words and knew the final letters; in the Talmud,
          Menahot 30a states how large must be the space between the
          words; the synagogue-scrolls, though still without vowels, have
          nevertheless the division by spaces, following the custom of the
          ancient manuscripts from Talmudic time; and the fact that a
          number of "readings" correct the traditional division of words
          speaks again in favor of the high antiquity of the division of
          words in the present texts.

    7. Division into Verses.

          The division into verses is by no means contemporary in origin
          with the vocalization, but much earlier. The verse division
          depends in poetry upon the parallelism, in prose upon the
          division of sentences and clauses. That the latter were not
          marked in oldest times is certain; in poetical texts the members
          may have been distinguished either by space or by breaks of the
          line. This mode of writing poetical texts was formerly general,
          and is found in the older Hebrew manuscripts; for the poetical
          texts, Ex. xv; Deut. xxxii; Judges v; and II Sam. xxii, it is
          even prescribed (Shabbat 103b; Sopherim xii), and is therefore
          still customary. With the introduction of the Masoretic accents,
          poetry was written close, like prose. This verse-division was
          taught in the schools; but no rules are given for its writing,
          nor did any punctuation-marks indicate it in this period.

    8. Division into Sections.

          Earlier than the division into verses is that into larger or
          smaller sections; these were more necessary for the
          understanding of the Scriptures and for their reading in divine
          worship. Perhaps some of them were in the original text. The
          sections of the law were at least Pretalmudic; for they are
          mentioned in the Mishnah and frequently in the Gemara; in the
          latter they are traced to Mosaic origin; in Shabbat 103b,
          Menahot 30 care is enjoined as to the sections in copying the
          law, and therefore they occur also in synagogue-rolls. They are
          indicated by spacing; the larger sections by leaving the
          remainder of the line at their close unfilled, the next great
          section beginning with a new line, on which account they were
          called "open"; the smaller sections were separated from each
          other by only a small space, and were therefore called "closed"
          or "connected." Thus not only the law but also the other two
          parts of the canon were divided. For the division of the whole
          canon, and the arrangement of the books, see [159]Canon of
          Scripture, I.

          From what has been said, it follows that the reading of the
          text, the vocalization, the division into words, verses, and
          sections depend upon the gradual settlement by the scribes;
          their reading can claim neither infallibility nor any absolutely
          binding power; and though their labor betrays a thorough and
          correct understanding of the text, the necessity may yet arise
          when the exegete must deviate from tradition. Extraordinary
          pains were taken to perpetuate in its purity the text thus
          divided and vocalized. Signs of this care, such as the rules for
          calligraphy and for writing the extraordinary points, have
          already been mentioned. The Posttalmudic treatises Masseket
          sopherim and Masseket sepher torah contain full details for
          copying. Nevertheless fluctuations are met with in the Masoretic
          period, and it must therefore be assumed that learned labor had
          not yet covered all details or made final settlement.

  2. The Masoretic Period:

    1. The Masoretes.

          The third period of the textual history is usually reckoned as
          extending from the sixth until the eleventh Christian century
          (when Jewish learning was transferred from the East to North
          Africa and Spain); it embraces the age of the Masoretes proper,
          and has for the Bible text in general the same importance as the
          Talmudic period had for the law. The efforts of the scholars to
          fix the reading and understanding of the sacred text were
          overshadowed somewhat by the study of the Talmud. After the
          close of the Talmud the work was resumed and cultivated in
          Babylonia and Palestine (at Tiberias). In both schools the work
          of former generations was continued; but the Palestinians, who
          acted more independently than the more Talmudically inclined
          Babylonians, finally got the victory over the Babylonian school.
          In both schools they were no longer satisfied with a mere oral
          transmission of rules and regulations, but committed them to
          writing. There is no continuous history of the men of the
          Masorah and of the progress of their work preserved; but the
          marginal notes in ancient Biblemanuscripts and the fragments of
          other works show that the oldest Masoretes can be traced back to
          the eighth century. The main effort of this period (as the name
          Masorah, "tradition," indicates; see [160]Masorah) was to
          collect and to write down the exegetico-critical material of the
          former period; and this makes sufficiently clear the one part of
          their work. But the Masoretes also added some new matter.
          Anxiously following the footsteps of the older critics in their
          effort to fix and to guard the traditional text, they laid down
          more minute rules of a linguistic and grammatical character, and
          in this respect a great part of the contents of the Masorah is
          indeed new.

    2. Their Work.

          They took the consonantal textus receptus just as it stood, and
          finally settled it in the minutest details, as is seen from the
          variants which became a matter of controversy between the East
          and the West, the Babylonians and the Palestinians, which to the
          number of 216 Jacob ben Hayyim published for the first time in
          the second edition of the Bomberg Rabbinic Bible; these have
          reference mostly to the vowel-points. This list of variants, as
          is now known, is by no means complete. They also appended
          critical notes to the text, in part derived from the Talmudic
          period, in part new (especially the "grammatical conjectures"),
          showing that where, according to the grammar and the genius of
          the language, one should expect another reading, nevertheless
          the text must stand. Finally the great majority of the
          alternative "readings" date from the Masoretes.

          The Masoretes fixed the reading of the text by the introduction
          of the vowel-signs, the accents, and the signs which affect the
          reading of the consonants (daghesh, mappik?, raphe, and the
          diacritical point to distinguish between the letters "sin" and
          "shin"). The pronunciation they thus brought about was no
          invention, but embodied the current tradition. Nevertheless, one
          can not accept every Masoretic reading as infallible and
          unchangeable, especially when one considers that the tradition
          no doubt often fluctuated and that with such fluctuation the
          less correct reading may often have come into the text. Besides
          the system found in the majority of manuscripts, there exists
          another which has only recently become known called the
          "superlinear" system, because the vowel-signs are placed above
          the letters; this is found in some Babylonian and South Arabian
          manuscripts. The same is also the case with the accents.

          The division of the text into verses, introduced by the
          Masoretes, was neither Babylonian nor Palestinian, but one which
          the Masoretes themselves seem to have established. At the
          beginning of this period the end of the verses was marked by
          soph pasuk?, and, when the accents mere introduced, by silluk?,
          besides. The old sections were retained, though not recognized
          as entirely correct, and the old traditional sign for the
          section, the smaller spacing (the little s in printed texts),
          was respected. The closed sections were marked in manuscripts
          and prints by a s, the open ones by a ph in the empty space
          before the initial word. In addition there were introduced the
          Babylonian division into sections or parashiyoth (in the law)
          and haphtaroth (in the prophets), for Sabbath public reading. As
          these sections generally agree with the beginning and the end of
          an open or closed section, they were marked by a threefold ph
          [i.e., phphph] or s? [sss] in the empty space before the
          beginning.

    3. Codices.

          But even these efforts could not entirely remove variations.
          Hence, before the end of this period, the learned either
          attempted to find out by an elaborate comparison the correct
          punctuation and to fix it, or marked the important variations in
          the punctuation, or added a caution to each apparently strange
          and yet correct punctuation. The greater mass of notes which the
          Masoretes added to the text relate to these matters. Besides
          some other Masoretic manuscripts of the Bible which are quoted
          in the Masoretic notes of the codices or in the writings of the
          rabbis as authoritative, such as the codex Hilleli, the
          Jericho-Pentateuch, and others, two codices were especially
          famous as model codices of the Old Testament, the codex of
          Naphtali (Moses ben David ben Naphtali) and the codex of Asher
          (Aaron ben Moses ben Asher), both from the first half of the
          tenth century. (Aaron lived at Tiberias, Moses in Babylon; but
          the latter can not be regarded as a representative of the
          "Babylonian" text-tradition.) They were once much examined by
          scholars; many of their variants are noted in the Masoretic
          Bible-manuscripts; a list of 864 (better 867) variants, which
          refer almost exclusively to vowels and accents, has been
          published after Jacob ben Hayyim in Bomberg's and the other
          Rabbinic Bibles, as well as in the sixth volume of the London
          Polyglot; but these variants are neither correct nor complete.
          On the codex of Asher finally rests the whole Masoretic text of
          the Occidentals; of the variant readings comparatively few were
          received into it.

          As the older scribes had already shown extraordinary solicitude
          for the preservation of the text and its correct reading by
          counting its sections, verses, words, letters, and by noting
          where and how often and when certain words, letters, or
          anomalies occur in the Bible, which verse is the longest and
          which the shortest, and like minutiae, the Masoretes of course
          continued this work, wrote it down, and preserved it in
          manuscripts.

          The punctuation of the text as developed by the Masoretes proved
          itself so useful and met so well an essential need of those
          later times that it soon went over into manuscripts and, with
          the exception of synagogue-manuscripts, almost none were written
          which did not contain either the pointed text alone or the
          pointed beside the unpointed. The other Masoretic material was
          written either beside and below the text of the Biblical books
          on the margins and at the close of the same, or in separate
          masorah-collections (see [161]Masorah).

  3. The Postmasoretic Period.

    1. The Chapter Division.

          After the completion of the Masoretic textual work and the
          collection of the notes having reference to it, no essential
          change was made in the text; consequently this period is the
          time of the faithful preservation, multiplication, and
          circulation of the Masoretic text. An essential innovation was
          the introduction of the now customary division into chapters,
          which was invented by Stephen Langton at the beginning of the
          thirteenth century, and applied to the Vulgate. Isaac ben Nathan
          adopted it for his Hebrew concordance (1437-38, published 1523),
          on which occasion the verses of the chapters were also numbered.
          The chapter-division was first applied to the Hebrew in the
          second edition of Bomberg's Bible, 1521; the numbering of verses
          was first adopted for the Sabionetta Pentateuch, 1557, and that
          of the whole Bible in Athias's edition of 1661 (see below,
          [162]III, §§ 1-2).

    2. Old Testament Manuscripts.

          Another feature of this period is that a sufficient number of
          manuscripts is preserved to give an immediate knowledge of the
          text. The Hebrew Bible-manuscripts may be divided into two
          classes, the public or sacred and the private or common. The
          first were synagogue-rolls, and have been prepared so carefully
          and watched so closely that the intrusion of variants and
          mistakes was hardly possible. But they contain only the
          Pentateuch or the Pentateuch with the five Megilloth or "Rolls"
          (i.e., Song of Solomon, Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes,
          Esther), and the haphtaroth (see above, [163]2, § 1) in the text
          of the Masoretes without their additions. These manuscripts are,
          for the most part, of recent origin, although antique in form,
          being written on leather or parchment. The private manuscripts
          are written on the same material, and also upon paper in book
          form, with the Masoretic additions more or less complete. It is
          often difficult, indeed impossible, to determine the date and
          country of these manuscripts. But none of those now known are
          really very old. The oldest authentic date is 916 A.D. for the
          codex containing the prophets with Babylonian punctuation, and
          1009 A.D. for an entire Hebrew Bible, both of which belong to
          the Firkowitsch collection in the Imperial Library at St.
          Petersburg. According to the most recent investigation the MS.
          orient. 4445 in the British Museum (containing Gen. xxv,
          20-Deut. i, 33) may be a little older. As a rule the oldest
          manuscripts are the more accurate. The number of errors that
          crept in, especially in private manuscripts, which were prepared
          without any official oversight, awakened solicitude and led to
          well-directed efforts to get a pure text by means of collating
          good Masorah-manuscripts (cf. B. Kennicott, Dissertatio
          generalis, Oxford, 1780, l-lvi; J. G. Eichhorn, Einleitung,
          Leipsic, 1803, 136b). In this line the labors of Meïr ha-Levi of
          Toledo (d. 1244) in his work on the Pentateuch called "The
          Masorah, the Hedge of the Law" (Florence, 1750; Berlin, 1761)
          are celebrated.

    3. The Printed Text.

          The art of printing opened a way of escape from copyists'
          errors, and it was taken very early. The Psalter was printed
          first, at Bologna in 1477 [on the earlier prints, cf. B. Pick,
          History of the Printed Editions of the Old Testament, in
          Hebraica, ix (1892-1893), 47-116], the first complete Bible at
          Soncino in 1488; Gerson's edition (the edition which Luther used
          for his translation) followed (Brescia, 1494). Substantially the
          same text is contained in the first edition of Bomberg's
          Rabbinic Bible (1517; see [164]Bibles, Rabbinic), also in the
          editions of Robert Stephens (1539 sqq.) and of Sebastian
          Münster. The second independent edition derived from manuscripts
          is that in the Complutensian Polyglot (1514-17; see [165]Bibles,
          Polyglot, I). The text has vowels but no accents. The third
          important recension is contained in the Biblia Rabbinica
          Bombergiana, ed. II., cura R. Jacob ben Chajim (Venice,
          1525-26); it is edited according to the Masorah, which the
          editor first revised, and contains the entire Masoretic and
          Rabbinic apparatus. It is more or less reproduced in prints
          published during the sixteenth and in the beginning of the
          seventeenth centuries. Besides these original recensions,
          editions were published having a mixed text; the Hebrew text of
          the Antwerp Polyglot (1569-72), which is followed by the small
          editions of Plantin, the Paris and London Polyglots, and the
          editions of Reineccius, is based upon that of the Complutensian
          and Bomberg. Another recension is represented in the editions of
          Elias Hutter (1587), Buxtorf, and Joseph Athias with preface by
          J. Leusden (1661 sqq.), for which some very ancient manuscripts
          were collated. Athias's edition became also the basis of later
          editions like that of Jablonski (1699), Van der Hooght (1705),
          Opits (1709), J. H. Michaelis (1720), Hahn (1832), and Theile
          (1849).

    4. Critical Works and Commentaries.

          None of these editions presents the Masoretic text in its
          original form. The large collections of variants by B.
          Kennicott, Vetus Testamentum Hebraicum cum variis lectionibus (2
          vols., Oxford, 1776-80), more especially by De Rossi, Variæ
          lectiones Veteris Testamenti (4 vols., Parma, 1784-88) and
          Supplementa ad varias sacri textus lectiones (1798), are
          valuable for some Extramasoretic readings which they offer, but
          they are less valuable for critical purposes. More important for
          textcritical purposes are (besides the work of Meïr ha-Levi, ut
          sup.) the "Light of the Law" of Menahem de Lonzano (Venice,
          1618) and particularly the critical commentary on the Old
          Testament by Solomon Minorzi (Mantua, 1742-44; Vienna, 1813),
          the works of Wolf ben Samson Heidenheim, and especially the
          thorough work on the Masorah by S. Frensdorff (Massora magna,
          part I, Hanover, 1878, and Oklah we-Oklah, 1864). Of great
          service were the publication of the works of the oldest Jewish
          grammarians and lexicographers and the discovery of fragments
          and publication of codices like that on the prophets of the year
          916 (published by Strack, Prophetarum posteriorum codex
          Babylonicus Petropolitanus, St. Petersburg, 1876). The fruits of
          these preliminary works are contained in the correct editions of
          the Masoretic text by Baer and Ginsburg. Baer, who was assisted
          by Delitzsch, published the Old Testament with the exception of
          Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy [both editors died
          without completing their work]. Ginsburg's edition is entitled
          The New Massoretico-Critical Text of the Hebrew Bible [2 vols.,
          London, 1894. It should be studied with the same author's
          indispensable Introduction to the Massoretico-critical Edition
          of the Hebrew Bible (London, 1897)].

          Valuable as such correct editions of the Masoretic text are,
          they represent only a single recension, whose source is the
          textus receptus mentioned above, which was fixed in the first
          Christian centuries. With this recession the text-critical and
          exegetical treatment of the Old Testament can not be satisfied.
          Before the received text was made canonical there existed
          different forms of the text, which in many cases stood nearer to
          the original than that sanctioned by the Jews. The main witness
          here is the Septuagint, a correct edition of which is an
          absolutely necessary though extremely difficult task. But Old
          Testament textual criticism can not be satisfied with a
          comparison even with this older form of the text. In many cases
          the corruption of the text is so old that only a criticism both
          cautious and bold can approximate to the genuine text. In modern
          times some very important contributions have been made, such as

II. The New Testament.

  1. History of the Written Text:

    1. The Autographs of the New Testament Books.

          The autographs of the New Testament very early disappeared,
          owing to the constant use of the perishable papyrus; for this
          appears to have been the material (II John 12). If they were
          really not in the handwriting of the apostles, but in that of
          their amanuenses, as Paul's Epistles generally were (Rom. xvi,
          22; II Thess. iii, 17), it is easier to account for the
          phenomenon. The papyrus rolls preserved to the present day were
          never much used; indeed, the most of them have been found in
          sarcophagi, and so, of course, were never used at all. The ink
          was lampblack mixed with gum dissolved in water, copperas
          (sulphate of iron) being sometimes added. The pen was of reed
          (calamus). The writing was entirely in uncials (capitals), with
          no separation of the words (except rarely to indicate the
          beginning of a new paragraph), no breathings, accents, or
          distinction of initial letters, and few, if any, marks of
          punctuation. The evangelists may have denominated their
          compositions "Gospels," although Justin regularly speaks of the
          "Memoirs of the Apostles"; but all addition to the name is
          later, and presupposes a collection of the Gospels. In the case
          of the Epistles the brief address, e.g., "To the Romans," was
          probably added by the original sender, and other marks of
          genuineness given (cf. II Thess. iii, 17). The Muratorian Canon
          (second half of the second century; see [166]Muratorian Canon)
          calls Acts and the Apocalypse by these names, and so proves the
          early use of these designations. The designation "Catholic
          (i.e., General) Epistle" is first met with at the close of the
          second century (Apollonius, in Eusebius, Hist. eccl., V, xviii,
          5, where the First Epistle of John is probably meant). The
          application and limiting of the term to the whole of the present
          collection is of later date; for even in the third and fourth
          century it was customary to give this term to epistles, like
          that of Barnabas or those of Dionysius of Corinth, which were
          not specially addressed.

    2. The Manuscripts.

          The external history of the New Testament text for a thousand
          years prior to the invention of printing can be traced by means
          of manuscripts. Before the formal close of the canon (end of
          fourth century) there were probably few single manuscripts of
          the entire New Testament. Of the three thousand known
          manuscripts of the New Testament, only about thirty include all
          the books. Some of those of the fourth and fifth century now
          preserved contain not only the Greek Old Testament (', A, B, C),
          but also writings which, though not canonical, were read in
          churches and studied by catechumens. Thus, attached to the Codex
          Sinaiticus (') were the Epistle of Barnabas and the Shepherd of
          Hermas; to the Codex Alexandrinus (A), two "epistles" ascribed
          to [167]Clement of Rome and the so-called Psalterium Salomonis.
          The four Gospels were most frequently copied, the Pauline
          Epistles oftener than the Catholic Epistles or the Acts, least
          often the Apocalypse. The Gospels were usually arranged in the
          present order, then came the Pauline Epistles, the Acts, and the
          Catholic Epistles; the Apocalypse always last. The arrangement
          of the Epistles differed; indeed, there was no model. (On the
          various arrangements cf. C. A. Credner, Geschichte des
          neutestamentlichen Kanons, ed. G. Volkmar, Berlin, 1860; C. R.
          Gregory, Prolegomena, Leipsic, 1884, pp. 131 sqq.; T. Zahn,
          Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons, Erlangen, 1883, ii,
          343 sqq.)

    3. Their Material and Form.

          After papyrus had gone out of use, parchment or vellum came in
          and was used from the fourth to the eleventh century; then came
          in cotton paper, and afterward linen paper (cf. W. Wattenbach,
          Das Schriftwesen im Mittelalter, Leipsic, 1896, pp. 139 sqq.).
          The growing scarcity of parchment led to the reuse of the old
          skins, the former writing being erased or washed off; and
          unfortunately it oftener happened that it was a Biblical
          manuscript which was thus turned into a patristic one than the
          reverse. Such manuscripts are termed Codices palimpsesti
          (palimpsests) or rescripti. By the use of chemicals the original
          text has often been recovered in modern times. The most famous
          New Testament palimpsest is the Codex Ephraemi (C), of the fifth
          century, rewritten upon in the twelfth. As papyrus disappeared
          from use, the book form was generally substituted for the rolls,
          in manuscripts written on parchment or paper. The books were
          mostly made up of quaternions, i.e., quires of four sheets,
          doubled so as to make sixteen pages, less frequently of five,
          though later quires of six sheets were common. The division of
          the page into columns was at first retained, two being the usual
          number (e.g., Cod. Alex.); but in many manuscripts (e.g., Cod.
          Ephraemi) the lines ran across the page. [Exceptionally, ' has
          four columns, B three.] From the seventh and eighth centuries
          the present accents were more or less used, but very arbitrarily
          and irregularly. The uncials gradually changed their earlier
          simple round or square forms, and from the tenth century yielded
          to the cursives. The earliest punctuation was by means of a
          blank space and a simple point. Euthalius, a deacon in
          Alexandria, in the year 458 published an edition of the Epistles
          of Paul, and soon after of the Acts and Catholic Epistles,
          written stichometrically, i.e., in single lines containing only
          so many words as could be read, consistently with the sense, at
          a single inspiration. This mode of writing was used long before
          in copying the poetical books of the Old Testament. It involved,
          however, a great waste of parchment, so that, in manuscripts of
          the New Testament, it was superseded after a few centuries by
          punctuation-marks.

    4. The Ammonian Sections.

          Divisions of the text were early made for various purposes. In
          the third century [168]Ammonius of Alexandria prepared a Harmony
          of the Gospels, taking the text of Matthew as the basis.
          Eusebius of Cæsarea, in the early part of the fourth century,
          availing himself of the work of Ammonius, divided the text of
          each Gospel into sections, the length of which, varying greatly
          (in John xix, 6 there are three, and in twenty four other
          instances two, in a single verse), was determined solely by
          their relation of parallelism or similarity to passages in one
          or more of the other Gospels, or by their having no parallel.
          These sections (often erroneously ascribed to Ammonius) were
          then numbered consecutively in the margin of the Gospel in black
          ink; Matthew having 355, Mark 233 (not 236), Luke 342, and John
          232. They were distributed by Eusebius into ten tables or canons
          prefixed to the Gospels, and containing the sections
          corresponding in--

          I.    Matthew, Mark, Luke, John, 71.
          II.   Matthew, Mark, Luke, 111.
          III.  Matthew, Luke, John, 22.
          IV.   Matthew, Mark, John, 26.
          V.    Matthew, Luke, 82.
          VI.   Matthew, Mark, 47.
          VII.  Matthew, John, 7.
          VIII. Luke, Mark, 14.
          IX.   Luke, John, 21.
          X.    Sections peculiar to Matthew 62, Mark 21, Luke 71, John 97.

          Under the number of each section in the margin of the several
          Gospels was written in red ink the number of the canon or table
          to which it belonged. On turning to its place in this table, the
          number of the corresponding section or sections in the other
          Gospels stands with it, so that the parallel passages may
          readily be found. For example, the first verse of Matt. iv forms
          the fifteenth Eusebian section; the number two under this refers
          to the second canon or table, where it appears that section
          fifteen in Matthew corresponds to six in Mark, and fifteen in
          Luke; i.e., to Mark i. 12, and Luke iv. 1. In some manuscripts
          the parallel sections are indicated at the bottom of the page.
          They thus correspond to our marginal references. Cf. Eusebias,
          Epist. ad Carpianum; J. Burgon, The Last Twelve Verses of S.
          Mark (London, 1871), pp. 295 sqq.

    5. Early Divisions of the Text.

          Wholly different in character and purpose from the Eusebian
          sections, and probably older, is a division of the Gospels into
          sections called titloi, also kephalaia majora (in Latin
          manuscripts, breves), found in most manuscripts from the
          Alexandrine and the Ephraem (A, C) of the fifth century onward.
          Of these sections Matthew contains 68, Mark 48, Luke 83, John
          18. The numbers by which they are designated in the margin of
          manuscripts refer to the titles describing their contents at the
          top or bottom of the page, or in a list prefixed to each Gospel,
          or often in both places. A certain portion at the beginning of
          each Gospel is not numbered; for example, the first chapter in
          Matthew corresponds with our chap. ii, 1-15, and is entitled
          peri tOn magOn, "Concerning the Magi." There is a similar
          division in the Acts and Epistles, to which Euthalius (about 458
          A.D.), though not its inventor, gave wide currency by his
          stichometric edition of these books. The Apocalypse was divided
          by Andrew, bishop of Cæasrea in Cappadocia (about 500 A.D.),
          into twenty-four logoi, or chapters, and each of these chapters
          into three kephalaia, or sections, the former number answering
          to the twenty-four elders spoken of in the book (Rev. iv, 4);
          the latter suggested by the threefold division of human nature
          into body, soul, and spirit (comp. I Thess. v, 23), as the
          author himself declares. In the Vatican manuscript (B), there is
          a division of the Gospels into much shorter chapters (Matt. 170,
          Mark 62, Luke 152, John 80), very judiciously made. This has
          been found in only one other manuscript, the Codex Zacynthius
          (E). In the Acts and Epistles the Vatican manuscript has a
          twofold division into chapters, one very ancient, the other
          later, but both different from the Euthalian. In the older
          division, the Pauline Epistles are treated as one book. (For
          further details see Tischendorf, Novum Testamentum Vaticanum,
          Leipsic, 1867, p. xxx; Scrivener, Introduction, i, London, 1894,
          pp. 56 sqq.) Other ancient divisions of the New Testament into
          chapters were more or less widely current, especially in Latin
          and Syriac manuscripts.

          The superscriptions, "Epistle of Paul," "Catholic Epistles,"
          etc., can not be earlier than the fourth century, since they
          imply a canonical collection. The subscriptions at the end of
          the Pauline Epistles in many manuscripts are generally ascribed
          to Euthalius. At least six of these are untrustworthy (I Cor.,
          Gal., I and II Thess., I Tim., Tit.). For the modern divisions
          of the Bible into chapters and verses see [169]III below.

    6. Divisions for Liturgical Reading.

          An ancient division of the text is the lessons, or lections,
          from the Gospels on the one hand, and the Acts and Epistles on
          the other, read in the public services of the Church. The
          history of these is obscure, and they varied much at different
          periods and in different regions. The lessons for the Sundays
          and chief festivals of the year seem to have been the earliest;
          next were added lessons for the Saturdays, and finally for every
          day in the week, with special commemoration of saints and
          martyrs. Euthalius marked, in the Acts, 16 of these "lessons";
          in the Catholic Epistles, 10; in the Pauline Epistles, 31; in
          all, 57. He was probably not, as many have supposed, their
          inventor. The system of lessons which ultimately prevailed in
          the Greek Church appears in our evangelistaries and lectionaries
          (more properly praxapostoli), containing the lessons from the
          Gospels and the Acts and Epistles respectively. The ordinary
          manuscripts of the Greek Testament were often adapted for church
          service by masking the beginning and end of each lesson, with a
          note in the margin of the time or occasion for reading it, and
          by prefixing to them a Synaxarion, or table of the lessons in
          their order; sometimes also a Menologion, or calendar of the
          immovable festivals and the saints' days, with their appropriate
          lessons.

    7. Early Corruption of the Text.

          Turning to the internal history of the New Testament text, it is
          evident that its original purity was early lost. The quotations
          of the latter half of the second century contain readings which
          agree with later texts, but are not apostolic. Irenæus alludes
          (Hær., V, xxx, 1) to the difference between the copies; and
          Origen, early in the third century, expressly declares that
          matters were growing worse (in Matt., xix, 19, vol. iii, p. 671,
          ed. De la Rue, Paris, 1733-59), as is proved by the quotations
          of the Fathers of the third and fourth centuries. From this time
          onward we have the manuscript text of each century, the writings
          of the Fathers, and the various Oriental and Occidental
          versions, all testifying to varieties of reading for almost
          every verse, which undoubtedly occasioned many more or less
          important departures from the sense of the original text. How
          came this? The early Church did not know anything of that
          anxious clinging to the letter which characterizes the
          scientific rigor and the piety of modern times, and therefore
          was not so bent upon preserving the exact words. Moreover, the
          first copies were made rather for private than for public use;
          copyists were careless, often wrote from dictation, and were
          liable to misunderstand. Attempted improvements of the text in
          grammar and style; proposed corrections in history and
          geography; efforts to harmonize the quotations in the New
          Testament with the Greek of the Septuagint, but especially to
          harmonize the Gospels; the writing out of abbreviations;
          incorporation of marginal notes in the text; the embellishing of
          the Gospel narratives with stories drawn from non-apostolic
          though trustworthy sources, e.g., John vii, 53 to viii, 11, and
          Mark xvi, 9 to end,--it is to these causes that we must
          attribute the very numerous "readings," or textual variations.
          It is true that the copyists were sometimes learned men; but
          their zeal in making corrections may have obscured the true text
          as much as the ignorance of the unlearned. The copier, indeed,
          came under the eye of an official reviser; but he may have
          sometimes exceeded his functions, and done more harm than good
          by his changes.

    8. Varieties of Text Produced by Early Criticism.

          Attempts were made by learned Fathers to get the original text;
          and three men of the third century--Origen, the Egyptian Bishop
          Hesychius, and the Presbyter Lucian of Antioch--deserve mention
          for their devotion to this object. The last two undertook a sort
          of recension of the New Testament (cf. Jerome, Epist. ad
          Damasum); but it is not known exactly what they did, and their
          influence was small. In regard to Origen, while he did not make
          a formal recension of the New Testament text, his critical work
          was of the highest importance. Notwithstanding these
          diversities, there were, as early as the fourth and fifth
          centuries, affinities between manuscripts prepared in the same
          district, which seem to betray certain tendencies, as is proved
          by the Fathers, the versions, and the Greek manuscripts
          themselves. Thus critics are justified in speaking of an
          Oriental and Occidental, or, more correctly, an Alexandrian or
          Egyptian, and a Latin, as also of an Asiatic or Greek, and a
          Byzantine or Constantinopolitan text. According to this theory,
          the Alexandrian was used by those Jewish Christians of the East
          who already used the Septuagint; particularly was this text
          preserved and spread by the learned Alexandrian school. The
          Latin text characterizes not only the manuscripts prepared by
          Latins, but the Greek manuscripts they used. The Asiatic
          manuscripts were used chiefly by native Greeks in Greece, or in
          the Asiatic provinces having intercourse with Greece. The
          Byzantine manuscripts belonged to the Church of that empire. The
          latter alone had a certain official uniformity, and were, in the
          latter centuries, almost the only manuscripts circulated in the
          empire. This class of manuscripts is also the only one perfectly
          represented in existing documents, and is the result of the
          gradual mixture of older recensions under the predominance of
          the Asiatic or Greek. Each of these recensions is more or less
          altered and corrupted; so that it is often more difficult to
          assign a particular reading to its proper class than to find out
          the original. Finally, the differences and relationships are by
          far most strongly marked in the Gospels, least so in the
          Apocalypse, and again are more distinct in the Pauline Epistles
          and the Acts than in the Catholic Epistles. (Cf. C. Tischendorf,
          Novum Testamentum Græce, editio academica viii, Leipsic, 1875,
          pp. xxiv sqq.)

    9. The Uncial Manuscripts.

          The number of uncial manuscripts of the New Testament, ranging
          in date from the fourth to the tenth century, is 114. This does
          not include eight psalters containing the text of the hymns in
          Luke i, 46-55, 68-79, ii, 29-32, designated by Tischendorf O
          ^a-h, nor the lectionaries, evangelistaries, and praxapostoli.
          About half of these 114 are mere fragments, containing but a few
          verses or at most a few chapters. They may be arranged as
          follows with reference to their probable date:

          Cent. IV, 2: ' with the whole New Testament; B, Gospels, Acts,
          Catholic, and Pauline Epistles (mutilated).

          Cent. V, 15: A C I^1, 2, 3 I^b Q[1] Q[2] T^ag T^woi v?[2] d?^7,
          10, 14.

          Cent. VI, 24: D[1] D[2] E[2] H[3] I^4, 7 N[1] N[a] O[2] O^b[2]
          P[1] R[1] T^bceh Z Th^cefg S Ph d?^11.

          Cent. VII, 17: F^a G[2] I^5,6 R[2] T^dimpq W^ilmn Th^ab d?^12.

          Cent. VIII, 19: B[2] E[1] L[1] S[2] T^inors W^abk Y Th^d Z Ps O
          d?^6,8.

          Cent. IX, 31: E[3] F[1,2] G[2] G^b H[2] K[1,2] L[3] M[1,2] O[1]
          P[2] T^fk V W^c-ho X^b G D Th^h L P d?^9.

          Cent. X, 6: G[1] H[1] S[1] U X v?[1].

          Of these only one, ', has the New Testament entire, and only
          four others, ABC^Ps, the greater part of it. The remainder are
          distributed, according to the principal divisions of the New
          Testament, as follows:

          Gospels, 81: Complete or nearly so, 12: D E K L M S U V G D P O;
          containing considerable portions, 14: F G H N P Q R X Z L X S Ph
          v; containing at most a few chapters or verses, 55: F^a
          I^1.8.4.7 I^b N^a O T^a-f.h-r T^woi W^a-o X^b Th^a-h d?^6-12.

          Acts, 13: Complete or nearly so, 5: D E L P S; the rest with
          larger (H) or smaller portions (G G^b F^a I^2.5.6 v).

          Catholic Epistles, 5: Complete or nearly so, 4: K L P S, and the
          fragment v.

          Pauline Epistles, 20: Complete or nearly so, 7: D E F G K L P;
          containing larger or smaller fragments, 13: F^a H I^b M N O O^b
          Q R S T^gs d?^14.

          Apocalypse: besides ' A C, B[2] contains the complete text; P
          has some small gaps.

          In reference to the character of their text, Tischendorf
          classifies the uncials as follows: in the Gospels the oldest
          form of the text, predominantly Alexandrine in its coloring, is
          found, though with many differences, in ' A B C D I I^b L P Q R
          T^abc X Z D Th^cg X; next to these stand F^a N O W^abc Y
          Th^abef. A later form of the text, in which the Asiatic coloring
          prevails, is presented by E F G H K M S U V G L P Th^h, among
          which E K M G L P Th^h, incline most toward the first class. For
          the Acts and Catholic Epistles, ' A B C give the oldest text, to
          which, in the Acts, D I approach, and, less closely, E G; also,
          in the Catholic Epistles (except I Pet.), P; while in the Acts,
          H L P, and, in the Catholic Epistles, K L, come nearest to the
          later form of the text. In the Pauline Epistles the oldest text
          is represented by ' A B C H I O Q, with the Greco-Latin
          manuscripts D F G; M P approach this; while K L N stand nearest
          to the more recent text. The text of the Apocalypse appears in
          its oldest form in ' A C, to which P comes nearer than B (cf.
          Gregory, Prolegomena, pp. 185 sqq.). Tregelles exhibits the
          "genealogy of the text" and affinities of the manuscripts in the
          Gospels in the following form:

          Western Alexandrine Byzantine
                  B ' Z
          D
                  C L X 1.33
                  P Q T R I N A
                  X D 69      K M P
                              E F G S U, etc.

          Westcott and Hort attach a superlative value to B, Tischendorf
          to '. The same manuscript may differ in character in different
          parts of the New Testament: thus, A is not so excellent in the
          Gospels as elsewhere; D is especially good in the Gospel of
          Mark; ' and D agree most closely in the Gospel of John; the
          cursive 1 is remarkably valuable in the Gospels, but not so in
          the rest of the New Testament.

          The following is a complete list of the 114 uncial manuscripts:

          ': Codex Sinaitiens, found by Tischendorf (1844 and 1859) in the
          Convent of St. Catherine at the foot of Mount Sinai, now
          preserved in St. Petersburg. Forty-three leaves of the Old
          Testament portion of the manuscript, known as the Codex
          Friderico-Augustanus, are in the library of Leipsic University.
          Besides twenty-six books of the Old Testament, of which five
          form the Codex Friderico-Augustanus, the manuscript contains the
          entire New Testament without the least break, the Epistle of
          Barnabas, and the first third of the Shepherd of Hermas. The
          Alexandrian copyist has frequently shown his imperfect knowledge
          of Greek, and his haste. The license in handling the text,
          common in the first three centuries, is greater than in B A C,
          though much lees than in D. Nevertheless, the superiority of the
          Codex Sinaiticus to all other New Testament manuscripts, with
          the single exception of B, is fully proved by the numerous
          places in which its reading has the support of the oldest
          quotations or the most ancient versions. The text is in four
          columns, which is a unique arrangement. The Pauline Epistles,
          among which is Hebrews after II Thessalonians, come directly
          after the Gospels; the Acts and the Catholic Epistles, then the
          Apocalypse, follow. The date of the codex is the fourth century.
          It has a special value from the fact that, owing to the
          corrections it received in the sixth and seventh centuries and
          later, its pages represent, after a fashion, the history of the
          changes in the New Testament text. The codex was published
          (1862) in facsimile type from the Leipsic press, in four folio
          volumes, at the expense of the emperor of Russia, Alexander II.
          The edition was limited to three hundred copies. The New
          Testament part was published separately in a critical edition by
          Tischendorf, Novum Testamentum Sinaiticum cum epistola Barnabæ
          et fragmentis Pastoris etc., Leipsic, 1863, and in a more
          popular form, Novum Testamentum Græce ex Sinaitico codice omnium
          antiquissimo, Leipsic, 1865 (cf. C. Tischendorf, Die Sinaibibel,
          Ihre Entdeckung, Herausgabe, und Erwerbung, Leipsic, 1871; C. R.
          Gregory, Prolegomena, pp. 16-17; F. H. A. Scrivener, A Full
          Collation of the Codex Sinaiticus, Cambridge 1867).

          A: Codex Alexandrinus, now in the British Museum, presented in
          1628 by Cyril Lucar, patriarch of Constantinople, to Charles I.
          The New Testament begins with Matt. xxv, 8; and contains the
          whole except John vi, 50-viii, 52, and II Cor. iv, 13-xii, 6,
          with the First Epistle of Clement and part of the second. It was
          printed in facsimile by C. G. Woide, London, 1786, in ordinary
          type by B. H. Cowper, ib. 1860, who corrected some mistakes of
          Woide, and in photographic facsimile by the trustees of the
          British Museum, ed. E. M. Thompson (4 vols., London, 1879-83).
          Tischendorf places it about the middle of the fifth century;
          Scrivener at the end of the fourth or very little later.

          B[1]: Codex Vaticanus, no. 1209, in the Vatican Library. The
          manuscript contains, besides the Old Testament, the entire New
          Testament, with the exception of Heb. ix. 14 to end and II
          Timothy, Titus, Philemon, and Revelation. Juan Sepulveda,
          writing to Erasmus about 1533, mentions it. The first collation
          of the manuscript, made in 1669, by Bartolocci, then librarian
          of the Vatican, exists only in manuscript in the Paris library.
          Another was made by Birch, 1788-1801. The collation made for R.
          Bentley by an Italian named Mico was published by Ford, 1790. J.
          L. Hug wrote a learned Commentatio de antiquitate codicis
          vaticani (Freiburg, 1810). The manuscript was then in Paris, but
          it was later restored to Rome, when it became practically
          inaccessible. An inaccurate and critically worthless edition of
          the whole manuscript was issued by Cardinal Mai (5 vols., Rome,
          1828-38). C. Vercellone, J. Cozza, and G. Sergio published an
          edition of the entire codes in 6 vols. (New Testament is vol. v)
          in Rome, 1868-81, and a photographic reproduction was published
          by the Vatican (1889). The age of the manuscript is about the
          same as that of the Sinaitic, and possibly corrections are by
          the same first hand in both; and in the Vatican by a second hand
          contemporary with the first.

          B[2]: Codex Vaticanus 2066 (eighth century), formerly Basilian
          Codex 105, contains Revelation, was first imperfectly edited by
          Tischendorf in Monumenta sacra inedita (Leipsic, 1846), and more
          completely in Appendix Novi Testamenti vaticani ib. 1869). By
          Tregelles the manuscript was designated Q.

          C: Codex Ephrasmi (fifth century), now no. 9 in the National
          Library at Paris; its text was altered in the sixth century and
          again in the ninth. In the twelfth century the original writing
          was washed off to make room for the Greek text of several
          ascetic works of Ephraem Syrus (d. 373). Pierre Allix, at about
          the close of the seventeenth century, noticed the traces of the
          old writing under the later characters. Wetstein in 1716
          collated the New Testament part so far as it was legible. In
          1834 and 1835 the librarian Carl Hase revived the original
          writing by the application of the Giobertine tincture (prussiate
          of potash). Tischendorf, after great labor, brought out in 1843
          an edition of the New Testament part of the manuscript, and in
          1845, of the Old Testament fragments, representing the
          manuscript line for line, in facsimile. The codes contains
          portions of the Old Testament on sixty-four leaves, and
          five-eighths of the New Testament.

          D[1]: Codex Bezæ (about 550 A.D.), from the monastery of St.
          Irenæus in Lyons, now in the University Library at Cambridge, a
          present in 1581 from Theodore Beza. It contains, with few
          lacunæ, the Greek and Latin text of the Gospels and Acts and III
          John 11-15, stichometrically written, perhaps in Gaul. Edited by
          Kipling in 1793, but in a far better manner by Scrivener (Besæ
          Codex Cantabrigiensis) in 1864. No known manuscript has so many
          and so remarkable interpolations. Much study has been given to
          it, e.g., J. R. Harris, Codex Bezæ (Cambridge, 1891).

          D[2]: Codex Claromontanus of the Pauline Epistles, including
          Hebrews (second half of sixth century). Beza found it in the
          Monastery of Clermont, hence the name; now in the Paris Library.
          Contains the Greek and Latin text written stichometrically. It
          was retouched at different times, and exhibits especially two
          periods of the text. The Latin text represents the oldest
          version,--that of the second century. It was collated by
          Tregelles in 1849 and 1850, and edited by Tischendorf in 1852 in
          facsimile.

          E[1]: Codex Basiliensis A. N. III, 12 (750 A.D.), in Basel, a
          nearly complete manuscript of the four Gospels, collated by
          Tregelles (1848), also by Tischendorf and J. C. Müller (1843).

          E[2]: Codex Laudianus (end of sixth century), in the Bodleian
          Library at Oxford, a present from Archbishop Laud in 1636; was
          brought to England in 668; Bede (d. 735) used it when writing
          his Expositio retractata of the Acts. It contains an almost
          complete Greco-Latin text of the Acts; edited in 1715 by Hearne,
          and in 1870 by Tischendorf in Monumenta sacra inedita, novu
          collectio, vol. ix.

          E[3]: Codex Sangermanensis, a Greco-Latin manuscript of the
          Pauline Epistles (end of ninth century), now in St. Petersburg,
          the Greek text being a clumsy copy of the Codex Claromontanus.
          Of no critical value except for the Latin text. Sabatier
          published it in the third part of his Bibliorum sacrorum Latina
          versio (1749).

          F[1]: Codex Boreeli (ninth century), now in Utrecht University,
          contains the four Gospels, but with many lacunæ. Full
          description is given in J. Heringa, Disputatio de codice
          Boreeliano, ed. H. E. Vinke (Utrecht, 1843).

          F[2]: Codex Augiensis (ninth century), contains Pauline Epistles
          in Greek and Latin, Hebrews only in Latin, and the Latin is not
          an exact translation of the Greek. Richard Bentley, bought it at
          Heidelberg and his nephew presented it to Trinity College,
          Cambridge. It was collated by Tischendorf (1842), Tregelles
          (1845), and edited by Scrivener (1859).

          F^a: Designates those passages from the Gospels, Acts, and
          Pauline Epistles written on the margin of the Coislin Octateuch
          in Paris early in the seventh century. It was edited by
          Tischendorf in Monumenta sacra inedita (1846).

          G[1]: Codex Harleianus (tenth century), contains the Gospels,
          defective, now in the British Museum, brought by A. Seidel from
          the East in the seventeenth century. It was collated by J. C.

          Tischendorf from Smyrna.

          S: Codex Rossanensis (sixth century), containing Matt. i, 1-Mark
          xvi, 14 and belonging to the chapter of the Cathedral Church at

          with the three first lines in both columns at the beginning of
          each Gospel in gold. It is adorned with eighteen remarkable
          pictures in watercolors, representing scenes is the Gospel
          history, with forty figures of the prophets of the Old
          Testament. Its miniatures bear a striking resemblance to those
          of the celebrated Vienna purple manuscript of Genesis. It
          numbers a hundred and eighty-eight leaves, some of which have
          been much injured by dampness. It originally contained the four
          Gospels. The text, as well as the writing, resembles that of
          Codex N[1] of the Gospels. It was discovered in the spring of
          1879, at Rossano in Calabria (Southern Italy), by Dr. Gebherdt
          of Göttingen and Professor Harnack of Giessen, who have

          writing and outline sketches of the miniatures, is an elegant
          quarto entitled Evangeliorum codex Græcus Purpureus Rossanensis
          (Leipsic, 1880). The illuminations are reproduced in exact
          facsimile by Antonio Munoz (Rome, 1907). The text seems to hold
          a position about midway between that of the older uncials and
          those of the ninth and tenth centuries, agreeing most remarkably
          with N[1], often with A D P, or with D and the Old Latin,
          against the mass of later manuscripts.

          Ph: Codex Beratinus (probably sixth century), containing Matt.
          vi, 3-Mark xiv, 62, with some lacunæ, on purple vellum and in

          the four Gospels, is in the Monastery of St. Dionyeius on Mt.
          Athos, was examined by Gregory id 1886.

          v?[1]: Codex Athous Andreæ (ninth or tenth century), containing
          the four Gospels but with lacunæ, is in the Monastery of St.
          Andrew on Mt. Athos, was examined by Gregory in 1886.

          v?[2]: Codex Patiriensis (fifth century), twenty-one palimpsest
          leaves containing fragments of Acts and of the Catholic and the
          Pauline Epistles, now in the Vatican Library, was described by
          Batiffol (1891), partly read by W. Sanday (1895).

    10. The Cursive Manuscripts, Evangelistaries, etc.

          Besides the uncials, there are known for the Gospels over 1,200
          cursives designated by Arabic numerals, over 950 evangelistaries
          of which about 100 are in uncial writing, varying in date from
          the tenth to the twelfth century. For the Acts and the Catholic
          Epistles there are over 400 cursives, for the Pauline Epistles
          about 500, and for the Apocalypse 180. Of lectionaries there are
          known over 260, only a very few of which antedate the tenth
          century. The following are noteworthy, either because of the
          value of their readings or for the influence they have had on
          the text:

          1 Gospels, Acts, Catholic and Pauline Epistles: Codex
          Basiliensis (tenth or twelfth century), especially valuable for
          the text of the Gospels, contains the apparatus of Euthalius on
          the Acts and Epistles. Kindred to it in the Gospels are 209,
          118, 131.

          1 Apocalypse: Codex Reuchlini (twelfth century), used by Erasmus
          (1516), in the University Library at Basel.

          13 Gospels: Codex Parisiensis (thirteenth century), has some
          lacunæ, was collated by Wetstein, Griesbach, and W. H. Ferrar,
          and is closely related to 69, 124, and 346, while 543, 788, and
          826 belong to the same group.

          13 Acts and Catholic Epistles, 17 Pauline Epistles, and 33
          Gospels are all parts of the same manuscript (ninth, tenth, or
          eleventh century), and the text agrees often with that of the
          best uncials; collated by Griesbach, and Tregelles (1850).

          14 Apocalypse, 31 Acts and Catholic Epistles, 37 Pauline
          Epistles and 69 Gospels are parts of the same manuscript
          (Leicester Codex, fourteenth or fifteenth century), collated by
          Tregelles, Scrivener, and Abbott (cf. 13 supra).

          34 Acts and Catholic Epistles, 40 Pauline Epistles, 81 Gospels,
          and 92 Apocalypse are parts of the same manuscript (Codex
          Montfortianus, sixteenth century), at Trinity College, Dublin,
          collated by O. T. Dobbin (1854).

          47 Pauline Epistles (eleventh or twelfth century), in the
          Bodleian Library, collated by Tregelles.

          95 Apocalypse (Codex Parham, eleventh or twelfth century),
          belongs among the best witnesses to Revelation, collated by
          Scrivener.

          565 Gospels (ninth or tenth century) in letters of gold on
          purple parchment, with especially ancient readings in Mark;
          designated 81 by Westcott and Hort, now in St. Petersburg.

  2. History of the Printed Text.

    1. Complutensian and Erasmian Editions.

          For more than half a century after the invention of printing,
          the original text of the New Testament remained unpublished. The
          credit of first printing it belongs to Cardinal Ximenes de
          Cisneros, archbishop of Toledo, who made it vol. v of his
          Polyglot Bible (see [173]Bibles, Polyglot, I). The manuscripts
          depended upon were comparatively modern and of inferior value.
          Though the volume is dated June 10, 1514, the New Testament was
          not published before 1521 or 1522, and thus was preceded by the
          Greco-Latin New Testament of 1516, published by Froben of Basel,
          and edited by Erasmus, who used as the basis of his text, in the
          Gospels, an inferior Basel manuscript of the fifteenth century
          (cod. 2), and one of the thirteenth or fourteenth century in the
          Acts and Epistles (cod. 2). With these he collated more or less
          carefully one more manuscript of the Gospels (cod. 1), two in
          the Acts and Catholic Epistles (codd. 1 and 4), and three in the
          Pauline Epistles (codd. 1, 4, 7). The oldest of these (cod. 1,
          tenth century) has a good text in the Gospels; but Erasmus made
          very little use of it; the others are comparatively modern, and
          poor. For the Apocalypse he had only a single manuscript of the
          twelfth century, wanting the last six verses, which he
          translated into Greek from the Latin Vulgate. In various other
          places in the Apocalypse he followed the readings of the Vulgate
          in opposition to the Greek, as he did in a few cases elsewhere.
          The first edition of Erasmus was sped through the press with
          headlong haste (præcipitatum fuit verius quam editum, as Erasmus
          himself says) in order that the publisher, Froben, might get the
          start of the Complutensian. It consequently swarms with errors.
          A more correct edition was issued in 1519: Mill observed about
          four hundred changes in the text. For this and later editions,
          one additional manuscript (cod. 3) was used in the Gospels,
          Acts, and Epistles. In the third edition (1522) the changes were
          much fewer; but it is noted for the introduction of I John v, 7,
          from the Codex Montfortianus (sixteenth century). In the fourth
          edition (1527) the text was altered and improved in many places,
          particularly in Revelation, from the Complutensian Polyglot.
          That of the fifth (1535) and last (Erasmus died in 1536) hardly
          differs from the fourth.

    2. Editions of Stephens and Beza.

          The next editions which call for notice are those of the great
          printer and scholar Robert Stephens (Estienne, Stephanus; see
          [174]Stephens), three published at Paris (1546, 1549, and 1550;
          the first two, in small 12mo, are known as the O mirificam
          editions, from the opening words of the preface, which is the
          same in both; the last, a magnificent folio, is called the
          editio regia), and one at Geneva (16mo, 1551), in which the
          present division into verses was first introduced into the Greek
          text (see below, [175]III, § 3). The edition of 1550,
          notwithstanding its various readings in the margin from fifteen
          manuscripts and the Complutensian Polyglot, is mainly founded on
          the fourth or fifth edition of Erasmus. Scrivener has noted a
          hundred and nineteen places in which it differs from all of the
          manuscripts used. The text of the edition of 1551 varies but
          slightly from that of 1550. The four folio editions of Theodore
          Beza (Geneva, 1565, 1582, 1588 or 1589, and 1598), as well as
          his five 8vo editions (1565, 1567, 1580, 1590, 1604) follow, for
          the most part, Stephens's editions of 1550 or 1551, with changes
          here and there, many of which are not improvements. Stephens's
          edition of 1551 is commonly spoken of in England as the textus
          receptus; but on the Continent the first Elzevir edition,
          printed at Leyden in 1624, has generally received that
          designation. The expression is borrowed from the preface to the
          second Elzevir edition (1633), in which occur the words, Textum
          ergo habes, nunc ab omnibus receptum. The text of the seven
          Elzevir editions (1624, 1633, 1641, Leyden; 1656, 1662, 1670,
          1678, Amsterdam), among which there are a few slight
          differences, is made up almost wholly from Beza's smaller
          editions of 1565 and 1580; its editor is unknown. The textus
          receptus, slavishly followed, with slight diversities, in
          hundreds of editions, and substantially represented in all the
          principal modern Protestant translations prior to the nineteenth
          century, thus resolves itself essentially into that of the last
          edition of Erasmus, framed from a few modern and inferior
          manuscripts and the Complutensian Polyglot, in the infancy of
          Biblical criticism. In more than twenty places its reading is
          supported by the authority of no known Greek manuscript.

    3. Editions between 1657 and 1830.

          The editions from 1657 to 1830, with the exception of that of
          Griesbach (see below, [176]§ 3), are important, as regards the
          text, mainly for their accumulation of critical materials. In
          Walton's Polyglot (London, 1657; see [177]Bibles, Polyglot, IV),
          Stephens's Greek text of 1550 was accompanied by the Vulgate,
          Peshito-Syriac, Ethiopic, Arabic, and, in parts of the New
          Testament, other ancient versions, with a critical apparatus
          including the readings of Codd. A, D[1], D[2], Stephens's
          margin, and eleven cursive manuscripts collated by or for
          Archbishop Ussher. In Bishop Fell's edition (Oxford, 1675),
          which reproduces substantially the Elzevir text, other
          authorities, including readings of the Coptic and Gothic
          versions, are given in the notes, though the title page (ex plus
          100 MSS. codicibus), is very misleading. The edition of John
          Mill (Oxford, 1707, fol.; improved and enlarged by Ludolph
          Kuster, Amsterdam, Leipsic, and Rotterdam, 1710), the work of
          thirty years, marks an epoch in the history of textual criticism
          by its vast additions to the store of critical material through
          the collation of the new manuscripts, the collection of readings
          from the ancient versions, and especially from the quotations
          found in the writings of the Christian Fathers, and by its very
          learned and valuable prolegomena. Mill gave his judgment on many
          readings in his notes and prolegomena, but did not venture to
          form a text of his own, reprinting Stephens's text of 1550
          without intentional variation. The projected edition of the
          Greek Testament and Latin Vulgate in parallel columns, by the
          illustrious critic [178]Richard Bentley deserves a brief notice.
          Proposals for printing were issued in 1720, and a large amount
          of materials was collected at great expense, including a
          collation of cod. B (published by Ford in 1799); but the work
          was never completed. It was to have been founded on the oldest
          Greek and Latin manuscripts compared with the principal ancient
          versions and the quotations in the Fathers of the first five
          centuries. (Cf. A. A. Ellis, Bentleii critica sacra, Cambridge,
          1862; R. C. Jebb, Bentley, London, 1882.) The edition of
          [179]Johann Albrecht Bengel (Tübingen, 1734, 4to), while it had
          the advantage of some new manuscripts, was specially valuable
          for its discussions and illustrations of the principles of
          criticism, and its classification of manuscripts; but, except in
          the Apocalypse, Bengel did not venture to introduce any reading,
          even though he believed it unquestionably genuine, which had not
          previously appeared in some printed edition. His judgment of the
          value of different readings was, however, given in the margin
          (cf. E. Nestle, Bengel als Gelehrter, Tübingen, 1893, pp. 39
          sqq.). The magnificent edition of [180]Johann Jakob Wetstein (2
          vols. fol., Amsterdam, 1751-52), the work of forty years,
          greatly enlarged the store of critical material by extensive
          collation of manuscripts and researches into the quotations of
          the Fathers, and by his description of this material in very
          valuable and copious prolegomena (reprinted, with additions by
          Semler, Halle, 1764). He gives also the readings of the chief
          printed editions which preceded him, and describes them fully.
          He introduced the present method of denoting the uncial
          manuscripts by Roman capitals, and the cursives and lectionaries
          by Arabic figures. Besides the critical matter, Wetstein's
          edition is a thesaurus of quotations from Greek, Latin, and
          Rabbinical authors, illustrating the phraseology of the New
          Testament, or containing passages more or less parallel in
          sentiment. His publisher insisted on his reprinting the textus
          receptus (substantially that of the Elzevirs); but he gives his
          critical judgment in the margin and the notes. Other editions to
          be briefly mentioned are those of F. C. Alter (Vienna, 1786-87),
          giving the readings of twenty-two Vienna manuscripts and of four
          manuscripts of the Slavonic version; of Andrew Birch (Quatuor
          Evangelia Græce, Copenhagen, 1788, 4to, and Variæ lectiones,
          1798, 1800, 1801), exhibiting the readings of many manuscripts
          collated in the libraries of Italy, Spain, and Germany, by
          himself and others; and of C. F. Matthæi (Novum Testamentum
          Græce et Latine [the Vulgate], 12 vols., 8vo, Riga, 1782-88;
          also Novum Testamentum Græce, 3 vols., 8vo, Wittenberg, etc.,
          1803-07), for which over a hundred manuscripts were used, mostly
          from the library of the Holy Synod at Moscow. Matthæi was a
          careful collator, but a very poor critic; and his manuscripts
          generally were of inferior quality.

    4. Griesbach and his Followers.

          The first edition of [181]Johann Jacob Griesbach was published
          in 1774-75 (the first three Gospels in synopsis); but it was
          only in the second edition (2 vols., 8vo, Halle, 1796-1806) that
          be first made really good use of the materials gathered by his
          predecessors, and augmented by his own collections. A manual
          edition was issued at Leipsic in 1805, the text of which,
          differing somewhat from that of the larger edition, expresses
          his later critical judgment. Following in the track of Bengel
          and Semler, Griesbach sought to simplify the process of
          criticism by classifying his manuscripts and other authorities.
          He made three classes or recensions--the Alexandrian, the
          Western, and the Constantinopolitan or Byzantine--to the latter
          of which the mass of later and inferior manuscripts belongs.
          Though his system is not now accepted in its details, much truth
          lay at the bottom of it. His principles of criticism were sound;
          and in his application of them he displayed rare tact and skill.
          In 1827 a third edition of the first volume of his Greek
          Testament was published, with important additions, under the
          editorship of Dr. David Schulz. Griesbach's Symbolæ criticæ
          (Halle, 1785-93), and Commentarius criticus on Matthew and Mark,
          parts i, ii, with Meletemata critica prefixed to part ii, Jena,
          1798, 1811, are still valuable. A number of manual editions
          founded on that of Griesbach, but inclining more to the textus
          receptus, as those of H. A. Schott (Leipsic, 1805,1813,
          1825,1839), with a good Latin translation; G. C. Knapp (Halle,
          1797, 1813, 1824, 1829, 1840), with a useful Commentatio
          isagogica, or introduction, and carefully punctuated and
          divided; J. A. H. Tittmann (ster., Leipsic, 1820, 1828, 16mo;
          1824, 1831, 8vo); A. Hahn (Leipsic, 1840, 1841, revised ed.
          1861; reprinted at New York, 1842, by Edward Robinson); K. G. W.
          Theile (ster., Leipsic, 1844, 11th ed. 1875, by O. von
          Gebhardt), with the variations of the chief modern editors,
          parallel passages, etc.; also S. T. Bloomfield's Greek Testament
          with English Notes (London, 1832, 9th ed., 1855, 2 vols., 8vo),
          mark no progress in criticism beyond Griesbach, but rather a
          retrograde movement. The same is true of the large edition of
          the Catholic scholar J. M. A. Scholz (2 vols., 4to, Leipsic,
          1830-1836), whose extensive travels and researches in libraries
          enabled him to add a very large number of new manuscripts
          (according to Scrivener, 616) to the list of those previously
          known. But of these only thirteen were collated entire; a few
          others in the greater part; many in only a few chapters; many
          more simply inspected, or only enrolled in the list. Scholz was
          a poor critic, and as an editor and collator incredibly
          careless. He divided his manuscripts into two classes or
          recensions--the Alexandrian and the Constantinopolitan, giving
          the preference to the latter. But in applying his system, he was
          happily inconsistent, particularly in his second volume, and at
          a later period of his life (1845) abandoned it. His edition met
          with no favor from intelligent scholars; but in England, where
          Biblical criticism was at its lowest ebb, it was welcomed and
          praised by many, and its text reprinted.

    5. Lachmann.

          A new period in the history of textual criticism was inaugurated
          by the appearance (Berlin 1831) of a small edition of the Greek
          Testament by the distinguished classical scholar [182]Carl
          Lachmann, followed by a larger edition, in which the authorities
          for the Greek text were supplied by Philipp Buttmann, with the
          Latin Vulgate in the lower margin, critically edited from codd.
          Fuldensis, Amiatinus, and other manuscripts (2 vols., 8vo,
          Berlin, 1842-50). Lachmann's aim in these editions was not to
          reproduce the original text according to his best judgment (for
          this he deemed conjectural criticism to be necessary in some
          cases), but to present as far as possible on purely documentary
          evidence the text current in the Eastern churches in the fourth
          century as a basis for criticism. He paid no attention to the
          textus receptus, and used no cursive manuscripts, but founded
          his text wholly on ancient authorities; viz., codd. A B C D P Q
          T Z of the Gospels, A B C D E in the Acts and Catholic Epistles,
          A B C D G in the Pauline Epistles, and A B C in the Apocalypse,
          with the Latin Vulgate, and codd. a (Vercellensis, fourth
          century), b (Veronensis, fifth century), and c (Colbertinus,
          eleventh century) of the Old Latin, for the Gospels, besides the
          Latin versions of the Greco-Latin manuscripts in the above list;
          of the Fathers he used Irenæus, Cyprian, Hilary of Poitiers,
          Lucifer of Cagliari, and, in the Apocalypse, Primasius. His
          attempted task was not fully accomplished, partly because the
          text of some of the most important manuscripts which he used (B
          C P Q, and the Latin Codex Amiatinus) had been but very
          imperfectly collated or edited, partly because the range of his
          authorities was too narrow, and partly because he was sometimes,
          apparently at least, inconsistent in the application of his
          principles. But he was the first to found a test wholly on
          ancient evidence (Griesbach disregarded what he deemed
          unimportant variations from the received text); and his
          editions, to which his eminent reputation as a critic gave wide
          currency especially in Germany, did much toward breaking down
          the superstitious reverence for the textus receptus which had
          long prevailed.

    6. Tischendorf.

          Next to be noted are the editions of Tischendorf and Tregelles.
          Through their combined labors we have a solid basis for a
          completely critical edition of the Greek Testament in the
          accurate knowledge, not possessed before, of all manuscripts of
          the oldest class (not including lectionaries), comprising many
          newly discovered, among them the Sinaitic of the fourth century.
          [183]Lobegott Friedrich Constantin Tischendorf spent about eight
          years of his life in travels in search of manuscripts (for which
          he visited the East three times--in 1844, 1853, and 1859), or in
          collating with extreme care or transcribing and preparing for
          publication the most important of those in the various libraries
          of Europe which were before known, but had not been published or
          thoroughly examined. The following uncial Greek manuscripts (see
          the list above) were discovered by Tischendorf: ' G[2] I N[2]
          O[2] T^b.d G Th^a-d L P; first used by him: F^a I^b N[1] O^b-f
          O^b[2] P[2] Q[2] R[1.2] T^a.c W^b-e Th^e-h; published: ' B[1.2]
          C D[2] E[2] F^a I I^b L[1] M[2] N[1] O^a P[1.2] Q[1] R[1] W^a.c
          Y Th^a; (cf. C. R. Gregory's Prolegomena to Tischendorf's Novum
          Testamentum Græce, ed. viii, i, Leipsic, 1884, p. 31). His
          editions of the texts of Biblical manuscripts (including some of
          the Septuagint) comprise no less than seventeen large quarto and
          five folio volumes, not including the Anecdota sacra et profana
          (1855, new ed. 1861), or the Notitia editionis Codicis Sinaitici
          (1860), two quarto volumes containing descriptions or collations
          of many new manuscripts; and many of his collations, or copies
          of manuscripts, remain unpublished.

          The titles of Tischendorf's various writings, most of them
          relating to Biblical criticism, fill pages 7-22 of Gregory's
          Prolegomena. His first edition of the Greek Testament (Leipsic,
          1841) was promising as a first essay, but of no special
          importance except for the refutation, in the prolegomena, of
          Scholz's theory of recensions. In the Editio Lipsiana secunda
          (1849) the critical apparatus was much enlarged, and the text
          settled on the basis of ancient authority, generally with good
          judgment. In 1859 appeared the Editio septima critica maior (2
          vols.), in which very large additions were made to the critical
          apparatus, not only from manuscripts, Greek and Latin, but from
          the quotations in the writings of the Christian Fathers, and the
          evidence was for the first time fully stated, both for and
          against the readings adopted. In the first volume, Tischendorf,
          influenced perhaps by Scrivener, showed a tendency to allow
          greater weight to the later uncials and cursives than he had
          done in his edition of 1849; but he soon found that he was on
          the wrong track; and on the whole, if orthographical changes are
          included, his edition of 1859 differs more widely from the
          textus receptus than that of 1849. Its publication was
          immediately followed by Tischendorf's third journey to the East,
          and the discovery of the great Sinaitic manuscript, together
          with the acquisition of much other new critical material. After
          the publication of the Codex Sinaiticus in 1862, in a
          magnificent edition of four volumes folio, in facsimile type,
          with twenty-one plates of actual facsimiles, at the expense of
          the Russian Government, the edition being limited to three
          hundred copies, he issued in 1863, in 4to, his Novum Testamentum
          Sinaiticum, in ordinary type, but representing the manuscript
          line for line, with full prolegomena; and his Novum Testamentum
          Græce ex Sinaitico Codice, Vaticana itemque Elzeviriana lectione
          notata, in 1865, 8vo, with a supplement of additions and
          corrections in 1870. After some other publications, particularly
          the second edition of his Synopsis evangelica in 1864, in which
          the Sinaitic manuscript was first used, he undertook his last
          great critical edition of the Greek New Testament, Novum
          Testamentum Græce, editio octava critica maior (issued in eleven
          parts, i, Leipsic, Oct., 1864, xi, at the end of 1872; collected
          into two volumes, 8vo, 1869-72). This edition far surpassed all
          that had preceded it in the richness of its critical apparatus,
          and, as compared with that of 1859, rests much more on the
          authority of the oldest manuscripts, particularly the Sinaitic.
          The preparation of the prolegomena by Tischendorf himself was
          prevented by his sudden illness and subsequent death, and was
          entrusted to an American scholar residing in Leipsic,
          [184]Caspar René Gregory, who had also the valuable assistance
          of [185]Ezra Abbot. In the interest of the work Dr. Gregory made
          special journeys through Europe and into the Orient, and was
          thus enabled to give first-hand descriptions and collations of
          many manuscripts. It was published in three parts at Leipsic,
          1884-94. Besides the works mentioned, the most important
          publications of Tischendorf pertaining to the textual criticism
          of the New Testament are: Codex Ephraemi Syri rescriptus (1843,
          4to; Old Testament part, 1845); Monumenta sacra inedita (1846,
          4to); Evangelium ineditum (1847, 4to); Codex Amiatinus (Vulgate;
          1850, new ed.1854); Codex Claromontanus (1852, 4to); Monumenta
          sacra inedita, nova collectio, vols. i-vi, ix (1855-70, 4to);
          Novum Testamentum Vaticanum and Appendix Novi Testamenti
          Vaticani (1867-69, 4to); cf. Responsa ad columnias Romanas
          (1870, 8vo), also Appendix codicum celeberrimorum, Sinaitici,
          Vaticani, Alexandrini (1867, 4to); Die Sinaibibel, ihre
          Entdeckung, Herausgabe, und Erwerbung (1871, large 8vo). His
          Novum Testamentum triglottum, Græce, Latine, Germanice (Leipsic,
          1854, 2d ed., 1865) is a convenient book, the three parts of
          which were also issued separately, and in various combinations.
          The Greek is his own text, with the variations of the textus
          receptus; the Latin, the Vulgate critically revised from the
          oldest manuscripts, with the variations of the Clementine
          edition; the German the genuine text of Luther, though in modern
          orthography. Tischendorf also issued many manual editions of the
          Greek Testament, the three latest in his lifetime being
          published in 1875 by Tauchnitz, Brockhaus (to match his edition
          of the Septuagint), and Mendelssohn (Editio academica septima),
          respectively. His large editions of 1859 and 1869-72 were issued
          with the critical apparatus greatly abridged, but giving the
          chief authorities for all the important various readings, with
          the titles Editio septima critica minor (1859) and Editio octava
          critica minor (1872-77).

    7. Tregelles.

          [186]Samuel Prideaux Tregelles ranks next to Tischendorf in the
          importance of his critical labors, and in single-hearted
          devotion to his chosen task. In 1848 he issued a Prospectus for
          a critical edition of the Greek Testament, the text of which was
          to be founded solely on the authority of the oldest Greek
          manuscripts, the ancient versions to the seventh century, and
          the citations of early writers, including Eusebius. No account
          was made of the "received text," or of the great mass of cursive
          manuscripts. Completeness and accuracy in the exhibition of the
          evidence of the witnesses used were especially aimed at. Like
          Tischendorf, Tregelles visited (in 1845-46, 1849-50, and 1862)
          the principal libraries in Europe for the purpose of collating
          manuscripts the text of which had not before been published.
          These were the uncials B[2] D[2] E[1] F[2] G[1] H[1.2] I^b K[1]
          L[2] M[1.2] R[1] U X Z G L, the cursives 1, 13, 17, 31, 37, 47,
          61, 69, and also Codex Zacynthius (X). In many cases Tregelles
          compared his collations with those of Tischendorf, and settled
          the differences by a reexamination of the manuscript. In 1861 he
          edited the Codex Zacynthius (X), republishing in an appendix the
          fragments of O. His edition of The Greek New Testament, Edited
          from Ancient Authorities, with their Various Readings in Full,
          and the Latin Version of Jerome, was issued in London in seven
          successive parts: i, Matthew, Mark, 1857; ii, Luke, John, 1861;
          iii, Acts and Catholic Epistles, 1865; iv, Romans to II
          Thessalonians (iii, 3), 1869; v, Hebrews (with II Thess. iii,
          3-18) to Philemon, 1870; vi, Revelation, 1872. Part vii,
          Prolegomena and Addenda and Corrigenda, appeared in 1879, four
          years after his death, edited by Dr. Hort and A. W. Streane.
          Though Tregelles added far less than Tischendorf to our store of
          critical material, he did more to establish correct principles
          of criticism, and his various writings had a wide and most
          beneficial influence in England. He also published, in 1854, An
          Account of the Printed Text of the Greek New Testament, with
          Remarks on its Revision upon Critical Principles, and, in 1856,
          Introduction to the Textual Criticism of the New Testament,
          forming part of vol. iv of the tenth and later editions of
          Horne's Introduction. This volume was also issued separately,
          and in the eleventh edition of Horne's Introduction (1861)
          appeared with "Additions" and a "Postscript."

    8. Westcott and Hort.

          In 1881 appeared The New Testament in the Original Greek. The
          Text Revised by Brooke Foss Westcott . . . and Fenton John
          Anthony Hort (Cambridge and London). The American edition (New
          York) has a valuable introduction by Philip Schaff, with the
          cooperation of Ezra Abbot. Dr. Schaff also prepared a compact
          manual of New Testament criticism, A Companion to the Greek
          Testament and the English Version (New York, 1883), which
          embodies the substance of this introduction, thoroughly revised.
          The teat of Westcott and Hort is accompanied by an Introduction
          and Appendix (1882) in which the authors discuss the need of
          criticism for the text of the New Testament, the methods of
          textual criticism, the application of its principles to the
          text, the nature and details of their edition, and add notes on
          select readings and orthography, with orthographical alternative
          readings, and quotations from the Old Testament. In 1895 the
          text appeared in larger form, and, in 1896, the Introduction in
          finally revised form. This edition is not accompanied with any
          critical apparatus; it rather was the object of the authors, by
          a careful study of the materials furnished by their
          predecessors, augmented somewhat, however, by their own
          researches, to trace the history of the text as far as possible;
          to distinguish its different types, and determine their
          relations and their comparative value; to investigate the
          special characteristics of the most important documents and
          groups of documents; and, finally, to apply the principles of
          criticism which result from these studies to the determination
          of the original text. Their view of the genealogical relations
          of the chief ancient texts excited strong opposition in certain
          quarters, but their work was recognized as the most important
          contribution to the scientific criticism of the New Testament
          text which had yet been made. They distinguish four principal
          types of text: the Western, characterized by a tendency to
          paraphrase or to modify the form of expression, and also to
          interpolate from parallel passages or from extraneous sources,
          represented especially by D and the Old Latin versions, also in
          part by the Curetonian Syriac; the neutral represented by B and
          largely by ', preserving best the original form; the
          Alexandrian, much purer than the Western, but betraying a
          tendency to polish the language; and the Syrian, the latest
          form, a mixed text, borrowing from all, and aiming to be easy,
          smooth, and complete. They regard B as preeminent above all
          other manuscripts for the purity of its text; the readings of '
          and B combined as generally deserving acceptance as genuine,
          their ancestries having "diverged from a point near the
          autographs"; and they attach great weight to every combination
          of B with another primary Greek manuscript, as L C T D X A Z 33,
          and, in Mark, D. Westcott and Hort (see [187]Westcott, Brooke
          Foss; [188]Hort, Fenton John Anthony) began their work in 1853.
          Their method of cooperation was first independent study, then
          comparison. The Introduction is chiefly the work of Dr. Hort,
          whose name is one of the greatest in the history of
          text-criticism. He carried into the study of the text a large
          knowledge of church history and patristic theology, and it was
          this breadth of historical knowledge which made the Introduction
          the great work it is. The genealogical theory, suggested by
          Bengel and elaborated by later scholars, was here worked into a
          truly monumental form. A thorough acquaintance with this book is
          necessary to the student if he would have a clear insight of the
          deepest tendencies in the text studies of the eighteenth and
          nineteenth centuries or an understanding of the course taken by
          text-study in the present. Conscious agreement with it or
          conscious disagreement and qualification mark all work in this
          field since 1881.

    9. Other Critics of the Text.

          Of the many other scholars whose labors have aided in the
          establishment of the text of the Greek New Testament, the
          Anglican scholar [189]Frederick Henry Ambrose Scrivener deserves
          mention especially for his editions and collation of
          manuscripts. His Plain Introduction of to the Criticism of the
          New Testament (Cambridge, 1861; 4th ed., by E. Miller, 2 vols.,
          London, 1894) is a standard work. Scrivener was an able defender
          of the later manuscripts as witnesses to the original text
          against Tischendorf, Tregelles, and Westcott and Hort. In this
          contention he had the doughty support of [190]John William
          Burgon in The Revision Revised (London, 1883). Among Americans,
          Ezra Abbot and Joseph Henry Thayer; among Hollanders, W. C. Van
          Manen, J. Cramer, and J. J. Prins; among Frenchmen, P. Batiffol,
          J. P. P. Martin, and E. Amélineau; among Italians, Angelo Mai,
          Carlo Vercellone, and J. Cozza; and among Germans, F. Blass, E.
          Nestle, B. Weiss, E. Riggenbach, and O. von Gebhardt have made
          important contributions to textual criticism.

    10. More Recent Tendencies.

          When Westcott and Hort published their text in 1881 and when, in
          1882, Hort's masterpiece on introduction followed, there was a
          disposition in some quarters to believe that New Testament
          scholarship had come somewhere near a critical textus receptus.
          The genealogical theory first broached by Bengel seemed, after a
          century and a half of toil, to have led the student into a
          definite path which would surely lead to a final goal. But
          significant changes, in feeling if not in opinion, are beginning
          to manifest themselves. Westcott and Hort mark a main epoch in
          text study. More clearly than their predecessors, they showed
          that the study of the text was inseparable from the study of
          church history. But the hypothesis which Hort so powerfully
          worked out has to some extent wrought its own undoing. The lines
          of study that it suggested have brought to light so many new
          facts and so many serious problems that the tone of certitude at
          one time in fashion has passed away. To Scrivener's description
          of Westcott and Hort's text as a splendidum peccatum few will
          assent. Yet, beyond question, the situation has materially
          changed. The "Western Text" or, to call it by a safer name, the
          "Syro-Western Text," which Westcott and Hort took to be a fairly
          well delineated fact, has become an imperious problem. The
          genealogical theory has fulfilled the chief function of a good
          working hypothesis by introducing order into chaos and pointing
          to the promising lines of attack upon the vast body of data
          awaiting the student. But genealogical certitude has declined.
          With its decline has come a growing disposition to concede to
          exegesis a certain right against the overweening authority of
          any group of manuscripts, however imposing. The good text-critic
          should also be an accomplished exegete. In Barnnard Weiss the
          two qualities are in a measure blended. Hence, at a critical
          point like Rom. v. 1, the exegete in him goes against the
          authority of A B C D E K L, Vulgate, Peshito, etc., and adopts
          echomen instead of echomen.

          Monumental work is not at present the order of the day. The
          searching investigations of the versions, the detailed and
          comprehensive study of patriotic quotations, larger and clearer
          knowledge of the mental conditions under which an entire group
          of texts are likely to have undergone perceptible, even if
          inconsiderable, changes--in a word, a vast amount of labor lies
          ahead. The doing of it will require a very considerable time.
          Meanwhile the confidence and finality of a quarter-century ago
          are to be replaced by a restrained skepticism.

  3. Principles of Textual Criticism:

    1. The Basal Rule.

          It is impossible, within the limits here allowed, to state and
          illustrate the principles of criticism applicable to the text of
          the Greek Testament. A few hints may, however, be given. The
          object, of course, is to ascertain which, among two or more
          variations of the text presented by our manuscripts or other
          authorities, is the original. No kind of evidence, external or
          internal, is to be neglected. The problem is to be solved by a
          process of reasoning upon probabilities; and what has to be
          considered, in every case, is which hypothesis will best explain
          all the phenomena. This fact is sometimes partially stated under
          the form of the rule that that reading is to be accepted as
          genuine which will best explain the origin of the other
          variations. This is an important rule; but there must be taken
          into account not merely the nature of the variations, but the
          number, independence, and character of the witnesses that
          support them. The process of criticism is not a mechanical one.
          Authorities must be weighed, not counted. One good, very early
          manuscript may be worth more than a thousand copies derived from
          a late and corrupted archetype. Again, though the presumption is
          in favor of the oldest manuscripts, mere antiquity does not
          prove the excellence of a copy.

    2. Other Canons.

          One of the essential prerequisites to intelligent criticism is a
          thorough study of the occasions of error in manuscripts. This
          involves a knowledge of paleography and of the history of
          pronunciation. The similarity of certain letters or
          abbreviations in their older forms gave occasion to errors which
          can be only thus explained; and in the corruption of the Greek
          language, vowels and diphthongs originally distinct in sound
          were pronounced alike (itacism). A study of the tendencies and
          habits of transcribers is also involved. Many manuscripts, in
          the alterations they have received from later hands, illustrate
          the manner in which the text was corrupted. Among the maxima
          resulting from such a study, in connection with the
          consideration of external testimony, are these: (1) The more
          difficult reading is to be preferred (Bengel's great rule). This
          applies to those variations which are to be ascribed to design.
          Transcribers would not intentionally substitute a harsh,
          ungrammatical, unusual, Hebraistic expression, one that caused a
          difficulty of any kind, for an easier one. (2) The shorter
          reading is to be preferred (Porson's "surest canon of
          criticism"). The tendency of scribes was almost always to add,
          rather than to omit. They did not like to have their copies
          regarded as incomplete. It was common to insert in the margin of
          manuscripts, or between the lines, glosses; or explanations of
          unusual or difficult expressions, also words or clauses which
          served to supplement the language of one Gospel from the
          parallel or similar passages in another, or to complete abridged
          quotations of the Old Testament from the fuller text of the
          Septuagint. Words accidentally omitted were also placed in the
          margin, or between the lines. A transcriber might thus easily
          mistake these glosses, or supplements, of his predecessor for
          accidental omissions and transfer them to his text. This rule
          does not apply to cases where an omission can be satisfactorily
          explained by homoeoteleuton; that is, cases where two successive
          sentences or parts of sentences have a like ending. The scribe
          copies the first of these, then his eye glances to the like
          ending of the second, and he thinks that that is what he has
          just copied, and omits unconsciously the intervening words.
          Another prerequisite to successful criticism is a careful study
          of the principal documents and groups or classes of documents,
          in connection with the history of the text, so far as it can be
          traced, in order to determine by a process of comparative
          criticism their peculiar characteristics, their weak points and
          their strong points, and the relative antiquity and value of
          their texts. This process includes the ancient versions and the
          quotations in the writings of the principal Christian Fathers.
          It can not be here detailed. Griesbach did good work in this
          direction, and it has been the special study of Westcott and
          Hort. It is thus possible to weigh the external evidence in
          particular cases with some approach to accuracy.

  4. Results of the Textual Criticism of the New Testament:

          The host of "various readings" which an examination of ancient
          manuscripts, versions, and quotations, has brought to light,
          perhaps a hundred and fifty thousand in number, alarms some
          simple-minded people. Analysis at once dispels the alarm. It is
          seen that a very large proportion of these readings, say
          nineteen-twentieths, are of no authority, no one can suppose
          them to be genuine; and nineteen-twentieths of the remainder are
          of no importance as affecting the sense. Of how much, or rather,
          of how little, importance, for the most part, the remainder are,
          can readily be seen by comparing the Revised Version of the New
          Testament (with its marginal notes) with the text of the
          Authorized Version, or by an examination of the various readings
          of the chief modern editors in Scrivener's Novum Testamentum
          textus Stephanici A.D. 1550 . . . accedunt variæ lectiones (8th
          ed., Cambridge, 1877). The great number of various readings is
          simply the result of the extraordinary richness of critical
          resources, Westcott and Hort remark, with entire truth, that "in
          the variety and fulness of the evidence on which it rests, the
          text of the New Testament stands absolutely and unapproachably
          alone among ancient prose-writings."

III. Chapter and Verse Divisions:

  1. Chapter Divisions.

          The purpose of the present division into chapters and verses was
          to facilitate reference. These divisions sometimes, but not
          generally, ignore logical and natural divisions. Common opinion
          concerning chapter divisions attributes them to [191]Cardinal
          Hugo of Saint Cher for use in his concordance to the Latin
          Vulgate (c. 1240, first printed, with modification, at Bologna,
          1479). This opinion rests on the direct testimony of Gilbert
          Genebrard (d. 1597), that "the scholastics who with Cardinal
          Hugo were authors of the concordance" made the division. Quétif
          and Echard, a century and a half later than Genebrard, ascribe
          to Hugo only the subdivision of the chapters presently to be
          mentioned. The better opinion is, that Stephen Langton,
          archbishop of Canterbury (d. 1228), made the chapter division to
          facilitate citation. Before the invention of printing it had
          already passed from Latin manuscripts to those of other tongues,
          and after the invention of printing it became general. It has
          undergone slight variations from the beginning to the present
          day. Many early printed Bibles, especially Greek Testaments,
          besides these chapters retain also the old breves or titloi
          noted in the margin (see above, [192]II, 1, § 5). The chapters
          were at first subdivided into seven portions (not paragraphs),
          marked in the margin by the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G,
          reference being made by the chapter-number and the letter under
          which the passage occurred. In the shorter Psalms, however, the
          division did not always extend to seven. In Ps. cxix it seems
          not to have been used at all. This division (except in the
          Psalms) was modified by Conrad of Halberstadt (c. 1290), who
          reduced the divisions of the shorter chapters from seven to
          four; so that the letters were always either A-G or A-D. This
          subdivision continued long after the introduction of the present
          verses, but in the seventeenth century was much modified, some
          chapters having more than four, and less than seven,
          subdivisions.

  2. Verse Divisions, Old Testament.

          The present verses differ in origin for the Old Testament, New
          Testament, and Apocrypha. In the canonical Testament they appear
          in the oldest known manuscripts (see above, [193]I, 1, § 7,
          [194]2, § 2), though they were not used for citation by the Jews
          till the fifteenth century. The earlier printed Hebrew Bibles
          marked each fifth verse only with its Hebrew numeral. Arabic
          numerals were first added for the intervening verses by Joseph
          Athias, at Amsterdam, 1661, at the suggestion of Jan Leusden.
          The first portion of the Bible printed with the Masoretic verses
          numbered was the Psalterium Quincuplex of Faber Stapulensis,
          printed at Paris by Henry Stephens in 1509. In 1528 Sanctes
          Pagninus published at Lyons a new Latin version of the whole
          Bible with the Masoretic verses marked and numbered. He also
          divided the Apocrypha and New Testament into numbered verses;
          but these were three or four times as long as the present ones.

  3. Verse Divisions, New Testament.

          The present New Testament verses were introduced by Robert
          Stephens in his Greco-Latin Testament of 1551 (see above,
          [195]II, 2, § 2). Stephens says in his preface that the division
          is made to follow the most ancient Greek and Latin copies. But
          it will be difficult, if not impossible, to find any Greek or
          Latin manuscripts whose divisions coincide very nearly with
          Stephens's verses. Doubtless he made this division with
          reference to his concordance to the Vulgate, then preparing,
          published in 1555. This Latin concordance, like former ones,
          contains references to the letters A, B, C, D, E, F, G, and also
          to the numbers of the verses of each chapter "after the Hebrew
          method" of division. This latter, the preface states, has
          special reference to an operi pulcherrimo et præclarissimo which
          he is now printing, which must mean his splendid Bible of
          1556-57, 3 vols., containing the Vulgate, Pagninus, and the
          first edition of Beza's Latin New Testament. Meanwhile, for
          present convenience, he is issuing a more modest Bible
          (Vulgate), with the verses marked and numbered. This latter was
          his Vulgate of 1555 (Geneva)--the first whole Bible divided into
          the present verses, and the first in which they were introduced
          into the Apocrypha. The text is continuous, not having the
          verses in separate paragraphs, like the New Testament of 1551,
          but separated by a ¶ and the verse-number. The verse-division
          differs in only a very few places from that of 1551; and a
          comparison shows that the concordance agrees rather with the
          division of 1551 than with that of 1555. The statement so often
          made that the division was made "on horseback" while on a
          journey from Paris to Lyons must be qualified. His son asserts
          that the work was done while on the journey, but the inference
          most natural and best supported is that the task was
          accomplished while resting at the inns along the road.

          In other languages the division appeared first as follows:
          French, New Testament, Geneva, 1552, Bible, Geneva, 1553 (both
          R. Stephens); Italian, New Testament, L. Paschale (Geneva?),
          1555; Dutch, New Testament, Gellius Ctematius (Gillis van der
          Erven), Embden, 1556, Bible, Nikolaus Biestkens van Diest,
          Embden, 1580; English, Genevan New Testament, 1557, Genevan
          Bible, 1560; German, Luther's Bible, perhaps Heidelberg, 1568,
          but certainly Frankfort, 1582.

          In Beza's editions of the Greek Testament (1565-1604) sundry
          variations were introduced, which were followed by later
          editors, notably the Elzevirs (1633, etc.); and many minor
          changes have been made, quite down to the present day.

          A very convenient and illuminating "table of ancient and modern
          divisions of the New Testament," giving the divisions in the
          Vatican manuscript, the titloi, the Ammonian kephalaia, the
          stichoi, remata, and the modern chapters and verses, is given in
          Scrivener, Introduction, i, 68. The titloi, kephalaia and tables
          of the Eusebian canons are available in such editions as
          Stephens's Greek Testament of 1550, and Mill's of 1707, 1710.
          The Greek Testament by Lloyd (Oxford, 1827) and by Mill (1859)
          give the Eusebian canons. For a synopsis of variations in
          manuscripts consult J. M. A. Scholz, Novum Testamentum Græce, i,
          Frankfort, 1830, pp. xxvii-xxix.

          The Stephanic verses have met with bitter criticism because of
          the fact that they break the text into fragments, the division
          often coming in the middle of the sentence, instead of forming
          it into convenient and logical paragraphs, an arrangement which
          has seldom found favor. But their utility for reference
          outweighs their disadvantage. They should never be printed in
          separate paragraphs (as in the English Authorized Version), but
          the text should be continuous and the numbers inserted in the
          margin (as in the Revised Version).

          Bible versions, or translations of the original Hebrew and Greek
          of the Old and New Testaments, may be treated in an encyclopedia
          from different points of view: (1) from the critical, as
          instruments with which to reconstruct the original text; (2)
          from the exegetical, as showing how the Bible was understood in
          different times and places; (3) from the historical, as
          documents for showing the extent of the Bible and of its
          propagation among the nations of the earth; (4) from a literary
          and philological standpoint, since the Bible versions are often
          the earliest monuments of the respective languages.

          Versions are either primary and direct, as the Septuagint, or
          secondary and indirect, derived versions, as the Old Latin.
          [They now exist, either for the entire Bible or a part, in more
          than five hundred languages. During 1906 eleven new versions
          were added and translation or revision is in progress in over
          one hundred tongues. Scriptures for the blind are issued by the
          British and Foreign Bible Society in fifteen languages.]
          Manifestly only a selection of the more important versions can
          be treated here.

          Of the complete Bible in the original languages there is as yet
          but one edition in existence: Biblia Sacratam Veteris quam Novi
          Testamenti cum Apocryphis secundum fontes Hebræos et Græcos, ed.
          C. B. Michaelis (2 vols., Züllichau, 1740--41; cf. the
          correspondence on this point in the Sunday School Times, Sept.
          and Oct., 1899, raised by a statement in the TLZ, 1899, no. 14).

A. Ancient Versions.

  I. Greek Versions.

    1. The Septuagint.

      1. Origin.

          The Bible version most important in every respect is the
          Alexandrian translation of the Old Testament, the so-called
          Septuagint. "Custom now holds to the version which is called the
          Septuagint," writes Augustine (De civitate Dei, xviii, 42). The
          term "Septuagint" is an abbreviation of secundum septuaginta
          interpretes; the subscription of Genesis in the Codex Vaticanus
          is "According to the Seventy"; Codex A has before Isaiah, "the
          Edition of the Seventy"; this is based on the story that King
          Ptolemy Philadelphus, by the advice of his librarian Demetrius
          Phalereus, asked from the high priest Eleazar of Jerusalem
          seventy-two scholars, who translated for him in seventy-two days
          the law, and, after a later form of the legend, in seventy-two
          (or thirty six) cells, the seventy-two or thirty-six copies
          being found without any variation when brought together and
          compared. The story is first told in the so-called "Letter of
          Aristeas" (see [196]Aristeas), who pretends to be one of the
          officers sent by Philadelphus to Jerusalem, and is wholly
          unhistorical.

          As the date of the version ancient chronicles mention the 2d,
          7th, 17th, 18th, 19th, or 20th year of Philadelphus, the year
          1734, 35, 36, or 37 of Abraham; as its day the 8th of Tebeth, a
          day of darkness like that on which the golden calf was made (cf.
          Margoliouth, in the Expositor, Nov., 1900, 348-349). Philo
          relates, on the contrary, that the Jews of Alexandria kept in
          his time an annual festival "in commemoration of the time when
          the interpretation first shone out, and they praised God for his
          works in times new and old." He knows that the interpreters
          asked God's blessing on this undertaking; "for he answered their
          prayers that more and more the whole race of men might be
          assisted to correctness of life in thought and deed." This
          aspiration was fulfilled when the version became one of the
          chief instruments for the preparation and propagation of
          Christianity (on this aspect of the version cf. E. W. Grinfield,
          Apology for the Septuagint, London, 1850; W. R. Churton, The
          Influence of the Septuagint on the Progress of Christianity,
          London, 1861; A. Deissmann, Die Hellenisierung des semitischen
          Monotheismus, Leipsic, 1903). It is not yet certain whether the
          translation is due, as the legend purports, to the literary
          interest of a king who was a bibliophile; or, as is the common
          view at present, to the religious wants of the Jewish community
          of Alexandria; or to the needs of an intended Jewish propaganda.
          For the latter view the prologue of Ecclesiasticus may be
          mentioned, which is, at the same time, the first witness to
          speak of all three parts of the Hebrew Bible as already extant
          in Greek; Aristeas, Philo, and Josephus speak only of the law.
          Of the several books of the Old Testament only Esther has a
          statement about the translation of the book, which is referred
          generally to Soter II (114 B.C.), but by H. Willrich (Judaica,
          Göttingen, 1900) to Ptolemy XIV (48 B.C.). At the end of Job is
          the strange notice: "This is interpreted from the Syrian book."

      2. Printed Editions

          The first part of the Septuagint to be multiplied by the
          printing-press was the Psalms in the Greek and Latin Psalter of
          Bonacursius (Milan, Sept. 20, 1481; in Greek alone, Venice,
          1486, and again by Aldus Manutius about 1497). The complete
          editions fall into four classes according as they are derived
          from one or another of four original editions, of which the
          first (designated as c) is the Complutensian Polyglot of
          Cardinal Ximenes, printed 1514-17 but not published until 1521
          (see [197]Bibles, Polyglot, I; cf. Franz Delitzsch, Studien zur
          Entstehungsgeschichte der Polyglottenbibel des Cardinals
          Ximenes, Leipsic, 1871, supplemented 1878-86; T. H. Darlow and
          F. H. Moule, Historical Catalogue . . . of the BFBS, ii, London,
          1908, 1 sqq.). Of the manuscripts used for the Greek Old
          Testament we know with certainty Vat. Gr. 330 and 346, and
          Venet. 5 (= Holmes-Parsons 108, 248, and 68). The second (a) is
          the Aldine Bible published by Andreas Asulanus, father-in-law of
          the elder Aldus (Venice, 1518). Among the manuscripts used were
          Holmes-Parsons 29, 68, 121, all of Venice. The third and most
          important is the Editio Sixtina (b), published by Pope Sixtus V
          (Rome, 1586 [1587]) on the basis of Codex Vat. Gr. 1209 (= B[1]
          in the article [198]Bible Text, II, 1, § 9). Besides c and a,
          the manuscripts Holmes-Parsons 16, 19, 23, 51 seem to have been
          used, especially for the scholia, which were collected chiefly
          by Petrus Morinus and enlarged by Flaminius Nobilius in the
          Latin translation published 1588. The fourth edition (4 vols.
          folio and 8 vols. 8vo, Oxford, 1707-20) was begun by
          [199]Johannes Ernst Grebe, who published vols. i and iv (1707,
          1709), and after his death (1711) was completed by Francis Lee
          (vol. ii, 1719) and George Wigan (vol. iii, 1720). It is based
          on the Codex Alexandrinus (A; see [200]Bible Text, II, 1, § 9)
          with use of other sources, especially Origen's Hexapla, has
          useful prolegomena, and possesses a merit of its own.

          These editions have been often reproduced--the Sixtine edition
          most frequently-- with more or less of editorial labor (for list
          of reprints, etc.; also mention of the more important editions
          of single books of the Greek Old Testament, cf. the Hauck-Herzog
          RE, iii, 4-9and Swete, Introduction, 171-194). But no existing
          edition of the Septuagint satisfies present wants, for none
          gives an exact reproduction of the manuscript or manuscripts
          which it follows, nor does any provide a full apparatus
          criticus. The first attempt to satisfy the latter want was made
          in the great work begun by [201]Robert Holmes and completed
          after his death (1805) by James Parsons, Vetus Testamentum
          Græcum cum variis lectionibus (5 vols., Oxford, 1798-1827; cf.
          Swete, Introduction, 184-187; Church Quarterly Review, Apr.,
          1899, 102 sqq., and the annual accounts published during the
          progress of the work from 1789 to 1805). The text is that of b.
          Not less than 164 volumes of manuscript collations prepared for
          this work are still in the Bodleian Library. All manuscripts,
          versions, and quotations were put under contribution. Despite
          some drawbacks in the plan and still more in the execution, the
          work deserves admiration; it is still indispensable to all who
          wish full information about the Old Testament in Greek. The
          advance made in the course of the nineteenth century is due, on
          the one hand, to the discovery of new materials (e.g. the Codex
          Sinaiticus; see [202]Bible Text, II, 1, § 9); on the other, to
          greater exactness in handling witnesses. Both these advantages
          are evident in the work of C. Tischendorf, P. de Lagarde, and H.
          B. Swete. Tischendorf (Vetus Testamentum Græce juxta LXX
          interpretes, 2 vols., Leipsic, 1850; 7th ed., 1887) repeated the
          text of b and enriched it with variants from the Codex
          Alexandrinus, Ephraemi Rescriptus, and (after 1869) the
          Sinaiticus, adding rich prolegomena. Lagarde's work, though left
          incomplete, was monumental (for list of his publications, see
          [203]Lagarde, Paul Anton de). Swete reproduced in his edition
          (The Old Testament in Greek according to the Septuagint, 3
          vols., Cambridge, 1887-94; 2d ed., 1895-99; 3d ed., 1901-07) for
          the first time not the printed text of b, but the Vatican
          manuscript itself, in the first edition according to the
          facsimile impression of Fabiani-Cozza (Rome, 1869-81), which for
          the second has been revised (by E. Nestle) after the
          photographic reproduction. Where the manuscript is deficient the
          text has been taken from the oldest manuscript accessible in a
          trustworthy form, while under the text variants have been given
          from some of the oldest manuscripts, as Sinaiticus,
          Alexandrines, and Ambrosianus. The merit of this edition is that
          it gives the materials with greatest accuracy; its defect, that
          it does not make any attempt to construct the text according to
          the principles of textual criticism, but follows the leading
          manuscript even in its most glaring faults. And in some books at
          least (e.g. in Ecclesiasticus), the oldest manuscripts are far
          from being the best. But this deficiency is fully explained by
          the fact that the edition is intended to be but the basis of a
          great critical edition now in course of preparation, of which
          the first part has already appeared, The Old Testament in Greek,
          according to the Text, of Codex Vaticanus Supplemented from
          Other Uncial Manuscripts, with a Critical Apparatus Containing
          the Variants of the Chief Ancient Authorities for the Text of
          the Septuagint, ed. A. E. Brooke and N. McLean, vol. i, The
          Octateuch, part i, Genesis (Cambridge, 1906; cf. JTS, iii,
          601-621, and E. Nestle, Die grosse Cambridger Septuaginta, in
          Verhandlungen des XIII. Internationalen Orientalistenkongresses,
          1902; idem, Septuagintastudien, vol. v, 1907 ).

          There are two English translations: The Septuagint Version of
          the Old Testament according to the Vatican Text, translated into
          English, with the principal various readings of the Alexandrine
          copy, and a table of comparative chronology, by Sir Lancelot
          Charles Lee Brenton (2 vols., London, 1844; has also the Greek
          text); the other by Charles Thomson (Philadelphia, 1808; new
          ed., The Old Covenant, commonly called the Old Testament, by S.
          F. Pells, 2 vols., London, 1904).

      3. Early Corruption of the Text.

          That there is yet not a satisfactory edition of the Septuagint
          is not because of want of materials for its preparation--there
          is on the contrary an embarras de richesse--but of its
          complicated history. The history of a translation will always be
          more complicated than that of an original text, but in this case
          it is the more so as the Septuagint is a work of Jewish origin,
          taken over into the Christian Church. Of the pre-Christian
          period of its history next to nothing is known. There are some
          Hellenistic writers who used the Septuagint, as Demetrius,
          Eupolemus, Aristeas (the historian), Ezekiel, and Aristobulus;
          but the preserved fragments of their writings are too few and
          incomplete to establish more than the mere fact that they used
          the Septuagint. Philo made extensive use of the law, but his
          quotations from the rest of the Old Testament are very few, and
          from Ruth, Esther, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, Lamentations,
          Ezekiel, and Daniel he does not quote at all. Besides, his
          writings can be traced back only to the library of Origen, and
          have been transmitted to us probably exclusively through
          Christian copyists. For Josephus we must be content to know that
          for his description of the restoration he used what is now
          called I Esdras; but about his relation to the chief manuscripts
          there is uncertainty. Even the quotations in the New Testament
          do not justify very definite statements, except that they prove
          that already in those times the copies were not free from
          textual corruption (cf. Heb. iii, 9; xii, 5). A little later the
          situation is described by Origen-speaking, it is true, chiefly
          of the manuscripts of the New Testament, but what he says holds
          good also of those of the Old Testament: "Now it is clear that
          there has come a great difference in copies, either through the
          laziness of scribes or from the audacity of those who introduced
          corruptions as amendments, or of others who took away from or
          added to their new text such things as seemed good to them."

      4. The Hexapla of Origen.

          If the situation was already bad, since any copyist or reader
          who was acquainted with the original might change single
          passages on comparison with the Hebrew, it became worse when new
          translations appeared, especially those of Aquila, Symmachus and
          Theodotion (see below, [204]2). At last a systematic comparison
          of the Septuagint with the Hebrew and these versions was carried
          out by Origen in the Hexapla (see [205]Origen), and what
          appeared to him a safeguard against the calamity that threatened
          the text turned out--not by his fault, but through later
          ignorance and carelessness--the worst aggravation of it. In
          continuation of the passage just quoted, he goes on to say that
          through the guidance of God he found a way to correct the
          dissonance in the copies. Using the Hebrew as a criterion, and
          adopting the text of the Septuagint which confirmed the Hebrew,
          he made the two the ground text, and marked changes by
          diacritical signs. It is pardonable that he took his Hebrew
          text--whence he got it is not known--as the original text; but
          it was contrary to sound criticism to take those readings of the
          Septuagint which agreed with the Hebrew for the true ones,
          instead of those which differed from it (cf. the third axiom of
          Lagarde for the restoration of the Septuagint, Mittheilungen, i,
          21). Nevertheless we should be extremely thankful if the work of
          Origen had been preserved. Until 1896 it was known only from the
          descriptions of Eusebius, Jerome, Epiphanius, and some later
          writers, and by specimens preserved in scholia of Biblical
          manuscripts, a great part also by a literal Syriac translation
          (see below, [206]§ 6). In 1896 Giovanni Mercati discovered in a
          palimpsest of the Ambrosian Library of Milan the first
          continuous fragments of a copy of the Hexapla, and in 1900
          another and much older piece was found by C. Taylor among the
          Greek palimpsests from the Cairo genizah in the Taylor and
          Schechter collection. These fragments show that Origen put
          generally only one Hebrew word, or at the most two, in one line;
          the extent of the work, therefore, must have been much greater
          than was previously supposed. The later fate of the original is
          unknown. Jerome saw and used it in the library at Cæsarea; it
          may have been destroyed there during the invasion of the Arabs.

          Origen arranged his work in six columns, the first containing
          the Hebrew text in Hebrew letters, the second the same in a
          Greek transcription, the third the translation of Aquila, the
          fourth that of Symmachus, the fifth the Septuagint, the sixth
          the translation of Theodotion. For some books, especially the
          Psalms, Origen had a fifth, sixth, and even a seventh
          translation at his disposal (see below, [207]2, § 3). In the
          Septuagint column he used the system of diacritical marks which
          was in use with the Alexandrian critics of Homer, especially
          Aristarchus, marking with an obelus--under different forms, as
          ÷, called lemniscus, and --?, called hypolemniscus--those
          passages of the Septuagint which had nothing to correspond in
          Hebrew, and inserting, chiefly from Theodotion under an asterisk
          (*), those which were missing in the Septuagint; in both cases a
          metobelus (g) marked the end of the notation. This column was
          copied afterward with additional excerpts from the other
          versions on the margins; and, if it had been copied with all its
          critical marks, it would have been well, but later copyists
          neglected these, completely and produced what we may call
          kryptohexaplaric manuscripts, completely spoiling by this
          carelessness the value of the Septuagint for critical purposes.
          Such a copy, for instance, is, for Kings, the Codex
          Alexandrinus; and it is but a poor defense of these copyists
          that the same process has been repeated in the nineteenth
          century by the Moscow and Athens reprints of Grabe's edition of
          that codex.

      5. Lucian and Hesychius.

          After Origen, Eusebius and his friend Pamphilus were careful to
          continue or disseminate his exegetical labors. Copies of the
          Pentateuch are known which were compared with the Samaritan text
          (cf. S. Kohn, Samareitikon und Septuaginta, in Monatsschrift für
          Wissenschaft des Judenthums, new series, i, 1894, pp. 1-7,
          49-67; ZDMG, 1893, p. 650). Jerome mentions besides Eusebius and
          Pamphilus, Lucian and Hesychius, the text of the former being
          used from Constantinople to Antioch, that of the latter in
          Alexandria and Egypt, while the provinces between, especially
          Palestine, kept to the copies of Origen as published by Eusebius
          and Pamphilus (Præfatio in paralipomena; Adv. Rufinum, ii, 27).
          About neither the work nor the person of Hesychius (see
          [208]Hesychius, 1) is there complete certainty. He may have been
          the martyr bishop mentioned by Eusebius (Hist. eccl., viii, 13)
          together with Phileas of Thmuis. The result of his labors is
          sought now for the Octateuch in the manuscripts 44, 74, 76, 84,
          106, 134; for the prophets, especially Isaiah and the Twelve, in
          the Codex Marchalianus and its supporters 26, 106, 198, 306 (cf.
          N. McLean, in JTS, ii, 1901, p. 306, and A. Ceriani, De Codice
          Marchaliano, Rome, 1890, pp. 48 sqq., 105 sqq.). Lucian was a
          deacon of Antioch, who died a martyr at Nicomedia 312 (see
          [209]Lucian the Martyr). He must have known a Hebrew text which
          showed many peculiarities, especially in the historical books,
          and perhaps used for his purposes the Syriac version. The first
          part of his work has been edited by Lagarde in Librorum Veteris
          Testamenti canonicorum, pars prior, græce (Göttingen , 1883; cf.
          his Mittheilungen, ii, 171). But this revision must not be
          confounded with the original Septuagint any more than the
          English Revised with the Authorized Version. Since the fourth
          century very little has been done in the Greek Church for its
          Bible. Emperors directed beautiful copies of it to be
          written--e.g., Constantine ordered fifty copies through Eusebius
          for the new churches of his capital, and for Constans Athanasius
          procured "copies of the divine writings," one of which is
          perhaps preserved in the famous Codex Vaticanus. Other royal
          persons wrote them with their own hands.

      6. Versions Made from the Septuagint.

          Latin was probably the first language into which the Septuagint
          was translated. (On the Latin version, or rather versions, of
          the Septuagint see below, [210]II, 1. It is a pity that so
          little of these labors has been preserved, and that these few
          remnants are so difficult of access.) After the Latin versions
          came the Egyptian (see [211]VII), Here the difficulty of the
          language makes these helps for restoration of the Septuagint
          accessible to few. Similar is the case with the most neglected
          branch of the Semitic languages, the Ethiopic (see [212]VIII).
          The Arabic versions (see [213]B, I) are for a great part too
          late to have much weight for the critic of the Septuagint. The
          Gothic version (see [214]X) is an outcome of the Lucianic
          recension, for which it would have great importance, both for
          age and literalness, but very little of the Old Testament is
          preserved in Gothic. The Lucianic recension is also the basis of
          a Slavonic version (see [215]B, XVI) and through it of the
          Georgian (see [216]IX). The Armenian version (see [217]VI) is
          again of great importance, also the so-called Syro-Hexaplar
          version made in the year 616-617 by Paul, bishop of Tella
          (Constantine in Mesopotamia), in a cloister near Alexandria with
          the utmost fidelity from manuscripts which went back by few
          intervening links to the very copies of the Hexapla and Tetrapla
          of Origen. The greater is the pity, therefore, that only
          fragments have been preserved, and that especially the codex
          which André du Maes (Masius, d. 1573) had in his hands,
          containing the historical books (including part of Deuteronomy
          and Tobit), has been lost, and that only a part of this Bible
          (poetical and prophetic books) is still preserved in the
          Ambrosian Library at Milan, hence called Codex Syro-hexaplaris
          Ambrosianus (published in a photolithographic facsimile edition
          by A. Ceriani as vol. vii of the Monumenta sacra et profana,
          Milan, 1874). The fragments of Genesis, Exodus, Numbers, Joshua,
          Judges, and I and II Kings have been most carefully edited in
          the last work of Paul de Lagarde, Bibtiothecæ Syriacæ, a Paulo
          de Lagarde collectæ quæ ad philologiam sacram pertinent
          (Göttingen, 1892). For earlier works on this version cf. E.
          Nestle, Litteratura Syriaca (reprinted from his Syrische
          Grammatik, Berlin, 1888), 29-30; cf. also T. S. Rordam, Libri
          Judicum et Ruth (Copenhagen, 1859-61), and F. Field, Otium
          Norvicense, i (Oxford, 1864), and his edition of the Hexapla
          (Oxford, 1875). There are also fragments in the special dialect
          called Syro-Palestinian, on which cf. Swete, Introduction, 114,
          and F. C. Burkitt, in JTS, ii, 174 sqq.

          Up to the present day in several Churches these versions based
          on the Septuagint have been retained and even in those where
          they have been replaced by translations from the original, as in
          the Latin West through Jerome or in modern Europe through the
          Reformation, the influence of the Septuagint is still very
          marked; note, for instance, the names of the Biblical books in
          the latest of these revisions, the English Revised Version.

      7. Manuscripts.

          The versions just mentioned are one of the three sources which
          exist for the recovery of the true text of the Septuagint, the
          first class being, of course, the Greek manuscripts still in
          existence, the third the quotations of ancient writers. A list
          of the more ancient manuscripts of the Septuagint was given in
          the eighteenth century by Stroth in Eichhorn's Repertorium
          (Leipsic, 1777 sqq.), vols. v sqq.; the most complete list was
          formerly that in the prefaces of Holmes-Parsons; then in the
          prolegomena of Tischendorf and in Lagarde's Genesis Græce; but
          reference may now be made to Swete, Introduction, pp. 122-170. A
          few remarks on some of them may be offered.

          The four great uncials, ' or S, A, B, and C, are the chief
          manuscripts also for the New Testament (see [218]Bible Text, II,
          1, § 9). For ' there is needed a photographic reproduction or a
          complete new collation. The notations from A in Swete's
          Septuagint need revision, at all events in the first volume. Of
          B a new photographic reproduction is in preparation; on the
          suggestion of Rahlfs that B is dependent on Athanasius, cf. E.
          Nestle, introduction to the Textual Criticism of the Greek New
          Testament (London, 1901), 62, 181, where (note 1) read
          Constantius instead of Constans. Concerning the famous
          illuminated Codex Cottonianus (D), which was badly injured by
          fire in 1731, nothing new has come to light since Swete wrote;
          it is well to mention the name of Martin Folkes as editor, by
          whom were issued the facsimiles in the Vetusta monument of 1747.
          On the purple illuminated Genesis of Vienna (L), there is a
          dissertation by W. Lüdtke (Greifswald, 1897), who is inclined to
          ascribe this oldest Biblical history with illuminations to the
          second part of the fifth century. To the eighteen uncial
          manuscripts enumerated by Swete (Introduction, pp. 146-148) as
          not yet used for any edition of the Septuagint and remaining
          without a symbolical letter or number, may be added: fragments
          of Genesis at Vienna (cf. Philologischer Anzeiger, xiv, 1884,
          415); a Hebrew-Greek palimpsest containing fragments of Ps.
          cxliii, cxliv; and parts of four leaves from a papyrus codex of
          Genesis, of the late second or early third century (Oxyrhynchus
          papyri no. 656). On the minuscules scarcely anything has been
          done lately, except that some will be used in the Cambridge
          edition mentioned above ([219]§ 2). For facsimiles, cf. F. G.
          Kenyon, Facsimiles of Biblical Manuscripts in the British Museum
          (London, 1901).

          The question, in which set of manuscripts the purest text is to
          be found, is not yet settled. It is the more complicated since
          the Old Testament is a collection of books which in one and the
          same manuscript may have had a very different pedigree; for
          whole Bibles (pandectes, such as manuscripts ', A, and B) do not
          seem to have been produced much before the time of Eusebius or
          Origen.

    2. Later Greek Translations.

          The rupture between Church and Synagogue led to new
          translations. The authors of at least three of them are known by
          name, Aquila, Symmachus, and Theodotion.

      1. Aquila.

          Of the Fathers of the Church, Irenæus is the first who mentions
          Aquila of Pontus as a translator of the Bible. Epiphanius calls
          him a "Greek" and a relation of Hadrian, and tells that he was
          placed by Trajan in charge of the rebuilding of Jerusalem, that
          he became a Christian but returned to the Jewish faith.
          Epiphanius places his translation in the twelfth year of
          Hadrian, 430 years, four months, less nine days after the
          Septuagint. Jewish sources mention a proselyte Aquila, a
          contemporary of Rabbis Eliezer, Joshua, and Akiba, who met
          Hadrian and is called his nephew, and is praised as translator
          of the Bible in the words of Ps. xlv, "thou art fairer than the
          children of men"; some passages of his translation are quoted.

          It is not clear as yet, whether or how the dates of Epiphanius
          and the statements of the Pseudo-Clementine writings about
          Aquila, the disciple of Simon Magus, are to be combined. That
          Aquila the translator of the Bible is the well-known husband of
          Priscilla in the New Testament is a fancy of Hausdorff. His
          translation, the use of which was permitted in the synagogue by
          Justinian, is the most literal ever produced, and enough has
          been preserved to judge of its value and character. Up to 1897
          all known of it went back to the Hexapla of Origen (cf. F.
          Field, Origenis Hexaplorum quæ supersunt, 2 vols., Oxford,
          1867-75, and, on Field, J. H. Burn, Expository Times, Jan.,
          1897). In 1897 for the first time a continuous portion of his
          translation came to light in a palimpsest of the Cairo
          Synagogue, showing the tetragrammaton written in Old Hebrew
          letters. The statement of Jerome that Aquila made two versions,
          "a second edition, which the Hebrews call 'the accurate one,'"
          seems to be correct. Some new fragments to be added to Field are
          in J. B. Pitra, Analecta sacra (Paris, 1876); E. Klostermann,
          Analekta zur Septuaginta (Leipsic, 1895); Jerome, in Anecdota
          Maredsolana, iii, 1.

      2. Symmachus.

          According to Epiphanius, Symmachus was a Samaritan, and lived
          not under Severus, but under "Verus" (i.e., Marcus Aurelius; cf.
          Lagarde, Symmicta, ii, Göttingen, 1880). Geiger identified the
          translator with Symmachus ben Joseph, disciple of Rabbi Meir
          (jüdische Zeitschrift für Wissenschaft und Leben, i, 1862, pp.
          62-64). Origen got the manuscript of his translation from a
          certain Juliana of Cæsarea, who had received it with other works
          of Symmachus from Symmachus himself. Whether the Cæsarea where
          she lived was that of Palestine or Cappadocia is in doubt. In
          the sixteenth century Symmachus's works were still in existence
          at Rodosto near Constantinople (cf. R. fürster, De
          antiquitatibus et libris manuscriptis Constantinopolitanis,
          Rostock, 1877; T. Zahn, TLB, 1893, p. 43). Symmachus wrote the
          most elegant Greek of all these translators. Jerome quotes in
          three passages a second translation.

      3. Theodotion.

          Theodotion, according to Irenæus, was from Ephesus; according to
          Epiphanius, from Pontus; he went over from Gnosticism to
          Judaism. His work is a revision of the Septuagint and has
          therefore been placed by Origen in his Hexapla next to the
          column of the Septuagint. For the same reason Origen made use
          chiefly of Theodotion to supply such passages as were missing in
          the Septuagint (cf. I Sam. xvii, 12 sqq.; Jer. xxxiii, 14-26;
          xxxix, 4-13). For the Book of Daniel his version came into
          general use in the Church, while the older Greek version has
          been preserved only in the one codex (Chisianus) discovered
          1772. Readings similar to those of Theodotion are found before
          his time (on this question cf. E. König, Einleitung, ii, 108;
          TLB, 1897, 51; Stärk, ZWT, 1895, 288). Howorth offers some
          unconventional views (PSBA, 1891-92) on the question whether
          Chronicles and Ezra-Nehemiah in our editions of the Septuagint
          are from Theodotion. That his name has the same meaning as that
          of the Targumist Jonathan seems accidental.

          Besides these versions, which covered the whole Old
          Testament--note, however, that for Samuel we have no quotations
          from Aquila--Origen succeeded in finding, at least for certain
          parts, more translations; the one which he numbered five, in
          Nicopolis near Actium; the sixth with other Hebrew and Greek
          books in a clay jar near Jericho in the time of Antoninus, the
          son of Severus.

          Deserving of brief mention is a Greek translation which is 1,000
          years younger than the preceding, the (Græcus Venetus, which
          first became known in 1740 through the catalogue of the library
          of San Marco. The complete and final edition is due to O. von
          Gebhardt (Græcus Venetus, Pentateuchi, Proverbiorum, Ruth,
          Cantici, Ecclesiastæ, Threnorum, Danielis græca versio, with
          preface by F. Delitzsch, Leipsic, 1875). Delitzsch is inclined
          to see in the translation the work of a Jew, Elisseus, who lived
          at the court of Murad I in Prusa and Adrianople; von Gebhardt,
          that of a proselyte. The rendering of "Yahweh" by ontourgos,
          ousiOtes and the use of the Doric dialect for the Aramaic
          portions of Daniel are interesting.

  II. Latin Versions.

          The origin of the earliest Latin versions is unknown. This fact
          is easily explained if the case was stated correctly by
          Augustine: "Those who translated the Scriptures from Hebrew into
          Greek can be enumerated; but the Latin translators by no means.
          For in the early days of the faith when any one received a Greek
          manuscript into his hands and seemed to have ever so little
          facility in language, he dared to translate it" (De doctrina
          Christiana, ii, 11). Again (ii, 14) he mentions "the abundance
          of interpreters." Augustine is probably right in the supposition
          that Latin versions did not exist in pre-Christian times. At all
          events there are no traces of Jewish undertakings in this
          direction. The history of the Latin versions is divided into two
          unequal parts by the work of Jerome and closes with an account
          of later versions independent of Jerome, particularly those made
          by Protestants.

    1. The Latin Bible before Jerome.

      1. The Old Latin Bible. The Itala.

          The statement of Augustine about the great variety of Latin
          translations is corroborated by the documents, manuscripts, and
          quotations preserved, for the New Testament of course much more
          than for the Old. But even for the latter one may cite, e.g. for
          Deut. xxxi, 17, at least eight variant readings; and in the New
          Testament for Luke xxiv, 4, 5, at least twenty-seven variant
          readings. In other words, as Jerome says, "as many readings as
          copies"; and these readings are not merely different renderings
          of an identical Greek text, but correspond to various Greek
          readings, a fact which seems to demonstrate the more clearly the
          existence of different translations. Nevertheless Jerome speaks
          frequently as if there was but one ancient translation, which he
          opposes as "the common edition" and an "old translation" to his
          own undertaking. Some variations at least arose in the way
          sketched by Jerome--"by stupid interpreters badly translated, by
          presumptuous but unskilled men perversely amended, by sleepy
          copyists either added to or changed about." Nevertheless it is
          impossible to reduce all these variations to consecutive stages
          of one original translation and therefore scholars use the term
          "Old Latin versions" (in the plural) and avoid especially the
          name formerly used; viz., "Itala." This designation went back to
          a single passage of Augustine (De doctrina Christiana, ii, 14,
          15); after he had fixed the principle "that the uncorrected
          texts should give way to the corrected ones at least when they
          are copies of the same translation," he goes on to say: "Among
          translations themselves the Itala is to be preferred to the
          others, for it keeps closer to the words, without prejudice to
          clearness of expression." There can be no doubt that he puts
          here one translation, which he prefers, in opposition to several
          other translations; therefore it was not well done to comprehend
          all that is left of the Latin Bibles from the time before Jerome
          under this name Itala. Some have tried to change the text, but
          Itala is the correct reading. Augustine must mean a version used
          in or having come from Italy, probably the northern part of the
          peninsula. Isidore of Seville (Etymologiæ, vi, 4) in the seventh
          century clearly understood by "Itala" the work of Jerome. This
          view was restated in 1824 by C. A. Breyther, was considered
          possible by E. Reuss, and well founded by F. C. Burkitt (The Old
          Latin and the Itala, in TS, iv, 3), with the limitation that
          Augustine had not yet in view the whole of Jerome's labor, but
          only its beginning--the revision of the Gospels. It is therefore
          advisable to avoid completely the name "Itala" and to use "Old
          Latin" for the Bible before Jerome. The home of this Bible is
          not to be sought in Rome, where Greek was the language of the
          infant Church and its literature, but most probably in Africa.
          It is true, many of the linguistic peculiarities ascribed to
          Africa are shared by the lingua rustica in other parts of the
          Latin world, and it has become customary to distinguish an
          African and a European branch of the Latin Bible; nevertheless
          the origin of this whole literature seems to have been in
          Africa. Translations of certain books which in early times were
          of almost canonical standing--such as the Epistle of Barnabas,
          the Shepherd of Hermas, and the First Epistle of Clement--are
          closely connected with these versions (cf. Harnack, Litteratur,
          i, 883; O. Bardenhewer, Geschichte der altkirchlichen
          Litteratur, i, Freiburg, 1902).

      2. Manuscripts and Editions.

          Because the Old Latin versions have been replaced in the use of
          the Church by the version of Jerome, only a few manuscripts of
          the Old Latin have survived and these as fragments and
          palimpsests only, but of high antiquity. It is a great pity that
          they are not yet collected in such a way as to make their use
          easy, especially for the Old Testament, since they are all
          important for the criticism of the Septuagint. This was
          recognized by the Roman commission which prepared the Editio
          Sixtina of the Septuagint. They collected with great care the
          Biblical quotations from the Latin ecclesiastical writers.
          Petrol Morinus, Antonius Agellius, and Lælius Malwerda were the
          members of the commission to whom this part of the task was
          entrusted. Their labors were used in the scholia of the Greek
          edition of 1586 [1587], but still more freely in its Latin
          translation, published by Flaminius Nobilius (Rome, 1588;
          reprinted with the Greek text at Paris, 1624; without it,
          Venice, 1609, 1628; Antwerp, 1616). But the chief work is
          Bibliorum Sacrorum Latinæ versiones antiquæ . . . opera et
          studio Petri Sabatier, 0. S. B., e congregatione S. Mauri, (3
          vols., Reims, 1739-49, with new title, Paris, Didot, 1751).
          Before Sabatier, are to be mentioned J. M. Carus (Cardinal
          Tommasi), Sacrorum Bibliorum iuxta editionem seu LXX Interpretum
          seu B. Hieronymi veteres tituli, etc. (2 vols., Rome, 1688; 2d
          ed. in Thomasii Opera, ed. Vezzosi, i, Rome, 1747); and
          Ecclesiastes ex versione Itala cum notis Bossueti (Paris, 1693).
          For full list of manuscripts and editions, cf. the Hauck-Herzog
          RE, iii, 28-33. The manuscripts of the New Testament are
          enumerated also in Scrivener's Introduction, ii (London, 1894),
          45-54 (revised by H. J. White); in Gregory's Prolegomena to
          Tischendorf's New Testament, iii, 952-971, and Textkritik des
          Neuen Testaments (Leipsic, 1900), 598-613; and in the prefaces
          of Jerome's New Testament edited by J. Wordsworth and H. J.
          White (Novum Testamentum Domini nostri Jesu Christi Latine
          secundum editionem S. Hieronymi ad codicum manuscriptorum fidem
          recensuit Johannes Wordsworth. In operis societatem adsumpto
          Henrico Juliano White, part i, the four Gospels, Oxford,
          1889-98; part ii, section i, Acts, 1905). In the critical
          apparatus of the New Testament they are designated by the small
          letters of the Latin alphabet.

      3. Quotations in Latin Writers.

          Of the highest importance for the restoration of the Old Latin
          Bible are the quotations of the older Latin writers. Their
          countries are known and thus the home of the Biblical texts is
          located. Yet many questions are still unsettled; e.g., did
          Tertullian know and use a Latin translation or are his
          quotations taken by him from the Greek and translated into
          Latin? Heinrich Hoppe (Syntax und Stil des Tertullian, Leipsic,
          1903) denies that Tertullian knew a Latin version of the Old
          Testament. T. Zahn makes the same assertion for the New
          Testament.

          Quotations from almost all books are found in the Liber de
          divinis scripturis sive speculum (designated as m), ascribed to
          Augustine, published by A. Mai in Spicilegium Romanum, ix, 2
          (Rome, 1843), 1-88, and in Nova patrum bibliotheca, i, 2 (1852),
          1-117; better by F. Weihrich, in CSEL, xii (cf. Weihrich's
          dissertation, Die Bibel-Excerpte de divina scriptura, Vienna,
          1893). Several fragments are also in C. Vercellone,
          Dissertationi accademiche (Rome, 1864). On the quotations in
          general, cf. H. Rönsch, is ZHT, x, 1867, 606-634, 1869, 433-479,
          1870, 91-150, 1871, 531, 1875, 88; L. J. Bebb, in Studia Biblia,
          ii (London, 1890), 195 sqq.; Scrivener's Introduction (London,
          1894), 167-174; Gregory's Prolegomena, iii (Leipsic, 1894),
          1131-1246; and Kennedy, in DB, 52-53.

          The writers that are of primary importance are: Alcimus Avitus,
          archbishop of Vienna c. 450-517; Ambrose, bishop of Milan
          374-397; Ambrosiaster, the name liven to a most important
          commentator on the thirteen Epistles of St. Paul (cf. T. Zahn,
          in NKZ, xvi pp. 419 sqq., and A. Souter, TS, vii, 4, Cambridge,
          1905); Arnobius, presbyter in Africa fourth century;

          pascha computus (written in Africa c. 243); Liber de
          promissionibus (ascribed to Prosper of Aquitaine); Liber

          Mommsen in Collectio librorum juris antejustiniani, iii, Berlin,
          1891); Augustine, bishop of Hippo 354-430 (from this author
          alone Lagarde collected 13,276 quotations of the Old Testament
          and 29,540 of the New Testament); Capreolus, bishop of Carthage
          c. 431; Cassian, monk at Marseilles (d. about 435); Commodian
          (perhaps middle of third century); Cyprian, bishop of Carthage
          (d. 258; cf. Sanday, in OLBT, ii; Lagarde, Symmicta, i, 74;
          Mittheilungen, ii, 54; P. Corssen, Der cyprianische Text der
          Acta Apostolorum, Berlin, 1892); Teaching of the Twelve

          the time of Jerome); Lactantius (in Africa c. 260-340); Lucifer,
          bishop of Cagliari (d. 371; cf. Dombart, in Berliner

          Maternus (c. 345); Maximin (cf. TLZ, 1900, 17); Novatian (at
          Rome c. 252; cf. Harnack, in TU, xiii, 4); Origen (Latin

          Testament Tertullians, Leipsic, 1871, and J. N. Ott, in Neue
          Jahrbücher für Philologie, 1874, p. 856); Tyconius, in Africa,
          c. 340 (cf. F. C. Burkitt, in TS, iii, 1, 1894); Verecundus (cf.
          Lagarde, Septuagintastudien, i); Victorinus, bishop of Pettau in
          Pannonia, c. 300 (cf. Haussleiter, in ZWT, vii, 239-257);
          Vigilius, bishop of Thapsus, c. 484.

          Some parts of the Old Latin Bible are still in ecclesiastical
          use and even in the works of Luther Denifle has shown readings
          from this source. The same is the case with some of the
          translations in the vernacular dialects of medieval Europe, such
          as the Anglo-Saxon (cf. for instance R. Handke, Ueber das
          Verhältnis der westsächsischen Evangelienübersetzung zum
          lateinischen Original, Halle, 1896; A. S. Cook, Biblical
          Quotations in Old English Prose Writers, New York, 1898; Max
          förster, in Englische Studien, Leipsic, 1900, p. 480).

    2. The Bible of Jerome (the Vulgate):

      1. Jerome's Work. The New Testament.

          Toward the end of the fourth century the inconvenience from
          which the Western Church suffered because there was no single
          authorized Latin version of the Bible must have been seriously
          felt, and Damasus, bishop of Rome (d. 384), commissioned
          [223]Jerome to prepare an authoritative revision, probably in
          the year 382. The letter with which Jerome dedicated the first
          part (the Gospels) to the pope gives the only authentic record
          of the work and its scope (cf. NPNF, 2d ser., vi, 487-488).
          Jerome accepts the task set him by Damasus, notes its extreme
          difficulty and the resulting peril to himself, anticipates the
          harshest criticism of himself and of the results of his labor,
          and states that his emendations have been as conservative as
          possible. Not withstanding Jerome's modesty concerning his work,
          it has had an unparalleled history, inasmuch as it became the
          Bible of the whole Occident.

          To estimate Jerome's work properly, it would be necessary (1) to
          know what were the Latin texts which he had to revise; (2) what
          were the Greek texts which he chose as standard; (3) to have his
          work in its original form. The last is now realized, at least
          for the first part of the New Testament, since the monumental
          edition of Wordsworth-White. The Greek manuscript or manuscripts
          used by Jerome must have been of the type of the Codices
          Vaticanus and Sinaiticus; there are, however, some readings not
          attested by any Greek manuscript (cf., for instance, John x, 16,
          unum ovile; xvi, 13, docebit; and on this question cf. the
          letter of Wordsworth and White in The Academy, Jan. 27, 1894;
          their Epilogue, 657-672; E. Mangenot, in RSE, Jan., 1900). About
          Jerome's Latin texts there is still less information. Wordsworth
          and White printed under Jerome's text that of the Codex
          Brixianus (f) as most nearly related to it; but according to
          Burkitt and Kaufmann it is rather a text of Jerome himself
          adapted to the Gothic version. Jerome's statement in his
          prefatory letter that he changed as little as possible is
          probably true; for the language indicates that the Gospels came
          from different translators. Identical expressions in Greek are
          quite differently rendered into Latin (cf. the history of the
          Passion in the different Gospels, and notice for instance
          lagenam aquæ baiulans = amphoram aquæ portans or the rendering
          of "high priest" in Matthew by princeps sacerdotum, in Mark by
          summus sacerdos, in John by pontifex). It is, therefore, quite
          wrong to treat the Vulgate of the Gospels as a harmonious work,
          and it is clear that the value of it for textual criticism is
          greatly enhanced, since it preserves the text of the time when
          the Gospels were not yet united into one collection. Whether
          also in the second part of the New Testament such differences
          can be detected has not yet been investigated. It is not even
          quite certain how far Jerome revised the second part of the New
          Testament. Only the Gospels have his prefaces, and Augustine
          writes to him only of the Gospel: "We give no small thanks to
          God for your work in which you have interpreted the Gospel from
          the Greek." Jerome, however, answers: "If, as you say, you
          suspect me of emending the New Testament"; and in 398 he wrote
          to Lucinius Beticus, to whom he sent the first copy ready
          (Epist., lxxi, 5, NPNF, 2d series, vi, 154): "The New Testament
          I have restored to the authoritative form of the Greek." In his
          De vir. ill. he says: "The New Testament I have restored to the
          true Greek form, the Old I have rendered from the Hebrew."

      2. The Old Testament.

          Jerome's work on the Old Testament was more thorough. First he
          revised the Psalter [from the Septuagint] in 383 in Rome. This
          revision was introduced by Damasus into the liturgy and is hence
          called the Psalterium Romanum in distinction from the Psalterium
          vetus or the unrevised Old Latin. It was in use in Italy till
          Pius V (1566-72), and it is still used in St. Peter's in Rome
          and in Milan, partly in the Roman Missal and in one place in the
          Breviary, in the hortatory Psalm xcv (xciv). About four years
          later in Palestine Jerome revised the Psalms a second time,
          making use of the critical marks of Origen, the obelus and
          asterisk. This revision is known as the Gallican Psalter, as it
          was first used chiefly in Gaul (it seems through Gregory of
          Tours), but finally it became the current version in the Latin
          Church (through Pius V), of course without the critical marks.
          At last Jerome translated the Psalms from the Hebrew at the
          suggestion of Sophronius about 392 (not 405, as Lagarde has it);
          but this remained a private labor and is not found in many
          manuscripts. The best edition of this version is Lagarde's
          Psalterium juxta Hebræos Hieronymi (Leipsic, 1874).

          About the same time with his second revision of the Psalter
          Jerome revised the translation of Job (preserved in a few
          manuscripts, especially at Oxford and St. Gall; edited by
          Lagarde, Mittheilungen, ii, 189 sqq.; cf. Caspari, in Actes du
          huitième congrès des Orientalistes, i, Leyden, 1893, 37-51) and
          most of the books of the Old Testament; but he lost the work "by
          the deceit of somebody." Therefore he undertook the greater
          labor of translating the Old Testament afresh direct from the
          Hebrew. He began in 390 with Samuel and Kings and published them
          with his [224]Prologus galeatus; then followed Job, the
          Prophets, and Psalms. About the chronological order of the rest
          absolute certainty is not reached. [5] He left Wisdom,
          Ecclesiasticus, Maccabees, and Baruch without revision.
          According to his own statement he translated the three Solomonic
          writings in three days, Tobit in one day, Judith in one night;
          for the latter two his Jewish teacher translated to him the
          Aramaic into Hebrew and he dictated the Latin to a copyist (cf.
          G. Gr?tzmacher, Hieronymus, i, Leipsic, 1901, 73-77. On Jerome's
          method, cf. G. Hoberg, De S. Hieronymi ratione interpretandi,
          Bonn, 1886; M. Rahmer, Die hebräischen Traditionen in den Werken
          des Hieronymus, Breslau, 1861).

      3. History to the Invention of Printing.

          At first Jerome's work was not well received, especially because
          he had dared to part with the Septuagint, which even Augustine
          believed to be equally inspired with the original Hebrew. An
          African bishop on finding hedera ("ivy") in the Book of Jonah in
          the new version instead of the accustomed cucurbita ("gourd")
          raised a tumult in his Church. Jerome's former friend Rufinus
          wrote expressly against the new work. "So great is the force of
          established usage," says Jerome, "that even acknowledged
          corruptions [of text] please the greater part, for they prefer
          to have their copies pretty rather than correct." On the other
          hand he knows "that they attack it in public and read it in
          secret." At the time of his death (420) the attacks and
          criticism of his opponents had ceased.

          We are not informed where and when complete Bibles of Jerome's
          version were first produced and introduced into the use of the
          Church. In Spain it seems to have been at a pretty early time.
          Cassiodorus (d. about 570) was one of the first, if not the very
          first, who took care to produce correct copies. From his copies
          are derived the introductory pieces in the Codex Amiatinus (cf.
          H. J. White, in Studia Biblica, ii, Oxford, 1890, 273; P.
          Corssen, Die Bibeln des Cassiodorius, JPT, 1883, 1891). Pope
          Gregory the Great wrote at the end of the sixth century: "I
          indeed circulate the new translation; but when the course of
          argument demands it, I use now the new and now the old by way of
          proof; and this because the Apostolic See, over which under God
          I preside, uses both and by the study of both my toil is
          lightened." By that time the name Vulgata ("common,"
          "ordinary"), which before had meant the Septuagint and its Latin
          translation, had gone over to the work of Jerome. Roger Bacon
          says of it "that [version] which is diffused among the Latins is
          that which the Church receives in these days: "But even in the
          printed editions of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries this
          name is not yet as invariable as we are inclined to suppose; and
          despite the warning of Walafrid Strabo, "let none desire to
          amend one from the other," mixing in all degrees of the old and
          the new texts took place and survives up to the present not only
          in manuscripts, but even in the printed text, as when in II
          Kings i, 18, the first part is from the Old Latin, and the
          second from Jerome.

          Charlemagne found several recensions in use in his dominions. In
          a capitulary of 789 he ordered that there should be "in each
          monastery and parish good copies of the catholic books, and the
          boys must not be permitted to deface them either in reading them
          or by writing on them; and if there be necessity for writing
          [copying] a Gospel, Psalter, or Missal, men of maturity are to
          do it, using all care." In 797 he committed to [225]Alcuin the
          "emendation of the Old and the New Testament"; and the copy of
          the Biblical books, "bound together in the sanctity of one most
          glorious body," which Alcuin offered to him on Christmas 801,
          must have been the first copy of this revision, of which the
          Codex Vallicellanus at Rome is the best representative in
          existence. As Alcuin was himself of Northumbria, he probably had
          his text brought from there, and fortunately just there the
          purest text seems to have survived (cf. Berger's Histoire and
          Wordsworth-White). At the same time Bishop Theodulf of Orléans
          (787-821) worked at a revision, but on very different lines.
          Being a Visigoth, he took Spanish manuscripts as the basis, but
          incorporated in the margins various readings; fortunately his
          work found no large circulation. It is still represented by some
          fine manuscripts (cf. Berger, 145-184, and Delisle, in
          Bibliothèque de l'École des Charles, vol. xl, Paris, 1879).
          About the labors of [226]Lanfranc of Canterbury precise
          information is not obtainable; but the normal copy produced with
          the help of Jewish scholars by Stephen Herding, third abbot of
          Cîteaux for the members of his order is still preserved at Dijon
          (cf. J. P. Martin, in RSE, 1887). Later on, critical
          observations on the true readings of certain passages were
          collected in the so-called Correctoria Biblica. The principal
          Correctoria are (1) the Correctorium Parisiense, prepared about
          1236, also called Senonense, sneered at by Roger Bacon, who in
          1267 called the Parisian text, in a letter to Pope Clement IV,
          "horribly corrupt"; "the correctors," he says, are "corruptors,
          for any reader whatsoever in the lower orders corrects as he
          pleases, in like manner also the preachers, and similarly the
          students change as they like what they do not understand"; (2)
          the Correctorium Sorbonicum, a sort of epitome of the larger
          Correctoria; (3) the Correctorium of the Dominicans, prepared
          under the auspices of Hugo of St. Cher, which sometimes went
          back of the Latin text to Greek and Hebrew manuscripts; (4) the
          Correctorium Vaticanum, the work of the Franciscans, perhaps
          especially of Willermus de Mara. (Cf. on the Correctoria,
          besides S. Berger, in RTP; xvi, 41, especially Denifle, in
          Archiv für Litteratur-und Kirchengeschichte, iv, Berlin, 1883,
          263, 471.) By the influence of the University of Paris the text
          used there was the one which was most current in the Middle Ages
          and consequently that which found its way into the first printed
          editions, and gained thereby still more influence.

          To enumerate even the more important of the manuscripts of the
          Vulgate is here impossible. There are lists in J. Le Long,
          Bibliotheca sacra (i, Paris, 1723, 234 sqq.), and in C.
          Vercellone, Variæ lectiones vulgatæ Latinæ Bibliorum editionis
          (i, Rome, 1860, lxxxii sqq., ii, 1864, xvii sqq.). Scrivener's
          Introduction (ii, London, 1804, 67-90) has a select list of 181
          manuscripts, chiefly of the New Testament, by H. J. White;
          Berger's Histoire (Paris 1893, 374-422) one of 253; Gregory's
          Prolegomena (iii, Leipsic, 1894, 983-1108) notes some 2,270, and
          his Textkritik (2 vols., Leipsic, 1900-02) 2,369, reserving some
          for an appendix. H. J. White (DB, iv, 886-889) classifies them
          under the following headings: (1) Early Italian texts; (2) Early
          Spanish texts; (3) Italian texts transcribed in Britain; (4)
          Continental manuscripts written by Irish or Saxon scribes and
          showing a mixture of the two types of text; (5) Type of text
          current in Languedoc; (6) Other French texts; (7) Swiss
          manuscripts, especially of St. Gall; (8) Aleuinian recension;
          (9) Theodulfian recension; (10) Medieval texts.

      4. Earlier Printed Editions.

          Naturally Bibles and parts of the Bible were among the earliest
          of printed books, and as a matter of course the text presented
          was the Vulgate. The Mazarin Bible, so called, because a copy in
          the library of Cardinal Mazarin first attracted the attention of
          bibliographers--i.e., the Bible in forty- two lines, not that in
          thirty-six--is now proved to be the first Bible printed by
          Gutenberg. His Psalter of 1457 is the first book with a printed
          date, while the Psalter of 1459 is one of the most costly of
          books. A Bible printed at Mainz 1462 is the first dated Bible.
          The first Bible printed at Rome is of 1471, by Sweinheim and
          Pannartz, printed in 250 copies. Of ninety-two editions of the
          fifteenth century which can be localized, thirty-six belong to
          Germany (to Nuremberg 13, Strasburg 8, Cologne 7, Mainz 3,
          Speyer 2, Bamberg 1, and Ulm 1, the latter of 1480 being the
          first Bible with summaries); twenty-nine belong to Italy,
          twenty-four of them to Venice. In England in the whole period
          none is known. The first quarto Bible is believed to have been
          printed at Piacenza 1475, and the first octavo at Basel 1491
          (because of its small size called the first "poor man's Bible").
          An undated Bible, probably of 1478, has for the first time the
          verses:



          Fontibus ex græcis hebræorum quoque libris

          Emendata satis et decorata simul

          Biblia sum præsens, superos ego testor et astra.

          Copinger mentions 124 editions of the Latin Bible prior to 1500,
          of the sixteenth century he knows 438 editions, of the
          seventeenth 262, of the eighteenth 192, of the nineteenth (till
          1892) 133, in all 1,149. These figures show that, under the
          influence of the religious and intellectual awakening, the
          sixteenth century was the time of the Latin Bible.

          The bad state of the text soon became evident and attempts were
          made to improve it from the original texts, as by the editors of
          the Complutensian Polyglot (see [227]Bibles, Polyglot, I), and,
          among Protestants, first by Andreas Osiander (Nuremberg, 1522)
          and at Wittenberg, in an edition of the Pentateuch,
          Joshua-Kings, and the New Testament, ascribed to Luther and
          Melanchthon (1529), then by Lukas Osiander at Tübingen (9 vols.,
          1573-1586), with an "exposition." Of greater importance are the
          attempts to correct the text from the Latin manuscripts, to
          which Lorenzo della Valle had called attention in the fifteenth
          century. Erasmus published his In Latinam Novi Testamenti
          interpretationem ex collatione græcorum exemplarium annotationes
          apprime Wiles at Paris in 1505. The French printer [228]Robert
          Stephens in particular corrected the text from manuscripts and
          put variant readings on the margins (cf. Wordsworth, in OLBT, i,
          1883, 47-54). For his edition of 1528 he used three good
          manuscripts, for the larger of 1540 not less than seventeen; his
          impression of 1555 is the first complete Bible with the modern
          verse division, and his text became the basis of the official
          Roman text through the mediation of the edition undertaken by
          the theological faculty of Louvain under the guidance of
          Johannes Hentenius after comparison of some thirty manuscripts
          (Louvain, 1547).

      5. The Sixtine-Clemintine Edition.

          All these editions were private undertakings. In its fourth
          session (Apr. 8, 1546), the Council of Trent decreed that "of
          all Latin editions the old and vulgate (vulgata) edition be held
          as authoritative in public lectures, disputations, sermons, and
          expositions; and that no one is to dare or presume under any
          pretext to reject it." The council decreed at the same time that
          "this same old and vulgate edition be printed in as correct form
          as possible." It does not appear that steps were taken to
          entrust a special person or body with the latter task. The
          edition of Hentenius was used for a long time as the best
          available. At last several popes took the matter in hand, and
          after various attempts of Pius IV and Pius V, at last Sixtus V
          carried the work to completion through a committee, with
          Cardinal Antonio Caraffa at its head, and published the Biblia
          Sacra Vulgatæ Editionis tribus tomis distincta. Romæ: ex
          Typographia Apostolica Vaticana M.D.XC (on a second title-page:
          Biblia Sacra Vulgatæ Editionis ad concilii Tridentini
          præscriptum emendata et a Sixto V. P. M. recognita et
          approbata). In the constitution Æternus ille (Mar. 1, 1589; not
          included in the Bullarium Romanum; printed in Thomas James,
          Bellum papale, London, 1600, and L. van Ess, Geschichte der
          Vulgata, Tübingen, 1821, 269) Sixtus had declared the edition
          "true, lawful, authentic, and not to be questioned in
          disputations, either public or private." No future edition was
          to be published without the express permission of the Holy See,
          and for the next ten years it was forbidden to reprint it in any
          place except the Vatican; can; all future editions were to be
          carefully collated with it, "that no smallest part be changed,
          added to, or taken away," and they were to be accompanied with
          the official attestation of the inquisitor of the province or of
          the bishop of the diocese, no variant readings, scholia, or
          glosses being allowed on the margins. In August of 1590 Sixtus V
          died, and was followed by several short-lived popes; in 1592
          Clement VIII called in all copies of the edition which were
          within reach--copies are, therefore, of extreme rarity--and
          replaced it under the direction of Cardinal Bellarmine with a
          new Biblia Sacra Vulgatæ Editionis. Romæ: Ex Typographia
          Apostolica Vaticana M.D.XCII (on the second title-page: Biblia
          Sacra Vulgatæ Editionis Sixti Quinti Pont. Max. Jussu recognita
          atque edita). The accompanying bull decreed: "From the form of
          this copy let not even the least particle be changed, added to,
          or taken away, unless it happens that some fault is unmistakably
          due to typographical carelessness--let this be inviolably
          observed." The reasons for this whole proceeding are not quite
          clear. That the printing of the first edition was not correct
          enough is not true; as a matter of fact the Sixtine edition is
          typographically more correct than the Clementine, but the text
          of the Clementine is an improvement on that of the Sixtine.
          Sixtus was personally interested in the work and changed the
          text frequently to accord with that of Stephens, while the
          editors of the Clementine edition followed more often that of
          Hentenius. There are some 3,000 differences between the two
          editions. Nevertheless the names of both popes were placed on
          the title-pages of the later reprints, first, it seems, at
          Lyons, 1604, then at Mainz, 1609, the official title being now:
          Sixti V. et Clementis VIII. Pontt. Maxx. jussu recognita atque
          edita. A quarto edition was issued in 1593 with "marginal
          references, explanations of Hebrew names, and an index of
          subjects," and a small quarto edition in 1598 with a
          correctorium. All four editions (1590, 1592, 1593, 1598) are
          compared by Leander van Ess in his edition of the Vulgate (3
          parts, Tübingen, 1822-24). Of editions by other editors, those
          of C. Vercellone (Rome, 1861) and particularly M. Hetzenauer
          (Innsbruck, 1906) may be mentioned; the latter has useful
          appendices.

      6. Later Work. Problems.

          Since the edition of 1592 scarcely any attempt has been made in
          the Roman Church to apply to its Bible the most necessary
          emendation. D. Vallarsi printed an emended text (Verona, 1734),
          under the title Divina bibliotheca, in his edition of the works
          of Jerome. [A Biblical commission was appointed late in the
          pontificate of Leo XIII, and Pius X has lately commissioned
          members of the Benedictine Order to revise the Vulgate. It is
          intended to restore, so far as possible, the exact text of
          Jerome.] Among Protestants, Richard Bentley contemplated a new
          edition of the Latin New Testament together with the Greek (see
          [229]Bible Text, II, 2, § 3); about the same time [230]J. A.
          Bengal did much for it; in the nineteenth century S. Berger in
          France should have the greatest credit for clearing up the
          history of the Latin Bible; at last Wordsworth-White have issued
          what must be called the first critical edition of the Latin New
          Testament; and in Bavaria P. Thielmann is engaged in publishing
          those books of the Old Testament which were not translated by
          Jerome himself.

          It is a matter of surprise that a task so easy and interesting
          as the criticism of the Latin Bible has received so little
          attention. Berger knew more than 8,000 manuscripts of the Latin
          Bible; few of them have been properly investigated. What kind of
          surprises they may offer is shown by the recent discovery of two
          different translations of the Third Epistle of Paul to the
          Corinthians in two manuscripts of the tenth and thirteenth
          centuries at Milan and Laon. The order of the Biblical books in
          the manuscripts; the prefaces and summaries (cf. on this point
          Les Préfaces jointes aux livres de la Bible dans les manuscrits
          de la Vulgate; mémoire posthume de M. Samuel Berger, in the
          Mémoires de l'Académie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres, ser.
          i,. vol. xi, part 2, 1902); the capitulation and divisions; the
          illumination and miniatures (many of the manuscripts belong to
          the most beautiful productions of Christian art); ecclesiastical
          or private notes; connection with the vernacular versions,
          influence upon the dialects of Europe; lists of the passages in
          literature which mention manuscripts of the Latin Bible; and
          many other points may be named as those which await
          investigation.

  3. Later Latin Translations.

          That the Latin Vulgate was not sufficient was asserted in the
          Middle Ages by scholars like Nicolaus de Lyra and Raymond
          Martini. The English Benedictine Adam Easton (d. 1397) is said
          to have been one of the first to think of a new translation. It
          was Erasmus, however, who vindicated the right to place new
          Latin translations by the side of the Vulgate through his
          translation of the New Testament (Basel, 1516, 1519, 1522, 1527,
          1535, and more than 200 times since the death of Erasmus; see
          [231]Bible Text, II, 2, § 1; [232]Erasmus, Desiderius). He has
          had many followers who have translated into Latin either the Old
          or the New Testament or both, as well as separate books of the
          Bible, even as late as the nineteenth century. But the time has
          passed when Latin versions were necessary or helpful; since the
          Reformation translations into the vernacular languages have
          taken their place.

          The more important new translations of the whole Bible are those
          of the Dominican Sanctes Pagninus (Lyons, 1528; revised and
          annotated by Michael Servetus, Lyons 1542), of Arias Montanus in
          the Antwerp Polyglot (1572), and one prepared under the
          direction of Cardinal Cajetan (1530 sqq.; see [233]Cajetan,
          Thomas).

          The Old Testament was newly translated by the Hebraist Sebastian
          Münster (Basel 1534-35 and often); by Leo Jud and (after Jud's
          death) T. Bibliander, C. Pellican, P. Cholinus, and R.
          Gualtherus (Zurich, 1543); by Sebastian Castellio (complete ed.,
          Basel, 1651, with a dedication to King Edward VI of England); by
          Immanuel Tremellius, a Jew of Ferrara, and his son-in-law,
          Franciscus Junius. (du Jon; 5 parts, Frankfort, 1575-79; best
          ed., with full index, by P. Tossanus, Hanau, 1624. Tremellius's
          work was well received); by J. Piscator (24 parts, Herborn,
          1601-1616; really a revision of Tremellius); by Thomas Malvenda,
          a Spanish Dominican (left incomplete at Malvenda's death in 1628
          and first published with his Commentarii, 5 vols., Lyons, 1650);
          by J. Cocceius (published with his commentaries, Opera, vols.
          i-vi, Amsterdam, 1701; incomplete; contains also most of the New
          Testament); by Sebastian Schmid, a Strasburg Lutheran, who
          worked forty years on the translation (Strasburg, 1696;
          photographic facsimile, with manuscript notes by Swedenborg, ed.
          R. L. Tafel, Stockholm, 1872); by Jean Le Clerc (Claricus;
          Amsterdam, 1693-1731); by C. F. Houbigant (4 vols., Paris,
          1753); by J. A. Dathe (Halle, 1773-89); and by H. A. Schott and
          J. F. Winzer (Leipsic, 1816).

          Forty years after the first edition of the New Testament of
          Erasmus, Beza's Latin New Testament appeared (Geneva, 1556,
          1565, 1582, 1588, 1598, and more than 100 subsequent editions;
          by the BFBS, 1896). A translation by H. A. Schott was published
          at Leipsic in 1805. The latest works of the kind are by F. A. A.
          Näbe (Leipsic, 1831) and A. Göschen (Leipsic, 1832).

          Bible, cf. the Hauck-Herzog RE, iii, 49-58. On translations of
          the Psalms into Latin verse, cf. Hugues Vaganay, Les Traductions

  III. Syriac Versions.

    1. The Peshito.

      1. Origin and Name.

          According to some Syrians certain of the Biblical books
          (enumerated by Ishodad, bishop of Haditha, c. 852) were
          translated into Syriac under Solomon at the request of Hiram,
          king of Tyre. Another tradition refers this work to a priest Asa
          or Ezra, who was sent by the king of Assyria to Samaria, and the
          rest of the Old Testament with the New to the days of King Abgar
          V of Edessa and the apostle Addai (i.e., Thaddæus; see
          [234]Abgar. Cf. II Kings xvii, 24, I Chron. xv, 18, in the
          editions of Lee and Ceriani; J. P. N. Land, Anecdota Syriaca,
          iii, Leyden, 1870, 11; Bar Hebræus on Ps. x; JA, 1872, 458). Bar
          Hebræus makes the strange statement that, according to Eusebius
          (cf. Hist. eccl., VI, xvi, 4, and VI, xvii), Origen found the
          Syriac version in the keeping of a widow at Jericho; and equally
          curious is the tradition which refers the translation of the New
          Testament to Mark. Some manuscripts of the Psalms state that
          they were translated from Palestinian into Hebrew, from Hebrew
          into Greek, from Greek into Syriac. Theodore of Mopsuestia
          (commentary on Zeph. i, 6) rightly says: "These books were
          translated into Syriac by some one, but who he was no one knows
          to this day." Some scholars have thought to discover, at least
          for the New Testament, the influence of the Latin Vulgate; more
          probable is the supposition that at least some parts of the Old
          Testament are pre-Christian or certainly Jewish; and the home of
          the translation is not Jerusalem and Palestine (JA, 1872, 458)
          or Antioch, but Edessa and its neighborhood.

          The name which is commonly given to the oldest and most
          important Syriac version, "Peshito" ("Peshitto"), is first found
          with Moses bar Kepha (d. 913) and in Masoretic manuscripts of
          the ninth and tenth centuries (cf. N. P. S. Wiseman, Horæ
          Syriacæ, Rome, 1828, p. 223; J. P. P. Martin, Introduction à la
          critique textuelle du Nouveau Testament, Paris, 1883, p. 101;
          ZDMG, xxxii, 589). It means "the simple" in contradistinction to
          the more elaborate versions, such as that made from the Greek by
          Paul of Tella (see below, [235]2; on the name, cf. K. W. M.
          Montijn and J. P. N. Land, in Godgeleerde Bijdragen, 1882; F.
          Field, Origenis Hexapla, i, Oxford, 1875, p. ix; ZDMG, xlvii,
          157, 316; A. Mez, Die Bibel des Josephus, Basel, 1895, 4; F. C.
          Burkitt, Early Eastern Christianity, London, 1904, chap. ii).

      2. The Old Testament.

          The Syriac Old Testament is practically the same as that of the
          Palestinian Jews. Chronicles, however, was missing in the
          Nestorian canon and, as it seems, also in that of the Jacobites;
          at least it is not treated in their Masoretic manuscripts, but
          it is found in very old manuscripts. Ezra-Nehemiah too are not
          treated in the Masoretic manuscripts nor Esther by the
          Nestorians, while in Jacobite manuscripts this book together
          with Judith, Ruth, Susanna, and Thecla forms the "Book of Women"
          (cf. A. Baumstark, in Oriens Christianus, iii, Leipsic, 1901,
          353). After the Law there follows as the second part the "Book
          of Sessions," i.e., Job, Joshua, Judges, Samuel, Kings,
          Proverbs, Ecclesiasticus, Ecclesiastes, Ruth, Song of Solomon.
          Among the prophets, Isaiah (sometimes divided at xxv, 2) is
          followed by the minor prophets, then Jeremiah (with a division
          at xxxii, 6) with Baruch i-ii and the Epistle of Jeremiah, then
          Ezekiel and Daniel.

          Manuscripts with the Apocrypha are called "catholic" or
          "pandects"; they do not contain I Esdras, Tobit, or the Prayer
          of Manasses, but have an Apocalypse of Baruch, IV Esdras, and
          even the story of Shamuna and Josephus, War, V, as IV and V
          Maccabees. Tobit, as far as chap. vii, 11, is preserved only in
          the translation of Paul of Tella, but from that point on there
          is a still later text. Accurate manuscripts give stichometrical
          lists (cf. Martin, Introduction, 677; J. R. Harris, On the
          Origin of the Ferrar Group, London, 1893, 10, 26; DB, iv, 650).

          The character of the translation is different in various books;
          it is very literal in the Law, influenced by the Septuagint in
          Isaiah and the minor prophets, probably also in the Psalms. Ruth
          is paraphrastic. Chronicles resembles a Jewish targum, while the
          Syriac Proverbs has been used in the Targum. Ecclesiasticus is
          taken from the Hebrew.

      3. The New Testament.

          Up to 1858 only one old version of the New Testament in Syriac
          was known in Europe; viz., that published for the first time by
          J. A. Widmanstadt (Vienna, 1555). Textual critics considered it
          "the queen of the Bible translations." In 1858 W. Cureton
          published in London, from manuscripts which had come into the
          British Museum in 1842, Remains of a very Antient Recension of
          the Four Gospels in Syriac hitherto Unknown in Europe. The great
          value of this recension was soon recognized, and was greatly
          enhanced when, in 1892, a second manuscript of it was discovered
          in a palimpsest on Mount Sinai by Mrs. A. S. Lewis and her
          sister, Mrs. M. D. Gibson, which was published under the title,
          The Four Gospels in Syriac Transcribed from the Sinaitic
          Palimpsest by the Late R. L. Bensly . . . J. R. Harris . . . and
          F. C. Burkitt. With an Introduction by Agnes Smith Lewis
          (Cambridge, 1894). Mrs. Lewis published Some Pages of the Four
          Gospels Retranscribed from the Syriac Palimpsest with a
          Translation of the Whole Text (London, 1894). F. C. Burkitt
          published Evangelion da-Mepharreshe: The Curetonian Version of
          the Four Gospels, with the Readings of the Sinai Palimpsest and
          the Early Syriac Patristic Evidence Edited, Collected, and
          Arranged (vol. i, text and translation, vol. ii, introduction
          and notes, Cambridge, 1904). Burkitt's title is taken from the
          heading or subscription of the two manuscripts and means "the
          Gospel of the Separated" (i.e., "the Separated Gospels"), used
          in contradistinction to the Diatessaron of Tatian, which was
          called among the Syrians "the Gospel of the Combined" ("the
          Combined Gospels"). Herein is indicated the first problem in the
          history of the Syriac New Testament. It is well known that a
          harmony of the Gospels was used in the Syriac Church till the
          beginning of the fifth century, when Theodoret removed the
          copies in his diocese, and Rabbulas of Edessa ordered that the
          "Gospel of the Separated" should be read in church. The great
          question concerns the relationship of the Peshito, the
          Mepharreshe, and Tatian. It seems certain that the three are
          interrelated. It seems further to have been proved by Burkitt
          that the Peshito is the latest, and is in all probability the
          revision which Rabbulas of Edessa (d. 435) is said to have
          undertaken. The decision of the other question, whether the
          Mepharreshe or Tatian is the earlier, is made difficult by the
          fact that Tatian's work is not preserved in its original form,
          and further by the fact that the two representatives of the
          Mepharreshe, the manuscripts of Cureton and Lewis, differ
          greatly. But on the whole it seems most probable that Tatian was
          the first to bring the Gospel to the Syrians in the form of his
          Diatessaron, and that then on the basis of his harmony the
          version of the separate Gospels originated. Burkitt is inclined
          to believe that this was toward the end of the second century,
          perhaps under the influence of the Church of Antioch, through
          Paul of Edessa. The opposite view, that the Mepharreshe is
          earlier than Tatian, is taken by Hjelt, who believed he was able
          to show that the Gospels in the Mepharreshe were translated by
          different hands, and that the first Gospel especially betrays a
          Jewish character. Without the discovery of new evidence the
          question will be very difficult to decide.

          No manuscript of an early Syriac version of the Acts and the
          Pauline Epistles is known. But that there was an older version
          can be proved from the quotations of such early writers as
          Aphrarates and Ephraem, and perhaps also from readings in the
          Armenian version. In early times the apocryphal correspondence
          with the Corinthians was placed with the Epistles of Paul. The
          Catholic Epistles were at first totally unknown, as is expressly
          stated by Theodore of Mopsuestia and Theodore bar Koni (cf. A.
          Baumstark, in Oriens Christianus, i, 176, iii, 555). In the
          Peshito as we have it the three greater of them are found, in
          accordance with the use of the Church of Antioch. Still later
          the four others were added. It is strange that the Nestorian
          inscription of Singan-fu (see [236]Nestorians) speaks of
          twenty-seven books of the New Testament. Revelation never formed
          part of the canon among the Syrians (cf. on the Syriac canon, T.
          Zahn, Grundriss der Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons,
          Leipsic, 1904, § 6; J. A. Bewer, The History of the New
          Testament Canon in the Syrian Church, Chicago, 1900; W. Bauer,
          Der Apostolos der Syrer, Giessen, 1903), and whether the Pauline
          collection included Philemon can not be decided.

    2. Later Versions.

          The Nestorian patriarch Mar Abba (d. 552) is said by Bar
          Hebræus, Ebed Jesu, and Amru to have translated and explained
          the Old and New Testaments from the Greek; but nothing more is
          known about it.

          In 508 Philoxenus of Mabug with the help of his coadjutor
          Polycarp translated at least some parts of the Old Testament and
          undertook a new version of the New Testament. Parts of Isaiah
          preserved in a manuscript of the British Museum may belong to
          this version (ed. A. Ceriani, Monumenta sacra et profana, v, 5,
          Milan, 1873, 1-40). According to Bernstein, the Gospels are
          contained in manuscript A2 of the Angelican library at Rome.
          Isaac H. Hall published a Syriac Manuscript. Gospels from a
          pre-Harklensian Version, Acts and Epistles of the, Peshitto
          Version, Written (probably) between 700 and 900 A.D. Presented
          to the Syrian Protestant College [Beirut] (Philadelphia, 1884).
          The minor epistles, first published by E. Pococke in 1630 and
          since often found in editions of the Syriac New Testament, are
          very likely part of this version, and so is the version of
          Revelation discovered by J. Gwynn and published by him (Dublin,
          1897).

          About one hundred years later the work of translation was
          resumed, for the Old Testament, by Paul of Tella (the so-called
          Syro-Hexaplar version; see above, [237]I, 1, § 6), and, for the
          New Testament, by Thomas of Heraclea (Harkel in Mesopotamia).
          This version was published by J. White under the inappropriate
          title, Versio Philoxeniana (Oxford, 1778-1803). A lacuna in the
          Epistle to the Hebrews was filled in by R. L. Bensly (Harklean
          Version of the Epistle to the Hebrews xi, 28-xiii, 25, London,
          1889). W. Deane began a new edition but was prevented from
          finishing it. Its completion, especially for the Acts, is much
          to be desired. For his marginal notes, Thomas made use of a
          manuscript closely related to the Greek codex D (cf. A. Pott,
          Der abendländische Text der Apostelgeschichte, Leipsic, 1900,
          and Hilgenfeld, in ZWT, xliii, 1900, p. 3). The Syriac text of
          Revelation published by De Dieu (Leyden, 1627) and now in the
          common Syriac New Testaments belongs to this version (cf. J.
          Gwynn, in Hermathena, 1898, 227-245).

          On the revision of the Old Testament undertaken by Jacob of
          Edessa in 704-705, cf. Kamphausen, in TSK, 1869, 753, and A.
          Ceriani, Monumenta sacra et profana, v, 1 (Milan, 1871).

          Mention must also be made of the Palestinian version (used by
          the Melchite Church in Palestine and Egypt). Of the Old
          Testament, only fragments remain. The New Testament has been
          known from an evangeliarium at Rome since 1789 (published by F.
          Miniscalchi-Erizzo, Verona, 1861-1864, and by Lagarde,
          Bibliotheca Syriaca, Göttingen, 1892). Since that time many new
          texts have been brought to light, especially through Mrs. Lewis.
          A full list is given in the Lexicon syropalæstinum of F.
          Schulthess (Berlin, 1903), pp. vii-xvi. F. C. Burkitt (JTS, ii,
          183) gives reasons for believing that this literature may have a
          connection with the attempts of Justinian in the fifth century
          to extirpate the Samaritans, and of Heraclius early in the sixth
          century to harass the Jews. This peculiar dialect is important
          lexically, as being closely akin to the language spoken in
          Galilee.

          Bibliography: The first parts of the Bible printed in Syriac are
          in Ambrosius Theseus, Introductio in Chaldaicam linguam,
          Syriacum alque Armenicam, Pavia, 1539 (cf. ZDMG, lviii, 1904,
          601). The Old Testament appeared first in the Paris Polyglot,
          vols. vi-ix, 1632-45, then in the London Polyglot, vols. i-iv,
          1654-57, reprinted by S. Lee for the BFBS, London, 1823 (other
          copies, 1824; on their differences--one set contains Ps. cli,
          the other not--cf. ZDMG, lix, 1905, 31), and at Urumiah (with
          modern Syriac added), 1852. The text is very bad, resting on a
          single late manuscript at Paris adapted by Gabriel Sionita,
          editor of the Paris Polyglot, from which the London Polyglot and
          Lee took it with scarcely any correction the Urumiah edition, at
          least in some parts, with but few corrections (cf. W. E. Barnes,
          An Apparatus critical to Chronicles in the Peshitta Version,
          Cambridge, 1897; G. Diettrich, Ein Apparatus criticus zur
          Pe?itto zum Propheten Jesaia, Giessen, 1905). Bernstein and
          Rahlfe have published emendations, the former in ZDMG, iii,
          1849, 387-396, the latter in ZATW, ix, 1889, 161-210. A. M.
          Ceriani published a photographic reproduction of the Codex
          Ambrosianus, Milan, 1876-83. The Apocrypha was published by
          Lagarde, Leipsic, 1861. The first critical edition of the
          Gospels was by P. E. Pusey and G. H. Gwilliam, Oxford, 1901; for
          the rest of the New Testament there are the editions of the
          American mission at Urumiah, 1846, New York, 1846, etc. The
          edition most used in textual criticism hitherto has been that of
          J. Leusden and C. Schaaf, Leyden, 1709 and 1717, reprinted by
          Jones, Oxford, 1805 (cf. Tischendorf on Matt. x, 8, with the
          note of Pusey-Gwilliam). The entire Bible was printed by the
          Dominicans at Mosul, 1887-91. A list of editions to 1888 is

  IV. The Samaritan Pentateuch.

          This must not be confounded with the Hebrew text of the
          Pentateuch in Samaritan characters or with the Arabic version
          used by the Samaritans. All three are contained in the famous
          triglot manuscript in the Barberini Library at Rome of the year
          1227 (for facsimile cf. G. M. Bianchini's Evangeliarium
          quadruplex, Rome, 1749, or, on a reduced scale, F. G. Kenyon,
          Our Bible and the Ancient Manuscripts, London, 1896, pl. v). The
          question of the age of this targum depends on the decision of
          the question whence the readings are taken which are found under
          the rubric to Samaraitikon in some fifty marginal notes of
          Origen's Hexapla (to the passages collected by Field add Lev.
          xv, 8; Deut. viii, 22, xxxiv, 1-3, from the margins of Lagarde's
          Bibliotheca Syriaca). The most probable view seems to be that
          not Origen but Eusebius took these notes from the Hebrew
          Pentateuch as used among the Samaritans. On a Samaritan
          inscription found at Amwas (Emmaus) cf. Revue Biblique, 1896, p.
          433.

          E. Nestle.

          The Samaritan Pentateuch is essentially the same as the Hebrew.
          The variations, aside from those of a linguistic character, are
          the following: the narrative of action or declaration by Moses
          is often preceded by the statement that he acted or spoke by
          divine direction; Gen. ii, 2a, "seventh" is changed to "sixth";
          anthropomorphisms are removed, and in Gen. xx, 13, xxxi, 53,
          xxxv, 7, Ex. xxii, 8, the plural predicate after Elohim is
          changed to the singular to avoid a polytheistic implication;
          "Ebal" (Deut. xxvii, 4) was displaced by Gerizim for national
          reasons. The Samaritan Pentateuch is proved by these changes to
          be a revision of the Jewish, but a revision made in early times
          (possibly pre-Christian), though the modern tendency is to
          ascribe the text now extant to the second Christian century.

          Bibliography: The text was first printed in the Paris Polyglot,
          1643, then in Walton's Polyglot, 1657. Other editions of the
          whole or of parts are: A. Brüll, Das samaritanische Targum zum

  V. Aramaic Versions (The Targams).

    1. Origin and Language.

          These are Aramaic paraphrases of the Old Testament (targum =
          "interpretation, translation," from targem, "to explain,
          translate"; cf. Ezra iv, 7) prepared for use in the synagogue,
          and took their rise from the custom of repeating and explaining
          the Hebrew sacred text in the Aramaic tongue, which after the
          exile became the vernacular of the Jews in Palestine and
          elsewhere. At first the targum was a free oral exposition; then
          it gradually acquired fixed form, and at last was reduced to
          writing. It is frequently found in manuscripts following the
          Hebrew text verse by verse. When the Law was read, the
          paraphrase was given after every verse; with the Prophets three
          verses were allowed to be taken together.

          The language of the Targums used to be called Chaldee, because
          Jerome so named the Aramaic portions of the Hebrew Bible, which
          are written in a dialect very akin to that of the Targums. In
          reality, these have preserved the Jewish form of the Aramaic,
          the next cognate dialect being Syriac, the form of the Aramaic
          used by the Christians of Edesea, while still other cognate
          dialects are those of the Palmyrene inscriptions and of the
          Samaritans (see [238]Semitic Languages). The grammatical and
          lexicographical use of the Targums is hampered by the fact that
          no edition has as yet appeared that takes account of all the
          materials now available. Mercier vocalized the texts after the
          Syriac, Buxtorf after the Biblical Aramaic; the edition printed
          by Foa (Sabbionetta, 1557) seems to rest on a manuscript in
          which the supralinear system of vocalization had been changed
          into that of Tiberias, but with many faults and inconsistencies.
          The most original system of vocalization is that preserved in
          manuscripts from Yemen, on which cf. the works of Merx,
          Berliner, Landauer, Kautzsch, Margoliouth (The Superlinear
          Punctuation, in PSBA, xxiii, 164-205), and Barnstein (The Targum
          of Onkelos to Genesis, London, 1896), and the editions of
          Prätorius (Joshua, Berlin, 1899; Judges, 1900).

    2. Targum Onkelos.

          For the greater part of the Old Testament there is more than one
          Targum. One on the Pentateuch is attributed in some passages of
          the Talmud to the helpers of Ezra. According to the Babylonian
          Talmud (Megillot 3a), Onkelos delivered it orally in Palestine;
          but this is the result of confusing Onkelos with Aquila, who
          translated the Old Testament into Greek (see above, [239]I, 2,
          § 1), and "Judaic Pentateuch-Targum" is a better name than
          "Targum of Onkelos," which has been in use since Bomberg's
          Rabbinic Bible of 1517. In the third century its text seems to
          have been considered fixed, and manuscripts are mentioned
          several times, but Origen and Jerome apparently did not know a
          Targum, and hence we may conclude that it did not find official
          recognition before the fifth century. Its language is different
          from that of both Talmuds, and seems to render the original into
          the language of the place and time of its origin (Palestine) as
          faithfully as a translation which is somewhat paraphrastic can
          do. The Hebrew text on which it rests is practically our
          Masoretic text, and it is of interest as representing the
          exegetical tradition of the Jews. It is quite literal, gives a
          messianic interpretation of Gen. xlix, 10, and Num. xxiv, 17,
          additions to Gen. xlix, Num. xxiv, Deut. xxxii, 33, and avoids
          all anthropomorphisms. Like the Hebrew text, it has been the
          subject of Masoretic studies, which have been edited by Berliner
          (Die Massorah zum Targum Onkelos, Leipsic, 1877).

    3. Targum Jonathan.

          The Targum of the Prophets has been ascribed to Jonathan ben
          Uzziel, Hillel's greatest disciple; others give as its redactor
          Joseph ben Hiyya of Babylon (d. about 333); but it did not
          receive its final written form before the fifth century. It is
          more paraphrastic than the Targum of the Law, which induced
          Cornill to think that it is older. Eichhorn and Bertholdt
          thought they recognized different hands. The paraphrase is
          greatly influenced by the book of Daniel. Isa. liii is
          understood of the Messiah, whose suffering atones for Israel.
          Great enmity is shown against Rome.

    4. Other Targums of the Law and Prophets.

          The two Targums just described represent the Judaic Aramaic; of
          a mixed character is the language of Targums Yerushalmi I and II
          on the Law. Some verses are missing from the former, and the
          latter is preserved only in fragments. Certain other fragments
          found in various manuscripts and editions of the Pentateuch are
          designated by Dalman (Grammatik, § 6, 3) as Yerushalmi III.
          There are similar fragments of a Targum on the Prophets
          published by Lagarde from the margins of Reuchlin's codex (on
          which cf. Bacher, in ZDMG, xxviii). Bassfreund (Das
          Fragmententargum zum Pentateuch, Breslau, 1896) and similarly
          Dalman (Grammatik, § 6, 4) see in Onkelos the oldest Palestinian
          Targum and in Yerushalmi I and II a later development. M.
          Ginsburger, on the contrary (Pseudo-jonathan, Berlin, 1903,
          preface), and Bacher find in them traces of a very old
          Palestinian Targum, which has been worked over by Onkelos. The
          comment in these pieces is sometimes very fantastic.

    5. The Hagiographa.

          The Targums of the Hagiographa are not translations, but
          commentaries; the Targum of the Song of Solomon, for instance,
          is a panegyric of the Jewish nation with foolish anachronisms,
          the Targum of the Psalms is in some parts literal, in others
          explanatory. The Targum of Proverbs is a working over of the
          Syriac translation (cf. Pinkuss, in ZATW, xiv, 65, 161). As the
          Hagiographa were not read in the Synagogue as regularly as the
          Law and the Prophets (cf. Lk. iv, 16; Acts xiii, 15; xv, 21),
          their Targums are to some extent private literary works of
          differing character. For Ezra-Nehemiah and Daniel no Targum is
          known, unless the Aramaic parts of Daniel are fragments of a
          Targum. For Esther there are two Targums.

  VI. The Armenian Version.

          The Armenian translation of the Old Testament rests on the
          Greek, though it shows in certain passages and books traces of
          revision either from the Syriac or from the Hebrew. The Greek
          text used seems to have been dependent on Origen, for in some
          Armenian manuscripts hexaplaric marks are found. In the
          manuscripts (not in the printed editions) various
          pseudepigraphic books appear. The Armenian Psalter printed for
          the British and Foreign Bible Society at Venice, 1850, was
          rejected in consequence of these additions. Ecclesiasticus has
          been translated twice, first in the fifth century, this version
          being printed in the Venice Bible, 1860; again probably in the
          eighth century, found in Zohrab's edition of the Armenian Bible
          of 1805. On the statements of Koriun, Lazar of Parpi, and Moses
          of Chorene, that the Scriptures were translated by Mesrob,
          Sahag, Eznik, and others between 396 and 430 from manuscripts
          brought from Edessa, Constantinople, and Alexandria, cf.
          Conybeare, DB, i, 152 (see [240]Armenia, II, §§ 2-3). A
          collation of the Armenian version was made for Holmes-Parsons
          (see above, [241]I, 1, § 2), and is being made afresh for the
          forthcoming Cambridge Septuagint by McLean (cf. Swete,
          Introduction, London, 1900, p. 118). Theodoret states that in
          his time the language of the Hebrews was translated into that of
          the Armenians, Scythians, and Sauromatians. A concordance to the
          Armenian Bible has been printed in the cloister of San Giacomo
          at Jerusalem (1895). The uncanonical writings of the Old
          Testament found in Armenian manuscripts in the library of San
          Lazzaro were translated into English by J. Issaverdens (Venice,
          1901); on Ter Moosesjan's History of the Translation of the
          Bible into Armenian, cf. H. Goussen, in Nouvelle Revue de
          Théologie, 1904, p. 9.

          For the New Testament Mill used some notes on the Armenian
          version by W. Guise and L. Piques. For Tregelles C. Rieu
          collated Zohrab's edition of 1805. His notes were used by
          Tischendorf in the eighth edition of his New Testament; Gregory
          catalogued sixty-four manuscripts in Europe (outside of Russia)
          and America. At Moscow is a copy of the Gospels dated 887, at
          Echmiadzin is the manuscript 222 written in 989, but with an
          ivory binding which is much older. Conybeare discovered in this
          manuscript, after Mark xvi, 8, the words Ariston eritzou ("of
          the presbyter Arist[i]on"), which probably preserve the name of
          the author of the close of the second Gospel. The Gospels have
          invariably the so-called Ammonian sections; the Acts and
          Epistles of Paul, the Euthalian additions (see [242]Ammonius of
          Alexandria; [243]Euthalius); at their end is found the
          apocryphal correspondence of Paul with the Corinthians. After
          John follows sometimes the apocryphal "Rest of John." The
          Apocalypse is said to be a recension made by Nerses Lambron in
          the twelfth century; a much older version is indicated by H.
          Goussen (cf. Gregory, Textkritik, Leipsic, 1902, p. 568). The
          inclusion of the apocryphal correspondence of Paul with the
          Corinthians and other characteristics of this version and the
          whole history of the Armenian Church confirm the view that the
          Armenian version was first based on the Syriac Bible and
          afterward revised from the Greek; cf. on this question Conybeare
          and Burkitt.

  VII. Egyptian Coptic Versions.

          According to Zosimus Panopolitanus, the Hebrew Bible was
          translated into Egyptian at the same time as the Septuagint (see
          above, [244]I, 1, § 6); according to the life of St. Anthony, he
          heard the Gospel read in church in the Egyptian language. But
          the latter statement is not certain enough to justify the
          supposition that the Egyptian version of the New Testament goes
          back to the middle of the third century. At that time
          Christianity in Egypt seems to have been restricted to the
          Greek-speaking towns. Modern scholars distinguish linguistically
          as many as five or six Coptic dialects; for the textual critic
          the Coptic versions fall into three divisions, although a former
          generation knew only one and called it the Coptic, i.e., the
          Egyptian, version. These divisions are: (1) The Saidic or the
          version of Upper Egypt, sometimes called the Thebaic; (2) the
          Fayyumic (formerly called the Bashmuric), with which text the
          fragments in the Middle-Egyptian dialect agree; (3) the version
          now in ecclesiastical use among all Copts or Egyptian
          Christians, called Bohairic. The Bohairah ("Lake") is a district
          near Alexandria and Lake Mareotis, the modern Beherah. There is
          a fourth dialect called Akhmimic; but the version of the
          Catholic Epistles in this dialect, preserved in a very ancient
          manuscript, is properly classed with the Saidic version.
          Bashmuric had already died out in the time of Athanasius.

          The Bohairic version was for a long time the only one known to
          European scholars, and is still supposed by some to be the
          earliest version in any Egyptian dialect; but with better reason
          others see in it a late recension, characterized by greater
          faithfulness to the Greek, the basal Greek text being best
          represented by the Greek Codex L and, among the Fathers, not by
          Clement and Origen, but by Cyril. Of the Saidic manuscripts some
          of the more ancient are bilingual, the Greek occupying the page
          on the left hand of the open book; the Bohairic manuscripts, on
          the contrary, are often accompanied by an Arabic translation,
          but there is no instance of a Greco-Bohairic manuscript. When
          written in two columns the Greco-Saidic manuscripts have both
          Greek columns on the left and both Saidic on the right, and
          occasionally the two pages of the codex give different readings.
          The text of this version generally supports that represented by
          Codex B, but it has some strange "Western" singularities; for
          instance, to Luke xxiii, 53, it is added that Joseph placed a
          stone at the door of the sepulcher, which twenty men were
          scarcely able to move, and in the parable of the rich man and
          Lazarus the name of the former is given as "Nineveh." Revelation
          seems to have been considered uncanonical, for it is not found
          with the rest of the New Testament.

  VIII. The Ethiopic Version.

          In Ethiopic there exists a translation of the Bible which has
          continued the only one authorized among Abyssinian Christians,
          and even among the Jewish Falashas; and it still maintains its
          ancient authority, although the Ethiopic long ago ceased to be
          spoken. There is no reliable information as to the exact time or
          manner of its origin; but it is certain that it was made from
          the Septuagint in the early days of Abyssinian Christianity,
          between the fourth and the sixth century. It is very faithful,
          being, for the most part, a verbal rendering of the Greek,
          readable and fluent, and in the Old Testament often renders
          closely the ideas and the words of the Hebrew.

          Dillmann projected an edition of the Ethiopic Old Testament in
          five volumes, of which he lived to publish vols. i, Gen.-Ruth
          (1853), ii, Sam.-Kings (1861-71), and v, the Apocrypha (1894).
          He arranged the manuscripts in three groups: (1) those which
          contain the original translation from the Septuagint
          uncorrupted; (2) those the text of which has been revised and
          completed from the Greek; (3) those which have been corrected
          from the Hebrew. From the circumstance that the Ethiopic Church
          was dependent on that in Egypt, it is probable that the
          particular recession of the Septuagint from which the Ethiopic
          translation was made was the Hesychian (see above, [245]I, 1,
          § 5). But the early Aramaic speaking missionaries influenced the
          translation, as is shown by the numerous Aramaic words which are
          employed to convey Christian ideas. Possibly the Bible was
          translated, at least in part, by these missionaries or their
          pupils.

          The division into chapters was introduced at a later day into
          Abyssinia, under European influences. The Ethiopic Bible
          includes the Apocrypha, except the books of Maccabees, which
          were either not translated or very early lost, and several
          pseudepigrapha, and puts them upon perfect equality with the
          canonical writings; and in this way the number of books is given
          as eighty-one, forty-six for the Old Testament, thirty-five for
          the New. (See [246]Abyssinia and the Abyssinian Church.)

          Abyssinian Tasfa-Sion or, as he is also called, Peter the
          Ethiopian, reprinted in the London Polyglot. An ed. was issued
          by T. P. Platt for the BFBS in 1828-30, reprinted at Leipsic,
          1899.

  IX. The Georgian (Iberian) Version.

          The earliest translations of parts of the Bible in the language
          of the Iberians belong to the fifth century, and seem to betray
          the influence of the Syriac version. David and Stephen in the
          eight century are the first names known of men engaged in
          revision of the Iberian Bible. A papyrus Psalter is assigned to
          the seventh or eighth century, and a copy of the Gospels is
          dated a century later (facsimile in Tsagareli). The edition
          printed at Moscow, 1743, has been retouched from the Slavonic.
          S. C. Malan in 1862 used this version for his edition of the
          Gospel of John. On the Georgian manuscripts of the library at
          Paris there is a recent paper by A. Khakhanov.

  X. The Gothic Version of Ulfilas.

          [247]Ulfilas, the Moses of the Goths, as Constantine styled him
          (cf. TSK, 1893, 273), was made bishop probably in 341 at Antioch
          and died in 381 or 383. He gave to his people the alphabet and
          the Bible, but, according to Philostorgius (Hist. eccl., ii, 5),
          omitted to translate the books of Kings because he thought they
          contained too much about war for the good of his fierce
          countrymen. Of the Old Testament very few fragments are left;
          viz., Gen. v, 3-30; Ps. lii, 2-3; Ezra xv (i.e. Neh. v), 13-16;
          xvi, 14-xvii, 3; xvii, 13-45. The translation follows the
          recension of Lucian (see above, [248]I, 1, § 5). The Gothic
          priests Sunnias and Fretela, who were in correspondence with
          Jerome about the true readings of certain passages in the
          Psalter some twenty years after the death of Ulfilas (cf.
          Jerome, Epist., cvi), were perhaps engaged in a revision of the
          Gothic Psalms. That the Psalms were sung in Gothic at
          Constantinople is testified by Chrysostom (cf. the dissertation
          of J. Mühlau, Zur Frage nach der gotischen Psalmenübersetzung,
          Kiel, 1904). On the fragments of Ezra (Nehemiah), cf. E.
          Langner, Die gotischen Nehemia-fragmente (Sprottau, 1903).

          More of the New Testament is preserved, thanks to the Codex
          Argenteus now in Upsala, also by a palimpsest from Weissenburg
          discovered in Wolfenbüttel in 1756, and fragments at Turin
          discovered by Angelo Mai in 1817 and by Reifferscheid in 1886.
          The Codex Argenteus must have had a very near relationship to
          Codex f. of the Latin Bible (cf. M. Haupt, Die Vorrede der
          gotischen Bibelübersetzung, in his Opuscula, vol. iii, Leipsic,
          1876; Burkitt, JTS, i, 129; Kauffmann, ZDP, xxxii, 305-335;
          Dräseke, ZWT, 1907). It was perhaps part of a Greek, Gothic, and
          Latin Testament. The version is very faithful, following the
          text used by Chrysostom. More than 100 Greek and Latin words
          were retained by Ulfilas (cf. C. Elis, Ueber die Fremdwörter und
          fremden Eigennamen in der gotischen Bibelübersetzung, Göttingen,
          1903).

B. Modern Versions.

  I. Arabic Versions.

          "There are more Arabic versions of the Gospels than can be
          welcome to theology, with its press of work," wrote Lagarde in
          the preface of his edition of the four Gospels in Arabic
          (Leipsic, 1864). There are translations made from Hebrew,
          Samaritan, Coptic, Latin, Syriac, and Greek. There was not, as
          it seems, a translation into Arabic before Mohammed (cf. M. J.
          de Goeje and M. Schreiner, in Semitic Studies in Memory of
          Alexander Kohut, Berlin, 1897, p. 495). John of Seville is said
          to have produced an Arabic Bible about 737; the chronicle of
          Michael Syrus mentions an Arabic translation of the Gospels made
          under direction of John, patriarch of Antioch, at the command of
          the emir Amru. The "Indians" mentioned by Chrysostom between
          Egyptians and Persians as in possession of the Scriptures in
          their mother tongue may be South-Arabians, but there is no
          additional information about this version.

          Of translations from the Hebrew Old Testament, by far the most
          important is the work of Saadia ben Joseph, the Gaon, from the
          Fayyum (d. 942; see [249]Saadia). On Saadia and his translation,
          cf. H. Ewald and L. Dukes, Beiträge zur Geschichte der ältesten
          Auslegung und Spracherklärung des alten Testaments, ii
          (Stuttgart, 1844); S. Munk, in La Bible, traduction nouvelle
          . . . par S. Cahen, ix (Paris, 1838), 73-159; M. Steinschneider,
          Die arabische Literatur der Juden (Frankfort, 1902), 56 sqq.;
          and especially the edition of his collected works by J. H.
          Derenbourg, vol. i, the Pentateuch (Paris, 1893); iii, Isaiah
          (1896); iv, Proverbs (1899); v, Job (ed. Bacher, 1899). On the
          question of the text, cf. P. Kahle, Die arabischen
          Bibelübersetzungen . . . (Leipsic, 1904), no. viii, and against
          him Bacher, in TLZ, 1905, no. 8. Saadia's translation of the
          Pentateuch was printed first in Hebrew letters with the Hebrew
          text, Targum and a Persian translation at Constantinople, 1546,
          then in the Paris and London Polyglots (see [250]Bibles,
          Polyglot, III, [251]IV). For Genesis and Exodus, cf. Lagarde, in
          his Materialien zur Kritik (Leipsic, 1867). Kahle used for his
          Specimen a manuscript of Florence and Wolfenbüttel, not used by
          Derenbourg. On Isaiah, cf. Derenbourg, in ZATW, 1890, pp. 1-84.
          Of Job there is an edition by J. Cohn (Berlin, 1889). On the
          Psalms, cf. the dissertations of Haneberg in AMA, 1841, iii, 2;
          J. Cohn, in Magazin für die Wissenschaft des Judentums, 1881. On
          Canticles, cf. A. Merx, Die Saadjanische Uebersetzung des Hohen
          Liedes ins Arabische (Heidelberg, 1882). On Proverbs, cf. a
          dissertation of Jonas Bondi (Halle, 1888). On Saadia's system of
          translating, cf. W. Engelkemper, De Saadiæ Gaonis vita,
          bibliorum versione, hermeneutica (Münster, 1897).

          There are other Arabic translations made from the Hebrew by Jews
          such as the Arabe Erpenii, a translation of the Pentateuch made
          by an African Jew in the thirteenth century (published by
          Erpenius, Leyden, 1622), and a translation of the Psalms made by
          the Karaite Japhet ben Eli (ed. J. J. L. Bargès, Paris, 1871); a
          specimen of his commentary on Genesis is in Kahle, viii; his
          commentary on Deuteronomy was edited by S. Margoliouth, in
          Anecdota Ozoniensia, Semitic series, vol. i, part 3, 1899. Hosea
          and Joel from an Oxford manuscript were edited by Schröter, in
          Archiv für wissenschaftliche Erforschung des Alten Testaments, i
          and ii (1869-70). A Fragment einer arabischen
          Pentateuchübersetzung was published by J. Hirsch, Leipsic, 1900.

          The first specimen of an Arabic translation of the Samaritan
          text was published by A. C. Hwiid (Rome, 1780) from the famous
          triglot in the Barberini library; then by Paulus, 1789 and 1791;
          better by de Sacy, in Mémoires de l'Académie des Inscriptions,
          xlix, 1-199; S. Kohn, in Abhandlungen für die Kunde des
          Morgenlandes, vol. v, part 4 (Leipsic, 1876), 1-499; J. Bloch,
          Die samaritanisch-arabische Pentateuchübersetzung (Berlin,
          1901); and Kahle, ut sup., no. vi. The Samaritans seem to have
          used at first the translation of Saadia; soon after 1000 they
          made a translation of their own, which was revised in the middle
          of the thirteenth century by Abu Said; Genesis, Exodus, and
          Leviticus of this version were edited by Kuenen, 1851-54 (cf. A.
          Cowley, in JE, x, 677).

          Many Coptic manuscripts have an Arabic translation by the aide
          of the Coptic text; in other manuscripts containing only an
          Arabic version, this is derived from the Coptic (cf. Arab. 3 in
          the Greek Pentateuch of Holmes-Parsons; see above, [252]I, 1,
          § 2); for Job such a translation has been edited by Lagarde,
          Psalterium, Job, Proverbia arabice (Göttingen, 1876); on Psalms,
          cf. Psalterium Coptice, ed. M. G. Schwartze (Leipsic, 1843), v.

          From the Latin, either made from it or corrected by it, are the
          Roman editions such as that of Sergius Risi (Arabic and Latin, 3
          vols., Rome, 1871), the Gospels (1591), and Psalms and Prophets
          (1814). A new recension by Rafael Tuki contains only
          Genesis-Nehemiah and Tobit (2 vols., 1752). The edition of 1671
          without the Apocrypha has been frequently reprinted by the BFBS
          since 1822 after it had reprinted the Arabic portion of the
          London Polyglot under the supervision of J. D. Carlyle
          (Newcastle, 1811). In 1858 the Gospels, in 1860 the New
          Testament, in 1865 the Old Testament appeared in the new
          translation begun by the American missionary [253]Eli Smith and
          finished by C. V. A. Van Dyck at Beirut, with the help of native
          scholars. It has been frequently reprinted in Beirut, Oxford,
          London, and New York. In competition with this translation are
          two from Roman Catholics, the one undertaken by the Dominicans
          of Mosul under the direction of Joseph David (4 vols., 1875-78),
          the other by the Jesuits in Beirut (3 vols., 1876-82; reproduced
          by photolithography in 1 vol. 1897; cf. on these editions Kahle,
          iii sqq.; A. G. Ellis, Catalogue of Arabic Books in the British
          Museum, London, 1894 sqq.; the Bible Catalogue of the same
          library; and Darlow-Moule, Historical Catalogue of the
          Collection of the BFBS, ii, London, 1908). Independent
          translations of the New Testament are those of Salomo Negri
          (London, 1727) and of Nathanael Sabat (Calcutta, 1816). There is
          also an edition of the Psalms by Negri (London, 1725; cf. G. A.
          Freylinghausen, Memoria Negriana, Halle, 1764).

          From the Syriac Bible is the text of Judges, Ruth, Samuel, I
          Kings i-xi, II Kings ii. 17 to the end, Chronicles, Neh. ix. 28
          to end, and Job in the Paris and London Polyglots. The first
          four books are, according to Rödiger, by the same author, the
          rest by different authors. Psalms, Proverbs, and Job have been
          reissued by Lagarde (Psalterium, etc., ut sup.) and the whole
          with few alterations by the BFBS (1811, ut sup.). A Psalter in
          Syriac and Arabic in Syriac letters (the so-called Karshunic
          script; i.e., Gersom's manner of writing) was printed by
          Maronite monks of Mount Lebanon at Koschaya, 1610 (perhaps as
          early as 1585), and reprinted in Arabic type by Lagarde.
          Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy in the Materialien of
          Lagarde seem to have been derived from the Syriac Bible. A
          translation of the Syriac Hexapla of the Pentateuch and Wisdom
          is the work of Hareth ben Senan ben Sabat (cf. Nestle, in ZDMG,
          1878, p. 468; Holmes-Parsons, Præfatio ad Pentateuchum, and
          Kahle, ut sup., ix). The fragments of Job were edited by
          Baudissin, 1870.

          From the Greek are translated the prophets and the poetical
          books (except Job) in the Polyglots perhaps also the Psalms as
          edited by Athanasius, patriarch of Antioch (Aleppo, 1706),
          reprinted by Lagarde with a translation of the tenth century by
          Abu al-Fath Abdallah ben Fadhl.

          Gregory (Textkritik, Leipsic, 1902) mentions 137 Arabic
          manuscripts for the New Testament. On no. 136, cf. Stenij, Die
          altarabische Uebersetzung der Briefe an die Hebräer, an die
          Römer und an die Korinther (Helsingfors, 1901). For the
          manuscripts on Mount Sinai, cf. the catalogue of Mrs. M. D.
          Gibson, in Studia Sinaitica, iii (Cambridge, 1894), and her
          publication of a part of an Arabic translation of the Epistles
          of St. Paul in no. ii (1893) of the same collection; also in no.
          vii (1899), an Arabic translation of Acts and of the seven
          Catholic Epistles from an eighth or ninth century manuscript. On
          the revision of the Arabic made about 250 at Alexandria by
          Hibath Allah ibn al-Assaly with various readings from the Greek,
          the Syriac, and the Coptic, cf. D. B. Macdonald, in the Hartford
          Seminary Record, Apr., 1893. Finally, the Arabic version of
          Titian's Diatessaron (ed. Ciasca, Rome, 1888) must not be
          forgotten.

  II. Celtic Versions.

          No version of the Bible or of single Biblical books in any of
          the Celtic dialects has come down from the pre-Reformation
          period, though a few Biblical extracts in Old Irish (8th-11th
          centuries) are extant in homilies. After the establishment of
          the English Church in 1560 as the State Church, Bishop Nicholas
          Walsh of Ossory and others made an effort toward giving the
          Bible to the Irish people, and the New Testament, translated by
          William O'Donnell, archbishop of Tuam, was published at Dublin
          in 1603 in Irish characters. This edition was republished at
          London in 1681, and in 1685 the Old Testament, translated by
          Bishop William Bedell of Kilmore and others, was issued. This
          edition was often reprinted, especially in a revised form by the
          British and Foreign Bible Society in 1827. A translation of the
          New Testament into the modern dialect of Munster by Dr. R.
          O'Kane appeared at Dublin, 1858. Of the Roman Catholic
          translation prepared by Archbishop John MacHale of Tuam from the
          Vulgate, the first volume only (Genesis-Joshua) has appeared
          (Tuam, 1861). Gaelic, which is spoken in the Highlands and
          western isles of Scotland, is related to Irish; consequently the
          Scottish Minister Robert Kirke, in order to satisfy the needs of
          the Protestant Highlanders, had O'Donnell's Irish translation of
          the New Testament printed in Roman letters and supplied with an
          Irish-Gaelic glossary (London, 1690). To provide the
          Gaelic-speaking Highlanders with a Bible of their own, the
          Society for the Promotion of Christian Knowledge published in
          1767 the New Testament translated by James Stuart of Killin, and
          in 1783-1801 a translation of the Old Testament prepared by John
          Stuart, Jr., and John Smith. At the instance of the same
          society, Dr. Mark Hildesley, bishop of Man, distributed
          different parts of the Bible among the Manx-speaking clergy of
          the Isle of Man, with the view of having a translation prepared
          into this tongue. The whole was revised by P. Moore and his
          pupil John Kelly. In 1770-72 the Bible in Manx was printed for
          the above society at Whitehaven under the supervision of J.
          Kelly, and is the basis of all later editions.

          Before the Reformation hardly any parts of the Bible were
          translated into Cymric. In 1562 the House of Commons resolved to
          have the Bible and the Book of Common Prayer translated into
          Cymric within four years, and made the bishops of Bangor, St.
          Asaph, Hereford, Llandaff, and St. Davids responsible for its
          execution. The New Testament was published in London in 1567,
          and in 1588 the whole Bible (revised by Bishop Richard Parry,
          1620). All later issues follow Parry's revised text. The Bible
          has never been translated into Cornish. A manuscript belonging
          to the first half of the eighteenth century contains a
          translation of Gen. i, iii; Matt. iv, vi, 9-13, vii; and the ten
          commandments. Before the beginning of the nineteenth century
          only short passages of the Bible had appeared in the Breton. The
          British and Foreign Bible Society published at Angoulême in 1827
          the New Testament translated by the Breton scholar Le Gonidec
          into the dialect of Léon. The translation was made from the
          Vulgate, and was for other reasons unsuitable. A new translation
          by the Baptist missionary John Jenkins was printed at Brest in
          1847. Le Gonidec's translation of the Old Testament was revised
          by Troude and Milin, and published at Saint-Brieuc in 1866. In
          1883 the Trinitarian Bible Society published a New Testament in
          the dialect of Tréguier, prepared by the Breton Protestant G. Ar
          C'hoat, and in 1889 the whole Bible. A Roman Catholic
          translation of the New Testament was published in Guingamp in
          1853, and an edition of the Psalms at Paris in 1873. For
          linguistic purposes C. Terrien translated the Gospel of Matthew
          into the dialect of Vannes (Lundayn, 1857) at the instance of
          Lucien Bonaparte.

  III. Dutch Versions.

          The first printed Dutch version (Delft, 1477), was made,
          apparently by a layman, probably about 1300 from the Latin. Some
          parts, which the translator was unwilling to popularize, as
          Deut. xxii. 13-21, are passed over with a reference to the Latin
          text. Difficult passages have explanations mostly from the
          Historia scholastica of Peter Comestor. The printed edition
          omits Psalms and the New Testament, though both are contained in
          a good manuscript of this version at Vienna. A very good
          translation of the Psalms is found is several incunabula. About
          1,300 translations of the New Testament, or at least of the
          church lessons or of the life of Christ, began to be made. A
          translation of the New Testament of Erasmus appeared at Delft in
          1524, and two years before at Antwerp a translation of Luther's
          version was printed by Hans van Roemundt (repeated at Basel,
          1525 and 1526, also, a little altered, at Amsterdam, 1526). The
          Old Testament with the Pentateuch and Psalms translated from
          Luther, the rest the text of the Delft edition revised, was
          printed, also by Roemundt, in 1525 in four small vols.; and the
          first complete Dutch Bible was printed at Antwerp in 1526 by
          Jacob van Liesveldt. It was reprinted and corrected several
          times until 1546, when Charles V prohibited the edition.

          Roman Catholic editions of the New Testament followed in 1527,
          1530, and 1533, in Dutch and Latin in 1539. The whole Bible did
          not appear until after the meeting of the Council of Trent, at
          Cologne in 1548 by Alexander Blanckart, and at Louvain in the
          same year by Nicolaus van Winghe with a sharp preface against
          the Protestant editions. In 1599 it was revised after the
          official Vulgate of 1592, again in 1717 by Ægidius Wit of Ghent.
          After 1820 the Roman Catholics were allowed to use editions
          without notes, and such an edition of 1599, called the Mörentorf
          Bible (from its publisher), was circulated by the British and
          Foreign Bible Society.

          The division of Dutch Protestantism into various parties,
          Lutherans, Mennonites, and Reformed, caused the production of
          various versions. The Lutherans received a version in 1558 after
          Bugenhagen's edition in Low German; it has been several times
          revised and reprinted up to 1851. The Mennonites used a version
          printed by Nicolaes Biestkens at Emden in 1560, the first Dutch
          edition with verse divisions. The Reformed received another in
          1556, based on the Zurich Bible of 1548-49 (see below, [254]VII,
          § 5); but in 1562 they adopted a version based on Luther's,
          called the Deux Aes or Eulenspiegel Bible (from the marginal
          notes at Neh. ii, 5 and Ecclus. xix, 5). The Remonstrants used
          at first the Staatenbibel (see below) but received a New
          Testament of their own from Hartsoeker in 1680.

          After the beginning of the seventeenth century the necessity of
          improving the Dutch versions was felt and was shown especially
          by W. Baudartius of Zutphen, who published in 1614 an emended
          translation. As early as 1594 the States General determined on
          undertaking a revision. The result is the Staatenbibel. At first
          [255]Philips van Marnix was entrusted with the task of a new
          translation; in 1596 [256]Johannes Drusius was appointed his
          assistant. The Synod of Dort discussed the question in eight
          sessions in Nov., 1618, and May, 1619. The work of translation
          was completed in 1632, the revision of the Old Testament Sept.,
          1634, that of the New Testament, Oct. 10, 1635. The first
          edition was printed, with and without notes, in 1636, but not
          published before July 29, 1637. An official list of misprints
          followed in 1655 and in 1711 for the first time an edition was
          stereotyped. An edition of 500 copies of the New Testament was
          printed for Peter the Great in 1717, and of the Old Testament in
          five parts in 1721, in two columns, one being left blank in
          order to receive in St. Petersburg the Russian text. Language
          and orthography raised difficult questions in a revision of
          1762, and another by Henry Cats and W. A. van Hengel in 1834.
          The first impression for the British and Foreign Bible Society
          was made in 1812.

          About the middle of the last century members of the theological
          faculty of Leyden began a new revision; the New Testament was
          finished in 1866; work on the Old Testament was interrupted for
          a time, but was resumed in 1884 by A. Kuenen and his pupils, H.
          Oort, W. H. Kosters, and J. Hooykas. The first instalment
          appeared at Leyden in 1897, the first part (Gen.-Esther) in
          1900, the second part (Job-Malachi) in 1901.

          Of other translations that by J. H. van der Palm (1825 and
          often) is worthy of mention. The New Testament has been
          translated by G. Vissering, a Mennonite (1854), by S. P. Lipman,
          a Roman Catholic (1861), and by G. J. Vos of the Reformed Church
          (1895).

  IV. English Versions.

    1. The Earliest Versions.

          Setting aside the Biblical poetry that is in the main wrongly
          ascribed to the Anglo-Saxon [257]Cædmon, and the translation of
          John's Gospel which Bede finished on his deathbed, but of which
          nothing further is known, the Psalms seem to have been the first
          part of the Bible to be translated into English. An Anglo-Saxon
          paraphrase is extant containing the first fifty Psalms in prose,
          the rest in verse (ed. B. Thorpe, Oxford 1835), which has been
          incorrectly attributed to [258]Aldhelm, bishop of Sherborne, who
          died in 709, and to King Alfred; the name of the translator is
          not known, but he did his work after 778 and used the Latin, not
          the Greek text, as did all the others down to and including
          Wyclif. A translation of the four Gospels was made probably in
          the ninth century (ed. Matthew Parker, 1571; T. Marshall, 1665;
          B. Thorpe, The halgan Godspel on Englisc. The Anglo-Saxon
          Version of the Holy Gospels, London, 1842; Joseph Bosworth and
          George Waring, The Gothic and Anglo-Saxon Gospels, London, 1865;
          new ed., 1907), and interlinear glosses for the Psalms and the
          Gospels in the ninth and tenth centuries (Psalterium Davidis
          Latino-Saxonicum vetus, London, 1640). The so-called Vespasian
          Gospels probably belong to the first half of the ninth century
          (cf. J. Stevenson, Anglo-Saxon and Early English Psalter, 2
          vols., London, 1843-47; H. Sweet, The Oldest English Texts,
          Early English Text Society, vol. 83, London, 1885, pp. 183-420;
          E. Wende, Ueberlieferung und Sprache der mittelenglischen
          Version des Psalters und ihr Verhältnis zur lateinischen
          Vorlage, Breslau, 1884). There are other similar glosses to the
          Psalter in the libraries of Cambridge University and Trinity
          College, Cambridge, in the British Museum, in the Bodleian at
          Oxford, in Lambeth Palace, and Salisbury Cathedral. For other
          Gospel versions, cf. G. Stevenson and G. Waring, The Lindisfarne
          and Rushworth Gospels (4 vols., Durham and London, 1854-65); K.
          W. Bouterwek, Die vier Evangelien in altnorthumbrischer Sprache
          (Gütersloh, 1857); W. W. Skeat, The Gospel according to Matthew,
          etc. (Cambridge, 1887,--;Mark, 1871; Luke, 1871; John, 1878); A.
          S. Cook, A Glossary of the Old Northumbrian Gospels (Halle,
          1894). [259]Alfric translated the Pentateuch and Joshua in
          997-998. The following may also be mentioned: homilies on the
          lessons by the Augustinian monk Ormin in the twelfth or
          thirteenth century (the so-called Ormulum); the translation of
          the Psalms by William de Shorham, vicar of ChartSutton, near
          Leeds in County Kent, about 1325 (the manuscript in Trinity
          College, Dublin, owned by John Hyde and perhaps written by him,
          may be a revision of this translation); and the commentary with
          a translation of the Psalms by Richard Rolle of Hampole near
          Doncaster, Yorkshire, written about 1330 (cf. H. R. Bramley, The
          Psalter . . . by Richard Rolle . . . Edited from Manuscripts,
          Oxford, 1884; Heinrich Middendorff, Studien über Richard Rolle
          von Hampole, Magdeburg, 1888).

    2. Wyclif.

          The language developed and the thoughts of men strode onward.
          [260]John Wyclif entered the lists to war for the pure truth,
          and he determined to give the people the Bible. With the help of
          his pupil [261]Nicholas of Hereford he seems to have translated
          the whole Bible, and when he was charged with heresy and driven
          from Oxford in 1382, he withdrew to Lutterworth and revised the
          whole very carefully. His pupil [262]John Purvey appears also to
          have revised some things in the Old Testament; he did all he
          could to spread the translation abroad after Wyclif's death (cf.
          The New Testament in English, Translated by John Wyclif circa
          1380, now first printed from a contemporary manuscript. . . .
          Printed at Chiswick by Charles Whittingham for William
          Pickering, London, 1848; Josiah Forshall and Frederic Madden,
          The Holy Bible . . . in the Earliest English Versions Made . . .
          by John Wycliffe and his Followers, 4 vols., Oxford, 1850, with
          a list of 170 manuscripts; J. ten Brink, Geschichte der
          englischen Litteratur, vol. ii, by Alois Brandl, Strasburg,
          1893, pp. 5-32, especially pp. 27; A. Richter, Das Wycliffesche
          Evangelium Johannis im 500. Bde. der Tauchnitzer Collection of
          British Authors, die Wycliffesche Bibelübersetzung, und das
          Verhältnis des ersteren zu der letzteren, programme of the
          gymnasium at Wesel, Aug. 30, 1862). The first English Bible, the
          first Bible at all in a modern tongue, was well received by the
          people, but for a century and a half was the object of attack by
          Priests and nobility. Even long after the discovery of printing
          no one could think of publishing this translation. It finally
          came out as a literary necessity in 1731, edited by J. Lewis
          (reprinted by H. H. Baber, London, 1810, and by Batter, London,
          1841; the edition of 1848 is named above). For another version
          of this period consult the work of a Swedish lady, Anna C.
          Paues, A Fourteenth Century English Biblical Version (Cambridge,
          1904).

    3. Tyndale.

          The first to translate the New Testament in English from the
          original Greek was [263]William Tyndale. He printed Matthew and
          Mark first, somewhere on the Continent, in 1524 and 1525, and
          then the whole New Testament in quarto, partly at Cologne at
          Peter Quentel's before 1526, partly, it seems, at Worms (at
          Peter Schöffer's?) in 3,000 copies, and in octavo at Cologne at
          Schöffer's in 3,000 copies. Both editions were in England by
          about March, 1526 (cf. The First Printed English New Testament
          Translated by William Tyndale. Photolithographed. . . . Edited
          by E. Arber, London, 1871; The First New Testament Printed in
          the English Language . . . by William Tyndale. Reproduced in
          facsimile . . . by F. Fry, Bristol, 1862; James Loring Cheney,
          The Sources of Tyndale's New Testament, Halle, 1883, especially
          pp. 39, 40; W. Sopp, Orthographie und Aussprache der ersten
          neuenglischen Bibelübersetzurtg von William Tyndale, Marburg,
          1889). The hierarchy attacked Tyndale's work violently. The
          first public burning of the volume appears to have taken place
          in the autumn of 1526. [264]William Warham, archbishop of
          Canterbury, thought in May, 1527, that his agents had bought up
          all the copies of all three editions. In 1528 the readers of the
          New Testament had to take their turn at being burned. Tyndale
          published the Pentateuch Jan. 17, 1530 (see [265]Tyndale,
          William), Joshua in 1531.

    4. Coverdale. Other Editions.

          William Roye, George Joye (afterward a bitter enemy), [266]Miles
          Coverdale, [267]John Rogers, and [268]John Frith were among the
          friends who from time to time worked with Tyndale. Coverdale
          completed at Antwerp, Oct. 4, 1535, the printing of his
          translation of the whole Bible "out of Douche acid Latyn" (i.e.
          the German of Luther and the Zurich Bible of 1524-29--see below,
          [269]VII, § 5--and the Vulgate), using also Tyndale's work. This
          was the first complete Bible in English; in it the non-canonical
          books of the Old Testament are in an appendix by themselves,
          named "Hagiographa." In 1537 the "Matthew" Bible came out, a
          speculation on the part of the king's printer, although most of
          it was perhaps printed in Antwerp; it was a combination of
          Tyndale and Coverdale, made by John Rogers (alias Matthew) in
          Antwerp. In 1539 appeared the "Taverner" Bible, a revision of
          the Matthew Bible by [270]Richard Taverner. The "Great" Bible
          was brought out by Cromwell, Earl of Essex, [271]Thomas Cranmer,
          and [272]Thomas More, and a committee of prelates and scholars,
          and was printed under Coverdale's supervision, partly at Paris,
          till the Inquisitor-General attacked it Dec. 17, 1538, and then
          in London, where the volume was finished in Apr., 1539; the
          second edition ("Cranmer's" Bible, 1540) was "apoynted to the
          vse of the churches"; the Psalter from this Bible still stands
          in the prayer-book of the English Church. In 1557 William
          Whittingham published at Geneva an English New Testament with
          Stephens's verse-division of 1551 (see [273]Bible Text, III,
          §§ 2-3) and with many corrections of the translation. In 1558
          Coverdale began in Geneva a new Bible, but returned to England
          in 1559, while Whittingham, Anthony Gilby, and Thomas Sampson
          finished the printing of the handsome edition known as the
          "Geneva" Bible in Apr., 1560. [274]Archbishop Parker with eleven
          bishops and four minor prelates began in 1583 a revision of the
          edition of 1539, which was completed Oct. 5, 1568, as the
          "Bishops'" Bible; but it was not especially liked; in the
          churches they used chiefly the Bible of 1539 and at home the
          Geneva Bible. See [275]Bibles, Annotated, and Bible Summaries,
          II, §§ 1-2.

    5. The Douai Bible.

          The Roman Catholic fugitives on the Continent now prepared an
          English version and published the New Testament at Reims in
          1582; the Old Testament followed in two volumes at [276]Douai in
          1609-10 (the first edition of the "Douai" Bible; cf. Gregory
          Martin, A Discoverie of the Manifold Corruptions of the Holie
          Scriptures by the Heretikes of our Daies, etc., Reims, 1582;
          William Fulke, A Defence of the Sincere and True Translations of
          the Holie Scriptures . . . against . . . Gregorie Martin,
          London, 1583, ed. C. H. Hartshorne for the Parker Society,
          Cambridge, 1843). [Both works profess to be "faithfully
          translated out of the authentical Latin, diligently conferred
          with the Hebrew, Greek, and other editions in divers languages,"
          and are provided with arguments of books and chapters,
          annotations, and "other helps for the better understanding of
          the text, and specially for the discovery of the corruptions of
          divers late translations, and for clearing the controversies in
          religion of these days." The New Testament was reprinted at
          Antwerp in 1600; the two Testaments were united by [277]Richard
          Challoner in a five volume edition published in London, 1749-50.
          The version was promoted by [278]Cardinal William Allen and the
          translation was by Gregory Martin, a former fellow of St. John's
          College, Oxford, revised by Allen, Richard Bristow, fellow of
          Exeter College, Oxford, and probably others. The annotations,
          tables, etc., for the Old Testament were by Thomas Worthington,
          a graduate of Oxford (Brasenose College) and president of Douai
          College 1599-1613. The long interval between the publication of
          the two Testaments was due to lack of means as the translation
          of both was completed before 1582. The English of the
          translation is faulty owing to too close following of the
          Vulgate, and from the critical standpoint it possesses the
          advantages and defects inherent in that Latin version. An
          elaborate preface of more than twenty pages explains and
          justifies the translation. The notes are characterized by the
          controversial spirit of the time in which they were produced.
          The Douai version became the standard Bible of the English Roman
          Catholics and, with extensive changes in language and
          orthography introduced in Challoner's various editions (see
          [279]Challoner, Richard), still remains such. American editions
          were published in New York in 1854 and 1861. Consult Henry
          Cotton, Rhemes and Doway (Oxford, 1855); F. E. C. Gigot (Roman
          Catholic), General Introduction to the Study of the Scriptures
          (New York, 1900), pp. 345 sqq.]

    6. The Authorized Version.

          Puritan dissatisfaction with existing versions, or perhaps with
          the existence of another version than the one used and approved
          by themselves, was urged by [280]John Reynolds, head of Corpus
          Christi College, Oxford, at the [281]Hampton Court Conference in
          Jan., 1604. The idea of a new Bible translation, to be made
          ostensibly at his instance and under his direction, was
          congenial to James I. By the summer of 1604 the preliminaries
          were completed. A commission of six "companies," each of nine
          scholars (two companies each in Westminster, Oxford, and
          Cambridge; actually forty-seven members took part; for names of
          the translators, the division of the work, and much other
          information about the Authorized Version in convenient form, cf.
          Mombert's Hand Book, chap. xiii; Schaff's Companion, chap. vii),
          was appointed by James and very strict rules were laid down for
          the work. After years of labor (although some say that the work
          really began only in 1607 and lasted but two years and a half),
          during which some passages were wrought over fourteen or even
          seventeen times, the version appeared in 1611 in two folio
          editions, set up and printed at the same time so as to have a
          large number of copies very quickly; in the same year a
          duodecimo edition came out, of which only one copy (in the Lenox
          Library, New York City) is said to be known, and in 1613 what is
          called the second folio edition. The translation was then called
          "The Authorized Version" (although it does not appear ever to
          have been "authorized") or "King James's Version," and the title
          read "Appointed to be read in Churches." The translation was
          good, clear, dignified, idiomatic, and suited to the people. Of
          course, like everything new, it was at first and for a long time
          sharply attacked, but little by little it made its way, and in
          1661 the Epistles and Gospels in the English prayer-book were
          changed to this translation. F. H. A. Scrivener published a
          critical edition of this version: The Cambridge Paragraph Bible
          of the Authorized English Version, etc. (Cambridge, 1873), in
          which he compared many of the reprints, as well as the revisions
          of Dr. Paris in 1762, Dr. Blayney in 1769, and of the American
          Bible Society in 1867; unfortunately Scrivener does not give the
          exact text of 1611 or of 1613.

    7. The Revised Version.

          On Feb. 10, 1870, on motion of [282]Samuel Wilberforce, bishop
          of Winchester, the Convocation of Canterbury determined upon a
          revision of the Authorized Version (cf. Mombert, Hand Book,
          chap. xiv; Schaff, Companion, chap. viii). About thirty-seven
          scholars were asked to take up the Old Testament, and about
          twenty-nine the New Testament, although the number really
          working at any time was less. At least five religious bodies
          besides the Church of England shared in the work. In like manner
          two groups of scholars from nine different religious bodies took
          up the work in America and the results of the deliberations were
          exchanged across the sea. The Greek text of the New Testament
          (cf. The Greek Testament with the Readings Adopted by the
          Revisers of the Authorized Version, Oxford, 1881) was thoroughly
          worked over and the translation made on the basis of the result
          compared with the translation of 1611, and in every detail filed
          and polished. The revised New Testament was published in England
          May 17, 1881, and in America, May 20, 1881; the Old Testament
          appeared May 19, 1885. Three million copies of the New Testament
          were sold within a year. The reception, especially in England,
          was at first, as was to be expected, not very friendly. A very
          few indeed were dissatisfied because too few alterations had
          been made. The great mass struggled against the change of old
          familiar words and found support in one scholar or another. Some
          conservative scholars condemned the English dress while they
          approved the changes made in the original text, and others took
          offense at the new readings in the original text, because they
          considered the common readings sacred. America had a peculiar
          reason for complaint, seeing that many an expression which
          American scholars had preferred was to be found only in the
          appendix, and they were bound not to issue a new edition within
          fourteen years. That time was up in 1896, and the American
          edition, a model of exact work, appeared in New York in 1901. As
          the years pass the revision gains friends, and gains them more
          rapidly than did the revision of 1611.

          S. R. Driver, A. Goodwin, and W. Sanday (London, 1880;
          republished, 1882, as The Variorum Teacher's Bible). The
          American Bible Union, formed in 1850 (see [285]Bible Societies,
          III, 2), undertook an English version which should reflect
          Baptist views in the language used, and published the N. T. (2d
          revision, New York and London, 1869) and certain books of the O.
          T. Since 1882 the work has been continued by the American
          Baptist Publication Society of Philadelphia, and is now nearing
          completion. Among the scholars who have collaborated in this
          version are John A. Broadus, T. J. Conant, H. B. Hackett,
          William R. Harper, Alvah Hovey, A. C. Kendrick, Ira M. Price, J.
          R. Sampey, and B. C. Taylor. A present day tendency is
          represented by The Bible in Modern English, translated direct
          from the original languages by Ferrar Fenton, with critical
          introduction and notes (St. Paul's epistles, London, 1894; N. T.
          complete, 1895; O. T., 1903).

          The following are by Roman Catholics: John Caryll, a layman,
          secretary to the queen of James II end intimately associated
          with the family of James, the Psalms (St. Germains, 1700; a
          prose version from the Vulgate taking Bellarmine as a guide);
          Cornelius Nary, pariah priest of St. Michan's, Dublin, The N. T.
          . . newly Translated out of the Latin Vulgate Dublin, 1718; has
          annotations and notes); Robert Witham, president at Douai,
          Annotations on the N. T. (2 vols., Douai, 1730; explains the
          "literal sense," "examines and disproves" false interpretations,
          and gives "an account of the chief differences betwixt the text
          of the ancient Latin version and the Greek"); "Troy's Bible"
          (Dublin, 1791; ed. the Rev. Bernard MacMahon, who had already
          edited three annotated editions of the Reims N. T.; this Bible
          is annotated and the text of the N. T. differs considerably from
          Challoner; the name comes from J. T. Troy, titular archbishop of
          Dublin, who approved the work); Alexander Geddes, Genesis--II
          Chronicles and the Prayer of Manasses (2 vols., London,

          the Greek). The work of Bishop Challoner has been referred to
          above (§ 5).

    9. Rare and Curious Editions.

          The following are certain rare and curious editions of the
          English Bible with the passage or fact which gives to each its
          name. The Breeches Bible: the Geneva Bible of 1560 Gen. iii, 7
          reads "They sewed fig leaves together and made themselves
          breeches" (also in Wyclif); the Bug Bible: an edition of the
          Matthew Bible in 1551; Ps. xci, 5 reads "So that thou shall not
          nede to be afraid for any bugges [i.e., bogies] by night" (also
          in Coverdale and Taverner) the Caxton Memorial Bible: Oxford,
          1877, printed and bound in 100 copies in twelve hours; the
          Discharge Bible: London, 1802; I Tim. v, 21 "I discharge [for
          charge] thee before God"; the Ears to Ear Bible: Oxford, 1807;
          Matt. xiii, 43, "Who hath ears to ear" (also has "good works"
          for "dead works" in Heb. ix, 14); the Goose Bible: Dort editions
          of the Geneva Bible because the Dort press had a goose as its
          emblem; the He and She Bibles: the first and the second folio
          editions of the version of 1611; in Ruth iii, 15, the former
          reads "He measured six measures of barley and laid it on her:
          and he went into the city"; the latter "and she went into the
          city"; both issues were used by printers as copy until in and
          after 1814 all have "she" (cf. the Revised Version, text and
          margin); the Leda Bible: the first Bishops' Bible (1568); it
          used a series of initial letters prepared for Ovid's
          Metamorphoses and that for the Epistle to the Hebrews
          represented Leda and the swan (also called the Treacle Bible,
          see below); the Murderers' Bible: has "murderers" for
          "murmurers" in Jude 16, also other misprints; the Placemakers'
          Bible: the second edition of the Geneva Bible (1562); has
          "placemakers" for "peacemakers " in Matt. v, 9; the Rebekah
          Bible: London, 1823; Gen. xxiv, 61, "And Rebekah arose and her
          camels" (for "damsels"); the Rosin Bible: the first Douai Bible
          (1609-10): Jer. viii, 22 "Is there no rosin in Gilead?" (A. V.
          "balm"); the Standing Fishes Bible: London, 1806; Ezek. xlvii,
          10 "The fishes [for fishers] shall stand upon it"; (the error
          was repeated in editions of 1813 and 1823); the Thumb Bible:
          Aberdeen, 1670; it is about one inch square and half an inch
          thick; the To Remain Bible: Cambridge, 1805; Gal. iv, 29,
          "Persecuted him that was born after the Spirit to remain even so
          it is now" (the words "to remain" has been written on the proof
          in answer to a query whether or not a comma should be deleted;
          the error was retained in an edition printed for the Bible
          Society in 1805-06 and in an edition of 1819); the Treacle
          Bible: the first Bishops Bible (1568; also called the Leda
          Bible, see above); Jer. viii, 22, "Is there no tryacle in
          Gilead" (cf. the Rosin Bible); the Vinegar Bible: Oxford,
          1716-17; has "vinegar" for "vineyard" as the heading to Luke xx
          (it was printed by J. Baskett, and though the most sumptuous of
          the Oxford Bibles, soon came to be styled "a basketful of
          printer's errors"); the Wicked Bible: London, 1631; the negative
          was left out of the seventh commandment (it was printed by the
          king's printer and there were four editions in the same year;
          all were suppressed and the printer was fined £300); another
          Wicked Bible (London, 1653) makes Paul ask, I Cor. vi, 9, "Know
          ye not that the unrighteous shall inherit the kingdom of God?"
          the Wife-Hater Bible: Oxford, 1810; Luke xiv, 26, "If any man
          come to me and hate not his father . . . yea, and his own wife
          [for life] also, be can not be my disciple." The list of
          misprints might be greatly extended. A Cambridge Bible of 1829,
          printed and proof-read with great care, introduced "thy
          doctrine" for "the doctrine" in I Tim. iv, 18, and the error
          reappeared for many years. An Edinburgh octavo of 1837 has; Jer.
          iv, 17, " because she hath been religious [rebellious] against
          me." Perhaps the finest Bible ever printed at Cambridge (1638)
          has a famous error in Acts vi, 3, which is said to have cost
          Cromwell £1,000 as a bribe--"whom ye [for we] may appoint."
          Cotton Mather relates that a Bible printed before 1702 made
          David complain in Ps. cxix, 161, "Printers [princes] have
          persecuted me without a cause." The "wicked" Bible of 1631 does
          not furnish the only instance of an infelicitous omission of a
          negative; an Edinburgh Bible of 1760 reads, Heb. ii, 18, "He
          took on him the nature of angels" (correct reading "he took
          not"); another (Edinburgh, 1818) has, Luke vi, 29, "Forbid [not]
          to take thy coat also"; and a London Bible of 1817 reads, John
          xvii, 25, "O righteous Father, the world hath [not] known thee."
          On the other hand an Edinburgh edition of 1781 makes the
          Psalmist's prayer (cxix, 35) "Make me not to go in the path of
          thy commandments." The errors of an Oxford Bible of 1804
          include, Num. xxxv, 18, "The murderer shall surely be put
          together" (for "to death"), I Kings viii, 19, "out of thy lions
          [loins]," and, Gal, v, 17, "For the flesh lusteth after
          [against] the Spirit." A Cambridge Bible of 1819 reads in Mal.
          iv, 2, " shall the son [sun] of righteousness arise . . . and
          shall [for ye shall] go forth." An Oxford Bible of 1820 has,
          Isa. lxvi, 9, "Shall I bring to the birth and not cease [cause]
          to bring forth?" A Cambridge Bible of 1826 has "heart" for
          "hart" in Ps. xlii. 1, and the error was repeated in an edition
          of 1830. A Bible printed at Utica, N. Y., in 1829 begins Jas. v,
          17, "Elias was a man possible like unto us" ("subject to like
          passions as we are"). One of Jesper Harding's early editions,
          published at Philadelphia, has in I Kings i, 21, "The king shall
          dagger sleep with his fathers" (the copy read "The king shall
          sleep with his fathers"). A Bible published at Hartford in 1837
          makes II Tim. iii, 18, read, "All scripture is given by
          inspiration of God, and is profitable . . . for destruction
          [instruction] in righteousness." An edition printed for the
          American Bible Society in 1855 has in Mark v, 3, "Who had his
          dwelling among the lambs [tombs]." The Great Bible in 1539
          introduced the mistranslation "fold" for "flock" in John x, 16,
          and it was not corrected till the Revised Version. Some of the
          renderings in the early versions are extremely quaint. In Gen.
          xxxix, 2, Tyndale has, "And the Lord was with Joseph and he was
          a lucky fellow," and in Matt. vi, 7, "When ye pray, babble not
          much." Coverdale renders Judges xv, 9, "Then God opened a gome
          tooth in the cheke bone so the water went out," and I Kings
          xxii, 34, "Shott the King of Israel between the mawe and the
          lunges."

          English-speaking Jews have used freely the Authorized Version,
          also, since its appearance in 1885, the revised Old Testament.
          The Jewish School and Family Bible (4 parts, London, 1851-61)
          has a new translation by A. Benisch, and The Jewish Family Bible
          (London, 1884) has a revision of the Authorized Version by M.
          Friedländer; the latter was sanctioned by the chief rabbi of the
          British Jews. Isaac Leeser, a pioneer Jewish rabbi and founder
          of the Jewish press in America, published a translation of the
          complete Old Testament at Philadelphia in 1854, giving
          practically new versions of the Prophets, Psalms, and Job and
          following the Authorized Version in other parts. In 1898 the
          Jewish Publication Society of America (Philadelphia) took in
          hand the preparation of a complete revision, with M. Jastrow,
          Sr., as editor-in-chief and K. Kohler and F. de Sola Mendes as
          associate editors. In 1905 Dr. Kohler's translation of the
          Psalms was issued (cf. the JE, iii, 194-195).

          Bibliography: The most complete view of the literature on the
          subject is given in S. G. Ayres and C. F. Sitterly, The History
          of the Eng. Bible, New York, 1898 (a bibliography almost
          exhaustive, arranged in rubrics). The most complete account up
          to the time of its publication is J. Eadie, The Eng. Bible, an

  V. Finnish and Lappish Versions.

          Although Swedish was formerly the principal language of Finland,
          which remained a Swedish province till the year 1809, during the
          period of the Reformation the land acquired a Finnish
          ecclesiastical language. A young Finn, Michael Agricola (see
          [287]Finland, § 2) became acquainted with Luther at Wittenberg.
          Having returned to his native land in 1539, he began to
          translate religious books into Finnish. His translation of the
          New Testament was published first in 1548; the Psalms and some
          of the Prophetical books in 1551-52. In 1642 the entire Bible in
          Finnish by E. Petræus, M. Stadius, H. Hofman, and G. Favorin was
          published in Stockholm, Finland having at that time no printing
          establishment. There were new editions in 1683-85 by H.
          Florinus, and in 1758 by A. Litzelius; a new translation by A.
          V. Ingman appeared in 1859.

          The Lappish and Finnish languages are cognates, the former
          having several dialects. The [288]Lapps were nominally
          Christians early in the Middle Ages, but had little real
          knowledge of Christianity. [289]Thomas von Westen did much for
          Christian instruction among them during the years 1714-23. Some
          Christian works were published in Lappish; parts of the Bible
          were translated and sent to Copenhagen, where they were
          destroyed by a fire. The Norwegian Bible Society having resolved
          in 1821 to publish a Lappish translation of the Bible, Provost
          Kildahl offered his services in 1822 in conjunction with a
          teacher named Gundersen. Kildahl died the same year, but the
          work was continued by Gundersen and later by Niels Stockfleth.
          The first two Gospels were printed in 1838, and the complete New
          Testament in 1840 (new eds.1850 and, revised, 1874). Stockfleth
          translated also parts of the Pentateuch (1840), and the Psalms
          (1854). A Lapp, Lars Hätta, translated the whole Old Testament,
          which, after being revised by Prof. J. A. Friis and
          Seminary-Director Quigstad in Tromsö, was printed in 1875. All
          these are in the Norwegian-Lapp dialect.

          In the Swedish-Lapp dialect a handbook containing the lessons
          from the Gospels and the Epistles for the church-year, the
          Psalms, Proverbs, and Ecclesiasticus was published by J. J.
          Tornäus at Stockholm in 1648. The New Testament was translated
          by Per Fjellström and published in 1755; a new edition and also
          the entire Bible was issued at Hernösand in 1811.

  VI. French Versions.

    1. The Earlier Versions.

          The beginnings of a French Bible may be traced at least to the
          early twelfth century. In all probability pupils of Lanfranc (d.
          1089) translated the Psalter for the first time into the
          French-Norman vernacular. At that time there was scarcely any
          difference between the Norman and the French (i.e. the dialect
          used in the Île-de-France, a province having Paris as its
          capital). The Psalter, together with the canticles used in the
          Church, was offered to the French-speaking people in a double
          form; viz., (1) after the Psalterium Hebraicum, i.e. the Psalter
          translated by Jerome directly from the Hebrew (cf. Le Livre des
          Psaumes, ed. from Cambridge and Paris manuscripts, F. Michel,
          Paris, 1876); (2) after the Psalterium Gallicanum, i.e.
          according to the Psalter carefully revised by Jerome from the
          Septuagint (cf. Libri Psalmorum versio antiqua Gallica, ed. F.
          Michel, Oxford, 1860; see above [290]A, II, 2, § 2). These
          translations were made word for word, and are interlinear, the
          Latin text standing between the lines of the French. The
          translations from the Gallican Psalter were so well received
          that down to the Reformation no one ventured on a new rendering.
          The manuscripts of the French Psalter which are still extant,
          more than 100 in number, without an exception go back to the old
          Norman Psalter.

          About fifty years later Revelation was translated into French in
          the Norman provinces; also Samuel and Kings (cf. Les Quatre
          Livres des Rois, publiés par le Roux de Lincy, Paris, 1842). In
          the twelfth and thirteenth centuries numerous translations
          originated (cf. G. Paris, La Littérature française au moyen âge,
          Paris, 1890, § 136; J. Bonnard, Les Traductions de la Bible en
          vers français, Paris, 1884). Toward 1170 Peter Waldo, the head
          of the Poor Men of Lyons, better known later as the
          [291]Waldenses, brought out translations of several parts of the
          Bible into the vernacular, which had been made by Lyonnaise
          priests at his expense, and Pope Innocent III did not rest till
          these suspicious writings were everywhere suppressed by the
          Inquisition. Nevertheless some remnants of this old Waldensian
          literature have been saved from the hands of the inquisitors at
          Metz and Liége.

    2. Guyard des Moulins.

          Of the versions which have been printed, and of which it is
          possible to give some account, mention may be made of that of
          Guyard des Moulins, canon of St. Peter's at Aire in Artois, on
          the borders of Flanders. Taking the Historia scholastica of
          [292]Peter Comestor, composed in 1170 and containing a digest of
          the Bible history with glosses, he made a free translation of it
          between 1291 and 1295; added a sketch of the history of Job,
          Proverbs, and probably the other books ascribed to Solomon;
          substituted for Comestor's history of the Maccabees a
          translation of Maccabees from the Vulgate; and in general made
          the whole conform more closely to the text of the Vulgate than
          Comestor had done. Psalms, the Prophets, and the Epistles and
          Revelation were not in the work as first issued, and it is
          uncertain whether Acts was not also omitted; they were added,
          however, in later issues. These parts, brought together,
          received the name Biblium historiale (Bible historiale; see
          [293]Bibles, Historical), and it was printed and reprinted in
          great numbers. An edition completed by different hands and
          making thus the first complete Bible, was issued by order of
          Charles VIII about 1487, edited by the king's confessor, Jean de
          Rely, and printed by Vérard in Paris. Twelve editions of this
          appeared between 1487 and 1545. This is called La Grande Bible
          to distinguish it from a work entitled La Bible pour les simples
          gens, a summary of the history of the Old Testament, of which
          five editions, four undated, one dated 1535, have been examined.
          Previous to the edition of 1487, an edition of the New Testament
          of the same translation as that found in the supplemented work
          of Guyard, but not by Guyard himself, was printed at Lyons by
          Bartolomée Buyer, edited by two Augustinian monks, Julien Macho
          and Pierre Farget. It is undated, but is referred to the year
          1477, and justly claims to be the editio princeps of the French
          Scriptures.

    3. Protestant Versions.

          In the year 1523 there appeared at Paris, from the press of
          Simon de Colinea, an anonymous translation of the New Testament
          (often reprinted), to which was added in the same year the
          Psalter and, in 1528, the rest of the Old Testament, issued at
          Antwerp in consequence of attempts on the part of the French
          clergy to suppress the book. There can be no doubt that the
          well-known humanist Jacques Lefèvre d'Étaples (see [294]Faber
          Stapulensis) was the author of this version. The complete work
          appeared in one volume at Antwerp, 1530. It was placed on the
          papal Index in 1546; but in 1550 it was reissued at Louvain,
          edited by two priests, Nicolas de Leuze and François van Larben,
          who revised the work, striking out all that savored of heresy.
          The first Protestant version was prepared by [295]Pierre Robert
          Olivetan within the space of one year, and printed in 1535 by
          Pierre de Wingle at Serrières, near Neuchâtel, in Switzerland,
          at the expense of the Waldensians. It was reprinted several
          times, in one case with a few emendations from the pen of
          Calvin, in 1545. The Roman critics had denounced Olivetan's work
          as of little value because of his supposed ignorance of the
          languages. But he really knew and used the Hebrew to advantage,
          and the Old Testament was quite well done; but either through
          press of time or less accurate knowledge of Greek, the New
          Testament was inferior. To remedy the defects of Olivetan's
          version, the "venerable company" of pastors of Geneva undertook
          a revision of the work and was assisted by Beza, Simon Goulart,
          Antoine Fay, and others. The editor was Bonaventure Corneille
          Bertram, who gives an account of his work in the Lucubrationes
          Franktallenses (in Pearson's Critici Sacri, vol. viii). This
          revised edition appeared in 1588. In this as well as in the
          following editions the divine name Yahweh was translated by
          l'Éternel and this rendering is retained to this day in the
          Protestant Bible of France.

          During the seventeenth century this revision of Olivetan's
          version, known as the "Geneva Bible," was again revised by
          different ministers; the editions of G. Diodati (Geneva, 1644),
          Samuel Des Marets (Amsterdam, 1669), and David Martin (New
          Testament, Utrecht, 1696; whole Bible, 1707) are the first of
          such revisions. Martin's Bible was again revised by the Basel
          minister Pierre Roques (1744), and is to this day disseminated
          by Bible Societies along with other editions. Twenty years
          before Roques published Martin's revised text, [296]J. F.
          Osterwald, a pastor at Neuchâtel, published anew the Geneva
          Bible in 1724, and another and revised edition in 1744, in which
          he embodied the results of the exegetical science of the time.
          As Osterwald's translation became the standard version, it was
          adopted by the British and Foreign Bible Society and issued from
          time to time. A thoroughly revised version prepared by M.
          Fossard and other French pastors was published by the French
          Bible Society in 1887, and this revised text was then adopted by
          the British and Foreign Bible Society.

          The following are other Protestant versions: S. Chastillon
          (Castalio), complete Bible (2 vols., Basel, 1555); J. Le Clerc
          (Clericus), N. T. (Amsterdam, 1703); I. de Beausobre and J.
          Lenfant, N. T. (Amsterdam, 1718; often reprinted in Germany and
          Switzerland); Charles Le Céne, Bible (Amsterdam, 1741); H. A.
          Perret-Gentil, professor at Neuchâtel, O. T. (Neuchâtel, 1847
          sqq.); E. Arnaud, N. T. (Toulouse, 1858); A. Rilliet, N. T.
          (Geneva, 1859); M. J. H. Oltramare, N. T. (Geneva, 1872); Louis
          Segond, O. T. (Geneva, 1874), N. T. (1879), whose work has been
          printed by the Oxford University press; E. Stapfer, N. T.
          (Paris, 1889).

    4. Roman Catholic Versions.

          Of versions by Roman Catholics, the most important are a
          translation of the New Testament published anonymously (Trévoux,
          1702), but ascribed with correctness to [297]Richard Simon, and
          a series of versions which proceeded from Port Royal and the
          Jansenists. As early as the middle of the seventeenth century,
          [298]Antoine Godeau published a translation of the Bible, at
          first in parts, then as a whole. In 1687 the New Testament
          followed, printed by the Elzevirs at Amsterdam, for a bookseller
          of Mons, whence it is often called the Mons Testament. The
          translators were Antoine and Louis Isaac Lemaistre de Sacy (see
          [299]Lemaistre de Sacy, Louis Isaac), aided by Antoine Arnauld,
          Pierre Nicole, Claude de Sainte-Marthe, and Thomas du Fossé. The
          Old Testament, translated by Louis Isaac Lemaistre de Sacy, was
          added later (1671), and the New Testament by [300]Pasquier
          Quesnel appeared in 1687. These translations exercised great
          influence, partly on account of the elegance of the language,
          partly on account of the notes, which served devotional
          purposes. Their method is not a literal rendering, but is
          paraphrastic. The translation of the New Testament generally
          known as that of De Sacy was often republished, and is still
          widely used in France, being circulated by the British and
          Foreign Bible Society.

          [301]René Benoist published a translation of the Bible in 1566.
          Jacques Corbin, an advocate of Paris, presented the Vulgate in a
          translation more Latin than French in 1643. The Latin New
          Testament of Erasmus was translated into French by Michel de
          Marolles, abbé of Villeloin (1649), who also published a version
          of the Psalms (1644). Denys Amelote, a priest of the Oratory,
          translated the New Testament Vulgate into very good French
          (1666). Dominique Bouhours, a Jesuit, also issued a French New
          Testament (1697). In the eighteenth century C. Huré (1702),
          Augustin Calmet (1707), N. Le Gros (1739), and others made
          versions, all more or less dependent on the Vulgate. In more
          recent times the Psalms and Job have been often translated. The
          entire Bible by E. Genoude (Paris, 1821 sqq.) had great success.
          The Gospels by Lamennais (Paris, 1846) are a model of style, but
          because of the notes are really a socialistic polemic. [Other
          names and works which may be mentioned are: M. Orsini, La Bible
          des familles catholiques (Paris, 1851); H. F. Delaunay, who
          translated the annotated Bible of [302]J. F. Allioli into French
          (5 vols., Paris, 1856); J. A. Gaume, Le Nouveau Testament (2
          vols., Paris, 1863); M. A. Bayle, who furnished the translation
          for Paul Drach's annotated Bible(Paris, 1869 sqq.); P. Giguet,
          who translated the Septuagint (4 vols., Paris, 1872); H.
          Lasserre, Les Saints Évangiles (Paris, 1887); the Abbé Boisson
          (Paris, 1901); the Abbé Glaire, who furnished the French
          translation for the polyglot Bible of F. Vigouroux (Paris, 1898
          sqq.); and the Abbé Crampon, La Sainte Bible, revised by the
          Jesuit fathers with the collaboration of the professors of St.
          Sulpice (Paris, 1907).]

          Translations of the Old Testament by Jews are found in S.
          Cahen's annotated Bible (18 vols., Paris, 1831-51) [and in the
          Old Testament translated under the direction of Zadoc Kahn,
          chief rabbi of France (1901 sqq.)].

  VII. German Versions.

    1. Old German Fragments.

          After the Gothic version of Ulfilas (see above, A, X), the
          oldest fragment of the Bible in a Germanic tongue is probably
          the Matthew of Monsee, of the year 738 (twenty-two leaves are in
          Vienna, two in Hanover; on the left page is the Latin, on the
          right German), a Bavarian working over of a Frankish or Alsacian
          original. The best edition is A. Hench, The Monsee Fragments
          newly Collated, with Text, Introduction, Notes, Grammatical
          Treatise, and Exhaustive Glossary and Facsimile (Strasburg,
          1890). The "German Tatian," of which the chief manuscript is at
          St. Gall (second half of the ninth century, in two columns, left
          in Latin, right in German), originated about 830 in Fulda. The
          Latin rests upon a manuscript written about 540 for [303]Bishop
          Victor of Capua, which is still preserved in Fulda, and the
          German follows the Latin very closely (best edition by E.
          Sievers, Tatianus. Lateinisch und Altdeutsch, Paderborn, 1874,
          2d ed., 1892). Heccard, count of Burgundy, in 876 gave as a
          present an Evangelium Theudiscum with other books (cf. P. Lejay,
          in Revue des Bibliothèques, July-Sept., 1896). Walton, in his
          Polyglot (Prolegomena, p. 34a), asserts that "Rhenanus testifies
          that Waldo, bishop of Freising [884-906] about the year 800
          [sic!] translated the Gospels into German" (cf. Hauck, KD, ii,
          620, 704, 712). Detached fragments of the Gospels have been
          published by F. Keinz (SMA, 1869, p. 546) and J. Haupt
          (Germania, xiv, 1869, p. 440), which are in a handwriting of the
          twelfth century, but show the accents used earlier in the school
          of Notker Balbulus (see [304]Notker, 1; cf. W. Walther, Die
          deutsche Bibelübersetzung des Mittelalters, 3 vols., Brunswick,
          1889-91, 455-465). For the Heliand and Otfrid's Liber
          Evangeliorum or Krist, see [305]Heliand, the, and the Old-Saxon
          Genesis; [306]Otfrid of Weissenburg).

          The first translator after Ulfilas known with certainty is
          Notker Labeo of St. Gall (d. June 29, 1022; see [307]Notker, 5).
          His Job is lost, but his translation of the Psalms can be almost
          completely reconstructed from his German and Latin commentary on
          them (best ed. in P. Piper's Schriften Notkers und seiner
          Schule, 3 vols., Freiburg, 1883-84; facsimile in Vogt and Koch,
          Deutsche Litteraturgeschichte, Leipsic, 1904, and Walther, ut
          sup., 563). Williram, after 1048 abbot of Ebersberg in Bavaria
          (see [308]Williram), made a translation of the Song of Solomon,
          which found so much favor that nineteen manuscripts are still
          known, one written as late as 1528 (cf. Walther, 523-536, with
          facsimile, and J. Seemüller, Die Handschriften und Quellen von
          Willirams Paraphrase, Strasburg, 1877, and Willirams Paraphrase,
          1878; Hauck, KD, iii, 968). An interlinear version of the Psalms
          from the cloister of Windberg, written 1187, was published by E.
          G. Graff, Deutsche Interlinearversionen der Psalmen
          (Quedlinburg, 1839; cf. Walther, 566; also A. E. Schönbach,
          Bruchstücke einer fränkischen Psalmenversion, in ZDAL, xxiv, 2,
          pp. 177-186). Other manuscripts of this kind are mentioned by
          Walther, 568. Some twenty manuscripts and two impressions (the
          one probably by Knubloezer in Strasburg about 1477, the other by
          Peter Drach in Worms 1504) have preserved the commentary of
          Nicolaus de Lyra (see [309]Lyra, Nicolaus de), containing
          translations into German by Heinrich von Mügeln, who was for a
          time with the emperor Charles IV at Prague and seems to have
          left him on account of his edict of 1469 against the German
          books on Holy Scripture (cf. Helm, in Sievers's Beiträge zur
          Geschichte der deutschen Sprache, xxi, 1897, p. 240, xxii, 1898,
          p. 135).

          Especially interesting is Walther's eighth group of translations
          of the Psalms (which include all Latin-German Psalters printed
          in the Middle Ages and two or three manuscripts) on account of
          the fact that the German text does not go back to the Latin
          Vulgate is common use, but to Jerome's version from the Hebrew
          (see above, [310]A, II, 2, § 2). To Walther's ninth group
          belongs the splendid Psalter of St. Florian in three languages,
          Latin, Polish, and German, which was made either for the Polish
          queen Marguerite, daughter of the emperor Charles IV, or for
          Mary, sister of the Polish queen Hedwig of Anjou. Another
          translation is due to Henry of Hesse, rector of the University
          of Heidelberg, who died 1427, a Carthusian. On the eve of the
          Reformation Duke Eberhard I of Württemberg was careful to have
          translations made for him (cf. TLZ, iv, 473; 571).

    2. Printed Bibles before Luther.

          Besides 202 (203) manuscripts, Walther enumerates between 1466
          and 1521 eighteen impressions of complete German Bibles,
          twenty-two of Psalters, and twelve of other parts. Of the
          eighteen complete Bibles, fourteen are in High German. They
          differ from the common Latin Bible by containing the Epistle to
          the Laodiceans and by placing Acts after the Epistles of St.
          Paul. The prayer of Manasses is missing in the first two and
          placed after Chronicles in the rest. Their correct chronological
          order is:

          (1) Strasburg, Mantel, c. 1466 (Hain, Repertorium
          bibliographicum, no. 3130). (2) Strasburg, Eggestein, c. 1470
          (Hain, 3129). (3) Augsburg, Pflansmann, c. 1473 (Hain, 3131).
          (4) Augsburg, G. Zainer, c. 1473, a thorough revision of 2
          (Hain, 3133). (5) Swiss, 1474 (Hain, 3132). (6 and 7) Augsburg,
          G. Zainer, and A. Sorg, 1477 (Hain, 3134-3135). (8) Augsburg, A.
          Sorg, 1480, a repetition of Zainer's impression of 1477 (Hain,
          3136). (9) Nuremberg, A. Koburger, 1483 (Hain, 3137). (10)
          Strasburg, Grüninger, 1485 (Hain, 3138). (11-14) All printed in
          Augsburg, by H. Schönsperger, 1487, 1490 (Hain, 3139-40), H.
          Otmar, 1507, and Silvanus Otmar, 1518.

          All these editions give in the main one and the same version,
          but Zainer (4 above) undertook a thorough revision, which had
          much influence. Koburger (9 above) also made changes. The
          version was already more than 100 years old when first printed.
          Its home is not yet ascertained, but there are traces which
          indicate Bohemia. The Latin text underlying this version is
          interesting especially in Acts, where it has preserved many Old
          Latin readings. Led by an entry in a manuscript of Nuremberg, F.
          Jostes tried to prove that a certain Johannes Rellach of Resöm
          (?) in the diocese of Constance, who he thinks was a Dominican,
          was the author of this version about 1460 (cf. his Meister
          Johannes Rellach, ein Bibelübersetzer des 15. Jahrhunderts, in
          Historisches Jahrbuch, Munich, 1897, 133-145). Kurrelmeyer (Die
          deutsche Bibel, Tübingen, 1904 sqq.) seems to think the version
          older than this Rellach, who may have undertaken a revision of
          it, and he has not pronounced upon the alleged Waldensian origin
          of the version; the manuscript of Tepl may have been in
          Waldensian hands, but this does not prove a Waldensian origin.
          There are certain peculiar readings in which the version agrees
          with the Provençal translation.

          A different translation containing only the Old Testament is
          represented by the "Wenzel" Bible at Vienna, translated from the
          Latin at the command of the emperor Wenceslaus by Martin Rotlev
          later than 1389 (facsimile in Vogt and Koch, ut sup.). A "Bible
          for the Poor" at Maihingen of 1437 gives a German working over
          of the 212 hexameters in which Alexander Villadeus summarized
          all the chapters of the Bible (e.g. Gen. i-vii: sex, prohibet,
          peccant, Abel, Enoch, archa fit, intrant) and counts seventy-six
          books, fifty-eight prologues, 1,457 chapters, and 1,606 verses
          in the Psalter. To the same group belongs a manuscript now at
          Maihingen (1472), beautifully illustrated by Furtmeyer for
          Albert IV of Bavaria, which has between Deuteronomy and Job
          Matt. i-v, 44, like a manuscript in the British Museum written
          by the same copyist in 1465 (cf. the Athenæum for May 31, 1884,
          and R. Priebsch, Deutsche Handschriften in England, i, Erlangen,
          1896). For other versions, cf. Walther.

          The Low German Bibles include the Old Testament of Delft (1477),
          without Psalms, and the famous Picture Bible of Cologne (about
          1478; cf. R. Kautzsch, Die Holzschnitte der Kölner Bibel von
          1479, in Studien zur deutschen Kunstgeschichte, vii, 1896, and
          G. Gerlach, in Dziatzko's Arbeiten, ii, 13, Leipsic, 1896). The
          Song of Solomon in this Bible is not translated but is given in
          Latin. The Bible of Lübeck of 1494 gives, up to II Kings vii, an
          original translation; from that chapter onward text and pictures
          of the Cologne Bible. The edition of Ludwig Trutebul
          (Halberstadt, 1522) is very scarce. On the Psalters cf. Walther,
          682-703, and Kurrelmeyer, ut sup.

          On the "Wenzel" Bible, cf. AJP, xxi, 62-75, and F. Jelinek, Die
          Sprache der Wenzelbibel, Görz, 1898-99. On the pre-Lutheran
          Bibles, cf. A. E. Schönbach, Miscellen aus Grazer Handschriften,
          ii. Reihe, Deutsche Uebersetzungen biblischer Schriften, Graz,
          1899; idem, Ueber ein mitteldeutsches Evangelienwerk aus St.
          Paul, Vienna, 1897, and L. J. M. Bebb, in DB, extra vol.,
          411-413.

    3. Luther's Bible.

          Contemporaneously with Luther others were engaged in translating
          parts of the Bible into modern German, e.g., Böschenstein,
          Lange, Krumpach, Amman, Nachtgal, Capito, and Fröhlich; but
          their works are forgotten (see also below, [311]§ 5). Not
          contemplating at first the entire Bible, Luther began with the
          penitential Psalms (Mar., 1517, improved 1525) and followed with
          the Lord's Prayer and Ps. cx in 1518, the Prayer of Manasses
          with Matt. xvi, 13-20, in 1519, and other pieces. At the end of
          1521 he began with the New Testament. He writes on Dec. 18,
          1521: "Meanwhile I am gathering notes, being on the point of
          translating the New Testament into the vernacular;" two days
          later: "Now I am laboring on annotating and translating the
          Bible into the common speech;" on Jan. 13, 1522, to Amsdorff:
          "Meanwhile I am translating the Bible, though I have undertaken
          a task beyond my strength. The Old Testament I can not touch
          unless you lend your aid" (cf. G. Bossert, in TSK, 1897, pp.
          324, 349, 366). The New Testament was in type Sept., 1522; it
          was published with woodcuts at Wittenberg without name of
          printer or of translator (Das Newe Testament Deutzsch) and was
          sold for one and one-half florins. In December a second edition
          followed (cf. R. Kuhrs, Verhältnis der Decemberbibel zur
          Septemberbibel. Kritischer Beitrag zur Geschichte der
          Bibelsprache M. Luthers. Mit einem Anhang über Joh. Lange's
          Matthäusübersetzung, Greifswald, 1901). Of the Old Testament,
          part i (the five books of Moses) was ready in 1523; parts ii and
          iii (the historical and poetical books) in 1524; the prophets
          did not follow until 1532; and the Apocrypha as a whole not
          until the first complete Bible in 1534. Eleven editions were
          published during Luther's lifetime, besides numerous reprints.
          For the Old Testament he used the edition of Brescia, 1494 (the
          copy is now at Berlin); for the New Testament, the second
          edition of Erasmus (1519), but he consulted the Vulgate, and for
          the Old Testament had the assistance of his friends Melanchthon,
          Bugenhagen, Aurogallus, and all available helps. In the preface
          to Sirach he mentions the earlier German translation, but he
          seems on the whole independent of it. The influence of Luther's
          work was great even outside of Germany. It formed the basis of
          the Danish translation of 1524, of the Swedish and Dutch of
          1528, of the Icelandic of 1540, and, through the mediation of
          Tyndale, influenced the English Authorized Version of 1611.

          Large parts of Luther's autograph printer's copy are preserved,
          and the first part is in print in D. Martin Luther's Deutsche
          Bibel, Weimar, 1906. A catalogue of the original editions of
          Luther's Bible was published by H. E. Bindseil (Verzeichniss der
          Original-Ausgaben, etc., Halle, 1840), who also, in
          collaboration with H. A. Niemeyer, issued a critical reprint of
          the edition of 1545 with a collation of the earlier impressions
          (7 vols., Halle, 1845-55). J. G. Hagemann, Nachricht von denen
          fürnehmsten Uebersetzungen der heiligen Schrift (Brunswick,
          1750), gives a list of editions to 1749. In the Hauck-Herzog RE,
          iii, 74-75, about ninety places are named in which Luther's
          Bible has been printed, with the date of the first edition in
          each place. It includes the following towns in America:
          Germantown, Penn., 1743 (the first Bible in a European language
          printed in America; see [312]Sower, Christopher) and 1763 (cf.
          Basler Bibelbote, 1899, 52); New York, 1854 (N. T.) and 1857
          (complete Bible); Philadelphia, 1846. Reading, Penn., 1813, and
          Lancaster, Penn., 1819, may be added. A chronological list would
          show the influence of Pietism. The first Berlin edition (1699),
          for example, was due to Spener. The first Low German Bible, by
          J. Hoddersen, was printed by L. Diets at Lübeck in 1533; the
          last was that of Lüneburg, 1621.

    4. Revision of Luther's Version.

          By the middle of the nineteenth century six or seven different
          recensions of Luther's version were in use in Protestant Germany
          (cf. C. Mönckeberg, Tabellarische Uebersicht der wichtigsten
          Varianten der bedeutendsten gangbaren Bibelausgaben; New
          Testament, Halle, 1865, Old Testament, 4 vols., 1870-71). In
          1863 a Committee was named by the Eisenach Conference (see
          [313]Eisenach Conference) to undertake a final revision. As the
          result of the labors of this committee the revised New Testament
          appeared in 1867 and again in 1870, Genesis in 1873, the Psalms
          in 1876, the whole Bible (the so-called Probebibel) in 1883. At
          last, in Jan., 1890, the whole work was finished and the first
          impression was published at Halle in 1892. The revised edition
          was adopted in most parts of Germany, though in Mecklenburg it
          is still opposed. A comparison with the English revision shows
          that the German was much too timid (cf., on the one side, P. de
          Lagarde, Die revidierte Lutherbibel des Halleschen Waisenhauses,
          Göttingen, 1885, also in Mittheilungen, iii; on the other, E. V.
          Kohlschütter, Die Revision der Lutherschen Bibelübersetzung,
          1887, and A. Kamphausen, Die berichtigte Lutherbibel, Berlin,
          1894; also TJB, 1886, where twelve pamphlets for and against the
          revision are named; O. H. T. Willkomm, Was verliert unser Volk
          durch die Bibelrevision? Zwickau, 1901).

          Luther's work was criticized early, especially by his Roman
          Catholic opponents--e.g., by Hieronymus Emser, to whom Urbanus
          Rhegius replied in 1524 (see [314]Emser, Hieronymus;
          [315]Rhegius, Urbanus; cf. G. Kawerau's Hieronymus Emser, Halle,
          1898; for criticism from the modern point of view, cf. P. de
          Lagarde, Die revidierte Lutherbibel, ut sup.). The Wittenberg
          edition of 1572 introduced the summaries of Veit Dietrich. A.
          Calovius added in 1661 a " Biblical Calendar" by which it was
          possible to read the Psalms four times every year, Proverbs
          twice, and the rest of the Bible with Luther's prefaces once.
          The Wittenberg faculty added a new preface in 1669. The verse of
          the "three witnesses" (I John v, 7) was first introduced into a
          Frankfort edition of 1575, into a Wittenberg impression in 1596.
          Dietrich's summaries were replaced by those of Leonhard Hutter
          in 1624; in this edition a Roman Catholic compositor changed
          "everlasting gospel" in Rev. xiv, 6, to "new gospel," the verse
          being often applied to Luther, and subsequent editions were
          printed from the sheet as copy. Several editions gave great
          offense because of changes in the text or additions--e.g., an
          edition by N. Funk (Altona, 1815) was asserted to teach a "new
          faith" because of changes in the indexes and notes. The Bible
          Institute founded at Halle by Karl Hildebrand, [316]Baron
          Canstein came to have great influence; after 1717 standing type
          or stereotyped plates were used and millions of copies of the
          Halle text were circulated (see [317]Bible Societies, II, 1).

    5. Other Versions.

          The Anabaptists [318]Hans Denk and [319]Ludwig Hätzer translated
          the Prophets before the completion of Luther's version
          (published by Peter S246;ffer, Worms, 1527; many later
          editions); their work was used by other translators and has been
          praised for scholarship and style (cf. J. J. I. Döllinger, Die
          Reformation, i, Regensburg, 1846, 199; Heberle, in TSK, xxviii,
          1855, 832; L. Keller, Ein Apostel der Wiedertäufer, Leipsic,
          1882, 210 sqq.). The preachers of Zurich published a complete
          Bible in six parts (1525--1529), using Luther's work so far as
          available and adding the Prophets (part iv) themselves and the
          Apocrypha (part v, including III and IV Esdras and III Maccabees
          but not the Prayer of Azariah, the Song of the Three Children,
          the Prayer of Manasses, or the Additions to Esther) by [320]Leo
          Jud. The complete Bible was printed in 1530, without prefaces
          and glosses, the Apocrypha at the end. The edition of 1531 (2
          vols.) has a short admonition and introduction for "the
          Christian reader of these Biblical Books" probably by Zwingli;
          also summaries, parallel references, woodcuts, and a new
          translation of the poetical books. The edition of 1548 (2 vols.)
          professes to have been compared word for word with the Hebrew,
          but really does not differ from editions of 1542 and 1545; it
          became the basis of later editions. The verse division was first
          introduced in 1589. A revision of the Zurich New Testament was
          undertaken by J. J. Breitinger in 1629, by a collegium biblicum
          in 1817, 1860, 1868, and 1882, and a new revision of the New
          Testament and Psalms appeared in 1893 (cf. E. Riggenbach, Die
          schweizerische revidierte Uebersetzung des Neuen Testaments und
          der Psalmen, Basel, 1895).

          Besides the Zurich Bible three other "composite" Bibles (i.e.,
          Luther's translation so far as it had appeared with the missing
          parts supplied from other translations) were published before
          1534: (11 Worms, Peter Schöffer, 1529, the so-called "Baptist"
          Bible, having Hätzer and Denk's version of the Prophets; it was
          the first Protestant Bible to use the word Biblia in the title,
          retained in Luther's Bible till the eighteenth century; (2)
          Strasburg, Wolff Köpphl, 1530, Prophets by Hätzer and Denk,
          Apocrypha by Jud; (3) Frankfort, C. Egenolph, 1534, in which
          only a part of the Apocrypha was not Luther's. The Epistle to
          the Laodiceans was included in these editions.

          About one hundred, years after Luther new versions began to
          appear. The first complete Bible was that of J. Piscator
          (Herborn, 1602), called the "Straf mich Gott" Bible because the
          translator added in smaller type to Mark viii, 12, Wann disem
          geschlecht ein zaichen wirdt gegeben werden, so straffe mich
          Gott ("If a sign be given to this generation, so strike me God;"
          cf. R. Steck, Die Piscatorbibel, Bern, 1897). The Berleburg
          Bible (8 vols., 1726-1742) and the Wertheim Bible (1735) were
          prepared in the interest of mysticism and rationalism
          respectively (see [321]Bibles, Annotated, and Bible Summaries,
          I, §§ 3, 4). Later versions are by J. D. Michaelis (O. T., 13
          vols., Göttingen, 1769 sqq.; N. T., 2 vols., 1790); J. H. D.
          Moldenhauer (O. T., 10 vols., Quedlinburg, 1774 sqq.; N. T., 2
          vols., 1787-88); Simon Grynæus (5 vols., Basel, 1776-77; a
          paraphrase in modern style, the historical books of the O. T,
          abridged, the Gospels harmonized); and G. F. Griesinger
          (Stuttgart, 1824). Better than these is the version of W. L. M.
          de Wette and J. C. W. Augusti (6 vols., Heidelberg, 1809-14;
          later editions by De Wette alone). Bunsen's annotated Bible (9
          vols., Leipsic, 1858-70) has a translation of the Hagiographa by
          A. Kamphausen, of the Apocrypha and N. T. by H. J. Holtzmann,
          other portions by Bunsen.

          Translations of the New Testament alone include: J. Crell, J.
          Stegman the elder, and others, the Socinian N. T. (Rakow, 1630);
          J. Felbinger, also a Socinian (Amsterdam, 1660); J. H. Reitz,
          Reformed (Offenbach, 1703); C. E. Triller (Amsterdam, 1703);
          Count Zinzendorf (Ebersdorf, 1727); Timotheus Philadelphus
          (i.e., J. Kayser, a Stuttgart physician, 1733); C. A. Heumann
          (Hanover, 1748); J. A. Bengal (Stuttgart, 1753); C. T. Damm (3
          vols., Berlin, 1765); C. F. Bahrdt ("the latest revelations of

          Roman Catholic versions have been numerous. Hieronymus Emser's
          New Testament (Dresden, 1527; see [322]Emser, Hieronymus) was
          merely a slight revision of Luther after the Vulgate. J.
          Dietenberger, a Dominican, published the entire Bible at Mainz
          in 1534 (cf. F. Schneider, Johann Dietenberger's Bibeldruck,
          Mainz, 1901). In the New Testament he followed Emser chiefly, in
          the Apocrypha Leo Jud, in the Old Testament he took much from
          Luther. C. Ulenberg revised this version in 1630, and the clergy
          of Mainz in 1662; thenceforth it was commonly called the
          "Catholic" Bible. Later Roman Catholic versions are: T. A.
          Erhard (2 vols., Augsburg, 1722); the Benedictines of the
          cloister of Ettenheimmünster (Constance, 1751); I. Weitenauer
          (14 vols., Augsburg, 1777-81); F. Rosalino (3 vols., Vienna,
          1781); K. H. Seibt (Prague, 1781); H. Braun (13 vols., Augsburg,
          1788-1805; worked over by J. F. Allioli, 6 vols., Nuremberg,
          1830-32); D. von Brentano, T. A. Dereser, and J. M. A. Scholz
          (N. T. by Brentano, 3 vols., Kempten, 1790-91; revised and O. T.
          added by Dereser and Scholz, 15 vols., Frankfort, 1797-1833); K.
          and L. van Ess (3 vols., Sulzbach, 1807-22); H. J. Jäck
          (Leipsic, 1847). Translations of the New Testament alone are: C.
          Fischer (Prague, 1784); B. B. M. Schaappinger (3 vols.,
          Mannheim, 1787-99); S. Mutscheile (2 vols., Munich, 1789-90); B.
          Weyl (Mainz, 1789); J. G. Krach (2 vols., Freiburg, 1790); C.
          Schwartzel (8 vols., Ulm, 1802-05); M. Wittmann (Regensburg,
          1809); J. M. Sailer (Graz, 1822); J. H. Kistemaker (Munich,
          1825; circulated by the British and Foreign Bible Society, which
          now also circulates Allioli's translation); B. Weinhart
          (Freiburg, 1900); A. Arndt, S. J. (Regensburg, 1903); B. Grundl
          (Augsburg, 1903).

          Finally, mention should be made of the scholarly translation of
          the canonical Old Testament, edited by E. Kautzsch in
          collaboration with F. Baethgen, H. Guthe, A. Kamphausen, R.
          Kittel, K. Marti, W. Rothstein, R. Ruëtschi, V. Ryssel, K.
          Siegfried, and A. Socin (Freiburg, 1894; 2d ed., 1896). In the
          supplementary translation of the Apocrypha and Pseudepigrapha
          Prof. Kautzsch had the assistance of G. Beer, F. Blass, C.
          Clemen, A. Deissmann, C. Fuchs, H. Gunkel, H. Guthe, A.
          Kamphausen, R. Kittel, E. Littmann, M. Löhr, W. Rothstein, V.
          Ryssel, F. Schnapp, K. Siegfried, and P. Wendland. Since 1899
          cheap editions called Textbibel, both with and without
          Weizsäcker's New Testament, have been circulated.

          German Israelites have translations of the Old Testament
          prepared under the direction of L. Zunz (Berlin, 1837) and by S.
          Bernfeld (Berlin, 1902). There are also versions in the
          Jewish-German (Yiddish).

  VIII. Greek Versions, Modern.

          Parts of the Old Testament were translated by Jews into modern
          Greek as early as the end of the Middle Ages. A version of the
          Pentateuch made in 1547 has been edited by C. Hesseling
          (Leipsic, 1897). On the whole the Greek Church has been anxious
          to make the people acquainted with the Bible, a fact evinced
          especially in the sixteenth century by the efforts of
          [323]Damascenus the Studite. But when, at the instance of Cyril
          Lucar, Maximos Kalliupolites published in 1638 an edition of the
          New Testament in the original Greek with a modern Greek version,
          the Church as a whole did not favor it, though the patriarch
          Parthenios permitted its circulation. This text was reprinted in
          London in 1703 by the monk Seraphim, also in 1710 at Halle, and
          by C. Reineccius in his polyglot Bible of 1713 (see [324]Bibles,
          Polyglot, V). In the East, Seraphim's edition was expressly
          prohibited by the patriarch Gabriel of Constantinople (1702-04).

          A new period began when the British and Foreign Bible Society
          took the matter in hand. As early as 1810 it published the text
          of Maximos, and English influence induced the patriarchs Cyril
          VI and Gregory V to permit its circulation. Other issues
          followed in 1814, 1819, and 1824. The deficiencies of the old
          text having been long known, it was decided to bring out a new
          translation, which should approach more nearly the ancient
          Greek. For this work the monk Hilarion was employed under the
          direction of the learned Archbishop Conatantius of Sinai,
          afterward patriarch. But when, in consequence of a controversy
          over the Apocrypha (1825-27), the society introduced bibles
          without the Apocrypha, the Greek Church would not circulate
          them. Moreover, after the war of liberation the desire to be
          entirely independent of Occidental aid greatly increased and
          orthodox reaction set in anew. The version of such learned
          Greeks as Typaldos, Bambas, and others found no more favorable
          reception. This disposition has continued. The latest version of
          the New Testament by A. Pallis (Liverpool, 1902), written in
          common Greek, has not been approved. The patriarch Joachim III
          has renewed the prohibition of Bible translation.

  IX. Hebrew Translations of the New Testament:

          The anciently attested Hebrew original of the Gospel of Matthew
          and the Gospel according to the Hebrews are not to be included
          in this treatment (see [325]Matthew, II; [326]Apocrypha, B, I,
          19). Of existing Hebrew versions of the New Testament, the more
          important are the following:

          1. Versions by Jews: (1) The Evangelium Matthæi in lingua
          Hebraica cum versione Latina, by Sebastian Münster, appeared at
          Basel, 1537 (2d ed., Paris, 1541; 3d ed., with Hebrews in Hebrew
          and Latin, Basel, 1557). (2) The Evangelium hebraice Matthæi
          recens e Judæorum penetralibus erutum, with Latin translation,
          edited by Jean du Tillet and Jean Mercier (Paris, 1555) is part
          of a translation of the Gospels by Schemtob Schaprut (1385),
          which may be preserved in a Vatican manuscript. (3) A complete
          translation of the New Testament was made by Ezekiel Rachbi (d.
          1772), and an assistant from Germany.

          2. Versions by Christians: (1) Elias Hutter made a Hebrew
          translation of the complete New Testament for his polyglot
          editions (Nuremberg, 1599, 1602; see [327]Bibles, Polyglot, V);
          a better edition of this version was issued by B. Robertson
          (London, 1661), and the first part of the same by R. Caddick
          (London, 1798). (2) Johannes Baptista Jona translated the four
          Gospels (Rome, 1668). (3) A translation of Matthew by Johannes
          Kemper (d. 1714), with Latin rendering by A. Borelius, is
          preserved in manuscript in the library of the University of
          Upsala. (4) The Epistle to the Hebrews, translated by F. A.
          Christiani, appeared in Leipsic, 1676, and Luke i, 1-xxii, 14,
          by I. Fromman at Halle, 1735. (5) The translation of the whole
          New Testament prepared for the London Society for Promoting
          Christianity among the Jews appeared in 1821, and in revised
          form in 1840 and 1866. (6) The edition of the British and
          Foreign Bible Society, begun in 1864, was made by Franz
          Delitzsch (Leipsic, 1877; stereotyped ed., 1881; revised ed.,
          1885; again revised by Delitzsch and edited by G. Dalman, 1892).
          (7) The translation of the Trinitarian Bible Society, begun by
          Isaac Salkinson and completed by C. Ginsburg, was issued in
          London, 1885.

  X. Hungarian (Magyar) Versions.

    1. The First Versions.

          János Erdösi (or Sylvester; b. 1504; died c. 1560) made the
          first Hungarian translation of the New Testament. After studying
          in Cracow and Wittenberg (1526-29), he returned to his native
          land and worked at Sárvár under the patronage of the magnate T.
          Nádasdi, who erected the first Hungarian printing-press in
          Uj-Sziget (Neanesis). There Erdösi's translation was printed in
          1541. Erdösi was afterward professor of Hebrew in Vienna
          (1542-52); driven out by the Jesuits, he went to Debreczin and,
          in 1557, to Löcse (Leutschau) as teacher and preacher. A little
          later, G. Heltai, pastor at Kolosvár (Klausenburg), and his
          three colleagues translated the New Testament, with several
          books of the Old Testament (Kolosvár, 1552-61). Péter Juhász
          (Melius), pastor and superintendent at Debreczin (1558-72),
          rendered into Hungarian the books of Job and Kings (Debreczin,
          1565), and the New Testament (Szegedin, 1567); of the latter
          work no copy is known. T. Félegyházi, professor and pastor at
          Debreczin, published a translation of the New Testament at
          Debreczin in 1586. Gaspar Károli (d. 1591), a pupil of
          Melanchthon, pastor at Gönc (not far from Kassa), translated the
          entire Bible with the Apocrypha and published it at Visoly,
          1590. This is styled the Visoly Bible, and it has remained in
          use to the present. It has passed through many editions with
          some slight corrections.

    2. The Komáromi Bible.

          During the religious wars (1604-45) against the Austrian
          monarchs the Hungarian nation heroically fought for political
          and religious liberty; to the great Protestant princes of
          Transylvania, Bocskai, Bethlen, and George (György) Rákóczi the
          Protestant Church is much indebted, for without them it would
          have suffered the fate of the Bohemian Church. The victorious
          Rákóczi family caused 10,000 copies of the Bible to be published
          at Várad in 1657. The years 1660 to 1781 were a dark period for
          Hungarian Protestants, during which the Austrian government,
          under Jesuitical influences, took control of the entire kingdom,
          and the freedom gained in the Reformation was lost. The crisis
          came in 1671-81, the so-called "decade of mourning." This
          grievous situation explains the fact that Hungarian bibles had
          to be printed in foreign countries. The learned Reformed pastor
          of Debreczin, György Csipkés Komáromi, an excellent Hebrew
          scholar, in order to meet the common wish and to make the Bible
          keep pace with the growth of the language, made a new
          translation which was approved by the synods in 1681. The city
          of Debreczin at enormous cost had an edition of 4,000 copies
          printed at Leyden in 1718. When the edition reached the frontier
          it was seized by the Jesuits (who had secured from the king an
          order to that effect) and carried to their house at Kassa. The
          agitated citizens and council of Debreczin used all means
          available to recover the books and at length secured a royal
          edict from King Charles III (June 29, 1723) granting them a free
          Bible (P. Bod, Historia Hungarorum ecclesiastica, iii, 89). So
          great was the power of the Jesuits, however, that they
          frustrated the royal edict, and the bishop of Eger, Count F.
          Barkóczy, carried the Komáromi bibles to his palace and threw
          them all into damp cellars, where they remained till 1754, when
          on Nov. 1 he burned them in the court of his palace before a
          large gathering (cf. The Bible Society Monthly Reporter Mar.,
          1904, p. 69). A few copies retained in Varsó, hidden in the
          Prussian ambassador's house, were brought to Debreczin in 1789.

          The Roman Catholics, on their part, had the Bible translated by
          a Jesuit scholar György Káldi, and this translation appeared at
          Vienna, 1626 (see [328]Káldi, György). In the nineteenth century
          Baron A. Bartakovics, archbishop of Eger, ordered a new
          translation, which was made by his secretary, the learned
          Tárkányi (d. 1886); this "Eger Bible" was published at the cost
          of the archbishop in 1862, and again in 1892.

    3. Modern Versions.

          Samuel Kámori, professor in the Lutheran theological academy at
          Pozsony (Pressburg), attempted a new translation of the whole
          Bible with the Apocrypha (Budapest, 1870). Because of the
          translator's modern style and his inadequate knowledge of the
          Magyar tongue, notwithstanding its fidelity to the original,
          this version can not be used by the people. A revision of the
          old Károli text was proposed as early as 1840, and the British
          and Foreign Bible Society assumed the task. The first revision
          of the New Testament was accomplished by J. Menyhárt, professor
          of exegesis in Debreczin College, and by W. Györi, Lutheran
          pastor of Budapest. It was issued at Budapest in 1878 and, being
          sharply criticized, did not gain acceptance. The work of
          revision began more seriously in 1886, when T. Duka, a native of
          Hungary and a member of the committee of the Bible society in
          London, secured the aid of that great organization. Competent
          men were chosen from among the professors and pastors of both
          Churches. After many years' labor, the revised Old Testament
          left the press at Budapest in 1898. This noble work needs
          further revision, and the Hungarian Church awaits the moment
          when the second revision, soon to appear, will be ready. Work on
          the revision of the New Testament is progressing.

          After the great revolution of 1848 and between 1851 and 1861,
          the constitution of Hungary was suspended by the Austrian
          government and the circulation of the Bible was prohibited. The
          Bible depot, the property of the British Society, was ordered to
          be removed, and was located at Berlin; since the coronation of
          Francis Joseph I all hindrances have been removed, and under the
          Hungarian state government circulation of the Bible is free.

  XI. Italian Versions.

          Legend has it that [329]Jacobus de Varagine, bishop of Genoa,
          made an Italian translation of the Bible. There can be no doubt
          that one was prepared as early as the thirteenth century. The
          earliest printed Italian Bible is that of Nicolò di Malherbi, an
          abbot of the Camaldolites, based on the Vulgate and published
          Venice, 1471. In 1530 Antonio Bruccioli published at Venice his
          translation of the New Testament and in 1532 the entire Bible.
          In the same year the New Testament by the Dominican Zaccaria was
          published at Venice, and in 1551 that of Domenico Giglio. After
          this time Geneva became the home of the Italian Bible. A
          congregation of refugees settled there about the middle of the
          sixteenth century, and for their benefit Massimo Teofilo, a
          former Benedictine of Florence, translated the New Testament
          from the Greek (Lyons, 1551). For the Old Testament Bruccioli's
          version was revised and thus in 1562 the first Protestant Bible
          in the Italian language appeared (at Geneva). It was entirely
          superseded in 1607 by the translation of [330]G. Diodati of
          Lucca. This version, made directly from the original texts,
          stands in high esteem for fidelity and has been repeatedly
          reprinted by different Bible societies. A version affecting
          great elegance, but by no means as faithful because made from
          the Vulgate, is that of Antonio Martini, archbishop of Florence
          (Turin, 1776). This version has also been repeatedly reprinted
          by the British and Foreign Bible Society, and in 1889 sqq. an
          illustrated edition was published by the Catholic publisher
          Sonzogno at Milan. [A version of the Gospels and Acts in modern
          Italian prepared under the direction of the St. Jerome Society
          of Rome by Giuseppe Clementi, a secular priest and professor of
          Italian literature, with brief notes by Giovanni Genocchi of the
          Mission of the Sacred Heart, and preface by Giovanni Semeria of
          the Order of St. Paul (Barnabites), was printed at the Vatican
          Press with the approbation of Pope Leo XIII in 1902. The work
          was well received by the public and by scholars, and was
          approved and circulated by many dignitaries of the Roman Church,
          although some feared its influence. The completion of the New
          Testament and translation of the Old, which was contemplated by
          the Society, has been postponed, as it seemed inadvisable to
          Pope Pius X to give the Italian people the epistles of St. Paul
          at the present time. The volume published is sold at a nominal
          price, and about 500,000 copies, it is claimed, have been
          distributed.

  XII. Lithuanian and Lettish Versions.

          A forerunner of the Bible translation for Protestant Lithuanians
          was the rendering of the Scripture lessons from the Gospels and
          Epistles by B. Willent (Königsberg, 1579) from Luther's text
          (edited by F. Bechtel, in Bezzenberger's Litauische und
          lettische Drucke des 16. Jahrhunderts, part 3, Göttingen, 1882).
          The first translator of the Bible in a fuller sense was Jan
          Bretkun (Bretkunas), minister at Labiau and Königsberg (d. 1602
          or 1603). He translated the whole Bible, 1579-90. The
          manuscript, preserved in the university library at Königsberg,
          is described by A. Bezzenberger, Beiträge zur Geschichte der
          litauischen Sprache (Göttingen, 1877), pp. vi-vii. Only the
          Psalms were published (Königsberg, 1625) and the editor, J.
          Rhesa, introduced many changes.

          The Reformed Lithuanians, anxious for a Bible, in 1657
          commissioned Samuel Boguslaw Chylinski to go to England and have
          the Bible printed there (cf. H. Reinhold, in Mittheilungen der
          litauischlitterarischen Gesellschaft, vol. iv, part 2, p. 105).
          The Old Testament as far as the Psalms was presented to the
          synod at Wilna in print in 1663, other parts in manuscript. Of
          this Bible impression only three copies, all imperfect, are
          known to exist. Chylinski was the translator.

          The New Testament, translated by Samuel Bythner, was published
          at Königsberg, 1701, for the benefit of the Lutherans (new ed.,
          Berlin, 1866). A New Testament translated by different ministers
          was published at Königsberg in 1727. The Old Testament was
          prepared in the same way and the whole Bible was published at
          Königsberg, 1735. In the beginning of the nineteenth century the
          need of a new edition of the Bible was felt, and the work was
          undertaken, with the help of the British and Foreign Bible
          Society, by a number of clergymen and especially by L. J. Rhesa.
          It was based on Luther's version, with comparison of the Hebrew
          and Greek originals, and was published at Tilsit, 1824.

          For the Roman Catholic Lithuanians, Joseph Arnulf Giedraitis
          (Polish, Giedroj?), bishop of Samogitia, translated the New
          Testament from the Vulgate (Wilna, 1816).

          The oldest specimen of Lettish printing, the Enchiridion
          (Königsberg, 1586-87; called in later editions Vademecum and
          "Hand-Book"), contains among other writings for ecclesiastical
          use the Scripture lessons for Sundays and festivals for the
          Evangelical Letts (in later editions enlarged by parts of the
          Old Testament). The first Lettish Bible, translated by E. Glück
          and C. B. Witten, was published at Riga, 1685-89. In 1877 A.
          Bielenstein published at Mitau a thoroughly revised edition.

  XIII. Persian Versions.

          Chrysostom mentions Persians as well as Syrians, Egyptians,
          Ethiopians, and other nations as being in possession of the
          Gospel; but it is very doubtful whether there was at that time a
          version of Scripture in the Persian tongue, since Syrian
          influence predominated in the Persian Empire. It is said,
          however, that Chosroes II had the Scriptures brought from Edessa
          (cf. TLZ, 1896, 432, and Theodoret, Hist. eccl., i, 5). All that
          was known in Europe till 1700 of Biblical and other texts is
          found in Lagarde, Persische Studien (Göttingen, 1884), 3-8.

          A translation of the Pentateuch by the Persian Jew Jacob ben
          Joseph Tawus, printed in Hebrew characters, is contained in a
          polyglot Pentateuch of Constantinople (1546), and was
          transcribed into Persian characters with a Latin translation by
          T. Hyde in vol. iv of Walton's Polyglot. The Gospels, translated
          from the Greek, were edited by Abraham Wheelocke and, after his
          death, by Pierson (London, 1657), and another translation from
          the Syriac was printed in vol. v of Walton's Polyglot, and used
          by Tischendorf after the edition of C. A. Bode (Helmstadt,
          1750-51). In Paris are parts of two different translations of
          the Old Testament, the one made from the Hebrew, the other from
          the Aramaic (cf. Zotenberg, Catalogue des manuscrits Hebreux,
          etc., Paris, 1866 sqq., and Lagarde, Persische Studien, i, 69,
          and ii, and his Symmicta, ii, Göttingen, 1879, 14-17). On Jewish
          reports about the Bible in the language of Elam and Media cf. L.
          Blau, Einleitung in die heilige Schrift (Budapest, 1894), 80-94.

          E. Nestle.

          For partial translations of the Bible, particularly of the
          Pentateuch, the Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Canticles, the
          Minor Prophets, Esther, Daniel, Tobit, Judith, Job, and
          Lamentations, preserved in manuscript, cf. JE, iii, 190, vii,
          318-319. The oldest fragments of this character are probably
          those found in the Pahlavi Shikandgumanig Vijar, which dates
          from the latter part of the ninth century (ed. Jamasp-Asana and
          E. W. West, Bombay, 1887; transl. by E. W. West, SBE, xxiv, 117
          sqq.). These fragments are Gen. i, 2-3, ii, 16-17, iii, 9,
          11-16, 18-19, vi, 6; Ex. xx. 5; Deut. xxix. 4, xxxii. 35; Ps.
          xcv. 10; Isa. xxx. 27-28, xliii. 19; Matt. i. 20, v. 17, vii.
          17-18, xii. 34, xv. 13, xviii. 32; Luke v. 31-32, vi. 44, xv. 4;
          John i. 11, 14, viii. 23, viii. 37-38, 42-45, 47; and Rom. vii.
          19-20. They were quoted for anti-Christian polemics, and from
          the forms of the proper names seem to have been derived from a
          Syriac original, though traces of the Targum of the
          pseudo-Jonathan (see above, [331]A, V, § 3) may be discovered in
          the renderings of Ex. xx, 5 and especially of Gen. iii, 14 (cf.
          L. H. Gray, in Actes du XIV. congrès international des
          orientalistes, i, Paris, 1905, 182-186). Equally interesting are
          the fragments of the New Testament in Estrangelo script but in
          an Iranian dialect (probably Sogdhian, thus constituting almost
          the only known remains of this dialect), discovered in Turfan,
          Eastern Turkestan, in 1903. These citations are Manichean in
          origin, and the following passages are thus far known: Matt. x,
          14 sqq.; Luke i, 63-80; John xx, 19 sqq.; Gal. iii, 25 sqq., and
          a number of smaller fragments which are adaptations and
          compilations rather than translations (cf. F. W. K. Müller, in
          appendix to the Abhandlungen der Berliner Akademie, 1904, pp.
          34-37, and Sitzungsberichte der Berliner Akademie, 1907, pp.
          260-270). Mention may also be made of a Persian version of Gen.
          i-vi, 6, by Abhichand, a Hindu converted to a mixture of Judaism
          and Mohammedanism by the Judeo-Persian poet Sarmad early in the
          seventeenth century, and preserved in the Dabistan. This version
          differs materially from the translation of Jacob Tawus.

  XIV. Portuguese Versions.

          Portuguese versions begin with that by Joao Ferreira d'Almeida,
          a former Roman Catholic priest (New Testament, Amsterdam, 1681;
          Old Testament, revised and continued by Danish missionaries,
          Tranquebar, 1719-1751). A Roman Catholic version, with
          annotations, by Antonio Pereira de Figueiredo, was published in
          Lisbon, 1778 sqq. (23 vols.; revised ed., greatly improved,
          1794-1819).

          A version based on Almeida's translation was made by the Rev.
          Thomas Boys, and published by the Trinitarian Bible Society
          (London, 1843-47). The British and Foreign Bible Society has
          often printed revised editions of both Almeida's and Pereira's
          versions. The need of a better and more accurate translation of
          the Bible in the Portuguese language is generally recognized by
          Protestant missionaries and laborers in Portugal and Brazil.

          account of the literature); DB, extra vol., pp. 410-411.

  XV. Scandinavian Versions.

    1. Before the Reformation.

          Of the Scandinavian countries, Norway and its colony, Iceland,
          had at a very early period a national literature in the Old
          Norwegian tongue (incorrectly called Old Norse). To the earliest
          period of Bible translation belongs the Stjorn ("Dispensation,"
          sc., of God), which includes Gen.-II Kings. This is not a
          translation but a paraphrase of these books on the basis of the
          Vulgate, with explanatory remarks from different
          authors--Josephus, Augustine, Peter Comestor, Vincent of
          Beauvais, and others. The preface states that it was prepared
          under the patronage of King Haakon V (1299-1319), and from a
          note in one of the manuscripts it appears that Brand Jonson,
          bishop of Hole is Iceland (d. 1264), made the translation. If
          this note is correct, Jonson probably translated the middle and
          most ancient part (Ex. xix-Deut. xxxiv). The Stjorn was edited
          by Prof. C. R. Unger (Christiania, 1862). In the Old Norwegian
          literature there exist many homilies, legends of the saints, and
          apocryphal Acts of the Apostles which contain many Bible texts;
          these were put together and published by J. Belsheim under the
          title Af Bibelen i Norge og paa Island i Middelalderen
          (Christiania, 1884).

          The earliest traces of a translation of the Bible into Old
          Swedish appear in the time of St. Bridget. In her "Revelations"
          as well as in accounts of her life it is said that she had a
          copy of the Bible made in Swedish. This was undoubtedly only an
          exposition of the Pentateuch composed by her father confessor
          Matthias in Linköping (d. 1350; see [332]Bridget, Saint, of
          Sweden). Joshua and Judges were translated later by Nils
          Ragnvaldson (d. 1514), while Judith, Esther, Ruth, and Maccabees
          were translated by Jens Budde of the Nådendal monastery. There
          is also extant a translation of the Apocalypse, made prior to
          1520. All these Biblical works, based on the Vulgate, were
          edited by G. E. Klemming, in Svenska Medeltidens Bibelarbeten (2
          vols., Stockholm, 1848-55).

          An old Danish version based on the Vulgate, containing the first
          twelve books of the Old Testament, is contained in a manuscript
          of the Mariager monastery in Jutland, antedating 1480. The first
          eight books were edited by Prof. C. Molbech (Copenhagen, 1828).
          A translation of the Psalms of the same period is extant in
          different manuscripts. Some of them were edited by C. J. Brandt,
          in Gamle danske Läsebog (Copenhagen, 1857).

    2. Since the Reformation.

          In both Denmark and Sweden the entire Bible was first translated
          in the period of the Reformation. Norway was united with Denmark
          from 1380 to 1814 and the Danish language, being cognate with
          the Norwegian, became the common literary language in the two
          countries. The New Testament was first rendered into Danish by
          Hans Mikkelsen, formerly burgomaster of Malmö, who followed
          Christian II into exile in the Netherlands in 1523. This New
          Testament appeared at Leipsic in 1524. Being a mixture of Danish
          and German, the language was uncouth. A better translation was
          made by Christen Pedersen (d. 1554), the first editor of the
          history of Denmark by Saxo Grammaticus and of other older works.
          Pedersen's New Testament was printed at Antwerp 1529 and again
          in 1531, and in the latter year his translation of the Psalms
          appeared. Previous to this (1528) a translation of the Psalms
          made by Frans Wormordsen, a Dutchman by birth, was published at
          Rostock. All these followed the Vulgate closely, but were
          influenced by Luther and Erasmus. The Danish Reformer Hans
          Tausen (d. 1561, as bishop of Ribe [Ripen]) translated the
          Pentateuch from Luther's version (Magdeburg, 1535). Peder
          Tidemand translated Judges (Copenhagen, 1539), and Wisdom and
          Ecclesiasticus (Magdeburg, 1541). The first complete Bible in
          Danish was published at Copenhagen is 1550, following, according
          to the instructions of Christian III, as much as possible
          Luther's version. The greater part of the work was done by
          Christen Pedersen, assisted by a number of professors. A new
          edition followed, 1589, reprinted 1633. A translation from the
          original languages, prepared by Hans Paulsen Resen (d. 1638),
          appeared in 1607, and, revised by Bishop Hans Svane or Svaning
          (the so-called Svaning Bible), again in 1647 and was used till
          the middle of the nineteenth century. In 1819 Bishop [333]F. C.
          K. H. Münter with others undertook a revision of the New
          Testament, and the whole Bible, revised by C. Rothe, C.
          Hermansen, and C. Kalkar under the presidency of Bishop [334]H.
          L. Martensen was published in 1872. There are translations made
          by other scholars, such as C. Bastholm (New Testament, 1780), O.
          H. Guldberg (New Testament, 1794), the whole Bible, by J. C.
          Lindberg (1837-56) and C. Kalkar (1847), the four Gospels by K.
          F. Viborg (1863), and the New Testament by Bishop T. S. Rördam
          (1886; 2d ed., 1894-95). A Roman Catholic version of the New
          Testament after the Vulgate was published by J. L. V. Hansen in
          1893.

          After the separation of Norway from Denmark in 1814, three
          revisions of the New Testament were made (1819, 1830, and 1873),
          the most important being by Prof. Hersleb in 1830. A new
          translation of the Old Testament undertaken by Adjunct
          Thistedahl and Profs. Kaurin, Holmboe, Caspari, and Nissen was
          published in parts (1857-1869; revised ed. completed 1890), and
          of the New Testament by Bishops F. W. Bugge, A. C. Bang, and
          others was published in 1904.

          The New Testament was rendered into the Norwegian vernacular,
          which much resembles the Old Norwegian, by Prof. E. Blix, I.
          Aasen, M. Skard, and J. Belsheim, and published in 1889 (new
          ed., 1899). A translation of parts of the Old Testament is in
          preparation and the Book of Psalms was printed in 1904, Genesis
          in 1905. A translation of the New Testament for the use of Roman
          Catholics has also been published. During the Reformation period
          Iceland also received the Bible in its old Norwegian-Icelandic
          tongue. An Icelander, Odd Gottskalkson, of Norwegian descent,
          translated the New Testament, which was published at Roskilde,
          1540. The whole Bible translated after Luther's version by
          Bishop Gudbrand Thorlakson appeared in 1584 (revised 1644). A
          new translation by Bishop Stein Jonson was issued in 1728, but
          the rendering was not smooth, so the older version of Thorlakson
          was reprinted at Copenhagen in 1747, and the New Testament again
          in 1750 and 1807, followed in 1813 by a reprint of the whole
          Bible. In 1827 a new translation of the New Testament was
          published, followed by a revised edition of the whole Bible in
          1841, and by a revised edition, Oxford, 1863.

          When Gustavus Vasa became king of Sweden in 1523, wishing for a
          Swedish translation, he applied to Archbishop Johannes Magni of
          Upsala, requesting him with the help of the clergy to prepare a
          translation of the New Testament. The archbishop devised a plan
          which, however, was opposed by some of the ministers. Bishop
          Hans Brask of Linköping said that "it were better for Paul to
          have been burned, than to be known by every one." The New
          Testament translated by the chancellor [335]Lorenz Andreä with
          the assistance of [336]Pastor Olaus Petri was published at
          Stockholm 1526. The whole Bible, translated by Lars Petri,
          archbishop of Upsala (d. 1573), was issued 1540-41. This Bible,
          made after Luther's, was for a long time the church Bible of
          Sweden. A revised edition by the two bishops Gezelius in Abo
          (father and son; see [337]Gezelius, Johannes) was highly
          praised. Different commissions for translating the Bible were
          appointed; one, consisting of twenty-three members, spent a long
          time in preparing a translation with a rationalistic tendency;
          but the "specimens" published from time to time found no favor.
          In 1844 the commission was reconstituted, with Prof. A. Knös as
          one of its most active members. The New Testament prepared by
          the cathedral provosts C. A. Thoren and H. M. Melin and
          published in 1853-77 was not favorably received. A better
          reception met the version of the New Testament prepared by
          Archbishop Sundberg, Cathedral Provost Thoren, and Bishop
          Johanson, published in 1882. A new translation of the Old
          Testament is in preparation. The Bible version of Cathedral
          Provost Melin was published in 1865-89.

  XVI. Slavonic Versions.

    1. The Old Church Slavonic Version.

          The history of Bible versions in the Slavonic begins with the
          second half of the ninth century. The oldest translation,
          commonly called the Church Slavonic, is closely connected with
          the activity of the two apostles to the Slavs, Cyril and
          Methodius, in Moravia, 864-865 (see [338]Cyril and Methodius).
          The oldest manuscripts are written either in the so-called
          Cyrillic or the Glagolitic character. The former is the Greek
          majuscule writing of the ninth century with the addition of new
          characters for Slavic sounds which are not found in the Greek of
          that time; the latter was a style of the Greek minuscule with
          the addition of new signs as in the Cyrillic alphabet. The
          oldest manuscripts are written in the Glagolitic, which is older
          than the Cyrillic. The oldest manuscripts extant belong to the
          tenth or eleventh century, and the first complete collection of
          Biblical books in the Church Slavonic language originated in
          Russia in the last decade of the fifteenth century. It was made
          by Archbishop Gennadius of Novgorod, and the Old Testament was
          translated partly from the Vulgate, and partly from the
          Septuagint. The New Testament is based upon the old Church
          Slavonic translation. During the sixteenth century a greater
          interest in the Bible was awakened in South and West Russia,
          owing to the controversies between adherents of the Orthodox
          Church and the Roman Catholics and Uniates. In the second half
          of the sixteenth century the Gospels, Acts, and Epistles, and
          parts of the Psalter were often printed at Lemberg and Wilna,
          though the oldest edition of the Acts and Epistles was issued at
          Moscow in 1564. In 1581 the first edition of the Slavonic Bible
          was published at Ostrog, a number of Greek manuscripts, besides
          the Gennadius Bible, having been used for this edition. But
          neither the Gennadius nor the Ostrog Bible was satisfactory, and
          in 1663 a second somewhat revised edition of the latter was
          published at Moscow. In 1712 the czar Peter the Great issued a
          ukase ordering the printed Slavonic text to be carefully
          compared with the Greek of the Septuagint and to be made in
          every respect conformable to it. The revision was completed in
          1724 and was ordered to be printed, but the death of Peter
          (1725) prevented the execution of the order. The manuscript of
          the Old Testament of this revision is in the synodal library at
          Moscow. Under the empress Elizabeth the work of revision was
          resumed by a ukase issued in 1744, and in 1751 a revised
          "Elizabeth" Bible, as it is called, was published. Three other
          editions were published in 1756, 1757, and 1759, the second
          somewhat revised. All later reprints of the Russian Church Bible
          are based upon this second edition, which is the authorized
          version of the Russian Church.

    2. Russian Versions.

          The Church Slavonic is not intelligible to the Russian people.
          An effort to produce a version in the vernacular was made by
          Frantsisk Skorina (d. after 1535), a native of Polotsk in White
          Russia. He published at Prague, 1517-19, twenty-two Old
          Testament books in the "Russian language," in the preparation of
          which he was greatly influenced by the Bohemian Bible of 1506
          (see below, [339]§ 5). Other efforts were made during the
          sixteenth and seventeenth centuries, but the Church Slavonic
          predominated in all these efforts. Peter the Great felt that the
          mass of the Russian people needed a Bible in the vernacular and
          authorized Pastor Glück in 1703 to prepare such an edition.
          Unhappily Glück died in 1705 and nothing is known of his work.
          It was left to the nineteenth century in connection with the
          establishment of the Russian Bible Society (founded in 1812 at
          St. Petersburg, with the consent of Alexander I; see [340]Bible
          Societies, II, 5) to prepare a Bible in the vernacular. The work
          was under taken by [341]Philaret, rector of the Theological
          Academy of St. Petersburg (afterward metropolitan of Moscow),
          and other members of the faculty of the academy. The Gospels
          were published in 1818 and in 1822 the entire New Testament. In
          1820 the translation of the Old Testament was undertaken, and in
          1822 Philaret's translation of the Psalms was published. In 1825
          the Pentateuch, Joshua, Judges, and Ruth were issued. The year
          1826 saw an end to the activity of the Bible Society in the ban
          put upon all kinds of private associations, even when
          non-political. Not before 1858 was the work of translation
          resumed. In 1876 the entire Bible was published in one volume.
          The Old Testament books, though based upon the Hebrew, follow
          the order of the Septuagint and the Church Slavonic Bible. The
          Apocryphal books also form a part of the Russian Bible. The
          British and Foreign Bible Society also issued a Russian edition,
          omitting, however, the Apocrypha.

    3. Bulgarian and Servian Versions.

          The Bulgarians too were provided during the nineteenth century
          with translations of Biblical books into the vernacular. In 1828
          the New Testament was published at Bucharest (2d ed., 1833),
          translated by the pastors Sapunov and Seraphim. For the British
          and Foreign Bible Society the archimandrite Theodosius, abbot of
          the Bistrica monastery, translated the New Testament, which was
          printed at London in 1828. The entire edition was sent to St.
          Petersburg and is said to have been destroyed there. A new
          translation of the New Testament was published at Smyrna in 1840
          (3d ed., Bucharest, 1853, and often). In 1867 the American Bible
          Society printed in New York a translation of the New Testament
          and other editions were issued at Constantinople in 1866 and
          1872. The Old Testament "translated from the original" was also
          published there in three parts (1862-64), but without the
          Apocrypha. An edition of the entire Bible "faithfully and
          accurately rendered from the original" was published by the same
          society at Constantinople in 1868 (3d ed., 1874). A translation
          of the New Testament into Servian was made by Vuk Stefanovi?
          Karaji?, the founder of modern Servian literature, and published
          at Vienna in 1847. The Old Testament was translated by Vuk's
          pupil Dyuro Danichi? and issued at Belgrade in 1868. The
          language in both is excellent. The Servian Bible of Atanasiie
          Ivanovi? Stoikovi? (published by the Russian Bible Society at
          St. Petersburg, 1824) is not written in the vernacular, but is a
          mixture of Church Slavonic and Servian.

    4. Slovenian and Croatian Versions.

          The Bible versions for the Slovenes are most closely connected
          with the activity of the Reformer of Carniola, Primus Truber
          (1507-86; see [342]Truber, Primus), and his associates and
          successors; they were intended for the Evangelical Slovenes.
          Truber translated the Gospel of Matthew, which was printed at
          Reutlingen in 1555; in 1557 the first part of the New Testament
          was published at Tübingen, the second part in 1560, and the
          complete New Testament was issued in 1582; the Psalms appeared
          in 1566. Dalmatin, who assisted Truber, translated the Old
          Testament, and an edition of the entire Scriptures in Slovenian
          was published under his direction at Wittenberg in 1584. Stevan
          Kuezmics published a New Testament for the Hungarian Slovenians
          in their dialect at Halle in 1771. An edition published at Güns
          (Köszeg) in 1848 has the Psalms added. In 1784 a part of the New
          Testament for the use of Roman Catholics was printed at Laibach,
          translated from the Vulgate by several hands. The second part of
          the New Testament was issued in 1786, and the Old Testament
          between 1791 and 1802. Efforts were also made to prepare a Bible
          version for the Evangelical Croats or for those who should be
          brought over to the Evangelical faith. A New Testament
          translated by Anton Dalmata and Stipan Consul was printed in
          Glagolitic characters (2 parts) at Tübingen, 1562-63. In the
          seventeenth century efforts were made to give a translation to
          the Catholic Croats and Servians in the so-called Illyrian
          dialect, but nothing was printed till the nineteenth century
          when a Bible in Latin letters together with the parallel text of
          the Vulgate, translated into "the Illyric language, Bosnian
          dialect" by Petrus Kataucsich, was published at Budapest (6
          parts, 1831). It followed the Vulgate slavishly.

    5. Bohemian Versions.

          The Czech literature of the Middle Ages is very rich in
          translations of Biblical books, made from the Vulgate (cf. the
          list of manuscripts and prints in J. Jungmann, Historie
          Literatury ?eské, Prague, 1849). During the fourteenth century
          all parts of the Bible seem to have been translated at different
          times and by different hands. The oldest translations are those
          of the Psalter. The New Testament must also have existed at that
          time, for according to a statement of Wyclif, Anne, daughter of
          Charles IV, received in 1381 upon her marrying Richard II of
          England a Bohemian New Testament. It is certain that Huss had
          the Bible in Bohemian before him as a whole and he and his
          successors undertook a revision of the text according to the
          Vulgate. The work of Huss on the Bible antedated 1412. During
          the fifteenth century the revision was continued. The first
          complete Bible was published at Prague, 1488; other editions
          were issued at Kuttenberg, 1489, and Venice, 1506. These prints
          were the basis of other editions which were published from time
          to time.

          With the United Brethren a new period began for the translation
          of the Bible. In 1518 the New Testament appeared at Jungbunzlau
          at the instance of [343]Luke of Prague. It was not satisfactory
          and the same must be said of the edition of 1533. Altogether
          different was the translation made by Jan Blahoslav from the
          original Greek (1564, 1568). The Brethren anon undertook the
          translation of the Old Testament from the original and appointed
          for this work a number of scholars, who based their translation
          upon the Hebrew text published in the Antwerp Polyglot. The work
          began in 1577 and was completed in 1593, and from the place of
          printing, Kralitz in Moravia, it is known as the Kralitz Bible
          (6 parts, 1579-93, containing also Blahoslav's New Testament).
          This excellent translation was issued in smaller size in 1596,
          and again in folio in 1613 (reprinted at Halle in 1722, 1745,
          1766; Pressburg, 1787; Berlin, 1807).

          After the year 1620 the publication of non-Catholic Bibles in
          Bohemia and Moravia ceased, and efforts were made to prepare
          Bibles for the Catholics. After some fruitless beginnings the
          work was entrusted to certain Jesuits, who took the Venice
          edition of 1506 as the basis, but relied greatly, especially for
          the Old Testament, on the Brethren's Bible. Between 1677 and
          1715 the so-called St. Wenceslaus Bible was published at the
          expense of a society founded in honor of the saint. A new
          edition appeared at Prague 1769-71. A thoroughly revised
          edition, using the text of the Brethren's Bible, was published
          in 1778-80. Still more dependent on the Brethren's Bible was
          Prochaska's New Testament (Prague, 1786), and his edition of the
          whole Bible (1804). Editions of Prochaska's text, slightly
          amended, were issued in 1851 and 1857. The Bible edited by
          BesdEka (Prague, 1860) gives the text of the Brethren's Bible
          with slight changes. G. Palkovi? translated the Bible from the
          Vulgate into Slovak (2 parts, Gran, 1829).

    6. Wendish or Sorbic Versions.

          The oldest Sorbic Bible version, that of the New Testament of
          1547, is extant in a manuscript in the Royal Library at Berlin.
          The translator was Miklawusch Jakubica, who employed a dialect
          (the Lower Sorbic) now extinct. In the eighteenth century
          Gottlieb Fabricius, a German, made a translation of the New
          Testament which was printed in 1709. In a revised form this
          version was published by the British and Foreign Bible Society
          in 1860. The Old Testament, translated by J. G. Fritz, was
          printed at Kottbus in 1796. An edition of the entire Bible was
          published by the Prussian Bible Society in 1868.

          Michael Frentzel, Pastor in Postwitz (d. 1706), translated the
          New Testament into the Wendish of Upper Lusatia (Upper Sorbic),
          and his version was published by his son, Abraham Frentzel
          (Zittau, 1706). A complete edition of the Bible, the work of
          different scholars, was first published at Bautzen, 1728. A
          second revised edition was prepared by Johann Gottfried Kühn and
          issued in 1742; a third improved edition prepared by Johann
          Jacob Petschke was published in 1797. Passing over other
          editions, it is worth while to note that the ninth edition of
          the complete Bible (Bautzen, 1881) was revised by H. Immisch and
          others and contains a history of the Upper Lusatian Wendish
          Bible translation. For the Roman Catholic Wends of Upper Lusatia
          G. Lus?anski and M. Hornik translated the New Testament from the
          Vulgate, and published it at Bautzen, 1887-92; the Psalms were
          translated from the Hebrew by J. Laras (Bautzen, 1872).

    7. Polish Versions.

          The history of the Polish translation of the Bible begins with
          the Psalter (cf. W. Nehring, Altpolnische Sprachdenkmäler,
          Berlin, 1886). A manuscript of the second half of the fourteenth
          century, in the abbey of St. Florian, near Linz, in Latin,
          Polish, and German is probably the oldest. A critical edition of
          the Polish part was published by Nehring (Psalterii Florianensis
          pars Polonica, Posen, 1883) with a very instructive
          introduction. Besides the Florian Psalter there is the Psalter
          of Pulawy (now in Cracow) belonging to the end of the fifteenth
          century (published in facsimile, Posen, 1880).

          Polish Bibles originated after the middle of the fifteenth
          century. An incomplete Bible, the so-called Sophia Bible (named
          after Queen Sophia, for whom it was intended, according to a
          remark from the sixteenth century; also called the Sárospatak
          Bible from the place where it is preserved), contains Genesis,
          Joshua, Ruth, Kings, Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, II (III)
          Esdras, Tobit, and Judith (ed. A. Malecki, Biblia Krolowéj
          Zofii, Lemberg, 1871). With the Reformation period activity in
          the work of translation increased as the different confessions
          endeavored to supply their adherents with texts of the Bible. An
          effort to provide the Lutherans with the Bible in Polish was
          made by [344]Duke Albert of Prussia in a letter directed in his
          name to Melanchthon. Jan Sieklucki, preacher at Königsberg (d.
          1578), was commissioned to prepare a translation, and he
          published, the New Testament at Königsberg, 1551 and 1552. The
          Polish Reformed (Calvinists) received the Bible through Prince
          Nicholas Radziwill (1515-65). A company of Polish and foreign
          theologians and scholars undertook the task, and, after six
          years' labor at Pincow, not far from Cracow, finished the
          translation of the Bible which was published at the expense of
          Radziwill in Brest-Litovak, 1563 (hence called the Brest or
          Radziwill Bible). The translators state that for the Old
          Testament they consulted besides the Hebrew text the ancient
          versions and different modern Latin ones. The Brest Bible was
          not universally welcomed. The Reformed suspected it of Socinian
          interpretations; the Socinians complained that it was not
          accurate enough. The Socinian Simon Budny especially charged
          against the Brest Bible that it was not prepared according to
          the original texts, but after the Vulgate and other modern
          versions, and that the translators cared more for elegant Polish
          than for a faithful rendering. He undertook a new rendering, and
          his translation ("made anew from the Hebrew, Greek, and Latin
          into the Polish") was printed in 1572 at Ne?vi?h. As changes
          were introduced in the printing which were not approved by
          Budny, he disclaimed the New Testament and published another
          edition (1574). The charges which he made against the Brest
          Bible were also made against his own, and the Socinian Adam
          Czechowicz published a new and improved edition of the New
          Testament (Rakow, 1577). The interesting preface states that
          Czechowicz endeavored to make an accurate translation, but did
          not suppress his Socinian ideas; e.g., he used "immersion"
          instead of "baptism." Another Socinian New Testament was
          published by Valentinus Smalcius (Rakow, 1606).

          The Brest Bible was superseded by the so-called Danzig Bible,
          which finally became the Bible of all Evangelical Poles. At the
          synod in O?arowiec, 1600, a new edition of the Bible was
          proposed and the work was given to the Reformed minister Martin
          Janicki, who had already translated the Bible from the original
          texts. In 1603 the printing of this translation was decided
          upon, after the work had been carefully revised. The work of
          revision was entrusted to men of the Reformed and Lutheran
          confessions and members of the Moravian Church (1604),
          especially to Daniel Mikolajewski (d.1633), superintendent of
          the Reformed churches in Great Poland, and Jan Turnowski, senior
          of the Moravian Church in Great Poland (d. 1629). After it had
          been compared with the Janicki translation, the Brest, the
          Bohemian, Pagnini's, and the Vulgate, the new rendering was
          ordered printed. The Janicki translation as such has not been
          printed, and it is difficult to state how much of it is
          contained in the new Bible. The New Testament was first
          published at Danzig, 1606, and very often during the sixteenth
          and seventeenth centuries. The complete Bible was issued in
          1632, and often since. The Danzig Bible differs so much from
          that of Brest that it may be regarded as a new translation. It
          is erroneously called also the Bible of Paliurus (a Moravian,
          senior of the Evangelical Churches in Great Poland, d. 1632);
          but he had no part in the work.

          For the Roman Catholics the Bible was translated from the
          Vulgate by John of Lemberg (Leopolita, hence this was called the
          Leopolitan Bible) and published at Cracow, 1561, 1574, and 1577.
          This Bible was superseded by the new translation of Jakub Wujek
          (a Jesuit, b. about 1540; d. at Cracow 1593). Wujek criticized
          the Catholic and non-Catholic Bible versions and spoke very
          favorably of the Polish of the Brest Bible, but asserted that it
          was full of heresies and of errors in translation. With the
          approbation of the Holy See the New Testament was first
          published at Cracow, 1593, and the Old Testament in 1599, after
          Wujek's death. This Bible has often been reprinted. Wujek's
          translation follows, in the main, the Vulgate.

  XVII. Spanish Versions.

          It is very difficult to decide at what time the first Spanish
          version was made. In treating of Spanish Bibles, a distinction
          should be made between the Catalonian and the Castilian speech.
          Of Biblical manuscripts in the former there are many from the
          fifteenth century, one (of the New Testament) from the
          fourteenth. Report has it that the Dominican Romeu Sabruguera of
          Mallorca (d. 1313), who translated the Psalms, worked on a
          translation of the entire Bible; but the report can not be
          verified. Most of the Catalonian translations of parts of the
          Bible (Proverbs, the Prophets, Pauline and Catholic Epistles)
          depend on the Vulgate and early French versions; a translation
          of the Psalms depends wholly on the French; the Gospels in the
          oldest manuscripts are not based on the Vulgate but on a text in
          southern French. Of an alleged translation supposed to have been
          printed in Valencia, 1478, no bibliographical datum or exemplar
          is known, only a few fragments being so attributed.

          Of the Castilian translations almost as little is known, since
          no efficient examination of Spanish manuscripts has yet been
          made. If tradition may be accepted, the oldest version belongs
          to the thirteenth century, having been made at the request of
          Alphonso of Castile and John of Leon; but there is no
          confirmation of this statement. It is a remarkable fact that the
          early Castilian versions of the Old Testament were made by Jews,
          and the basis was, naturally, the Hebrew text. Luis de Guzman,
          grand master of the Order of Calatrava, entrusted in 1422 to the
          learned rabbi Moses Arragel of Maqueda the work of translating
          and annotating the Scriptures, but with the help and under the
          supervision of the Franciscan Arias of Enzinas (Enciena) and
          others of the clergy. It accords with this that most of the
          manuscripts follow the order of the Hebrew canon.

          Of printed texts the first in chronological order is the New
          Testament by Francis of Enzinas (Antwerp, 1543); next a Bible
          printed in two editions (Ferrara, 1553), one for Jews, the other
          for Christians (reprinted Amsterdam, 1611, 1630; revised ed.,
          1661). In 1556 Juan Perez published (ostensibly at Venice,
          really at Geneva) an edition of the New Testament, which follows
          the original Greek. In 1569 a Bible was published, probably at
          Basel, in the translation of Cassiodoro de Reina. Another
          edition with slight changes was published by Ricardo del Campo,
          1596, and an entirely revised edition by Cipriano de Valera was
          published at Amsterdam, 1602. The oldest Jewish-Spanish printed
          translation of the Pentateuch is that of Constance, 1547. The
          Old Testament in Hebrew and Spanish was published by Solomon
          Proops at Amsterdam in 1762. It was not until the end of the
          eighteenth century that a Roman Catholic scholar undertook to
          give his Spanish countrymen a new translation, with the Latin
          text and a commentary. The author of this work (10 vols.,
          Valencia, 1790-93; 20 vols., Madrid, 1794-97) was Felipe Scio de
          San Miguel, bishop of Segovia. It was often reprinted. A more
          recent translation, having respect to the original texts, was
          published by Felix Torres Amat, bishop of Astorga (9 vols.,
          Madrid, 1824-29; 6 vols., 1832-35; reprinted, 17 vols., Paris,
          1835). A corrected edition of Amat's version was published under
          the care of Señor Calderon, by the Society for the Promotion of
          Christian Knowledge in 1853. In 1893 the American Bible Society
          published a thoroughly revised edition of Valera's Bible, which
          may be regarded as practically a new version. The work was done
          by H. B. Pratt. A New Testament in the Catalan, translated by J.
          M. Pratt, was issued by the British and Foreign Bible Society.

  XVIII. Bible Versions in the Mission Field.

          Eusebius (Theophania, iii, 28) says that the writings of the
          Apostles were translated in the whole world, in all languages of
          Greeks and barbarians; and Chrysostom and Theodoret repeat the
          remark with still greater emphasis. Nevertheless from this early
          time till the rise of Pietism and the founding of missionary and
          Bible societies little was done by the official Church or
          Churches for the translation and circulation of the Bible. The
          first Report of the British and Foreign Bible Society has an
          account of what was then the most famous collection of Bibles
          (at Stuttgart) and estimates the number of languages represented
          there at forty-one. The Bibles presented to the Society in its
          first year were in forty-six languages, from Arabic and Armenian
          to Turkish and Welsh. The catalogue of Bibles of the British
          Museum includes ninety-seven languages. The hundredth Report of
          the British and Foreign Bible Society, in the "Historical Table
          of Languages and Dialects in which the Translation, Printing, or
          Distribution of the Scriptures has been at any time promoted by
          the Society" (pp. 434 sqq.), gives 378 languages; versions in
          twenty-four languages prepared by other societies have been
          removed from the list. [The total number of languages into which
          the Bible, or parts of it, has now been translated is about
          500.] The best conspectus is afforded by T. H. Darlow and H. F.
          Moule, Historical Catalogue of the Printed Editions of Holy
          Scripture in the Library of the British and Foreign Bible
          Society (2 vols., London, 1903-08).

          and a distinction is not to be sharply drawn. The annotated
          Bible, however, will always include the text, to which the helps
          are strictly subordinate; the commentary is published for the
          sake of the comments and frequently does not include the text.]

  I. German.

          When the Reformation made the Bible the common property of the
          people, it was not only the source of their faith and piety, but
          the only literature, the whole intellectual world, of the
          uneducated classes. The more Luther's Bible was cherished as the
          compendium of religious and ethical truth and became the daily
          reading of the people, the more it needed explanatory notes. As
          early as 1531-33 Luther published his "Summaries of the Psalms,"
          which were incorporated by Bugenhagen in his North Saxon Bible
          (Lübeck, 1534). In the High German Bible "summaries and brief
          contents of all the chapters" are found first appended to the
          Augsburg edition of 1535. Real annotations appeared as parts of
          the book only after Luther's death, first as marginal notes or
          in smaller type under the text (the Wittenberg editions of
          Lufft, 1551, and Krafft, 1572, the latter containing the
          arguments and notes of Veit Dietrich, the Nuremberg preacher).

    1. The Ernestine and Tübingen Bibles.

          It would be a mistake to imagine that the Reformation early
          brought the Bible into every house. There were no small cheap
          editions, and the Thirty Years' War made the earlier ones still
          scarcer. Duke Ernest the Pious of Saxe-Weimar (d. 1675; see
          [345]Ernest I, the Pious) brought about the publication of the
          famous Ernestine Bible, on which, after plans laid out by him,
          nearly thirty prominent theologians worked. Every community was
          to possess a copy; if they were poor, the duke provided it
          wholly or in part. The actual work of preparation began in 1630
          and was completed in 1640. It contained, besides pictures and
          maps, and a running commentary, tables of weights, coins, etc.,
          the topography of Jerusalem, and the creeds and Augsburg
          Confession. It was originally sold at six thalers, but the price
          gradually rose with later improvements and additional
          illustrations, until its general circulation was impeded. The
          Tübingen Bible (1730) is an adaptation of this, less firm in its
          dogmatic stand, by [346]Christoph Matthäus Pfaff, professor at
          Tübingen, and his brother-in-law, Johann Christian Klemm.

    2. Württemberg Bibles.

          The same spirit that actuated Duke Ernest induced Eberhard III
          of Württemberg to publish the "Württemberg Summaries" in 1669,
          the first attempt to give a clear, precise, and connected
          paraphrase of the whole Scriptures. A revised and enlarged
          edition appeared at Leipsic in 1709, followed by others. The
          complete revision published in 1787 by Magnus Friedrich Roos,
          Karl Heinrich Rieger, and others of the school of Bengel was
          less clear, objective, and orthodox. Another Württemberg edition
          which deserves mention is the New Testament published in 1701 by
          the court preacher [347]Johann Reinhard Hedinger; it was marked
          by Pietistic deviations from traditional theology, and attracted
          attention by its sharp rebukes of the sins of the people at
          large and especially of the clergy.

    3. The Marburg, Berleburg, and Ebersdorf Bibles.

          The new spirit of mystical Pietism which influenced the
          last-named work was fully revealed in the Marburg Bible (1712),
          as might be inferred from the main title, "Mystical and
          Prophetic Bible." The interpretation of type and prophecy in
          this follows the federal theology of Cocceius, that of Canticles
          and Revelation Madame Guyon. It was the forerunner of a larger
          work in the same spirit, the Berleburg Bible of 1726-42 (8 vols.
          folio), projected and prepared chiefly by [348]Johann Heinrich
          Haug. The text is a revision of Luther's, with comparison of the
          English and French versions; the commentary reflects the views
          of the Philadelphian communities, and quotes the mystical books
          current among them, especially Madame Guyon's, but its teaching
          goes back beyond Dippel and Petersen to Jakob Böhme, or even to
          Origen in some points. It lacks unity of belief and of
          treatment; it is the work not of a single mystic, giving voice
          to his inner convictions, but of a propagandist sect with
          practical tendencies. It is not without value, however, from
          different points of view; it edifies by its continual
          application of Scriptural words to the spiritual life, and it
          prepares the way for historical criticism by an appendix
          containing apocrypha (Old and New Testament), pseudepigrapha,
          and postapostolic writings. In the same year (1726) appeared the
          Ebersdorf Bible, in the preparation of which Zinzendorf shared.
          Its commentaries are altogether in his spirit, and it was
          received with favor only by the friends of the Herrnhut
          community.

    4. The Wertheim Bible.

          When the emotional mysticism of the Pietists gave way to the
          prosaic, commonplace conceptions of the age of
          [349]Enlightenment, attempts were made to replace the older
          commentaries by works conceived in the new spirit. The Wertheim
          Bible (1735) aroused great excitement in its day, both in Church
          and State, though its interest now is purely historical. This
          was only the first part of a projected whole, and contained
          merely the Pentateuch. The gist of the long, involved preface is
          that the traditional ideas about the Scriptures rested on
          prejudice and unscientific conceptions, and that the attempt was
          now made to found an exposition of their real meaning on
          adequate grounds of reason and historical evidence. It proposes
          to give a free translation, adapted to modern comprehension,
          though faithful in substance, and supplemented by the necessary
          explanations. The translation is hopelessly bald and common
          place to our taste; the editor showed some originality, however,
          as for example in venturing to discard the traditional division
          of chapters and verses. The general philosophical principles, as
          well as the critical and historical, are those of Wolf; in spite
          of many blunders, a fair knowledge of Hebrew is displayed. The
          editor's name is not given, but it was soon known. He was Johann
          Lorenz Schmidt, a graduate of Jena, personally much respected,
          who was then tutor to the young Count von Löwenstein at Wertheim
          in Franconia. He was arrested at the beginning of 1737 and the
          book was confiscated by the imperial authorities. After a year's
          close imprisonment, he was allowed more liberty, and escaped to
          Holland. The literary war which raged around the Wertheim Bible
          was fierce and not uninteresting. In 1738 Schmidt published a
          collection of reviews and polemical pamphlets, with his own
          replies. His work found imitators; another of a similar nature,
          with modern deistic explanations, appeared in 1756, but had
          little success; and the excitement over the frankly
          rationalistic commentary of Nicolaus Funk (Altona, 1815) was not
          wide-spread (cf. J. N. Sinnhold, Ausführliche Historie der
          Wertheim Bibel, Erfurt, 1739).

    5. Later Works.

          The eighteenth century was not destitute of attempts to carry on
          the old tradition in a spirit of orthodox edification. The first
          was that of Christoph Starke (New Testament, 3 vols., 1733 sqq.;
          Old Testament, 6 vols., 1741 sqq.), which gave Luther's text
          with extended comments from older expositors and ascetic
          writers, introductions to each book, and a summary of each
          chapter. Next came the Hirschberg Bible (1756-63), an excellent
          work which fell flat at the time and was rescued from oblivion
          only by a reprint in 1844 under the patronage of Frederick
          William IV. The age was not favorable to the spread of Biblical
          study, and but a few readers were found for the commentary
          translated from English expositors by R. Teller, J. A.
          Dietelmayer, and Brucker (19 vols., 1749-70), or for the edition
          of Michaelis (1769-92).

          But the revival of religious devotion ultimately made itself
          felt in this field. Friedrich von Meyer's revised translation
          with short, pointed comments and uncritical introductions
          appeared in 1819. More widely read were Richter's (1834-40) and
          Lisco's (1833-43). A more learned and thorough work was that of
          Otto von Gerlach in 6 vols., which is still popular in North
          Germany, as is the Calwer Handbuch der Bibelerklärung (1849) in
          the South. Other more recent editions which may be mentioned
          here are those of Bunsen (9 vols., 1858-70), Christian Müller
          (Collegium Biblicum, 6 vols., 1879-84), Johann Peter Lange (36
          vols., 1856-77), K. A. Dächsel (illustrated, 7 vols., 1865-80),
          and R. J. Grau (2 vols., 1877-80). [J. F. Allioli's annotated
          Bible (6 vols., Nuremberg, 1830-34) has been very popular among
          Roman Catholics.]

          (H. Hölscher.)

  II. English.

          As a rule, Bible societies publish the Scriptures "without note
          or comment "--a wise plan, for it secures the widest circulation
          of the Word of God. In early times, however, when a person
          bought a Bible, he found between the covers not only the Old and
          the New Testaments, but a commentary in the notes attached, a
          concordance at the end, and a small dictionary in the
          introduction and tables. These special editions had their day,
          and fell into disuse, for very evident reasons. The numerous
          comments made the volume too bulky for convenience and general
          use; the notes were likely to be one-sided and subjective, so
          that a man's theology might be judged by his Bible, from its
          being supplied with comments by Doddridge, or those of d'Oyly
          and Mant; however acceptable the annotations might be for a
          time, eventually they were superseded by later scholarship.
          Moreover, in the last half-century commentaries, Bible
          dictionaries, and concordance have grown into great volumes, and
          constitute a distinct class of literature. They have found their
          true places apart from the inspired words of the Bible.

    1. Matthew's and the Geneva Bible.

          Annotated Bibles date back to the time of the Reformation.
          Matthew's Bible (1537) had annotations, and John Rogers, who was
          the real translator of this Bible, showed by his notes,
          especially on the subjects of faith, holy life, and repentance,
          that he was in full touch with the most advanced Protestantism.
          The Geneva Bible (1560) attained its great popularity and fame
          by its prologues and marginal notes. These annotations are so
          numerous and miscellaneous that it is not easy to give in a
          brief statement a fair representation of their general tenor.
          Many are strongly antipapal, and for that reason they were
          especially acceptable to overzealous Reformers. As might be
          expected, the Geneva notes are also Calvinistic. When the Geneva
          Bible was first published, Calvin was the ruling spirit in
          Geneva. All the features of his theological, ecclesiastical,
          political, and social system are accordingly reflected in the
          marginal annotations of the English Bible that issued from the
          city of his residence. The political doctrine of the book was as
          much disliked by kings of the absolute order, as were the
          ecclesiastical notes by infallible popes, and one of the reasons
          that led King James, in 1604, to agree readily to a new
          translation of the Scriptures, was his dislike of the politics
          preached on the margins of the Geneva Bible.

    2. The Bishop's Bible.

          The marginal notes in the Bishops' Bible (1568) are not very
          numerous, and they are generally not interesting. They were
          designed mostly for readers of weak capacity. A few, which are
          valuable and entertaining, are taken verbatim, without
          acknowledgment, from the Geneva Bible. Some of them, too, remind
          of Geneva caps and predestination in a way that would scarcely
          be expected in a Bible issued by a body of prelates. The
          distribution of notes in the Bishops' Bible is very irregular
          and unequal. In some books hard to understand, such as the
          prophecies of Isaiah and Jeremiah, the notes are very sparse, so
          that five or six consecutive pages may be found here and there
          without a single annotation; while in other books, such as
          Genesis, Exodus, Job, and the Epistles of St. Paul, the notes
          are very frequent.

    3. The Authorized Version.

          In the original edition of the Authorized Version (1611), the
          number of marginal references to corresponding passages,
          including those in the Apocrypha, was about 9,000. Large as this
          number seems, it is but a small fraction of what the references
          now amount to in some well-edited Bibles. These references,
          doubtless, have their value, but it can not be denied that many
          of them obscure the meaning of the statements to which they are
          attached. It is different, however, with what are called the
          marginal notes. In the original edition (1611) these notes were
          nearly as numerous as the marginal references. In the Old
          Testament there were 6,588 references and 6,637 notes; in the
          New Testament 1,517 references and 765 notes; in the Apocrypha
          885 references and 1,017 notes. These notes are brief and
          non-polemical, differing in these respects very markedly from
          the annotations in both Matthew's and the Geneva Bible. They
          indicate, for the most part, alternative or more literal
          renderings. In some cases they specify variant readings in the
          original text, and, in other cases, they give brief explanations
          of words or expressions. Not a few of the alternative renderings
          they present have been adopted, either verbatim or
          substantially, in the revised version of 1881-85. The headings
          of chapters in the translation of 1611 were new. In the Bishops'
          Bible, the Geneva Bible, and the Great Bible, all the chapters
          were headed with a short table of contents; but the King James
          translators prepared tables of their own. And these tables,
          drawn up in 1611, appear in many editions at the present day
          unaltered, save in some twelve instances.

    4. John Canne's Notes, 1647.

          Other Bibles with notes from the pen of annotators appeared and
          in course of time became very popular. These annotators did not
          write so much for the learned as for the common people, and
          their Bibles became household and family books, laying stress
          more or less on the devotional side. John Canne a Baptist
          minister (d. 1667?), was the author of three sets of notes which
          accompanied three editions of the Bible. His great ambition was
          "to make the Bible its own interpreter." His first authenticated
          version appeared in 1647 at Amsterdam, under the title, The
          Bible, with Marginal Notes, Shewing Scripture to be the Best
          Interpreter of Scripture. The work was often reprinted (9
          editions, between 1662 and 1754). Orme, in his Bibliotheca
          Biblica (Edinburgh, 1824), says of it, "The marginal references
          of Canne are generally very judicious and apposite. They still
          retain a considerable reputation, though most of the latter
          editions which pass under the name of Canne's Bible are full of
          errors, and crowded with references which do not belong to the
          original author."

    5. Other Works to 1701.

          In 1657 there was published Annotations upon All the Books of
          the Old and New Testament. . . . Wherein the text is explained,
          doubts resolved, Scriptures paralleled, and various readings
          observed by the labor of certain learned divines thereunto
          appointed and therein employed, as is expressed in the preface,
          2 vols., London, 1657. This work is usually called the
          "Assembly's Annotations," from the circumstance of its having
          been composed by members of the Westminster Assembly.--Another
          popular work of the same character was Annotations upon the Holy
          Bible wherein the sacred text is inserted, and various readings
          annexed; together with the parallel Scriptures. The more
          difficult terms explained; seeming contradictions reconciled;
          doubts resolved, and the whole text opened. By the Rev. Matthew
          Poole, London, 1863, 2 vols., fo. The work was published in many
          editions. Poole, an eminent non-conformist divine (1624-79), did
          not finish it; but it was completed after his death.--Not less
          popular was a work entitled, The Old and New Testament, with
          Annotations and parallel Scriptures. By Samuel Clarke, A.M.,
          London, 1690. Bishop Lloyd's Bible (London, 1701) was the first
          to incorporate Archbishop Ussher's chronology.

    6. Matthew Henry. Other Works to 1750.

          In 1708 appeared the first volume of Matthew Henry's well-known
          Exposition of the Old and New Testament; four other volumes (to
          the end of the Gospels) were published in 1710, and a sixth
          volume (the Book of Acts) from Henry's manuscript after his
          death (1714); the work was completed by various non-conformist
          clergymen (see [350]Henry, Matthew). It long enjoyed a high and
          deserved reputation, and is distinguished, not for depth of
          learning or originality of views, but for sound practical piety,
          and the large measure of good sense which it discovers.--Dr.
          Edward Wells edited between the years 1709 and 1728, An Help for
          the more Easy and Clear Understanding of the Holy Scriptures,
          after the following method: 1. The common English translation
          rendered more agreeable to the original. 2. A paraphrase wherein
          the text is explained, and divided into proper sections, and
          lesser divisions. 3. Annotations. 4. Preface, 8 vols.--Patrick,
          Lowth, Whitby, and Arnold's Commentary on the Bible, a work of a
          similar character, appeared in London, 1727-60, 7 vols., and was
          reprinted as late as 1821. According to Orme, Patrick was "the
          most sensible and useful commentator on the Old Testament. He
          had a competent measure of learning for the undertaking, of
          which he never makes any ostentatious display. The elder Lowth
          completed the work on the Old Testament, and Whitby commentated
          on the New Testament. Neither Patrick nor Lowth has so much
          Arminianism as Whitby, though they all belong to the same
          theological school. Whitby was superior to both in acuteness and
          research, but if the reader do not find in them the same talent,
          he will be exposed to less injury from specious and sophistical
          reasonings against some important doctrines of
          Christianity."--John Gill published An Exposition of the Old and
          New Testaments, in which the sense of the sacred text is given;
          doctrinal and practical truths are set in a plain and easy
          light; difficult passages explained; seeming contradictions
          reconciled; and whatever is material in the various readings,
          and the several Oriental versions, is observed. The whole
          illustrated by notes from the most ancient Jewish writings. By
          John Gill, D.D., 9 vols. fo., London, 1748-63; 9 vols. 4to,
          London, 1809. Gill gives a summary of each chapter. Orme says of
          him, "Had Dr. Gill fulfilled the promise of his title page, no
          other commentary on the Bible could have been required. But he
          moves through his exposition like a man in lead, and overwhelms
          the inspired writers with dull lucubrations and rabbinical
          lumber. He is an ultra-Calvinist in his doctrinal sentiments;
          and often spiritualizes the text to absurdity. If the reader be
          inclined for a trial of his strength and patience, he may
          procure the burden of Dr. Gill. He was, after all, a man of
          undoubted learning, and of prodigious labour."--A very popular
          work was an English translation of Jean Frédéric Osterwald's
          Argumens et réflexions sur l'écriture sainte (Neuchâtel, 1709-15
          and often; see [351]Osterwald, Jean Frédéric), which appeared
          under the title, The Arguments of the Books and Chapters of the
          Old and New Testaments, with practical observations. Translated
          by John Chamberlayne, Esq., London, 1749, 3 vols.; fifth
          edition, enlarged, 2 vols., London, 1779.

    7. Various Works After 1750.

          Chamberlayne's work was followed by A New and Literal
          Translation of all the Books of the Old and New Testaments, with
          Notes critical and explanatory. By Anthony Purver (2 vols.,
          London, 1764). Purver was a Quaker and originally a shoemaker.
          He taught himself Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, in order that he
          might understand the Bible. His work is often ungrammatical, and
          unintelligible; the notes are very similar to the text and, what
          is worse, full of pride and ill-nature. Notwithstanding these
          defects, Purver sometimes gives a better rendering than occurs
          in the Authorized Version.--One year later appeared The
          Evangelical Expositor; or a Commentary on the Holy Bible,
          wherein the Sacred Text is inserted at large, the sense
          explained, and different passages elucidated, with practical
          observations, etc. By T. Haweis, LL.B., M.D., London, 1765, 2
          vols.; Glasgow, 3 vols. 4to, and various editions. Haweis (d.
          1820) was rector of Aldwinkle, Northamptonshire; his work had
          little value.--Next to be mentioned is The Complete Family
          Bible: or a Spiritual Exposition of the Old and New Testament;
          wherein each chapter is summed up in its context, and the sacred
          text inserted at large, with Notes, spiritual, practical, and
          explanatory. By the Rev. Mr. Cruden, London, 1770, 2 vols.--In
          the same year appeared a similar work under the title, A
          Commentary on the Books of Old and New Testaments, in which, are
          inserted the Notes and Collections of John Locke, Esq., Daniel
          Waterland, D.D., and the Right Hon. Edward, Earl of Clarendon,
          and other learned persons, with practical improvements. By W.
          Dodd, LL.D., London, 1770, 3 vols. This is mostly a compilation,
          the chief value of which consists in notes furnished from the
          original papers of John Locke, Dr. Waterland, Lord Clarendon,
          Gilbert West, and some others. Great use is also made of some of
          the printed and long-established commentaries on Scripture, such
          as Calmet, Houbigant, and Doddridge. Adam Clarke said, rather
          hyperbolically, that it was on the whole by far the best comment
          that had yet appeared in the English language--The next work to
          be mentioned is The Self-Interpreting Bible, containing the Old
          and the New Testaments, to which are annexed an . . .
          introduction, marginal references and illustrations . . .
          explanatory notes . . . etc., etc. By the late Rev. John Brown,
          Minister of the Gospel at Haddington, London, 1778, 2 vols. It
          was repeatedly reprinted, and proved almost as popular south as
          north of the Tweed.--Henry Southwell published a Bible,
          Authorized Version; with notes etc.; wherein the
          mis-translations are corrected, London, 1782.--Another work of a
          similar character is The Holy Bible, containing the Books of the
          Old and New Testaments, carefully printed from the fatal edition
          (compared with others) of the present translation; with notes by
          Thomas Wilson, D.D., Bishop of Sodor and Man, and various
          renderings, collected from other translations, by the Rev.
          Clement Crutwell, editor, London, 1785, 8 vols. Bishop Wilson's
          notes are merely brief hints either for the explanation or the
          practical improvement of particular passages. Dr. Thomas Paris,
          in the Cambridge bible of 1762, and Dr. B. Blayney, in the
          Oxford Bible of 1769, added considerably to the number of
          marginal notes and references.

    8. Thomas Scott and Others to 1810.

          But far more popular than any of the works already mentioned was
          the Bible with commentary edited by [352]Rev. Thomas Scott. It
          had the largest circulation and sustained it through many years.
          It appeared under the title, The Holy Bible, containing the Old
          and New Testaments; with original notes, practical observations,
          and copious marginal references. By Thomas Scott, Rector of
          Aston Sandford (London, 1788, and often). As a commentary Dr.
          Scott's work was superior to any that had appeared before its
          time. Horne, usually a discriminating judge, speaks of it in
          high praise (cf. his Manual of Biblical Bibliography, London,
          1839, p. 259).--In 1799 appeared A Revised Translation and
          Interpretation of the Sacred Scriptures, after the Eastern
          manner, from concurrent authorities of critics, interpreters,
          and commentators' copies and versions; shewing that the inspired
          writings contain the seeds of the valuable sciences, being the
          source whence the antient philosophers derived them, also the
          most antient histories and greatest antiquities, and are the
          most entertaining as well as instructing to both the curious and
          serious (by David Macrae, or J. M. Ray, J. McRay, or D. McRae;
          Glasgow, 1799; 2d ed., 1815; 4to, also in 3 vols. 8vo.). The
          author introduced many approved renderings, but marred the
          simplicity and dignity of the Authorized Version.--Another
          noteworthy annotated Bible is that of John Reeves, which
          appeared in ten volumes in London, 1802. The explanatory notes
          are based on Wells's Paraphrase, and the commentaries of
          Patrick, Lowth, Whitby, and others. A similar work was the
          so-called "Reformers' Bible," The Holy Bible, containing the Old
          and New Testaments, according to the Authorized Version, with
          short Notes by several learned and pious Reformers, as printed
          by Royal Authority at the time of the Reformation, with
          additional Notes and Dissertations, London, 1810. The notes in
          the Old Testament in this edition are taken from the Geneva
          Bible, the annotations of the New Testament from the Latin of
          Theodore Beza.

    9. Adam Clarke, d'Oyly and Mant, and Bellamy, 1810-34.

          Also in 1810 there began to be published The Holy Bible,
          containing the Old and New Testaments: the Text carefully
          printed from the most correct copies of the present authorized
          translation, including the marginal readings and parallel texts;
          with a Commentary, and Critical Notes, designed as a help to a
          better understanding of the Sacred Writings. By Adam Clarke,
          LL.D., F.A.S., London, 1810-26. The author, a Wesleyan minister
          (see [353]Clarke, Adam), attained a high reputation as a student
          of Oriental languages. The scope of the commentary is expressed
          in its own words: "In this work the whole of the text has been
          collated with the Hebrew and Greek originals, and all the
          ancient versions; the most difficult words analyzed and
          explained; the most important readings in the Hebrew collections
          of Kennicott and De Rossi on the Old Testament, and in those of
          Mill, Wetstein, and Griesbach on the New, are noticed; the date
          of every transaction, as far as it has been ascertained by the
          best chronologers, is marked; the peculiar customs of the Jews
          and neighboring nations, so frequently alluded to by the
          prophets, evangelists, and apostles, are explained from the best
          Asiatic authorities; the great doctrines of the Law and Gospel
          of God are defined, illustrated, and defended; and the whole is
          applied to the important purposes of practical Christianity." A
          considerable popularity was achieved also by d'Oyly and Mant's
          commentary, The Holy Bible according to the Authorized Version,
          with Notes explanatory and practical, taken principally from the
          most eminent writers of the United Church of England and
          Ireland; together with appropriate introductions, tables,
          indexes, maps, and plans, prepared and arranged by the Rev. G.
          d'Oyly, B.D., and Rev. Richard Mant, D.D., Oxford and London,
          1814, 3 vols., and various subsequent editions printed at
          Cambridge and Oxford. "This work, which was published under the
          sanction of the venerable Society for Promoting Christian
          Knowledge, professes to communicate only the results of the
          critical inquiries of learned men, without giving a detailed
          exposition of the inquiries themselves. These results, however,
          are selected with great judgment, so that the reader who may
          consult them on difficult passages will rarely be disappointed.
          Of the labour attending this publication some idea may be
          formed, when it is stated that the works of upward of one
          hundred and sixty authors have been consulted for it, amounting
          to several hundred volumes. On the fundamental articles of
          Christian verity--the Deity and atonement of Jesus Christ, and
          the personality and offices of the Holy Spirit--this work may be
          pronounced to be a library of divinity" (Horne, ut sup., pp.
          261-262).--A work of a similar character was The Holy Bible,
          newly translated from the original Hebrew, with Notes critical
          and explanatory. By John Bellamy, London, 1818-34. Orme
          considers it a strange hodgepodge of error, confidence,
          misrepresentation, and abuse of learned and valuable writers in
          all the departments of Biblical literature.

    10. Other Works 1818-38.

          Rev. B. Boothroyd edited A New Family Bible, and Improved
          Version, from corrected Texts of the Originals, with Notes
          critical and explanatory; and short Practical Reflections on
          each Chapter, Pontefract and London, 1818-23, 3 vols. The author
          has very happily blended critical disquisition with practical
          instruction, and an invariable regard to the spirit and design
          of revelation.--In 1821 there appeared The Plain Reader's Help
          in the Study of the Holy Scriptures; consisting of Notes,
          explanatory and illustrative, chiefly selected or abridged from
          the Family Bible, published by the Society for Promoting
          Christian Knowledge. By the Rev. William Thomas Bree, M.A.,
          Coventry, 1821-22. The aim was to supply brief and untechnical
          notes at a moderate price for readers who could not procure or
          consult larger works.--In 1824 appeared The Holy Bible, arranged
          and adapted for family reading, with notes, etc. by a Layman of
          the Church of England (2 vols., London).--Another popular Bible
          was the so-called Cottage Bible and Family Expositor; containing
          the Authorized Translation of the Old and New Testaments, with
          Practical Reflections and short Explanatory Notes, calculated to
          elucidate difficult and obscure Passages. By Thomas Williams,
          London, 1825-27, 3 vols., and various subsequent editions. This
          unassuming but cheap and useful commentary on the Holy
          Scriptures was professedly designed for persons and families in
          the humbler walks of life.--There is also to be mentioned The
          Comprehensive Bible; containing the Old and New Testaments,
          according to the Authorized Version, with the various readings
          and marginal notes usually printed therewith; a general
          introduction, containing disquisitions on the genuineness,
          authenticity, and inspiration of the Holy Scriptures,--various
          divisions and marks of distinction in the sacred
          Writings,--ancient versions,--coins, weights, and
          measures,--various sects among the Jews: introductions and
          concluding remarks to each book; the parallel passages contained
          in the Rev. J. Scott's Commentary, Canne's Bible, Rev. J.
          Brown's Self-Interpreting Bible, Dr. A. Clarke's Commentary, and
          the English Version of the Polyglott Bible systematically
          arranged; philological arid explanatory notes. With
          chronological and other indexes (by William Greenfield, London,
          1827).--In 1828 there was published The Holy Bible . . .
          principally designed to facilitate the audible or social reading
          of the Sacred Scriptures; illustrated with notes, historical,
          geographical, and otherwise explanatory, and also pointing out
          the fulfilment of various prophecies. By William Alexander--vol.
          i--the Pentateuch--York, 1828; two other volumes were planned
          but did not appear). This Bible owed its origin to efforts of
          members of the Society of Friends. Passages "unsuitable for a
          mixed audience" were printed in italics below the text.--C.
          Girdlestone edited The Old and New Testament, with a commentary,
          consisting of short lectures for the daily use of families,
          London, 1835-42.--Another Bible of the same style was the
          Treasury Bible. First division: containing the authorized
          English Version of the Holy Scriptures, as printed in Bagster's
          Polyglott Bible, with the same copious and original selection of
          references to parallel and illustrative passages, and similarly
          printed in a centre column. Second division: containing the
          Treasury of Scripture Knowledge, consisting of a rich and
          copious assemblage of upwards of five hundred thousand parallel
          texts, from Canne, Brown, Blayney, Scott, and others, with
          numerous illustrative notes, London, 1835.--In 1837 there was
          published The Condensed Commentary and Family Exposition of the
          Holy Bible: containing the best criticisms of the most valuable
          Biblical Writers, with practical reflections and marginal
          references; chronology, indexes, etc., etc. By the Rev. Ingram
          Cobbin, M.A., London, 1837. This work is literally a condensed
          commentary, derived from the best accessible sources. The notes
          are brief, but well chosen, and are partly critical and
          explanatory, partly practical. They are taken from nearly two
          hundred writers, British and foreign.--Another annotated Bible
          was edited by the Rev. C. Wellbeloved, The Holy Bible, a New
          Translation, with introductory remarks, notes explanatory and
          critical, and practical, reflections, 2 vols., London, 1838. It
          is Unitarian and designed principally for the use of families.

          The standard English version of the Roman Catholics (the "Douai"
          Bible; see [354]Bible Versions, B, IV, § 5), was provided with
          notes setting forth and defending the Roman standpoint. The
          later annotated English Bibles of the Catholics are based
          chiefly upon these notes. [355]Richard Challoner and George Leo
          Haydock (The Holy Bible, 2 vols., Manchester, 1811-14; revised
          Reims and Douai text with extensive notes) are well-known Roman
          Catholic annotators. Most of the "minor versions" enumerated in
          § 8 of the article on English versions ([356]Bible Versions, B,
          IV) are annotated.

    11. Republication in America.

          The popular works of England were reissued in America. The first
          American edition of Scott's commentary was printed and published
          by W. Woodward of Philadelphia in 1804 in 4 vols. Other issues
          followed by different publishers, most of them from the press of
          Woodward of Philadelphia, and that of Samuel T. Armstrong of
          Boston. The most popular form of the book was an octavo of six
          volumes. Scott's Bible had a continuous sale for more than forty
          years, and as late as 1841 W. E. Dean, 2 Ann Street, New York,
          published an edition in three volumes.--Adam Clarke's commentary
          was published by Ezra Sargeant, 86 Broadway, New York, in
          1811.--Osterwald's Observations appeared in 1813 with this
          imprint: "New York: Published by Evert Duyckinck, John Tiebout,
          G. & R. Waite, and Websters & Skinners of Albany, George Long,
          Printer."--The first American edition of Matthew Henry's
          Exposition appeared in Philadelphia in 1816, published by Towar
          and Hogan in six volumes. They also issued a stereotyped edition
          in three volumes in 1829. Burder and Hughes of the same city
          issued a six volume edition in 1828, with preface by Archibald
          Alexander.--D'Oyly and Mant's Bible with commentary was
          reprinted in New York in 1818-20 by T. and J. Swords, 160 Pearl
          Street. This edition has additional notes from the pen of the
          Rt. Rev. John H. Hobart, D.D., bishop of New York, who quotes
          from a large number of Biblical scholars, mainly in the
          Anglican, Scottish, and American Episcopal Churches, who had not
          been noticed by the English editors.--Thomas Williams's Cottage
          Bible, reedited by the Rev. William Patton, was printed in two
          octavo volumes by Conner & Cooke, New York, in 1833. It contains
          numerous engravings and several maps, and was intended chiefly
          for the use of Sunday-schools and Bible-classes. The plates were
          sold by the New York printers, and in after-years the editions
          were issued at Hartford, Conn.--Greenfield's Comprehensive Bible
          was issued in 1839 with the imprint of "Robinson & Franklin,
          successors to Leavitt, Lord & Co., 180 Broadway." The book is a
          thick quarto of 1,460 pages. The American issue was also
          published by Lippincott, Gambo & Co., Philadelphia, in 1854, and
          by J. B. Lippincott & Co. in 1857. Canne's marginal notes and
          references appeared in many editions of American household and
          family Bibles, and John Brown's Self-Interpreting Bible was
          frequently reproduced. The American Tract Society early
          published a family Bible with brief notes and instructions and
          many editions were printed. Eugene Cummiskey, of Philadelphia,
          published various editions for Roman Catholics, such as The Holy
          Bible, translated from the Latin Vulgate, with annotations,
          references, etc. Isaiah Thomas, the famous author of the History
          of Printing in America, published and sold the Authorized
          Version with notes at his press in Worcester Mass.; various
          editions appeared after 1791.

    12. Original American Works.

          One of the earliest productions of the Philadelphia press was
          The Christian's New and Complete Family Bible, published by
          William Woodhouse in 1790. It was issued in numbers, and the
          Rev. Paul Wright, D.D., vicar of Oakley, is supposed to have
          been the editor.--The Columbian Family and Pulpit Bible bears
          the imprint, "Boston: Published by Joseph Teal, printed by J. H.
          A. Frost, opposite U. S. Bank, Congress Street, 1822." It claims
          to be a "corrected and improved American edition of the Popular
          English Family Bible," supplied "with concise notes and
          annotations, theological, historical, chronological, critical,
          practical, moral, and explanatory"; also containing "sundry
          important received various readings from the most ancient Hebrew
          and Greek manuscripts and the most celebrated versions of
          Scripture. Also, sundry corrections and improvements of our
          excellent English version (generally admitted by learned
          Christians of every name) with references to authors, versions,
          and manuscripts; also, an illustrative argument prefixed to each
          sacred book or epistle, from the best authorities." The volume
          is a folio, embellished with thirty-six engravings. The book was
          issued in numbers and had more than three thousand subscribers.
          The Rev. Jonathan Homer, D.D., of Newton, Mass., revised the
          observations, and condensed some of the notes and enlarged
          others.--In 1826 The Collateral Bible made its appearance with
          the following imprint: "Philadelphia: Printed by Samuel F.
          Bradford, and by E. Bliss and E. White, New York. J. Harding,
          Printer, 1826." This book was edited by William McCorkle,
          assisted by the Rev. Ezra Stiles Ely, D.D., a Presbyterian
          minister, and the Rev. Gregory T. Bedell, A.M., rector of St.
          Andrew's Church, Philadelphia. "In this work the best marginal
          references are printed at large, and in connection with every
          passage, by which means every parallel or related phrase in the
          sacred volume is brought at once under the eye, so as to present
          the whole scope and subject of every text at a single view"
          (Horne, Biblical Bibliography, p. 86). The three volumes
          comprised only the Old Testament, and the New Testament part was
          never attempted.--The Devotional Family Bible was edited by the
          Rev. Alexander Fletcher, D.D., "with practical and experimental
          reflections on each verse of the Old and New Testaments, and
          rich marginal references." An edition in quarto with fifty-seven
          illustrations was published with this imprint: "London and New
          York: Virtue, Emmins and Company." The title-page has no date,
          though O'Callaghan assigns the publication to the year 1835.

    13. Later Works, English and American.

          Of more modern works of a similar character the following may be
          mentioned: the Lange commentary, translated and edited, with
          additions, by Philip Schaff and others (25 vols., New York,
          1866-88); the work commonly known as the "Speaker's Commentary"
          (because suggested by the Right Hon. J. Evelyn Denison, speaker
          of the House of Commons), ed. F. C. Cook (10 vols., London,
          1871-81); the Cambridge Bible for Schools and Colleges, ed. J.
          J. S. Perowne (48 vols., Cambridge, 1877 sqq.); Bishop
          Ellicott's Commentary for English Readers (8 vols., London,
          1877-84); J. H. Blunts Annotated Bible . . . a Household
          Commentary on the Holy Scriptures (3 vols., London, 1878);
          Clark's Handbooks far Bible Classes, ed. M. Dods and A. Whyte
          (47 vols., Edinburgh, 1879 sqq.); the American Commentary
          (Baptist; N. T. complete, ed. Alvah Hovey, 7 vols., O. T., 4
          vols.--Lev. and Num., Job, Eccles., Prov. and Song of
          Songs--published at present, 1881 sqq.); the International
          Illustrated Commentary on the New Testament, ed. Philip Schaff
          (4 vols., New York, 1889); J. G. Butler, Bible Work (11 vols.,
          1892); the New Century Bible, ed. W. F. Adeney (N. T. complete,
          13 vols.; O. T., 10 vols. issued, London, 1901 sqq.); and the
          Temple Bible (31 vols., London, 1901-03; especially useful for
          reading because the text is paragraphed according to the sense,
          and chapter and verse divisions are relegated to the margin).
          The so-called "Teachers' Bibles," of which many were published
          during the last quarter of the nineteenth century, may also be
          mentioned.

   Bibles for Children
          BIBLES FOR CHILDREN: Various attempts have been made to present
          the Bible in the form of a "child's book." The selection of
          parts best adapted to immature minds and the omission of the
          unsuitable, with simplification of language, are the chief aims
          in such attempts. Illustrations, coarse print, and other
          typographical devices are naturally used freely. Such books
          spring from the conviction that the Bible contains spiritual
          truth for all and is the greatest instrument for awakening
          religious feeling and quickening moral perception, but that its
          usefulness for these ends is necessarily conditioned upon the
          form of presentation and that the latter may well be varied for
          different classes of readers. The following list mentions some
          noteworthy books of this sort in English, but makes no claim to
          completeness.

          An Abridgement of the Holy Scriptures. By the Rev. Mr. Sellon,
          late Minister of St. James's, Clerkenwell, published in 1781 and
          many later eds., at Hartford by Hale and Hosmer, 1813.

          The Bible for Children. Arranged from the King James Version.
          With a Preface by the Rev. Francis Brown, D.D., and an

          ed., 1882.

          The Children's Bible, or an History of the Holy Scriptures to

          Transcript of the received Text: Intended for the use of
          Families, but more particularly as a Reading Book for Schools.
          By Rodolphus Dickinson, Esq., . . . Greenfield, Mass., Horace
          Graves, Printer, 1814.

          A curious Hieroglyphick Bible, or Select Passages in the Old and
          New Testaments, represented with emblematical figures, for the
          amusement of youth; designed chiefly to familiarize tender age,
          in a pleasing and diverting manner, with early ideas of the Holy
          Scriptures--a very popular work which appeared in many editions
          (12th ed., London, 1792; Worcester, Mass., Isaiah Thomas, 1788;
          Dublin, 1789; etc.). It is a child's book, containing short
          passages of Scripture in which some of the words are represented
          by small cuts.

          The Holy Bible abridged: or the History of the Old and New
          Testament. Illustrated with Notes, and adorned with cuts. For
          the Use of Children. To which is added, A Compleat Abstract of

          of children, and rearranges the matter."

          The Bible for Young People, New York, 1902, n. e., 1906.

          Scripture Lessons for schools on the British system of mutual
          instruction. Adopted in Russia by order of the Emperor Alexander
          I., London, 1820. According to the preface, these selections
          were originally made in Russian at St. Petersburg in 1818-19,
          and adopted in Russian schools at the instance of Prince
          Alexander Galitzin, minister of instruction. The Committee of
          the British and Foreign School Society then determined to issue

   Bibles, Historical (Story-bibles)
          BIBLES, HISTORICAL (STORY-BIBLES): The usual term applied to a
          compilation of Holy Scripture which, confining itself chiefly to
          the historical portions, adapts them to educational purposes.
          This may be done either by a faithful repetition of the Biblical
          narratives or by thoroughgoing changes in the selection of the
          material, by the representation of facts, and by devotional
          application. In this article the term is confined to certain
          medieval works which, written in the language of the people and
          in popular style, constituted in their time the chief literary
          media for disseminating the knowledge of Bible history.

    The Earliest Story-Bibles.

          It is an interesting fact that the historico-devotional mode of
          considering the Bible received attention only when the people
          themselves began their spiritual and religious emancipation. As
          soon as the vernacular was allowed to become the language of
          religious instruction, among the Anglo-Saxons and in Germany at
          the time of Charlemagne, literary phenomena appear which at
          least to a certain extent fall under the conception of
          Story-Bibles. It is said that the poetical productions of
          [357]Cædmon in their original form treated the whole Bible
          history to the day of judgment; in the Krist of [358]Otfrid of
          Weissenburg and in the Low Saxon [359]Heliand not only was
          sacred history given in poetical form, but in picturesqueness
          and minuteness of details it appealed directly to the spirit of
          the people. Several other Story-Bibles in poetical form were
          subsequently composed, especially in Germany; among them the
          work of [360]Rudolf of Ems seems to have become most popular. In
          the Biblical literature of Holland may be mentioned the "Riming
          Bible" of Jacob of Maerlant. Much older are the poetical
          compilations of Biblical history in the French language,
          especially that of Herman of Valenciennes and the popular Roman
          de S. Fanuel which piquantly interweaves evangelical history
          with apocryphal and miraculous stories. Compilations in prose
          were also written; it may be said, however, that the strictly
          literal method of translation made slow progress and fully
          asserted itself only at the time of the Reformation. It is
          strange that the history of the Old Testament was treated more
          frequently than that of the New Testament; probably, being the
          older and more unknown record, it was better adapted for a free
          compilation.

    Their Character and Sources.

          The space devoted to Genesis was large in proportion to that
          given to the other books of the Old Testament. At times an
          attempt was made to insert in chronological order the few facts
          known of secular history. As to the sources, many legendary
          elements from older times may have been incorporated from
          popular tradition. But most of these works presuppose a written
          source. The material, so far as it can not be traced immediately
          to the Vulgate, may easily be found in the popular collection of
          glosses of Walafrid Strabo or in the historical works of Vincent
          of Beauvais, of Gottfrid of Viterbo, and others. Moreover, later
          Story-Bibles used earlier works of the same nature. Thus the
          Historia scholastica of [361]Peter Comestor was the source of
          several German and French works. Similarly, poetical works
          became the sources of works in prose. A popular Story-Bible of
          Germany may be traced to the poetical production of Rudolf of
          Ems, and French literature possesses prose compilations of older
          riming Bibles; even in the Quatre Livres des rois of the twelfth
          century there are found occasional rimes or even larger passages
          in verse, all of which clearly show that the original form of
          the Biblical story in popular literature was poetic. It was only
          gradually that higher theological education found its way back
          to the Bible text in its proper form.

          In Spain originated the Historia general, under the influence of
          King Alfonso the Wise (1252-84). He entrusted to certain
          scholars the task of writing a great collective work on the
          basis of the Historia scholastica of Peter Comestor, in which
          the whole history of the world should be represented in the
          framework of the Biblical stories with the addition of extensive
          portions from secular history.

          There is a distinction between the French expressions bibles
          historiées and bibles historiales. Histoire in Old French means
          "picture," because to people of no education history in the form
          of pictures was most easily available. Hence bible historiée
          means "illustrated Bible" (see [362]Bibles, Illustrated), while
          bible historiale denotes "Story-Bible." Bibles historiales are,
          then, the works treated above. Of this sort was the translation
          of the Historia scholastica of Peter Comestor into the dialect
          of Picard by Guyard des Moulins, canon of Aire in Artois (1295),
          a work which, in connection with a literal translation of the
          Bible dating from the thirteenth century, formed for hundreds of
          years one of the most popular Story-Bibles (see [363]Bible
          Versions, B, VI, § 2).

          It was reserved for the Reformation to place in the hands of
          Christian people the whole Bible according to the original
          texts, without glosses and additions, and thus with the
          beginning of that period the Story-Bible had fulfilled its
          mission.

    1. Illustrated Manuscripts, Roman and Byzantine.

          The history of illustration goes back beyond the Christian era;
          the ancients adorned manuscripts of Homer, Vergil, and Livy with
          drawings and richly painted designs, and illustrations were
          introduced for educational purposes into the works of Vitruvius
          on architecture, Aratus on astrology, and Vegetius on the art of
          war. In like manner, from the time of Constantine and probably
          earlier, illustration was applied to manuscripts of the Bible.
          Presumably to this decoration may be referred what Jerome and
          Chrysostom say in reprobation of the luxury which people allowed
          themselves in the ornamentation of the Scriptures. The high
          veneration paid to the Bible explains the zeal with which
          miniature-painting was pursued in the early Church. The extant
          illustrated manuscripts do not apparently go further back than
          the fourth century (the fragment of Genesis in the Vienna
          library; the Vatican Joshua; the evangeliarium of Rossano; and a
          Syriac evangeliarium of 586 in the Laurentian library at
          Florence). In these many features, such as the architecture,
          costume, action, the introduction of allegorical figures and
          personifications, indicate the nature of the scene or its
          locality, which are derived from ancient art and reveal the
          prevalence of a good tradition. Among them are small pictures
          executed in body-colors with idyllic artistic feeling, after the
          manner of the older mural painting. The miniatures of the Vienna
          Genesis are still partly in the purely illusionist style which
          had been dominant since the Flavian period, like the paintings
          in the Baths of Constantine; but the greater part of them are in
          a style specially adapted to book illustration, more a
          draftsman's than a painter's. They exhibit the continued
          influence of the narrative art of the Roman empire in the second
          and third centuries, as shown in the pictures from the Odyssey
          on the Esquiline, on Roman sarcophagi, and in the pictures of
          Philostratus; this defined the specific style of all Christian
          compositions until the sixteenth century. The illustrations of
          the Paris Psalter and other manuscripts which may be assigned to
          the end of the fourth century are characteristic of the end of
          Greek and the beginning of Roman painting. The Joshua continues
          the Roman triumphal style, with strong affinity to the reliefs
          of Trajan's Column. In the Byzantine empire the influence of the
          ancient civilization was long felt; but a more ornamental
          tendency came in with the iconoclastic controversy. It is true
          there are some illustrations of the ninth and tenth centuries, a
          psalter and a commentary on Isaiah in the Vatican, another
          psalter and the sermons of Gregory Nazianzen in the Bibliothèque
          Nationale at Paris, which are worthy to stand by the side of the
          early Christian specimens; but as a rule the drawing grows
          harder and stiffer. Ornamentation, on the other hand, is richer;
          the gold ground becomes more usual, the initial letters are made
          prominent, and the ornamental borders are more noteworthy.
          Mosaic and enamel painting set the style for the miniatures as
          well. The standard of Byzantine painting is laid down in the
          Mount Athos "Guide to Painting" (1458; translated into German by
          G. Schäfer, Treves, 1855). The development of illustration in
          the West was altogether different. Here, too, the influence of
          the early Christian tradition was operative; but the entrance of
          the Teutonic nations into the Church brought new impulses and
          new problems. They were, indeed, barbarians, without any native
          artistic style; but they brought with them a joyous power of
          accomplishment, a feeling for nature, and a bold love of truth
          which had far-reaching effects.

    2. Teutonic and Celtic Manuscripts.

          The Roman tradition continued among the Lombards and the Franks;
          but art became ruder and less refined. In the early Christian
          and Byzantine manuscripts the decoration had been usually
          confined to the addition of pictures; the Teutonic peoples
          extended it to the text itself. The initials are almost buried
          in bright colors and elaborate decoration, the leaves framed in
          colored designs. The scribe was often the painter. These
          characteristics appear plainly in the Irish manuscripts--the
          "Book of Kells" at Trinity College, Dublin, and those of
          Würzburg, Treves, and St. Gall. The influence of Gregory the
          Great helped to preserve the early Christian traditions among
          the Anglo-Saxons and Franks until within the Carolingian period
          (the Purple Gospel in the British Museum and an evangeliarium at
          Cambridge, seventh century). An independent conception comes out
          first in the illustrations proper, without any feeling for
          perspective, but with an attractive effort to attain truth and
          naturalness (Ashburnham Pentateuch, seventh century). Under the
          Carolingians great schools were founded for artistic copying of
          manuscripts at Tours, Orléans, Metz, Reichenau, St. Gall,
          Treves, etc. Their work was connected with the old tradition by
          its sober-minded simplicity and its careful technique
          (evangeliarium of Godescalc, Paris; another at Vienna; another
          of St. Médard, 826, at Soissons; another of King Lothair, 843,
          and the Bible of Charles the Bald, 850, both in Paris). In the
          provinces the development, though less beautiful, was more
          independent (Bible of Alcuin, British Museum). Here the
          draftsman takes precedence of the painter, but the work is
          marked by originality and poetic imagination and power (Utrecht
          Psalter, ninth century; a benedictionale at Chatsworth;
          evangeliaria of Otto I at Aix-la-Chapelle, of Egbert at Treves,
          c. 980, of Echternach at Gotha, c. 990, and of Otto III at
          Aix-la-Chapelle). Then the decoration becomes gradually more
          elaborate, the pictorial and ornamental parts begin to
          interchange their qualities, the initiate and borders are rich
          and gay.

    3. Manuscripts of the Eleventh Century.

          In the eleventh century the Cluniac mood of struggle and
          renunciation prevails; the spiritual excitement and vivid fancy
          of the time are shown in the Bible-illustrations; wasted forms
          in stiff garments set forth the ascetic ideal of their creators;
          truth to nature disappears entirely. And yet there is great
          progress in every domain of the intellectual life-it is the age
          of Bernard. Even in the miniatures there are signs of the
          awakening of the individual life; beneath all the passion and
          combat there are a quiet melancholy and longing for peace. Henry
          II endowed his Bamberg foundations with beautifully painted
          books, and at Hildesheim an important scriptorium, influential
          throughout the north of Europe, was founded by Bernward, himself
          a pioneer in painting. Here the forms are hard and traditional,
          but the content is new and full of deep and animated feeling.
          After the rise of general civilization under the Hohenstaufens,
          the bars of form were to a great extent broken down. The joy of
          living came back, and led the imagination once more into the
          comprehension of beautiful things, both graceful and dignified.
          There is a better feeling for outline, and the study of the
          heritage of antiquity seems to revive. The Bruchsal
          evangeliarium at Carlsruhe shows surprisingly good drawing and
          natural movement, as does another of about 1200 in the cathedral
          library at Treves; best of all is that of Henry the Lion,
          formerly in the cathedral treasury at Prague but now in the
          possession of the Duke of Cumberland, and the Merseburg Vulgate.
          A brilliant period for miniature-painting was opening; but its
          tone was characterized rather by breadth than by depth, and the
          more popular it became, the more the profound symbolism of the
          early times disappeared. Illustration was now bestowed less on
          Bibles than on books used in public worship, until at the end of
          the Middle Ages artistic interest once more covered the whole
          Bible; but new life really came into this branch of illustration
          with the invention of wood-engraving.

    4. Biblia Pauperum.

          The transition to illustrated Bibles for the people is seen in
          the Biblia pauperum of the thirteenth and fourteenth
          centuries--short representations of the earthly life of Christ
          in simple drawings, generally uncolored, ranging in number from
          thirty-four to fifty. Each event depicted is accompanied by two
          antitypes from the Old Testament and by four prophets with
          appropriate citations, and the pictures are explained in Latin
          or in German. The most important examples of these "Bibles of
          the Poor" are those of St. Florian in Lower Austria, of the
          Lyceum library at Constance, in the Vienna and Munich libraries
          [and in the ducal library at Wolfenbüttel].

    5. Illustrated Bibles of the Reformation and Later.

          With the invention of printing and engraving, especially
          wood-engraving, both the Bible and art became common property.
          Reproductions of the Biblia pauperum, which now first became
          really accessible to the "poor," are among the most celebrated
          of early block books. The German Bibles before Luther (Augsburg
          1477, Cologne c. 1480, Nuremberg 1483, Lübeck 1494) have
          woodcuts. Finally Dürer, with the wonderful vision which could
          realize even the majestic pictures of the Apocalypse, teased
          Biblical illustration to its highest dignity. With the
          vernacular text, eagerly sought after as it was, a great variety
          of illustrations went hand in hand. Luther recognized their
          importance to the Reformation cause and promoted illustration
          zealously, and Melanchthon drew rough sketches, which he gave to
          Lucas Cranach for execution. Bible-illustration has never had
          such a vogue as in the first half of the sixteenth century. The
          most splendid edition was published by Krafft of Wittenberg in
          1576 and 1584. With Bibles of the middle of the century Biblical
          illustrating took a new direction, when line-engraving gradually
          forced wood-engraving into the background. The latter was used
          mainly for cheap popular editions, while artistic tendencies
          were mainly displayed by the former. In 1607 the fifty-two
          pictures from the logge of the Vatican, the so-called Raffael
          Bible, engraved by Badalocchio and Lanfranco, were published,
          followed by another important series of line-engravings, the
          Icones biblicæ and Historiæ sacræ published by Merian at
          Frankfort, 1625-27, and a long list of similar works in Germany,
          France, and Italy. In the eighteenth century wood-engraving
          almost entirely died out, except for cheap ephemeral
          productions, while line-engraving flourished in the hands of the
          Dutch school, who shared the renown of the French. German art
          was mainly imitative, and produced little that is noteworthy in
          Biblical illustration. Good editions, on the other hand, were
          published during this period in Holland by Mortier, 1700;
          Danckers, 1700; Luyken, 1740; Schots, 1749. In France the best
          were those of Basnage, 1705, and Martin, 1724. In England,
          besides the Oxford Bible of 1717, there were the editions of
          Royaumont, 1705; Clarke, 1759; and Fleetwood, 1769. In all these
          the Dutch-Flemish spirit appears, with its wide, free, joyous
          life; the fundamental principles of illustration are based on
          imitation of painting; Rubens, and Rembrandt for etching, are
          the highest authorities. In the nineteenth century
          Bible-illustration took a new impulse from England. The modern
          romantic manner and straining after effect entered into it,
          largely as a result of the great Holy Bible with Engravings from
          Pictures and Designs by the most Eminent Artists, published in
          London, 1800. [This, however, had been anticipated by the
          Historical Part of the Holy Bible with illustrations engraved by
          John Cole (London, 1730) and a volume with the same title
          illustrated by John Sturt, as well as by the James Tittler Bible
          (4 vols., 1794-95). It was followed by a series of efforts, such
          as the Pictorial Bible by Charles Knight, with woodcuts (London,
          1828-29, New York, 1843), another of the same name, but with
          steel engravings (London, 1847-49), a numerous series of Bible
          Picture Books issued by the Society for Promoting Christian
          Knowledge and the Religious Tract Society, and Bible
          Illustrations, issued by Frowde (London, 1896).]

    6. The Nineteenth Century.

          The interest in the Orient which came up with Napoleon's
          Egyptian campaign, in alliance with the strong realistic
          tendency of the century, brought in a wholly new sort of
          illustrated Bible, like Brown's Family Bible (London and New
          York), with views of towns and landscapes in addition to
          historical pictures. Later, wood-engraving revived reached once
          more an unexpected height of excellence, and succeeded in
          getting in touch with the great masses of the people. Notable
          products of this revival (in Germany) were Oliver's Bible of
          1834; Overbeck's forty fine illustrations to the New Testament
          (1841); the Cotta edition of 1850, with 175 wood-engravings
          after the first artists of Germany; and, best of all the German
          editions, that published by Wigand (Leipsic, 1852-1860), with
          240 illustrations by Julius Schnorr von Carolsfeld (Eng. ed.,
          Leipsic, 1855-60; London, 1869). The technically brilliant but
          too theatrical designs of Doré won great popularity. The Germans
          have recently published several noteworthy editions, such as the
          "Pfeilstücker Bible" in 1887, with many explanatory
          archeological drawings, and the "Star Bible" published by
          Hinrichs (Leipsic) in 1892, with reproductions of classical
          pictures for the Old Testament and Hofmann's for the New. [One
          of the latest attempts at Biblical illustration is the work of
          the French artist J. J. J. Tissot (d. 1902), who, during s ten
          years' residence in Palestine, prepared a series of sketches
          based upon study of the Biblical places and environment. The
          Life of our Lord Jesus Christ, with 365 compositions in color

   Bibles, Polyglot

  BIBLES, POLYGLOT.

          I. The Complutensian Polyglot.

          II. The Antwerp Polyglot.

          III. The Paris Polyglot.

          IV. The London Polyglot (Walton's Polyglot).

          V. Minor Polyglots.

          Polyglot Bibles are editions of the Bible presenting the text in
          several languages side by side. The practical needs of the Jews
          after Hebrew ceased to be a living tongue led to the preparation
          of manuscripts giving, with the original Hebrew, translations or
          paraphrases in Aramaic, Greek, Arabic, Persian, and the
          languages of Europe. Like conditions in the Church were met in
          similar manner. Certain manuscripts of the New Testament in both
          Greek and Latin are mentioned in the article [364]Bible-Text,
          II, 1, § 9. An edition in the original and in modern Greek was
          printed in 1638 at the instance of Cyril Lucar (see [365]Bible
          Versions, B, VIII), and the needs of Syria, Egypt, and Armenia
          are met in like manner by editions still issued by Rome and by
          Protestant Bible Societies. The so-called glossaries (see
          [366]Glosses, Biblical) and interlinear versions giving the
          Vulgate and the vernacular text of the Middle Ages may also be
          mentioned in this connection. And there are numerous modern
          copies of the Vulgate accompanied by an English, German, French,
          Spanish, or Italian translation.

          The name Polyglot, however, can not strictly be given to
          editions presenting but two languages (Gk. polys = "many"), and,
          in common usage, is restricted to certain particular works,
          viz.:

          I. The Complutensian Polyglot, one of the most noted and rarest
          of Biblical works, was undertaken under the supervision and at
          the expense of Cardinal Francisco Ximenez de Cisneros,
          archbishop of Toledo and chancellor of Castile (d. 1517), and
          was prepared by the most famous scholars of Spain, such as
          Demetrius Ducas of Crete, Antonio of Lebrija, Diego Lopez de
          Stunica, Ferdinand Nuñez de Guzman, and Alphonso of Zamora.
          After years of labor the work was printed at Alcala (Latin,
          Complutum) between 1513 and 1517, being finished only a few
          months before the death of the cardinal, and was published in
          1520 with the sanction of Pope Leo X. It consists of six folio
          volumes, the first four including the Old Testament, the fifth
          the New Testament, and the sixth being a Hebrew-Chaldee lexicon
          with grammatical and other notes (printed separately as Alphonsi
          Zamorensis introductiones artis grammaticæ Hebraicæ, Alcala,
          1526). The languages are (1) the Hebrew of the Old Testament;
          (2) the Targum of Onkelos; (3) the Septuagint (here printed for
          the first time and with remarkable alterations of the
          manuscripts to make the text fit the Hebrew or the Latin); (4)
          the Vulgate; (5) the Greek New Testament. Latin translations of
          the Targum and Septuagint are appended. The title-page and last
          page are given in reduced facsimile in Schaff's Companion to the
          Greek Testament (New York, 1885).

          II. The Antwerp Polyglot (Biblia Regia) was printed at the
          expense of Philip II of Spain by the famous Antwerp printer
          Christophe Plantin (8 vols., folio, 1569-72). Benedictus Arias
          Montanus (see [367]Arias, Benedictus) had charge of the work,
          with the help of Spanish, Belgian, and French scholars, among
          them André Maes, Guy le Fèvre de la Boderie, and François
          Rapheleng. Volumes i-iv contain the Old Testament, vol. v the
          New; besides the original texts, the Vulgate, and the Septuagint
          with Latin translation, Aramaic targums of the Old Testament
          (with the exception of Daniel, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Chronicles)
          are given, with Latin translation; also the old Syriac (Peshito)
          version of the New Testament, lacking II Peter, II and III John,
          Jude, and the Apocalypse; it is printed with both Syriac and
          Hebrew characters and has a Latin translation. Volumes vi-vii
          contain the Hebrew lexicon of Sanctes Pagninus, the
          Syriac-Chaldee lexicon of Le Fèvre de la Boderie, a Syriac
          grammar by Maes, a Greek dictionary and archeological treatises
          by Arias Montanus, and many brief philological and critical
          notes. The last volume repeats the Hebrew and Greek texts with
          interlinear Latin translations, by Sanctes Pagninus of the
          former, and the Vulgate for the latter; this part of the work,
          especially the New Testament, has often been reprinted. The
          critical preparation was defective and the manuscripts used were
          of secondary importance; in many places there is dependence on
          the Complutensian work.

          III. The Paris Polyglot, the most magnificent but scientifically
          least important of all, was printed at the expense of Guy Michel
          le Jay in seven languages (10 vols., 1629-45). Volumes i-iv are
          merely reprints of the Antwerp Bible. Volumes v-vi contain the
          New Testament from the same edition, augmented by the Syriac
          Antilegomena and an Arabic version with Latin translation. The
          other volumes contain (1) the so-called Samaritan Pentateuch
          with its Samaritan translation (see [368]Bible Versions, A, IV);
          (2) the Syriac; and (3) an Arabic version of the Old Testament,
          all with Latin translations. The Oratorian Jean Morin prepared
          the Samaritan texts and the Maronite Gabriel Sionita did most of
          the Syriac work.

          IV. The London Polyglot (Walton's Polyglot), the most scholarly
          and the commonest of all, was undertaken by [369]Brian Walton,
          afterward bishop of Chester, and completed in 1657 (6 vols.,
          London). Walton had the help of nearly all contemporary English
          scholars, particularly the Orientalists Edmund Castell, Edward
          Pococke, Thomas Hyde, Dudley Loftus, Abraham Weelocke, Thomas
          Greaves, and Samuel Clarke. The excellence of this Polyglot over
          others consists in the greater number of old Oriental versions
          and the much greater and more intelligent work of the editor.
          The first four volumes contain the Old Testament in the Hebrew
          with the Antwerp interlinear version, the Samaritan Pentateuch,
          the Septuagint from the Vatican edition of 1587 with the
          variants of the Alexandrine codex, the fragments of the Itala
          collected by Flaminius Nobilius, the Vulgate from the Vatican
          edition with the corrections of Lucas of Brügge, the Peshito
          augmented by the translation of certain apocrypha, a better
          edition of the Arabic version, the Targums from Buxtorf, the
          Samaritan translation of the Pentateuch, and the Ethiopic
          version of the Psalms and Song of Songs. These texts (nine in
          all), with Latin translations of the Greek and the Oriental, are
          arranged side by side or one under the other. Two additional
          Targums, that of Pseudo-Jonathan and that of Jerusalem, with a
          Persian translation are given in vol. iv. The New Testament
          appears in vol. v, the text with few changes from Robert
          Stephens's folio edition of 1550; then are given Arias's version
          and the variants of the Alexandrine codex, Syriac, Latin,
          Ethiopic, and Arabic versions, and the Gospels in Persian, with
          literal Latin translations. Walton's Apparatus, a
          critical-historical introduction in vol. i, was not superseded
          for more than a century, and was several times republished.
          Volume vi contains critical collections to all the texts
          published. Finally Edmund Castell's Lexicon Heptaglottum (2
          parts, Cambridge, 1669) is usually counted as an integral part
          of this Polyglot.

          V. Minor Polyglots: Less important are (1) the Heidelberg
          Polyglot (Polyglotta Sanctandreana; Old Testament, 1586; New
          Testament added, 1599), probably edited by Bonaventure Corneille
          Bertram, professor of Hebrew at Geneva 1566-84, afterward
          preacher at Frankenthal. It contains the original texts and
          Septuagint, with Latin translations, and the Vulgate, all from
          the Antwerp Polyglot. (2) The Hamburg Polyglot (1596) consists
          of six volumes by David Wolder, giving in four columns the Greek
          texts, the Vulgate, Pagninus's Latin translation of the Old
          Testament and Beza's of the New, with Luther's German version,
          to which Elias Hutter's Hebrew Bible of 1587 was added with new
          titlepage bearing the date 1596. (3) The Nuremberg Polyglot, the
          work of [370]Elias Hutter, comprises (a) an Old Testament in six
          languages (1599), carried only to the Book of Ruth; (b) a
          Hebrew, Greek, Latin, and German Psalter (1602); (c) a New
          Testament in twelve languages (2 parts, 1599)--Syriac, Italian,
          Hebrew, Spanish, Greek, French, Vulgate, English, German,
          Danish, Bohemian, and Polish; (d) a New Testament in Hebrew,
          Greek, Latin, and German, taken from the preceding (1602). (4)
          The Leipsic Polyglot of Christianus Reineccius, rector at
          Weiesenfels, has the New Testament in five languages (1713) and
          the Old Testament in four (2 vols., 1750-51). (5) The Bielefeld
          Polyglot, ed. R. Stier and C. G. W. Theile (4 vols., ii and iii
          in two parts, 1846-55), contains the Old Testament in Hebrew,
          Greek, Latin, and German, the New Testament in the last three
          languages, with variants of different German versions in the
          fourth column; there are also copies with the English version in
          place of the German. Lastly, mention may be made of the Biblia
          Hexaglotta of E. R. de Levante (6 vols., London, 1874-1876), and
          Bagster's Biblia sacra polyglotta, with prolegomena by S. Lee
          (London, 1831). Other works including only portions of the Bible
          do not fall within the scope of this article.

   Bibles, Rabbinic
          BIBLES, RABBINIC, called also Great Bibles (Mik?ra'ot Gedolot):
          Hebrew Bibles containing, besides the original text, the
          commentaries of sundry Jewish rabbis. The first of these Bibles
          was published by Daniel Bomberg, edited by Felix Pratensis (4
          parts, Venice, 1517-18); it contains, besides the Hebrew, the
          Aramaic paraphrases and commentaries of eight different writers
          on certain books, Masoretic notes, and other matter. As the
          editor was a convert to Christianity, his work did not prove
          acceptable to the Jews. Its faults induced Bomberg to undertake
          another edition, for which he employed as editor the celebrated
          Masoretic scholar Jacob ben Hayyim, who in after-life also
          embraced Christianity. This edition, the Hebrew title of which
          means "The Holy Gate of the Lord," was published at Venice (4
          vols., 154-25) and, like the first edition, contains the Hebrew
          text, the Aramaic commentaries, and the Masoretic notes. The
          editor's introduction, containing a treatise on the Masorah, has
          been translated into English by Christian David Ginsburg (Jacob
          ben Chajim's Introduction to the Rabbinic Bible, London, 1865),
          who based The Massoretic Critical Text of the Hebrew Bible
          (1894) on this edition of Hayyim.

          A revised and improved edition of the second Bomberg Bible was
          published (Venice, 1546-48) under the supervision of Cornelius
          Adelkind. The changes made in this edition were the omission of
          some commentaries and the substitution of others. Bomberg's
          fourth Rabbinic Bible, by J. de Gara, was carried through the
          press and corrected by Isaac ben Joseph Salem and Isaac ben
          Gershon Treves (4 vols., Venice, 1568). The correctors remark at
          the end of the work that they have reinserted in this edition
          the portion of the Masorah omitted in the edition of 1546-48.
          Appended to this is the so-called Jerusalem Targum on the
          Pentateuch.

          A Rabbinic Bible (4 vols., Venice, 1617-18) was published by
          Pietro and Lorenzo Bragadini and edited by the celebrated Leon
          of Modena. It contains the Aramaic paraphrases, the Masorah, and
          the Rabbinic commentaries of De Gara's edition. This edition,
          however, is of less value to the critical student, being
          censored by the Inquisition.

          Buxtorf's Rabbinic Bible or Biblia sacra Hebraica et Chaldaica
          cum Masora, quæ critica Hebræorum sacra est, magna et parva ac
          selectissimis Hebræorum interpretum commentariis (4 parts, 2
          vols., Basel, 1618-19) has a Latin preface by Buxtorf, a table
          of the number of chapters in the Bible, and a poem of Aben Ezra
          in the Hebrew language. Besides the Hebrew and the Aramaic
          paraphrases, it contains the commentaries of Rashi, Aben Ezra,
          and others, and Buxtorf's Tiberias sive commentarius
          masorethicus triplex. The whole is formed after Jacob ben
          Hayyim's second edition (1546-48), with some corrections and
          alterations by Buxtorf. Buxtorf's Bible is imperfect, but in
          spite of its deficiencies, the student must still thank the
          editor for his work, which, however, was criticized by R. Simon
          in his Histoire critique du Vieux Testament (p. 513).

          The next Rabbinic Bible was the Sepher Kehillat Moshe, or "Book
          of the Congregation of Moses," edited by Moses Frankfurter (4
          vols., Amsterdam, 1724-27). This is the most valuable of all the
          Rabbinic Bibles. It is founded upon the Bomberg editions, and
          gives not only their contents, but also those of Buxtorf's, with
          much additional matter.

          The latest Rabbinic Bible is the Mik?ra'ot Gedolot published at
          Warsaw (12 vols., 1860-68) by Lebenson. This gigantic work
          contains thirty-two commentaries, old and new, among others the
          critical commentary of Norzi. The Hebrew text is on the whole
          very correct, the size is more convenient than that of its
          predecessors, and the edition is recommended by the best Jewish
          authorities in Poland and Austria.

   Bibliander (Buchmann), Theodor
          BIBLIANDER (BUCHMANN), THEODOR: Swiss theologian and teacher; b.
          at Bischofszell (11 miles s.s.e. of Constance), Switzerland,
          1504 (1509?); d. at Zurich Nov. 26, 1564. He studied Hebrew
          under Jacob Ceporinus in Zurich, in 1526 under Pellican and
          OEcolampadius at Basel, and later on under Capito. When Duke
          Frederick II of Liegnitz in 1527 asked for teachers for his high
          school, the Council of Zurich sent him Bibliander, who served
          there two years with distinction. He then returned home and was
          appointed Zwingli's successor in the theological professorship
          at Zurich in 1531.

          Bibliander's specialty was linguistics, and he used to call
          himself homo grammaticus; he was versed in the Semitic dialects
          and was master of several modern languages. From the beginning
          his rendering of the Prophets was successful, was indorsed by
          Bullinger and Pellican, and caused J. H. Hottinger to call him
          the father of exegetical theology in Switzerland. He wrote also
          on Hebrew Grammar and on Comparative Linguistics. Perhaps the
          greatest sensation he caused was that produced by his
          publication of the Koran (1543, rev. ed., 1550); the magistrates
          at Basel tried to prohibit the book, but Luther interfered in
          defense of it and of the translator. Bibliander issued studies
          on the Gospel of Mark and the Protevangelium Jacobi, translating
          them into Latin. His works betray a rich historical knowledge.
          Especially worthy of mention in this regard are his De Ratione
          Temporum (1551) and Temporum Supputatio (1558). Most of his
          writings were never published, but are preserved in manuscript
          at Zurich.

          Next to Bullinger, Bibliander appears as the most respected
          representative of the Church at Zurich. He participated in all
          theological and ecclesiastical discussions, preserving the
          heritage of Zwingli. He assisted in the publication of Zwingli's
          and OEcolampadius's letters (1536). In some treatises he openly
          attacked the Catholic Church and the Tridentinum (De Legitima
          Vindicatione Christianismi, 1553), and antagonized the Roman
          propaganda, appealing to England as the land of Christian
          liberty. He advocated missions to the Jews and Mohammedans, and
          went so far as to start on mission work, being restrained only
          by Bullinger's representations. He was made emeritus and given a
          pension in 1560.

  I. Conception and Problem.

          Criticism, like interpretation, is an art; the two are related
          to each other as sisters, and both are nourished by science.
          Interpretation is the art of bringing to the comprehension what
          has really been handed down and of grasping it as it really is;
          criticism is the art of rightly estimating what has been
          actually apprehended according to its real value. Interpretation
          without criticism befogs and enervates; criticism without
          interpretation is vague and mere intellectual play. Since man
          can not understand without exercising the faculty of judgment,
          in work that deals with spiritual verities the two are not
          separated, yet the point of view from which they approach the
          same object is as different as their method. Interpretation
          proceeds inductively, collecting everything which bears upon the
          understanding of the matter; criticism proceeds deductively,
          furnishing the canons by which to value that understanding.
          While one asks about the fact, the other asks about the truth of
          it; one builds, the other classifies and estimates the material
          and tests the building process. Criticism is the inverse of
          interpretation, and more. While it pronounces upon the results
          of interpretation, it opens new questions about the
          trustworthiness or untrustworthiness, the completeness or
          fragmentariness, the genealogy and the significance of the
          object; and thus it affords a starting-point for final valuation
          and definition. It is skill, partly natural, partly acquired, in
          distinguishing and appropriating true from false, good from bad,
          beautiful from ugly, whether derived from contemplative
          perception and revelation or through chance or tradition. Its
          purpose is positive, though its result may often be negative. It
          knows no other authority than that of the case before it, no
          other method than that demanded by the same.

    1. The History of the Term.

          The word has been in use since Plato's time; he distinguished
          between criticism and construction, the two being employed in
          the science of knowledge. Aristotle introduced a distinction
          between the critical and the literary arts, which was taken up
          by the Alexandrian school in connection with literature and
          particularly with poetry. Clement of Alexandria established in
          his review of Greek culture the fact that grammatikos as a
          technical term is later than kritikos. Terminology, however, was
          unstable in the ancient world. Philologos was differentiated
          from philosophos, meaning not the independent inquirer but the
          critic and expounder of classical productions. As the art of
          valuing, criticism is the product of the eighteenth century. The
          Encyclopedists called it in particular the restorer of ancient
          literature, in general the art of open-eyed examination of human
          productions and of judging them justly.

    2. Limitations and Sphere of the Critic.

          The critic stands in an opposition between subjective and
          objective. The obscure, the ugly, the disorderly, the arrogant,
          the artificial--everything which tends to distort a pure
          impression--arouse the critical function, which manifests itself
          in simple aversion or blame, or in a deliberate exposition of
          the causes of distortion. Limitations to understanding lie also
          in the person. Complex and difficult to grasp are the conditions
          and impulses which deceive, divert, and suborn the faculty of
          judgment. Personal taste, inexperience, dogmatic presupposition,
          arrogance--such hindrances are as numerous as the emotions of
          the soul. A valuable inheritance sometimes suffers injury by the
          encroachments of critical ineptitude. Whoever regards a thing as
          worthy has a sense of loss, even if the criticism be pertinent;
          much more is that the case if in the critical process
          insincerity and arbitrariness be present. It is not surprising,
          therefore, that esthetic and religious natures are filled with
          aversion to criticism and distrust of it. Goethe once said that
          a book which had accomplished great results was simply above the
          operations of criticism, and that criticism is generally a mere
          habit of moderns. Such an attitude seems to the critic mere
          obedience to blind authority. Great events and much of
          literature have rested on fictitious bases. Apocrypha and
          pseudepigrapha claim genuineness. Such facts are warrant enough
          for the activities of critical science.

    3. Biblical Criticism.

          The general standards of criticism, like those of
          interpretation, rest on logic, philosophy, and rhetoric. It
          applies those standards to the particular case, and the general
          rules are modified to accord with the demands of the occasion.
          Since the Scriptures of the Old and the New Testaments have a
          special importance as a related whole, Biblical criticism is a
          special and independent branch. It deals with sources, history,
          and religion; it tests the historical worth of the documents
          which set forth the religion of the two Testaments. It has as
          its object the discovery of the religious life operative therein
          by reason of which this literature has its special meaning.
          There is a double outlook here; insight into the essence of
          religion and into the essence of historic fact.

          Biblical criticism is on its other side historical criticism.
          Hence its function is to separate the natural progress of events
          and the religious limitations of the Biblical exposition of
          history in order to comprehend their relations upon the basis of
          this separation. Religious occurrences it must seek to explain
          upon psychological, pathological, and historico-religious
          grounds. Lessing says that "the dramatic poet is not a
          historian; historical verity is not his purpose, only the means
          to it." Is this poet then a falsifier of history? Similarly for
          the Biblical writers historical truth is only a means for
          offering religious truth; it is the channel of the revelation
          from God. Consequently the task is to examine case by case in
          order to determine how far historical reality carries
          revelation. Its own standpoint, therefore, is assured to this
          science. It asks with what right and under what conditions and
          limitations the Scriptures exist as a religious collection. It
          gives historical rating to the contents. Its leading word
          is--discriminate, which it uses in promoting recognition of
          worth or its opposite, of fact or mere appearance.

  II. The Critical Method.

    1. Fundamental Assumptions.

          To achieve real service in Biblical criticism appreciation of
          the religious factor is necessary. The critic, however, may not
          walk in a rut if he is to attain a right position. After he has
          through interpretation grasped the object of investigation, he
          gives it rating according to the conditions and warrant of the
          facts of the case. He proceeds upon the immanent, not the
          transcendent. And after the right criterion is found, he has to
          remember that a complete and not a partial or fragmentary
          investigation is required, and further that fast hold must be
          laid upon equipoise between critical acuteness and the
          perception of what is possible and plain. Eccles. vii, 20 has
          its application here, "God made man upright, but he has sought
          out many inventions." What is the inherent standard of Biblical
          criticism? The historical narratives of the Bible are, so far as
          they deal with religious life, interpretations of history and
          testimonies to faith. To express a right judgment the critic
          must determine the relation between the historical and the
          religious and decide which is the more prominent. De Wette
          regarded the Pentateuch as poetry; the opposite view makes the
          Bible historical only. Between these extremes lies the
          recognition that the Bible employs history for religious
          purposes. Is this religious significance to be regarded as
          expert emphasis upon the worth and force of a real occurrence or
          was it used to support some dogmatic purpose? Is it found in or
          read into the case? Is it in the main possible to recognize the
          fact in the religious dress?

          These possibilities the critic must take into account as he
          holds the scales of truth, testing the composite parts of the
          Bible and proceeding thence to a consideration of the Bible as a
          whole. Upon this ground only can the decision be rendered how
          far the historic facts which the Bible reports stand in organic
          connection with their religious valuation and whether they may
          be regarded as history or as legend, fable, or myth. The varying
          ratio of the admixture of the historical and the religious and
          the degree of its significance must be observed; and especially
          the interval between the Old Testament and the New in their
          historical relations, original limitations, and purposes must be
          kept in mind. It is one thing to appreciate the essential
          qualities of Hebrew national literature, covering a thousand
          years in its development, and another to apprehend the worth and
          character of the New Testament, which is the literature of a
          religious propaganda covering but two generations. Yet the
          critic's methods are essentially the same, corresponding to the
          varied historical limitations of the subject-matter. When the
          question of the essence of Christianity arises, the bearing of
          the Old Testament religion upon Christianity is to be decided
          and grasped.

    2. Classification.

          The fundamental axiom shows that each literary production, as
          well as each body of writings which has a common bond, requires
          its appropriate method both of interpretation and of criticism.
          Means and end will agree when the character of the whole
          presents itself in the parts; the last-named will separate and
          individualize themselves where origins and relations differ. The
          classifications of Biblical criticism arise not out of logical
          abstractions but out of the demands made by the individualistic
          Biblical qualities. Criticism of the canon asks how and with
          what right the two Testaments were united in one book, how and
          by what methods the correct text of that which has come down is
          to be ascertained, what was the origin and what is the
          historical worth and what the relation of the present form of
          the books to the original form. It draws conclusions from the
          data furnished by interpretation. On the basis of the
          recognition (1) of the suitability of means to ends and (2) of
          the literary individuality, it pronounces upon the worth of a
          document as a source and upon its relation to the whole to which
          it belongs and which it serves. The science divides, therefore,
          into criticism of the text, of the language, of the history, of
          the style, and constructive criticism.

    3. Function.

          Since subjectively criticism finds its occasion in the limits of
          the understanding, its starting-point is doubt about the
          trustworthiness and the arrangement of what has come down. This
          doubt proceeds to ask the reason for this impression. If the
          reason lies not in the spiritual being of the doubter but in the
          object, then some defect is understood to exist in expression,
          contents, or style. The critic has then to discover the kind of
          defect and to discern its cause. As a means to this, Jerome
          directs the critic to digest, arrange, deduce, construct. In
          other words, the critic first diagnoses the case and then
          applies the remedy. And in this process comparison is constantly
          employed, holding in view the separate parts and the united
          whole. The division of the field of the critic into external and
          internal, higher and lower, does not have any essential truth at
          its root, and should be rejected for that given at the end of
          the last paragraph.

  III. The Departments of Criticism.

    1. Criticism of the Canon.

          That the Old Testament existed as a holy authority for the
          synagogue and that the New in connection with the Old had the
          same value for the Church is the fact the success and the right
          of which criticism has to investigate. It notes the process of
          formation of the canon and the internal testimony of the
          canonical writings as related to the authority attributed to
          them. It asks whether the canon was made or whether it grew,
          whether and how far its parts are pseudepigraphic. For the Old
          Testament there is outside testimony only from late Judaism and
          the Talmud; for the New there is a wealth of evidence arising
          from the circumstances under which it came into existence by
          about 180 A.D. One result of criticisms is to reveal the motive
          of canon-formation and also the correctness of the separation of
          the literature made authoritative by comparison of it with the
          noncanonical (see [374]Cannon of Scripture).

    2. Textual Criticism and Apparatus.

          A preliminary in this work is the collection of the
          text-critical apparatus which shall present an orderly and
          complete picture of the condition of the text. The documents
          must be described and their characteristics brought to light.
          The sources of text-criticism are manuscripts in the original
          languages, lectionaries of selected parts, translations,
          citations; for the Old Testament the Masorah, for the Septuagint
          and the New Testament also patristic commentaries and scholia.
          The variant readings in this mass of materials are to be
          arranged and classified, a preliminary to which is the valuation
          of the text-sources on the basis of age, genealogy, and
          trustworthiness. In the Old Testament the difference of the
          Masoretic text from that of the Septuagint proves the two to be
          independent witnesses; but the fact that the text of the latter
          is not yet settled makes difficult the task of arbitrating
          between the two. On the other hand, the New Testament writings
          were not, before the time of Origen, handled with the care
          bestowed by the Jews on the text of the law. The collection of
          apparatus for the New Testament text presents not only an
          agitated sea of differences in orthography and word-forms which
          create little or no difference in sense, but also a series of
          variations which affect the meaning and educed the wail of
          Origen that they were the result not only of carelessness on the
          part of the scribes but also of wilfulness and design. The task
          is to bring order into this mass of variations. There have been
          discerned three principal types of text, the Alexandrian, the
          Western, and the Constantinopolitan. The text of the Synoptic
          Gospels shows the most serious variations, in which purpose is
          manifest to make parallel passages read in the same way and to
          supply omissions. The text of Revelation and of the Lucan
          writings also is in a bad condition. Great differences exist
          between the text of the Alexandrian and the Greco-Latin types.
          The last word on relative values has not yet been said, and the
          matter is still further complicated by the fact that the
          minuscules have not yet been taken fully into consideration, and
          they contain very many excellent and independent readings. See
          [375]Bible Text.

          The purpose of comparison of variant texts is approximation to
          the original. The critic estimates the age of a document. For
          this much help has been received from the papyri and parchments
          recovered in Egypt, from which it has been learned that the
          earliest texts were written in capitals and without accents or
          marks of punctuation, and that the word or syllable was broken
          at the end of the line as the demands of space required. Study
          of the processes of reproduction of manuscripts has shown that
          errors are either mechanical or designed. The former are
          illustrated by the doubling of a word or a passage or the
          omission of the same either by an error of the eye or of the
          ear, or by the substitution of one word or letter for another
          which resembles it either in form or sound. Of conscious or
          designed variations from the original, some were brought about
          by attempts to smooth a rough passage or to illumine an obscure
          one, to correct real or supposed errors, to make two parallel
          passages read in the same way, or to change the reading so as to
          support some dogmatic interest. The Old Testament was originally
          written without punctuation or helps to reading and
          pronunciation; the possibility of error is, therefore, greatly
          increased as compared with the Greek text, the vowels of which
          were always written.

    3. Linguistic Criticism.

          After interpretation has set forth the lexicographic and
          grammatical character of the language, criticism inquires into
          the relation of expression to thought, unity in the methods of
          expression, and individual characteristics in writing as related
          to the general character of the language, and into the various
          influences which have controlled the form. Dissimilarity in
          style in parts argues dissimilarity in authorship;
          disarrangement or disorder suggests interpolation. Especially
          valuable are the tests which depend upon uniformity in the use
          of certain fundamental notions such as those of the kingdom of
          God, life, faith, righteousness, spirit, flesh. Similarly use is
          made of collection and comparison of idioms which characterize a
          writing or a group of writings, and in this case critical
          judgment is of great importance. Individuality is thus
          discovered, since the idiosyncrasies of writers are in the main
          unconscious and undesigned. And rhetorical qualities also come
          into play, the tendency to a type of expression or fondness for
          certain words or kinds of figures or turns of sentence.
          Recognition of characteristic ways of using language adds to
          text-critical apparatus, since it not only presents the facts of
          different readings and of peculiarities, but also notes their
          effects, influences, and modifications. So that text-criticism
          and criticism of the language work together in correcting an
          unintelligible or corrupt text by employing conjecture. By this
          is not meant merely subjective sagacity or ineptly used
          technical skill. Conjecture is the result of study of the causes
          of error in the text which marks them as mechanical or designed,
          and then seeks a reading in accordance with the habit and
          character of the document under examination, a reading which on
          known principles of error in transmission will produce the
          particular error.

    4. Historical Criticism.

          Historical criticism is applied not merely to works on history
          but to any literary product of the past which claims or really
          has importance for any historical reason. The result of this
          process is pronouncement upon the worth of any particular
          document as a source. It deals with the genuineness, unity,
          integrity, and trustworthiness of a writing, asks whether it is
          as the author wrote it or whether it has been corrupted or
          falsified, whether it reflects the habit of the author assumed
          or of the times in which it is placed. Since it is seldom that
          explicit external testimony to a document is available,
          criticism usually proceeds upon internal evidence. But this is
          not always decisive. Conceivably, the tradition of Israel's
          sojourn in Egypt might have arisen out of the story of the
          Babylonian exile. So of the New Testament writings, the decision
          whether they are really documents of the apostolic age depends
          finally upon the judgment of their character as a whole and upon
          appraisement of the distance between them and the postapostolic
          and apocryphal literature.

          The three points upon which the critic is intent are not of
          equal weight. Thus, though the authenticity of a writing be
          denied on internal grounds, the worth of the writing as a source
          is not thereby necessarily denied, for the document may have
          been produced anonymously, may be a genuine witness for the
          times in which it was written, and yet have had a name wrongly
          attached to it later. Examples of this are the Books of Samuel,
          the Gospel of Matthew, and the Epistle to the Hebrews, which
          last is a genuine document of the apostolic age, though the
          authorship is undetermined. So integrity does not of itself
          determine source-value. Investigation in this direction
          discovers gaps or additions and relates them to historic
          credibility. The final test has reference to this duality.
          Investigation into a writing as a whole leads to the discussion
          of its composition. Criticism of sources enters here, which on
          the basis of the linguistic character of the finished work and
          of its parts decides whether the work is a unit or is composite.
          In the latter case the questions arise what was the original
          form and how far it has been changed by the successive hands
          through which it has passed; whether the parts are in their
          original form or have been worked over, and in the latter case
          whether in some dogmatic interest. Such are the problems which
          arise respecting the Pentateuch and the Gospels. Decision in
          favor of the trustworthiness of a document in itself a unit and
          complete is carried a step further toward assurance by
          comparison with the general whole to which it belongs. This
          involves consideration of linguistic characteristics, of the
          circle of ideas in which it moves, the general trend of thought.
          Account is taken of external testimony. In this case error has
          to be guarded against, since the trustworthiness and competence
          of the witness is itself a subject for investigation. The
          criticism of the Epistle to the Philippians gives an
          illustration of the difficulties of the process, where
          irreconcilably different conclusions have been reached by Baur,
          Holster, and P. W. Schmidt.

          The most important problem affecting credibility arises from the
          specific character of the Biblical narratives. What attitude
          shall be assumed toward miracles? How far are the reports
          legendary or mythical? What is the relation of the religious
          idea to the question of the historicity of the reports and of
          their worth as sources? The position taken will depend upon the
          philosophical position of the critic. The theist does not
          disavow belief in miracles and values the divine
          self-consciousness of Jesus as testimony to his living
          participation in deity. But the historic spirit of the times
          enters a caveat by noting the limitation placed on the reporters
          by the characteristics of the times in which they lived.
          Moreover, he who accepts Jesus as a wonder-worker is not called
          on as a critic to prove the reports of miracles reliable; nor is
          he who accepts Jesus as God's son required to prove the stories
          of the infancy, analogies of which are so abundantly available.
          But with the recognition that there are obscurities in the
          reports of miracles and that poetry, legend, and myth are used
          by the Bible, the last word has not been spoken on the
          historicity of Biblical narratives. When the English minister
          Mitchell said in relation to the wars of Frederick the Great
          that the latter was fighting for the freedom of the human race,
          he gave an interpretation of history but did not alter the
          historic fact. It is then possible that without altering the
          facts the Gospels, under the impression made by the person of
          Jesus, acknowledge him as Son of God and Savior of the world. If
          the theologian speaks of salvation as a fact which has become
          known in history, that is not a dogmatic dislocation but a
          correct valuation of the historical order in which the Christian
          religion and its Old Testament precursor reveal themselves.

    5. Criticism of Style.

          "Style is only the order and progress in which thought takes
          form; it supposes the union and exercise of all the intellectual
          faculties, and it is the man" (Buffon). This utters the final
          decision in the reaching of which the critical and hermeneutical
          faculties unite more closely than in the processes named above.
          It asks the question, what purposes did the writing have and how
          did it attain them? It takes into account the total impression
          made by the document, the progress of thought and the conception
          of history it embodies; it notes clearness and force or
          indefiniteness and unwieldiness, originality or accord with
          accustomed forms. And in the background is ever a reference to
          the historical setting and relationships. Historical criticism
          may shove compositeness in a document and answer the question
          whether the elements are united by a loose idea or are worked
          into each other. In the latter case criticism of style shows the
          relation of the parts to the whole. When historical criticism
          has thoroughly investigated historical conditions and order, the
          question of credibility in a new sense arises. Was the purpose
          objective or personal, did the ideal enter into the personal,
          did personal interests and passion modify the objectivity of the
          writing? For documents run to Tendenz whenever they are not
          purely objective narrative.

    6. Reconstructive Criticism.

          The results from the processes so far reviewed are now positive,
          now negative. They produce decisions upon the completeness,
          reliability, and value of what has been transmitted. That done,
          the relation of the product under discussion to the original
          actuality in particular and in general remains to be
          investigated. What is historic reconstruction? Niebuhr's History
          of Rome was the first concrete example of the results of the
          process. It embodied his endeavor to pierce through the
          displacements and exaggerations of national pride which
          influenced the historical form of the statements and to discover
          actuality as it was and developed. His method is and remains the
          method of constructive criticism. The first step, then, is
          criticism of sources, which not only reveals their nature and
          value, but grasps also their connection with the original fact,
          their original relations, their mutual dependence or
          independence. In religious literature it is necessary to have
          regard to the conceptions embodied to see whether these are the
          original gift of the religion or whether they have entered
          during the course of the development. Hence the sources have to
          be traced to their original form, conceptions are abstracted,
          the historical course of events displayed, and the method by
          which events have worked out of the objective and essential
          conditions discovered.

          The dominant method of source-criticism is literary. It deals
          with documentary indication, traces backward parallel traditions
          and distinguishes their relationship, genealogy, and dependence;
          it shows their original or secondary character, seeks the
          occasions of their deviations; in documents it would discern the
          seams of joining, the manner and form of the insertions. And
          then often the question arises whether an oral or a written
          source lies in the background. And besides this there is in
          Biblical literature the complicating factor of the editors; so
          that modern criticism is well represented graphically by the
          "Rainbow Bible" In the foreground of interest now is the proving
          of the relationship of Biblical presentations and conceptions to
          the original form and sense and the attempt to show their
          interrelationship. Are the leading Biblical conceptions original
          and in their original form? Do the terms used carry their
          original meanings, or has the original sense become detached and
          connected itself with some other term? The answers to such
          questions will lead back to the early forms of the religion of
          the Old Testament and of Christianity, will produce a history of
          religious ideas; but the work is yet in its infancy. Even the
          prehistoric cult-motive, found in totemism, animism, and belief
          in demons will not clone the inquiry; there is the background of
          the self-seeking impulses which led men to placate ghosts and
          employ magic and sorcery. And the relations of these to the Old
          Testament and the New are yet under discussion. They indeed
          point out in which direction criticism must direct its
          researches.

          The highest and most difficult task is the reconstruction of the
          historic process, the monuments of which are found in the
          criticized writings. It purposes a presentation of the entire
          circle of ideas, and seeks to discover from the deficient
          sources the original connection, and from the reports brought
          together the original development. The results then are
          historical, the basis sought is the most ultimate facts
          attainable, but the degree of assurance necessarily varies. In
          Biblical science the two objective points are the recovery of
          the history of Israel and of the history of the origins of the
          Christian Church. The crux of the first is the relationship of
          the prophetic literature to the Pentateuch. Is the latter
          preprophetic or postprophetic and postexilic? Another question
          still under discussion is the historical value of the body of
          tradition about the patriarchs and Moses; estimates of the
          highest importance and bearing upon character hang upon the
          decision. The reconstruction of New Testament history depends
          upon the decision as to the existence or non-existence of usable
          sources of history in the New Testament. The new Dutch school
          returns a negative answer on the ground that New Testament
          literature is mostly pseudepigraphic. Everything here depends
          upon criticism of sources, upon the decision about the bases of
          the Synoptic Gospels, the Johannine literature, the Christology
          of the Epistles. Upon decisions rendered here hangs also the
          estimate of the person and work of the founder of Christianity.
          For the conception of apostolic times critical valuation of the
          worth of Acts as a source is required, and a determination of
          its relation to the Pauline Epistles and of the genuineness of
          the latter. In this case also conclusions the most opposite are
          reached with necessarily opposite results in the construction of
          history. The difficulties of the reconstruction of Biblical
          history are thus suggested, and in the work only a beginning has
          been made. Real progress is possible only if the critic is not
          self-deceived in respect to the continuity and completeness of
          the sources and the objective basis of his hypotheses, and if he
          does not forget that the history which he undertakes to
          reconstruct neither claims to nor can supply the religious force
          which is operative in history.

  IV. History of Criticism:

    1. Meaning and Limitations.

          This might be made to embrace all work conducted with critical
          insight as well as of all branches of Biblical science with the
          hypotheses and conclusions. Decision must be made between a
          review of the results and of the conditions and valuations which
          have given the impulse to a new series of questions. With the
          latter goes a description of the methods necessitated by the
          newer conditions. It is also to be remarked that criticism and
          interpretation, so to speak, alternate and relieve each other.
          Interpretation flourishes when tradition is accepted at its face
          value; criticism, when doubt has called in question that value,
          though indeed criticism is never beyond call.

    2. Hellenistic and Patristic Criticism.

          The Greeks were the fathers of criticism. No other people of the
          ancient world employed critical methods; the memory, not
          judgment, held sway. Judaism was no exception, for the Masorah
          is text-criticism in a limited sense only. But among the Greeks
          criticism was the handmaid of interpretation. Homer was their
          canon, furnishing the model of the completest expression of
          human relationships. Consequently, text- criticism found there
          its task and elaborated its methods, while interpretation was
          also at work. The questions of integrity, authenticity, and
          credibility were raised, but of course the answers were such as
          the age was qualified to give.

          It has often been denied that in the patristic age criticism
          existed. But patristic literature set itself the task of
          suppressing the old canon and replacing it by the new canon of
          the Old Testament and the New. And in this task criticism was a
          necessary agent. Alexandria and Antioch were the two seats of
          the new learning, the headquarters where the methods of the
          Greeks were applied in pursuit of the new object (see
          [376]Alexandria, School of; [377]Antioch, School of). Even the
          fourfold division of the science employed by the Greeks was
          adopted, though the whole work proceeded from a different
          standpoint. For the Greeks the esthetic was the principal thing,
          for the Church Fathers the religious; in both cases criticism
          served interpretation. The great undertaking of Origen to bring
          order into the corrupt text of the Septuagint remained
          incomplete and only introduced further confusion. What opinion
          is to be entertained of the recessions of Lucian and Hesychius
          is not yet certain. Jerome's efforts to obtain a better text of
          the Vulgate advanced text-criticism but little. In the matter of
          the canon of the New Testament, the genealogy of texts, the
          public use of the Scriptures, and their genuineness were
          discussed. Explanations were offered of the differences found in
          the writings ascribed to John. And in the councils and synods
          the matter of canonicity was raised for churchly authority to
          decide.

    3. Criticism from the Time of the Reformation.

          With the Reformation criticism took a new start upon a basis
          prepared by humanism, but within the bounds set by patristic
          criticism. The inspiration of the Bible was assumed, for the
          need felt was for nourishment of the spirit. Criticism assumed
          more definite forms after attempts were made to fix the teaching
          of the Evangelical Church. The early Protestant doctrine of
          inspiration attempted to exalt into law what had been till then
          simple religious statement. A wall was built upon the Protestant
          doctrine of Scripture against the Roman Catholic conceptions.
          Apologetics and harmonistics were created. The doctrine of
          verbal inspiration came into play until text-critical apparatus
          began to accumulate. Then dogmatic pronouncement upon the
          contents of Scripture, upon its clearness and sufficiency,
          stumbled over fact, and the earlier dogma of inspiration came to
          grief.

          Under such conditions Biblical criticism developed and became
          more opposed to dogmatism. Its apostle was Spinoza, who in his
          Tractatus theologicopoliticus authoritatively formulated the
          problem for the future. The skepticism of the seventeenth and
          the deism and rationalism of the eighteenth centuries changed
          not the form of the problem, but only the tone of the critic.
          Spinoza had given a comprehensive description of the exigency
          produced by a theology benumbed by dogmatics. His desire was to
          produce an undogmatic Christianity through criticism of the
          documents. Christianity was to be apprehended as teaching for
          practical life and not as philosophy. Religion was not to
          contradict reason. Criticism attacked the problem of the text
          and proceeded to discussion of the canon and its contents.
          Meanwhile the view was held that religion was something
          different from theology.

          The first attempts to build up a critical method were in the
          region of the Roman classics. J. Robertellus (De arte sive
          ratione corrigendi antiquorum libros disputatio, Padua, 1557)
          defined the sources of error in the text as additions,
          eliminations, transpositions, extensions, condensations,
          separations (of parts belonging together), joinings (of parts
          which should be kept apart), and variations. Caspar Scioppius
          (1597) argued against the "rash and audacious attempts to better
          the text." Johannes Clericus (1697) connected criticism of the
          classics and of the Bible. Perhaps he was the first to see that
          the canon had a history. L. Cappellus (1634), A. Pfeiffer
          (1680), and J. G. Carpzov (1728) argued for the unassailable
          authority of Scripture, but Carpzov's conjectural emendation of
          the Masoretic text aroused the acorn of the orthodox, who
          declared this text inviolable, as Ball and Erasmus had that of
          the Vulgate. But a new turn was given when the Oratorian J.
          Morinus (1633) exalted the text of the Septuagint over that of
          the Masoretes because derived from purer sources, though this
          valuation was discredited by the insecure readings of the
          Septuagint. Mill (1707) and Wetstein (1751) collected a rich
          apparatus for the New Testament, and Bengal proposed to alter
          the Textus receptus upon the basis of manuscript readings
          properly discriminated. The great Bentley's proposal to form a
          new recession of the Greek text (on the basis of MS. A and of
          the Vulgate) was wrecked on the rocks of the opposition of the
          theologians.

          The criticism of sources was established in Bentley's disproof
          of the genuineness of the Letters of Phalaris. That method was
          applied to Biblical literature only in individual instances
          among the Arminians and Socinians, as example of which is found
          in H. Grotius's work on Thessalonians. The application of this
          to the Old Testament was first made in Astruc's discussion of
          Genesis (1753). The antidogmatic position of criticism became
          ever more pronounced in the eighteenth century. English deism
          attacked clumsily the historicity of the Old Testament
          Scriptures. Skepticism rejoiced over the proof of variety in
          origin of Biblical writings. Rationalism sought to prove that
          history is no puzzle and all proceeds in rational order.
          Leasing's discussion with Goetze over the "Wolfenbüttel
          Fragments" fathomed deep waters. Against the reckless criticism
          of English deism appeared Lardner's Ancient Jewish and Heathen
          Testimonies to the Truth of the Christian Religion (1764-67),
          while through Michaelis and Semler criticism sought to find
          equipoise.

          The modern age of critical research began with the end of the
          eighteenth century. Its aim is an undogmatic method founded on
          fact, and its task is reconstruction of history on the basis of
          a grasp of original conditions and of the actual course of
          development. It makes use of psychology, linguistics, literary
          art, and history, and it attempts to guard against the one-sided
          application of any or all of these, recognizing that subjective
          criticism world produce results inconsonant with the spirit of
          the times in which the literature discussed was produced. The
          historical point of view as applied to the Bible was first
          expressed by Herder. Schleiermacher and Eichhorn made
          contributions to it, but not without error. Strauss's
          intellectual method overlooked criticism of sources. Bruno
          Bauer's reconstruction of the early history of Christianity on
          the basis of Philo, Seneca, and Greco-Roman philosophy was
          bettered by F. C. Baur, who sought a factual basis. Vatke's work
          on the Old Testament has been confirmed and extended by Reuss,
          Graf, Wellhausen, and Kuenen. How Biblical criticism has changed
          its center of gravity is illustrated by the dictionaries.
          Teller's Wörterbuch des Alten Testaments (6th ed., 1805) was
          ultrarationalistic. Winer's work (3d ed., 1847) expressed the
          materialistic doubt of De Wette. Schenkel's Bibellexicon
          (1869-75) represented the Tübingen school. Riehm-Baethgen (1897)
          shut the latter out as much as possible, in which line the new
          Dictionary of the Bible of Hastings follows, while the
          Encyclopædia Biblica occupies the most advanced position and
          complains that criticism of the New Testament is less advanced
          than that of the Old.

          (G. Heinrici.)

  V. Biblical Criticism in the Roman Catholic Church:

          It is a well-known fact that the subject of Biblical criticism
          has never received so much attention among Roman Catholic as
          among Protestant scholars. This disparity of interest in a topic
          so important is doubtless largely due to the fundamentally
          different attitude of the two Churches toward the Bible itself.
          While the early Reformers claimed to set aside tradition and
          church authority, and to make the Bible--and the Bible
          alone--the foundation-stone of their respective creeds, the
          Catholic theologians and controversialists, on the other hand,
          emphasized anew the principle of central organic authority. For
          Catholics the supreme and ultimate guide in matters of religion,
          faith, and morals is the infallible authority of the living
          Church--authority which in their view has been inherited from
          the Apostles and the Divine Founder of Christianity. This
          organized society is considered as the divinely appointed
          custodian of all revelation, whether contained in the Scriptures
          or in the storehouse of Christian tradition and to this society
          belongs, under divine guidance, the official and authoritative
          interpretation of Holy Writ. The great and exclusive importance
          given to the Bible in the Protestant communions naturally called
          for a deep and comprehensive study of the Scriptures; and this,
          in the nature of things, was bound to develop on critical lines;
          whereas Catholics, resting content with the principle of church
          authority, continued to look upon the Bible as something
          incidental and secondary in comparison with the living, teaching
          organization. Hence less interest on the part of the latter in
          the various branches of Biblical investigation, and likewise
          less alarm at the changes wrought by the so-called destructive
          criticism in the traditional views concerning the Bible.

          But, while the general interest in the topic has been less
          marked among Catholics, it is true that scholars belonging to
          that faith have made valuable contributions to the rise and
          growth of scientific Biblical criticism. The first, perhaps, who
          deserves mention is the French Oratorian Richard Simon
          (1638-1712) who, setting aside the abstract, a priori methods
          previously in vogue, began a study at once historical and
          critical of the principal topics pertaining to the origin and
          growth of the Bible. The results of his investigations, which
          were too far in advance of his age to receive intelligent
          appreciation from his contemporaries, were embodied in a series
          of volumes, which, however much they may have been superseded by
          writings of later scholars, are nevertheless extremely
          interesting as setting forth the true critical method and
          applying it with a freedom which was bound to provoke opposition
          and censure on the part of orthodox theologians such as Bossuet
          (see [378]Simon, Richard). It was the Catholic physician
          [379]Jean Astruc who gave a valuable key and a starting-point to
          the modern documentary analysis of the Pentateuch by his essay
          published in 1753. Another Catholic clergyman who figures
          prominently among the pioneers in the field of scientific
          Biblical study is the Scotchman Alexander Geddes (1737-1802; see
          [380]Geddes, Alexander). Foremost among modern and contemporary
          Catholic scholars who have distinguished themselves in the field
          of Biblical criticism must be placed the abbé [381]A. F. Loisy,
          who to a vast erudition and a remarkably keen critical acumen
          has unfortunately joined a sarcasm of exposition and a rashness
          of speculation which have brought him into serious disfavor with
          the authorities of the Church. The more moderate school of
          Catholic Biblical scholars includes a relatively large and ever
          growing number of adherents who, always subject to the
          limitations imposed by church authority, frankly accept the
          well-authenticated results of scientific critical investigation.
          Obviously these scholars are not so free and independent in
          their researches as their non-Catholic brethren, but Catholic
          apologists claim that while the restrictions imposed do at times
          curtail unduly the freedom of investigators whose views though
          correct may not harmonize with traditionally received opinions,
          they serve, on the other hand, as a salutary check on critical
          speculations of the more radical and advanced type.

          Moved by the acute controversies which, within the last quarter
          of a. century have grown up in the field of Bible study and
          caused so much alarm in most of the orthodox communions, Pope
          Leo XIII instituted a Biblical Commission which was to be a
          standing tribunal composed of Scripture specialists and
          theologians, for the settlement on scientific as well as
          authoritative grounds of the various knotty questions raised by
          higher criticism. Under the present pope, however, while the
          number of members and consultors of this tribunal was greatly
          augmented, a large majority was conceded to the theologians as
          distinguished from the Biblical scholars; and the decisions
          rendered thus far have little or no interest for the scientific
          world, as they constitute simply a reaffirmation, without
          specified reasons, of the traditional positions. In the Church
          at present the trend of authoritative direction as regards the
          Scriptures is unfavorable to Biblical criticism, as is plain
          from the Syllabus of Modern Errors and the encyclical against
          Modernism issued by Pius X in 1907 (see [382]Syllabus).

  BIBLICAL HISTORY, INSTRUCTION IN:

    Conditions Before the Reformation.

          Fundamental to all Christian teaching and attainment, especially
          according to the Protestant view, is a knowledge of the Bible;
          and this knowledge naturally begins with the characters, events,
          and institutions of the Bible--a sum total of knowledge which
          may be comprehended under the general expression Bible history.
          Thence the individual is led on to the weightier matters of
          Christian doctrine and the manner of the Christian life. The
          organized and premeditated efforts of the earlier Church to
          impart Christian instruction (See [385]Catechumenate;
          [386]Catechesis, Catechetics; [387]Catechisms; [388]Homiletics;
          etc.) aimed more directly at the latter, assuming that the
          former already existed. In the New Testament, knowledge of Old
          Testament history is presupposed. This knowledge was
          communicated at home (II Tim. iii, 15) or by readings at public
          services (I Tim. iv, 13). The aim of a portion of the New
          Testament Scripture (the Gospels and Acts) was to keep alive in
          the congregations the knowledge of the New Testament history. In
          the primitive Church, besides public service, home training
          (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., vi, 2; Chrysostom on Eph. vi, 4) and
          private reading (Cyril, Catech., iv, 35; Apostolic
          Constitutions, vii, 39) were means of imparting Biblical history
          to beginners in Christianity. During the Middle Ages no
          systematic school instruction in Biblical history could be
          furnished for lack of common schools, and self-instruction was
          not possible for the people because the Bible was commonly in
          Latin and costly, and but few of the laity could read even the
          works provided for them in their mother tongue (See [389]Bibles,
          Historical). The great mass were limited to the translations by
          preachers of the texts of their sermons, or narrations of Bible
          stories in the sermon; also, scenes especially from the life of
          Jesus or dramatic spectacles from the Biblical record helped to
          preserve in the lay world the knowledge of Biblical essentials
          (see [390]Religious Dramas). In Reformation time as well as in
          the following centuries, there was no general systematic
          schooling in Biblical history; the common-school system was as
          yet a merely formative conception, and text-books of Bible
          history (for list cf. Reu) were designed for higher schools or
          for the home.

    Biblical Instruction in Schools.

          Not until Christian common schools were introduced did
          instruction in Biblical history become a systematized branch of
          public education. Among the text-books thus used may be
          mentioned the Biblische Historien of Justus Gesenius (1656), and
          the Zweimal 52 auserlesenen biblischen Historien of Johann
          Hübner (1714). These books are the prototypes of modern German
          manuals, and such manuals have now generally taken the place of
          the Bible, from which in earlier times Biblical history, was
          taught by reading aloud. The Roman Catholic Church also teaches
          Biblical history; a text-book widely in vogue was that of
          Christoph von Schmid (d. 1856). At present the Bible histories
          of the Catholics are combined with their diocesan catechisms.
          Their new catechism, which according to the desire of Plus X is
          to become the Catholic standard or uniform catechism (Compendio
          della dottrina christiana, 1905), contains a Breve storia della
          religione. It thus appears that modern Churches, in contrast
          with the primitive Church, have reached the conviction that
          catechumens should gain the necessary amount of knowledge of
          Bible history not immediately from the Bible, but from a
          text-book prepared for this educational object. But the fact is
          still more significant that the Churches are convinced of the
          necessity of a knowledge of Biblical history.

    Methods and Principals.

          This conviction rests on the knowledge that Christian belief is
          the product of a history which came to pass between God and
          humanity, and that the knowledge and understanding of this
          salvation on the part of individual Christians must proceed from
          acquaintance with this history. The selection of Bible stories
          for catechumens is adapted to this principle. The various
          manuals of Biblical history deviate from one another in details
          of selection, but are in substantial agreement in the matter of
          setting forth the main events of sacred history according to
          their historical succession. An exception occurs in the case of
          compilations intended for children who are not yet catechetical
          scholars; for these there is need of particular Bible narratives
          adapted to the years of childhood and related to the church
          festivals. With reference to the connection between instruction
          in Biblical history and instruction in the catechism, a change
          has come about, since in earlier times instruction in the former
          had practically no independent significance, but was designed to
          subserve the catechism; the contrary situation, however, obtains
          today, certain modern instructors making Biblical history the
          main issue, while catechetical scholars are confined to the
          fundamentally illustrative or especially adapted Biblical
          relations. Concerning the method of instruction, there is a
          consensus of modern conviction to the effect that the textbook
          should coincide as far as possible with the wording of the Bible
          as generally in use. The earlier method of reading the narrative
          from the Bible, or having it read aloud by a pupil, has been
          discarded. It is better to have a story related by the teacher;
          and the preferable method is that his oral discourse should
          adhere altogether or with close approximation to the phrasing of
          the textbook. In particular the decisive and striking utterances
          of the dramatis personæ should be reproduced exactly.
          Opportunity for explanation and application is afforded by the
          subsequent discussion. The use of maps and pictures, with which
          modern Biblical text-books are provided, tends to give the
          matter more of an objective background, but pictures are not so
          necessary as they formerly were, when pupils had fewer books.
          [In the United States, religious instruction being necessarily
          excluded from the public schools, the teaching of Bible history
          belongs to the Church and the home. See [391]Sunday Schools.]

I. Old Testament.

  1. Nature and Scope of the Discipline.

          The science of Old Testament Introduction, like that of Biblical
          Introduction in general, has developed from indefinite
          beginnings, and has not yet won the assured and universally
          recognized form which most other theological disciplines have
          assumed. The name eisagOge was used in the fifth century by the
          Syro-Greek monk Adrian, the terms introductorii libri and
          introductores in the sixth by Cassiodorus. But these terms
          carried the meaning of a general and instructive direction how
          to read the Bible, a guide to its correct understanding, an
          exposition of the correct principles of exegesis. A complete
          understanding of the Bible involves, however, a number of
          auxiliary sciences--linguistics, exegesis, history of
          literature, general history, archeology, geography, Biblical
          theology, etc., all useful in obtaining a right apprehension of
          Scripture. But so large a conception of the science was not
          reached all at once. It was J. G. Carpzov who first appreciated
          the comprehensive nature of the discipline and defined it as the
          precise setting forth of those matters a knowledge of which
          prepares the approach to the reading of the sacred books.
          Similarly DeWette understood by Introduction all knowledge which
          contributed to the intelligent reading of the Bible, and which
          set it forth as a whole and in its parts in relation to history.
          Keil regarded it as an exposition of those matters the
          understanding of which prepares for a fruitful reading of
          Scripture, by which he understands only a history of the text,
          of the origin of the individual writings, the story of the rise
          of the canon, and of the general conception of Scripture. A new
          start was made by H. Hupfeld, who held that Introduction sought
          to discover what were the writings embraced in the Bible and how
          they had come to be what they are. In other words, what is
          sought are the extent and original character of the writings,
          and a knowledge of the vicissitudes through which they have
          passed in attaining their present form, unity, worth, and
          effectiveness. But care is needed in following such a
          formulation lest one make of Old Testament Introduction simply a
          history of Hebrew literature, a mistake made by Reuss, who
          included in his work the letter of Aristeas and the writings of
          Philo. The first consideration of this science must be its
          service to theology; its principal concern is with the books of
          the canon held by the Jews of Palestine, and only secondarily
          with the circle of writings derived from Hellenistic sources.
          Care must also be taken not to limit the task of Introduction so
          as to take away its freedom and to bind it in effect to the
          pronouncements of tradition as to authorship. On the other hand,
          Introduction is not what Riehm would make it, the
          literary-historical characterization of the Bible as the
          authentification of a divine revelation. It has its own
          functions to perform in the service of theological science, and
          its usefulness must not be diminished by setting it at tasks
          which it may not undertake. Its work is a preparation for that
          of exegesis and for that of Biblical theology. As Reuss has well
          expressed the fact, the science of Introduction is not the house
          itself, but is the set of calculations and estimates necessary
          for the actual processes of building.

  2. Method of Treatment.

          From the preceding it follows that the articulation of this
          discipline in the general science of theology is fixed. In the
          arrangement and handling of its subject-matter it demands and
          requires great freedom; on the other hand, certain lines are
          laid down along which it must operate. Thus, while the origin of
          the separate writings and the story of their transmission
          (history of the text) are its concern, it is a matter of choice
          whether consideration of the individual writings precede or
          follow consideration of their collection into a canon. Not
          unimportant is the question of method of investigating the
          individual writings. Thus, the chronological order certainly
          lies near to hand, as in the treatment by Wildeboer and
          Kautzsch; yet, illuminating as this method is, weighty
          considerations may be urged for another way of proceeding. If
          one is disposed to emphasize the theological character of the
          discipline, concentrating his attention upon the writings
          received into the canon, the chronological, historical-literary
          order assumes a complexion of incompleteness, since only a small
          part of Hebrew literature found place in the canon and that part
          was not composed with the object of being gathered into a
          collection. By a simpler grouping the advantage is gained of
          awakening no expectations which are doomed to disappointment.
          Then, too, there are practical difficulties attending such a
          method. Over the origin of most Old Testament writings rests a
          darkness not yet dispelled and probably never wholly to be
          banished. Moreover, many of the writings, such as the historical
          books, are complex in origin, and refer to preceding
          compositions of which too little is known to admit of their
          being taken into a history of the literature. These same books
          also bear traces of being transmitted and worked over by hands
          the methods of operation of which are altogether uncertain. This
          historical method consequently leads frequently into a
          cul-de-sac. It is, therefore, not without reason that many have
          adopted the literary-historical method, following the grouping
          of the canon so far as to consider the historical books by
          themselves, the Prophets in another section, and so on, while
          the three departments of Introduction are history of the canon,
          of the separate books, and of the text. Whether a history of
          exegesis is to be included in this branch of study is debatable.
          For the history of the Bible in a narrower sense it is not
          important; yet in itself and its relationship it has such value
          that there is some justification for including in Introduction
          what properly belongs in hermeneutics.

  3. History.

          The history of this science shows in all its phases the same
          marked trait; viz., that the Church, which would fair remain in
          restful and thankful enjoyment of the Scriptures as handed down,
          has been compelled by outside pressure to take up the problems
          of the origins of those Scriptures and either to modify or
          discard the traditions regarding them. In the earliest times
          this pressure came partly from Jewish sources, later from
          linguistic science and philosophy, and later still from the
          Roman Catholic Church, which sought to undermine the Protestant
          principle. Only the salient points of the development of
          Introduction can be here given.

  4. To the Renaissance.

          The beginnings are found in the treatment of the canon in the
          prologue to Ecclesiasticus, in Josephus and the Talmud, and in
          the controversy between the Jews and some of the Church Fathers
          respecting the Palestinian and the Alexandrian canon. This led
          up to the text-critical labors of Origen. The next name is that
          of Jerome, about whose time began work on Introduction, but with
          the limits is treatment already referred to above, by Adrian and
          Casaiodorus, the latter of whom dealt briefly with the history
          of the text and of the canon. A slight advance was made in the
          work of Junilius Africanus (about 550) called Instituta
          regularia divinæ legis. This classified the books according to
          their contents as history, prophecy, proverbs, and simple
          teaching, and according to their degree of authority as perfect,
          medium, or of no authority; it distinguished also between
          poetical and prose writings. In this connection must be
          mentioned Augustine's De doctrina Christiana, which treated of
          the extent of the canon and of the use of translations. The
          Church of the Middle Ages was content with the work done by
          Cassiodorus, Augustine, and Junilius. But among the Jews there
          were the stirrings of a more vigorous life, exemplified in the
          investigations of Ibn Ezra in the region of special
          introduction.

  5. The Reformation Period.

          By the revival of learning the Christians were made familiar
          with the results of Jewish investigations which were soon to
          lead to the enrichment of isagogical science. The interest in
          the Hebrew language grew into a wider concern for Oriental
          philology, which had a fertile field in the translations of the
          Old Testament, soon to become of use in the department of
          text-criticism. The earliest fruits ripened among the Roman
          Catholics in the work of a convert from Judaism, Sixtus of
          Sienna (d. 1599), the Bibliotheca sancta, which distinguished
          between protocanonical and deuterocanonical writings, and which
          dealt also with matters of special introduction. The Reformers
          did not enter this field, though the exegetical works of Calvin
          contain materials for special introduction, and Luther
          necessarily had to do with the extent of the canon. Important
          was the work of Carlstadt, De canonicis scripturis (1520), in
          which he showed the superiority of the Jewish canon and made the
          canonicity of a Biblical writing depend not upon the authorship
          but upon its relation to that canon. The period immediately
          following the Reformation produced nothing notable. A. Rivetus
          (d. 1662) represents the standpoint of the age in his definition
          of Scripture as that which proceeds from God as the special
          author, who not only impelled (the scribe) to write and gave the
          thoughts, but even suggested the order and the words.

  6. The Seventeenth Century.

          Out of this dogmatic quiet the theologians were shaken by the
          newer criticism, which began in the realm of the text. The
          Reformer Cappellus undertook investigations which showed that
          the traditional text was not altogether trustworthy, and he was
          followed by the Catholics Morinus and Richard Simon (d, 1712).
          The latter's Histoire critique was epoch-making in that it
          employed the literary-historical method, and showed that the
          Pentateuch could not be wholly the work of Moses and that other
          historical books had been worked over. Simon had been preceded
          by Hobbes, whose Leviathan had used the method of internal
          testimony, and Spinoza, whose Tractatus theologico-politicus had
          advanced a number of positions which were to be established
          later. Simon's book awakened much opposition and was suppressed,
          only to be reproduced in a Protestant land (Rotterdam, 1685).
          The ideas of Simon were further established in Protestant
          regions by the work of [392]Johannes Clericus, though the
          tendencies of Protestantism were conservative, and its
          supporters came later to hope that the learning of Carpzov would
          establish firmly the truth of the traditional views.

  7. The Eighteenth Century.

          In the second half of the eighteenth century new doors were
          opened to Biblical criticism, especially by the researches of
          Semler. At that time the attitude of criticism toward the Old
          Testament was unfriendly; it treated the collection from the
          historical standpoint only, but insisted upon understanding the
          times in which the writings originated. Of religion little was
          discovered in the Old Testament. Herder came to the help of the
          defenders of the Bible with his discovery of the poetry it
          contained, and this newer light was intensified in the work of
          Eichhorn, which outshone all the works of his predecessors and
          contemporaries. Special interest attaches to the researches of
          Eichhorn in general introduction, while the work of special
          introduction gained from his treatment of the books as
          constituting a Hebrew national literature. Yet permanent results
          were lacking from that period, excepting only the discovery by
          Astruc which forecast the documentary analysis of the
          Pentateuch.

  8. The Nineteenth Century.

          A new era was opened by De Wette, who combined the literary with
          the historical method. Ewald carried the process on, not indeed
          in a work on Introduction, but in exegetical researches in which
          he employed it, using along with it a sympathetic appreciation
          rather than a rigid logic. Meanwhile the Pentateuchal problem
          was pushing to the front in the works of Vatke and Reuss, to
          receive its most advanced consideration from Wellhausen and
          Kuenen. The side of the defense had meanwhile not been inactive,
          as the works of Hengstenberg, Hävernick, and Keil abundantly
          prove, all of which contributed something toward the solution of
          the problems discussed. Between the two extremes represented by
          the men named come others who approach one or the other
          tendency, but the general characteristic of their labor is to
          bring into accord the assured results of criticism and the faith
          of the Church in revelation. The most notable example of this
          kind of work is Driver's Introduction. But the final solution of
          the problems raised by the science of Introduction will come not
          from that discipline but from the other branches of theology
          which build upon it.

          (F. Buhl.)

II. New Testament.

  1. History of the Discipline.

    1. To the Reformation.

          The employment of the term "Introduction" with its present
          connotation in connection with the New Testament dates in modern
          times from Michaelis. But as in the case of the Old Testament,
          beginnings had been made long before. Besides the men mentioned
          above ([393]I, § 4) as working in this department, Tyconius and
          Eucherius of Lyons attempted to supply the needed information
          about the origin, occasion, purpose, and history of the New
          Testament writings. The antagonism to the apocryphal books and
          heretical parties such as the Marcionites with their variant
          canon and the Montanists with their new prophecy enhanced in the
          second and third centuries the Church's valuation of the
          Christian books which had come to it from the apostolic age. The
          Muratorian Canon employed a legendary report of the origin of
          the Gospels, not to explain individual peculiarities, but to
          establish the dogmatic unimportance of variations in the Gospel
          narratives. Similarly, the church practice of using in service
          the private letters of Paul as well as the public letters and of
          excluding the spurious ones from use was established. The
          vacillation of the Church in reference to such writings as the
          Apocalypse of Peter and the Sheperd of Herman, the Marcionitic
          criticism of the canon of the Gospels and of the Pauline
          epistles, the opposition of the Alogi to the Johannine writings
          as being the production of a heretic of the apostolic age, the
          writings of Melitus and Hippolytus about the Fourth Gospel and
          the Apocalypse--all these suggest the way in which the need for
          a kind of Introduction made itself felt in even those early
          times. So a beginning was made in the writing of Dionysius on
          the Apocalypse, while the sentiments and traditions of the
          different Churches began to take systematic form in the writings
          of Origen. Eusebius used considerable space in his works in
          setting forth the varied views and early testimonies concerning
          the New Testament books. Jerome followed in the steps of
          Eusebius, but without contributing much that was new in this
          particular line of investigation. The doctrinal contests of the
          fourth and succeeding centuries turned the channel of
          investigation away from the history of the canon, and for a
          considerable time there appeared only reproductions of the early
          opinions about the New Testament books in the prefaces to the
          commentaries or summaries and synopses which came into being and
          which gave a general view of the arrangement, contents, and
          origin of the New Testament writings.

    2. The Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries.

          The silence of the Middle Ages gave place during the Reformation
          to the utterances of the Catholic scholars Sanctes Pagninus of
          Lucca (d. 1541), Sixtus of Sienna (d. 1599), and A. Rivetus, who
          wrote an Isagoge sive introductio to both the Old and New
          Testaments (Leyden, 1627). These works contained much
          information in this department, along with dogmatic discussions
          concerning inspiration and the relations of Scripture and
          tradition. [394]Richard Simon published (at Rotterdam) his three
          works upon the critical history of the New Testament (Histoire
          critique du texte, 1689, des versions, 1690, and des principaux
          commentateurs, 1693, du Nouveau Testament), and thus won his
          place as the father of New Testament Introduction. By "critique"
          he understood the investigations for the establishment of the
          original text; and, by his history from the sources, he impugned
          not only the Protestant claim of "a witness of the Spirit," but
          also the scholastic treatment, which, resting upon imperfect
          acquaintance with antiquity, could not prove that Christianity
          was a religion based on facts and that the Bible was the record
          of those facts. In the effort to establish the New Testament
          text, he traversed a large part of the province of Introduction.

    3. Michaelis.

          The next name is [395]Johann David Michaelis, who wrote the
          Einleitung in die göttlichen Schriften des Neuen Bundes
          (Göttingen, 1750). He disclaimed dependency upon Simon, and yet
          his work was really, in its first shape, based upon Simon. With
          each succeeding edition it was greatly improved; but, even in
          the fourth and last edition (1788), its standpoint was a
          strongly rational supernaturalism. The differences to be noted
          between the editions are mainly that his attacks on the
          "doubters" became milder, and that he gave up the inspiration of
          the historical books, denied also the inspiration of the
          non-apostolic books (among which he reckoned apparently the
          Epistle to the Hebrews), and declared that the "inner witness of
          the Spirit" was of as little worth as the witness of the Church
          in proof of the inspiration of any book.

    4. Semler, Schmidt, and Others.

          [396]Johann Salomo Semler made the next contribution of
          importance (in his Abhandlung von freier Untersuchung des
          Kanons, 4 parts, Halle, 1771-75), when he distinguished between
          the word of God, which contained the doctrines of directly
          spiritual value, and the Holy Scriptures, which contained them
          only sporadically. There is, however, no historical proof that
          any particular passage was the word of God; the inner witness
          for the truth was the only source of proof. The Church had the
          right, exercised by the ancient Church and by the Reformers, to
          say what books should constitute the canon. It can not be said
          that Introduction was influenced permanently by Semler; the
          greater impulse was given by Michaelis, who was followed by J.
          E. C. Schmidt (1804), Eichhorn (1804-14), Hug (1808), Berthold
          (1812), and De Wette (1826), while in England Horne (1818) had
          included in his work the domains of Biblical geography and
          antiquities, which were excluded by the Germans. Schmidt applied
          the phrase "historico-critical"--since so widely used--to his
          Introduction; Eichhorn started his fruitful "original Gospel"
          theory; Hug, in an unexcelled manner, investigated the relations
          of the synoptists. Schleiermacher (1811) called attention to the
          need of a reconstruction of this branch of study, declaring that
          its object was a history of the New Testament, so that its
          present readers might be, in their knowledge of the origin of
          the books and their text, on a level with the first. Credner
          (1832 sqq.) projected a fairly complete scheme for a treatment
          of the subject, embracing the history of the science of
          Introduction, history of the origin of the New Testament
          Scriptures, history of the canon, of translations, of the text,
          and of interpretation. This scheme he was not permitted to carry
          out, though his posthumous publications completed the history of
          the canon. Reuss followed Credner's lead in the Geschichte der
          heiligen Schriften des Neuen Testaments (Brunswick, 1842), while
          Hupfeld made a contribution in his Begriff und Methode der . . .
          biblischen Einleitung (Marburg, 1844).

    5. Baur.

          [397]Ferdinand Christian Baur (d. 1860) has had by far the most
          influence upon New Testament studies of any man of modern times.
          He attempted nothing less than a reconstruction of all apostolic
          and postapostolic history and literature, from the four Pauline
          epistles (Galatians, I and II Corinthians, and Romans) which
          alone he considered genuine. Starting with the idea that the
          difference between Paul and the rest of the apostles was
          fundamental, he declared that those New Testament writings which
          either put the relations of the apostles in a more favorable
          light or seemed to ignore their differences altogether were
          either forgeries or the products of a later time. But his
          historical considerations were derived from Hegel's philosophy,
          and his criticism rested upon dogmatic convictions. New
          discoveries of vital importance in the field of church history
          and patristics and the recovery of the Codex Sinaiticus and of
          parts of Tatian's Diatessaron from Ephraem's commentary have
          given a new basis for a historical discussion of the New
          Testament and its origin and contents. It is the irony of
          history upon Baur's methods that the modern Dutch school have
          used Baur's methods to discredit the four "genuine" epistles.
          These four points may be made against Baur: (1) He reasoned in a
          circle; for he examined critically, first the sources of the
          history, and then the history of the sources. The reasoning
          which reduced the genuine Pauline epistles to four reduces the
          four to none; so that Paul is robbed of his title to have
          produced any writing which lasted. (2) Baur certainly was
          extraordinarily familiar with the old Christian literature; but
          he read it with prejudice, and not with a desire to learn
          anything different from his preconceptions. (3) He was lacking
          in the sense of the concrete and the value of the individual,
          and therefore could not grasp complicated relations and their
          results. (4) If it is self-evident that one must understand what
          he criticizes, and that his criticism must rest upon thorough
          exegesis, then Baur surely was unfitted for his labor; for he
          was weak as an exegete and his school has done little in
          exegesis.

    6. Later Work.

          It may, however, be added that the deficiencies in Baur's method
          of work were supplied by others. B. F. Westcott's General Survey
          of the History of the Canon (London, 1855 and often), E. Reuss's
          Histoire du canon (Strasburg, 1863), A. Hilgenfeld's Kanon und
          die Kritik des Neuen Testaments (Halle, 1863), T. Zahn's
          Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons (2 vols., Leipsic,
          1888-92), and A. Loisy's Histoire du canon du Nouveau Testament
          (Paris, 1891) are productions of this character. Such works as
          W. M. Ramsay's Church in the Roman Empire (London, 1893) have
          served also as correctives of much of the work which has been
          accomplished in Germany. The studies of F. Bleek (6th ed., 1893;
          Eng. transl. of 2d Germ. ed., 1869), Hilgenfeld (1875),
          Holtzmann (1892), Salmon (1894), S. Davidson (1894), Godet
          (1893-99; Eng, transl. 1894-99), Zahn (1900), and Jülicher
          (1901; Eng. transl, 1904), and of the Roman Catholics Trenkle
          (1897) and Schäfer (1898) in Introduction are important
          contributions to the science.

  2. The Conception and the Task.

    1. History of the New Testament Scriptures.

          In order to obtain an adequate comprehension of the books which
          together make up the New Testament as witnesses for a historical
          movement and to secure for them safe utilization as historic
          sources, there is required a scientific investigation of their
          origin. That is, there must be inquiry into the time in which,
          the circumstances under which, the purpose for which, and the
          personal relations of the persons by whom they were produced. In
          other words, the method of research is literary-historical.
          Whether this can be called a science is debatable, since
          criticism is the art of distinguishing the genuine from the
          spurious. But if it be granted that an examination from a
          historical standpoint of the writings of the New Testament and
          an adequate exposition of the history of their origin is really
          scientific, it is none the less a fact that the process has a
          theological character. For the fact that this literature is
          Greek and sprang up in the Roman world does not do away with the
          other fact that it originated in certain communities which had
          in certain vital respects their existence apart from the world
          about them. The religious element marks it off from the other
          productions of the time, and the history of this literature is
          one aide of the history of the Church. If Christianity depends
          upon the historic reality of a revelation mediated by Christ and
          authoritatively expounded by the apostles, it is no unimportant
          result that it can reach historical foundations for the early
          productions. And those foundations are found in the writings
          brought together in the New Testament. The supereminent value in
          this respect of these writings is sufficient justification for
          considering them apart. But the investigation must not start
          from a dogmatic conception of what the canon is. The ground fact
          is that even from the second century this collection has existed
          in the Church and has been accepted as the one legitimate source
          for the history of the revelation made through Christ. But if it
          should appear that there are in the New Testament writings which
          in general character and in origin separate themselves widely
          from the rest of the New Testament Scriptures, or if there were
          outside that collection writings which affiliate themselves with
          the New Testament Scriptures, Introduction can not content
          itself with disregarding those facts. It is hardly likely,
          however, that such discoveries will be made as will compel a
          radical departure from the accepted procedure, that there will
          come to light such writings as are referred to in Luke i, 1
          sqq., or the correspondence of Paul with the Corinthians implied
          in I Cor. v, 9; vii, 1. Even such discoveries as those last
          mentioned would not be likely materially to change accepted
          results, and the business of the discipline would still be with
          the New Testament Scriptures.

    2. History of the Canon.

          Along with the history of the separate writings which make up
          the New Testament goes as a second part the history of the
          combination of these into the canon in which they have been
          transmitted to the present time. It is of importance to examine
          and exhibit the historical antecedents and developments which
          compassed the formation of this collection, the irregularity and
          vacillation which existed during several centuries, and the
          adjustment which produced a final and universally accepted
          result.

          The examination of the origins of the individual writings and
          that of the origin of the collection supplement each other. The
          one brings to light the common spirit which animated the
          individual writers, the other reveals the influence which those
          writers exercised over the churches. And it is noteworthy that
          the collection was begun almost, if not quite, before the latest
          writers had finished their work, so that no appreciable interval
          of time separated the two operations of writing and of
          collection. And so, notwithstanding the different areas in which
          these two processes work, they belong together as sections of
          the one discipline of the literary history of the New Testament.

    3. Textual Criticism and Versions.

          As to the inclusion of other departments in this branch of
          study, usage differs. Some have included therein not only the
          history of the text and of translations, but also the history of
          the theological handling of the same. But, strictly speaking,
          neither the story of the vicissitudes of transmission nor the
          history of translations belongs here. If with Credner and Reuss
          the history of translations is put as a part of the history of
          the propagation of the New Testament, its proper place is in the
          history of missions. So far as the versions assist in the
          recovery of the original text, the treatment of them belongs in
          a guide to the exercise of text-criticism or in the prolegomena
          to editions of the New Testament. To be sure, the history of the
          earlier text and that of the old versions have importance for
          the history of the canon because of the fact that not so much
          individual books as the entire collection or at least great
          parts of the collection were copied and translated. Were greater
          certainty than is yet the case attainable concerning the Syriac
          and the Latin versions, great gains would be made in the history
          of the canon of the New Testament. But it must be remembered
          that not all branches which contribute to results in any given
          line of research are to be included in the department of science
          in which they are used.

          Biblical theology, or the orderly presentation of the doctrinal
          contents of Scripture, is a comparatively modern branch of
          theological science. In general the term expresses not so much
          the construction of a theology which is Biblical in an especial
          sense as a method of dealing with the Biblical matter which is
          midway between exegesis and dogmatics. Its object and limitation
          can be shown best by tracing its history.

    1. Origin and History.

          So long as the Church felt or admitted no discord between its
          tradition and the Biblical tradition, there was no need to
          compare or contrast the contents of the Bible with the teaching
          of the Church. On this account the beginnings of a Biblical
          theology appear in the circles of the theologians of the
          Reformation, who perceived in Scripture the test by which to try
          ecclesiastical tradition. Since to them the Bible was the
          sufficient, self-explaining basis of dogmatics, by this
          juxtaposition the possibility was given of a separate treatment
          of the doctrinal contents of the Bible. The first timid effort
          confined itself to a discussion of the customary quotations
          (Sebastian Schmidt, Collegium Biblicum in quo dicta Veteris et
          Novi Testamenti juxta seriem locorum . . . explicantur, 1671).
          Under the influence of Pietism the close connection of dogmatics
          and the Bible was relaxed, because in the latter was seen less
          an infallible source of knowledge than a means of grace (A. F.
          Büsching, Gedanken von der Beschaffenheit und dem Vorzuge der
          bibl.-dogm. Theologie von der scholastischen, Lemgo, 1758, and
          similar works). When in the eighteenth century J. S. Semler and
          his school busied themselves in discovering the differences in
          date and characteristics of the different books of the Bible,
          and brought to light the dissonance between crystallized dogma
          and New Testament teaching (a dissonance greater still in the
          case of the Old Testament), the desire naturally arose to show
          the essential agreement of the teaching of the Church and that
          of the Bible by an unprejudiced study of the latter (G. T.
          Zachariä, Biblische Theologie oder Untersuchtung des biblischen
          Grundes der vornehmsten kirchlichen Lehren, 5 vols., Göttingen,
          1771-86). The rationalistic school, in opposition to the
          formulated dogma of the Church, endeavored to read its own views
          (those of natural religion) into the Bible (C. F. Ammon,
          Entwicklung einer reinen biblischen Theologie, Erlangen, 1792;
          G. P. C. Kaiser, Die biblische Theologie oder Judaismus und
          Christianismus nach einer freimütigen Stellung in die
          kritisch-vergleichende Universalgeschichte der Religionen und in
          die universale Religion, 2 vols., Erlangen, 1813). In
          contradistinction to this there was during the nineteenth
          century an eager desire to give the purely historical results of
          examination of the Bible. In this way, the fact of differences
          of conception in the parts of the Bible was fully brought to
          light.

    2. Study of New Testament Theology.

          Probably under the influence of [398]Schleiermacher especial
          attention was directed to the New Testament, and the "systems"
          of the different apostles were separately treated (the Pauline
          by Meyer, 1801, L. Usteri, 1824; the Johannine by K. Frommann,
          1839). Along with this an effort was made to show the unity of
          the Gospel in the very variety of individual conceptions (of the
          many important works, note A. Neander, Geschichte der Pflanzung
          . . . der christlichen Kirche, Hamburg, 1832; B. Weiss, Lehrbuch
          der biblischen Theologie, Berlin, 1868; W. Beyschlag,
          Neutestamentliche Theologie, Halle, 1891). At the same time
          another class of theologians was eagerly engaged in tracing the
          differences of the individual conceptions to their very roots.
          According to Hegel's formula the crystallized dogma was a
          synthesis of the two sharp opposites of Paulinism and the
          primitive apostolate, and this development was followed up in
          all its details from a literary-historical point of view (F. C.
          Baur; H. E. G. Paulus; F. C. A. Schwegler, Nachapostolisches
          Zeitalter, Tübingen, 1846; O. Pfleiderer, Paulinismus, Leipsic,
          1873; C. Holsten, Evangelium des Paulus und Petrus, Rostock,
          1868; A. Hilgenfeld, Urchristentum, Jena, 1854). In like manner
          the life of Jesus and its sources were treated, in connection
          with which work there originated a countless number of
          monographs on the self-consciousness of Jesus and the titles he
          assumed. The result from this point of view was the conviction
          that New Testament theology has to deal not with a completed
          whole, but with a mobile and developing Christianity. Hence
          "Biblical Theology" and "Introduction" together represent simply
          a part of the apparatus of general church history (cf. A.
          Hausrath, Neutestamentliche Zeitgeschichte, Heidelberg, 1868; O.
          Pfleiderer, Urchristentum, Berlin, 1887).

    3. The Old Testament.

          Parallel to this development of New Testament theology was that
          of Old Testament theology. Students came to discern the
          narrowness and one-sidedness of the Old Testament religion, upon
          which Hengstenberg vainly insisted in his obliteration of the
          limits between the Old and the New Testament. In acknowledging
          the principle of slow historical genesis, others sought to
          understand the development of the Old Testament religion by the
          principle that no doctrine is completed in the Old Testament, no
          doctrine in the New Testament is altogether new (G. F. Oehler,
          Theologie des Alten Testaments, Tübingen, 1873-74; similarly
          Schultz and Riehm). J. Wellhausen (Prolegomena zur Geschichte
          Israels, Berlin, 1886) and A. Kuenen produced a revolution in
          the treatment of the Old Testament. Under the influence of their
          religious-historical suppositions and literary-critical
          conclusions, Old Testament theology served to describe how from
          the supposed original conditions, from animism and totemism, the
          prophetic monotheism of the prophets and ultimately the
          theocratic ceremonialism of postexilic Judaism gradually
          developed (B. Duhm, Theologie der Propheten, Bonn, 1875; R.
          Smend, Alttestamentliche Religionsgeschichte, Freiburg, 1893; S.
          Kayser and Marti). In this way the Old Testament religion was
          placed on a level with other religions, and the surprisingly
          rich discoveries concerning the ancient Orient and the rising
          science of the history of religion grasped hands with this
          method of treatment. It was a natural consequence to show that
          the New Testament possesses a rich heritage of religious fancy
          common to ethnic religions (cf. especially H. Gunkel, Schöpfung
          und Chaos, Göttingen, 1895; Religionsgeschichtliche Abhandlung
          des Neuen Testaments, 1904). The idea of unity and special
          individuality of the New Testament thus goes by the board.

    4. Limitations.

          In glancing over the development of Biblical theology, it is
          surprising to see how this branch has worked out its own
          disintegration. In the beginning the aim was to make the Bible
          the only and sole source of Christian doctrine in the Reformers'
          understanding of the phrase, by allowing it to speak for itself
          without introducing any diluting medium. The investigator sought
          to penetrate its polymorphous nature, and finally saw that under
          his touch the uniting bond had disappeared which formerly kept
          together the disparate parts and made it an undivided object of
          scientific research. This self-immolation the discipline owes to
          a one-sided maintenance of the historical and
          religious-historical method. Biblical theology must indeed be a
          historical science; but the adjective must not become a noun and
          the method must not master the subject. For in this study there
          are fundamental perceptions which can not be obtained by
          literary criticism and general historical researches. Thus the
          subject itself--namely, the whole Bible--suggests the question
          whether the subject-matter is the remains of a religious
          literature or documents, productions, and descriptions of a
          history which is fixed by a revelation from God. And the answer
          to this question is of the greatest import for the
          investigation. How different must be the verdict of higher
          criticism, provided the miracles or the declarations of Jesus
          are regarded as a priori historically possible or impossible;
          how much the selection of the matter decides whether one shall
          find only religious-ethical views, or historical facts of the
          "religion of Jesus," or that "the belief in Christ" belongs to
          the essence of Christianity.

    5. Constructive Work.

          For this reason there has always existed an opposition to the
          development described above. The history of salvation with its
          literary deposit ought not to be resolved into a purely human
          development. The impression is gained rather that the Bible
          contains a primary life of faith, having the character of
          uncorrupted self-consistency and unbroken independence, and that
          consequently there is underneath a uniform and fundamental idea.
          As standing for this, mention must be made of K. I. Nitzsch,
          System der christlichen Lehre (Bonn, 1829), and H. Ewald, Lehre
          der Bibel von Gott (3 vols., Leipsic, 1871), and particularly of
          J. C. K. von Hofmann, whose great work (Die heilige Schrift des
          Neuen Testaments zusammenhängend untersucht, completed by Volck,
          Munich, 1886) culminated in the description of the history of
          the entire New Testament preaching as a historical development
          of the uniform word which is not the product of the individual
          authors. Hermann Cremer (Biblisch-theologisches Wörterbuch der
          neutestamentlichen Gräcität, 8th ed., Gotha, 1895) endeavored in
          a new way to bring into view the unity of the contents of
          Scripture by collecting the individual notions of the Bible and
          following their development from the Hebrew into the Greek.
          According to him there are not only different modes of
          expression at different times, but there is a Bible-language, a
          linguistic body of the divine word, ever developing itself. It
          is a scientific necessity that Biblical theology regard the
          individuality of the Bible as the basal principle of its entire
          activity. For the religion of the Bible is not merely a part of
          the historical past; it is an active factor in the present. In
          like manner the Bible is not merely a document showing the
          manner in which the Christian Church originated; it is the
          authentic tradition of the word of God, out of which the Church
          is ever originating (M. Kaehler, Der historische Jesus, 2d ed.,
          Leipsic, 1896). On this account Biblical theology must always
          proceed from the unexceptionable agreement, which can only be
          reached at the end of a development; its way leads, therefore,
          from the New to the Old Testament, through the whole to the
          parts. Since, however, that result is nowhere offered in
          complete form, it is the task of this branch to educe from that
          which exists what is essential--the entirety--so that the
          examination of the particular is ever a means to an end, and is
          always under the control of the final aim of the work.

    6. The True Aim.

          Accordingly it is not the task of Biblical theology to criticize
          the theology of the Bible and to judge it by the measure of a
          probable understanding of the original to be obtained
          scientifically, but to show as a matter of fact what the
          contents of the Bible are and at the same time to bring into
          view the different forms and shapes in which these contents are
          offered. It owes to the Church a pure exhibition of the "word"
          by the preaching of which the Church has lived in all ages. On
          this account no help is gained by considering some "probable
          gospel of Jesus," sought behind the sources, but the necessity
          is that the Jesus Christ of primitive tradition be described,
          and that in the various forms in which it has been handed down.
          Again, the highest aim is always to produce a theology of the
          entire Bible (such an effort is K. Schlottmann, Kompendium der
          biblischen Theologie, 2d ed., Leipsic, 1895). But the separate
          treatment of the Testaments will generally recommend itself for
          practical reasons, since a great deal of preliminary work is
          necessary on the Old Testament, and because the difference of
          degrees of revelation must be indicated. But the correlation
          between the two must, after all, never be overlooked. It is a
          matter of course that the Biblical theology of the whole Bible
          can never dispense with exegesis. But it raises itself above the
          purely exegetical by its relation to systematic theology. It is
          released from the duty of exhibiting all the mazes and changes
          of development which are not essential to the understanding of
          the unified whole. On the other hand, it must not be misled into
          compressing Biblical riches into a narrow, one-sided system,
          which will take the form of contemporary dogmatics, for the
          dogmatic interest will take charge of the process of digesting
          the immense amount of subject-matter. One task of Biblical
          theology is to open the way of return from contemporary
          crystallization into formulas in dogmatics to the source itself.
          In this sense it will be of very great service to evangelical
          theology, provided it directs us to disclose more clearly and
          richly God's word in Holy Scripture and thus protests in the
          name of the document of revelation against every claim of human
          infallibility, for "God alone is infallible" (Zwingli).

   Biblicists, Biblical Doctors
          BIBLICISTS, BIBLICAL DOCTORS: A name sometimes given to those
          who, during the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries,
          demonstrated religious truths by the Scriptures and by the
          authority of the Fathers, in contrast to others, who abandoned
          Scripture and tradition in order to give full rein to their
          fancy and philosophy. The most of the latter were Dominican and
          Franciscan monks who, since their orders held no property, had
          no libraries, and, owing to their unsettled and vagrant lives,
          had little opportunity for the study of books. Some of the
          Biblical doctors were scholars, and produced valuable works; but
          the majority of them were servile imitators of their
          predecessors.

   Bickersteth, Edward
          BICKERSTETH, EDWARD: The name of three clergymen of the Church
          of England.

          1. A leader of the Evangelicals; b. at Kirkby Lonsdale (60 m. n.
          of Liverpool), Westmoreland, Mar. 19, 1786; d. at Watton (21 m.
          w.s.w. of Norwich), Hertfordshire, Feb. 28, 1850. He was at
          first a lawyer and practised at Norwich, but he was always of
          deeply religious temperament and in 1815 received priest's
          orders and was sent to Africa by the Church Missionary Society
          to inspect the work there. Returning in Aug., 1816, he became
          one of the society's secretaries and for the rest of his life
          spent much time traveling in the service of the society; in 1830
          he became rector of Watton. He was an active opponent of the
          Tractarian Movement, and was one of the founders of the
          Evangelical Alliance and of the Irish Church Missions Society.
          His published works were numerous and many were very popular;
          the more important (A Help to the Study of the Scriptures, 21st
          edition; A Treatise on Prayer, 14th edition; A Treatise on the
          Lord's Supper, 13th edition; A Guide to the Prophecies, 8th
          edition; and others) were collected in sixteen volumes (London,
          1853). He also compiled Christian Psalmody (Hereford, 1833), a
          much-used hymn-book, and edited the Christian's Family Library
          (50 vols.).

          2. Dean of Lichfield, nephew of the preceding; b. at Acton (12
          m, s. by e. of Bury St. Edmund's), Suffolk, Oct. 23, 1814; d. at
          Leamington (80 m. n.w. of London) Oct. 7, 1892. He studied at
          Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge (B.A., 1836; M.A., 1839; D.D.,
          1864), and at Durham University; became curate of Chetton,
          Shropshire, 1838; at the Abbey, Shrewsbury, 1839; Penn Street,
          Buckinghamshire, 1849; vicar of Aylesbury and archdeacon of
          Buckinghamshire, 1853; honorary canon of Christ Church, Oxford,
          1866; dean of Lichfield, 1875; resigned in 1892. In 1864, 1866,
          1869, and 1874 he was prolocutor of the lower house of
          convocation of Canterbury, and as such was a member of the
          committee of New Testament revisers. He was a High-churchman. He
          published Diocesan Synods in Relation to Convocation and
          Parliament (London, 1867); My Hereafter (1883); edited the fifth
          edition of R. W. Evans's Bishopric of Souls (1877), with a
          memoir of the author; and contributed the commentary on Mark to
          the Pulpit Commentary (1882).

          3. Bishop of South Tokyo, Japan, eldest son of [400]Edward Henry
          Bickersteth; b. at Banningham (10 m. n, of Norwich), Norfolk,
          June 26, 1850; d. at Chisledon (30 m. n. of Salisbury),
          Wiltshire, Aug. 5, 1897. He was educated at Cambridge (B.A.,
          1873), and was ordained priest in 1874. He was curate at
          Hampstead, London, 1873-75; fellow of Pembroke College,
          Cambridge, from 1875 till 1877, when he headed the Cambridge
          Mission for Delhi, India. In this mission he so impaired his
          health that he was obliged to return to England in 1882, and he
          became rector of Framlingham, Suffolk. In 1886 he was
          consecrated bishop of Japan. He was an extreme High-churchman
          and strove to reproduce this type of church life among the
          Japanese. The result was the so-called "Catholic Church of
          Japan" (Nippon Sei Kokwai). In 1887 a visit to Korea bore fruit
          in the establishment of a mission in that country. In 1892 his
          visit to the Anglican mission stations in Japan convinced him
          that there should be more bishops; accordingly his diocese was
          made that of South Tokyo. Again his health gave way and he
          returned home to die. His lectures for Japanese divinity
          students were published under the title Our Heritage in the
          Church (London, 1898).

   Bidding Prayer
          BIDDING PRAYER: Originally bidding of prayers, signifying "the
          praying (offering) of prayers," one of the meanings of the verb
          "to bid" down to the Reformation being "to ask pressingly, to
          beg, to pray." As this meaning became obsolete the phrase was
          interpreted to mean "the ordering or directing of prayers";
          i.e., an authoritative direction to the people concerning what
          or whom they should pray for, such directions being not uncommon
          in England in the sixteenth century. Still later "bidding" was
          taken as an adjective and the phrase "bidding prayer" came to
          mean the prayer before the sermon, which the preacher introduced
          by directing the congregation to pray for the Church catholic,
          the sovereign and the royal family, different estates of men,
          etc. (Constitution and Canons of the Church of England, § 55). A
          collect is now usually substituted for it, as the sermon, except
          on rare occasions, is preceded by the common prayers, which
          include the petitions prescribed by the canon. When, however,
          these prayers are not said before the sermon (as at university
          sermons), and on occasions of more than usual solemnity, the
          "bidding prayer" is used.

   Biddle, John
          BIDDLE, JOHN: A founder of modern English Unitarianism; b. at
          Wotton-under-Edge (15 m. s. of Gloucester), where he was
          baptized Jan. 14, 1615; d. in a London jail Sept. 22, 1662. He
          was educated at Oxford, and appointed head master of the free
          school in the parish of St. Mary le Crypt, Gloucester, 1641.
          Study of the Scriptures led him to disbelieve the doctrine of
          the Trinity, and, his unsoundness being reported to the city
          magistrates, he was summoned before them. Fearing imprisonment,
          he made a confession of faith (May 2, 1644) which was not
          satisfactory, and so he made a second in which he used more
          conventional language and was allowed to go free. He then
          committed to paper Twelve Arguments Drawn out of Scripture:
          wherein the commonly received opinion touching the Deity of the
          Holy Spirit is clearly and fully refuted, and to these views he
          was faithful the rest of his life. A friend informed the
          magistrates of the existence of this paper and so he was cited
          before the committee of Parliament then at Gloucester, and put
          in the common jail Dec. 2, 1645. Happily a prominent citizen
          bailed him out. In 1646 he was summoned to appear before
          Parliament at Westminster to explain his position, and boldly
          avowed his belief. He was committed to the custody of one of the
          officers of the House of Commons and so continued for five
          years. Meanwhile a committee of the Assembly of Divines sitting
          at Westminster considered his case and to them he gave a copy of
          his Twelve Arguments. They made answer to it, but did not move
          him. So in 1647 he published his paper, which makes a tract of
          thirty-eight small pages. It stirred up great indignation and
          was suppressed and burned by the common hangman. Next he
          published A Confession of Faith Touching the Holy Trinity,
          according to the Scripture (1648), a tract of seventy-five small
          pages, in which in six articles, accompanied by expositions, he
          plainly states his views, making God the Father the first person
          of the Holy Trinity; one chief Son of the most high God, with
          only a human nature, though our God by reason of his divine
          sovereignty over us, yet subordinate to the most high God, the
          second person; and one principal minister of God and Christ the
          third. Next came another tract (eighty-six pages) containing
          alleged testimonies in favor of his views from the Fathers. In
          1648 Parliament, at the instigation of the Westminster divines,
          made denial of the Trinity a capital offense, yet Biddle was not
          only not put to death, but in 1649 was released on bail. He
          became a chaplain and preacher in Staffordshire, but was shortly
          recalled and remained in prison till Feb., 1651. On his release
          he publicly advocated his views and continued his publications
          with A Two-fold Catechism; the one simply called a Scripture
          Catechism; the other a brief Scripture Catechism for Children
          (1654, the first of 141 small pages, the second of thirty-four,
          both with a preface). The answers, being entirely in quoted
          Scripture, could not be gainsaid, but the questions were open to
          serious criticism. Consequently he was examined by the House of
          Commons and committed to prison on Dec. 3, 1854, and was not
          released till May 28, 1655. The Catechism was burned by the
          common hangman Dec. 14, 1654. Again publicly advocating his
          beliefs on July 3, 1655, he was thrown into prison and a little
          later was tried for his life on the ordinance above mentioned.
          Cromwell, unwilling to put him to death, banished him to the
          Scilly Islands (Oct. 5, 1655), and allowed him 100 crowns a year
          for maintenance. In 1658 he was released, and resumed preaching.
          In the latter part of Aug., 1662, he was again imprisoned and
          after five weeks died.

          Mönchenstein (3 m. s. of Basel) 1843; professor extraordinary at
          Zurich 1850, ordinary 1860, where he lectured at first upon
          theological encyclopedia and New Testament introduction, later
          chiefly upon dogmatic theology. He was the leading theologian of
          the neo-Hegelians, and was deeply influenced by the Tübingen
          school, especially by Strauss. He was a prolific writer for the
          religious press, but obtained his greatest repute by his
          Christliche Dogmatik (Zurich, 1869; 2d ed., Berlin, 1884-85,
          vol. ii edited by Rehmke), in which he denies the historicity of
          the Gospels, yet holds to the eternal ideas which the supposed
          facts of the Gospels embody; denies Christian doctrine, but
          advocates Christian practise; denies personality to God and
          personal immortality to man, yet holds that love to God and man
          constitutes the essence of religion. He took a deep interest in
          education and public affairs, preached often and by preference
          to small and weak congregations, and was tactful and courteous
          in his associations with men of all classes; he was a lover of
          athletics and a robust mountain-climber. Many of his briefer
          publications were collected under the title ausgewählte Vorträge
          und Aufsätze, with a biographical introduction by J. Kradolfer
          (Berlin, 1885).

   Biel, Gabriel
          BIEL, bîl, GABRIEL: One of the most remarkable theologians of
          the late Middle Ages; b. at Speyer; d. at Tübingen 1495. He
          studied at Heidelberg, became preacher at St. Martin's Church at
          Mainz, provost of Urach in Württemberg, and after 1484 professor
          of theology and philosophy in the newly founded University of
          Tübingen. In his old age he joined the Brethren of the Common
          Life (see [402]Common Life, Brethern of the). In theology Biel
          followed the nominalism of [403]Occam, whose system he
          reproduced in his Epitome et collectorium ex Occamo super
          quattuor libros sententiarum (Tübingen, 1495). In anthropology
          and soteriology he was a Semi-Pelagian, teaching that "merit
          depends on man's free will and God's grace" (sermo xiv, 7); the
          sacraments operate not only ex opere operantis, but also ex
          opere operato" (Sent., IV, i, 3). The Church, therefore, was for
          him a mechanically operating sacramental institution; in its
          priests he glorifies a "mighty dignity." In questions affecting
          the constitution of the Church, Biel took the position assumed
          by the councils of Constance and Basel. As a preacher he
          surpassed his predecessors in the practicality of his views; his
          knowledge of political economy also deserves recognition.
          Besides the work already noticed, he wrote Lectura super canonem
          missæ (Reutlingen, 1488); Expositio canonis missæ (Tübingen,
          1499); Sermones (1499); and other works.

   Bigne, Marguerin de la
          BIGNE, bîñ, MARGUERIN, m??r´´ge´´ran, DE LA: French theologian;
          b. at Bernières-le-Patry, in Normandy, 1546 or 1547; d. at Paris
          1589. He came of noble Norman parentage; studied at Caen and
          became rector of the university there; went to Paris, where he
          studied theology at the Sorbonne and received the doctorate. To
          refute the authors of the Magdeburg Centuries in June, 1576, he
          undertook to give a fuller edition of the writings of the
          Fathers of the Church than had been yet made. For this work he
          was appointed canon of the church of Bayeux, and some time after
          professor of the chapter-school; resigned to succeed his uncle,
          François du Parc, who had died, as dean of the church of Mans.
          In 1576 he was sent as deputy from the clergy of Normandy to the
          States General of Blois. In 1581 he went as canon of Bayeux to
          the provincial council there, and defended vigorously his
          chapter against the usurpation of Bernardin de St. François,
          bishop of Bayeux. The death of the bishop (July 14, 1582)
          appeared to end the conflict; but the bishop's successor,
          Mathurin de Savonnières, eventually forced Bigne to resign. He
          returned to Paris, where he died the same year. He was a great
          patristic scholar and an eloquent preacher.

   Billican, Theobald
          BILLICAN, THEOBALD (Diepold Gernolt or Gerlacher): German
          theologian; b. at Billigheim (4 m. s.s.w. of Landau), Bavaria,
          toward the end of the fifteenth century; d. at Marburg Aug. 8,
          1554. He took his surname from his birthplace; studied at
          Heidelberg, where Melanchthon was his fellow student; lectured
          at Heidelberg; became provost of the college of arts (1520) and
          had among others [404]Johann Brenz as his pupil. When, in 1518,
          Luther came to Heidelberg, Billican, Brenz, Schnepff, and
          [405]Martin Butzer were among his admirers. Billican left
          Heidelberg in 1522 and went to Weil as preacher. But his sermons
          against the mediatorship of the Virgin Mary and against
          purgatory brought about his deposition and he went to Nördlingen
          (1523), where he remained till 1535. Billican opened there a way
          for the Reformation and published Von der Mess Gemein Schlussred
          (1524), in which he sharply rebuked the "fraud" of the mass as a
          sacrifice for the living and the dead. Billican, who
          corresponded with Luther, Melanchthon, Rhegius, Brenz,
          OEcolampadius, and Zwingli, was regarded as a leader of the
          Evangelical cause in South Germany. But future events showed the
          instability of his character. In his controversy with Carlstadt,
          who had come to Nördlingen, he sided with Luther against
          Carlstadt in the doctrine of the Lord's Supper and stated in his
          Renovatio ecclesiæ (1525) that "in the Lord's Supper the flesh
          and blood of the Lord are present." Induced by [406]Urbanus
          Rhegius openly to defend the Lutheran doctrine, Billican sent a
          statement to Rhegius, which the latter published (in mutilated
          form, as Billican complained) together with his answer Dec. 18,
          1525, under the title De verbis coenæ dominicæ et opinionum
          varietate Theobaldi Billicani ad Urbanum Regium (1526). But
          while they of Wittenberg were rejoicing over this new ally,
          Billican changed his views in a letter addressed to
          OEcolampadius Jan. 16, 1526; and two months later, in letters
          addressed to Schleupner at Nuremberg and to Pirkheimer, he
          expressed still other views. While Billican did not fully agree
          with Zwingli, he stated that he learned more from the Zwinglians
          than from the Lutherans, and, adopting in part the views of
          Carlstadt and OEcolampadius, he pretended to teach the only
          correct doctrine because he stood between the two parties. His
          vacillating position is best illustrated in a booklet entitled
          Epistola Theobaldi Billicani ad Joannem Hubelium qua illo de
          eucharistia cogitandi materiam conscriptsit (1528) which
          remained unnoticed.

          Billican, of whom so much had been expected, was now avoided by
          both parties. In 1529 he applied to Heidelberg University for
          the doctorate, presenting at the same time a confession in which
          he acrimoniously rejected Lutheran, Zwinglian, and Anabaptist
          doctrine, and expressed his firm belief in the teachings of the
          Roman Catholic Church. Being refused by the faculty, he married
          a woman of wealth, and, regardless of what had taken place, he
          had the boldness to ask Melanchthon to procure him the doctorate
          at Wittenberg. The latter replied, "[The authorities] advance no
          one before he has set forth his doctrinal views" (CR, i, 1112).
          Since he was repelled by the Reformers and not fully trusted by
          the Roman Catholics, Billican's position became untenable, and
          so in 1535 he left Nördlingen and went to Heidelberg, where he
          commenced the study of jurisprudence. He was made licentiate in
          jurisprudence and for a time took the place of a professor who
          was disabled on account of sickness. When in 1543 that professor
          died and Billican sought the position, the entire faculty
          opposed his nomination, but through the influence of Margaret
          von der Layen, whose "chancellor" he was considered, he was
          permitted to give independent lectures on law. On account of his
          relations with Margaret, the elector Frederick II deposed
          Billican from his office July 26, 1544, and ordered him to leave
          Heidelberg. He went to Marburg and was made professor of
          rhetoric, a position which he held till his death.

          Norfolk family about 1495; burned at the stake at Norwich Aug.
          19, 1531. He studied at Trinity Hall, Cambridge, and gave up law
          for theology and was ordained priest in 1519. He adopted the
          belief in justification by faith alone and was a leader in a
          company of Cambridge men who were inclined to the views of the
          Reformation; Hugh Latimer was added to the number by Bilney's
          influence and became his lifelong friend. Concerning the mass,
          transubstantiation, and the powers of the pope and the Church,
          Bilney remained orthodox; but he preached unremittingly in
          Cambridge, London, and neighboring counties, denouncing the
          invocation of saints and relic-worship, pilgrimages and
          fastings, at the same time leading a most austere life and
          devoted to deeds of charity. He was arrested and confined in the
          Tower Nov. 25, 1527; brought to trial, he denied having
          wittingly taught the doctrines of Luther, but was finally
          persuaded to abjure his alleged heresies and as penance was kept
          imprisoned for more than a year. Released in 1529, he went back
          to Cambridge, suffered much from remorse for his abjuration, and
          in 1531 resumed preaching, but was immediately arrested, and was
          executed as a relapsed heretic.

          learning, and defended the Church of England against both Roman
          Catholics and Puritans. At the command of Queen Elizabeth he
          wrote The True Difference between Christian Subjection and
          Unchristian Rebellion (Oxford, 1585), in answer to Cardinal

          Leeds), Yorkshire, Sept., 1668; d. at Havant (6 m. s.e. of
          Portsmouth), Hampshire, Aug. 17, 1723. He studied at Oxford and
          was fellow of University College 1689-95, when he resigned and
          withdrew from the university because his controversial sermon on
          the Trinity preached before the university had led to the
          charge, wholly unmerited, of heresy. He was immediately
          appointed rector of HeadbournWorthy (2 m. n. of Winchester),
          which made the rich cathedral library accessible to him. In 1712
          he was transferred to the better living of Havant. His fame
          rests upon his Origines Ecclesiasticæ, or the Antiquities of the
          Christian Church (8 vols., London, 1708-22). This is exhaustive
          for the field it covers and can never be superseded, as it is
          derived from the sources and interestingly written. It has been
          a quarry for many books and itself several times reprinted; the
          best edition is by the great-great-grandson of the author, Rev.
          Richard Bingham (vols. i-viii of Bingham's Works, 10 vols.,
          Oxford, 1855). There is a separate edition of the Antiquities in
          the Bohn Library (2 vols.), a Latin translation by Johann
          Heinrich Grischow (Grischovius; 11 vols., Halle, 1724-38), and
          an abridged German translation by an anonymous Roman Catholic
          author (4 vols., Augsburg, 1788-96). Unfortunately Bingham
          invested his savings in the South Sea Bubble and so lost them in
          1720.

   Binney, Thomas
          BINNEY, THOMAS: English Congregationalist; b. at
          Newcastle-upon-Tyne Apr. 30, 1798; d. at Clapton, London, Feb.
          24, 1874. He was for seven years a bookseller's clerk at
          Newcastle, during which time he learned Greek and Latin and
          accomplished considerable reading. He studied at the theological
          seminary at Wymondley, Hertfordshire, and was minister for a
          year at Bedford; became minister at Newport, Isle of Wight,
          1824, of the King's Weigh-House Chapel, Eastcheap, London, 1829,
          and remained there forty years. After retiring from his
          pastorate he was professor of homiletics and pastoral theology
          at New College, London. He was chairman of the Congregational
          Union in 1848. He was strongly opposed to an established Church,
          and in 1833 at the laying of the cornerstone of a new chapel for
          the Weigh-House congregation expressed himself on the subject in
          language which led to a long and bitter controversy. He felt
          that the sermon occupied too large a place in the service of the
          non-ritualistic Churches and favored the introduction of
          responsive readings and similar changes in the form of worship;
          his Service of Song in the House of the Lord (London, 1848)
          exercised much influence in the development of a richer and
          better musical service, and he enriched the hymnals by the hymn
          "Eternal light, eternal light." He edited Charles W. Baird's
          Chapter on Liturgies, adding a preface and an appendix, "Are
          Dissenters to Have a Liturgy?" (1856). His other publications
          include a Memoir of Stephen Morell (1826); Dissent Not Schism
          (1835); a life of Sir Thomas Fowell Buxton (1849); Is it
          Possible to Make the Best of Both Worlds? (1853); Lights and
          Shadows, or Church Life in Australia, observations made during a
          visit in 1857-59 (1860); Money, a Popular Exposition in Rough
          Notes (1864); St. Paul, his Life and Ministry (1866); Micah the
          Priest Maker, a handbook on ritualism (1867); From Seventeen to
          Thirty, a book for young men (1868). Two series of his Sermons
          Preached in the King's Weigh-House Chapel, 1829-69, were
          published, the second with biographical sketch by the Rev. H.
          Allon (1869-75).

   Binterim, Anton Josef
          BINTERIM, ANTON JOSEF: German Catholic theologian; b. at
          Düsseldorf Sept. 19, 1779; d. at Bilk (n. suburb of Düsseldorf)
          May 17, 1855. After receiving his first education in his native
          city, he entered the Franciscan order in 1796 and studied
          philosophy and theology at Düren and Aachen for five years and a
          half. Returning to Düsseldorf, he was ordained priest at Cologne
          (Sept. 19, 1802). The suppression of the monasteries on the
          right bank of the Rhine in the following year, however, obliged
          him to become a secular priest, and in 1805, after passing the
          required examination, he was appointed to the ancient and
          extensive parish of Bilk, where he remained until his death.
          Binterim was an enthusiastic propagandist of ultramontanism, and
          to this cause he devoted the greater part of his prolific
          literary activity. He also defended the Jesuits and upheld the
          authenticity of the Holy Coat of Treves, while with equal
          consistency he opposed the followers of [408]Georg Hermes and
          Catholic "rationalism." In 1837, with his elder brother, he had
          founded and endowed the vicarage of St. Anthony of Padua at
          Bilk, and in honor of his jubilee the first impulse toward the
          establishment of the Historischer Verein für den Niederrhein was
          given in 1852. In his devotion to the Church he was imprisoned
          for six months in 1838 for opposing mixed marriages.

          priest in 1731, although of Quaker parentage and without a
          university education; was an ardent Whig and, having influential
          patrons, received many good preferments, holding at the time of
          his death the rectories of St. Margaret Pattens, London, and
          Depden, Suffolk. He was an indefatigable writer, and his works
          have been criticized as showing more industry than judgment;
          they include a number of volumes relating to English history;
          lives of Robert Boyle (London, 1744), Archbishop Tillotson
          (1752), and others, as well as most of the English biographies

          1908. He was educated at the University of Pennsylvania (B.A.,
          1857) and Union Theological Seminary (1860). He was ordained to
          the Lutheran ministry in 1860, and after serving as an
          army-chaplain in 1862-63, held several pastorates. In 1870 he
          became Protestant Episcopal rector of Spotswood, N. J., from
          1870 to 1874. Seven years later he was appointed professor of
          psychology, Christian ethics, and rhetoric in Lehigh University,
          remaining there in this capacity, as well as in that of
          chaplain, until 1886. He was also acting chaplain there in
          1896-98, and from 1893 to 1898 was editor of Lippincott's
          Magazine. In the latter year be became associate editor of
          Chandler's Encyclopedia. In addition to numerous contributions
          to periodicals and encyclopedias, including most of the American
          matter in Julian's Dictionary of Hymnology (London, 1892), he
          has edited Charles Wesley Seen in his Finer land Less Familiar
          Poems ( New York, 1867); the Hymns of the Lutheran Pennsylvania
          ministerium (Philadelphia, 1865; in collaboration with S. M.
          Schmucker); and Songs of the Spirit (New York, 1871; in
          collaboration with Bishop W. H. Odenheimer). He made a
          noteworthy collection of hymnology, now in Union Theological
          Seminary, New York City.

          [411]Polity; for views of different communions concerning the
          office, see [412]Episcopacy; this article will deal mainly with
          the selection of bishops and their duties.

  Election and Consecration.

          In the Roman Catholic Church the bishop holds the first place in
          the hierarchy, not as belonging to a separate order, but as
          having the fulness of the priesthood. Conditions for
          consecration are the following: legitimate birth, the age of
          thirty years, eminent learning, and moral probity. In the
          ordinary case the candidate is supposed also to be a native of
          the country and acceptable to the government. The choice of the
          person belongs, on the curialist theory, to the pope; but in
          practise it is generally left to the chapter, either by
          election, or when there are canonical impediments to be removed,
          as when translation from another see is required, by
          [413]Postulation; or it may occur through nomination by the
          government. The candidate must then receive the papal
          confirmation, after examination as to his fitness. This is made
          first by a papal delegate in the place of the election
          (processus informativus in partibus electi), after which a
          second investigation takes place at Rome, by the committee of
          cardinals appointed for the purpose (congregatio examinis
          episcoporum); this second examination is called processus
          electionis definitivus in curia. If both prove favorable to the
          candidate, he is confirmed, preconized, and put in possession of
          his powers of jurisdiction, though not, of course, of those
          pertaining to orders until his consecration, which is supposed
          to occur within three months. It is administered by a bishop
          designated by the pope, with the assistance of two other bishops
          or prelates, in the cathedral of the new bishop's diocese. The
          candidate takes the ancient oath of fidelity to the pope
          (substantially the same as that prescribed by Gregory VII in
          1079), signs the profession of faith, and then, after he has
          been duly consecrated according to the form laid down in the
          Roman Pontifical, is solemnly enthroned. An oath of allegiance
          to the government of the country is also usually administered
          before consecration.

  Rights and Duties.

          The rights or powers of a bishop may be considered under three
          heads--as pertaining to his orders, to his jurisdiction, and to
          his dignity. As to the first, he has all the jura ordinis of the
          fulness of the priesthood, including, besides those powers which
          every priest shares with him, the special episcopal prerogatives
          of administering ordination and confirmation, of consecrating
          the holy oils, churches, and sacred objects in general, of
          benediction of abbots and abbesses, and of anointing sovereigns.
          The rights of jurisdiction, in the broad sense, embrace the
          bishop's whole power of ruling his diocese as its chief pastor.
          Sometimes, however, the term lex jurisdictionis is applied
          specially to his legislative and executive functions (for the
          jurisdictio contentiosa and coercitiva--i.e., the power of
          hearing cases and pronouncing and enforcing judgment--see
          [414]Audientia Episcopalis; [415]Jurisdiction, Ecclesiastical),
          while the expression lex dioecesana refers to his right to the
          various church taxes. These rights belong to the bishop as
          bishop, and in regard to them he is judex ordinarius, "the
          ordinary"; but he often holds other powers specially delegated
          to him as representative of the pope (see [416]Faculties).
          Finally, in regard to his dignity, he takes ecclesiastical rank,
          in virtue of his exalted office, immediately after the
          cardinals, and bears various customary titles of honor, being
          addressed as " Right Reverend," "My Lord," etc. In many places
          he also enjoys secular precedence; and he has his special
          insignia and vestments (see [417]Vestments and Insignia,
          Ecclesiastical). To these prerogatives corresponding duties are
          attached, including not only the cure of souls, but residence in
          his diocese, and a visit to Rome to report upon its condition at
          fixed intervals, varying with the distance. Since the bishop is
          naturally unable to exercise all the rights and duties above
          described in person throughout his entire diocese, he has always
          had special assistants--in early times the archdeacons and
          archpriests, later his chapter and variously designated
          functionaries, vicars-general and the like, as well as, for
          those things which pertain to the power of orders, coadjutor or
          assistant bishops. See the articles under these titles.

          In the Protestant Churches the episcopate in the Roman Catholic
          sense has not been preserved. In the early days of the
          Reformation in Germany, the assaults of the Reformers were
          directed not so much against the episcopal power in itself as
          against abuses in its exercise; until 1545 the question was
          debated on what conditions the adherents of the evangelical
          doctrine could agree to submit to the existing bishops of the
          old Church. The Lutheran confessions of faith recognize as of
          divine right only the pastoral function in the bishop's office;
          all else is of merely human institution, and may be abolished by
          the same power that created it. Since, however, they laid down
          no definite form of ecclesiastical polity as ordained by God,
          they could and did declare themselves willing to recognize these
          powers still, so long as the bishops would allow freedom to
          teach the pure doctrine and tolerate the priests who preached
          it. Some bishops fulfilled the condition and accepted the
          evangelical doctrine; but this semblance of episcopal government
          had clearly nothing in common with the pre-Reformation
          episcopate except the name and certain forms. Elsewhere, as in
          Schwerin and later at Osnabrück and Lübeck, the name bishop was
          definitely used for an official appointed by the ruling power,
          in no sense ecclesiastical. The attempt to prove that the German
          Reformation deliberately intended to retain episcopal government
          is quite useless, though the tendency which it represents has
          had adherents, among whom were Frederick William IV and Bunsen.
          Where the title has been employed in the modern evangelical
          Church of Germany, it represents nothing more than a general
          superintendent. The bishops of England, Sweden, and Denmark are
          also not bishops in the strict sense understood by the Roman
          Catholics; their institutions rest on special historical grounds
          which are beyond the scope of this article.

          (E. Friedberg.)

          In the Church of England there are three classes of bishops: the
          diocesan bishops, taking their titles (with a few exceptions of
          recently founded sees) from the old pre-Reformation dioceses;
          suffragan bishops, bearing likewise territorial titles; and
          assistant bishops. The diocesan bishops are nominally elected by
          the chapters of their cathedrals, but practically are appointed
          by the Crown, which sends a nomination to the chapter with the
          congé d'élire. Suffragan bishops are also nominated by the
          Crown, while assistant bishops are appointed by the prelate
          under whom they are to serve. Their appointment is revocable at
          his pleasure; that of suffragans is for life. None of these
          classes has any jurisdiction independent of its superior. With
          the first extension of the Anglican colonial episcopate, the
          English government attempted to claim the same right of
          nomination as at home; but this claim was abandoned, and the
          colonial bishops are now elected either by the clergy or by the
          deliberative assemblies of their dioceses. In the Episcopal
          Church of the United States, bishops are elected by the diocesan
          conventions: their election must then be confirmed by a majority
          of the other bishops and "standing committees." Assistant
          bishops in this Church are now known as bishops-coadjutor, and
          have the right of succession on the death of the diocesan
          bishop. In England bishops are frequently "translated" from one
          see to another; in the United States, bishops of missionary
          jurisdictions may be elected to a diocesan see, but this is all.
          Throughout the Anglican communion consecration by three other
          bishops is required. Every English bishop at his consecration
          takes the oaths of allegiance to the sovereign and canonical
          obedience to his metropolitan; in the United States each bishop
          is independent, subject only to the general law of the Church as
          formulated by the General Convention, the office of presiding
          bishop being almost purely honorary. Throughout the Anglican
          communion the administration of certain quasisacramental rites
          (confirmation, ordination, consecration of churches, etc.) is
          strictly reserved to the bishop, who also has a power of
          ordinary jurisdiction in some measure resembling that exercised
          by the Roman Catholic prelates. The two English archbishops, the
          bishops of London, Winchester, and Durham, and most of the other
          bishops (the number corresponding to that of the more ancient
          sees), as "spiritual lords," have seats in the upper house of
          parliament. The American Methodist Episcopal Church also has its
          bishops, who are elected in any number required by the General
          Conference. They have joint jurisdiction throughout the Church,
          being confined to no diocese or districts, though for practical
          reasons the General Conference designates episcopal residences
          at its quadrennial sessions. Their functions are purely
          executive--they preside at conferences, arrange districts for
          presiding elders, fix appointments of preachers, and,
          especially, travel throughout the Church to promote its
          spiritual and temporal interests. No distinction of order is
          recognized between them and other ministers.

          Vernon, Oneida County, N. Y., Aug. 12, 1808; d. at Saratoga Aug.
          7, 1880. He was graduated at Brown 1837, and elected tutor; was
          superintendent of schools in Providence 1838-51, in Boston
          1851-57. Removing to New York, he became an active member of the

   Bishop, Titular
          BISHOP, TITULAR: According to the old law of the Church, only
          one bishop was consecrated for a diocese; and none was
          consecrated at large or without a definite diocese (First
          Council of Nicæa, canon viii). If, therefore, occasion arose for
          the designation of a representative to perform episcopal
          functions in the place of an incapacitated bishop, it was
          necessary to call upon some neighboring bishop or one who
          happened to be in those parts (see [420]Coadjutor). In the ninth
          and tenth centuries, certain Spanish bishops who had been driven
          from their sees by the Saracens, and in the tenth some from
          Prussia and Livonia who were in a similar position, served in
          this capacity. The same service was rendered in the fourteenth
          century by the bishops of sees founded in the East during the
          crusades and afterward occupied by the Mohammedans. So, even
          after all hope of the recovery of these territories had been
          abandoned, bishops continued to be consecrated for these
          dioceses, called episcopi in partibus infidelium ("bishops in
          the regions of the unbelieving") until 1882, when Leo XIII
          ordered the use of the designation episcopi titulares. Their
          functions are various. In the first place, they serve as
          auxiliary or coadjutor bishops in dioceses where the need
          exists, when the diocesan makes a request to the pope for such
          an assignment, naming a suitable person, and giving assurance
          for his support. The coadjutor of course possesses all the jura
          ordinis like any other bishop, but exercises them only at the
          direction of his superior, and he has not, ex officio, the other
          prerogatives of a diocesan bishop (see [421]Bishop). Apostolic
          vicars, who administer missionary districts not formed into
          dioceses are usually consecrated bishops, and so are certain
          Roman functionaries who are members of the great congregations,
          and papal nuncios and other diplomatic representatives. Titular
          bishops are also consecrated for certain special purposes, such
          as the administration of holy orders to the Uniat Greeks of
          Italy, and the spiritual oversight of the military and naval
          forces of certain countries (see [422]Exemption).

   Bishopric, or Diocese
          BISHOPRIC, or DIOCESE: The territory over which the jurisdiction
          of a bishop extends. The origin of such divisions goes back to
          the foundation and growth of the very early Christian
          communities. When the apostles founded a church in a city, the
          faithful living there (Gk. paroikoi, parepidemoi; cf. Eph. ii,
          19; I Pet. ii, 11) formed a community (paroikia) which gradually
          took more definite shape under the leadership of the presbyters
          or bishops, and gained adherents outside the town. At first
          these latter attended divine service in the city, until their
          numbers increased sufficiently to form a separate dependent
          community, the term paroikia being applied to the larger
          territory equally. In the West the name parochia retained this
          sense until the ninth century, when it became restricted to
          single parishes in the modern sense, the bishop's jurisdiction
          being known as dioecesis (already in use to designate a civil
          governor's jurisdiction). The latter word in the East, following
          the analogy of civil divisions, was applied to the district
          ruled by a patriarch. In Gaul the ecclesiastical unit was
          constituted out of the chief town of a district and its annexed
          territory (conventus, Gk. dioikesis), which in the Frankish
          period corresponded to the jurisdiction of a count. In Germany
          the original diocese was larger, and the Gau was coterminous
          with its subdivision of archdeaconry or deanery. The erection or
          redistribution of dioceses was from the fourth century a
          function of the metropolitan and the provincial synod; in
          Germany from the eighth century it was carried out under papal
          supervision. From the eleventh century it has been reserved to
          the pope; but in Germany the joint action of the state has been
          required, the matter being considered a causa mixta.

   Bishops' Book, The
          BISHOPS' BOOK, THE: A work published at London in 1537, compiled
          by a commission of English bishops and clergymen, of which the
          full title is The Institution of a Christian Man, containing the
          exposition or interpretation of the common creed, of the seven
          sacraments, of the x commandments and of the pater noster, and
          of the ave maria, justification, and purgatory. It reflects the
          conditions of the time in maintaining that the authority of the
          pope is a human institution, while not denying that the Church
          of Rome is a part of the Church Universal. It is reprinted in
          Formularies of Faith Put Forth by Authority during the Reign of
          Henry VIII, edited by C. Lloyd, bishop of Oxford (Oxford, 1825).

   Black Rubric
          BLACK RUBRIC: The popular name for the declaration enjoining
          kneeling at the end of the order for the administration of the
          Lord's Supper in the prayer-book of the Church of England, so
          called because it was printed in black letter in the prayer-book
          as revised by [427]William Sancroft in 1661. It is not, strictly
          speaking, a rubric at all as it is intended for the direction of
          the people and not for the officiating clergy. Nor did Sancroft
          originate it, as it dates back to the second prayer-book of
          Edward VI (1552), whose council ordered that the communicants
          should receive the elements kneeling, and explained in the
          "rubric" that this attitude was not used to express belief in
          transubstantiation. The "rubric" was omitted in the Elizabethan
          prayer-book of 1559, and this omission was one of the cherished
          grievances of the Puritans. In the Savoy Conference of 1661 the
          Presbyterians demanded its restoration, but the bishops were not
          at the time inclined to grant it; at the last moment, however,
          it was replaced and so it appears in the revised prayer-book of
          Charles II and is still retained in the English prayer-book. It
          was removed from the prayer-book as revised for the American
          Episcopal Church in 1789.

          BLAIR, HUGH: Church of Scotland; b. in Edinburgh Apr. 7, 1718;
          d. there Dec. 27, 1800. He studied in the local university;
          became minister of Colessie, Fifeshire, 1742; second minister of
          the Canongate Church, Edinburgh, 1743; minister of Lady Yester's
          1754; was transferred to the High Church 1758. From 1759 he
          lectured in the University so acceptably on rhetoric and
          belles-lettres, that in 1760 he was appointed the town council
          professor in that department, and from 1762 to 1783 was the
          royal professor; when on resigning he published his lectures (2
          vols.) he became one of the most famous authors of works on
          rhetoric in the English language and retained the position for a
          century. In 1780 he received a pension of £200 a year. To his
          own generation he was a most acceptable preacher and his sermons
          continued to be read and to be translated far into the
          nineteenth century. Their simplicity, excellent style, and high
          morality account for their vogue, but their lack of depth in
          thought and spirituality have caused them to lose popularity.

          graduated M.A. at Edinburgh in 1673; became a clergyman of the
          Episcopal Church of Scotland and was rector of Cranston in the
          diocese of Edinburgh. In the latter part of the reign of Charles
          II he went to England and was persuaded by Dr. Compton, bishop
          of London, to emigrate to Virginia, where he arrived in 1685; he
          was minister of Henrico parish till 1694, at Jamestown till
          1710, and at Williamsburg the rest of his life. In 1689 he was
          appointed by the bishop of London commissar, for Virginia, the
          highest church office in the colony, the duties of which were
          practically those of a bishop exclusive of ordination. After
          1793 he was member of the colonial Council and for many years
          its president. He was a man of sterling character and great
          ability, and worked with persistent zeal and energy to promote
          the religious and material welfare of Virginia. He did much to
          elevate the character of the colonial clergy. With several of
          the governors he had bitter disputes and was influential in
          securing their removal. He was founder and first president of
          William and Mary College, for which he procured a charter in
          England in 1693, and which he made a success in spite of great
          difficulties and discouragements. He published four volumes
          containing 117 sermons on Our Savior's Divine Sermon on the
          Mount (London, 1722) and with Henry Hartwell and Edward Chilton
          prepared The Present State of Virginia and the College (London,
          1727).

          America; studied at Tennent's "Log College" at Neshaminy; was
          ordained pastor of Middletown and Shrewsbury, N. J., 1734; in
          1739 removed to Londonderry or Fagg's Manor (40 m. w.s.w. of
          Philadelphia), Chester County, Penn., and established there a
          school after the model of the "Log College." He was an adherent
          of Gilbert Tennent in the controversies of his time. His
          principal writings were collected by his brother, Rev. John
          Blair (Philadelphia, 1754); they include sermons, a treatise on
          predestination and reprobation, and an account of a revival in
          his congregation at Londonderry.

          m. s.w. of St. Andrews), Fifeshire, Jan. 13, 1830. He studied at
          the University of St. Andrews (M.A., 1850), and in 1856 was
          ordained to the United Presbyterian ministry at Dunblane,
          Perthshire. He was clerk to the Stirling Presbytery for
          twenty-five years, and to the United Presbyterian Synod
          1894-1900; since 1900 he has been clerk to the United Free
          Church General Assembly, and was moderator of the United
          Presbyterian Synod in 1898-99. He has been chaplain to the
          famous Black Watch since 1892, a member of the University Court
          of St. Andrews University since 1903. In theology he adheres
          strictly to the Westminster Confession. He has written
          Chronicles of Aberbrothoc (Arbroath, 1853); Rambling
          Recollections: or, Scenes worth Seeing (Edinburgh, 1857);

          BLAKESLEE, ERASTUS: Congregationalist; b. at Plymouth, Conn.,
          Sept. 2, 1838; d. at Brookline, Mass., July 12, 1908. While a
          sophomore at Yale in 1861 he enlisted as a cavalryman. He was
          mustered out in 1865 as brevet brigadier-general of volunteers.
          After a business career he studied in Andover Theological
          Seminary from 1876 to 1879, and entered the Congregational
          ministry. He had three charges, at Greenfield, Mass., Fairhaven,
          Conn., and at Spencer, Mass. (1887-92), and resigned the last
          that he might give his whole time to the preparation and
          publication of the "Bible Study Union Lessons," which are not
          only widely used in this country, but translated into several
          missionary languages. With the teachers' aids, issued
          separately, more than 160 volumes of lessons were published.

          BLANCKMEISTER, FRANZ THEODOR: German Lutheran; b. at Plauen (21
          m. s.w. of Zwickau) Feb. 4, 1858. After studying at Leipsic from
          1877 to 1880 and teaching for a year, he entered the ministry,
          and has been, since 1897, pastor of Trinity Church in Dresden.
          In theology he is extremely Protestant and an adverse critic of
          the Roman Catholic Church. Of his numerous publications may be
          mentioned Alte Geschichte aus dem Sachsenlande (3 vols., Barmen,
          1886-89); Sachsenspiegel (Dresden, 1897; 2d ed., 1902); and

   Blandina, Saint
          BLANDINA, SAINT: A martyr who was among the victims of the
          persecution in Lyons under Marcus Aurelius. In the account of
          that persecution given by the Christian community there, and
          preserved by Eusebius (Hist. eccl., v, 1), the courage of the
          young slave girl is specially extolled; and she is singled out
          for mention by name, an honor which she shares with only seven
          of the other martyrs, including the bishop Pothinus.

   Blandrata, Georgius
          BLANDRATA, GEORGIUS: Italian Unitarian; b. about 1515 at Saluzzo
          (17 miles n.w. of Coni), Piedmont; d. after 1585. He migrated to
          Poland, where he became physician to Sigismund I, then went to
          Transylvania and served the widow of Jan Zapolya in a like
          capacity. Having returned to Italy, he went to Pavia, and became
          an object of suspicion on account of his radical utterances on
          theology, but escaped the Inquisition by going to Geneva. There
          he debated with Martinenghi, the preacher of the Italian
          congregation, also with Calvin, especially concerning the
          doctrine of the Trinity, which he regarded as endangering the
          doctrine of the unity of God. He regarded speculation on the
          relation of the three persons as unnecessary (F. Trechsel,
          Protestantische Antitrinitarier, 4 parts, Bern, 1841-42, ii,
          467; CR, xvii, 2871). Calvin replied in his Responsum ad
          quæstiones G. Blandratæ (Geneva, 1559). As some members of the
          congregation sided with Blandrata, Calvin had a confession
          signed which condemned the antitrinitarian doctrine. Blandrata
          went to Zurich, then again to Poland, where he was received by
          Prince Radziwill and took part in several synods (cf. H. Dalton,
          Lasciana, Berlin, 1898, iv), but Calvin's repeated warnings
          against him, stigmatizing him as "a foul pest," prevented any
          lasting activity. In 1563 Blandrata went again to Transylvania
          and openly professed Unitarianism, being assisted by Prince
          Stephen Bathori, afterward king of Poland. Faustus Socinus
          accused Blandrata of having separated from his coreligionists
          out of avarice; at any rate, tired of the conflict, he ceased to
          take part in public affairs.

   Blasphemy
          BLASPHEMY (Gk. blasphemia, "a speech or word of evil omen "):
          Properly any species of calumny and detraction, but technically
          limited to evil-speaking of God or things held sacred. The
          conception that such an act is a crime may be traced back to
          Judaism, whose code imposed death by stoning as a punishment
          (Lev. xxiv, 15-16; Matt. xxvi, 65; John x, 33). The later Roman
          law also attached the death penalty (Nov. Justin., LXXVII, i,
          1-2). In the earlier church law, blasphemy is not mentioned as a
          punishable offense. Pope Gregory IX (1227-41) prescribed penance
          for public blasphemy against God, the saints, or the Virgin; the
          guilty person must stand for seven Sundays at the church porch
          during the mass, on the last of the seven without cloak or
          shoes; he must fast the Fridays preceding on bread and water,
          and give alms according to his means. The civil authorities were
          also admonished to impose a fine. By the end of the century the
          offense came to be more definitely defined as any depreciatory
          or opprobrious expression concerning God, Christ, or the Holy
          Spirit, such as the denial of a divine attribute, or the
          ascription of something unseemly (as falsehood or revenge), or
          wishing ill to or in any way dishonoring God, the saints, or the
          Virgin. Leo X (1513-21) imposed fines according to the ability
          of the offender and bodily punishments which included flogging,
          boring the tongue, and condemnation to the galleys in extreme
          cases. Later a tendency to substitute admonition and exhortation
          for severe penalties becomes apparent. By the common law of
          England, and in many of the United States by statute law,
          blasphemy is an indictable offense; prosecutions, however, have
          become infrequent.

          (P. Hinschius.)

          The blasphemy against the Holy Ghost which is pronounced
          unpardonable (Matt. xii, 31; Mark iii, 29; Luke xii, 10) is best
          understood to be wilful and persistent resistance to the
          influences and warnings of God, which renders the subject in
          capable of repentance and pardon. See [429]Holy Spirit, II.

          b. at Osnabrück (30 m. n.e. of Münster) Jan. 22, 1843; d. at
          Halle Mar. 5, 1907. He studied in Göttingen (1860-61) and Bonn
          (1861-63; Ph.D., 1863), and after being a teacher in gymnasia at
          Bielefeld (1864-66), Naumburg-an-der-Saale (1866-70), Magdeburg
          (1870-73), and Stettin (1873-74), became privat-docent at
          Königsberg in 1874. Two years later he was appointed associate
          professor at Kiel, where he was promoted to the rank of full
          professor in 1881. From 1892 he was professor of classical
          philology at Halle. Besides editions of Greek authors and
          inscriptions, and several works on strictly classical themes, he
          published Philology of the Gospels (London, 1898) and Grammatik
          des neutestamentlichen Griechisch (Göttingen,1896; Eng. transl.
          by H. St. J. Thackeray, London, 1898), and edited Acta
          Apostolorum (Göttingen,1895; minor edition, Leipsic, 1896);
          Evangelium secundum Lucam (Leipsic, 1897); Evangelium secundum

   Blastares, Matthæus
          BLASTARES, MATTHÆUS: At first a secular priest and later a monk
          of the order of St. Basil, who made about 1335 a collection of
          laws, both civil and ecclesiastical, known as "Alphabetical
          Collection," Syntagma alphabeticum rerum omnium quæ in sacris
          canonibus comprehenduntur. The civil part ("political laws") is
          based upon the Novelæ of Justinian, the ecclesiastical
          ("canons") upon the collection of Photius, with the commentaries
          of Zonaras and Balsamon. Such a dictionary of law filled a
          practical want, and so was universally used by the Eastern
          clergy, and even translated into Slavic. A complete reprint is
          found in Beveridge's Synodicon, ii, 2, and in vol. vi of the
          Syntagma tOn theiOn kai hierOn kanonOn (Athens, 1859).

   Blaurer (Blarer, Blaarer), Ambrosius
          BLAURER (BLARER, BLAARER), AMBROSIUS: German Reformer; b. at
          Constance Apr. 12, 1492; d. at Winterthur (12 miles n.e. of
          Zurich), Switzerland, Dec. 6, 1564. He studied at Tübingen,
          where he became acquainted with Melanchthon; about 1510 he
          entered the monastery at Alpirsbach, and continued his studies
          at Tübingen till 1513. Through study of the Bible and of
          Luther's writings, to the reading of which he was led by his
          brother Thomas, who while studying at Wittenberg had become
          intimate with Luther and Melanchthon, he embraced the principles
          of the Reformation, which he tried to introduce into the
          monastery. Being opposed by the abbot, he went to Constance July
          5, 1522, and at the instance of the council of the city began to
          preach in 1525. He became the leader of the Reformation there.
          From 1528, Blaurer labored for the Reformation outside of his
          native city. He was present at the colloquy in Bern (Jan. 6,
          1528), was at Memmingen Nov., 1528-Feb., 1529, and presided over
          the convention of the friends of the Reformation in Upper
          Germany which met in Memmingen Feb. 27-Mar. 1, 1531. From May to
          July, 1531, he was at Ulm with OEcolampadius and Butzer,
          afterward at Geislingen, and (Sept. 1531-July, 1532) at
          Esslingen. He everywhere displayed ability in organization. In
          July, 1532, his native city recalled him, and in 1533 he married
          a former nun.

          In 1534 he was called by Duke Ulrich, together with the Lutheran
          Erhard Schnepf, to further the cause of the Reformation in the
          duchy of Württemberg. The two men came to an agreement, Aug. 2,
          1534, concerning the doctrine of the Lord's Supper paving
          thereby the way for the coming union of the German Evangelical
          Church. To Blaurer was assigned the south of Württemberg with
          residence at Tübingen. He encountered there certain
          difficulties: (1) the agreement with Schwenckfeld, 1535; (2) the
          reformation at the University of Tübingen, which Brenz had
          undertaken; (3) the image-question, which Blaurer solved by
          removing all of them from the churches, but the "idol-diet" at
          Urach left the decision to the duke. At Schmalkald Blaurer
          refused in Feb., 1537, to sign the articles of Luther, but
          approved those of Melanchthon. Court intrigues brought about
          Blaurer's dismissal in June, 1538. Not till 1556 did Duke
          Christopher compensate him for his four years' services. He was
          at Augsburg June 27-Dec. 6, 1539, where he earnestly labored
          against the luxury of the rich, pleaded for benevolence to the
          poor, and for the cause of morality. He went to Kempten and
          labored there (Dec., 1539, to the end of Jan., 1540) for the
          peace of the Church, and also at Isny, 1544-55.

          By the Interim, Constance lost its independence. The Spaniards
          took the city Aug. 6, 1548, and made it an Austrian town,
          speedily crushing the Reformation. Blaurer left there Aug. 28,
          and preached in Biel (1551-59), Leutmerken, and finally at
          Winterthur, where he died. He declined calls to Bern, Augsburg,
          Memmingen, and the Palatinate, and influenced large circles by
          his correspondence. His twenty-two hymns give evidence of
          poetical power and fervor.

          the most intelligent and deeply religious women of the
          Reformation time; d. in Constance 1542. She became deeply
          interested in the person and work of [431]Pilgram Marbeck during
          his residence in Strasburg (1528-1532) and, whether she
          sympathized with his antipedobaptist teaching or not, reproached
          Butzer for his intolerant proceedings against Marbeck and
          refused to be convinced by Butzer's arguments that Marbeck was a
          heretic or a hypocrite. She died while ministering to the
          plague-stricken poor of Constance, and has the honor of being
          one of the first Protestant women to engage in diaconal service.

          (250 m. n.e. of Odessa), Russia, July 31 (O. S.), 1831; d. in
          London May 8, 1891. Supposed to have been the child of a Russian
          officer named Peter Hahn, she married, at the age of seventeen,
          a Russian official, Nicephore Blavatsky, from whom she separated
          after a very few months. For the next twenty years her life was
          a wandering one, mixed with spiritualism and similar cults.
          During this time she visited Paris, Cairo, New Orleans, Tokyo,
          and Calcutta, and she claimed to have resided for seven years in
          Tibet, whence she pretended to draw the mysteries of
          [432]theosophy. In 1858 she started a spiritualistic movement in
          Russia, and in 1873 was again in the United States. In 1875 she
          founded at New York, in collaboration with Col. Henry Steel
          Olcott, the Theosophical Society. Her chief works, which have
          run through repeated editions and have been translated into many
          languages, both in Europe and India, are Isis Unveiled: The
          Master Key to Ancient and Modern Mysteries, the standard
          text-book of the Theosophists (2 vols., New York, 1877); Secret
          Doctrine: The Synthesis of Science, Religion, and Philosophy (2
          vols., 1888); Voice of the Silence (1889); Key to Theosophy, in
          the Form of Question and Answer (1889); and the posthumous From
          the Caves and Jungles of Hindostan (1892; originally contributed
          to the Russian Russky Vyestnik); Nightmare Tales (London, 1892)

          Bible to secure typographical accuracy and added to the marginal
          references; the edition appeared in 1769 and is the standard for
          the Oxford press. He also published A Dissertation by Way of
          Inquiry into the True Import and Application of the Vision
          Called Daniel's Prophecy of Seventy Weeks (Oxford, 1775); two
          sermons, on The Sign Given to Ahaz (1786) and Christ the Greater
          Glory of the Temple (1788); translations of Jeremiah and
          Lamentations (1784) and Zechariah (1797); and an edition of the
          Samaritan Pentateuch (1790).

   Bledsoe, Albert Taylor
          BLEDSOE, ALBERT TAYLOR: American Southern Methodist; b. at
          Frankfort, Ky., Nov. 9, 1809; d. at Alexandria, Va., Dec. 8,
          1877. He was graduated at West Point, 1830, became lieutenant of
          infantry, and resigned 1832; he became assistant professor of
          mathematics at Kenyan College, Gambier, O., 1834; entered the
          ministry of the Protestant Episcopal Church, was rector at
          Hamilton, O., and professor of mathematics at Miami University,
          Oxford, O., 1835-36; practised law in Springfield, Ill., and in
          the United States Supreme Court at Washington, 1840-48; was
          professor of mathematics in the University of Mississippi,
          1848-54, and in the University of Virginia, 1854-1861; he
          entered the Confederate service as a colonel, but was soon made
          assistant secretary of war; lived in England 1863-68; after 1867
          published The Southern Review at Baltimore, which under his
          management became one of the leading periodicals of the
          Methodist Church, South. He was ordained a Methodist minister in
          1871, but never took charge of a church. He was a strenuous
          advocate of the doctrine of free will and a stern opponent of
          atheism and skepticism; the doctrine of predestination he
          considered a reflection upon the divine glory, and a cause of
          unbelief; his views are set forth in his Examination of Edwards
          on the Will (Philadelphia, 1845) and his Theodicy, or
          Vindication of the Divine Glory (New York, 1853). He also
          published Liberty and Slavery (Philadelphia, 1857); The
          Philosophy of Mathematics (1868); Is Davis a Traitor? or was
          secession a constitutional right previous to the war of 1861?
          (Baltimore, 1866).

   Bleek, Friedrich
          BLEEK, FRIEDRICH: Protestant theologian and exegete; b. at
          Ahrensbök, Holstein, July 4, 1793; d. at Bonn Feb. 27, 1859. He
          studied theology and philology at Kiel and Berlin, 1812-17, and
          began to lecture as repetent in theology in the latter place in
          1818. His lectures on the Old and the New Testaments attracted
          attention, and in 1821 he was made extraordinary professor; he
          succeeded Lücke as professor at Bonn, 1829, receiving the same
          year his doctorate from Breslau. For thirty years Bleek lectured
          at the university in Bonn. He was extremely painstaking in the
          preparation of his lectures, which were so carefully written
          that after his death they could easily be used for publication,
          and continue in much larger circles the influence they had
          already exerted. His works printed during his lifetime include:
          Ueber die Entstehung und Zusammensetzung der Sibyllinischen
          Orakel, Ueber Verfasser und Zweck des Buches Daniel, and Beitrag
          zur Kritik und Deutung der Offenbarung Johannis, three valuable
          essays published in the theological review edited by
          Schleiermacher, De Wette, and Lücke (Berlin, 1819-22); Versuch
          einer vollständigen Einleitung in den Brief an die Hebräer
          (Berlin, 1828), followed in 1836 and 1840 by a translation of
          Hebrews and commentary on the book; Beiträge zur
          Evangelienkritik (Berlin, 1846). Of his posthumous works mention
          may be made of Einleitung in das Alte Testament (edited by his
          son J. F. Bleek and A. Kamphausen, Berlin, 1860; 3d ed., by
          Kamphausen, 1870; 4th, 5th, and 6th ed., by J. Wellhausen, 1878,

          distinguished for thoroughness in investigation and clearness of
          expression. His standpoint in criticism was conservative.

          1197; d. (near Ephesus?) 1272. He founded a monastery near
          Ephesus, and became its archimandrite. His many writings were
          philosophical treatises, discourses on the procession of the
          Holy Spirit, on the Trinity, on Christology, on the duties of
          the king, and an exposition of the Psalms. [He is principally
          noted for his defense of the Roman doctrine of the procession of
          the Spirit from Father and Son before the emperor John III
          Vatatzes at Nicæa.] Blemmydes was honest and incorruptible, but
          harsh in character. Out of devotion to the ascetic life, he
          declined the patriarchate.

   Blessedness

  BLESSEDNESS.

          Biblical Basis (§ 1).

          Foundation in Ethics (§ 2).

          In Communion with God (§ 3).

          Degrees of Blessedness (§ 4).

    1. Biblical Basis.

          The term "blessedness" is the usual rendering in the English
          Bible for the idea of the Hebrew asher and Greek makarios. The
          German Seligkeit represents besides the content of those words
          also the idea of the Greek sOzein, "to save." The Latin
          equivalent of makarios is beatus, which has, however, passed in
          usage to designate the state of Christians who have fallen
          asleep (cf. Rev. xiv, 13); while beatitudo in scholastic usage
          designates the aim and the highest good of the Christian. The
          union of two Biblical conceptions in one expression gives to the
          latter its unique Christian content, as is realized when the two
          ideas are traced to their junction. Illuminative of this point
          is Paul's use (Rom. iv, 7-8) of Ps. xxxii, 1-2. The Old
          Testament passage bases "blessedness" on forgiveness of sin, and
          goes to the root of human felicity or its opposite. The Reformed
          theology traced the idea of blessedness to the salvation implied
          in that forgiveness, and the fact is evinced in Luther's use of
          Seligkeit to express the state consequent upon forgiveness. Thus
          the union of the ideas of blessedness and salvation is manifest.

          The term suggests also the idea of a condition of abiding
          satisfaction fully realized in consciousness. This is attributed
          to God in I Tim. vi, 15-16 (cf. i, 11), with which dogmatics
          agrees on the ground of his absoluteness and completeness. In
          this respect, to man may be attributed only a relative
          blessedness. By reason of his constitution man may pursue and
          attain a sort of arbitrary satisfaction; and in consequence of
          his being a creature he can attain full satisfaction only in a
          way in accord with his inner nature. A purpose which for him
          reaches beyond the present life involves a blessedness not to be
          reached here, where only a conditioned form is for him
          attainable. This is the point of view of the Biblical
          presentation. Man holds, on the one hand, relations with God,
          and on this depends his blessedness; he is also, as a member of
          the race of Adam, a sinner and so under the impress of evil, and
          his blessedness is contingent upon salvation from this
          condition.

    2. Foundation in Ethics.

          On the foregoing basis is built Christian usage, in which
          "eternal life," "eternal blessedness," and "blessed eternity"
          are variant expressions for the same concept. Life in its
          fulness is the idea. The Bible and philosophy agree in the
          ethical as the source of blessedness (Jas. i, 25; Acts xx, 35),
          but the former annexes also a religious relationship (Jas. i,
          27). If the most significant limitation in life, that which
          distinguishes man from God, viz., guilt, be removed, on this
          line of thought blessedness may be attributed to man. Out of
          this comes the emphasis constantly laid in the language of the
          Gospels upon the identity of salvation and blessedness, the
          latter resting upon freedom from guilt and from the proscription
          arising from sin. Thus blessedness and life, in this way
          reaching its fulness, are regarded as equivalents.

    3. In Communion with God.

          A special dogmatic terminology has developed from this usage, as
          when Schleiermacher (Christliche Glaube, Berlin, 1821, §§ 100,
          101, 108, 110) describes the activity of Christ in that he
          receives believers up into his own God-consciousness and into
          participation in his serene blessedness, into the "peace" of the
          New Testament. Similarly J. C. K. von Hofmann (Theologische
          Ethik, Nördlingen, 1878, p. 89) asserts that "faith as obedience
          is freedom, faith as certainty is blessedness." So the term
          designates the religious side of the Christian's condition as
          distinct from the ethical. The eudemonistic side is expressed by
          J. Kaftan (Wesen der christlichen Religion, Bielefeld, 1881, pp.
          67, 292) in the form "blessedness is enjoyment of the highest
          good." Into Christian usage there has come a transcendent
          element, implying the satisfaction of all needs which present
          themselves to the people of God. If among these needs is classed
          complete communion with God in the completely realized kingdom
          of God, or intercommunion of mankind made one in God, the
          satisfaction of this need goes on to God as the source, and to
          communion with him as the means of attaining such satisfaction.
          Hence in Biblical representations intimate communion with him is
          the highest privilege of which man may think in his Godward
          relations. Companionship with God appears therefore as an
          implicit ground of blessedness, and the Old Testament conception
          comes out in the manifestation of theophanies and in the
          intimate intercourse had by Moses with God (Ex. xxxiii, 11; Num.
          xii, 8; Deut. xxxiv, 10). The idea is still further carried out
          in later books, as in Ps. xvii, 15; cxl, 14 ("I shall be
          satisfied"), and is expressed by Job as a desire (xix, 26). The
          opposite effect is the result of separation from God (Isa.
          xxxviii, 11). Ps. lxxxiv exuberantly sets forth the blessedness
          arising from this companionship with God. In the New Testament
          the same notion of the consciousness of God's presence and of
          faith in him is in evidence (John xiv, 9; II Cor. iv, 6; I Pet.
          i, 8). Yet in this life knowledge of God and communion with him
          is but partial (I Cor. xiii, 12, cf. II Cor. v, 7; Matt. xi,
          27). It is the sons who see the father, and so the sons of the
          Heavenly Father are called blessed (Matt. v, 9). This intimacy,
          which is conditioned upon ethical oneness with God, is the
          source throughout the development of the man of God from which
          he draws the completion of his happiness.

    4. Degrees of Blessedness.

          A difficulty has been encountered in the question whether there
          are steps or grades of blessedness or glory. To this an
          affirmative answer is given on the basis of such passages as
          Matt. x, 41; xiv, 28-29; xxv, 14-15. Such a conclusion is
          fortified by the consideration that blessedness includes within
          itself a kingdom whose subjects are men of God, and that such a
          conception involves diversity in which differences must exist in
          relation to blessedness. Such differences imply variety in order
          of felicity to accord with personal gifts and individuality.

          The figurative language of Heb. iv, 10 makes mention of a final
          Sabbath rest. The question has been raised whether by this is
          meant a state of inactivity or of continued activity. It will be
          noted that the passage refers to the rest following upon
          creation; therefore, not the stagnation of absence of life is
          represented, but the quietude of the achievement of an end. And
          in the Christian imagery of Rev. xxi, 3-4, what is implied is
          the absence of evil, grief, and toil with the unrest which they
          entail. Similarly the inception of the restoration of all things
          (apokatastasis pantOn), in which there is stated an eternity of
          punishment as well as of satisfaction or peace, raises the
          question whether the latter will not be marred because of pity
          on account of the misery of the condemned. Relief is afforded by
          the consideration that the region is one in which ethical
          measures apply, not those of emotion. Dante has the blessed look
          into the mirror of God's heart, which last is the source from
          which the ethical world draws its being and order. In ancient
          times Tertullian (De spectaculis, xxx), in modern times Jonathan
          Edwards held that among the causes of the blessedness of the
          redeemed will be the sight of the misery of the wicked. Edwards
          declared that the "sight of hell torments will exalt the
          happiness of the saints forever" (Works, vol. vi, pp. 120, 426).

          BLESSIG, JOHANN LORENZ: German Protestant; b. at Strasburg Apr.
          15, 1747; d. there Feb. 17,1816. He studied at the university of
          his native city; traveled extensively in Italy, Hungary, and
          Germany; began to preach, and was continually promoted till he
          was in charge of the principal Protestant church of Strasburg;
          became professor in the philosophical faculty in 1778, and in
          the theological, 1787. He was three times rector; his lectures
          covered Greek literature, history of philosophy, Old Testament
          exegesis, dogmatics, and homiletics, and in them all he made the
          practical dominate. His activities carried him into the field of
          politics also, and he was elected to the city council. The
          French Revolution brought upon him exile, a fine, and
          imprisonment for eleven months. Robespierre's downfall restored
          his liberty and he returned to his labors. Church and school
          were reorganized, Blessig's influence being felt everywhere. He
          left no great work, but not less than forty minor writings,
          including several memorial addresses, which were highly esteemed
          in their time. Worthy of special mention are: Ueber Unglauben,
          Aberglauben und Glauben (Strasburg, 1786); De censu Davidico
          Pesteque hunc censum secuta (1788); and De evangeliis secundum
          Ebræos, Ægyptios atque Justini Martyris (1807).

   Blessing and Cursing

  BLESSING AND CURSING.

          Ethnic Conceptions (§ 1).

          In the Old Testament (§ 2).

          Higher and Lower View (§ 3).

    1. Ethnic Conceptions.

          The conception of blessing and cursing has a large part in every
          religion. It refers to the supernatural or divine promotion or
          hindrance to human action and welfare. Sometimes it is
          predicated of man himself as possessing through his connection
          with deity the ability to exercise over another the power
          originally possessed only by deity (cf. Gen. xii, 3; Num. vi,
          24, 27). In this latter case, the power is often exercised by
          means of verbal expression, though it is not confined to that
          means. It is apparent that in the religion of the peoples who
          were neighbors of the Hebrews as well as elsewhere the
          conception of blessing and cursing belonged in the sphere of
          magic. Wizards commanded the blessing and furthering force of
          deity, which they could exercise at a given point for good and
          still more often the power resident in a host of evil spirits,
          to damage or to cause damage at the desired place and time.
          While often power to bless comes not from an equipment gained
          for a special occasion and then lost, continuance of power and
          conditions for evil are especially frequent. The curse lurks in
          the background of earthly existence, enshrined in the form of
          harmful and malicious demons, into whose power a careless word
          or heedless step may instantly cast the unfortunate. According
          to ethnic belief, only the most painstaking care, the most
          punctilious caution, observance of a host of rules and practises
          can enable one to escape danger. Frequently without any overt
          act, by merely mentioning these spirits or by entering their
          domain without adequate protection, the spirits are summoned and
          their power let loose on man, animal, and possessions.

    2. In the Old Testament

          Within the Old Testament there are many traces of the contact of
          Israel with such conceptions. The prophetic religion was
          especially emphatic in its opposition to witchcraft, necromancy,
          and the like, and, especially in the Babylonian age, was not
          successful in combating them. Earlier examples are found in
          Saul's resort to the witch of Endor and the cases suggested by
          Deut. xviii, 10-14, and Isa. ii, 6. It is, then, not surprising
          that the conceptions of blessing and cursing are found together
          among the Hebrews, though they come to have a more spiritual
          content. It is noticeable that the tendency of the development
          was toward a narrowing of the region in which the idea was
          operative, and it was thrust more and more into the background.

          In examining the cases presented in the Old Testament, it
          becomes evident that use was made both of the word of power and
          of an instrument. The staff was used frequently, its use being
          attributed to Moses and Aaron and to the Egyptian magicians (Ex.
          iv, 2; vii, 8 sqq.), while in Hos. iv, 12, it seems to have been
          used to obtain oracles, and possibly it was a magical staff
          which Balaam carried (Num. xxii, 27). It is possible that the
          origin of the staff is to be connected with the idea of the tree
          as the seat of deity (cf. the Asherah and the stake customary at
          the grave). A branch from a tree was either the seat of deity or
          the symbol of his power. A farther means of operating,
          especially for evil, was the glance of the eye (cf. the common
          notion of the "evil eye"). Cases of this in the Old Testament
          are suggested by Prov. xxiii, 6; xxviii, 22 (cf. Ecclus. xiv, 3;
          Pirk?e Abot v, 13). The laying on of hands seems to have had
          close connection with the operation of blessing (Gen. xxvii,
          xlviii, 14 sqq.), the idea being that in this way the person
          bestowing the blessing caused to pass to the recipient some of
          the power which was his, especially if he were a man of God.

          Blessing and cursing were often connected with things holy,
          particularly with sacrifice. By means of these a blessing or a
          curse were often bespoken. So in Judges ix, 27 the cursing of
          Abimelech was evidently closely bound up with the feast in the
          temple of the deity. The episode of Balaam also makes evident
          the connection between sacrifice and curse (or blessing, Num.
          xxiii, 1 sqq.), and the same fact has been noted among Arabs of
          ancient and modern times. A special case is that of the ordeal
          by water, narrated in Num. v, 11 sqq. Blessing and curse operate
          also through the spoken word, which may take either the phase of
          a magical formula or of a prayer of which the content is
          spiritually pure. The latter is of very frequent occurrence in
          the Old Testament, where the blessing, or equally the curse, is
          besought of God.

          This practise of seeking blessing or curse had continuing vogue
          in the common religious ideas of Israel, remaining in evidence
          down to prophetic times. As elsewhere, so among the Hebrews,
          superstition and the practise of magic never completely died
          out, and not only deity but the spirits of the dead (I Sam.
          xxviii) and of ancestors were invoked to give effect to the
          invocation or the imprecation. The deity is in mind in Samuel's
          blessing of the meal (I Sam. ix, 13), in Eli's blessing of
          Hannah (I Sam. i, 17), in the blessing of Rebecca by her
          brothers (Gen. xxiv, 60), and in Solomon's blessing (I Kings
          viii, 15 sqq.). There is every reason to assume that on
          occasions of gatherings such as sacrifices and feasts the
          priests besought a blessing for the people. While such
          invocations did not always take a fixed form, there must have
          been a tendency in that direction, as is proved by the priestly
          blessing in, Num. vi, 24-26. And there is a suggestion of a
          fixed formula for the curse in I Kings viii and in the alternate
          words of blessing and cursing in Deut. xxviii.

          If it be asked who are the persons who may bless or curse, it is
          always found that they are those in especially close relation to
          deity, either seer or priest or man of God. Of these Moses,
          Balaam, Joshua (Josh. vi, 26), Elisha (II Kings ii, 24-25) are
          examples. And like persons are among the Arabs conceived as
          possessing the power. Special power in this matter is also
          ascribed to the dying, who are already on the border between the
          human and the divine. Thus Moses when dying blesses his people
          (Deut. xxxiii), and the dying patriarchs Isaac and Jacob
          distribute both blessing and its opposite when on the eve of
          dissolution (Gen. xxvii, 10 sqq., xlviii, 8 sqq., xlix, 2 sqq.).
          Under special stress the power to bless or curse, especially the
          latter, is attributed to almost any one, as when the Arabs
          assert that one influenced by anger may effectively pronounce a
          curse. Such a case is presented in II Sam. xvi, 5 (cf. verse
          10); and another in the narrative of II Sam. xxi, 1 sqq. Prov.
          xxvii, 14 presents a peculiar case, in which the early and loud
          call may be thought of as arousing the spirits of malice and
          letting them loose on the object of the call. A similar
          conception is involved in Amos vi, 10. The name of Yahweh, who
          lingers near occupied in the work of the plague, is not to be
          spoken lest by the mere utterance he be summoned to the spot and
          slay the only surviving member of the household.

    3. Higher and Lower View.

          Investigation into the way in which blessing and cursing operate
          in the Old Testament shows a lower and a higher view. Not
          infrequently the mere vocal expression of the wish works out the
          fulfilment in a kind of blind compulsion such as takes place in
          ethnic magic (cf. Gen. xxvii, 33 sqq.--the blessing has been
          uttered over Jacob and can not be recalled--and Num. xxii sqq.,
          especially xxii, 6, "I know that he whom thou blessest is
          blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed," the words of Balak
          to Balsam). An illuminating case is given in the connection of
          Josh. vi, 26 with I Kings xvi, 34, in which the ancient curse
          pronounced upon him who should rebuild Jericho works itself out
          in the death of the youngest and the eldest sons of Hiel the
          Bethelite. And a similar instance is Saul's breach of the treaty
          with the Gibeonites in which the curse operates after his death
          until reparation is made with blood (II Sam. xxi). David's
          charge to Solomon (I Kings ii, 5 sqq.; cf. II Sam. xvi, 13)
          furnishes other examples. Solomon is to take vengeance on Shimei
          and on Joab. The former had pronounced a heavy curse on David.
          Since it was yet operative but had not fallen on David himself,
          it must work itself out on his house. But it can be so diverted
          as to fall on the head of its formulator and become changed into
          a blessing for David's family. On the other hand, Joab's deeds
          of blood laid David, Joab's lord, under a curse which could be
          relieved only by expiation exacted from the perpetrator of the
          deeds [cf. on this EB, i, 1034, note 1].

          While this inevitability is to be recognized in the Old
          Testament as inherent by the mere formulation of blessing and
          cursing or curse, the act takes on more and more the character
          of the expression of a wish to be fulfilled by Yahweh, and so it
          becomes distinguished in form and character from magic and
          witchcraft. And while the method of operation is thus
          transferred, the character of the blessing sought changes from
          the material to the spiritual. Thus in the priestly blessing of
          Num. vi, 24-26 there is doubtless in mind the highest good of
          God's grace and peace, and in this light is to be construed
          verse 27. A similar content is to be recognized in Gen. xii, 3
          and parallel passages: "In thee shall all families of the earth
          bless them selves," i.e., shall wish for themselves the very
          blessing which Abraham had obtained.

          As oracles were quoted among the heathen, so sayings attributed
          to Yahweh or spoken in his name were cited among the Hebrews,
          and blessings and curses appear almost in profusion in the Old
          Testament, derived from prophetic or ancestral authority. These
          take on often a cryptic character and anticipate the more
          extended apocalyptic writings of later times (cf. the sayings
          ascribed to Moses and to Jacob in Gen. xlix and Deut. xxxiii).

          The uncertainty of the original significance of the practise is
          disclosed by an examination of the etymology of the words used.
          The technical Hebrew term for cursing is arar, the meaning of
          which was evidently to press heavily upon one. Alongside this
          was used for the curse a word derived from alah, connected with
          the word el, "God." This last implies a calling upon deity or a
          reference to him as agent, a meaning which recalls the idea in
          the German segnen, "to (make the) sign (of the cross over one)."
          But another root also used, k?alal, had no inherent reference to
          the deity, meaning simply "to vilify." So the original sense of
          the word obscure meaning "to curse," is uncertain. Not less
          obscure is the original meaning of the word for blessing,
          berakhah. It has been referred to berekh, "knee," suggesting the
          meaning "to bow the knee." But that the idea of worship was
          originally connected with the word or that it meant "to pray"
          does not appear probable. It is possible to relate it to
          berekhah, meaning an accumulation of the growth and fruitfulness
          attributed to water and, then the attainment of prosperity.

          A noteworthy expression is that which appears quite frequently
          (e.g., Gen. ix, 26), "

          Blessed be Yahweh." Is this only a manner of speech equivalent
          to "Yahweh be praised"? While this may be the sense in later
          ages, it was hardly so in early times. It has doubtless come
          down as a survival of the conception that even deity might be
          blessed by the utterance of some highly endowed individual.

   Blommaerdine, Hadewich (Hadewijch)
          BLOMMAERDINE, blem´´mar-dî´ne, HADEWICH or HADEWIJCH: A
          heretical mystic whose religious activity and writings caused
          great excitement in Brussels early in the 14th century. Her
          adherents venerated her as a saint and her writings as divine
          revelations; her opponents charged her with heretical teaching
          on the freedom of the spirit, and with mingling religious
          devotion and sensual passion. During his stay in Brussels
          (1317-43), Ruysbroeck conducted a strong polemical campaign
          against her, which, however, did not prevent people from coming
          after her death to seek the cure of diseases by touching her
          shroud. The scanty notices which Ruysbroeck's biographer gives
          of her life and writings have been recently filled out by the
          scholarly investigations of K. Ruelens and P. Fredericq. They
          have shown it to be extremely probable that the mystic was
          identical with the important Flemish poetess Hadewijch
          (erroneously called "Sister Hadewijch"), whose remains in prose
          and verse, known only in part heretofore, have been published in
          full by J. Vercoullie (Ghent, 1877). The principal theme of all
          these writings is love (Minne) for God. The specimens given by
          Fredericq display the tempestuous, sometimes actually sensual,
          passion with which she longs for mystical union with him. In
          describing her numerous visions the poetess boasts of very
          intimate relations with Christ and the saints, and claims the
          gift of prophecy and the power of working miracles. She
          expresses herself bitterly in regard to the persecutions set on
          foot by her enemies, the vremden, against herself and her
          adherents, whom she calls vriende, the nuwen or volmaakten der
          Minne (perfeti). In one place she gives the number of her then
          living followers (principally nuns or Beguines) as ninety-seven,
          of whom twenty-nine were outside the Netherlands. Apparently the
          domicella Heilwigis dicta Blammardine, the daughter of William
          Blommaert, a rich and noble citizen of Brussels, who died about
          1336, is the same as the mystic and the poetess. It appears that
          as late as the beginning of the fifteenth century the
          Inquisition in Brussels was still obliged to proceed against
          adherents of the heresies promulgated by her, which were not far
          removed from the views of the Brethren of the [433]Free Spirit.

   Blondel, David
          BLONDEL, DAVID: French Protestant theologian; b. at
          Châlons-sur-Marne 1590; d. at Amsterdam 1655. He belonged to a
          noble family of Champagne; studied classics at the College of
          Sédan and theology at the Academy of Geneva; was called as
          pastor to Houdan (Île de France), then to Roucy on the estate of
          La Rochefoucauld. Because of his great knowledge of the
          Scriptures and of ecclesiastical history, he was chosen more
          than twenty times secretary of the provincial synod of Île de
          France. His writings in defense of the Protestants against their
          Roman Catholic opponents won for him a great reputation for
          scholarship. In 1631 he was appointed professor of divinity at
          Saumur, but his pariah of Roucy declined to give him up. For his
          contributions to the history of the Reformation, the National
          Council of Charenton allowed him an annuity of 1,000 livres,
          enabling him to devote himself to his studies without fear of
          want. After the death of Vossius in 1650, he was appointed
          professor of history at the École Illustre at Amsterdam. Pierre
          Bayle said of him: "He was a man who had an unbounded knowledge
          of religious and profane history." He was accused by the
          orthodox party of Arminianism and of indifference to his church;
          he also endured much from political opponents on account of an
          article against Cromwell written during the war between Great
          Britain and Holland. His works were in part: Modeste déclaration
          de la sincérité et vérité des Églises réformées de France
          (Sédan, 1619); Pseudo-Isidorus et Turrianus vapulantes (Geneva,
          1628); Eclaircissements familiers de la controverse de
          l'Eucharistie (Quevilly, 1641); De la primauté en l'Église
          (Geneva, 1641); Des Sibylles, célébrées tant par l'antiquité
          payenne que par les Saints-Pères (Charenton, 1649); Actes
          authentiques des Églises réformées de France, Germanie,

   Blood-Brotherhood
          BLOOD-BROTHERHOOD. See [434]Comparative Religion, VI, 1, b, § 6.

   Blood-Revenge
          BLOOD-REVENGE: A custom nearly universal in the tribal or clan
          stage of society, often surviving later, binding the kin of a
          murdered man to secure satisfaction for the murder by the death
          of the slayer or of one of his clan. The custom depends upon two
          fundamentals of that stage of civilization: (1) the sacredness
          of life and the solidarity of the clan; (2) the lex talionis.
          Its essence is execution of the slayer or some of his kin by the
          representatives of the slain, not by public authorities; it
          belongs therefore to private as opposed to public justice. In
          nomadic society the perpetuation of the clan depends upon its
          fighting strength and its sense of unity. Hence assault upon a
          member of the clan, if attended with even unintended fatal
          results, involves the tribe, clan, or family of the slain in
          what is felt to be a sacred duty, the avenging of the shedding
          of blood. The custom is important from the standpoint of
          utilitarian ethics, since the knowledge that reparation will be
          demanded by the clan of the assailed restrains a potential
          assailant from wanton attack and makes men more careful in
          ordinary intercourse. The duty set by the institution is
          binding, and so close is the relationship in the clan (see
          [435]Comparative Religion, VI, 1, b, § 1) that all its members
          may become involved, the result being a blood-feud between the
          clans of the assailant and the victim. Usually, however, the
          duty devolves upon the next of kin. Refusal on his part to
          exercise his right and perform his duty subjects him to utter
          contempt and even to outlawry.

          In the advance of civilization the State assumes exclusively the
          function of [436]Capital Punishment and the custom becomes
          obsolete. The Hebrew legislation furnishes an example of an
          intermediate condition, by which the right of the family of a
          man deliberately (not wantonly) murdered to execute justice was
          recognized and the murderer, when captured, was delivered by the
          authorities to the avenger of blood (go'el haddam, Lev. xix,
          11-13; Num. xxxv, 19, 21, 27; for the general law of murder
          among the Hebrews consult Gen. ix, 6; Ex. xxi, 12; Lev. xxiv,
          17; Josh. xx). Even in the case of accidental killing, the
          avenger of blood might kill the slayer if before the death of
          the high priest he found him outside the city of refuge in which
          he had taken sanctuary. See [437]Law, Hebrew, Civil and
          Criminal, III.

          Stuttgart Apr. 29, 1779; d. in Basel Dec. 19, 1838. He studied
          at Tübingen; in 1803 became secretary of the Deutsche
          Christentumsgesellschaft in Basel; minister at Bürg,
          Württemberg, 1807; returned in 1816 to Basel as director of the
          missionary school. From 1816 he edited the Missionsmagazin, and
          from 1828 also the Heidenbote; he published Versuch einer
          allgemienen Missionsgeschichte der Kirche Christi (5 vols.,
          Basel, 1828-37), reaching down to the time of the Reformation.

   Blumhardt, Johann Christoph
          BLUMHARDT, JOHANN CHRISTOPH: German Lutheran; b. at Stuttgart
          July 16, 1805 d. at Boll (5 miles s.w. of Göppingen) Feb. 25,
          1880. He studied at Tübingen; became teacher at the missionary
          institution at Basel 1830; succeeded pastor Barth at Möttlingen,
          near Calw, 1838. By the reported cure by prayer of a girl named
          Gottliebin Dittus, supposed to be a demoniac, which cure was
          effected after a two years' struggle, Blumhardt gained great
          fame. A revival followed, attended by so many people from so
          large an area that on Good Friday, 1845, no less than 176
          localities were represented at the service. At his services, so
          it is reported, healing of physical infirmities resulted from
          Blumhardt's laying on of hands in token of absolution. Blumhardt
          received calls to other places, but felt that his gifts and time
          belonged to the "distressed"; in order to be able to devote
          himself entirely to them, he bought in 1853 the royal
          watering-place Boll, which became an asylum for sufferers of all
          kinds, and from all ranks of society. The girl he had cured went
          with him as an assistant, accompanied by a brother and a sister
          whom Blumhardt had also cured. In 1869 and 1872 his sons joined
          him in the work. From all countries the afflicted flocked to his
          asylum, where his unique treatment seemed to give them new vital
          energy. At last sickness attacked him, and he ordained his son
          to the work with the words "I consecrate thee to victory." In
          1899 this son withdrew from the clergy, but continued to
          maintain the establishment at Boll.

          In 1824 he was a resident licentiate in Andover Theological
          Seminary. In 1825 he went out to Burma under the Baptist Board
          of Missions, which had accepted his services in 1823, but owing
          to the Burmese war he could not reach that country till 1827.
          After a year at Maulmain he opened the new station at Tavoy, 150
          miles north, and there he immersed the first Karen convert--Ko
          Tha Byu. From this center he prosecuted a very successful
          missionary work, but pulmonary disease caused his death after
          less than three years.

   Boardman, George Nye
          BOARDMAN, GEORGE NYE: American Congregationalist; b. at
          Pittsford, Vt., Dec. 23, 1825. He was graduated at Middlebury
          College, Vt. (B.A., 1847), and Andover Theological Seminary
          (1852). He was tutor at Middlebury College, in 1847-49, and
          after the completion of his theological studies was appointed
          professor of rhetoric and English literature in Middlebury
          College, also acting as temporary professor of intellectual
          philosophy. Six years later (1859), he accepted a call to the
          pastorate of the First Presbyterian Church at Binghamton, N. Y.,
          where he remained until 1871, when he was chosen professor of
          systematic theology in Chicago Theological Seminary. He resigned
          from this position in 1893, with the title of professor
          emeritus. He was the first moderator of the new synod after the
          reunion of the Old School and New School Presbyterian Churches,
          being also chairman of the committee for the formation of new
          presbyteries. He was also moderator of the Congregational
          General Association of Illinois in 1881, and has been a
          corporate member of the American Board of Commissioners for
          Foreign Missions since 1869. He prepared the section on
          systematic theology in the seven volumes of Current Discussion,
          issued by the faculty of the Chicago Theological Seminary
          (Chicago, 1883-89), and has also written Lectures on Natural
          Theology (1881); Congregationalism (1889); Regeneration (1891);
          and History of New England Theology (New York, 1899).

   Bochart, Samuel
          BOCHART, bO´´sh??r´, SAMUEL: French Protestant; b. at Rouen
          1599; d. at Caen 1667. His father was the learned René Bochart,
          pastor at Rouen, and his mother Esther du Moulin. At the age of
          fourteen he made Greek verses in honor of his masters. He
          studied philosophy at Sédan, theology at Saumur under Cameron,
          whom he accompanied to London in 1621. He did not stay long, but
          soon returned to Leyden, where he took up theology and the study
          of the Arabic language under Erpenius. He was appointed
          Protestant minister at Caen, but gave private lessons in a Roman
          Catholic family. His controversy with the Jesuit Véron, in 1628,
          gave him a great name, and he edited an account of it (2 vols.,
          Saumur, 1630) to refute Véron's teachings. In 1652 Queen
          Christina of Sweden wished his presence and he followed her
          call, accompanied by his pupil Huet, later bishop of Avranches.
          He remained in Stockholm one year, studying Arabic texts in the
          queen's library. Returning to Caen, he became the representative
          of Normandy at the National Calvinist Synod of Loudun. He died
          suddenly during a session of the academy at Caen. His works
          include Theses theologicæ de verbo Dei (Saumur, 1620); Actes de
          la conférence tenue à Caen entre Samuel Bochart et Jean
          Baillehache, ministres de la parole de Dieu en l'Église réformée
          . . . et François Véron (2 vols., 1630); Réponse à la lettre du

          historian; b. at Felsö-Csernáton (a village of Transylvania)
          Feb. 12, 1712; d. at Magyar-Igen (40 m. s.w. of Klausenburg)
          Mar. 3, 1769. He was educated at the Reformed college of
          Nagy-Enyed and the University of Leyden, and in 1743 became
          pastor at Héviz, whence he was called, six years later, to
          Magyar-Igen. He was the author of fifty-six works, of which
          twenty-three were printed, but by a decree of Maria Theresa
          restricting the liberty of the press certain of his books of a
          patriotic and Protestant tendency were confiscated. Among his
          works in Hungarian special mention may be made of the following,
          the titles being translated into English: "History of the Holy

          1872 he has devoted himself to the work of the [440]Innere
          Mission at Bielefeld, and the following institutions have been
          founded by his exertions: the Bethel house for epileptics with
          1,800 inmates; the Sarepta deaconesses' house with 980 sisters
          located in 326 stations, of which eleven are in foreign

   Boehm, Hans
          BOEHM, HANS: A popular preacher of the fifteenth century, known
          as the Drummer of Niklashausen; executed July 19, 1476. He was
          originally a shepherd at Helmstadt, between Würzburg and
          Wertheim. Up to the beginning of 1476, he had been used to play
          the drum and fife for rustic dances, but what he heard of the
          preaching of the Franciscan Capistrano (see [442]Capistrano,
          Giovanni di) worked a great change in him. He alleged that the
          Virgin Mary had appeared to him and called him to be a prophet
          and preacher of repentance. In the village of Niklashausen near
          his home there was a picture of her already reputed miraculous
          and visited by pilgrims. Here, at the end of March, he began to
          preach, having burnt his drum in token of conversion. Lacking
          not only secular education but even elementary religious
          knowledge, he yet made a deep impression on his hearers by the
          innocence and purity of his nature. He did not stop with calling
          the peasants to repentance, but showed increasing bitterness
          against the clergy and nobles, who, he said, would find no place
          in the kingdom announced to him by the Virgin; taxes were to be
          abolished, no one was to have more than another, and all men
          were to live as brothers. His fame soon spread throughout
          central and southern Germany, and crowds of pilgrims, put as
          high as 40,000, thronged to hear him. He seems to have intended
          to lead them in an armed rising; but Bishop Rudolf of Würzburg
          had him arrested on July 12, and warded off the danger of a
          great peasants' war. Two days later, 16,000 of his followers
          appeared to rescue him, but were dispersed; and on the 19th, a
          recantation having been extorted from him, he perished on the
          scaffold as a heretic and enchanter.

    1. Early Tendency Toward Mysticism.

          The famous German mystic Jakob Böhme (often written Behmen or
          Boehme in English), born at Alt-Seidenberg, near Görlitz, Nov.,
          1575; d. at Görlitz Nov. 17, 1624. His parents were peasants,
          from whom he inherited, it seems, a strain of visionary
          mysticism. Unable to bear the rough outdoor life of the farm, he
          was put to shoemaking in the little town of Seidenberg, where he
          had a hard apprenticeship with a family that had no Christian
          principles, and got an early insight into the controversies of
          the age. With diligent reading of the Bible and prayer for the
          illumination of the Holy Spirit he combined eager study of the
          works of fanatical visionaries, such as Paracelsus, Weigel, and
          Schwenckfeld, by means of which he felt himself elevated above
          the strife of tongues around him into the light and joy of the
          contemplation of God. He settled, as master of his trade, at
          Görlitz in 1599. He had his shop there until 1613, and must have
          prospered to a certain extent, since he bought a house in 1610
          and had fully paid for it in 1618. He married a master butcher's
          daughter in 1599, and had four sons and two daughters, passing
          as a model husband and father among his neighbors. All these
          things go to show that he had a practical hold on life, and was
          far from being a mere crazy visionary.

    2. Mystic Visions.

          A visionary, however, he remained. He tells the story of a
          stranger coming into his shop and calling him by name, taking
          him aside to tell him he should be so great that the world
          should wonder at him, and warning him to remain true to the Word
          of God and to a life of virtue. Other visions followed. One day
          the reflection of the sun from a bright metal vessel in his shop
          seemed to infuse such spiritual light into his soul that the
          inner mysteries of things were laid open to his sight. He went
          out into the fields to seek the revelation of God's will in
          earnest prayer, and found his peace and joy only grow the
          deeper. None the less, ten years passed before he ventured to
          put down in writing what he had seen, and then he did so only on
          the encouragement of a new vision and as a memorandum for
          himself.

    3. Opposition to his First Book.

          The incomplete manuscript, written in great haste, which he
          called Aurora oder die Morgenröte im Aufgang, began to circulate
          among his acquaintances at the instance of Karl von Ender, a
          friendly noble man who was an adherent of Schwenckfeld's. In
          this way it came under the notice of Gregorius Richter, the
          pastor of Görlitz, who at once began a fanatical war upon the
          presumptuous shoemaker, and urged the local magistrate to
          suppress him, lest the wrath of God should fall upon the town.
          Böhme was minutely examined before the council, and only
          dismissed on promising to write no more books. The observance of
          this promise, however, was not only made difficult by the
          insistence of his friends, but by his own inner feeling that the
          fear of men had driven him to deny the grace of God that was in
          him. The bitter abuse of Richter, too, still continued, and
          after five years of silence, during which he had learned a good
          deal and developed more, Böhme could bear it no longer, and,
          encouraged by a fresh vision, again took up his pen. His new
          writings were at first circulated only in manuscript copies.
          Richter, who thought himself the appointed guardian of
          orthodoxy, thundered against him from the pulpit and attacked
          him in a vulgar lampoon, which Böhme answered in a tone
          naturally excited, but still showing a nobler spirit than the
          absurdly haughty and unchristian contempt of the attack. Far
          from having broken with the word of God and the sacraments, he
          was trying to live as an upright Christian, in strict
          self-discipline; and although among his twenty-eight works there
          are some which directly attack the visible Church as Babel, the
          city of confusion, and set forth Christ in us as the mystical
          ideal, his general attitude by no means justifies the scornful
          "Shoemaker, stick to thy last" of his opponent.

    4. Finds Sympathy In Dresden.

          In 1624 he was obliged to leave Görlitz, and went to Dresden,
          where he found shelter in the house of the director of the
          Elector's chemical laboratory and enjoyed the society of many of
          the most intellectual people of the court and the capital. In
          May he had a hearing before several distinguished clerics and
          professors, who fully recognized his mental endowments, and
          encouraged him to go home, especially as his family, deprived of
          its head, had been exposed to no little suffering in the
          confusion of the Thirty Years' War.

    5. Death of Böhme.

          He returned to Görlitz, but his end was near. When he asked for
          communion upon his death-bed, the successor of Richter, a man
          like-minded, would only give it to him after a searching
          examination, of which the report is still extant. Full of
          confidence, however, and with heavenly voices ringing in his
          ears, Böhme took leave of his wife and children and died with
          the joyful cry "I go to Paradise!" In spite of clerical
          opposition, a befitting funeral was provided by the town
          authorities; a cross was put up over the grave by his friends,
          to be defiled and thrown down by the populace.

    6. His Writings.

          Thus despised and rejected in his own day, Böhme has been
          honored by some of the greatest minds of Germany in a later age;
          such men as Friedrich von Hardenberg, Jung-Stilling, Friedrich
          Schlegel and Ludwig Tieck, Hegel and Schelling received valuable
          intellectual impulses from his works, which also attracted much
          attention in England, where a complete translation appeared
          between 1644 and 1682. Besides those already named, the most
          important are Von den drei Principien göttlichen Wesens; Vom
          dreifachen Leben des Menschen; Vierzig Fragen von der Seele; Von
          wahrer Busse; Das Gespräch einer unerleuchteten Seele; and Der
          Weg zu Christo; including two against predestinarianism and two
          against pantheism. Böhme's influence has never been a popular
          one, because his train of thought is frequently difficult and
          sometimes almost impossible to follow. This is due partly to his
          lack of education, which prevented him from expressing himself
          clearly, but partly also to the depth and intensity of his
          thought, which has to struggle for adequate representation in
          words. With sincere longing, with real hunger of the soul he
          plunges into the depths of God's being.

    7. His Transcendentalism.

          The traditional theology of the schools, with its strife about
          the letter, could not content him. "As the many kinds of flowers
          grow in the earth near each other, and none contends with the
          other about color, smell, or taste, but they let the earth and
          the sun, rain and wind, heat and cold, do what they will with
          them, while they grow each according to its own nature, so is it
          with the children of God." And he was simply a child of God,
          that longed to grow and approach more closely to God. In this
          effort he studied the Bible and clung to it, but nature and
          life, to say nothing of the writings of earlier enthusiasts,
          contributed their part.

    8. His Essential Orthodoxy.

          He held fast to the fundamental doctrines of his Church, the
          Trinity, the Incarnation, the Atonement. "That which is said of
          God, that he is Father, Son, and Holy Ghost, is truly said; but
          it must be explained, or the unenlightened can not comprehend
          it." "Thou must not think the Son is another God from the
          Father, or that he is outside the Father, as when two men stand
          side by side. The Father is the source of all forces, and all
          forces are in each other as one force; and thus he is called one
          God. The Son is the Father's heart, the heart or center of all
          the powers of the Father. From the Son rises the eternal
          heavenly joy, having its source in all the powers of the Father,
          a joy that no eye has seen, and no ear heard." Christ, the
          Father's heart, descended into the midst of the conflagration
          which had broken out in the world, extinguished it by his death,
          and by his resurrection, the resurrection of the God-Man, raised
          man to participation in the Godhead. The Scripture is the
          receptacle of the truth; he holds to it, and its sense alone
          (cf. Col. i, 15-20) teaches a cosmic, universal conception of
          Christianity; baptism and the Lord's supper are means of grace
          to him. He remains, in spite of all obscurities, a man of
          inspiration who raised Protestant mysticism to a great height,
          and not only endowed it with the riches of his own meditations
          but, through his "theosophic Pentecostal school, in which the
          soul is taught by God," has shown many others the way to a deep
          and abiding happiness.

          b. at Stettin May 24, 1827; d. at Lichtental Feb. 5,1906. He was
          educated at the universities of Halle and Berlin, and in 1854
          became privat-docent for theology in Halle. He later turned his
          attention to Romance, and in 1866 was appointed associate
          professor in that subject in Halle, becoming full professor two
          years later. In 1872 he was called to Strasburg in the same
          capacity, but retired with the title of professor emeritus in
          1879. Among his numerous works those of theological importance
          are Ueber Verfasser und Abfassungszeit der johanneischen
          Apokalypse (Halle, 1855); Das erste Buch des Thora (1862);
          Franzisca Hernandez und Frai Franzisco Ortiz (Leipsic, 1866);

   Boehmer, Justus Henning
          BOEHMER, JUSTUS HENNING: A jurist who made important
          contributions to the study of Roman and still more of canon law;
          b. at Hanover Jan. 29, 1674; d. at Halle Aug. 23 or 29, 1749, as
          chancellor of the duchy of Magdeburg and head of the faculty of
          law at Halle. He rendered a great service to the continuity of
          Protestant church law in that he was the first to show the
          adaptability of the older canonical principles to
          post-Reformation conditions. This was made possible by his
          profound knowledge of church history and his extensive
          theoretical and practical acquaintance with both the common and
          the statute law. In the question of the relation of Church and
          State he declared for the territorial system. Out of the large
          number of his writings may be mentioned the Duodecim
          dissertationes juris ecclesiastici ad Plinium Secundum et
          Tertullianum (2d ed., Halle, 1729); Entwurf des Kirchenstaats
          derer ersten drei Jahrhundert . . . (1733); Institutiones juris
          canonici (5th ed., 1770); Jus ecclesiasticum Protestantium (6
          vols., 1714); and an edition of the Corpus juris canonici (2
          vols., 1747), valuable for its notes, index, and appendices. He
          also made some contributions to church hymnody. He was the
          founder of a family of jurists, two of whom deserve mention for
          their contributions to the study of canon law. These are his
          son, Georg Ludwig, b. 1715; d. 1797, as head of the law faculty
          at Göttingen; author of Principia juris canonici
          (Göttingen,1762), which was used in the revision of the Prussian
          laws; and Georg Ludwig's son, Georg Wilhelm (1761-1839), who
          published Grundriss des protestantischen Kirchenrechts
          (Göttingen,1786) and other cognate works.

          pastor at Glattfelden, Canton Zurich, 1842; resigned, 1853;
          removed to Zurich, and then to Basel. He wrote, from the sources
          and in a scholarly manner, a series of biographies which
          constituted a church history down to pre-Reformation times,

          BOËTHIUS, bO-î´thi-Us, ANICIUS MANLIUS SEVERINUS: Statesman and
          philosopher; b. at Rome, of wealthy and influential family, c.
          480; executed at Pavia 525. He received as good an education as
          the time could give, and acquired a close acquaintance with
          Greek philosophy. In 510 he was consul, and for several years
          occupied a prominent position in the Roman world, equally
          revered by the people and esteemed by the Ostrogothic king,
          Theodoric, the ruler of Italy (489-526). After the decree of the
          Emperor Justin I (518-527) against the Arians, Theodoric became
          suspicious of all Romans and Catholics; he imprisoned Boëthius
          at Pavia on a charge of desiring to restore the old Roman
          freedom, and finally put him to death. By his translations and
          commentaries (including the entire six books of the Organon of
          Aristotle and the Isagoge of Porphyry) and by his independent
          works (Introductio ad categoricos syllogismos, De syllogismo
          categorico, De syllogismo hypothetico, De divisione, De
          definitione, De musica, De arithmetica, etc.), Boëthius became
          the connecting link between the logical and metaphysical Science
          of antiquity and the scientific attempts of the Middle Ages. His
          influence on medieval thought was still greater through his De
          consolatione philosophiæ (written while in prison at Pavia) and
          the theological writings attributed to him. Whether Boëthius was
          a Christian has been doubted; and it is certain that the
          Consolotio makes no mention of Christ, and all the comfort it
          contains it owes to the optimism of the Neoplatonic school and
          to the stoicism of Seneca. Nevertheless, for a long time the
          book was read with the greatest reverence by all Christendom,
          and its author was regarded as a martyr for the true faith.
          Having advanced from a mere logician to a moralist, he next came
          to be regarded as a theologian; but it is not probable that he
          wrote any of the theological works attributed to him. The
          tradition is very old, however; he is mentioned by Alcuin as the
          author of De sancta trinitate, and by Hincmar of Reims as author
          of a treatise, Utrum pater et filius et spiritus sanctus de
          divinitate substantialiter prædicentur.

          Bibliography: The complete works of Boëthius first appeared at
          Venice, 1492; again at Basel, 1546 and 1570; they are reproduced
          in MPL lxiii-lxiv. The Consolatio philosophiæ was first printed
          at Nuremberg, 1473; a good edition is by Peiper, Leipsic, 1871;
          there have been many English translations, beginning with King
          Alfred's Anglo-Saxon version, and including one by Chaucer and
          one ascribed to Queen Elizabeth; a late translation is by H. R.
          James, London, 1897. The translations from Aristotle were
          published by C. Meiser, 2 vols., Leipsic, 1877-80; the De
          arithmetica, De musica, and De geometrica by G. Friedlein, ib.
          1867. The theological writings appeared at Louvain in 1633 and
          are in Peiper's edition of the Consolatio (ut sup.). Consult: F.

   Bogatzky, Karl Heinrich von
          BOGATZKY, KARL HEINRICH VON: German Pietist; b. at Jankowe (a
          village of Lower Silesia) Sept. 7, 1690; d. at Halle June 15,
          1774. When fourteen years of age, he entered the ducal court of
          Saxe-Weissenfels as a page, but at the instance of the pious
          count Henry XXIV of Reuse-Köstritz, he began to complete his
          education in his twentieth year. From 1713 to 1715 he studied
          law at Jena and then devoted himself to theology at Halle, where
          Francke, Anton, Freylinghausen, and other Pietists greatly
          influenced him. After completing his theological studies in
          1718, he lived for several years among the nobility of Silesia,
          and exercised much influence as a spiritual leader. He also
          resided for a number of years at the Silesian village of
          Glaucha, where he aided in building an orphan-asylum, and from
          1740 to 1746 he lived at the ducal court of Saalfeld, and
          finally at Halle, engaged in literary work of a devotional
          character and in the practical furtherance of Pietistic life.
          The most popular of his many works was his Güldenes
          Schatzkästlein der Kinder Gottes, which he composed for his own
          edification while at the university (Breslau, 1718; 65th ed.,
          Halle, 1904; Eng. transl., London, 1745, and many subsequent
          editions); while among his other books special mention may be
          made of his Tägliches Hausbuch der Kinder Gottes (2 vols.,
          Halle, 1748-49) and of his Betrachtungen und Gebete über das
          Neue Testament (7 parts, 1755-61). Several of his hymns obtained
          a place in the popular hymnals of the German people, and were
          collected in his Uebung der Gottseligkeit in allerlei
          geistlichen Liedern (Halle, 1749), while a selection of 160, was
          published by Johannes Claassen, (Stuttgart, 1888), together with
          a biography of Bogatzky.

          d. at Brighton Oct. 25, 1825. He studied at Edinburgh (M.A.,

          1780, while minister of a Congregational chapel at Gosport
          (opposite Portsmouth), he undertook the instruction of young men
          for the ministry, and from this beginning was developed the
          London Missionary Society. He was also active in founding the
          British and Foreign Bible Society and the Religious Tract
          Society. In 1796 with two other ministers and Robert Haldane he
          offered to go to India as a missionary, but the plan was not
          approved by the East India Company. Besides sermons and tracts
          he published An Essay on the Divine Authority of the New
          Testament (London, 1801), and with James Bennett wrote the
          History of Dissenters from the Revolution to 1808 (4 vols.,

  I. Origin and History to 1496.

    1. Origin of the Sect.

          The Compactata of Prague, which marked the political end of the
          Hussite Wars in 1433 (see [447]Huss, John, Hussites), proved
          unsatisfactory to the religious and ecclesiastical demands of
          the majority of the Bohemians. Many scattered communities
          accordingly arose throughout the country, seeking to carry out
          the Reformation in life and doctrine, independent of the
          Waldensians who had long been settled in Bohemia. In 1453-54,
          moreover, the preaching of the Utraquistic archbishop Rokycana
          (pastor of the Teinkirche at Prague after 1448) resulted in the
          formation of a community at Prague, headed by his nephew
          Gregory. The conviction that the validity of the sacraments,
          sermons, prayer, and the like depended on the moral and
          religious character of the priest caused them to seek for "good"
          pastors, and this congregation, together with others and at the
          suggestion of Rokycana, became closely allied with the Chelcic
          Brethren, the followers of a layman named Peter of Chelcic, who
          first appeared at Prague in 1419 and seems to have died before
          1457. He had refused to join any of the Hussite parties, since
          he rejected all temporal defense of the Gospel, and recorded his
          peculiar views in his writings, of which the most important were
          his Netz des wahren Glaubens (1455) and his Postilla (1434-36).
          His ideal of Christian life, the fulfilment of the "law of
          Christ" (Matt. xxii, 37-39; Gal. vi, 2) in public and in private
          life without regard to consequences, and his rejection of all
          that could not be reconciled with this law, such as temporal
          power, wealth, war, and trade, made a profound impression on
          Gregory and his followers, and inspired them to attempt to
          realize this ideal. At their request their friend and counselor
          Rokycana secured permission from King George Podebrad for them
          to settle in the village of Kunwald in the district of Lititz,
          which belonged to him, and they accordingly established their
          colony there in 1457 or 1458, Michael, the pastor of the
          neighboring town of Senftenberg, becoming their spiritual head.
          How large it was, whether including only individuals or entire
          families, is not known, although the latter seems to have been
          the case. At all events, families were soon attracted to
          Kunwald, for the oldest document of the Brethren, a synodical
          resolution of 1464, presupposes the existence of households with
          civil occupations, as well as of widows and orphans.

    2. Early Organization.

          This sketch of the origin of the Bohemian Brethren renders it
          clear that the current view which represents them as remnants of
          the Taborites is incorrect. In 1471 they designated themselves
          as disciples of Rokycana and his colleagues, and declared that
          they had been developed from the older communities mentioned
          above. The main outlines of the organization are contained in
          certain synodical resolutions of 1464-67. The community was
          divided into three groups: beginners or penitents, comprising
          children under the age of twelve and all who sought to enter the
          community from the time they made profession of their desire
          until they were received; the advanced, forming the majority of
          the community and devoting themselves to various civil callings,
          with masters and matrons appointed to supervise and counsel
          them; and the perfected (also called priests; although the
          community then had no specially appointed priesthood), who had
          renounced private property and given their possessions to the
          poor, particularly to those who "journey for the sake of the
          word of God." It was the duty of the perfected to proclaim the
          word and to hear confessions; they were required to travel in
          pairs, instead of alone, to earn a livelihood by the work of
          their hands, and to collect alms regularly, which were destined
          partly for the poor and partly for themselves, in case their
          work was insufficient to support them. Those of the laity,
          either male or female, who had voluntarily chosen poverty, also
          belonged to this class. At the head of the communities stood one
          or more elders, although no details of their duties are known,
          and information is equally scanty regarding the imposition of
          their frequent synods. The Brethren at Kunwald gained an
          increasing number of adherents in Bohemia and Moravia, while
          their opposition to the dominant Church became stronger and
          stronger, especially as a result of the persecution instituted
          against them by King George in 1460. They accordingly felt
          themselves obliged, seven years later, to break entirely with
          the Church by the creation of an independent priesthood, the
          historical course of events being as follows, according to
          Goll's proposed combination of the sources, which are not always
          in entire agreement.

    3. First Priests of the Brethen.

          By a meeting with the Waldensians and their "bishop" Stephen,
          with whom they had become acquainted through Rokycana, the
          Bohemian Brethren had entered into relations with the
          Waldensians previous to 1467. These negotiations proved
          fruitless, however, since the Waldensians as a body would not
          countenance an open break with the Roman Catholic Church. Some
          of them, on the other hand, joined the Brethren, and among this
          number was an old Waldensian priest, who was present, together
          with certain representatives of the German Waldensians, at a
          conference of about sixty Brethren from various parts of Bohemia
          and Moravia which was held, according to a later tradition, at
          Lhotka, a village near Reichenau, in 1467 to choose and ordain
          priests of their own. Fully aware of the momentous nature of
          their proceeding, they wished God himself to decide by lot
          whether the time had come for them to venture the step, and
          which persons should be the first priests. Nine candidates were
          proposed, each of whom was required to draw one of twelve slips,
          nine blank and three containing the word jest ("he is"). In case
          all the candidates drew blanks, the synod was to be adjourned
          for a year. Thomas, Matthias, and Elias, however, drew the three
          written slips, whereupon they were "confirmed" by the laying on
          of hands by the old Waldensian priest, apparently assisted by
          the priest Michael (?), in the name and authority of the synod.
          By a more restricted lot Matthias was chosen from the three to
          have "the first place in authority," or as "bishop," as Michael
          called himself in a conference with the Utraquistic consistory
          in 1478. It was not until May of the following year (1468) that
          the Brethren informed Rokycana of what had occurred, and they
          then seem to have broken definitely with him. They themselves,
          however, were soon divided as to "whether it should so remain,"
          and the result was the decision that Matthias should be
          consecrated bishop by the Waldensian bishop Stephen. Strangely
          enough, the priest Michael was sent, instead of Matthias
          himself. Michael met Stephen in southern Moravia, received
          consecration from him, and gave it, when he returned, to
          Matthias, whereupon he resigned both the authority of bishop,
          which he had received only for this purpose, and also his
          Catholic priesthood, having himself reordained by Matthias as a
          priest of the Brethren, while the new bishop likewise ordained
          Thomas and Elias. This is the account of Michael and other
          eye-witnesses, while later sources, even of the early sixteenth
          century, present many deviations, partly in an endeavor to
          conceal the cooperation of the Waldensians so far as possible.

    4. Relations with the Waldensians.

          The members of this newly constituted community called
          themselves "Brethren," and were known in different portions of
          the country by the names of their chief centers, such as
          Kunwalders, Bunzlau Brethren, and the like. As a whole they
          termed themselves Jednota Bratrská, which they later rendered
          into Latin as Unitas Fratrum. Their characteristic designation
          was Brethren, which had already been current in various older
          Bohemian communities. The name Fratres legis Christi first arose
          in the second half of the sixteenth century, but never became
          general. Their opponents usually termed them Waldensians or
          Pickards (a corruption of Beghards), and this designation, found
          even in the royal decrees, became so general that they
          themselves employed it in the titles of many of their writings,
          terming themselves "the Brethren who for envy and hatred are
          called Waldensians or Pickards." The first result of the events
          of 1467 was a renewal of the persecutions, which lasted until
          the death of George and Rokycana in 1471, and which also
          involved the Waldensians, Stephen being burned at the stake in
          Vienna during this period. This persecution may also have been
          the cause of the renewed attacks on them in Brandenburg, and
          about 1478 two Waldensians accordingly went from that country to
          the Brethren, thus inaugurating an intercommunication between
          the two sects which resulted in a number of Waldensians joining
          the Brethren after 1480 and settling at Landskron in Bohemia and
          at Fulneck in Moravia. In the latter country both sects were
          tolerated under King Matthias, until the end of his reign, when
          a decree of expulsion was issued in 1488, although it was soon
          revoked at the petition of some patrons of high rank. A portion
          of the Brethren had already emigrated to Moldavia, but
          apparently returned within a few years.

          Internal strife, centered about the ideal of Peter mentioned
          above, was more perilous to the maintenance of unity than
          external oppression. A "small" party clung to this ideal, and
          accordingly rejected temporal power, law, service in war, the
          oath, and the like as unchristian, while a "great " party
          regarded all these as dangerous, yet not to be rejected
          unconditionally. The controversies ended in 1494 with the
          victory of the "great" party, the "small" party, who called
          themselves Amosites after their leader Amos, separating as an
          independent community and preserving an existence for several
          decades. During these dissensions two leaders of the "great"
          party, Lukas and Thomas, journeyed to North Italy to visit the
          Lombard Waldensians in their own homes, possibly seeking, in
          view of their disagreement with the "small" party, to make a
          final effort to induce the Waldensians to break openly with
          Rome. A correspondence between the Brethren and the Waldensians
          was associated with this journey, the three Waldensian
          treatises, preserved either entire or in fragments, La epistola
          al serenissimo Rey Lancelau; Ayczo es la causa del nostre
          departiment de la gleysa Romana; and De l'Antichrist, as well as
          the catechism Las interrogations menors, being apparently
          translations or revisions of Bohemian writings composed by the
          Brethren, although the mutual relations are not yet altogether
          clear.

  II. The Brethren under Lukas.

    1. Oppressive Measures of Vladislav.

          The period between 1496 and 1528 is marked by the activity of
          Lukas. Although he was not appointed presiding bishop until
          1517, his influence was potent during the administration of his
          predecessors in office, Procopius (1507) and Thomas of P?elou?
          (1517). His special task was the restoration of the Unity which
          had become necessary in consequence of the secession of the
          "small" party. A mass of ordinances, touching on all the
          relations of life, was prepared to build up the Christian
          community on the principles newly won. The doctrines, which had
          thus far been formulated but feebly, were now systematized on
          other foundations, and from these various points of view Lukas
          developed a noteworthy literary activity. The external existence
          of the Unity was seriously threatened at the beginning of the
          sixteenth century, when Vladislav, who had tolerated them
          hitherto, was induced to proceed against them by Bohuslav of
          Lobkowitz, the foremost representative of Bohemian humanism, who
          saw the roots of manifold evils in religious disunion. At the
          same time Alexander VI sent the Dominican Heinrich Institoris to
          Olmütz as censor of books for Bohemia and Moravia (bull of Feb.
          4, 1500), and he, after a fruitless disputation with certain
          representatives of the Brethren, preached against them with
          extreme severity. The overtures toward a reconciliation between
          Rome and the Utraquists (1501) led the latter to make common
          cause in opposition to the Brethren, and a decree of the king,
          dated July 5, 1503, forbade all further toleration of the sect
          in Prague and the royal cities, while the Roman Catholic estates
          voluntarily enforced this prohibition in their districts. A
          conference held at Prague between the Utraquistic clergy and
          some of the Brethren failed to convince the latter of their
          "errors," nor did a Latin creed given them by the king in 1503
          meet with their approval. He was still more incensed at them by
          two venomous letters of the Olmütz canon Augustine Käsebrut, so
          that he issued a sharp decree against them in 1507. These
          decrees, however, could not become valid until accepted by the
          diet, and Vladislav accordingly proposed a law against the
          Brethren at the diet convoked on July 25, 1508. This was
          accepted by the estates and placed on the code, as in force
          throughout the country. It forbade all public and private
          gatherings of the "Pickards," and ordered the destruction of all
          their books and writings, while they were commanded to attend
          Roman Catholic or Utraquistic churches, their clergy and
          teachers being prisoners of the king unless they should consent,
          after receiving instruction, to join one of these religious
          bodies. The law is said to have been obeyed by all estates until
          Christmas, and those who still tolerated "Pickards" were
          mulcted. This measure conditioned the position of the Brethren
          in Bohemia for almost the entire period of their existence, but
          the Moravian diet refused to accept it. In 1541 the code was
          destroyed by a fire at Prague, so that it became necessary to
          draft the laws anew at following diets. Thereupon the Brethren
          endeavored to secure the abolition of the law, but in vain; nor
          was it repealed until an imperial letter of Rudolf II in 1609.
          It is strikingly suggestive of the political conditions of
          Bohemia in the sixteenth century, however, that a community
          which was legally prohibited, like the Brethren, could attain
          such wide extension and importance. This was possible only
          because the nobles obeyed the laws as they pleased, for the king
          was generally too much occupied with foreign affairs to be able
          to insist rigidly on compliance with his statutes, and in case
          he did attempt to execute them, he was resisted by a coalition
          of the estates, who sought to check all growth of the royal
          power. At first the law was strictly observed, and the Brethren
          were severely oppressed, their meeting-places being closed,
          their priests expelled, and imprisonment and even occasional
          execution serving as deterrent measures. Lukas himself was
          imprisoned, and was freed only by the death of Vladislav on Mar.
          13, 1516. This event lessened the severity of a persecution
          which had been opposed by some estates from the very beginning.
          During the reign of Vladislav's son Louis, which marked a
          further decay of the royal power, the persecution of the
          Brethren ceased altogether, and the governmental center of the
          Unity, which had been transferred to Prerau in Moravia during
          the period of oppression, was again removed to Bohemia, and
          located at Jungbunzlau, the residence of Lukas. While he was
          presiding bishop, the Brethren first came into contact with the
          German Reformation, when Luther learned of their short
          catechism, of which he seems to have received a German
          translation in 1521.

    2. Overtures to the Protestants.

          Although Luther at first declared himself at least in sympathy
          with their doctrine of the Lord's Supper, he became estranged
          from the Brethren after 1524, while their tendency to remain
          aloof, so far as possible, from the Lutheran movement was
          strengthened by the vagaries of Gallus Cahera in Prague
          (1523-29), especially since it resulted in the enforcement by
          the diet of the decree of Vladislav (1525). The Brethren also
          sent a fruitless deputation to Erasmus, apparently in 1520. In
          the closing years of his life Lukas found himself obliged to
          break with the Habrovanites or Lultish Brethren in Moravia, who
          were closely associated with the "small" party, and rejected
          celibacy, spiritual and temporal authority, and the taking of
          oaths, in addition to following Carlstadt in the doctrine of the
          Lord's Supper, and wishing to substitute baptism of the spirit
          for baptism by water. After a fruitless conference, letters were
          exchanged with considerable frequency for a number of years,
          while an effort made by the Anabaptists who had emigrated from
          the Tyrol to Moravia to unite with the Brethren ended in 1528 in
          a complete schism. Lukas died at Jungbunzlau on Dec. 11, 1528,
          and was buried in the local house of the Brethren, which had
          formerly been a monastery. The organization, however, which he
          had given the Unity remained unchanged until its end.

    3. Later Organization.

          In principle the supreme judicial power was lodged with the
          synod, which consisted of all the clergy, although it contained
          no delegates chosen from the communities. It was, at the same
          time, the supreme court of appeal, although the chief
          administrative body, the "Close Council" (úzká rada), which was
          composed of some ten members chosen by the synod for life,
          apparently constituted the real government. The legal relation
          of the "Close Council" to the synod seems never to have been
          accurately defined. At the Synod of 1497 the "Close Council" was
          treated with all submission and obedience, and was empowered to
          make whatever changes and ordinances it deemed best without
          awaiting a decision of the synod. According to tradition, it
          never abused its privileges, and held a general council yearly
          whenever this was possible, while other synods also existed in
          individual districts. The presiding officer of the "Close
          Council" was called a "judge" (sudí), and this office was
          originally united with that of bishop in the person of Matthias,
          although he proved himself unequal to the position in the strife
          with the "small" party, so that Procopius was appointed sudí,
          Matthias retaining only the episcopal power of ordination.
          Authorized by the "Close Council," he associated Thomas and
          Elias, whom be had already ordained priests, and after the death
          of Matthias and the resignation of Procopius in 1500, the power
          of direction and ordination was again united, and given to four
          newly chosen Brethren, Thomas, Elias, Lukas, and Ambrose, the
          first two already possessing the episcopal ordination and the
          last two now receiving it. Each of them was placed over a
          diocese which he controlled and in which he ordained the
          priests. The priest next in age to these four was called the
          judge, and had special functions. Jafet, writing in 1605, sought
          to show that this organization existed from the first and that
          four bishops had ruled simultaneously since 1467, and this
          erroneous view was so widely disseminated by Wengierski
          (Regenvolscius) that it is still found sporadically. At the head
          of each community stood the priest or director (správce), who
          lived in the "house of the Brethren" and supported himself as an
          artisan or farmer. He might possess property, although he was
          bound by certain restrictions, so that when, for example, he
          received a legacy, he was required to deposit it with the "Close
          Council," which deprived him of it in case of need or inability
          to discharge his office. While there was no insistence on the
          celibacy of the clergy, it was regarded as desirable, in view of
          the unsettled position of the community, and was the rule until
          the second half of the sixteenth century. With the priest lived
          his assistant or deacon, who aided him both in his daily toil
          and in teaching school, and especially in the instruction of the
          acolytes (young men in training for the priesthood), who resided
          in the "house of the Brethren." The deacon accompanied the
          priest in all his pastoral journeys, and was permitted to
          preach, to baptize in case of need, and to aid in the Lord's
          Supper, although he could neither consecrate the elements nor
          pronounce the benediction at the close of the service of the
          community. A council of the community aided, and in part
          supervised, the priest in controlling the property of the
          congregation and in distributing alms. The income consisted, in
          addition to gifts and foundations, of two collections, taken at
          Christmas and St. John's Day. Three persons were deputed to
          oversee the giving of alms, while the council of the community
          was required to reconcile antagonistic members of the
          congregation with each other or with the priest, to control
          morals, and to maintain the discipline of the church. The bodies
          next in rank were the "Close Council" and the synods. The
          council of the community found its counterpart in a committee of
          aged widows and spinsters appointed to supervise the morals and
          the conduct of the sisters. This organization, the genesis of
          which is known chiefly from the Dekrety, remained unchanged
          after Lukas. It was first described in full detail by Lasicius
          in the eighth book of his history of the Brethren, and was
          officially formulated by them at the General Synod of ?eravic in
          Moravia, held in 1616.

  III. Development from 1528 to 1621.

    1. Johann Agusta.

          The independent development of the Unitas Fratrum closed with
          the death of Lukas. The Lutheran party among the Brethren,
          headed by such men as Johann Horn (Roh), Michael Weisse, Johann
          Augusta, and Mach Sionsky, now became more prominent and assumed
          the leadership. After the brief administration of the
          insignificant Martin Skoda, Horn became judge in 1532, but was
          surpassed in importance by his colleague Johann Augusta, a man
          characterized by meager education, yet of great firmness,
          energy, and eloquence, and deeply impressed with a sense of the
          peculiar advantages of the community. He sought to associate the
          Brethren with the foreign Evangelicals, and found a favorable
          opportunity shortly after 1530, when the margrave George of
          Brandenburg requested Conrad of Krajek to instruct him in the
          doctrines of his sect. A confession was prepared, and Luther was
          induced to have it painted at Wittenberg with a eulogistic
          preface. At the same time, however, Augusta made overtures to
          the Strasburg theologians, and Matthias ?ervenka, his envoy to
          Butzer, unexpectedly met Calvin. On the other hand, his
          relations with the Utraquistic Church of Bohemia were strained,
          especially during the administration of Mistopol. Another trait
          which characterizes the history of the Brethren after Lukas
          (1528-47) is the prominence of their nobility. The country
          estates were required to take part in the country diets just as
          the estates of the kingdom shared in the royal diets, and it
          thus became necessary for the estates of the Brethren to enter
          the former to defend the existence of their ecclesiastical
          union. In 1535, therefore, they gave King Ferdinand the creed of
          the Brethren, signed by all members of the nobility among them,
          twelve lords and thirty-five knights. Since ten of the
          twenty-six nobles tried by Ferdinand after the suppression of
          the so-called Bohemian revolt in 1547 were members of the Unity,
          he found a long-desired pretext to crush the community so far as
          possible. The decree of Vladislav was reenforced, certain
          estates which had been the centers of the brotherhood were
          confiscated by the king, and the former protectors of the
          Brethren were no longer able to evade the execution of the
          decree under the existing circumstances. The community was
          practically destroyed in Bohemia. Its seat of government was
          transferred to Moravia, but the majority of the Brethren were
          banished from the entire kingdom. Augusta himself was betrayed
          to Ferdinand, and regained his freedom only after repeated
          tortures and an imprisonment of sixteen years.

    2. Cessation of Persecution.

          The sixth decade of the century ushered in a period of
          comparative peace for the Brethren, and they now sought, under
          the leadership of Johann Blahoslav, to gain state recognition of
          their Church, their chances seeming especially favorable in view
          of the supposed Protestant tendency of Maximilian. In 1555 and
          the following years they accordingly endeavored to win the favor
          of the archduke through repeated conferences between Blahoslav
          and Maximilian's court preacher, Pfauser of Vienna, but their
          efforts to secure definite promises for the future bore little
          fruit. The same object was pursued by Utraquism, which had now
          become essentially Lutheran, and which had prepared a new creed
          for the Lutheran Church in Bohemia in 1575, after the compacts
          had been annulled by the diet of deputies in 1567 as antiquated.
          Through their representatives the Brethren sought to have their
          independence clearly expressed in the preface of the new creed,
          but their chance of recognition by the side of the
          "Neo-Utraquists" steadily decreased, while their essential
          community of interest with the new body became more and more
          clear. In 1609, when the estates forced Rudolf to issue his
          charter, the Brethren shared the religious liberty which it
          granted by joining in the Bohemian Confession of 1575, after
          having already given a full explanation of its acceptance in the
          previous year.

    3. The Brethren Merged in the Utraquists.

          All special names were now to cease, and the members of the
          united Bohemian Evangelical Church were henceforth to be called
          "Utraquistic Christians." The Brethren were represented in the
          common consistory, but despite the abolition of a separate name,
          this was, strictly speaking, not a union, but rather a
          confederation between the Unitas Fratrum and the Bohemian
          Church. The Brethren, therefore, retained their own organization
          and regulations, and even their independent creed (1564), while
          the Bohemian Lutherans, in like manner, held to the Augsburg
          Confession, although both creeds are declared to be in full
          harmony with the Bohemian Confession of 1575. Definitive form
          was accordingly given the church discipline of the Brethren at
          the Synod of ?eravic in 1616 under the title Ratio disciplinæ
          ordinisque ecclesiastici in unitate fratrum Bohemorum, but the
          plan of making this valid for the whole Bohemian Church was not
          realized. This organization, however, had but a brief period of
          prosperity, for the battle at the White Hill (Nov. 8, 1620)
          destroyed Protestantism in Bohemia and Moravia for more than a
          century and a half.

  IV. The Brethren in Prussia and Poland:

          The Brethren expelled from Bohemia in 1547 in consequence of the
          Schmalkald War emigrated partly to Moravia and partly to
          Prussia, where they were received by Duke Albert. After his
          death in 1568 they returned to Moravia and Poland, exercising an
          important influence on the introduction of the Reformation in
          the latter country, and attempting to establish friendly
          relations between the various Evangelical bodies at a synod held
          at Sendomir in 1570. Their scanty remnants still exist in the
          five so-called communities of Unity in the Prussian province of
          Posen: Posen, Lissa, Lasswitz, Waschke, and Orzeszkowo.

          Magdalen Colleges, Cambridge, was elected fellow of the former
          in 1580, and was Greek lecturer 1584-1595; became rector of
          Boxworth (5 m. n.w. of Cambridge) 1596, and prebendary of Ely
          1615. He was one of the translators of the Authorized Version,
          belonging to the Apocrypha company, and when his own part was
          done is said to have assisted the other Cambridge company on the
          section from Chronicles to Canticles; he was one of the
          delegates engaged in the final revision. He assisted Sir Henry
          Savile (who calls him "most ingenious and most learned") in his
          edition of Chrysostom (8 vols., Eton, 1612 [1610-13]), and left
          many manuscripts, but his only published work was Veteris
          interpretis cum Beza aliisque recentioribus collatio in quattuor

   Bolivia
          BOLIVIA: A republic of western South America, bounded on the
          north and east by Brazil; on the south by Paraguay and
          Argentina; and on the west by Chile and Peru. The area is
          estimated at from 520,000 to 600,000 square miles, the
          population from 1,900,000 to 2,500,000, of whom 1,250,000 are
          Indians and over 500,000 half-breeds. The constitution adopted
          in 1826 after independence had been attained recognized Roman
          Catholicism as the state religion and prohibited the public
          exercise of any other form of faith, toleration existing only in
          new colonies. Nevertheless, the properties of the Church were
          confiscated and sold, only the bishops being allowed a moderate
          annual sum. Complete religious liberty was granted by the
          government in 1905.

          In its hierarchical organization, Bolivia forms the province of
          La Plata, under the archbishop of La Plata (Chuquisaca de la
          Plata) or Sucre (diocese since 1551; archdiocese since 1609 with
          135 parishes). The suffragan bishoprics are those of Cochabamba,
          La Paz, and Santa Cruz de la Sierra. Cochabamba, founded in
          1847, has fifty-six parishes; La Paz, founded 1608, has
          thirty-eight; and Santa Cruz, founded 1605, fifty-four. In
          addition to the secular clergy, members of orders, including the
          Jesuits, are actively engaged in missionary labors among the
          Indians, of whom some 200,000 still cling to their pagan faith.
          The schools among the converted Indians are under religious
          control. There are four seminaries for the clergy, six
          "universities," and sixteen higher schools.

          The inaccessibility of Bolivia renders immigration, especially
          from Europe and North America, scanty. The number of Protestants
          in the country is accordingly small. There is a Presbyterian
          chapel in Sucre. Canadian Baptists have been engaged in
          missionary work in the country since 1898 and have organized
          churches at Oruro, La Paz, and Cochabamba. More recently the
          Methodist Episcopal Church of the United States has entered the
          field with headquarters at La Paz. An interdenominational
          mission is being conducted at Cochabamba by Australians. The
          educational system is being reorganized under the direction of
          an American missionary.

   Bolland, Jan, and the Bollandists
          BOLLAND, JAN, AND THE BOLLANDISTS: The founder of the monumental
          hagiographical work known as the Acta Sanctorum Bollondistarum
          (see [449]Acta Martyrum, [450]Acta Sanctorum), and his
          associates. Bolland was born at Julemont, near Liége, Aug. 13,
          1596; d. at Antwerp Sept. 12, 1665. He entered the Jesuit order
          in 1612, was ordained priest before 1625, and in 1630 was sent
          to Antwerp, where he began what was to prove his lifework,
          making use of the mass of accumulated material left by
          [451]Héribert Rosweyde, the originator of the idea, but largely
          extending the space contemplated by him. After working for
          thirteen years on the two volumes of January, he called to his
          aid two other Jesuits, [452]Gottfried Henschen and [453]Daniel
          Papebroch, who visited numerous libraries of Germany, Spain, and
          Italy in quest of material, and laid the foundation of the
          magnificent collection of 120,000 volumes which the Bollandists
          now possess. The first volume appeared at Antwerp in 1643, and
          the work went on without interruption until the suppression of
          the Jesuits in 1773. Their house at Antwerp was to be turned
          into a military school, and there seemed little prospect of
          continuing their task until in 1776 the empress Maria Theresa
          made arrangements to help them, and two years later assigned
          them the Caudenberg monastery in Brussels as a home. Here they
          labored on as a company of secular priests until Joseph II
          interfered arbitrarily with their plans and finally, in 1788,
          forbade them to continue the publication, as a mere collection
          of old documents which could have but little interest for
          educated men. In the following year the Premonstratensians of
          the abbey of Tangerlo in Brabant offered to buy their library
          and continue the work. The sixth volume of October appeared
          there in 1794; but in 1796 the French Republic took possession
          of Belgium and dissolved the abbey; the manuscripts, however,
          were preserved in the Royal Library at Brussels. Though both
          Napoleon and the French Academy desired the continuation of the
          work, it was not found possible until 1837, when, under the
          inspiration of De Ram, rector of the University of Louvain, the
          Belgian Jesuits once more took it up, with the promise of an
          annual subsidy of 6,000 francs from the government. The editors
          are now at work on the month of November, and at the present
          rate of progress, it is hoped that the end of the twentieth
          century may see the completion of the gigantic work. The present
          Bollandists are also publishing (since 1882) an annual volume of
          Analecta Bollandiana, containing additional Latin, Greek, and
          Syriac texts, new dissertations, and corrections to the earlier
          part of the work; and since 1890 they have also published a
          Bulletin de publications hagiographiques, a review of all new
          books bearing on the subject. They have published, in addition,
          two complete bibliographies (Greek, 1 vol., Latin, 2 vols.) of
          all the printed texts and other works on hagiography.

   Bolsec, Jérôme Hermès
          BOLSEC, JÉRÔME HERMÈS: French controversialist and physician; b.
          at Paris in the early part of the sixteenth century; d. probably
          at Lyons 1584. He entered the Carmelite order, but was driven
          from Paris for the boldness of his sermons and fled to Ferrara.
          In 1550 he was physician to M. de Falais, a nobleman residing
          near Geneva, who was a friend of Calvin. Bolsec was fond of
          dabbling in dogmatics, but was repeatedly admonished by the
          compagnie des pasteurs that his objections to the doctrine of
          predestination were contrary to the Bible. He seemed to submit,
          but on Oct. 16, 1551, he provoked a new discussion at Geneva on
          the same subject and was imprisoned, whereupon he charged Calvin
          with ignorance of the Bible and of teaching contrary to it, and
          the council, in their perplexity, accepted the proposition of
          the clergy to ask the advice of the Swiss churches. Their
          condemnation of Bolsec was mild, but the clergy of Basel
          declared that Bolsec was heretical in many respects, while the
          pastors of Neuchâtel declared that he was an instrument of
          Satan. On Dec. 22 he was sentenced to perpetual banishment for
          publishing offensive doctrines, as well as for slandering the
          clergy and charging them with preaching false dogmas. He was
          expelled from Thonon (Chablais) by Calvin, and from Lausanne by
          Beza, after having again accused the former of "making God the
          author of sin." He then returned to France and abjured
          Protestantism. He was the author of three works: Le Miroir,
          envoyé de Vérité au Roi Charles neufième (1562), addressed to
          the king to bring about a reformation; Histoire de la vie,
          moeurs, actes, doctrine, constance et mort de Jean Calvin, jadis
          ministre de Genève (Lyons, 1577), which made the author
          infamous; and Histoire de la vie, moeurs, doctrine et
          déportemens de Th. de Bèze, dit le Spectable, grand ministre de
          Genève (Paris, 1582), written in a tone of moderation. The
          entire life of Bolsec shows him to have been a restless, vain
          spirit, not overscrupulous in getting revenge or in winning
          patrons.

          EugÈne Choisy.

          Bolsec may easily be represented in a more favorable light as an
          honest opponent of Calvinistic dogma, and an advocate of liberty
          of conscience and freedom of speech. Persecution (defamation,
          repeated imprisonment, banishment from Geneva and from other
          places where he attempted to settle by the persistent efforts of
          Calvin, Beza, and others) embittered his spirit and no doubt led
          to exaggerated representations of the tyranny and cruelty of his
          opponents, and at last drove him back to the Roman Catholic
          Church.

   Bolsena, Miracle of
          BOLSENA, MIRACLE OF: A miracle which, according to an account
          strongly affirmed in local tradition, occurred in 1264 in the
          town of Bolsena (the ancient Vulsinius; 7 m. s.w. of Orvieto) in
          Umbria, Italy. The details of the story vary in different
          accounts, but the substance of the occurrence is as follows: A
          priest, who had been long troubled with doubts as to the real
          presence of Christ in the Eucharist, accidentally let fall upon
          the linen corporal, while saying mass, some drops from the
          consecrated chalice. While endeavoring to conceal this mishap,
          he was amazed to perceive that the stain was no longer as of
          wine but resembled fresh blood, and had not the irregular trace
          of a few spilled drops, but the form and contour of the
          consecrated boat or wafer. The miracle produced a great
          sensation throughout the surrounding country. Pope Urban IV, at
          that time staying in Orvieto with the pontifical court, caused
          the stained corporal to be brought to the city, where it has
          ever since been carefully preserved. This miracle was the
          determining reason which caused Urban to make general the
          celebration of the feast of [454]Corpus Christi. The composition
          of the liturgical office of the feast was entrusted to Thomas
          Aquinas, but in it there is no allusion to the miracle.

          The miracle of Bolsena has been immortalized by the genius of
          Raffael, who made it the subject of one of his frescoes in the
          second sala of the Vatican. The painting idealizes the scene and
          introduces, not Urban IV but Julius II, under whose pontificate
          the fresco was executed, as present at the mass. The present
          cathedral church of Orvieto was built on the site of an earlier
          structure to commemorate the miracle, and much of the elaborate
          decoration refers to it. The corporal is preserved in a silver
          shrine enriched with many figures in relief and subjects in
          translucent colored enamels. The shrine was begun by Ugolino
          Veri of Sienna in 1338 and is one of the most important
          specimens of medieval silversmith work in Italy. The feast of
          Corpus Christi is celebrated with extraordinary solemnity each
          year in Orvieto and the corporal is carried in procession
          through the town together with the Blessed Sacrament.

   Bolzano, Bernhard
          BOLZANO, bel-ts??´nO, BERNHARD: German Roman Catholic
          theologian, and noted mathematician; b. at Prague Oct. 5, 1781;
          d. there Dec. 18, 1848. He took orders and was made professor of
          the philosophy of religion in Prague 1805. He was soon suspected
          of heterodoxy, was accused at Rome by the Jesuits, and in 1820,
          on a charge of connection with certain student societies, was
          compelled to resign his professorship; he was also suspended
          from his priestly functions. Thenceforth he devoted himself to
          study and literary work. He sought to reconcile the teachings of
          the Church with reason and, it was said, considered the
          reasonableness of a doctrine of more importance than its
          traditional belief. In philosophy he was influenced by Leibnitz
          and Kant. His contributions to mathematical science were
          original and important. His works were numerous; the most
          noteworthy are Lehrbuch der Religionswissenschaft (4 vols.,
          Sulzbach, 1834), a philosophic presentation of the dogmas of
          Roman Catholic theology; Wissenschaftslehre; Versuch einer neuen
          Darstellung der Logik (4 vols., 1837).

   Bomberger, John Henry Augustus
          BOMBERGER, JOHN HENRY AUGUSTUS: Reformed (German); b. at
          Lancaster, Penn., Jan. 13, 1817; d. at Collegeville, Penn., Aug.
          19, 1890. He was graduated at Marshall College, 1837, and at the
          Theological Seminary, Mercersburg, Penn., 1838; served as pastor
          of German Reformed Churches in Pennsylvania till 1870, when he
          became president of Ursinus College at Collegeville. He began a
          condensed translation of the first edition of Herzog's
          Realencyklopädie of which two volumes were published
          (Philadelphia, 1856-60), embracing vols. i-vi of the original;
          he issued a revised translation of Kurtz's Text-book of Church
          History (Philadelphia, 1860), and edited The Reformed Church
          Monthly (in opposition to the "Mercersburg theology"), 1868-77.
          He also published Infant Salvation in its Relation to Infant
          Depravity, Infant Regeneration, and Infant Baptism (1859); Five
          Years at the Race Street Church [Philadelphia], with an
          ecclesiastical appendix (1860); The Revised Liturgy, a history
          and criticism of the ritualistic movement in the German Reformed
          Church (1867); Reformed, not Ritualistic: a reply to Dr. Nevin's
          "Vindication" (1867).

   Bona, Giovanni
          BONA, GIOVANNI: Roman Catholic theological writer; b. at Mondovi
          (55 m. w. of Genoa), Piedmont, Oct. 19, 1609; d. in Rome Oct.
          28, 1674. He came of an old French family, and in his fifteenth
          year entered the Italian congregation of reformed Cistercians,
          becoming later prior, abbot, and general. Clement IX made him a
          cardinal in 1669, and he acquired a great reputation for both
          piety and learning. His most important writings are ascetical
          and liturgical. To the latter class belong his Psallentis
          ecclesiæ harmonia (Rome, 1653), a historical, symbolic, and
          ascetic treatise on the psalmody of the Church, and the still
          better known Rerum liturgicarum libri ii (Rome, 1671), a sober
          and learned investigation of liturgical antiquities. The first
          complete edition of his works appeared at Antwerp, 1677,
          followed by several others.

   Bonald, Louis Gabriel Ambroise, Vicomte de
          BONALD, LOUIS GABRIEL AMBROISE, VICOMTE DE: French political and
          philosophical writer; b. at Monna, near Millau (130 m. w.n.w. of
          Marseilles), Aveyron, Oct. 2, 1754; d. there Nov. 23, 1840. He
          emigrated in 1791 and settled at Heidelberg; returned to France
          in 1797, lived in concealment for a time, and then was allowed
          to proceed to his estates; in 1808 he was appointed councilor of
          the Imperial University, and, after the Restoration, member of
          the Council of Public Instruction; from 1815 to 1822 he was
          member of the chamber of deputies, in 1822 minister of state,
          and in 1823 was made a peer of France; after 1830 he retired to
          private life. He was one of the leaders of the reactionary
          school to which belonged De Maistre, d'Eckstein, Ballanche,
          Lamennais, and others, which started with the principle that
          revelation and not observation is the true ground of philosophy;
          absolutism in politics and ecclesiastical despotism in religion
          were in his view the natural and desirable order of things. The
          most noteworthy of his many writings were Théorie du pouvoir
          politique et religieux (3 vols., Constance, 1796); La
          Législation primitive (3 vols., Paris, 1802); Recherches
          philosophiques sur les premiers objets des connaissances morales
          (2 vols., 1818). His collected works were published in twelve
          volumes in 1817-19 and again in three volumes in 1859. His
          second son, Louis Jacques Maurice, b. at Millau Oct. 30, 1787,
          d. at Lyons Feb. 25, 1870, became bishop of Puy in 1823,
          archbishop of Lyons in 1839, cardinal in 1841; he was a strong
          Ultramontane.

   Bonar, Andrew Alexander
          BONAR, ANDREW ALEXANDER: Free Church of Scotland; b. at
          Edinburgh May 29, 1810, youngest brother of [455]Horatius Boner;
          d. in Glasgow Dec. 30, 1892. He studied at Edinburgh; was
          minister at Collate, Perthshire, 1838-56, of the Finnieston
          Church, Glasgow, 1856 till his death. He joined the Free Church
          in 1843, and was its moderator in 1878. He was identified with
          evangelical and revival movements and adhered to the doctrine of
          premillenialism. With the Rev. R. M. McCheyne he visited
          Palestine in 1839 to inquire into the condition of the Jews
          there, and published A Narrative of a Mission of Inquiry to the
          Jews from the Church of Scotland in 1839 (Edinburgh, 1842); he
          also published a Memoir of Mr. McCheyne (1845); a Commentary on
          Leviticus (1846); Redemption Drawing Nigh, a defence of
          Premillenialism (1847); Christ and his Church in the Book of
          Psalms (1859); edited Samuel Rutherford's Letters (1863); and
          wrote many tracts, pamphlets, and minor biographies.

          BONAR, HORATIUS: Free Church of Scotland; b. in Edinburgh Dec.
          19, 1808; d. there July 31, 1889. He studied at Edinburgh;
          became minister at Kelso 1837, at the Chalmers Memorial Church,
          Edinburgh, 1866; with his congregation he joined the Free Church
          in 1843. He was a premillenarian and expressed his views in
          books, such as Prophetical Landmarks (London, 1847), and in the
          Quarterly Journal of Prophecy, which he founded in 1849. He is
          best known for his poems and hymns which include "What a friend
          we have in Jesus," "I heard the voice of Jesus say," and others
          equally familiar. The best known collections of his verse are
          Hymns of Faith and Hope (3 vols., 1857-66); The Song of the New
          Creation and other pieces (1872); Hymns of the Nativity (1878);
          Songs of Love and Joy (1888); Until the Daybreak and other hymns
          left behind (1890). His prose publications, besides sermons,
          tracts etc., include The Night of Weeping, or words for the
          suffering family of God (1846); God's Way of Peace (1862); The
          White Fields of France: or the story of Mr. McAll's mission to
          the workingmen of Paris and Lyons (1879); Life and Work of G. T.
          Dodds (1884).

   Bonaventura
          BONAVENTURA (Giovanni di Fidanza, called Doctor Seraphicus):
          Theologian; b. at Bagnorea (50 m. n.n.w. of Rome) 1221; d. at
          Lyons July 15, 1274. He entered the order of St. Francis
          probably in 1238; went to Paris, 1242 or 1243, and studied under
          Alexander of Hales; lectured there on the "Sentences" of Peter
          Lombard and on the Holy Scriptures till the university suspended
          lectures in 1255; was chosen general of his order, 1257;
          cardinal bishop of Albano, 1273. His last public act was an
          impressive speech delivered before the Council of Lyons in May,
          1274, for the union of the Eastern and Western churches. He was
          canonized by Sixtus IV in 1482. In defense of his order, before
          he became its general, during the contest between the Sorbonne
          and the mendicant monks, he wrote his De paupertate Christi, in
          reply to William of St. Amour's De periculis novissimorum
          temporum (1256); by a somewhat forced and sophistical
          argumentation he represents voluntary poverty as an element of
          moral perfection. Of his general views on monastic life he has
          given an exposition in his Determinationes quæstionum circa
          regulam Francisci. In his administration he was mild yet firm.
          As a teacher and author he occupies one of the most prominent
          places in the history of medieval theology; not so much,
          however, on account of any strongly pronounced originality as on
          account of the comprehensiveness of his views, the ease and
          clearness of his reasoning, and a style in which still linger
          some traces of the great charm of his personality. His mystical
          and devotional writings--as, far instance, De septem itineribus
          æternitatis--are almost imitations of Hugo of St. Victor. His
          dialectical writings are more independent. His Breviloquium (ed.
          Da Vicenza, 2d ed., Freiburg, 1881) is one of the best
          expositions of Christian dogmatics produced during the Middle
          Ages.

          editions, of which the best are that by Peltier, 15 vols.,

          Montreal, from 1848 to 1860 and rector of the same church from
          1860 to 1878. He was likewise archdeacon of Montreal in 1870-72
          and dean in 1872-78. In the latter year he was consecrated
          archbishop of Montreal, and in 1901 was elected metropolitan of
          Canada, while in 1904 he became primate of all Canada. He was
          also president of the theological college of the diocese of
          Montreal.

          BONET-MAURY, AMY GASTON CHARLES AUGUSTE: French Protestant; b.
          at Paris Jan. 2, 1842. He was educated at the Lycée Napoléon
          (now Collège Henri IV), the Sorbonne (baccalauréat ès lettres,
          1860) and the universities of Geneva and Strasburg (1868). He
          was successively pastor of the Walloon Reformed Church at Dort
          in 1868-72 and of the French Reformed Church at Beauvais (Oise)
          in 1872-79. In 1879 he became professor of church history in the
          faculty of Protestant theology of the University of Paris, and
          now holds the same position in the Independent Divinity School
          of Paris. From 1885 to 1889 he was librarian of the Musée
          Pédagogique. In theology he is a liberal evangelical. He wrote:

   Boniface
          BONIFACE: The name of nine popes.

          Boniface I: Pope 418-422. After the death of Zosimus, a part of
          the clergy and people chose the archdeacon Eulalius to succeed
          him (Dec. 27, 418); he was recognized by the prefect Symmachus
          and consecrated in the Lateran two days later. But another
          faction held an election on the 28th, and chose Boniface, the
          son of the priest Jocundus, consecrating him on the following
          day. In accordance with the report of Symmachus, the emperor
          Honorius recognized Eulalius, and Boniface had to leave Rome.
          His supporters appealed to the emperor, representing him as the
          choice of the majority. Honorius called a council to meet at
          Ravenna, Feb. 8, 419, to decide the matter, but it reached no
          conclusion, and another was summoned for May 1, both candidates
          being forbidden to enter Rome in the mean time. Eulalius,
          however, entered the city or Mar. 18, and had to be removed
          forcibly; and Honorius now recognized Boniface, who took up his
          duties on Apr. 10. This contest caused Honorius to decree that
          in any subsequent case of a contested election, both candidates
          should be set aside and a new choice made.

          When Boniface I intervened in any ecclesiastical disputes, he
          showed great justice and moderation. The clergy of Valence
          accused their bishop Maximus of grievous crimes; Boniface
          referred the matter to a Gallic synod, reserving to himself the
          right to review its decision. Considering the privilege granted
          by Pope Zosimus (417) to Bishop Patroclus of Arles, to
          consecrate bishops for the provinces known as Viennensis,
          Narbonensis prima, and Narbonensis secunda, to be an
          infringement of earlier canonical provisions, he did not
          hesitate to withdraw it so far as to allow the bishop of
          Narbonne this metropolitan privilege for the Provincia
          Narbonensia prima. He was involved in long-drawnout negotiations
          with the patriarch of Constantinople. Certain Illyrian bishops,
          wishing to bring charges against Bishop Perigenes of Patras, who
          had been chosen metropolitan of Corinth, getting satisfaction
          neither from the papal delegate for Illyria, Bishop Rufus of
          Thessalonica, nor from the pope himself, turned to Atticus of
          Constantinople for redress. The latter procured an edict from
          the emperor Theodosius II (421), placing Illyria under the
          jurisdiction of Constantinople. Boniface made strong
          representations to the Byzantine court (Mar., 422), but would
          probably not have been successful had not the influence of the
          Western emperor Honorius prevailed with Theodosius, who withdrew
          the edict. Finally, Boniface had inherited from his predecessor
          a difficult controversy with the African church (see
          [456]Zosimus); he had no better success than Zosimus in securing
          the recognition in Africa, of the right of appeal to Rome. On
          the contrary, the Synod of Carthage in 419 confirmed the
          seventeenth canon of the synod of 418, which positively forbade
          to priests and lower clergy any such appeals, and tolerated them
          for bishops only on condition that the prescription appealed to
          could be shown to be Nicene; as a matter of fact, it came from
          the Council of Sardica. Boniface died Sept. 4, 422, and is
          reckoned among the saints of the Roman Catholic Church.

          Boniface II: Pope 530-532. After the death of Felix IV (middle
          of Sept., 530), a contested election followed. The minority, in
          obedience to the dying charge of Felix, chose the archdeacon
          Boniface, a Goth; the majority elected Dioscurus, a Greek, and
          both were consecrated on the same day (Sept. 22). The Roman
          senate took cognizance of the matter, forbidding under heavy
          penalties any proceedings in the lifetime of a pope looking
          toward the elevation of a successor. The schism was soon ended
          by the death of Dioscurus, Oct. 14. The Liber pontificalis
          asserts that Boniface proceeded with great violence against his
          adherents; and we have evidence that five years later the
          bitterness caused by this was not extinct among the Roman
          clergy. The close of the Semi-Pelagian controversy falls in the
          pontificate of Boniface II. In a letter to Cæsarius of Arles he
          pronounced against the opinion that man could attain faith in
          Christ by his own resources, without the help of divine grace;
          and at the same time, in accordance with the wishes of Cæsarius,
          he confirmed the decisions of the Synod of Orange. He was always
          zealous in maintaining, if it was not possible to extend, the
          papal claims to jurisdiction. When Bishop Stephen of Larissa in
          Thessaly appealed to him from a sentence of deposition
          pronounced by the patriarch of Constantinople, Boniface
          endeavored to reassert the old rights of the Roman See over
          Illyria, which had been obsolete for a hundred years. The
          proceedings of a synod held in Rome for this purpose (Dec., 531)
          seem to have been fruitless, for soon afterward the see of
          Larissa was filled by a nominee of Constantinople. After
          attempting in vain to designate the deacon Vigilius as his
          successor, Boniface died in Oct., 532.

          Boniface III: Pope 607. He was a Roman by birth, previously a
          deacon and apocrisiarius at the court of Constantinople, to
          which he had been sent by Gregory the Great in 603. Apparently
          he was still there when the election took place, as nearly a
          year elapsed between the death of his predecessor and his
          consecration (Feb. 19, 607). As (in modern language) nuncio at
          Constantinople, he had apparently maintained friendly relations
          with the usurper Phocas, which would account for the favorable
          decision made by the latter on a point of great importance to
          the papal claims. One of the commissions given to him by Gregory
          was the settlement of the strife over the title of "universal
          bishop" claimed by the patriarch of Constantinople, John the
          Faster; Gregory did not claim it for himself, but he was
          unwilling that it should be borne by another. The Liber
          pontificalis, Paulus Diaconus, and Bede all assert that Phocas
          recognized Rome as caput omnium ecclesiarum. Though the fact is
          not denied, it is to be regarded rather as a triumph of papal
          politics, which did not disdain the alliance of a base and
          criminal ruler, than as a historical justification of the claims
          of Rome. Boniface died Nov. 12, 607.

          Boniface IV: Pope 608-615. He was the successor of Boniface III
          after an interregnum of ten months. He kept up the same friendly
          relations with Phocas, from whom he acquired the Pantheon in
          Rome, built as a heathen temple, and transformed it into a
          church. When Heraclius, who overthrew Phocas in 610, was
          endeavoring to find a way to reconciliation with the
          Monophysites, Boniface seems to have approved of his plans;
          which probably accounts for a letter of [457]Columban written
          from Bobbio (c. 613), informing him that people call him a
          receiver and protector of heretics who deny the double nature of
          Christ, and warning him that his power will remain only so long
          as he maintains the true faith. Boniface died May 25, 615.

          Boniface V: Pope 619-625. The Liber pontificalis tells that he
          was a Neapolitan, that he distinguished himself as pope by his
          love of peace and kindness, and that he issued a number of
          decrees affecting the functions of the different orders of the
          clergy. Bede and William of Malmesbury mention several letters
          addressed to English personages; the most important is that
          preserved by the latter, a letter to Justus, archbishop of
          Canterbury (625); confirming for all time the position of his
          diocese as the metropolitan see of Britain, and extending his
          powers. Boniface died Oct. 25, 625.

          Boniface VI: Pope 896. He was the son of Hadrian, a Roman, and
          was elevated to the papal throne in April or May, 896, by a
          popular movement, on the death of Formosus, although he had
          twice been deposed from his spiritual functions by John VIII on
          charges affecting his moral character, and apparently was never
          canonically restored. He maintained his position only for
          fifteen days, as the party hostile to Formosus carried through
          the election of Stephen VI, who drove him out. Others say that
          he died fifteen days after his election.

          Boniface VII: Pope 974, 984-985. After the downfall of Benedict
          VI, Crescentius, the leader of the nobles, caused the election
          of the deacon Boniface, called Franco (June, 974). One of his
          first acts was to order his predecessor to be put to death. But
          he was able to hold his own only for six weeks, after which he
          fled to Constantinople. Here he remained for more than nine
          years--or as long as Otto II lived to protect the popes set up
          by him, Benedict VII and John XIV. Otto died Dec. 7, 983, and
          the fugitive Boniface immediately asserted his claims. He
          reappeared in Rome, and in the following April defeated John
          XIV, imprisoned him in the castle of Sant'Angelo, and had him
          either poisoned or starved to death there. Eleven months later,
          this "horrible monster" (as a contemporary calls him) met a like
          fate, dying, it seems probable, by assassination in the summer
          of 985; his body was mutilated and insulted by the infuriated
          populace. Gfrörer's hypothesis that his murder was caused by the
          empress Theophano has no support in the original authorities.

          Boniface VIII (Benedetto Gaetani):

    Policy and Successes in Italy.

          Pope 1294-1303. He was born at Anagni [c. 1235], and probably
          studied civil and canon law at Paris. He began his
          ecclesiastical career as canon of Todi, held benefices in Lyons
          and Rome, and became notary of the Curia. Martin IV made him a
          cardinal in 1281, and under Nicholas IV and Celestine V he was
          one of the most prominent members of the sacred college, being
          employed in the most varied missions. He encouraged Celestine V
          in his project of retirement to ascetic seclusion, and even drew
          up the formula of abdication, by which he was to profit; for,
          less than a fortnight after Celestine had laid down the papal
          dignity, it was bestowed upon his adviser (Dec. 24, 1294). Even
          before his consecration, the new pope asserted his prerogatives
          by revoking many appointments of his two predecessors, deposing
          archbishops and bishops appointed by Celestine without the
          consent of the cardinals, and leaving Naples for Rome with all
          his court, in spite of the efforts of Charles II to detain him
          there. He was consecrated and crowned in St. Peter's, Jan. 23,
          1295, and soon took an active part in the conflicts of the time,
          offering to mediate between Genoa and Venice in February. Sicily
          occupied him next; it had freed itself from French domination in
          1282, chosen Peter III of Aragon as king, and thus dissolved the
          feudal connection with Rome. Peter's son and heir, James II,
          showed himself ready to abandon Sicily after Aragon had fallen
          to him by the death of his elder brother. Another brother,
          however--Frederick--stepped in and assumed the Sicilian crown,
          and neither repeated papal anathemas nor an armed league against
          him could make him renounce it; in 1302 he obtained favorable
          terms of peace, and in 1303 papal recognition. Boniface also
          intervened in the strife between the Blacks and Whites of
          Florence, in favor of the former, and sent a legate to Tuscany.
          From the sojourn of Dante in Rome as the ambassador of the
          Bianchi dates the bitter hatred which he displays for Boniface
          VIII. In agreement with the Neri, Boniface brought Charles of
          Valois to Tuscany in 1301 as governor; but his five months' rule
          accomplished nothing but the alienation of the last sympathizers
          of the pope there. Boniface had real power only in the south of
          Italy and some central cities. Charles II of Naples became the
          obedient servant of the Curia, while Pisa, Velletri, Orvieto,
          and Terracina chose Boniface as their ruler. But a hostile party
          was forming in Rome, led by the two Colonna, cardinals, who
          disapproved of the close alliance with Charles II and secretly
          supported the pretensions of the house of Aragon in Sicily. In
          1297 the pope stripped them of all their ecclesiastical
          dignities; and on the same day they formally renounced their
          allegiance to him, declaring Celestine's abdication to have been
          invalid and appealing to a general council. Boniface deprived
          the whole family of their possessions, one after another, and
          soon Palestrina alone held out against the papal army. The
          Colonna submitted in 1298; but when, the next year, Boniface
          destroyed Palestrina, contrary, they asserted, to a promise of
          ultimate restitution, they took up arms once more against him.
          Again they were defeated, and their estates divided between
          their enemies, the Orsini and the Gaetani.

    Denmark, Hungary, and Poland.

          Soon after his accession, Boniface became involved in
          complications beyond the boundaries of Italy. Eric VIII of
          Denmark had imprisoned the archbishop of Lund in 1294, really to
          extort money from him, but nominally on the ground of
          conspiracy. In 1295 Boniface sent a legate to demand his release
          on pain of excommunication and interdict. These penalties were
          imposed in 1296, but Eric held out until 1302, though even then
          the pope did not succeed in restoring the deposed archbishop. In
          the contest for the throne of Hungary, on the ground that he had
          been "set over princes and kingdoms, to put down iniquity," and
          that Hungary belonged on special grounds to the Apostolic See,
          he claimed the deciding voice; in 1300 he sent Charles Robert,
          grandson of Mary of Sicily, to the Hungarians as their king; but
          they first clung to Andrew III, and after his death elected the
          son of Wenceslaus II of Bohemia as Ladislaus V. At the moment of
          Boniface's death, Wenceslaus was preparing to unite with Philip
          the Fair against him, and his interests clashed with the pope's
          in another place as well--in Poland, which had elected
          Wenceslaus in 1300, to take the place of the deposed King
          Ladislaus. Again Boniface claimed suzerain rights, supported the
          exiled king, who had sought his aid, and forbade Wenceslaus to
          assume the crown without the papal sanction; but, as in Hungary,
          his words were not heeded.

    Germany.

          He met with somewhat greater success in Germany. The undertaking
          given by Adolf of Nassau, in the Treaty of Nuremberg (Aug. 21,
          1294), to support Edward I of England against Philip IV,
          displeased the pope, who wished to see peace between France and
          England. He wrote to Adolf forbidding him to take up arms, and
          reproaching him for not having announced his election to him.
          Adolf returned a submissive answer, and received some privileges
          in return, but the papal legates were bidden still to insist on
          peace. He even went so far as to impose a year's truce on all
          three kings (1295), which, at its expiration, he renewed for
          another two years. In 1296 he commanded them to submit their
          differences to his decision; but only Adolf sent his
          representatives to Rome. On June 27, 1298, Boniface decided that
          neither Philip nor Adolf must overstep his boundaries, and that
          these must be restored where they had been violated. Adolf never
          heard of this decision; four days before it was rendered, he had
          been deposed by the electoral princes, and on July 2 he fell in
          battle against his rival Albert of Austria. Boniface took a
          lofty tone with Albert, summoning him to appear within six
          months and submit his claims to the throne, since it belonged to
          the pope to examine the person chosen king of the Romans, and
          reject him if unsuitable. Albert delayed until he made his
          position secure in Germany, and then sent his ambassadors (Mar.,
          1302) with liberal promises and the required evidence. Boniface
          needed his help against France too badly to raise any objection,
          and recognized him as king of the Romans and future emperor.
          Albert, in return, renounced his alliance with Philip, and made
          all possible theoretical and practical concessions.

    England.

          But a more stubborn obstacle was found in the king and
          parliament of England. When Edward I had conquered Scotland for
          the second time in 1298, Boniface claimed that country also as a
          fief of the Holy See, and summoned Edward before his tribunal
          for having ventured to lay hands upon it. Edward laid the bull
          before Parliament in 1301; the reply of the English people was
          that Scotland had never been a papal fief, that their king
          should not answer the summons, and that, even if he wished to,
          they would not permit it. On May 7 Edward informed the pope that
          he would not give up Scotland; and Boniface was obliged to be
          content with the answer, because in the mean time the memorable
          conflict with France had broken out.

    France.

          Philip the Fair was a ruler after the very pattern of
          Macchiavelli's later description, knowing no law but
          self-interest, and sticking at nothing to accomplish his ends.
          His relations with Boniface had at first been friendly, but he
          was probably offended by the pope's above-mentioned interference
          with his designs against England. When in 1296 the clergy of
          both France and England complained to Boniface of the taxes laid
          upon them by their sovereigns for warlike purposes, he answered
          by the bull Clericis laicos (Feb. 25, 1296). It opened with the
          offensive assertion that the laity had always been and still
          were hostile to the clergy, and proceeded to forbid all princes
          to tax the clergy of their dominions without papal sanction,
          under pain of excommunication. Edward, though at first
          protesting, declared in 1297 that no further tax should be laid
          upon the clergy without their consent; but Philip responded by
          forbidding all exportation of gold and silver, coined or
          uncoined, from France (Aug., 1296). This cut off so large a
          portion of the papal revenue that Boniface modified his attitude
          in the bull Ineffabilis amoris (Sept. 25), and yielded more
          completely in three briefs (Feb. and July, 1297) extremely
          conciliatory in tone; in the same spirit he completed the
          canonization of Louis IX in August, and the discord seemed in a
          fair way to be removed. But it was not long in breaking out
          again. Philip had welcomed to his court some of the exiled
          Colonna family, and had lent a willing ear to their unmeasured
          abuse of the pope, which did not spare his moral character. The
          king's misuse of the droit de régale (see [458]Régale), on the
          other hand, had been giving increasing provocation to the pope
          since 1299. An open rupture came in 1301; and by that time both
          contestants had increased their pretensions and were ready to
          wage a more bitter war than ever. Boniface chose to send as
          legate to Paris a Frenchman, Bernard de Saisset, bishop of
          Pamiers, who was for several reasons persona non grata at the
          French court, and his haughty tone at this time made him no
          better liked. Philip refused to see him; and, then, when he had
          returned to Pamiers, brought him back to Paris, and had him
          tried and condemned on a charge of treason and lese-majesty. On
          Dec. 5, 1301, Boniface demanded that his ambassador should
          immediately be set free to come to Rome; and at the same time he
          summoned the principal French churchmen and jurists to assemble
          in Rome Nov. 1, 1302, to take counsel with him in the
          difficulties of the French question. Notifying Philip of this,
          amid the most passionate reproaches, in the bull Ausculta fili,
          he commanded him also to appear in person or by proxy at this
          assembly; the assertions were repeated that God had set the
          Vicar of Christ over princes and kingdoms, thus giving him
          charge to ordain what might be needed for the removal of
          scandals and for the welfare of the kingdom of France. To meet
          this, Philip summoned his estates to Paris for Apr. 10, 1302,
          and laid before them not the bull Ausculta fili, but a document
          purporting to be the pope's utterance, which far surpassed even
          the real one in matter of offense. The estates, stirred up by
          this, voted to stand by the king. Toward the end of the year,
          Philip notified the pope that he would have none of his
          arbitration in the struggle with England; and Boniface now urged
          Edward to war instead of peace. Peace, however, was made in
          1303. Meantime, as a result of the synod which the pope opened
          on Oct. 30, 1302, at which not a few French prelates were
          present in spite of Philip, the Bull Unam sanctum was drawn up,
          asserting in the most definite terms the theory of "the two
          swords," and the necessity to salvation of submission to the
          pope. Some futile attempts at conciliation took place in the
          early part of 1303, but Philip was declared on Apr. 13 to have
          rendered himself liable to excommunication. Two months later,
          the king assembled his nobles, prelates, and jurists, and his
          answer came in the form of a definite accusation against
          Boniface under twenty-four separate heads of the most appalling
          nature. Impressed by this, the assembly resolved to appeal to a
          general council against him; but since he would have to be
          forced to attend it, the collection of funds for this purpose
          was begun. William of Nogaret, the king's vice-chancellor, went
          to Italy and struck up an alliance with Sciarra Colonna, who had
          the wrongs of his family to avenge. They enlisted a number of
          the nobles of the Campagna, and used money freely, winning
          adherents even among Boniface's fellow townsmen of Anagni, where
          he was then holding his court. He had resolved to make formal
          publication of the anathema against Philip on Sept. 8; but early
          on the morning of the 7th, William and his adherents, a few
          hundred strong, gained an entrance into the town, penetrated
          even into the sleeping apartments of Boniface, and when he
          refused all concessions made him a prisoner in his own palace.
          On the 9th the citizens rose and liberated him; Nogaret and
          Sciarra Colonna were forced to flee, while Boniface returned to
          Rome Sept. 25. But, worn out by the long strife, he died Oct.
          11.

    Character and Achievements of Boniface.

          His defeat is to be seen not in the circumstances of his
          captivity and his death, but in the fact that the spiritual
          weapons he wielded proved utterly unequal to the conquest of the
          aroused national feeling of France. The national spirit showed
          itself more powerful than the ecclesiastical. This defeat
          inflicted a staggering blow upon the authority of the papacy.
          Yet Boniface was no ordinary man. Though he was between seventy
          and eighty when he became pope, he showed no trace of the
          weakness of age; his will was unbending, his mind clear and
          logical. But his whole heart was set on power. In some ways he
          reminds of Gregory VII, and he could no more hope to escape
          conflicts than could the unflinching Hildebrand. But he did not
          in the conflict show the moral loftiness of Hildebrand--to say
          nothing of that of such men as Nicholas I and Innocent III. Nor
          is his personality without moral flaws. He had no scruple in
          using the funds he had raised for the recovery of the Holy Land
          in his own wars; nor is the reproach unfounded that he used the
          privileges of his position to surround his own family with
          princely splendor. When he strove for peace, as between England
          and France, his determining motive was plainly the desire to
          show himself the supreme arbiter of nations; when he had nothing
          to gain, he was ready enough to set them against each other, as
          he set Albert I and Edward I against Philip. Fair criticism
          must, however, reject the accusations of debauchery entirely,
          since they rest on no trustworthy testimony; and quite as
          groundless is the charge of heresy brought against him by his
          foes. Clement V had good foundation for the doubtful praise
          which he bestows upon Boniface when he calls him a destroyer of
          heretics; for he not only confirmed, but even strengthened the
          laws passed against heresy by Frederick II. He had a great
          influence on the development of the canon law by the issue in
          1298 of his so-called Liber sextus,--a continuation of the five
          books which Gregory IX had put together in 1234; it contains his
          own decrees as well as those of his predecessors since Gregory's
          time. It must be mentioned to his credit that he erected higher
          schools at Avignon and at Fermo in the March of Ancona, modeled
          after the University of Bologna, for the study of theology,
          civil and canon law, medicine, and the liberal arts; and he has
          a special title to the gratitude of Rome for the refounding of
          the Roman University, originally established by Charles of Anjou
          in 1265.

          Boniface IX (Pietro Tomacelli): Pope 1389-1404. He came of a
          noble Neapolitan family, and was made a cardinal by Urban VI,
          whom he succeeded Nov. 2, 1389. He is said to have been
          judicious, affable, and pious, but without learning or knowledge
          of affairs. His principal aim was the restoration of the papal
          authority in Rome and the States of the Church, for which he
          labored not unsuccessfully. The Romans, it is true, expelled him
          from the city in 1392, but fearful that he might fix his
          residence permanently elsewhere, they recalled him in the
          following year. He returned on condition of the surrender of a
          great part of the civic liberties; and another rising in 1398
          gave him the opportunity to limit them still further. He was
          fortunate also in regard to Naples, where things were in a
          condition very unfavorable to the papacy, owing to the confused
          policy of Urban VI. Clement VII and Louis II of Anjou thought
          the time had come to make a thorough conquest of the kingdom,
          but Boniface made a close alliance with King Ladislaus and
          finally gained a complete victory over the French, holding
          Naples in the Roman obedience. By the aid of his political
          influence, Boniface hoped to succeed in ending the great schism,
          at first depending on the German king Wenceslaus, whom he
          invited to Rome for coronation as emperor; but matters were in
          too critical a state in Germany for him to leave. An appeal to
          Charles VI of France in 1392 to abandon his allegiance to
          Clement had no good result; nor had a similar attempt in
          Castile. The hope of accommodation raised by the death of
          Clement VII (Sept. 16, 1394) was destroyed by the action of the
          Avignon cardinals, who elected Benedict XIII. In the contests
          resulting in the deposition of Wenceslaus and the attempt to put
          the count palatine Rupert in big place, Boniface wavered from
          side to aide, and only expressed his willingness to recognize
          Rupert in 1403 from a fear that he would be thrown into the arms
          of the king of France. Boniface acquired an unenviable
          reputation for avarice, nepotism, and simoniacal transactions.
          He died Oct. 1, 1404.

   Boniface, Saint
          BONIFACE, SAINT: The apostle of the Germans; b. at Crediton (8
          m. n.w. of Exeter), Devonshire, between 675 and 683; d. a martyr
          on the banks of the Borne near Dokkum (13 m. n.e. of
          Leeuwarden), in Friesland, June 5, 755. He was an Englishman of
          a distinguished family of Wessex, and was originally named
          Winfrid or Wynfrith. His studies were begun at the monastery of
          Adescancastre (Exeter?), and continued at Nutshalling or
          Nursling, near Winchester. Here he won distinction for learning
          and practical wisdom, and at an early age was made master of the
          monastic school.

    Early Missionary Work.

          Disregarding brilliant prospects at home, from 717 Boniface gave
          himself to missionary work on the Continent. After a brief
          effort in Friesland--the field of his countryman
          [459]Willibrord--he went to Rome and received a commission from
          the pope (Gregory II) as missionary to Central Germany. He began
          his labor in Thuringia and Hessia, the easternmost of the lands
          of the Franks, where he found not only heathen but Christians
          and priests who knew nothing and wanted to know nothing of Roman
          discipline and order. They were probably converts and disciples
          of Iro-Scottish and British monks, who had long been laboring
          among the tribes from the Rhine to the Saale and southward to
          the Alps (see [460]Celtic Church in Britain and Ireland, II, 2,
          § 3, [461]III, 2, § 2). For two or three years Boniface's
          activity was diverted to Friesland, but then he returned to the
          Franks, and, with the help of two landed proprietors, founded a
          central settlement for himself and companions at Amöneburg on
          the Ohm in Hessia. His success was great and led to a summons to
          Rome from Gregory II. There he was consecrated bishop and swore
          fidelity to the canons of the Church; he was charged to be on
          his guard against heretical priests and anti-Roman bishops.
          About 724 he returned to Germany, provided with letters of
          recommendation to the major domus, Charles Martel, to the
          clergy, chieftains, and people. Charles Martel granted him
          protection, and, after confirming recent converts in Hessia, and
          felling the sacred oak of Thor near Geismar, Boniface went
          eastward into Thuringia, and established its first monastery at
          Ohrdruf. He founded many churches, converted the heathen,
          expelled the anti-Roman priests, and in ten years had won a new
          province for the Church and the pope.

    Organization.

          Being promoted to the dignity of archbishop, Boniface organized
          his Church by founding the sees of Würzburg, Buraburg, and
          Erfurt, and by building monasteries and nunneries, which he
          filled with monks and nuns from England and endowed and improved
          with the help of English money. Bavaria next claimed his
          attention. Anti-Roman influence was strong there and among the
          neighboring [462]Alemanni, but, with the authorization of
          Gregory III, in a few years, Boniface placed men in sympathy
          with Rome in the sees of Regensburg, Passau, Salzburg, and
          Freising, and substituted the Benedictine rules for those of
          Columban in the monasteries. On the death of Charles Martel
          (741), his sons Karlman and Pepin, who had been brought up under
          monkish influence, succeeded to his power. In 742 Karlman called
          upon the papal legate to regulate the affairs of the Church for
          the East Franks. Under the guiding influence of Boniface two
          synods were held and measures were adopted concerning the
          monastic and scholastic discipline, the restoration of church
          estates which had been lost, the introduction of Roman marriage
          laws, celibacy of the clergy, the expulsion of the old British
          itinerant priests and bishops, the extirpation of remnants of
          heathenism, the establishment of the hierarchical order, and the
          like. There was some opposition from the nobles, certain of the
          bishops, and the people, who were attached to their old customs,
          but at court and in the Council the adversaries of the
          "reformation of the Church" lost all authority.

    Archbishop.

          In 744 Pepin followed the example of his brother. A synod was
          held at Soissons, and Boniface was given a free hand,
          notwithstanding resistance from the Frankish clergy. For a long
          time, however, he was unable to alienate the people from their
          old priests and bishops, such as [463]Adalbert and [464]Clement.
          A general Frankish synod in 745 published new agenda for both
          divisions of the country and promised Boniface the metropolitan
          see at Cologne. In 747 the Frankish bishops with Boniface at the
          head signed in due form a bill of submission in which they
          acknowledged the papal rights, laws, and power, and promised
          obedience and faithfulness. By this action the bond between the
          Frankish empire and Rome was sealed; the "Prince of the
          Apostles" was to be head and master in the countries north of
          the Alps. Pope Zacharias had every reason to be grateful to his
          legate. Instead of Cologne, Boniface received Mainz as his see.
          Here he was near his old mission field in Hessia and Thuringia,
          and from Mainz he could direct the building of his favorite
          foundation, the abbey of [465]Fulda. Worldly affairs now
          occupied him little. After the death of Willibrord he desired
          strongly to continue the Friesian mission. In 754 he spent some
          time in Friesland. The next year he again descended the Rhine
          with a large following and pitched his camp on the little river
          Borne, expecting the newly baptized would come thither for
          confirmation. But the camp was attacked by night by a band of
          heathen and Boniface and his entire company were massacred. He
          is buried at Fulda. An English synod shortly after his death
          proclaimed him patron of the English Church by the side of
          Gregory the Great and Augustine. Plus IX in 1875 ordered to
          invoke his name because of troubles in Germany and England. Many
          churches in Germany are dedicated to him. [A number of writings
          have been attributed to Boniface. Those most commonly regarded
          as genuine are letters, a collection of ecclesiastical statutes,
          a Latin poem called Ænigmata de virtutibus, and several shorter
          poems.]

   Bonifatius-Verein
          BONIFATIUS-VEREIN ("Boniface Society"): A Roman Catholic society
          of Germany, having as its object "to promote the spiritual
          interests of Catholics living in Protestant parts of Germany,
          and the maintenance of schools" (by-laws, § 1). The tendency
          toward freer relations between different confessions and
          shifting of confessional connections in Germany in the earlier
          years of the nineteenth century aroused the anxiety of the
          Church of Rome. According to a statement in the Ultramontane
          Münchener historisch-politische Blätter (lxviii, 45) the Roman
          Church lost between 1802 and 1870 more than 500,000 souls in
          South Germany, whereas the loss in North Germany between 1802
          and 1850 was estimated at one million. The "Francis Xavier
          Society," which had its headquarters at Lyons in France, and
          properly speaking was a missionary society, took care of the
          "missions" in Germany as far as possible; but until 1848 no
          Roman Catholic church or school could be established in Germany
          without the consent of the government. These restrictions were
          done away with in 1848, and when the third convention of Roman
          Catholics met at Regensburg, Oct. 4, 1849, at the suggestion of
          Döllinger, at that time an ardent champion of Rome, and of Count
          Josef von Stolberg, son of the famous convert Frederick Leopold
          von Stolberg, the Bonifatius-Verein was founded. Paderborn was
          chosen as the center of operation. Pius IX approved the society,
          Apr. 21, 1852, and Leo XIII favored the priests belonging to it
          with indulgences, Mar. 15, 1901. In Bavaria the society was not
          favorably received at first on account of similar societies
          already existing, and in North Germany it seemed to be a failure
          by 1853. But after 1857, owing to the exertions of Bishop Martin
          of Paderborn and of Alban Stolz, it progressed rapidly and in
          1899 celebrated the golden jubilee of its successful activity.

          The society obtains the means necessary for carrying on its work
          in various ways: (1) from collections in, the churches; (2) from
          private persons who obligate themselves to pay for a number of
          years the minister's salary in a certain congregation; (3) from
          donations to a permanent endowment fund; (4) from societies
          which collect seemingly worthless objects, as cigar ends, corks,
          and the like; the income from these societies, used particularly
          for orphan asylums and like institutions, amounted from 1885 to
          1891 to 1,490,539 marks; (5) from the profits of the Bonifatius
          printing-house and the Bonifatius second-hand book-stall at
          Paderborn; (6) from periodicals and pamphlets; (7) from
          academical Bonifatius societies, which built the Catholic church
          at Greifswald; (8) from societies of a like character, as the
          "Boniface Society of the Catholic Noblemen of Silesia," the
          "Boniface Society of Catholic Ladies for Church Vestments and
          Furniture," and others. The aggregate receipts from all these
          sources between 1849 and 1899 were 36,000,000 marks; and between
          1849 and 1901 more than 29,000,000 marks were expended for 2,240
          stations. In 1902 the revenues aggregated 442,000 marks, and
          expenditures 310,000 marks.

          The territory of the Bonifatius-Verein comprises Germany,
          Austria with Bosnia and Herzegovina, Switzerland, Denmark, and
          Luxembourg. In Germany special attention is paid to the
          Protestant parts of Prussia, above all Berlin; Saxony,
          Brunswick, and Mecklenburg are also regarded as missionary
          fields. In Bavaria, Nuremberg, formerly wholly Protestant, is
          especially an object of the propaganda in order to connect the
          northern and southern parts of Bavaria.

   Boni Homines
          BONI HOMINES: A name borne by several monastic brotherhoods,
          particularly by the Grammontensians (see [466]Grammont, Order
          of), the Fratres saccati, or [467]Sack Brethren, and an order of
          canons regular founded in Portugal by John Vicenza (d. 1463),
          physician and professor at Lisbon, afterward bishop of Lamego,
          and later bishop of Vizeu. In 1425 Vicenza and his followers,
          who had made pilgrimages throughout Portugal, received the
          Benedictine cloister of San Salvador in Villar de Frades. They
          adopted the dress and statutes of the canons regular of San
          Giorgio in Alga, at Venice, and received papal confirmation
          under this title. In another house near Lisbon they received the
          name Canons Regular of the Congregation of St. John the
          Evangelist. The Boni homines of San Salvador were later included
          under this title. They gradually attained a strength of fourteen
          houses in Portugal, and also maintained missions in India and
          Ethiopia.

          After the [468]Minims had come into possession of the house of
          the Grammontensians at Vincennes they, too, came to be called
          bons hommes. Even at an earlier date it seems that the Minims in
          Paris had been contemptuously called bons hommes. The same name
          was also appropriated by certain heretical sects, for instance,
          by the Cathari (see [469]New Manicheans) and by the Brethren of
          the Free Spirit. In Florence, in the thirteenth century, the
          twelve men elected to restore order after the withdrawal of the
          Ghibellines were called buoni uomini, likewise the overseers of
          the thirteen city districts in Rome in the fourteenth century.

   Bonizo (Bonitho)
          BONIZO (BONITHO): Bishop of Sutri; b. at Cremona c. 1045; d. at
          Piacenza July 14, probably 1090. As a young cleric he joined the
          Patarene movement (see [470]Patarenes) in Cremona and Piacenza.
          He came to Rome in 1074, possibly in consequence of his conflict
          with Bishop Dionysius of Piacenza, and was himself made bishop
          of Sutri in 1075 or 1076. In the spring of 1078 he was in
          Lombardy as legate, and back in Rome by November, when he took
          part in the synod that discussed Berengar's teachings. A zealous
          partizan of Gregory VII, he was imprisoned by Henry IV in 1082
          and entrusted for safe-keeping to the antipope Guibert of
          Ravenna (Clement III). He contrived to escape, but never
          returned to his see. In 1085 he found shelter with Countess
          Matilda, and in the summer of 1086 was chosen bishop of Piacenza
          by the Patarene party. His election being uncanonical, Anselm of
          Milan, the metropolitan, refused to install him; but he
          succeeded in gaining the approval of Pope Urban II in 1088 or
          1089. He did not long enjoy his triumph, meeting a violent death
          in a rising of the imperialist party. The most important of his
          writings, the Liber ad amicum (ed. E. Dümmler, MGH, Libelli de
          lite, i, 1891), composed between the death of Gregory VII and
          the accession of Victor III (1085-86), besides discussing the
          question whether a Christian may bear arms in the defense of the
          Church (which he answers in the affirmative), shown by an
          extended historical sketch that the Church grows under
          persecution. The chief value of the work is due to its
          presentation of the ideas of Gregory and his adherents; it
          informs us how the papal camp judged of the numerous theological
          and ecclesiastico-political controversies of the time, and as a
          whole is one of the most noteworthy productions of the Gregorian
          party. Often as it has been appealed to as a contemporary
          source, it has to be used with caution, owing not only to
          carelessness and errors of detail, but to demonstrable
          perversions of history, as in the account of the Canossa
          episode. In fact, it is colored throughout by the author's
          subjective standpoint. The Liber in Hugonem schismaticum
          (presumably Cardinal Hugo Candidus) has unfortunately been lost.
          As a canonist Bonizo left a large Decretum in ten books, from
          which Mai published extracts in 1854.

   Bonner, Edmund
          BONNER, EDMUND: Bishop of London; b., probably at Hanley,
          Worcestershire, about 1500; d. in the Marshalsea prison, at
          Southwark, near London, Sept. 5, 1569. He studied at Pembroke
          College (then called Broadgate Hall), Oxford (B.C.L., 1519;
          D.C.L., 1525), and was ordained about 1519. He received his
          first preferment from Cardinal Wolsey; after the death of Wolsey
          (1530) he served the king, received a number of benefices, and
          was employed at different times as ambassador to the pope, to
          the king of France, and to the emperor; he was made bishop of
          London in 1539. He fell out with the privy council, which
          undertook to govern under Edward VI (1547), and in 1549 was
          reprimanded for not enforcing the use of the new prayer-book,
          deprived of his bishopric, and imprisoned. The accession of Mary
          (1553) brought his release and reinstated him in his see. He is
          remembered chiefly by his connection with the religious
          persecutions of the reign of Mary and it is said that in three
          years he condemned more than two hundred persons to the stake.
          In 1559, after the accession of Elizabeth, he refused to take
          the oath of supremacy and was imprisoned and kept in confinement
          till his death. It has been usual to represent Bishop Bonner as
          unprincipled and cruel; yet his firmness in following the
          unpopular course and the suffering undergone in consequence do
          not indicate a lack of principle; to judge and condemn heretics
          was one of the duties of his position, and it is not clear that
          he took delight in undue severity; there is documentary evidence
          that he acted under pressure from the queen and her husband
          (Philip II of Spain). He was unpopular in London apart from the
          persecutions. He wrote a preface for the second edition of
          Gardiner's De vera obedientia (Hamburg, 1536) and published a
          collection of Homilies for his diocese (London, 1555, and many
          later editions).

   Bonnet, Alfred Maximilien
          BONNET, ben?´´nê´, ALFRED MAXIMILIEN: French classical scholar;
          b. at Frankfort Nov. 3, 1841. He was educated at Bonn
          University, and, after being a professor at the academy of
          Lausanne in 1866-74 and at the École Monge and the École
          Alsacienne at Paris in 1874-81, was successively lecturer and
          instructor in the faculty of letters at Montpellier. Since 1890
          he has been professor of Latin in the same institution. In 1898
          he was elected a corresponding member of the Academy of
          Inscriptions, and has written, among other work, Narratio de
          miraculo a Michaele archangelo Chonis patrato, adjecto Symeonis
          Metaphrastæ de eadem re libello (Paris, 1890) and Le Latin de
          Grégoire de Tours (1890); and has prepared editions of the Liber
          de miraculis beati Andreæ apostoli, in MGH, Script. rer. Merov.,
          i (1885), 821-846, the Acts of Thomas (Leipsic, 1883) and of
          Andrew (1895), and the Acta apostolorum apocrypha (1891 sqq.; in
          collaboration with R. A. Lipsius).

   Bonnet, Jules
          BONNET, JULES: French Protestant layman; b. at Nîmes (40 m. n.e.
          of Montpellier) June 30, 1820; d. there Mar. 23, 1892. He was
          educated as a lawyer, but became a professor in the University
          of France and gained recognition by his works on the history of
          the Reformation. He was also secretary of the Société d'Histoire
          du Protestantisme Français and editor of its publications. Among
          his works special mention may be made of the following: Olympia
          Morata, épisode de la renaissance en Italie (Paris, 1850; Eng.
          transl., Edinburgh, 1852); Lettres françaises de Calvin (2
          vols., 1854; Eng. transl., 4 vols., Edinburgh, 1855-57); Calvin
          au val d'Aoste (1861); Aonio Paleario, étude sur la réforme en
          Italie (1863; Eng. transl., London, 1864); Récits du seizième
          siècle (1864); Nouveaux recits du seizième siècle (1869); La
          Réforme au château de Saint Privat (1873); Notice sur la vie et
          les écrits de M. Merle d'Aubigné (1874); Derniers récits du
          seizième siècle (1875); Quelques souvenirs sur Augustin Thierry
          (1877); Famille de Curione, récit du seizième siècle (Basel,
          1878); Histoire des souffrances du bienheureux martyr Louis de
          Marolles (Paris, 1882); Souvenirs de l'Église réformée de la
          Calmette (1884); and Récits du seizième siècle, troisième série
          (1885). He also edited the Mémoires de la vie de Jean de
          Parthenay-Larchevêque, sieur de Soubise (Paris, 1879), while his
          own letters from 1851 to 1863 have been edited by E. de Bude
          (Geneva, 1898).

   Bonnivard, Francois de
          BONNIVARD, ben´´nî´´v??r´, FRANÇOIS DE: The "Prisoner of
          Chillon"; b. at Seyssel on the Rhone (21 m. s.w. of Geneva) c.
          1493; d. at Geneva 1570. As a younger son he entered the Church
          and became prior of St. Victor near Geneva; certain other
          benefices to which he thought he was entitled he failed to
          receive through the intrigues of Charles III, duke of Savoy; in
          consequence he joined the party of the young Genevan patriots
          who were resisting the duke's attempts to gain control of the
          city. When the duke entered Geneva in 1519, Bonnivard fled, but
          fell into the hands of the duke, and was imprisoned for twenty
          months. On May 28, 1530 he was arrested near Lausanne, taken to
          the castle of Chillon at the east end of Lake Geneva and kept
          there for six years. It is this imprisonment which Byron has
          immortalized in verse more musical than truthful. The first two
          years were tolerable; but after a visit from the duke in 1532 he
          was put in the dungeon now shown to visitors. It is only a local
          tradition that he was chained to a pillar. In the spring of 1536
          the Bernese took the castle and freed Bonnivard. During his
          incarceration the priory and church of St. Victor had been razed
          and the income of the estates applied to the city hospital. As
          indemnification he was pensioned and given a liberal sum to pay
          his debts. He adopted the Reformation and married four times,
          but no time happily. He made the city of Geneva his heir on
          condition that it should pay his debts; but his estate consisted
          only of certain books which formed the beginning of the city
          library. Bonnivard's literary activity was the chief reason for
          the forbearance which his contemporaries showed him; his career
          was somewhat wavering, time-serving, and dishonorable. In 1517
          he was entitled "poet-laureate," and after his liberation he was
          commissioned by the magistracy to write a history of the
          republic of Geneva. This work, Les Chroniques de Genève
          (published at Geneva, 2 vols., 1831), ends with 1551, is full of
          anecdotes and interesting, but unreliable. Other works which
          have been published are: Advis et devis des langues (Geneva,
          1849); Advis et devis de la source de l'idolatrie et tyrannie
          papale (1856); De l'ancienne et nouvelle police de Genève
          (1865).

   Bonnus, Hermannus
          BONNUS, HERMANNUS (Hermann Gude?): German Reformer; b. at
          Quackenbrück, in Osnabrück, 1504; d. at Lübeck Feb. 12, 1548. He
          was educated apparently first at Münster, then in Bugenhagen's
          school at Treptow, but certainly entered the University of
          Wittenberg in 1523, coming under the influence of Luther and
          Melanchthon. In 1525, probably, he migrated to Greifswald, and
          about two years later went to Gottorp to act as tutor to the
          six-year-old son of Frederick I of Denmark. Thence he was called
          to Lübeck in 1530, and (on Bugenhagen's organization of the
          Evangelical Church there) made superintendent in the following
          February. Here he remained until his death, in spite of calls to
          Hamburg in 1532 and to Lüneburg in 1534. He represented his town
          in the conference of the six free cities of Lübeck, Bremen,
          Hamburg, Rostock, Stralsund, and Lüneburg, held at Hamburg in
          1535 to concert measures for dealing with Papists, Anabaptists,
          and Sacramentarians. In 1543 he visited Osnabrück to take part
          in the establishment of a Reformed system and liturgy which
          received the approval of the bishop, Franz von Waldeck, and was
          later extended to the whole diocese. The attempt to carry it
          into that of Münster was forcibly resisted by the chapter, but
          met with partial success in the country districts. His influence
          was extended by his Low German catechism (1539) and by his
          services to the hymnody of this dialect. He certainly edited and
          revised several collections of both German and Latin hymns, and
          probably contributed some of his own. He took a courageous part
          against the democratic revolution in Lübeck under Wullenweber,
          and in his Chronika der kaiserlichen Stadt Lübeck (1539) pointed
          out the dangers of innovating tendencies. After the formal
          adoption of the Augsburg Confession in 1535, he contended
          successfully against the efforts of the Roman Catholic party to
          regain control and against the propaganda of the Anabaptists.
          His office required him to expound the Scriptures, and his
          discourses on the Acts and on the liturgical epistles for the
          Sundays were published. In accordance with the Hamburg
          decisions, which had required preachers to dwell upon the
          examples of the saints, he published in 1539 a compilation of
          hagiographical extracts. The king of Denmark tried to secure him
          for an important office (probably the bishopric of Sleswick),
          but he refused to leave Lübeck, where his body was deposited
          amid universal mourning in St. Mary's church.

    1. Heresy and Suspension of Bonosus.

          From a letter written to Anysius of Thessalonica and the other
          Illyrian bishops, soon after the Synod of Capua (winter of
          391-392), by either Pope Siricius or an unknown Italian bishop,
          we learn certain facts about a bishop Bonosus, whose see is not
          given. He had been accused, apparently by neighboring bishops,
          but of what does not clearly appear in the letter, except that
          he had asserted that Mary bore other children to Joseph, after
          the birth of Jesus. The case came before this synod at Capua,
          called by the emperor Theodosius to put an end to the schism at
          Antioch (see [471]Meletius of Antioch); but the synod referred
          it to the bishops whose dioceses bordered on those of both
          parties, especially the Macedonian prelates. The decision was in
          favor of suspension, a temporary provision being made for the
          administration of Bonosus's diocese. He wrote to St. Ambrose to
          know whether he was bound to heed this sentence, and Ambrose
          counseled patience. Meantime the bishops hesitated to make the
          sentence absolute, and would have been glad of the opinion of
          the writer of the letter. He, however, whether Siricius or some
          one else, declared that it did not belong to him "to decide as
          if by authority of a synod"; the responsibility, he told them,
          rested on them of forming such a decision that neither the
          accused nor the accusers should be able to evade it. So much
          consideration was not usually shown to "heretics"; there may
          have been circumstances connected with the case which we do not
          know. But to deny the perpetual virginity of Mary was a serious
          offense from the stand point of the time (see [472]Helvidius).
          Ambrose speaks (De instit. virg., v, 35) of a bishop being
          accused of this "sacrilege"--probably meaning Bonosus. It is,
          therefore, evident that at this time Bonosus was accused of no
          worse or further heresies.

    2. Final Condemnation of Bonosus.

          Some twenty years later we hear more of Bonosus in two letters
          of Innocent I--one to Marcian of Naïssus, northwest of Sardica,
          and a later one to the bishops of Illyria. From them it appears
          that Bonosus had been definitely condemned by his fellow
          bishops, and had then founded a separate ecclesiastical
          organization of his own. For the avoiding of scandal, those who
          had been ordained by him were, if they wished it, received back
          into the Church as clerics. Innocent allows this only in the
          case of those ordained by Bonosus before his condemnation; but
          here again his heresy is not specified. Twenty years later still
          (431), Marius Mercator names Marcellus, Photinus, "and lately
          the Sardican bishop, Bonosus, who was condemned by Pope
          Damascus, among the followers of Ebion." There is practically no
          doubt that this is the same Bonosus; in this case, and accepting
          the statement of Marius, we have learned that Bonosus was bishop
          of Sardica, and that his errors had grown, after 392, into
          dynamistic Monarchianism. We have no further information as to
          the fate of his following in the Balkan peninsula. The mention
          of him in the so-called Decretum Gelasii, even if it was written
          by Gelasius, and the anathemas pronounced against him by
          Vigilius in 552 and 553 prove nothing on this point. If Gregory
          I in his Epistola ad Quiricum really named the Bonosiaci with
          the Cataphrygians as heretics who needed rebaptism because they
          did not believe in Christ the Lord, this is not very strong
          evidence for the continued existence of the body, and tells
          nothing of its locality.

    3. Bonosians in Spain and Southern Gaul.

          The case is different with the repeated mentions of Bonosiaci or
          Bonosiani by the writers of Spain and southern Gaul. Gennadius
          quotes the Spanish bishop Audentius (end of fourth century) as
          having specially written against them, which proves at least
          that Gennadius knew them; he speaks in another place of
          "Photinians, who now are called Bonosians." A little later
          Avitus of Vienne mentions them in two well-known passages; in
          one he expresses himself in relation to King Gundobad (see
          [473]Burgundians) as willing to accept their baptism. The 17th
          canon of the so-called Second Synod of Arles (generally placed
          443-452) shows the same conciliatory attitude; but the Third
          Synod of Orlèans (538) tells us that the Bonosians rebaptized
          their converts, which may be taken to show that their baptism
          was not then recognized by the other side. About the same time,
          according to Isidore of Seville, Justinian of Valencia was
          writing against them his lost Liber responsionum contra
          Bonosianos, qui Christum adoptivum filium et non proprium
          dicunt. While for Gaul the latest reference is given by the
          Synod of Clichy in 626 or 627; showing thus their gradual
          extinction there, in Spain they were attracting attention fifty
          years later; the Synod of Toledo in 675, declaring that Christ
          was the Son of God by nature, not by adoption, was plainly
          directed against them. On the other hand, the mention of
          Bonosus--not of the Bonosians--in the Adoptionist controversy
          (see [474]Adoptionism) does not prove that they lasted to the
          eighth century in Spain, nor is the medieval view that
          Adoptionism was a revival of the heresy of Bonosus worth
          considering. They really disappear with the end of the seventh
          century.

    4. Sympathy between Bonosians and Arians.

          That these mentions of Bonosians from the fifth to the seventh
          centuries are not merely the survival of an old term of
          opprobrium, but that they really existed in Spain and southern
          Gaul at that period has long been justly accepted. It is still
          further confirmed by a passage of Avitus, whose true reading
          (Bonosiacorum for bonorum) has only lately been established.
          Writing to Sigismund, his convert son of the Arian king
          Gundobad, he gives the information that the latter had formally
          promised to set up a Bonosian community in his kingdom by the
          establishment of a bishop of their faith, and that this body was
          recruited from the Arians. This would explain the attitude of
          Gennadius toward their baptism. Avitus took an opposite view,
          either to conciliate the king, who at that time gave hopes of
          his conversion, or from motives of general policy. The Bonosians
          began to be absorbed into, the Arian body; toward the end of
          Gundobad's reign Avitus had hopes that they would entirely
          disappear, if the king could be induced to let his promises to
          them lapse into oblivion. The later history shows that this hope
          proved false, because the sect was not confined to Burgundian
          territory; and it is not surprising that sharp measures were
          taken against those who remained obdurate in their heresy under
          Catholic rule. Only one thing can be urged against the
          correctness of the account here given--the recognition of the
          validity of Bonosian baptism by the synod said to have been held
          at Arles about 450; but this really tells the other way, for
          general support is now accorded to the theory put forth in the
          eighteenth century that this second synod of Arles never had any
          existence, the canons attributed to it being nothing but a
          collection of various older synodical decisions made toward the
          end of the fifth century, and canon xvii having then first been
          heard of. Accordingly it is safe to say that the Bonosians in
          the generally Arian territories of the Burgundians and the
          West-Goths were the followers of Bonosus of Sardica, though the
          name Bonosus was not an uncommon one.

    5. Relation between Bonosus and the Bonosians.

          Isidore of Seville says expressly that they had sprung "from a
          certain bishop Bonosus," and the "plague of the Bonosians" did
          not begin in the Burgundian kingdom, since Avitus speaks of it
          as ab infernalibus latebris excitata. The district in which
          Bonosus of Sardica labored bordered on territories held in his
          time by the West-Goths, and relations may well have remained
          close between that region and the West-Goths of the south of
          Gaul; so that the passage of his teaching from the Balkan
          peninsula into the Burgundian kingdom, which was in close
          contact with the West-Goths, is perfectly possible, and we may
          safely conclude to accept the statement of Marius Mercator.

          (F. Loofs.)

          The wide-spread acceptance of the Adoptionist view of the person
          of Christ from the apostolic time throughout the Middle Ages and
          beyond (Ebionites, Shepherd of Hermas, Theodotas of Rome, Paul
          of Samosata, the Paulicians, most medieval sects, many
          Anabaptists, and others) makes it easy to account for this
          aspect of the teaching of the Bonosians as well as for the
          Spanish Adoptionism of the eighth century without the
          supposition of its independent origin in either case. For much
          valuable information on the early origin and the persecution of
          Adoptionist Christology cf. F. C. Conybeare, The Key of Truth; A
          Manual of the Paulician Church of Armenia. The Armenian Text
          edited and translated with illustrative Documents and
          Introduction (Oxford, 1898).

          theologian; b. at Nortla, Russia, Feb. 17, 1848. He was educated
          at the universities of Dorpat (1866-70), Göttingen (1874-75),
          and Bonn (1877-78), the time between his residence at these
          universities being spent in practical pastoral work. He became
          privat-docent at Dorpat in 1878 and associate professor of
          church history four years later, while from 1883 to 1891 he was
          full professor in the same university. Since 1891 he has been
          professor of church history at Göttingen . In addition to
          numerous contributions to theological journals and religious
          encyclopedias, he edited Thomasius's Dogmengeschichte der alten
          Kirche (Erlangen, 1886) and the Studien zur Geschichte der
          Theologie und Kirche in collaboration with R. Seeberg (Leipsic,

   Boos, Martin
          BOOS, MARTIN: Roman Catholic priest; b. at Huttenried near
          Schongau, Bavaria, Dec. 25, 1762; d. at Sayn, near Coblenz, Aug.
          29, 1825. He studied at Dillingen under Sailer, Zimmer, and
          Weber. He followed the extreme practises of asceticism as a
          penance for sin, all to no avail, as he believed, and then
          developed a doctrine of salvation by faith which came very near
          to pure Lutheranism. This he preached with great effect. He was
          driven from Bavaria by the opposition of the ecclesiastical
          authorities and other priests and lived in Austria from 1799 to
          1816, when he was compelled to leave that country. His last
          years were spent at Düsseldorf and Sayn.

   Booth, Ballington
          BOOTH, BALLINGTON: General-in-chief and president of the
          Volunteers of America; b. at Brighouse (4 m. e.s.e. of Halifax),
          Yorkshire, England, July 28, 1859. He was educated at a private
          school in Bristol and subsequently at Trenton Collegiate
          Institute and Nottingham Seminary, Nottingham, England. He was
          commander of the Salvation Army in Australia from 1885 to 1887,
          and held the same office in the United States from 1887 to 1896.
          In the latter year his connection with the Salvation Army
          ceased, however, and he established a similar though not
          identical organization known as the [475]Volunteers of America,
          of which he has since been the head. He was ordained at Chicago
          in August, 1896, a presbyter in the Christian Church.

   Booth, Catherine (Mumford)
          BOOTH, CATHERINE (MUMFORD): "Mother of the Salvation Army"; b.
          at Ashbourne (13 m. n.w. of Derby), Derbyshire, England, Jan.
          17, 1829; d. at Clacton-on-Sea (13 m. s.e. of Colchester),
          Essex, Oct. 4, 1890. She was educated chiefly at home, and in
          1844 removed with her parents to London. In the same year she
          joined the Wesleyan congregation at Brixton, but four years
          later was debarred from that organization, together with others.
          These "Reformers," as they called themselves, then formed a
          separate congregation, and in 1851 she became acquainted with
          her future husband, [476]William Booth, likewise an
          excommunicated "Reformer." Four years later they were married,
          and in 1858 she first took public part in her husband's pastoral
          work at Gateshead, Durham, where he was then located. Two years
          later, after the publication of a pamphlet defending the right
          of women to preach, she delivered her first sermon in her
          husband's pulpit, and within the next three years began to
          conduct independent religious meetings, leading successful
          missions at Margate in 1867 and at Portsmouth in 1873. Meanwhile
          the plan which resulted in the formation of the [477]Salvation
          Army was maturing, and the new organization was definitely
          formulated in 1877. Mrs. Booth herself took an active part in
          the work, especially among women and children. Her greatest work
          as a revivalist was done in 1886-87, but in the following year
          she was stricken with cancer, which ultimately caused her death.
          She wrote Papers on Practical Religion (London, 1879); Papers on
          Aggressive Christianity (1881); Papers on Godliness (1882); Life
          and Death (1883); The Salvation Army in Relation to the Church
          and State (1883); and Popular Christianity (1887).

   Booth, William
          BOOTH, WILLIAM: Commander-in-chief of the Salvation Army; b. at
          Nottingham, England, Apr. 10, 1829. He was educated by a private
          theological tutor of the Methodist New Connexion Church, and
          began his career as an open air preacher at the age of fifteen.
          He entered the ministry of the Methodist New Connexion Church in
          1852, and was successively a traveling evangelist and a circuit
          preacher until 1861, when he left the denomination to devote
          himself entirely to evangelistic work. In 1865 he founded at
          London the Christian Mission for the amelioration of the
          condition of the destitute and vicious population of the eastern
          portion of London, and this developed, in 1878, into the
          [478]Salvation Army. He has traveled extensively in the
          interests of his Army, and has written Salvation Soldiery
          (1890); In Darkest England and the Way Out (1890); and Religion
          for Every Day (1902).

          Durham, Jan. 8, 1860; d. near Dean Lake, Mo., Oct. 28, 1903. She
          was the daughter of [479]William Booth, the founder of the
          Salvation Army, and from 1880 to 1888 was in charge of the
          international training homes of that organization. In the latter
          year, she married Frederick St. George de Lautour Tucker (see
          the following article), and went with him successively to India
          and London, whence she came to the United States in 1896. She
          held the rank of consul in the Salvation Army, and had equal
          powers with her husband in its control. She died from injuries
          received in a railroad accident. A volume of selections from her
          writing has been published under the title The Cross and Our
          Comfort (London, 1907).

   Booth Tucker, Frederick St. George de Lautour
          BOOTH TUCKER, FREDERICK ST. GEORGE DE LAUTOUR: Secretary for
          Foreign Affairs of the Salvation Army; b. at Monghyr (80 m. e.
          of Patna), Bengal, Mar. 21, 1853. He was educated at Cheltenham
          College, England, and passed the examinations for the India
          Civil Service in 1874. After two years of additional study, he
          was appointed to the Punjab, where he was successively assistant
          commissioner and treasury officer. He resigned from the service,
          however, in 1881 to join the Salvation Army, which he
          established in India in the following year. He remained in
          command of the Army there until 1891, when he was transferred to
          London as secretary for international work. He held this office
          for five years, and from 1896 to 1904 was commander of the Army
          in the United States. Since the latter year he has been
          Secretary for Foreign Affairs of the Salvation Army, with
          headquarters in London, and is thus responsible to [480]General
          William Booth for all work of the organization outside of the
          British Isles. In 1888 he married the daughter of Gen. William
          Booth (see the preceding article) and subsequently assumed the
          name of Booth Tucker. He has written In Darkest India and the
          Way Out (Bombay, 1891); The Life of Catherine Booth (2 vols.,
          Chicago, 1892); Life of General William Booth (1898); and
          Favorite Songs of the Salvation Army (1899).

   Bora, Katharina von
          BORA, KATHARINA VON: Luther's wife; b. of an old family of
          Klein-Laussig, near Bitterfeld in Meissen, Jan. 29, 1499; d. at
          Torgau Dec. 20, 1552. She was placed in the Cistercian convent
          of Nimpsch at Grimma (17 m. s.e. of Leipsic) when a child and
          became a nun in 1515; with the cognizance of Luther she and
          eight other nuns fled from the convent Apr. 4, 1523, and
          repaired to Wittenberg. She is said to have refused an offer of
          marriage from Dr. Kasper Glatz, vicar at Orlamünde, and at the
          same time to have expressed a preference for Amsdorf or Luther.
          She was married to the latter June 13, 1525, and bore him six
          children. She proved a true wife, was a good housekeeper, and
          the marriage was a happy one. After Luther's death (Feb. 18,
          1546) she remained at Wittenberg, much of the time in poverty.
          Her death was due to an accident which occurred as she was on
          the way, with her children, to Torgau to escape the plague at
          Wittenberg.

   Bordelumians
          BORDELUMIANS: A separatistic sect formed at Bordelum, a village
          of Sleswick, about 1739, under the leadership of a pietistic
          Saxon theological student named David Bähr. They originally
          consisted of fifteen or twenty persons, and claimed to be saints
          who had advanced further than Paul according to Rom. vii, 24.
          Since they believed that they had received special gifts from
          God, they decried the Church as the house of the devil, and
          despised the sacramants. As being pure, to whom all things were
          pure, they rejected marriage in favor of free love, and
          instituted a communism of property for their financial support.
          An edict of Christian VI, issued June 11, 1739, condemned the
          leaders to imprisonment; those who had led an immoral life were
          punished according to the laws, and the remainder were
          admonished. The leaders managed to escape the punishment,
          however, Bähr, who had seduced a married woman, fleeing to Jena.
          Expelled from that city, he returned to Holstein, and was
          imprisoned at Glückstadt. Having become a cripple in consequence
          of the rough treatment to which he had been subjected in prison,
          he was released, and died wretchedly, still unconverted, at
          Bredstädt in 1743. His adherents caused much trouble to the
          pastor of Bordelum.

          les documents originaux et les monuments de l'art de chaque
          époque. At the time of his death he was engaged upon a new and
          enlarged edition of the brothers Eugéne and Émile Haag's La
          France protestante (originally 12 vols., Paris, 1845-59), and

          BOREEL, bo´´rêl´, ADAM: Preacher and sectary; b. at Middelburg,
          in Zealand, 1603; d. in Amsterdam 1666. He was pastor of a
          Reformed congregation, but resigned his office, and became the
          leader of a separatistic party, which acknowledged no other
          religious authority than the Scripture. His work, Ad legem et
          testimonium (1645), attracted great attention. Here he developed
          that the written word of God, without any human commentary, was
          the sole means of awakening faith; that the Church had fallen
          completely away from the Lord; that the Christian ought to shun
          all connection with the Established Church, and confine himself
          to his private devotion, etc. His minor writings, fifteen in
          number, were collected at Amsterdam, 1683. His followers, known
          as Boreelists, never attained to much importance.

          Mar. 2, 1858. He was educated at the universities of Göttingen
          (Ph.D., 1879) and Leipsic, and was successively tutor at Bremen
          (1879) and Medingen (1880). Two years later he became inspector
          of the seminary at Göttingen, and in 1884 was privat-docent for
          church history in the same university. In 1886 he was appointed
          inspector of the seminary for theological candidates at
          Magdeburg, where he became professor in the following year. From
          1898 to 1902 he was professor of theology at Basel, and since
          the latter year has been pastor of the Luther Church at
          Frankfort. His works include In investiganda monachatus origine
          quibus de causis ratio habenda sit Origenis (Göttingen,1886);

          at the universities of Halle and Greifswald, and was pastor at
          Sinsheim (1890-94) and Carlsruhe (1894-1902). In 1902 he became
          associate professor of systematic and practical theology at
          Greifswald, and in 1905-06 was also assistant to the professor
          of practical theology at Halle. Became professor of systematic

   Bornholmers
          BORNHOLMERS: Danish sect of the nineteenth century. During the
          first part of the century different parts of Sweden were
          permeated with sects which emphasized the gospel of the free and
          unmerited grace of God in Christ. About 1805 the Nya Läsare
          ("New Readers") originated in the congregation at Piteå in
          Norrbotten, deviating from the old Läsare, who adhered to the
          Lutheran doctrines, by asserting that saving faith may be found
          in those whose hearts are still attached to sin and the world,
          and by regarding the importance attributed to the law as a
          temptation to pharisaical self-righteousness. In the course of
          time this party, headed by a soldier named Erik Stalberg, broke
          with the State Church, and finally the "New Readers" declared
          that the ministers of the latter preached the doctrine of the
          devil. In the fifth decade of the century, the Finnish preacher
          Frederik Gabriel Hedberg, afterward provost and preacher at
          Kimito in the archbishopric of Abo, evolved similar views in a
          work on "Pietism and Christianity," in which he accused Spener
          and his followers of teaching that man must be holy and pure
          before he can rely on the unmerited grace in Christ, whereas
          Hedberg seems to have regarded man as a soul hungering for
          grace, but utterly unable to aid himself in the attainment of
          salvation. In 1846 a party of Hedbergians was formed at
          Stockholm and Helsingland which rejected all preaching of
          repentance. A like tendency was manifested by the sect headed by
          Karl Olof Rosenius (b. 1816; d. 1868), who had been greatly
          influenced by the Methodist George Scott, who labored in the
          Swedish capital. Rosenius, who sought to remain a true Lutheran
          throughout his life, emphasized the grace of God in Christ. His
          sermons and his magazine, which he entitled Pietisten, although
          he was opposed to the legalism of the Pietists, exercised an
          important influence on the religious life of Sweden.
          Hedbergianism and the writings of Rosenius gave rise between
          1850 and 1870 to a new evangelical party in many parts of
          Sweden, whose sole dogma was the forgiveness of sins without
          merit of the sinner, and whose watchword, "the world is
          justified in Christ," won them many proselytes not only in
          Sweden and Norway, but also in the American Synod of Missouri.

          The new evangelism found a fertile soil in the Danish island of
          Bornholm (in the Baltic Sea, 90 m. e. of Zealand), which became
          the center of propaganda for a part of Denmark. The movement was
          inaugurated by P. C. Trandberg, a powerful preacher of
          repentance, who had broken with the State Church, and by 1863
          had gathered about him almost a thousand followers. Trandberg
          sent out laypreachers, and the "Bornholmers," as they were
          called, were soon found in North Zealand, Copenhagen, Lolland,
          Falster, and West Jutland. His adherents gradually lost
          confidence in him, however, and in 1877 he resigned. Later he
          became professor in the Dano-Norwegian department of Chicago
          Theological Seminary and died in 1896. As a rule, the
          Bornholmers are pious and earnest, and their antinomistic theory
          usually becomes nomistic, and even quasipietistic in practise,
          thus forming a bond of union between them and the "Inner
          Mission" in Denmark, and making them one of the means to awaken
          spiritual life in many of the Danish people.

   Borowski, Ludwig Ernst von
          BOROWSKI, bo-rov´skî, LUDWIG ERNST VON: A prominent Prussian
          evangelical preacher; b. at Königsberg June 17, 1740, of a
          well-to-do Polish family which had emigrated on account of its
          religion; d. in Berlin Nov. 10, 1831. In his fourteenth year he
          went to the University of Königsberg, where he was one of Kant's
          earliest pupils, practised oratory, and showed an inclination
          toward literature. His theological convictions were not
          influenced by Kant, despite a lasting personal devotion, but
          rather by the supernaturalist school. In 1758 Kant recommended
          him to General von Knobloch as a tutor in his family; but before
          long Field-marshal von Kunheim, impressed by Borowski's
          oratorical gifts, urged him to become a military chaplain. This
          career he finally took up in 1762, being ordained by Süssmilch,
          and joining his regiment in the camp at Sorau soon afterward. He
          remained with the army until 1770, when Süsamilch had him
          appointed superintendent of the district of Schaaken in East
          Prussia. Here he labored diligently for twelve years, until he
          was called to a pastoral charge in his native town. The
          development of his preaching powers and theological knowledge
          won him increasing prominence; in 1793 the king appointed him a
          member of the special commission on churches and schools, and he
          received the title of consistorial councilor in 1804. When the
          storms of war burst over Germany, he rose to the height of the
          occasion, and his eloquent exhortations had a deep effect on
          Frederick William III and his queen, who resided in Königsberg
          from 1807 to 1809. The king's warm affection and respect
          continued to be shown through the years that followed. In 1812
          he made Borowski general superintendent, in 1815 first court
          preacher, in 1816 a bishop, and in 1829 archbishop of the
          Prussian Evangelical Church. These last years of his life, old
          as he was, were full of incessant activity; he was president of
          the Bible Society and of the Missionary Union founded in 1822.
          Outside of his preaching, however, he gave more thought to the
          training of his candidates for ordination than to anything else,
          and even in the wanderings of his last illness his mind was
          occupied with them.

   Borrhaus, Martin (Cellarius)
          BORRHAUS, MARTIN (generally known as CELLARIUS): German
          theologian; b. at Stuttgart 1499; d. at Basel Oct. 11, 1564.
          Being educated and adopted by his kinsman Simon Cellarius, he
          called himself Cellarius until about forty years of age,
          although the name of his parents seems to have been Burress or
          Borrhus. In 1515 he was made magister artium at Tübingen, where
          he became intimately acquainted with Melanchthon, two years his
          senior. He was made bachelor of theology under Reuchlin at
          Ingolstadt in 1521, and became a friend of Marcus Stübner at
          Wittenberg. The eight sermons delivered by Luther after his
          return from the Wartburg impressed Cellarius deeply, but his
          zeal in defense of Stübner was such that he left Wittenberg,
          where he had treated Luther with rudeness, and went to
          Switzerland, whence he traveled by way of Austria and Poland to
          Prussia, which had just embraced the Evangelical faith. There he
          was tried, and required to sign a bond in which he promised to
          return at once to Wittenberg. His interview with Luther in 1526
          filled the latter with respect for Cellarius, who now settled in
          southern Germany, winning the hearts of Capito and Butzer in
          Strasburg. In 1527 he published his first work, De operibus Dei,
          and in 1544 he was appointed professor of the Old Testament at
          Basel, where, in collaboration with Castello and Curio, he
          composed a polemical treatise under the name of Martin Bellius,
          directed against Calvin in the Servetus controversy. He rejected
          infant baptism, but was a firm believer in predestination.

   Borromeo, Carlo
          BORROMEO, CARLO: Italian prelate and reformer; b. at Arona (on
          the s.w. shore of Lago Maggiore, 37 m. n.w. of Milan) Oct. 2,
          1538; d. at Milan Nov. 3, 1584. He was the nephew of Giovanni
          Angelo Medici (afterward Pope Pius IV), and even in his boyhood
          showed an inclination for the priesthood, receiving his first
          benefice at the age of twelve through the resignation of an
          uncle. Four years later he went to Pavia, where he studied law,
          and had just taken his degree in 1559, when the newly elected
          Pius IV invited him to Rome. His rise was extraordinary, and at
          the age of twenty-two he was a cardinal and the archbishop of
          Milan. When the Council of Trent was reopened on Jan. 18, 1562,
          Borromeo used his influence in securing the sharp formulation of
          questions relating to discipline and faith. He also governed the
          Romagna and the March, both of which had been added to the papal
          dominions in the course of the fifteenth century. In foreign
          politics nothing took place without him and he was also an
          active member of the Congregation of the Inquisition, besides
          being the protector of the Franciscans, the Knights of Malta,
          and the Carmelites. He could maintain such an activity, however,
          only while he lived at Rome; conforming to the decision of the
          Council which required all bishops to reside in their own
          dioceses, he removed to Milan, where he had already prepared a
          house for the Jesuits, who acted as his instruments in
          reorganizing his diocese of Milan. Borromeo's activity here had
          scarcely begun when Pius IV died, but his successor Pius V
          assisted the archbishop in the reorganization of the largest of
          the Italian dioceses, which was to be a model for all. Borromeo
          founded seminaries for the better education of the clergy in the
          strictest ecclesiastical spirit, and also introduced rigid
          church discipline, beginning with the clergy; his efforts to
          popularize synodical work and to improve the existing orders, as
          well as his introduction of others, such as the Theatines, into
          Italy were all designed to further the same object. In revenge,
          some degenerate monks who had been affected by his reform,
          planned his murder, but by a miracle, as it was claimed, he
          escaped the bullet of his would-be assassins. Hand in hand with
          the reform within the Church went a merciless severity against
          every form of "heresy" in Lombardy, the Valtellina, and the
          Engadine, as well as against "witches" in Valcamonica. During
          the plague of 1576 he heroically cared for the sick and buried
          the dead, while the officials fled in terror from the city. His
          statue near Arona still recalls the memory of Borromeo, who
          became, by his canonization in 1610, the saint of the Counter
          reformation.

   Borrow, George (Henry)
          BORROW, GEORGE (HENRY): English adventurer and writer; b. at
          East Dereham (15 m. w.n.w. of Norwich), Norfolk, July 5, 1803;
          d. at Oulton (15 m. s.e. of Norwich), Suffolk, July 26, 1881.
          His boyhood was unsettled, his father, a soldier, moving about
          the country with his regiment. In 1819 he was articled to a
          solicitor at Norwich, but abandoned the work, went to London,
          and lived as a hack writer for the publishers. Then he took to
          wandering about England, and visited France, Spain, and Italy.
          In 1833 he was sent by the British and Foreign Bible Society to
          St. Petersburg to superintend the publication of a Manchu
          translation of the New Testament (published in eight volumes,
          1835); he continued in the service of the Society, most of the
          time in Spain, till 1840. Then he married and adopted a more
          settled life in England. He had much aptitude for languages and
          acquired a knowledge, though not scientific, of many tongues,
          being particularly noted for his acquaintance with the Romany,
          the dialect of the Gipsies, with whom he associated much both on
          his wanderings and after his return to England. He published a
          Romany word-book (London, 1874), translations, and romances
          which tell the story of his life with more or less fiction
          interwoven. He edited a translation of the New Testament into
          Spanish (Madrid, 1837) and translated the Gospel of Luke into
          the dialect of tile Gitanos (Spanish Gipsies; 1837) and into
          Basque (1838). Complete editions of his works were published in
          five volumes in London and New York. The best known of them are
          The Zincali; or an Account of the Gipsies in Spain (2 vols.,
          London, 1841) and The Bible in Spain (3 vols., 1843).

   Boschi, Giulio
          BOSCHI, bos'kî, GIULIO: Cardinal; b. at Perugia, Italy, Mar. 2,
          1838. He was educated in his native city and completed his
          studies at Rome, where he became the secretary of Cardinal Pecci
          (afterward Pope Leo XIII) in 1861. In 1888 he was consecrated
          bishop of Todi, and seven years later was translated to the see
          of Sinigaglia. In 1900 he was elevated to the archbishopric of
          Ferrara, and in the following year was created cardinal priest
          of S. Lorenzo in Panisperna.

   Bosnia and Herzegovina
          BOSNIA AND HERZEGOVINA: Two provinces of the Austro-Hungarian
          monarchy. Previous to the Treaty of Berlin (1878) they formed
          the extreme northwestern part of Turkey in Europe, but since
          1908 they have been part of Austria. Bosnia has the Hungarian
          and Austrian provinces of Croatia, Slavonia, and Dalmatia on the
          north and west, Servia to the east, and to the south
          Herzegovina, which is bounded on the east by Montenegro and on
          the south and west by Dalmatia. The capital is Sarajevo in
          Bosnia, the chief town and former capital of Herzegovina,
          Mostar. The area is about 16,200 and 3,500 miles respectively;
          the population (1896) 1,591,036, of whom 219,511 are credited to
          Herzegovina. The natives are nearly all Slavs of the Servian
          branch. The number of foreigners living in the land is estimated
          at 71,000, most of them having entered the country since the
          Austrian occupation.

          The religious statistics for 1895 were as follows:
          Greek-Orientals, 673,246 (43 per cent.); Mohammedans, 548,632
          (35 per cent.); Roman Catholics, 334,142 (21 per cent.); Jews,
          8,213; other religions (mostly Protestants), 3,859. The
          Mohammedans, in the main converts from Christianity since the
          Turkish conquest in the fifteenth century, are not of the most
          rigid kind, although they made a brave stand against the
          Austrian government. They are the landed proprietors of the
          country and merchants in the towns. They are under the Sheik ul
          Islam in Constantinople and a Rais al Ulama in Sarajevo. They
          have a large endowment fund for mosques, schools, hospitals, and
          the like, which is now administered under government
          supervision. The free exercise of their religion is guaranteed
          to them. The Roman Catholics are descendants of the older
          population and constitute the larger number of the artisans in
          the cities and the farmers. They are most numerous in the
          districts of Travnik and Mostar. The Franciscans have been
          active among them since the thirteenth century and have done
          much for them. Their condition has much improved since the
          Austrian occupation. There is an archbishop of Bosnia, who since
          1881 has resided at Sarajevo, and there are suffragan bishops of
          Banjaluka, Mostar and Duvno, and Marcana and Trebinje. The
          provincial seminary is at Banjaluka, where there are also four
          schools for boys and four for girls and an orphan asylum under
          the charge of Trappist monks. The adherents of the Greek Church
          are under the patriarch of Constantinople and the metropolitans
          of Sarajevo, Dolnja Tuzla, and Mostar. They are most numerous in
          the north, are farmers and traders, and are inferior to both the
          Latins and Mohammedans in education. Less than ten per cent. of
          the entire population can read or write, and the church schools
          are poor. Public schools are being established and there are
          three higher schools (two gymnasia and a Realschule), ten trade
          schools, and a normal school.

   Boso
          BOSO: Third English cardinal; d. after 1178. His name was Boso
          Breakspear and he was a nephew of Pope Adrian IV (Nicholas
          Breakspear). He belonged to the Benedictine monastery of St.
          Albans, but went to Rome probably under Eugenius III. From Nov.
          6, 1149, to May 3, 1152, he calls himself Romanæ ecclesiæ
          scriptor. Adrian IV made him his chamberlain early in his
          pontificate, probably therefore in 1154, and later made him
          cardinal deacon of Sts. Cosmas and Damian; under Alexander III
          he became cardinal priest of St. Pudentiana. With the latter
          title his signature appears to a number of papal bulls from
          March 18, 1166, to July 10, 1178, soon after which he appears to
          have died. He was a strong supporter of the policy of Adrian and
          Alexander. He wrote nine poetical lives of female saints, which
          are still in manuscript and was a poet of considerable merit.

          Pontificalis.

   Bosse, Friedrich
          BOSSE, FRIEDRICH: German Lutheran; b. at Rossla (38 m. w. of
          Halle) Aug. 23, 1864. He was educated at the universities of
          Tübingen, Berlin (Ph.D., 1886), Marburg, Heidelberg, and
          Greifswald, completing his studies in 1890. In the following
          year he became privat-docent at the University of Greifswald,
          and from 1892 to 1894 was provisional professor in Königsberg.
          In the latter year he was appointed associate professor of
          church history at Kiel, and five years later returned in a
          similar capacity to Greifswald, where he still remains. He has
          written Prolegomena zu einer Geschichte des Begriffes "Nachfolge
          Christi" (Berlin, 1895).

   Bossuet, Jacques Bénigne
          BOSSUET, bos´´sü´´ê´, JACQUES BÉNIGNE: Bishop of Meaux (about 27
          m. e.n.e. of Paris); b. at Dijon Sept. 27, 1627; d. in Paris
          Apr. 12, 1704. He began his studies in the Jesuit school of
          Dijon, and finished at the College de Navarre, Paris. He became
          priest and doctor of theology, 1652; after some time spent in
          retirement at St. Lazare, he went to Metz, where he was canon
          and archdeacon, acquired great fame as a preacher, and engaged
          in controversy with representatives of the Reformed Churches. At
          the request of his bishop he published his first work (1655), a
          Réfutation of the catechism of [485]Paul Ferry. In 1669 he was
          made bishop of Condom, Gascony, but resigned this office after
          he was appointed tutor to the dauphin (1670). When the education
          of his pupil was finished, in 1681, he was made bishop of Meaux.
          Bossuet adopted the Cartesian philosophy, to which he added the
          Thomist theology and a great admiration for Augustine. He is
          generally considered the foremost of French preachers; and, in
          so far as the art of eloquence is concerned, his six Oraisons
          funèbres (best collected eds., by Lequeux, Paris, 1762, and,
          with notes, etc., by A. Gasté, 1883) must be ranked among the
          finest specimens of Christian oratory, though they reflect the
          splendor and greatness of Louis Quatorze more vividly than the
          power and humility of the Gospel. As tutor to the dauphin he
          wrote De la connaissance de Dieu et de soi-même (1722; better
          ed., 1741) and Discours sur l'histoire universelle depuis le
          commencement du monde jusqu'ô l'empire de Charlemagne (1681; 5th
          ed., enlarged, 1703; the continuation to 1661, published 1806,
          was printed from his notes), the latter of which is a strikingly
          original attempt to construct a Christian philosophy of history
          on the principle that the destinies of nations are controlled by
          providence in the interest of the Roman Catholic Church. Among
          his controversial writings against the Protestants, the two most
          remarkable are Exposition de la doctrine de l'Église catholique
          sur les matières de controverse (1671) and Histoire des
          variations des Églises protestantes (2 vols., 1688; best ed., 4
          vols., 1689). The latter was sharply criticized by Jurieu and
          Basnage, and involved its author in a long and vehement
          controversy. He characterized the revocation of the Edict of
          Nantes (1685) as "le plus bel usage de l'autorité," but he was
          no ultramontanist. He presided in 1682 over the assembly of the
          French clergy which the king had convened to defend the royal
          prerogatives and the liberties of the Gallican Church against
          the claims of the pope. Nor was he in the least tainted by
          mysticism. His attacks on Fénelon and the Quietists approached
          very near to persecution. He was one of the greatest of the many
          distinguished men who lent brilliancy to the century of Louis
          XIV, but he was a representative of his time, and his ideas of
          church polity corresponded to, if they were not dictated by, the
          king's "l'état, c'est moi."

   Bost, Paul Ami Isaac David
          BOST, PAUL AMI ISAAC DAVID: Swiss evangelist; b. at Geneva June
          10, 1790; d. at La Force (6 m. w. of Bergerac), France, Dec. 14,
          1874. He devoted four years to theology at the University of
          Geneva, but gained little spiritual profit from his studies, and
          was ordained in 1814 in a spirit of empty formalism. In 1816 he
          accepted a call as assistant pastor at Moutiers-Granval in the
          Canton of Bern, where he remained two years, ascribing to this
          period his firm belief in the doctrines of grace and
          justification. A parish proved too small for his energies,
          however, and in 1818, under the auspices of the "London
          Continental Society," he began the missionary journeys which
          were to occupy almost thirty-five years of his life. After the
          first of these trips, he withdrew from the Church of Geneva, and
          in the following year was in Colmar. He was expelled from
          France, however, and began a roving life, oppressed by poverty
          and burdened with a large family, yet preaching in Offenbach,
          Frankfort, Hanau, Friedrichsdorf, and Carlsruhe.

          In 1825-26 Bost was in Geneva as the pastor of the free church
          of Bourg-de-Four. In answer to the attacks of the State Church,
          he published his Défense de ceux des fidèles de Genève qui se
          sont constitués en églises indépendantes (Geneva, 1825),
          charging the national Church with abandoning the Gospel and
          adopting Arianism. He was accordingly tried for slander, but was
          acquitted, although he was fined 500 francs for his libelous
          statements regarding the "Compagnie des pasteurs." Despite the
          fact that this trial marked a union of the divergent elements of
          the Free Church, Bost resigned his pastorate at Bourg-de-Four
          and founded a new congregation at Carouge near Geneva, which he
          dissolved after two years in favor of a more diversified
          activity, establishing the religious and political magazine
          L'Espérance in 1838. Two years later he successfully sought
          readmission to the clergy of Geneva, without retracting any of
          his views. After a brief pastorate at Asnières and Bourges in
          France, he was appointed chaplain of the prison of the Maison
          Centrale at Melun, where he remained until 1848, then living
          successively at Geneva, Nîmes, Neuchâtel, Jersey, and Paris, and
          spending his last years at La Force. The chief works of Bost,
          who also gained a certain amount of reputation as a writer of
          hymns, are as follows: Genève religieuse (Geneva, 1819);
          Histoire des frères moraves (2 vols., 1831; abridged Eng.
          transl., London, 1834); Sur la primauté de Pierre et son
          Épiscopat (3 pamphlets, 1832); Histoire générale de
          l'établissement du Christianisme (a revised translation of
          Blumhardt's Versuch einer allgemeinen Missionsgeschichte der
          Kirche Christi, 4 vols., Valence, 1838); Les propètes
          protestants (Melun, 1847); and Mémoires pouvant servir à
          l'histoire du réveil religieux (Paris, 1854-55).

   Boston, Thomas
          BOSTON, THOMAS: Church of Scotland; b. at Dunse (13 m. w. of
          Berwick-upon-Tweed), Berwickshire, Mar. 17, 1677; d. at Ettrick
          (40 m. s. of Edinburgh), Selkirkshire, May 20, 1732. He studied
          at the University of Edinburgh; became minister at Simprin,
          Berwickshire, 1699; at Ettrick, 1707. By circulating the Marrow
          of Modern Divinity among his friends he started the [486]Marrow
          Controversy. He wrote much and has exercised great influence in
          the Presbyterian Churches both of Scotland and England. The
          works by which he is now best known are Human Nature in its
          Fourfold State of Primitive Integrity, Entire Depravation, Begun
          Recovery, and Consummate Happiness or Misery (Edinburgh, 1720),
          commonly called "Boston's Fourfold State"; The Sovereignty and
          Wisdom of God Displayed in the Afflictions of Men (1737;
          reprinted as The Crook in the Lot, with memoir, Glasgow, 1863).
          He left an autobiography published as Memoirs (Edinburgh, 1776;
          ed. G. H. Morrison, 1899), and printed from Boston's manuscript,
          with introduction, notes, and bibliography by G. L. Low, under
          the title General Account of my Life (Edinburgh, 1907). His
          Whole Works edited by S. McMillan were published in twelve
          volumes at Aberdeen in 1848-52.

   Bottome, Margaret (McDonald)
          BOTTOME, MARGARET (McDONALD): Founder of the King's Daughters;
          b. in New York City Dec. 29, 1827; d. there Nov. 14, 1906. She
          was educated at a private school in Brooklyn, and in 1850
          married the Rev. Frank Bottome. She had already become
          interested in religious and philanthropic work, and in 1876
          began to give Bible talks in the homes of prominent New York
          women, continuing them for twenty-five years. In 1886 she
          organized the order of King's Daughters, basing her system on
          Edward Everett Hale's Ten Times One is Ten. In the following
          year the society was enlarged to include men, and the name was
          changed to the present International Order of the King's
          Daughters and Sons. In 1896 she was elected president of the
          women's branch of the International Medical Mission. She was
          also an associate editor of the The Ladies' Home Journal, and in
          addition to a few pamphlets and a large number of contributions
          to religious magazines wrote The Guest Chamber (New York, 1893);
          Crumbs from the King's Table (1894); and A Sunshine Trip to the
          Orient (1897).

          philanthropist; b. at Philadelphia May 2, 1740; d. at
          Burlington, N. J., Oct. 24, 1821. He was a lawyer and eminent in
          his profession; represented New Jersey in the Continental
          Congress 1778-79 and 1781-84, was chosen president in 1782, and,
          as such, signed the treaty of peace with Great Britain; he was
          member of the first three national congresses, and director of
          the United States mint 1795-1805. He was a member of the
          American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions (1812-21),
          and first president of the American Bible Society (1816-21). He
          was wealthy and gave liberally for philanthropic purposes during
          his life and in his will. He wrote The Age of Revelation; or the
          age of reason shown to be an age of infidelity (Philadelphia,
          1801), in reply to Thomas Paine; The Second Advent or Coming of
          the Messiah in Glory shown to be a scriptural doctrine and
          taught by divine revelation (Trenton, N. J., 1815); and A Star
          in the West; or a humble attempt to discover the long lost
          tribes of Israel (1816), in which he advocated the view that the
          American Indians are the ten lost tribes. He also published
          anonymously in the Evangelical Intelligencer for 1806 a memoir
          of William Tennent (reprinted New York, 1847). His Journal or
          Historical Recollections of American Events during the
          Revolutionary War was printed at Philadelphia in 1894.

   Bouhours, Dominique
          BOUHOURS, bu´´hur´, DOMINIQUE: Jesuit; b. in Paris May 15, 1628;
          d. there May 27, 1702. He entered the Society of Jesus at
          sixteen, and acquired such renown as a teacher that the young
          Longueville princes and the son of Colbert were put under his
          care. Besides a number of biographical and other works, he made
          (with two other Jesuits, Tellier and Bernier) a translation of
          the New Testament from the Vulgate into French (Paris,
          1697-1703).

   Bouquet, Martin
          BOUQUET, bu´´kê´, MARTIN: Benedictine of St. Maur; b. at Amiens
          Aug. 6, 1685, d. in Paris Apr. 6, 1754. He entered the
          Benedictine order at St. Faron, Meaux, in 1706, and was ordained
          priest. His knowledge of Hebrew and Greek secured his
          appointment as special assistant to Montfaucon in his editorial
          labors. When the great edition of the Scriptores rerum
          Gallicarum et Francicarum came to be made (it had been projected
          by Colbert as early as 1676, and was entrusted to the
          Benedictines of St. Maur in 1723), he was placed in charge of
          it. Difficulties were encountered owing to his opposition to the
          bull Unigenitus, which caused the king to banish him from Paris;
          but he succeeded in preparing the first eight volumes for
          publication (1738-52). Other members of the congregation brought
          out five more after his death (1757-86). Interrupted by the
          Revolution, the work was taken up again by the Institute, and
          later by the Academy of Inscriptions, by whom ten more volumes
          were published in the nineteenth century.

   Bouquin, Pierre (Petrus Boquinus)
          BOUQUIN, bu´´kaå´, PIERRE (PETRUS BOQUINUS): French Calvinist;
          b. either in the province of Saintonge or in that of Guienne; d.
          at Lausanne 1582. The first certain date in his life is his
          taking the degree of doctor of theology at the university of
          Bourges Apr. 23, 1539. He was a Carmelite monk at Bourges and
          rose to be prior; but, embracing the Reformation, he left his
          monastery in 1541 and went first to Basel, then to Leipsic and
          Wittenberg, where he had letters to Luther and Melanchthon. The
          latter recommended him to Butzer when a theologian was required
          to continue the lectures which Calvin had delivered in
          Strasburg. Here he began to lecture on Galatians in September,
          1542. Later he returned to Bourges, where he lectured on Hebrew
          and the Scriptures, gaining protection and a pension from
          Margaret of Navarre, and being allowed by the archbishop to
          preach in the cathedral. The Protestant leaders, Calvin, Farel,
          and Beza, seem to have suspected him of intending to desert the
          Reformation; but his teaching brought him again into conflict
          with the Roman authorities, and he left Bourges once more for
          Strasburg in 1555. Here he remained until the elector Otto Henry
          appointed him in 1557 to a provisional professorship in the
          University of Heidelberg, which was made permanent the next
          year. In the internal dissensions of Protestantism he took an
          increasingly decided Calvinistic stand, and in the reign of
          Frederick III was thus the only Heidelberg theologian to retain
          his position, and was made head of the faculty and a member of
          the new Reformed church council (1560). This period of
          prosperity ended, however, with the death of Frederick III,
          after which he was deprived of his position (1577), and became,
          a year later, professor and preacher at Lausanne. His numerous
          works are mainly polemical treatises against the Lutherans and
          Roman Catholics.

          Aug. 20, 1632; d. in Paris May 13,1704. He was for some time a
          teacher in literature and philosophy; in 1665 he was sent to
          preach in the provinces, in 1669 was recalled to Paris; after
          the revocation of the Edict of Nantes, he was sent to Languedoc
          to preach to the Protestants; his last years he devoted to the
          service of the poor and unfortunate in Paris. As a man he was
          justly esteemed and loved; as a preacher his strength is in the
          clearness of his argument, its readiness and its cogency. The
          first edition of his works was edited by Bretonneau (16 vols.,
          Paris, 1707-34); a good recent edition is that of Lille, 1882 (6
          vols.).

   Bourignon, de la Porte, Antoinette
          BOURIGNON, bu´´rî´´nyen´, DE LA PORTE, ANTOINETTE: Fanatical
          enthusiast; b. at Ryssel (Lille), then in the Spanish
          Netherlands, Jan. 13, 1616; d. at Franeker, Friesland, Oct. 30,
          1680. She grew up neglected and solitary on account of a facial
          deformity, afterward removed by an operation, and came to love
          isolation and communion with God. For a time her older sister
          drew her into the world; but she shrank from marriage, and once
          thought she heard the voice of God asking her, "Canst thou find
          a lover more perfect than I?" She thought of becoming a
          Carmelite, but concluded that the true Christians were not to be
          found in the cloisters, and sought another way to leave the
          world. Her father tried to force a marriage upon her in 1636;
          she fled in a male disguise, and after many romantic adventures
          was brought home, but took refuge at Mons under the protection
          of the archbishop. When her plans for founding an ascetic
          community on a primitive model were hindered, she went to Liége
          and made another unsuccessful attempt. On her father's death she
          brought suit against her stepmother for his entire property and
          won it. Now she fell under the influence of a doubtful friend of
          mysticism, Jean de St. Saulieu, who induced her to take charge
          of a home for orphan girls (1653), which she put under the
          Augustinian rule and made cloistered (1658). Her rule there came
          to an untoward end in 1662, when she took flight under serious
          accusations of cruelty. She went first to Ghent and then to
          Mechlin, where she found an adherent in the superior of the
          Oratorians, Christian de Cort. Soon she developed a fantastical
          system, based on alleged revelations. As the "woman clothed with
          the sun" of the Apocalypse, she was to revive the teachings of
          the Gospel and gather her spiritual children around her into a
          communistic, priestless brotherhood; she was the second
          revelation of the Son of Man on earth.

          The books which Antoinette now began to publish contain the
          bitterest condemnation of the Roman Catholic Church, reject
          infant baptism, and the Trinity was exchanged for a sacred triad
          of truth, mercy, and justice. She had dealings with the
          Jansenists, but rejected their teaching on predestination. In
          1667, with De Cort, she went to Amsterdam and lived for a while
          in the happy exchange of views with the most various heretics
          and fanatics. The following years are occupied with the history
          of the attempt to find a home for her elect on the island of
          Nordstrand in the North Sea, which De Cort had discovered as the
          destined place. His financial troubles, which make up a large
          part of the story, ended only with his imprisonment at Amsterdam
          and his death in 1669. Antoinette, as his heir, was for several
          years more much occupied with courts of justice, not without
          danger of imprisonment, and went from Amsterdam to Haarlem,
          thence to Sleswick, and finally to Husum to be as near as
          possible to Nordstrand. Here she might have been left in peace
          if she would have given up her claims. But she set up a
          printing-press and carried on the liveliest literary
          controversy, until her press was confiscated by the government.
          So her story proceeds, amid quaint and vivid details too
          numerous to give here, until she is found at Hamburg in 1679
          formally charged with sorcery by a former adherent, an eccentric
          colonel of artillery named La Coste. She fled to escape arrest,
          and remained in hiding until her death the next year. The points
          of her quietistic mysticism need no discussion; for herself the
          important one was her own position as bride of the Holy Ghost
          and channel of revelation. Though she was probably more of an
          adventuress than even an enthusiast or an insane woman, the
          solemn prophetic tone of her visions and divine messages
          continued for some time to attract readers who believed in her
          inspiration; but her community seems to have been entirely
          scattered at her death.

          (G. Kawerau.)

          Antoinette had many followers in Scotland, more, it is said,
          than in any other country. Prominent among them were the Rev.
          James Garden (1647-1726), who rose to be professor of divinity
          at King's College, Aberdeen, and was deprived in 1696 because he
          had refused to sign the Westminster Confession of Faith, and his
          younger brother, Rev. George Garden (1649-1733), who after being
          one of the ministers of St. Nicholas, the town parish of
          Aberdeen, was "laid aside" by the privy council in 1692 because
          he refused to pray for William and Mary and in 1701 was deposed
          from the ministry because he had advocated Bourignonianism in
          his book, An Apology for M. Antonia Bourignon (1699), a reply to
          books by his brother-in-law, the Rev. John Cockburn (1652-1729),
          entitled Bourignianism Detected; or, the Delusions and Errors of
          A. Bourignon and her Growing Sect. Narrative i. (London, 1698),
          Narrative ii. (1698), and A Letter to his Friend giving an
          account why the other Narratives about Bourignianism are not yet
          published, and answering some Reflections passed upon the first
          (1698).

          The General Assembly of the Church of Scotland in 1701, 1709,
          and 1710 passed deliverances against Bourignonians in which
          their views are thus described: I. They denied (1) the divine
          permission of sin and that divine vengeance and eternal
          damnation were inflicted upon it; (2) the decrees of election
          and reprobation; and (3) the doctrine of the divine
          foreknowledge. II. They asserted (1) that Christ had a twofold
          human nature, one produced of Adam before the woman was formed,
          and the other born of the Virgin Mary; (2) that in each soul
          before birth are a good and an evil spirit; (3) that the will is
          absolutely free, and there is in man some infinite quality which
          makes it possible for him to unite himself to God; (4) that
          Christ's nature was sinfully corrupt, so that by nature he was
          rebellious to the will of God; (5) that perfection may be
          attained in this life; and (6) that children are born in heaven.

          Notwithstanding these deliverances, the views of Antoinette
          Bourignon continued to exist in Scotland and in 1711
          Bourignonianism was put among the heresies which candidates for
          the ministry were required formally to disown when applying for
          ordination.

          Bibliography: An edition of the works of Antoinette Bourignon
          was published in 19 vols., at Amsterdam, 1680-86. She wrote two
          accounts of her life: La Parole de Dieu, ou sa vie intérieure
          (1634-63), Mechlin, 1663; and La Vie extérieure (1616-61),
          Amsterdam, 1668. These were continued by her disciple, Pierre
          Poiret, in Sa vie continuée, reprise depuis sa naissance et
          suivie jusqu'à sa mort, appended to a later edition of the
          preceding. Her autobiography in Eng. transl. under the title The
          Light of the World; a Most True Relation of a Pilgrimess

          following year was consecrated titular bishop of Epiphania and
          coadjutor to the bishop of Southwark. He was bishop of Southwark
          from 1897 to 1903, and since the latter year has been archbishop
          of Westminster. He practically refounded St. John's Seminary at
          Wonersh, and has been most active in movements for social reform
          in the diocese of Southwark. He represented the Roman Catholics
          of England at the St. Augustine celebrations at Arles in 1897,
          as well as the English Roman Catholic bishops at Autun in 1899,
          and led the English pilgrims to Lourdes in 1902.

          1888. He was graduated at Union Theological Seminary, New York
          City, in 1847; was ordained by the presbytery of New York, and
          the same year went to Bombay under the American Board. He spent
          the rest of his life in that city, but severed his connection
          with the American Board in 1855 and was an independent
          missionary till 1872 when he connected himself with the
          Methodist Episcopal missionary society. He edited the Bombay
          Guardian from 1854 on; and was also the secretary of the
          Religious Tract Society of Bombay. By the volumes which have
          been made up from his writings he has helped many spiritually.
          They are: Daily Meditations (Philadelphia, 1865); Discussions by
          the Seaside (Bombay, 1857); Love revealed. Meditations on the
          parting words of Jesus with his disciples in John xiii. to xvii.

          He was a member and examiner of the American Institute of Sacred
          Literature in 1889-93, as well as secretary and librarian of the
          Stewart Missionary Foundation for Africa. He was likewise a
          member of the general conferences of 1896, 1900, and 1904, and
          from 1892 to 1900 was a member of the board of control of the
          Epworth League. He is the editor of The Voice, The Negro, and
          the Stewart Missionary Magazine, and has written National
          Sermons, Africa and the American Negro (Philadelphia, 1891);
          University Addresses (Atlanta, 1895); Discussions in Philosophy
          and Theology (1895); and The United Negro (1902).

   Bower, Archibald
          BOWER, ARCHIBALD: Professed convert from Roman Catholicism to
          Protestantism; b. at Dundee Jan. 17, 1686; d. in London Sept. 3,
          1766. He was educated at Douai, went to Italy, became a Jesuit
          1706, and in 1723 was made a counselor of the Inquisition at
          Macerata, Italy. In 1726 he fled secretly to England, and, after
          some years, joined the Established Church; he gained influential
          patrons, who procured him employment in literary work and
          teaching. In 1745 he was readmitted into the Society of Jesus,
          but, after two years, again professed to leave the Church of
          Rome. His principal publication was the History o/ the Popes (7
          vols., London, 1748-66; reprinted with a continuation by S. H.
          Cox, 3 vols., Philadelphia, 1844-45), which was attacked by
          Alban Butler and John Douglas as a mere translation of Tillemont
          and earlier writers without proper acknowledgment. Bower's
          character for virtue as well as veracity is not above suspicion.

          Bibliography: The DNB, vi, 48-51, furnishes a succinct account
          of his life and the charges against him, with a list of
          literature upon him.

   Bowman, Thomas
          BOWMAN, THOMAS: The name of two contemporary American bishops.

          1. Methodist Episcopal bishop; b. at Berwick, Pa., July 15,
          1817. He was educated at Dickinson College (B.A., 1837), and two
          years later entered the Baltimore conference of the Methodist
          ministry. He taught in the grammar-school of Dickinson College
          in 1840-43, and five years later founded Dickinson Seminary,
          Williamsport, Pa., of which he was the president until 1858,
          when he was chosen president of Asbury (now De Pauw) University,
          Greencastle, Ind. In 1864-1865 he was also chaplain of the
          United States Senate. He resigned the presidency of Asbury
          University in 1872, when he was elected bishop, and since that
          time has officially visited all the conferences of his
          denomination in the United States, Europe, India, China, Japan,
          and Mexico.

          2. Bishop of the Evangelical Association; b. in Lehigh township,
          Northampton County, Pa., May 28, 1836. He studied at the
          Vanderveers Seminary, Easton, Pa., and entered the ministry of
          the Evangelical Association. He was pastor in the eastern
          Pennsylvania conference 1859-75, and was presiding elder of the
          same conference 1870-75. He has been a bishop since 1875, and
          since 1896 principal of the Union Biblical Institute at
          Narpersville, Ill., which is the theological seminary of the
          Evangelical Association. He characterizes his theological
          position as "Arminian-evangelical." He has published a revision
          of the catechism of his Church, also an account of the
          disturbance in the Evangelical Association.

   Bowring, Sir John
          BOWRING, SIR JOHN: English Unitarian; b. at Exeter Oct. 17,
          1792; d. there Nov. 23, 1872. He served his country as member of
          Parliament (1835-37 and 1841-49), in the public service in China
          and the Far East (1849-59), and as member of various
          governmental commissions; he was an ardent Utilitarian and first
          editor of the Westminster Review (1825). He was a remarkable
          linguist and an enthusiastic student of literature. His writings
          relate to public affairs, give the results of his travels, and
          include numerous translations, particularly of the popular
          poetry of Eastern Europe; he edited the works of Jeremy Bentham
          with biography (11 vols., London, 1838-43). He is mentioned here
          for his hymns, many of which are in general use, as "God is
          love, his mercy brightens," "From the recesses of a lowly
          spirit," "In the cross of Christ I glory," "Watchman, tell us of
          the night," "We can not always trace the way," and others.

   Boy-Bishop
          BOY-BISHOP: A popular custom of the Middle Ages to provide a
          diversion for the boys of a church or cathedral choir or school,
          and to reward the most deserving. One of the number was chosen
          "bishop," most commonly on St. Nicholas's day (Dec. 6), and in
          episcopal dress and attended by his fellows as priests, he went
          through the streets bestowing his blessing. Often he entered
          into the church and conducted some part of the service, at times
          delivering a sermon, prepared for the purpose by an older head
          (cf. the Concio de puero Jesu of Erasmus, edited by S. Bentley,
          London, 1816, which was spoken by a boy of St. Paul's School,
          London, on such an occasion). The boys occupied the seats of the
          clergy while the latter sat in the lowest places. In some
          localities the game lasted from St. Nicholas's day until Holy
          Innocents' day (Dec. 28). It was very popular in England, where
          it was observed not only in the churches and schools, but at the
          court and in the castles of the nobility; the boys were called
          "St. Nicholas's clerks." The custom was forbidden in 1542 but
          was restored under Mary. It was also common in France, although
          repeatedly forbidden there (by the papal legate, 1198; the
          synods of Paris 1212, Cognac 1260, Nantes 1431; the chapter of
          Troyes 1445). In some places, as Reims and Mainz, it lasted till
          the eighteenth century. See [489]Fools, Feast of, and consult
          the works mentioned in the bibliography of that article.

   Boyce, James Petigru
          BOYCE, JAMES PETIGRU: American Baptist; b. at Charleston, S. C.,
          Jan. 11, 1827; d. at Pau, France, Dec. 28, 1888. He was
          graduated at Brown University 1847; studied theology at
          Princeton Theological Seminary, 1849-51; became pastor of the
          Baptist church at Columbia, S. C., 1851; professor of theology
          in Furman University, Greenville, S. C., 1855; chairman of the
          faculty, and professor of systematic theology in the Southern
          Baptist Theological Seminary, opened at the same place in 1859.
          He was opposed to secession, but went with his State into the
          Civil War; was chaplain of the Sixteenth South Carolina
          volunteers 1861-62; member of the legislature 1862-65; of the
          State council and on the staff of Gov. A. G. Magrath 1864-65;
          member of the State convention for reconstruction 1865. At the
          close of the war he returned to his duties in the seminary,
          reopened it and reestablished it with much labor, and made
          considerable contributions to its support from his own means. In
          1872 he was transferred to the chair of church government and
          pastoral duties, but was absent much of the time for the next
          few years arranging for the removal of the seminary to
          Louisville, Ky., which was accomplished in 1877. In 1887 he
          returned to his old department of systematic theology. He was
          president of the Southern Baptist Convention 1872-79 and in
          1888. Besides sermons, speeches, and articles he published Three
          Changes in Theological Education (Greenville, 1856); A Brief
          Catechism of Bible Doctrine (Memphis, 1872); An Abstract of
          Theology (Louisville, 1882; rev. and enlarged ed., Baltimore,
          1887; rev. and annotated by F. H. Kerfoot, Philadelphia, 1898).

          (over the signature A. K. H. B., and the sobriquet "The Country
          Parson"), and was perhaps the most widely known minister of the
          Scottish Church. In 1866 he was made chairman of a committee to
          prepare a new collection of hymns and filled the place with much
          judgment and tact. He was moderator of the General Assembly in
          1890. The most notable of his many books were Recreations of a
          Country Parson (3 series, London, 1859-78); Leisure Hours in
          Town (1862); Graver Thoughts of a Country Parson (3 series,

   Boyle, Robert, and the Boyle Lectures
          BOYLE, ROBERT, AND THE BOYLE LECTURES: Robert Boyle was born at
          Lismore Castle (30 m. n.e. of Cork), Waterford, Ireland, Jan.
          25, 1627, son of Richard Boyle, earl of Cork; d. in London Dec.
          30,1691. He studied at Eton and (1638-44) at Geneva and
          elsewhere on the Continent; on his return to England he lived at
          first on his estate, Stalbridge, Dorsetshire, after 1654 in
          Oxford, and after 1668 in London. As a scientist he holds a high
          rank and has been considered the heir to both the methods and
          abilities of Francis Bacon. He was one of the founders of the
          Royal Society (1662), and was constantly engaged in
          investigations which resulted in numerous publications. He wrote
          many theological, moral, and religious essays, gave freely for
          the translation of the Bible into various languages, and was
          liberal in private charity. He was governor of the Corporation
          for the Spread of the Gospel in New England (see [490]Eliot,
          John). In his will he left an endowment of £50 annually for the
          Boyle Lectures, a series of 8 sermons, to be delivered each year
          in some church, against unbelievers. For the lectures St. Paul's
          was used in 1699 and 1701, the pariah church of St. Mary le Bow
          1711-1805, Westminster Abbey 1852-53, the Chapel Royal,
          Whitehall, 1864-85, while the lectures of 1903-05 were delivered
          in the Church of St. Edmund, Lombard St. The first course was
          given by Richard Bentley (1692); his successors have included
          some of England's most prominent theologians. A selection from
          the sermons was published by Gilbert Burnet, vicar of
          Coggeshall, in 4 vols., London, 1737. A partial list of the
          published Boyle Lectures down to 1892-93 is given in J. F.
          Hurst, Literature of Theology (New York, 1896). Since then there
          have been published the lectures for 1895, W. C. E. Newbolt, The
          Gospel of Experience (London, 1896), and for 1903-05 by R. J.
          Knowling, The Testimony of St. Paul to Christ (London, 1905).

          Boyle's complete works with life were published by Thomas Birch
          (5 vols., London, 1744; 2d ed., 6 vols., 1772).

   Brace, Charles Loring
          BRACE, CHARLES LORING: American philanthropist; b. at
          Litchfield, Conn., June 19, 1826; d. at Campfer in the Engadine,
          Switzerland, Aug. 11, 1890. He was graduated at Yale 1846;
          studied at the Yale Divinity School 1847-48 and at Union
          Theological Seminary, New York, 1848-1849; traveled and studied
          in Europe for two years; in 1853 he became first secretary and
          executive agent of the Children's Aid Society of New York, and
          remained such till his death. He planned and developed the work
          and supported it in the earlier days with much self-sacrificing
          labor; industrial and night schools were established,
          lodging-houses provided for newsboys and for girls,
          reading-rooms opened, summer charities instituted, and nearly
          100,000 boys and girls were assisted to new homes and
          occupations with healthful and moral surroundings. By thus
          removing incipient criminals a marked diminution in juvenile
          crime was shown in the police reports of New York. The history
          of the work was given by Mr. Brace in his annual reports and in
          his two books, Short Sermons to Newsboys, with a history of the
          formation of the Newsboys' Lodging House (New York, 1866); and
          The Dangerous Classes of New York, and twenty years' work among
          them (1872; enlarged ed., 1880). He published several works of
          travel of a popular character such as Home Life in Germany
          (1853); The New West (1869); and as results of considerable
          thinking and study, Gesta Christi, a history of humane progress
          under Christianity (1882; 4th ed., 1884); and The Unknown God,
          or inspiration among pre-Christian races (1890).

   Bradford, John
          BRADFORD, JOHN: Church of England Protestant martyr; b. at
          Manchester about 1510; burned at Smithfield July 1, 1555. He was
          in the service of Sir John Harrington, the king's paymaster in
          France; began to study law in the Temple 1547, but the next year
          turned to divinity and entered St. Catherine's Hall, Cambridge
          (M.A., by special grace, 1549); was elected fellow of Pembroke
          Hall 1549; became prebendary of Kentish Town in the church of
          St. Paul, 1551; was chaplain to Bishop Ridley, in 1552 one of
          the king's six chaplains in ordinary, and preached in many
          localities with great fervor and earnestness. In August, 1553
          (six weeks after the accession of Mary), he was arrested on the
          charge of preaching seditious sermons and committed to the
          Tower; he was examined before Bishops Gardiner, Bonner, and
          others in January, 1555, and condemned as a heretic. His
          writings (chiefly sermons, letters, and devotional pieces) were
          edited for the Parker Society by Aubrey Townsend (2 vols.,

   Bradlaugh, Charles
          BRADLAUGH, CHARLES: English freethought advocate and politician;
          b. at Hoxton (a suburb of London) Sept. 26,1833; d. at London
          Jan. 30,1891. He was educated in local schools until the age of
          twelve, when his business life began. A few years later he
          became an advocate of freethought, and rapidly achieved
          notoriety for his propaganda. His attitude seriously affected
          his career, and at the age of seventeen he enlisted as a private
          soldier, remaining in the army three years. He then entered a
          solicitor's office, and soon rose to a position of
          responsibility. Meantime he had resumed his campaign for
          freethought, and in 1858 began a platform tour of the provinces,
          advocating not only radicalism in religion, but also in
          politics. From 1862 until his death, excepting in 1863-66, he
          was the proprietor of the republican National Reformer, and in
          his advocacy of radical politics was secretary of the fund
          raised in 1858 to defend E. Truelove for publishing a
          vindication of Orsini's attempt to assassinate Napoleon III. He
          was likewise a member of the parliamentary reform league of
          1866, and drew up the first draft of the Fenian proclamation
          issued in the following year, while three years later he was the
          envoy of the English republicans to the Spanish republican
          leader Castelar, and was likewise nominated as candidate for a
          division of Paris on the foundation of the French republic in
          the same year. He then attempted to go to Paris on the outbreak
          of the Commune to be an intermediary between Thiers and the
          insurrectionists, but was arrested at Calais and forced to
          return to England.

          In 1868 Bradlaugh's attempts to gain a seat in the House of
          Commons began, but his avowed principles caused his defeat both
          in that year and in 1874. Six years later, however, he was
          returned, and by his refusal to take the required oath on the
          Bible initiated a struggle which involved him in repeated scenes
          in the House of Commons and in eight legal actions. He was again
          and again excluded from the House, his willingness to take the
          oath as a mere matter of form, or to affirm, being overruled by
          the plea that he was an avowed freethinker. Nevertheless, he was
          reelected for Northampton by special elections after his
          expulsion in 1881 and 1882, and at the general election in 1886
          was once more returned, being permitted this time to take his
          seat, which he retained until his death. During this troubled
          period of his life he was also involved in a contest for the
          abolition of all restrictions on the press, beginning with his
          refusal, in 1868, to give security to the government against the
          publication of blasphemy and sedition in his National Reformer.
          In the following year another legal contest resulted in the
          passage of the Evidence Amendment Act, by which the evidence of
          freethinkers was declared admissible, a judge having refused to
          take his testimony on the ground that he was a freethinker. A
          few years later, in 1874, he became associated with [491]Annie
          Besant, who was assistant editor of the National Reformer until
          1885, when she resigned on account of his opposition to
          socialism. In 1876 they were sentenced to six months'
          imprisonment and a fine of £200 for the publication of the
          Fruits of Philosophy, which advocated the artificial restraint
          of the increase of population. The sentence was suspended,
          however, and the contest resulted in the passage of an act
          removing the remaining restrictions on the press.

          In Parliament Bradlaugh was active in securing the passage of a
          number of measures, of which the chief was one permitting the
          substitution of an affirmation for the oath both in the House of
          Commons and in the courts. In 1889 he visited India, and during
          his final illness the resolutions of his expulsion from the
          House of Commons were unanimously expunged. The writings of
          Bradlaugh were chiefly brief controversial pamphlets and
          contributions to the press. Among them the most important are
          The Impeachment of the House of Brunswick (London, 1872);
          Autobiography (1873); Land for the People (1877); The New Life
          of David (1877); Genesis, its Authorship and Authenticity
          (1882); and The True Story of my Parliamentary Struggle (1882).

          1821; d. in London Mar. 12, 1903. He studied at Rugby under
          Arnold (1837-40), and at University College, Oxford (B.A., 1844;
          M.A., 1847); was fellow of University College 1844-50; became
          assistant master at Rugby 1846; head master of Marlborough
          College, Wiltshire, 1858; master of University College, Oxford,
          1870; dean of Westminster, London, succeeding Arthur Penrhyn
          Stanley, 1881; resigned his deanery 1902. He edited and revised
          Arnold's Latin Prose Composition (London, 1881), and published
          Aids to Writing Latin Prose (1884); Recollections of Arthur
          Penrhyn Stanley (1883); Lectures on Ecclesiastes (Oxford, 1885;
          new ed., 1898); Lectures on the Book of Job (1887); and assisted

   Bradshaw, William
          BRADSHAW, WILLIAM: Puritan; b. at Market Bosworth (12 m. w. of
          Leicester), Leicestershire, 1571; d. at Chelsea 1618. He studied
          at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and became fellow of Sidney
          Sussex College in 1599; took orders but never received a living
          owing to his Puritan principles, and spent much of his time in
          retirement in Derbyshire, whence he made many journeys in behalf
          of the cause to which he was devoted. His chief work was English
          Puritanism: containing the main opinions of the rigid sort of
          those that are called Puritans in the Realm of England (London,
          1605; Latin transl., by William Ames, Frankfort, 1610; an
          abstract is given in Neal's History of the Puritans, part ii,
          chap. i). The main point of his system was that he would subject
          no congregation to any ecclesiastical jurisdiction "save that
          which is within itself." He would have the members delegate
          their powers to pastors and elders, retaining that of
          excommunication. No clergyman should hold civil office. He was
          strongly opposed to "ceremonies." He was not a separatist and
          held that the king as "the archbishop and general overseer of
          all the churches within his dominions" had the right to rule and
          must not be resisted except passively. He published many other
          works and tracts, most of them anonymously.

   Bradwardine, Thomas
          BRADWARDINE, THOMAS: Archbishop of Canterbury; b. probably at
          Chichester, Sussex, 1290; d. in London Aug. 28, 1349. His name
          is variously spelled (Bragwardin, Brandnardin, Bredwardyn,
          etc.), in public documents he is usually called Thomas de
          Bradwardina, and a title often given him is Doctor Profundus. He
          studied theology, philosophy, mathematics, and astronomy at
          Merton College, Oxford; lectured there; became chancellor of St.
          Paul's Church at London; in 1339 accompanied Edward III as his
          confessor in campaigns in France; in 1349 was chosen archbishop
          of Canterbury, was consecrated at Avignon and died a few weeks
          afterward. He was highly esteemed by Wyclif, Jean Gerson, and
          Flacius. He was the author of a large work entitled De causa Dei
          contra Pelagium [ed. Sir Henry Savile, London 1618], in which he
          attempted to show that the theology as well as the Church of his
          time were Pelagian. He gave the name Cainites to those who gave
          up hope in God and depended upon their own merits; his personal
          experience gave him a different conception: "In the schools of
          the philosophers I rarely heard a word concerning grace, . . .
          but I continually heard that we are the masters of our own free
          actions." Rom. ix, 16 had seemed to him to be wrong; "but
          afterward . . . I came to see that the grace of God far preceded
          all good works both in time and in nature--by grace I mean the
          will of God." Bradwardine wished to support this position on
          theoretical grounds. He acknowledged Augustine as his master.
          The sum of his teaching is as follows: God is complete
          perfection and goodness, is good action itself, free from the
          potentiality of imperfection. He is not limited by mentality. He
          is the first cause, the absolute principle of being and motion.
          Therefore, no one can act nor can anything "happen"; God works
          or orders events. Divine foreknowledge is will exercised long
          before, or predestination of [man's] will. God's will, moreover,
          is unchanging. Everything takes place by virtue of the immutable
          antecedent necessity caused by the divine volition. Hence man
          can say nothing "more useful or efficacious . . . than 'thy will
          be done.'" The effects of predestination are the gift of grace
          in the present, justification from sin, award of merit,
          perseverance to the end, and unending bliss in the world to
          come. The result of this line of thought is, of course,
          determinism of a Thomistic type. In spite of this theory,
          Bradwardine, like Augustine, asserted the reality of free will.
          His historical importance consists in the fact that he was one
          of the most powerful champions of the Augustinian movement which
          took place toward the end of the Middle Ages. This movement
          contributed to the dissolution of scholasticism and to a new
          understanding of Christian doctrine from the point of view of
          personal faith.

          The Rig-Veda (§ 2).

          The Six Orthodox Systems of Philosophy (§ 2).

          III. The Age of the Buddhistic and Jainistic Heresies.

          Brahmanism is the orthodox religion of India, the most ancient
          of all Indo-Germanic faiths of which there is record. In itself
          the most catholic and elastic of cults, its test is the
          recognition of the divine authority of the Vedas; its outward
          sign is reverence for the gods, some of whom are comparatively
          late and foreign in origin; and, for the Brahmans, its end is
          emancipation from the sorrow of existence and the misery of
          reincarnation through reabsorption into the divine essence of
          the All-Soul.

          Brahmanism may be divided into three periods: I. The Age of the
          Vedas and their Ancillary Literature; II. Brahmanism and the
          Pantheism of the Upanishads; III. The Age during which the
          Buddhistic and Jainistic Heresies Prevailed. The two phases
          which are included in the Brahmanistic counterreformation and
          rise of the Hindu sects, and modern Hinduism and the unitarian
          movements are treated under [493]Hinduism.

  I. Vedism, the Age of the Vedas and their Ancillary Literature (the Brahmanas
  and Sutras--the former a sort of Hindu Talmud; the latter brief verses in
  technical language, a favorite form of expressing rules):

    1. The People of the Vedas and their Gods.

          At a period of remote antiquity, possibly between 2000 and 1500
          B.C., a section of the Indo-Germanic peoples known by various
          names, of which the most common are Indians and Aryans, broke
          off from the kindred Iranian stock and wandered southward and
          eastward through Afghanistan into the Punjab or the "Five
          Waters," in the extreme northwest of the Indian peninsula. Like
          the Iranians of Persia, they were divided into the three classes
          of priests, warriors, and husbandmen, whence were to be formed
          later the three higher castes, and were a nomadic and
          agricultural people, filled with the joy of living, valiant in
          war, daring freebooters, hot in love and reveling in wine,
          almost everything, in short, that the later Hindus were not.
          Their gods were like themselves, concrete and strong: Surya, the
          bright deity of the sun; Indra, the blinding lightning which
          ushers in the rainy season; Agni, the god of fire; and Soma, the
          deified inspiration of strong drink and of the divine courage
          which it gives. Few are the deities which show the softer side
          of the early Aryan mind, such as Ushas, the goddess of the dawn,
          or Varuna, the god of the sky-ocean, who watches over all and
          even later in this period receives praises which almost savor of
          monotheism.

    2. The Rig-Veda.

          The beliefs of the Aryans of this period are contained in the
          Rig-Veda, a book of hymns, the earliest literary records of the
          Indo-Germanic race, to which the most probable date assigned is
          1500-500 B.C. This Veda is divided into ten books containing
          1,022 hymns. Books ii-vii form the "family books," composed by
          successive generations of families of bards. Book ix is
          restricted to the Soma hymns, while i and viii, and especially
          x, the latest of all, are more diverse in contents and
          authorship. Within this range of space and time are represented
          many phases of religious thought, ranging from crass polytheism
          through intricate henotheism or syncretism to a quasimonotheism,
          or rather pantheism; varying from earnest faith to incipient
          skepticism; touching, too, on daily life as well as on worship
          and sacrifice.

          It must not be supposed, however, that the faith of the Veda is
          naive or childlike. It is, on the contrary, quite developed and
          occasionally even corrupt. Many of the hymns were undoubtedly
          composed for the ritual, although it is scarcely possible to
          regard the entire collection as subservient to the liturgy.
          Untenable also is the theory of the French school which reduces
          the entire Rig-Veda to a mass of allegory, nor are the
          conclusions of the realistic school, which regards this Veda as
          entirely Indic and interprets it rationalistically, altogether
          free from criticism. To the elucidation of a collection so
          extended both in space and time no single method of
          interpretation is adequate. Naiveté and mature thought, liturgy
          and hymnology, allegory and realism must each be recognized as
          occasion demands, must even be combined at times to give a true
          representation of the Vedic Hinduism.

          The basis of the Vedic religion is nature-worship. Each element
          is deified, the fire as Agni, the dawn as Ushas, the sky as
          Varuna, and the lightning of the storm as Indra. A single object
          in nature may be represented by many gods, as when the sun is
          venerated under the names of Surya, " the glowing one"; Savitar,
          "the enlivener"; Bhaga, "the bestower of boons"; Pushan, "he who
          causeth to flourish"; and Vishnu, "the mighty one." While these
          names may represent the deity in different aspects, as do the
          Egyptian Ra and Tum, the gods of the rising and the setting sun,
          it must not be forgotten that variance in name and even in
          concept of the same divinity may have been in its origin mere
          local divergence in expression for one and the same god, for the
          Rig-Veda was composed by many minds, at many places, in many
          periods. Behind nature-worship doubtless lay the earlier phase
          of animism, although its traces are obscured in the Vedic texts.
          Still more scanty are the evidences of ancestor-worship, or the
          cult of ghosts, though this phase was perhaps rather officially
          ignored than popularly absent. The eschatology of the Rig-Veda
          is comparatively simple, and resembles in its meagerness the
          poverty of early Semitism as represented by the
          Assyro-Babylonian religion. Allusions to the future state of the
          dead are practically confined to the late tenth book. Yama, the
          first of men to die, is the king of the dead; and apparently the
          blessed, i.e., the brave and generous, go when they die to the
          sun, where they engage in revelry like that of the Norse heroes
          of Asgard. The unblessed dead merely disappear, for hell is, in
          Indian thought, a late theological invention, devised to
          counterbalance the joys of heaven. In the latest portion of the
          Rig-Veda, moreover, appear the chief hymns later rubricized in
          the ritual, if indeed they were not, at least in part,
          designedly composed for an already existing liturgy.

    3. The Sama- and Yajur-Vedas.

          Beside the Rig-Veda exist two other canonical Vedas, and a
          fourth which is uncanonical. The Sama or "Song" Veda is composed
          of verses taken chiefly from the eighth and ninth books of the
          Rig-Veda and arranged for the liturgy. Far more important is the
          Yajur or "Sacrificial" Veda, which exists in several recensions,
          the chief being the Vajasaneyi or "White" Yajur-Veda, so called
          from being composed only in verse, and the Taittirya and
          Maitrayani, which are termed "black," since the verse of the
          text is intermingled with a quasicommentary and amplification in
          prose.

          The arena implied is no longer the Punjab but the "middle
          district," around the modern Delhi, which the Aryans had reached
          in their slow migration eastward. The change of locality,
          however, is dwarfed into insignificance by the alteration in
          religious tone. The frank delight in life which characterizes
          the Rig-Veda is changed to mysticism and an ever-increasing
          ritualism. Religion has given place to magic. The principle of
          henotheism which is so marked a feature of the Rig-Veda, through
          which poetic enthusiasm comes to attribute to one divinity the
          names and attributes of another, thus elevating him for the
          nonce into the supreme and only object of adoration, becomes in
          the Yajur-Veda symbolism carried to its limit. A thing is no
          longer like something else, it is something else. The Brahman is
          no longer merely a priest, he is a god with all the attributes
          of divinity, while prayer and sacrifice are now means of
          compelling the deity to perform the will of his worshipers,
          instead of being modes of propitiation or bargaining. The
          religion of India now centers in the sacrifice, and a ritual is
          developed which is perhaps the most elaborate that the world has
          ever seen. While the power of the Brahmans was thereby increased
          until they were apotheosized, the view is antiquated which
          regards the development of the liturgy as the ecclesiastical
          device of a cunning and self-interested priesthood, despite the
          enormous fees which were given for the performance of sacrifice.

          The pantheon of this period suffers little diminution as
          compared with the epoch of the Rig Veda, but the gods have
          declined in power, although some have been greatly magnified,
          such as Kala (Time), who played no part in the earliest Veda.
          The epithets and the functions of the gods become separate
          divinities in many cases, and an All-God now gains the full
          recognition which is only suggested even in the latest portions
          of the Rig-Veda. The legends of the deities, on the other hand,
          are richly developed, though their quantity is more admirable
          than their quality. This, however, is a recrudescence of popular
          beliefs previously not officially recognized, rather than new
          speculations of the Brahmans, though this faith of the people
          finds its application in the explanation and proof of the
          sacrifice. The rules for the Brahmanic ritual are contained not
          only in the various recensions of the Yajur-Veda, but in the
          still more important Brahmanas, of which each school of each of
          the Vedas has at least one, while the Tandin recension of then
          Same-Veda has three. Additional details are contained in the
          Srautasutras, and the ritual for daily life may be found in the
          various Grihyasutras.

    4. The Atharva-Veda.

          Beside the three canonical Vedas and their ancillary literature,
          representing the official religion of the Vedic and Brahmanic
          periods, stood a Veda of magic--the uncanonical Atharva-Veda.
          The pantheon of the Rig-Veda is here a jumbled confusion of
          divinities, at their head a supreme god of all, while
          eschatology has so far developed as to recognize a place of
          torment for the malignant dead. The predominant note of the
          Atharva-Veda is magic. It is filled with all manner of charms
          and incantations for wealth and for children, for long life and
          good health, for love and for revenge, charms for plants,
          animals, and diseases, curses and maledictions for the
          destruction of enemies and for counteracting the enemy's black
          magic. Linguistically and chronologically far later than the
          Rig-Veda, the material of the Atharva-Veda is in all probability
          as old in some of its parts as the most ancient portions of the
          Rig. It is an invaluable document for early Hindu religion as
          the oldest monument of its popular faith.

  II. Brahmanism and the Pantheism of the Upanishads:

          The enormous structure of ritualism erected by the Yajur-Veda,
          the Brahmanas, and the Sutras gradually became a burden too
          heavy to be borne; liturgy was then undermined by philosophical
          speculation. Traces of this are already evident in the later
          portions of the Rig-Veda, as in the famous hymn (x, 121) whose
          refrain runs: "To whom (as) god shall we offer sacrifice?" thus
          affording a basis for the Brahmanas to create a god "Who." By
          this time, moreover, an All-God was definitely recognized in
          Prajapati, "the lord of creatures," but it was reserved for the
          close of the Brahmanic period to ignore the gods and arrive at
          God.

    1. The Upanishads.

          The Upanishads, the literary records of this phase of thought,
          represent a perfection of pantheism which has never been
          equaled, and their influence is a mighty factor in Hindu thought
          of the present day. Salvation is no longer to be attained by
          works, but by knowledge, and the entire teaching of the
          Upanishads may be comprised in the one famous phrase found in
          the Chandogya Upanishad: Tat tvam asi, "That art thou," or, in
          other words, "Thou art the Infinite." Though the summum bonum of
          the Upanishads is this saving knowledge and the reunion with the
          All-Soul which it brings, such a consummation is not requisite
          for all, since there are many who do not desire it, and for them
          minor blessings are reserved in a future life. The existence of
          the gods is not denied, though they be but phases of the
          All-Soul, nor is the advantage of sacrifice denied, for such
          offerings are still imperative. Herein lies, perhaps, the secret
          of the origin of the Upanishads.

          The concluding portion of each Brahmana is an Aranyaka, or
          "forest-book," designed for the use of those forest hermits who
          had passed beyond the need of sacrifice, and in each Aranyaka is
          an Upanishad. Primarily, therefore, the Upanishads represented
          the text-books of those who had passed through the sacrificial
          stage of their religious life and were henceforth free to
          meditate on sacred things as seemed best in their own eyes.
          Later, however, the Upanishads became a special form of the
          sacred writings of the Hindus; and served as the basis of the
          most lofty of all their six orthodox systems of philosophy. To
          see in them a religious revolt of the second, or warrior, caste
          against Brahman control, as certain scholars have sought to do,
          seems, on the whole, scarcely warranted.

    2. The Six Orthodox Systems of Philosophy.

          Somewhat subsequent to the Upanishads were developed the six
          orthodox systems of Indian philosophy, the Samkhya and Yoga, the
          Vaiseshika and Nyaya, and the Purvamimamsa and Vedanta. Of these
          the Vaiseshika and Nyaya are systems of logic rather than of
          philosophy; the Samkhya and Yoga, which supplement each other,
          are essentially dualistic; while the Purvamimamsa and Vedanta,
          of which the former is the least important of all the systems,
          represent the spiritual aftermath of the Upanishads, and are,
          accordingly, rigidly pantheistic.

  III. The Age of the Buddhistic and Jainistic Heresies:

          Beneath the excessive ritual of the Brahmanistic period and the
          pantheistic speculations of a chosen few still lay the popular
          faith of the Aryan invaders of India. Meanwhile, however, the
          course of immigration had moved still further to the east and
          become centered about the holy city of Benares. The doctrine of
          the misery of all earthly existence was by this time accepted by
          all, and the teachings of metempsychosis were fully established.
          The worship of Siva, originally a local godling of some
          aboriginal western tribe, was attaining such popularity that he
          was opposed as the Destroyer to the Vedic sun-god Vishnu, who
          was worshiped as the Preserver (of the universe). For the sake
          of symmetry, Brahma, denoting in the Rig-Veda "prayer," was
          developed by the priestly theologians into Brahma, the Creator,
          who, though on the whole a pale abstract deity, respected rather
          than worshiped, formed the third member of the trimurti, or
          triad.

          The religious texts of this period are comparatively few, though
          from them may be gleaned data of the greatest importance for a
          knowledge of India's faith. The principal sources are the law
          books, especially the famous code of Manu, and the Mahabharata,
          the great epic of India and the longest poem of all literature.
          From the point of view of orthodox Hinduism, however, the epoch,
          possibly because of the comparative scantiness of material,
          presents less of interest than any of the others. It was, on the
          other hand, essentially the age of heresy, this term denoting in
          India simply a formal denial of the divine authority of the
          three canonical Vedas. There had, of course, been heretics and
          infidels long before this period; traces of them occur as early
          as the tenth book of the Rig-Veda, but it was not until the
          period under consideration that heresies of lasting importance
          were able to develop. In the sixth century B.C. arose two
          independent teachers, both from the Kshatriya, or warrior, class
          and both accordingly more or less antagonistic to the Brahmans.
          Forebodings of such a struggle between the two upper castes are
          not lacking in the Upanishads, where, in more than one instance,
          a warrior rose superior to a Brahman in theological learning.

          Rebelling against Brahman supremacy, ignoring salvation by
          sacrifice, rejecting the authority of the Vedas, teaching
          emancipation from the pain of life and the misery of rebirth by
          personal service to all living creatures however lowly, and
          choosing, moreover, with pointed significance, as their
          linguistic medium the despised popular dialects instead of the
          hallowed Sanskrit of the Brahmans, Sakya Muni (Buddha) and
          Mahavira founded the religions which still exist as
          [494]Buddhism and [495]Jainism. When, after the lapse of nearly
          a millennium, those two religions lost their hold upon India, a
          new form of Brahmanism arose in what is known as [496]Hinduism,
          the basis of which was a compromise between the orthodox and
          philosophical Brahmanism of pre-Buddhistic times and the
          religions of the Dravidian and other non-Aryan peoples of
          southern India. See [497]India.

          Bibliography: The literature of India itself is enormous, and
          that upon it is almost as great. A bibliography of India is much
          needed. The most accessible and convenient body of sources for
          the English reader is the SBE, more than half of which is
          devoted to translations from the various departments of Indian
          literature. Outside of this collection, the following texts and

   Brahmo Somaj
          BRAHMO SOMAJ: A Hindu theistic society. Its aim is the
          monotheistic reform of the Hindu polytheistic religion. The
          founder, Rammohan Roy (b. 1774), of Brahman descent, through the
          study of the Koran and the Bible became estranged from his
          ancestral belief, and was attracted by Christianity, without,
          however, getting beyond a rationalistic pantheism. He endeavored
          to formulate a universal monotheism based upon various ancient
          scriptures. He denounced ethnic impurities, but maintained the
          institution of caste. In 1816 he gathered a small community at
          Calcutta, the Atmiya Sabha, of which he was the leader till his
          death, Sept. 28, 1833, at Bristol, England, where he acted as
          political agent.

          The weakened reform party was strengthened in 1839 by the
          founding of the Tatwabodhini Sabha, whose leader was Babu
          Devendranath Tagore. He held aloof from Christian influences in
          the patriotic effort to restore (what he regarded as) the pure
          religion of the Vedas, but finally conceived a deistic system on
          the basis of reason, rejecting all scriptures. In 1862 the
          religious community was reorganized as the Adi Somaj. Meanwhile
          a follower named Dayanand Saraswati had turned again to the
          Vedas, which he regarded as teaching a purely theistic religion,
          and as anticipating also the results of modern culture. He
          founded the Arya Somaj, the adherents of which came afterward
          under spiritualistic influences. The two societies last named
          found a competitor in the adherents of Babu Keshav Chandra Sen
          (b. Nov. 19, 1838, at Calcutta), who, through European culture
          had become dissatisfied with the religion of his ancestors, and
          attempted to find rest in philosophy. But this brought no
          satisfaction to his religiously disposed mind. After much study
          of the Bible he came to a decision, and in 1858 joined the Adi
          Somaj. For a time he cooperated with Devendranath Tagore, but
          finally found himself at variance with this conservatively
          disposed leader, who did not approve his bold denunciation of
          the shameful practises of heathenism, and even of caste. After
          the rupture which naturally resulted, in 1863 he founded the
          Brahmo Somaj of India, which soon developed an activity that
          almost rivaled the Christian propaganda. He went to England in
          1870, where he was much honored. Many Christian ideas tending to
          promote his cause were brought back by him to India, and the
          Brahmo Somaj found many adherents. But he grew more conservative
          and gradually drew away from Occidental influences. The
          representatives of progress separated and founded the Sadharan
          Brahmo Somaj. Only the less important members of the former
          community adhered to Chandra Sen, who lost himself more and more
          in a dark mysticism. Finally he appeared as the founder of a
          world-religion ("The New Dispensation"), as he claimed by divine
          command. For the new Church he prepared a ritual and teaching.
          Nevertheless, his success was not striking, though by his small
          circle of adherents he was almost worshiped. He died January 8,
          1884. His successor, Babu Protap Chandra Mozumdar, had great
          difficulty in preventing the further disruption of the
          community, and little progress was made. In 1891 it numbered
          3,051 members, mostly in Bengal.

          The Arya Somaj had a larger success, developing especially in
          the United Provinces and the Punjab, numbering some 40,000
          members. But few of the Brahmo Somaj have accepted Christianity.

   Brainerd, David
          BRAINERD, DAVID: Missionary to the American Indians; b. at
          Haddam, Conn., Apr. 20, 1718; d. at the home of Jonathan Edwards
          (to whose daughter Jemima he was engaged), Northampton, Mass.,
          Oct. 9, 1747. He entered Yale College in 1739 and was expelled
          in his junior year; it was the time of the Great Awakening and
          Brainerd, who was "sober and inclined to melancholy" from
          childhood, sympathized with the "New Lights" (Whitefield,
          Tennent, and their followers); he attended their meetings when
          forbidden to do so, and criticized one of the tutors as having
          "no more grace than a chair"; as a consequence he was expelled.
          He was licensed at Danbury, Conn., July 29, 1742; was approved
          as a missionary by the New York correspondents of the Society in
          Scotland for Propagating Christian Knowledge, Nov. 25, 1742, and
          labored among the Indians at Kaunaumeek (Brainerd, Rensselaer
          County, N. Y., 18 m. s.e. of Albany) Apr., 1743-Mar., 1744; was
          ordained as a missionary at Newark, N. J., June 12, 1744; ten
          days later began work at what was intended to be his permanent
          station, at the forks of the Delaware, near Easton, Penn.; in
          October he visited the Indians on the Susquehanna, and June 19,
          1745, began to preach at Crossweeksung (Crosswick, 9 m. s.e. of
          Trenton), the scene of his greatest success. His life among the
          Indians was one of hardship and suffering borne with heroic
          fortitude and self-devotion; his health gave way under the
          strain and he relinquished the work, Mar. 20, 1747, dying from
          consumption. The portions of his diary dealing with his work at
          Crossweeksung (June 19-Nov. 4, 1745, and Nov. 24, 1745-June 19,
          1746) were published before his death, by the commissioners of
          the Society (Mirabilia dei inter Indicos: or the rise and
          progress of a remarkable work of grace among a number of the
          Indians in the provinces of New Jersey and Pennsylvania; and
          Divine Grace Displayed: or the continuance and progress of a
          remarkable work of grace, etc., both published at Philadelphia,
          1746, and commonly known as "Brainerd's Journal"). All of his
          papers, including an account of his early life and the original
          copy of his diary, were left with Jonathan Edwards, who prepared
          An Account of the Life of the Late Rev. David Brainerd (Boston,
          1749), omitting the parts of the diary already published. The
          life and diary entire, with his letters and other writings, were
          edited by S. E. Dwight (New Haven, 1822) and by J. M. Sherwood
          (New York, 1884). His place as missionary was taken, at his
          request, by his brother John (b. at Haddam, Conn., Feb. 28,
          1720; d. at Deerfield, N. J., Mar. 18, 1781). He was graduated
          at Yale, 1746. His work was hindered by disputes about title to
          Indian lands, war, and opposition from the Quakers; he was
          dismissed by the Society in Scotland in 1755, reengaged in 1756,
          again dismissed in 1757, and again asked to return in 1759; the
          funds provided by the Society and by the Synod of New York and
          New Jersey were insufficient, and he gave freely from his own
          scanty means; he served the whites no less faithfully than the
          Indians and was at the same time both foreign and home
          missionary; after 1777 he had charge of a church at Deerfield.

          County, N. Y., June 17, 1804; d. at Scranton, Penn., Aug. 22,
          1866. He gave up the study of law for theology, and was
          graduated at Andover in 1831; was pastor of the Fourth
          Presbyterian Church, Cincinnati, 1831-33; of the Pine Street
          (Third) Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, 1837 till his death.
          He was a leader of the New School branch of the Presbyterian
          Church, a personal friend of Lyman Beecher and Albert Barnes;
          was distinguished for patriotic ardor and services during the
          Civil War. Ha wrote much for religious periodicals, edited the
          Cincinnati Journal, a Presbyterian religious paper (1833-36),
          and a young people's paper, and wrote the Life of John Brainerd
          (Philadelphia, 1865). His great-great-grandfather was an uncle
          of David and John Brainerd, the missionaries.

          BRAMHALL, JOHN: Protestant archbishop of Armagh; b. at or near
          Pontefract (22 m. s.s.w. of York), Yorkshire, 1594; d. at Omagh
          (30 m. s. of Londonderry), County Tyrone, Ireland, June 25,
          1663. He studied at Sidney Sussex College, Cambridge (B.A.,
          1612; M.A., 1616; B.D., 1623; D.D., 1630); took orders about
          1616 and distinguished himself in Yorkshire, where he received
          several appointments. In 1633 he went to Ireland as chaplain to
          Wentworth (afterward Earl of Strafford); became archdeacon of
          Meath, and, in 1634, bishop of Derry. He did much to increase
          the revenues of the Irish Church, and tried to establish
          episcopacy more firmly. Most of the time from the Irish
          insurrection of 1641 till the Restoration he spent on the
          Continent, was made archbishop of Armagh in 1661, and as such
          displayed a commendable moderation in striving to secure
          conformity. His works were collected by John Vesey, archbishop
          of Tuam, and published at Dublin in 1677; they include five
          treatises against Romanists, three against sectaries, three
          against Hobbes, and seven miscellaneous, in defense of royalist
          and Anglican views. The works are reprinted in the Library of
          Anglo-Catholic Theology (5 vols., Oxford, 1842-45) with life.

   Brandenburg, Bishopric of
          BRANDENBURG, BISHOPRIC OF: A diocese established by Otto the
          Great in 948, including the territory between the Elbe on the
          west, the Oder on the east, and the Black Elster on the south,
          and taking in the Uckermark to the north. It was originally
          under the archiepiscopal jurisdiction of Mainz, but in 968 was
          transferred to that of Magdeburg. The disturbances of 983
          practically annihilated it; bishops continued to be named, but
          they were merely titular, until the downfall of the Wends in the
          twelfth century and the German settlement of that region revived
          the bishopric. Bishop Wigers (1138-60) was the first of a series
          of bishops of the Premonstratensian order; which chose the
          occupants of the see until 1447; in that year a bull of Nicholas
          V gave the right of nomination to the elector of Brandenburg,
          with whom the bishops stood in a close feudal relation. The last
          actual bishop was Matthias von Jagow (d. 1544), who took the
          side of the Reformation, married, and in every way furthered the
          undertakings of [499]Elector Joachim II. There were two more
          nominal bishops, but on the petition of the latter of these, the
          electoral prince John George, the secularization of the
          bishopric was undertaken and finally accomplished, in spite of
          legal proceedings to have the bishopric declared immediately
          dependent on the empire and so to preserve it, which dragged on
          into the seventeenth century.

   Brandenburg, Confessions
          BRANDENBURG, CONFESSIONS or CONFESSIONS OF THE MARK
          (Confessiones marchicæ, i.e., Brennoburgenses): The confessions
          of the mark Brandenburg during the Reformation. They are three
          in number: (1) the Confession prepared by order of Johann
          Sigismund, elector of Brandenburg, 1614, which was intended to
          reconcile the views of Luther with those of Calvin (see
          [500]Sigismund, Johann); (2) the Leipsic Colloquy, 1631, i.e.,
          the declarations of the theologians who took part in the
          [501]Colloquy of Leipsic, 1631; (3) the Declaration of Thorn,
          1645 (see [502]Thorn, Conference of).

   Brann, Henry Athanasius
          BRANN, HENRY ATHANASIUS: Roman Catholic; b. at Parkstown (27 m.
          s.w. of Drogheda), County Meath, Ireland, Aug. 15, 1837. He came
          to the United States at the age of ten, and was educated at St.

          theology. Four years later he became director of an
          ecclesiastical seminary at Wheeling, W. Va., where he remained
          until 1870, when he was appointed rector of St. Elizabeth's
          Church, Fort Washington, N. Y. Twenty years later he became
          rector of St. Agness Church, New York City, where he still
          remains. He is archdiocesan censor of books and has written

   Brann, Marcus
          BRANN, MARCUS: German Jewish historian; b. at Rawitsch (64 m. s.
          of Posen) July 9, 1849. He was educated at the University of
          Breslau (Ph.D., 1873) and the rabbinical seminary in the same
          city, from which he was graduated in 1875. He was then a rabbi
          in various cities of Germany until 1891, when he was appointed
          to succeed H. Graetz as professor of history and Biblical
          exegesis in the Jewish theological seminary at Breslau, where he
          still remains. He has written: De Herodis Magni filiis patrem in

          He likewise collaborated with F. Rosenthal in editing the
          Gedenkbuch zur Erinnerung an David Kaufmann (Breslau, 1900).

   Brant, Sebastian
          BRANT, br??nt, SEBASTIAN: German satirist; b. at Strasburg 1457;
          d. there May 10,1521. He was but ten years old when his father
          died, and, after being educated privately, entered the
          University of Basel in 1475, where the strife between realism
          and nominalism had been revived as a struggle between humanism
          and scholasticism. There Brant devoted himself half-heartedly to
          the study of law, but his preference for philosophy and poetry
          proved too unremunerative to yield him a livelihood, so he was
          obliged to take up the study of jurisprudence in earnest, and
          finally received the degree of doctor of civil and canon law in
          1489. Meanwhile he had developed a literary activity which led
          him, in addition to the lectures which he delivered after 1484,
          to write book upon book, partly on jurisprudence, both in Latin
          and the vernacular, and partly in verse, chiefly in German.
          Filled with longing for his native city, he applied for the
          vacant position of syndic, and secured it in the early part of
          1501, both through his own reputation and through the
          recommendation of Johann Geiler. Two years afterward he was
          appointed secretary of the municipality, and later was made
          imperial councilor to the emperor Maximilian.

    His "Ship of Fools."

          Though Brant was either the author or the editor of a long
          series of books, there is but one which has preserved his fame
          to the present day, the Narrenschiff (Basel, 1494). The end of
          the Middle Ages, which marked the wreck and ruin of all the
          ancient conditions in Church and State, as well as in moral and
          social life, was felt most keenly in Germany, where it evoked a
          spirit of satire which spared neither life nor death. The most
          striking representative of this tendency, next to the Dance of
          Death, is the Narrenschiff of Brant. Wherever the poet looked,
          he saw only folly, regardless of sex, age, or estate, and as at
          carnival the mummers ran through the streets in the guise of
          fools, often with ships on wheels, he regarded life as a great
          carnival, where fool on fool took his seat in the ship of fools
          to voyage to Narragonia, the land of fools. Brant was,
          therefore, in this sense the spokesman of his time, and his work
          has become immortal in that it is a mirror of the period. He
          remained true, moreover, to the genius of the German people,
          despite his attraction toward humanism and his numerous
          sentiments and parallels drawn from the classics. His views and
          his habits of thought were taken from the life around him, and
          his German, though evidently based on his Latinity, is neither
          as awkward nor as unintelligible as that of Niclas of Wyle
          immediately preceding him or that of his successor Hutten. He
          was so far from intending to restrict his work to the learned
          that he even considered those who did not know how to read, and
          accordingly adorned his book with pictures as a substitute for
          the letters. The Narrenschiff, therefore, alternates between
          picture and text, thus giving a double representation of folly,
          an arrangement which divides the poem into disjointed fragments
          succeeding each other by chance rather than by design, although
          the diversity of the material would scarcely have permitted the
          author to mold it into a homogeneous whole. Yet Brant was swayed
          by two opposing tendencies, and while, on the one hand, he did
          not hesitate to expose the faults in the external life of the
          Church with its lack of faith, and its lack of morality, he
          feared to touch its inner and higher teachings, and lamented the
          wavering bark of St. Peter, upbraiding the heretics and
          regarding the printer as an unmixed evil.

          Bibliography: The Narrenschiff was reprinted many times and was
          as frequently revamped, especially in the Latin translation of
          Jakob Locher Philomusus (1497). In 1497 it was translated into
          French, four years later into Latin verse by Jodocus Badius
          Ascensius, in 1519 into Low German, and in 1635 into Dutch,
          while in 1509 it was rendered into English by [503]Alexander
          Barclay under the title of the Ship o/ Fools. The best German
          edition is by F. Zarncke, Leipsic, 1854, next to it is that by
          K. Goedeke, ib. 1872. In 1498 a series of sermons was based upon
          the Narrenschiff by Geiler of Kaisersberg, and it was repeatedly
          imitated, as in the Von S. Ursulen-Schifflein, by the
          Brotherhood of St. Ursula (Strasburg, 1497), and by Brant's
          compatriot, Thomas Murner, in his Narrenbeschwörung (1512).

          BRATTON, THEODORE DU BOSE: Protestant Episcopal bishop of
          Mississippi; b. at Winnsboro, S. C., Nov. 11, 1862. He studied
          at the University of the South, Sewanee, Tenn., but withdrew in
          1882, a few months before graduation, because of trouble with
          his eyes. He was at once appointed proctor of the university,
          and in 1883 became a teacher in the preparatory school attached
          to the same institution. He pursued theological studies in St.
          Luke's Theological Hall, the seminary of the University, and was
          graduated in 1887. He was ordered deacon in the same year and
          was priested in 1888, after having been a missionary in his
          native State in the interval. He was then rector of the Church
          of the Advent, Spartanburg, S. C., 1888-99, also being professor
          of history in Converse College, Spartanburg, 1890-99, after
          which he was rector of St. Mary's School for Girls at Raleigh,

          BRAY, THOMAS: Church of England; b. at Merton, near Cherbury (17
          m. s.w. of Shrewsbury), Shropshire, 1656; d. in London Feb. 15,
          1730. He studied at Oxford (B.A., All Souls, 1678; M.A., Hart
          Hall, 1693; B.D. and D.D., Magdalen, 1696), took orders about
          1678, and soon won friends and advancement by his "exemplary
          behaviour and distinguished diligence." In 1690 he became rector
          of Sheldon, Warwickshire. In 1696 Bishop Compton of London
          appointed him commissary for Maryland. He was unable to sail for
          the colony until Dec., 1699, landed in Mar., 1700, but after a
          residence of less than six months returned to England, finding
          he could better promote the interests of the province there.
          From 1706 he was rector of St. Botolph Without, Aldgate, London.

    Bray's Varied and Effective Activity.

          Bray's life furnishes a striking example of what can be
          accomplished by energy, good judgment, and disinterested
          benevolence. As soon as he was appointed commissary for Maryland
          he took up the work, and, while detained in England, tried to
          find there suitable men to send out as missionaries and formed a
          plan to provide them with books. He did not limit his good
          services to Maryland, and his plan grew into a scheme for a
          "Protestant congregation pro propaganda fide by charter from the
          king." When this failed in spite of persistent endeavor, he
          organized a voluntary society to provide libraries at home and
          abroad and to support schools and missions for the colonies and
          the heathen. The first meeting was held Mar. 8, 1699, and this
          was the beginning of the [506]Society for the Promotion of
          Christian Knowledge. In June,1701, he divided its work and
          procured a royal charter for a second society--the [507]Society
          for the Propagation of the Gospel in Foreign Parts. From his
          appointment as commissary till he was able to sail he bore his
          own expenses and he paid the costs of his voyage. By his return
          he forfeited his salary, which was available only when he was in
          Maryland. A present of £400 he devoted to public use. He
          collected and managed a fund for the instruction of the negroes
          in the provinces, and, at the age of seventy-one, became
          interested in the prisoners in the London jails and undertook to
          ameliorate their condition. It is believed that he influenced
          General Oglethorpe to found the colony of Georgia. His
          benefactions were continued by numerous bequests in his will.

    Libraries in America.

          Bray's exertions resulted in the foundation of nearly forty
          libraries in America. In 1699, just before he sailed for
          Maryland, he wrote that he had sent books to the value of £2,400
          into the plantations, "whereby thirty libraries have been
          already advanced, and a foundation is laid of seventy libraries
          more." The greater number were in Maryland, but there were
          several in Virginia, two in North Carolina, and one each in
          Boston, Rhode Island, New York City, Albany, New Jersey,
          Philadelphia, and Charleston. That at Annapolis, Md., was the
          largest collection of books at the time in the plantations and
          was the first lending library in the British colonies. Its
          remains are now in the possession of St. John's College,
          Annapolis. The remnant of the Boston library is in the Boston
          Athenæum.

    The Bray Associates.

          After a severe illness in 1723 Bray chose four friends to assist
          in the management of the negro schools and continue his work
          after his death. Thus originated "Dr. Bray's Associates for
          Founding Clerical Libraries and Supporting Negro Schools," an
          association which has continued to exist and in 1906 reported
          130 libraries maintained in England and Wales and 153 in
          sixty-seven colonial and missionary dioceses; during the year
          two new libraries were founded and negro schools were maintained
          in Nova Scotia and the Bahama Islands. The total number of
          libraries founded in Great Britain and the colonies is over 500.
          About eighty of the total number were founded by Dr. Bray,
          exclusive of those established in America. A reorganization of
          the "Associates" was effected in 1905, and a division of the
          funds was made whereby the income of an endowment amounting to
          about £7,000 will be applied to the support of the schools; the
          remainder of the funds, amounting to about £4,500, will be used
          to establish, maintain, or augment theological libraries in
          Great Britain or elsewhere for the use of clergymen of the
          Church of England and students who are candidates for holy
          orders.

    Writings.

          While at Sheldon, Bray planned A Course of Lectures upon the
          Church Catechism, in 4 volumes, and completed vol. i, twenty-six
          lectures, On the Preliminary Questions and Answers (Oxford,
          1696); the book proved popular, brought him upward of £700,
          extended his reputation to London, and helped to secure his
          appointment as commissary; vols. ii-iv were not completed. In
          connection with his library plans he published: Bibliotheca
          parochialis, or a scheme of such theological heads as are
          requisite to be studied by every pastor of a parish, with a
          catalogue of books (London, 1697; 2d ed., much changed, 1707);
          An Essay towards Promoting All Necessary and Useful Knowledge
          (1697), closing with a catalogue of sixty-three books "designed
          to lay the foundation of lending-libraries to be fixed in all
          the market-towns in England "; Bibliotheca catechetica, or the
          country curate's library (1702); and Primordia bibliothecaria
          (1726), in which he gives "several schemes of parochial
          libraries" and outlines a method "to proceed by a gradual
          progression from strength to strength, from a collection not
          much exceeding in value £1 to £100." Several Circular Letters to
          the Clergy of Maryland (1701) treats of the "work of
          catechising" and the "duty of preaching," with many practical
          directions for the use of books; a list for a "layman's library"
          is appended. Of interest as Americana are: a sermon on Apostolic
          Charity, preceded by A General View of the English Colonies in
          America with Respect to Religion (London, 1698); a sermon on The
          Necessity of an Early Religion, preached before the Assembly of
          Maryland (Annapolis, 1700; the earliest extant work printed in
          Maryland); The Acts of Dr. Bray's Visitation at Annapolis, May
          23-25, 1700 (London, 1700; reprinted in F. L. Hawks's
          Contributions to the Ecclesiastical History of the United
          States, vol. ii, New York, 1839, pp. 497-523); A Memorial
          Representing the Present State of Religion on the Continent of
          North America (1700). He was a strong Anti-Romanist, and another
          noteworthy publication was Papal Usurpation and Persecution
          (1712), intended as a supplement to Fox's Book of Martyrs. The
          materials gathered for this volume and a continuation of it,
          which he did not complete, he left to Sion College, London.

          Bibliography: Bray's Life and Designs, written probably, by
          Richard Rawlinson (d. 1755) and preserved in manuscript in the
          Bodleian Library, has been made the basis of all subsequent
          accounts (such as Public Spirit Illustrated in the Life and
          Designs of the Rev. Thomas Bray, London, 1746, 2d ed., with
          notes and the report of the "Associates" for 1807, by Henry J.
          Todd, 1808), and has been printed in full, with valuable notes

          Review, ii (1897), 59-75, gives an account of Bray's American
          libraries. Some information concerning the fate of those in
          England may be found in the Transactions and Proceedings of the
          First Annual Meeting of the Library Association of the United
          Kingdom, pp. 51-53, 145-150, London, 1879. A paper by J. F.

          of the American Society of Church History, vol. ii, part 1, New
          York, 1890, deals with the Bray libraries. The "Associates"
          (address, 19 Delahay St., London, S. W.) publish an annual
          report which contains a brief Memoir of Dr. Bray.

   Brazil
          BRAZIL: A republic of eastern South America; area, 3,218,100
          square miles; population, 15,000,000. Brazil became independent
          of Portugal by the creation of the Empire of Brazil in 1822,
          which was superseded without war in 1889 by the United States of
          Brazil, forming a republic with a new constitution framed in
          1891. Each of twenty states sends representatives to the senate
          and house of deputies, but retains a large measure of
          self-government. It is expressly forbidden to "create, support,
          or prevent religious denominations," the basal principle being
          the free exercise of all religions, so far as they are not
          prejudicial to the public welfare. No religion, therefore,
          receives aid from the State, and civil marriage before a
          magistrate is legal, while instruction in the schools is
          required to be secular, the religious orders being suppressed.
          Simultaneously with the promulgation of this constitution, and
          partly in consequence of it, there was a rapid increase in
          immigration from Europe to Brazil, although for many years
          previously a considerable number of Italians had been coming to
          the country. This, however, made little change in religious
          conditions, although in more recent times the German immigration
          has somewhat increased, and a small number of North Americans
          has been added to the Italians, particularly in the cities; this
          increase, predominantly Protestant, is almost negligible in
          comparison with the numbers of Italians, Portuguese, and
          Spaniards. Non-German Protestant denominations are also
          represented, especially in the maritime towns, where there are
          English churches, which, however, do not always have permanent
          rectors. The Presbyterians, particularly from North America,
          have settled in considerable numbers in São Paulo, where they
          have established a college, and the American Seaman's Friend
          Society has an agent in the capital, Rio de Janeiro. In 1899 the
          Protestant Episcopal Church made the [508]Rev. Lucien Lee
          Kinsolving bishop of southern Brazil, with residence at Rio
          Grande do Sul (São Pedro). In 1907 his diocese was made an
          integral part of the American Episcopal Church.

          German Protestantism is represented over an extensive territory
          and has numerous centers, as is shown by the existence of two
          great ecclesiastical bodies, the "Evangelical German Synod,"
          subject to the jurisdiction of the higher church council of
          Berlin since 1869, and the "Evangelical Synodical Union" of
          1884. The latter receives its clergy not only from Berlin, but
          also through the missionary societies of Barmen and Basel,
          especially in view of the number of Swiss immigrants to Brazil.
          Many German evangelical communities, as well as scattered
          members of the Evangelical Church are found both in Rio de
          Janeiro itself and the state of the same name (including
          Petropolis) and the state of Espirito Santo (including
          Leopoldina), and especially in the four southern states of São
          Paulo, Paraná, Santa Catharina, and Rio Grande do Sul. In the
          latter state there are forty congregations, while in Santa
          Catharina 7,500 Protestants live in the German city of Blumenau
          alone, and of the 100,000 Germans in the state about two-thirds
          are evangelical. All the districts with a German population are
          richly provided with schools, even though all branches of
          instruction are not as thorough as might be desired. Evangelical
          schools, however, are not infrequently replaced by
          interdenominational religious schools. In the Roman Catholic
          German communities careful provision is made for schools, and in
          a number of colonies the educational activity of the clergy is
          such that they receive salaries from the State.

          The Roman Catholic Church has two archdioceses in Brazil: (1)
          Bahia or São Salvador (founded as a bishopric in 1555, made an
          archbishopric in 1676), with the suffragan bishoprics of Alagoas
          (founded 1900; residence at Maceió), Amazon (1893; residence
          Manáos), Belem or Pará (1719), Fortaleza or Ceará (1854), Goyaz
          (1826; residence Uberava), São Luiz (1677; residence Maranhão)
          Olinda (1676), Parahyba (1893), and Piauhy (1902; residence
          Therezina); and (2) São Sebastião or Rio de Janeiro (1676; made
          an archbishopric 1893), with the suffragan bishoprics of
          Curitiba (1893), Cuyabá (1745), Diamantina (1854), Marianna
          (1745), São Paulo (1745), Petropolis (1893), São Pedro (1848;
          residence Porto Alegre), Pouso Alegre (1900), and Espirito Santo
          (1896; residence Vitoria). There is also the exempt prelature of
          Santarem (1903).

          While secular priests are chiefly employed in the service of the
          Church, they are lacking in many districts and their training is
          defective. Despite the suppression of the orders, therefore,
          many of the larger ones have numerous representatives. Although
          they have few stations, they are actively engaged in the
          conversion of the Indians, among whom the Jesuits worked with
          great success in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries in the
          ranges of the Cordilleras and along the Upper Amazon. In 1767
          the Portuguese expelled the Jesuits from Brazil. The aborigines
          in the interior of Brazil still remain uninfluenced by any
          missionary activity.

   Bread and Baking
          BREAD AND BAKING: Bread was for the Hebrews the chief article of
          diet, as it is for modern Palestinian peasants. In early times
          it was made from barley, which was later displaced by wheat,
          except as it remained the staple for the poorer classes, though
          now it is not regarded as altogether wholesome. Primitive usage
          was to roast the ears of grain, which were so eaten especially
          at harvest time (Ruth ii, 14), and, thus prepared, still form a
          convenient food for travelers. In primitive preparation of grain
          for food, a sort of mortar was used to crush it into the coarser
          meal, a handmill for the flour. The latter, of primitive form,
          is still used in the East and consists of two stones, the lower
          one the harder, the middle surfaces not flat, but respectively
          concave and convex, the upper with a hole in the center in which
          the post of the lower is set and into which the grain is poured
          for grinding. The work of grinding fell to the women or to
          slaves, though the later and larger mills were turned by beasts.
          The preparation of meal or flour was a daily task, done as there
          was need for the product. The dough was mixed in a wooden
          kneading-trough, and in early times was unleavened, as is the
          case generally with the modern Bedouin. The dough was made up
          round, flat or disk-shaped, and baked on a layer of heated
          stones from which the coals were removed when the dough was
          placed upon the stones to bake and then replaced. Mention is
          made (Lev. ii, 5) of an iron plate or pan for baking. There came
          to be finally two forms of oven, both in common use among the
          modern peasantry, one of which is heated from the outside, the
          other from the inside. The art of baking was developed with the
          other arts till it became a handicraft or trade, and gave its
          name to a street in Jerusalem (Jer. xxxvii, 21; cf. Hos. vii,
          4). Bread was used in sacred offerings at first either leavened
          or unleavened; later the former was excluded (Ex. xxiii, 18;
          Lev. ii, 11).

          the Presbyterian Board of Foreign Missions 1838-40. He was
          president of the American Colonization Society, and at the time
          of his death was president-elect of Oglethorp University,
          Georgia. He was a leader of the Old School party and an ardent
          controversialist. He published a discussion with Archbishop
          Hughes of New York under the title Roman Catholic Controversy
          (Philadelphia, 1836) and some minor controversial essays.

          Ky., Mar. 8, 1800; d. at Danville, Ky., Dec. 27, 1871. He was
          graduated at Union College, 1819; practised law in Kentucky,
          1823-31, and was a member of the State legislature, 1825-29;
          studied theology at Princeton, 1831-32, was ordained Nov. 26,
          1832, and was pastor of the Second Presbyterian Church,
          Baltimore, 1832-45; president of Jefferson College,
          Pennsylvania, 1845-47; pastor of the First Presbyterian Church,
          Lexington, Ky., and at the same time State superintendent of
          public instruction, 1847-53; professor of theology at Danville
          Seminary, 1853-89. He was a stanch Old School Presbyterian and
          the author of the "Act and Testimony" (1834), complaining of the
          prevalence of doctrinal errors, the relaxation of discipline,
          and the violation of church order, which played an important
          part in the disruption of the Presbyterian Church; he opposed
          the reunion in 1869. He was a bitter opponent of the Roman
          Catholic Church. During the Civil War he defended the Union
          cause and was president of the national Republican convention at
          Baltimore in 1864 which renominated Abraham Lincoln for the
          Presidency. During his residence in Baltimore he edited The
          Literary and Religions Magazine (1835-43), and The Danville
          Review at Danville (1861-65); his principal literary work is two
          volumes, The Knowledge of God, objectively and subjectively
          considered (New York, 1857-59).

   Breckling, Friedrich
          BRECKLING, FRIEDRICH: A forerunner of the Pietistic school; b.
          at Hanved near Flensburg, Sleswick, 1629; died at The Hague Mar.
          16, 1711. He studied at Rostock, where he imbibed the theology
          of Arndt; then at Königsberg, where syncretism was dominant, at
          Helmstädt, where his relation Calixtus then was, at Wittenberg,
          Leipsic, Jena, and Giessen. Here his thesis for the master's
          degree (1653) was criticized as savoring of Weigelianism, but he
          refused to alter it, and published it at Amsterdam under the
          title Mysterium magnum, Christus in nobis (1662). He became
          closely allied with Tackius, and went deeper into theosophy by
          the aid of Hermes Trismegistus, Paracelsus, and Böhme. Going to
          Hamburg, he read Betke's Antichristentum, and was much
          influenced by its conception of priestless Christianity. After
          some years of wandering in search of knowledge, he was ordained
          to be his father's assistant and ultimate successor; but violent
          attacks on the local clergy caused his deposition and
          imprisonment in 1660. Escaping, he went to Amsterdam and got a
          charge at Zwolle, where he spent eight years of comparative
          quiet, but was again deprived of his office, and lived in
          retirement at Zwolle (1668-72), Amsterdam (1672-90), and The
          Hague (1690-1711). He maintained a correspondence with Spener
          and with Gottfried Arnold, whom he helped in his church history,
          and was busily engaged as a writer. In spite of his weaknesses,
          he deserves remembrance as a link in the chain of mystical
          natures who prepared the way for Spener and the Pietistic
          movement.

          at the universities of Erlangen, Bonn, and Göttingen, and was
          pastor at Kuppentin, Mecklenburg, from 1872 to 1878. He then
          resided at Göttingen for a year, and from 1880 to 1883 was

          Hanover, Feb. 1658; d. at the monastery of Berge (Kloster
          Bergen, s. of Magdeburg; the site is now a public park) Mar. 16,
          1732. He studied at Helmstädt, became corector in Wolfenbüttel
          in 1680, and went thence to Kiel, where he continued theological
          studies under [511]Christian Kortholt and became privat-docent.
          Then he lived for some time in Frankfort and came completely
          under Spener's influence. He returned to Kiel as professor of
          homiletics; became court preacher at Meiningen in 1685, went to
          Erfurt in 1687 as preacher at the Dominican Church and became
          professor of theology in the university. His Pietistic
          tendencies aroused much opposition, and in 1691 he removed to
          Halle, where with [512]August Hermann Francke and [513]Paul
          Aston he gave the theological study of the new university its
          peculiar character and direction. In 1705 he added to his other
          duties those of superintendent of the duchy of Magdeburg and in
          1709 was made abbot at the monastery of Berge (then transformed
          into a school). He was a man of much faith, prayerful, and took
          a deep interest in poor students. Besides minor writings, he
          published Institutiones theologicæ (2 vols., Halle, 1694; 2d
          enlarged ed., 1723; vol. iii, Institutiones theologiæ moralis,
          1732); Theses credendorum et agendorum fundamentales (1700). He
          was not without poetic talent and published a collection of
          Poemata miscellanea (Magdeburg, 1720). Some of his hymns are
          still found in the German hymn-books.

   Breitinger, Johann Jakob
          BREITINGER, br?i´tin-ger, JOHANN JAKOB: Swiss theologian; b. at
          Zurich Apr. 19, 1575; d. there Apr. 1, 1645. Not until his
          seventeenth year did his spiritual gifts begin to manifest
          themselves, but from 1593 to 1598 he studied at Reformed
          seminaries in Germany and Holland, and in 1597 became a member
          of the clergy of his native city. His prominence during the
          pestilence of 1611 proved him worthy of the appointment of
          deacon to the church of St. Peter. Two years later he was made
          pastor of the Grossmünster, thus becoming the most important
          clergyman in Zurich, and in 1614 he was appointed school-rector.
          His importance was not due, however, to his religious or
          theological originality, but rather to his political
          intelligence and practical skill in organization and execution,
          combining shrewd circumspection and patience with a versatile
          initiative. His sermons, though not deep, were characterized by
          warmth of feeling, clearness, pithiness, and charm. The most
          important of his works are his synodical addresses, in which he
          sought to exalt the position of the clergy. These sermons,
          delivered at the semiannual sessions of the synod and collected
          by him in the latter years of his life, are models of pastoral
          wisdom, and received practical application in Breitinger's own
          activity. The status of the preachers was revolutionized on the
          basis of two of his speeches before the council in 1628, and he
          secured the general adoption of music in the churches, which
          Zurich had lacked altogether until 1598. He likewise enriched
          the liturgy with sections which are still in use, as with the
          prayer for the dead and the morning prayer after the sermon of
          1638. Breitinger also successfully urged the need of religious
          instruction of the young, as is shown by repeated ordinances of
          1613, 1628, 1637-1638, and 1643. He was, likewise, the ultimate
          author of the custom by which the Swiss Confederations celebrate
          the days of thanksgiving, repentance, and prayer at the same
          time, and it was he who introduced the rule of making a public
          announcement of marriage. In 1634 he introduced into the
          churches of Zurich and eastern Switzerland the use of parochial
          registers, which were to be returned every three years to the
          head of the clergy and thus served as a sort of census-report.
          Four years later he instituted parochial visitations, and
          finally established the ecclesiastical archives of Zurich.

          Breitinger was deeply interested in education, and was also
          active is the establishment of scholarships for poor students.
          He was no less enthusiastic in his patronage of charity, and
          prepared statistics of the poor as early as 1621, while in 1623,
          at the request of the mayor, he published Gutachten der Bettler
          und Armen halber. Three years later, on the basis of further
          studies, Breitinger made noteworthy proposals for houses of
          correction for neglected youth, and was also active in the
          improvement of prisons and hospitals. Ever watchful over the
          morals of the people, he opposed lack of refinement and excess,
          and sought to obviate the evil influences of the war in the
          neighboring kingdom, in addition to restricting lavish
          expenditure in clothing (1616, 1628), and in weddings and
          funerals (1621, 1628, 1640), as well as the drinking of toasts
          (1632), and occasionally even the stage and the cultivation of
          art. A watchful opponent of the hopes and propaganda of
          Catholicism and Anabaptism, he refrained from excessive
          hostility, contenting himself with remaining a constant
          protector of the Reformed. His personal preeminence and his
          interest in his church frequently involved him in political
          problems, and during the Thirty Years' War he was the leader of
          a Swedish party in Zurich. The fortification of the city was
          due, strictly speaking, to him, and had he had his way,
          Switzerland would have been involved in the struggle.

          harbor-cities of Vegesack and Bremerhaven and about ninety-nine
          square miles of contiguous territory. The total population in
          1900 was 224,697, of whom 163,292 belonged to the city of
          Bremen. Ninety-four per cent. are reported as Evangelical
          Protestants, 4.9 per cent. as Roman Catholics; the number of
          Jews is about 1,000. Of the Protestants nearly one-third are
          Reformed. The Protestants have no ecclesiastical organization,
          the government standing at the head of the Church and managing
          its affairs through a commission, which is also the school
          board. The various congregations are independent one of the
          other, but, individually, take a warm interest in missionary and
          benevolent work.

          [514]Willehad on the lower Weser. He was consecrated July 15,
          787, at Worms, on Charlemagne's initiative, his jurisdiction
          being assigned to cover the Saxon territory on both sides of the
          Weser from the mouth of the Aller, northward to the Elbe and
          westward to the Hunte, and the Frisian territory for a certain
          distance from the mouth of the Weser. Willehad fixed his
          headquarters at Bremen, though the formal constitution of the
          bishopric took place only after the subjugation of the Saxons in
          804 or 805, when Willehad's disciple, Willerich, was consecrated
          bishop of Bremen, with the same territory. The diocese was
          probably at that time ecclesiastically subject to Cologne. When,
          after the death of Bishop Leuderich (838-845), it was given to
          Ansgar, it lost its independence (see [515]Ansgar), and from
          that time was permanently united with Hamburg. The new combined
          see was regarded as the headquarters for missionary work in the
          north, and new sees to be erected were to be subject to its
          jurisdiction. Ansgar's successor, Rimbert, the "second apostle
          of the north," was troubled by onslaughts first of the Normans
          and then of the Wends, and by renewed claims on the part of
          Cologne. The see of Bremen attained its greatest prosperity and
          later had its deepest troubles under Adalbert (see [516]Adalbert
          of Hamburg-Bremen). The next two archbishops, Liemar and
          Humbert, were determined opponents of Gregory VII. Under the
          latter the archbishopric of [517]Lund was erected, and Bremen
          had suffragan sees only in name, the Wendish bishoprics having
          been destroyed. Schisms in Church and State marked the next two
          centuries, and in spite of the labors of the [518]Windesheim and
          [519]Bursfelde congregations, the way was prepared for the
          Reformation, which made rapid headway, partly owing to the fact
          that the last Roman Catholic archbishop, Christopher of
          Brunswick, was also bishop of Verden and resided there. By the
          time he died (1558), nothing was left of the old religion
          outside of a few monasteries and the districts served by them.
          The title of archbishop, with the secular jurisdiction, was
          borne for a time by Protestant princes. The Peace of Westphalia
          (1648) secularized it and made it (with Verden) a duchy and an
          appanage of the crown of Sweden. In 1712 it passed into the
          possession of Denmark, and three years later was sold to
          Hanover, to which it was restored in 1813 after the Napoleonic
          disturbances. Its former territory was distributed
          ecclesiastically at this time among the neighboring dioceses of
          Hildesheim, Osnabrück, and Münster, the imperial city of Bremen
          and the surrounding district being administered by the
          vicar-apostolic of the northern missions.

   Brendan, Saint, of Clonfert
          BRENDAN, SAINT, OF CLONFERT (called "the Navigator"); Irish
          saint; b. at Tralee (on Tralee Bay, west coast of Ireland,
          County Kerry) 484; d. at the monastery of his sister, Brigh, at
          Annadown (on the east shore of Lough Corrib, County Galway),
          577. After studying with the most distinguished Irish masters,
          he was ordained presbyter, and then undertook the expedition or
          expeditions which form the basis of "The Navigation of St.
          Brendan," one of the most popular legends of the Middle Ages. In
          552 or 553 (according to others in 556 or 557) he founded the
          monastery of Clonfert (in the barony of Longford, County
          Longford) and ruled it for twenty years, during which time it
          was the most famous school in West Ireland. He is said also to
          have founded a monastery in Brittany. A visit to Columba on
          Hinba Island, near Iona, is recorded, which must have been after
          563, and he is last heard of in 570, when he acted as bard at
          the inauguration of the first Christian king of Cashel.

          According to an Irish life of St. Brendan, when he was ordained
          he pondered on the words in Luke xviii, 29-30, and determined to
          forsake country and brethren and seek a mysterious unknown land
          which he saw in visions. Under angelic guidance he set forth in
          a coracle of wicker work and hides, but after seven years was
          directed to return, as work was waiting for him at home. Some
          years later the impulse to travel again sent him forth, this
          time in a fine ship, fully equipped, and with a crew of sixty.
          "The whole story of the saint's adventures bears neither
          repetition nor criticism: but in the midst of much crude fiction
          we find occasional touches which have evidently, been derived
          from the reports of genuine voyagers. In the course of their
          seven years' adventures they visit the Isle of Sheep, a full
          fair island full of green pasture: another fair island, full of
          flowers, herbs, and trees, where they thank God of his good
          grace: a little island wherein were many vines full of grapes:
          they meet with great tempests, in which they are greatly
          troubled long time and sore forlaboured; at other times calm
          airs and water so clear that they might see all the fishes that
          were about them, whereof they are full sore aghast: again they
          behold an hill all of fire and a foul smoke and stink coming
          from thence: and finally reach an attemperate land, ne too hot
          ne too cold, the fairest country that any man might see, in
          which the trees are charged with ripe fruit and flowers. Here
          they walk forty days, but find no end thereof, and at length
          lade their ships with its fruits and return home" (E. J. Payne,
          History of the New World, i, Oxford, 1892, 106-107). The story
          was known in France, Spain, and Holland in the eleventh century,
          and was very popular with all classes. It exists in translation
          into eight languages. Some of its incidents are derived from
          classical sources; others resemble the Arabian Nights. An
          expedition to the Hebrides and northern islands may have
          furnished the basis of fact.

    1. Early Advocacy of the Reformation.

          Johann Brenz, the German theologian and Swabian Reformer, was
          born at Weil (8 m, s. of Stuttgart) June 24, 1499; d. at
          Stuttgart Sept. 11, 1570. He received his education at
          Heidelberg, where, shortly after becoming magister and regent of
          the Realistenbursa in 1518, he delivered philological and
          philosophical lectures. He also lectured on the Gospel of
          Matthew, only to be prohibited on account of his popularity and
          his novel exegesis, especially as he had already been won over
          to the side of Luther, not only through his ninety-five theses,
          but still more by personal acquaintance with him at the
          disputation at Heidelberg in Apr., 1518. In 1522 Brenz was
          threatened with a trial for heresy, but escaped through a call
          to the pastorate of Hall. In the spring of 1524 he received a
          strong ally in his activity as a Reformer in [520]Johann
          Isenmann, who became pastor of the parish-church at Hall. The
          feast of corpus Christi was the first to be discarded, and in
          1524 the monastery of the Discalced Friars was transformed into
          a school In the Peasants' War, on the other hand, Brenz
          deprecated the abuse of evangelical liberty by the peasants,
          pleading for mercy to the conquered and warning the magistracy
          of their duties. At Christmas the Lord's Supper was administered
          in both kinds, and at Easter of the following year the first
          regulations were framed for the church and the school. Brenz
          himself prepared in 1528 a larger and a smaller catechism for
          the young, both characterized by simplicity, warmth, and a
          childlike spirit.

    2. Activity in behalf of the New Movement.

          He first attained wider recognition, however, when he published
          his Syngramma Suevicum on Oct. 21,1525, attacking OEcolampadius,
          and finding the explanation of the creative power of the word of
          Christ in the theory that the body and blood of Christ are
          actually present in the sacrament. Henceforth Brenz took part in
          all the important conferences on the religious situation. In
          Oct., 1529, he attended the Colloquy of Marburg, and in the
          following year, at the request of the Margrave George of
          Brandenburg, he was present at the diet in Augsburg, where he
          seconded Melanchthon in his efforts to reach an agreement with
          the adherents of the ancient faith, but refused all association
          with the followers of Zwingli. In 1532 he collaborated in the
          church-regulations of Brandenburg and Nuremberg, and furthered
          the Reformation in the margravate of Brandenburg-Ansbach,
          Dinkelsbühl, and Heilbronn, while three years later Duke Ulrich
          of Württemberg called him as an adviser in the framing of
          regulations for the church, visitations, and marriage. In Feb.,
          1537, he was at Schmalkald, and two months later undertook the
          difficult but successful task of the reformation of the
          University of Tübingen. He likewise attended the conference on
          the use of images held at Urach, Sept., 1537, where he urged
          their abolition. Brenz returned to Hall in April of the
          following year, in June, 1540, attended the conference at
          Hagenau, was at Worms in the latter part of the same year, and
          in Jan., 1546, was at Regensburg, where he was obliged to deal
          with Cochlæus, although, as he had foreseen, he was
          unsuccessful. He devoted himself with great zeal to his pastoral
          duties, and side by side with his sermons was evolved a valuable
          series of expositions of Biblical writings.

    3. Opposed by the Emperor.

          After the last remnants of the ancient regulations of the church
          of Hall had been abolished, his new rules appeared in 1543.
          Calls to Leipsic in 1542, to Tübingen in 1543, and to Strasburg
          in 1548 were declined in favor of his position at Hall. Brenz
          had long opposed the adherence of Hall and the margrave to the
          Schmalkald League, since he regarded resistance to the temporal
          authorities as inadmissible. Gradually, however, his views
          changed, through the hostile attitude of the emperor. In 1538
          Hall entered the League, and after its defeat Charles V came to
          the city (Dec. 16, 1546), and obtained possession of papers,
          letters, and sermons of Brenz, who, despite the bitter cold, was
          obliged to flee, although he returned Jan. 4, 1547. The new
          Interim of the emperor (see [521]Interim), which Brenz called
          interitus ("ruin"), recalled him to the scene of action, and he
          earnestly opposed its adoption. The imperial chancellor,
          Granvella, demanded his surrender, and Brenz, warned by a note
          reading: "Flee, Brenz, quickly, more quickly, most quickly!"
          escaped on the evening of his forty-ninth birthday, June 24,
          1548. He hastened to Duke Ulrich, who concealed him in the
          castle of Hohenwittlingen near Urach, where, under the pseudonym
          of Joannes Witlingius, he prepared an exposition of Ps. xciii
          and cxxx. As the emperor was everywhere searching for him,
          Ulrich sent him by way of Strasburg to Basel, where he was
          kindly received and found time to write an exposition of the
          prophecy of Isaiah. Duke Christopher called him to Mömpelgard,
          where, in Jan., 1549, Brenz was notified of the death of his
          wife. The condition of his children induced him to go to Swabia,
          but owing to the pursuit of the emperor, he was often in great
          danger, and the duke sheltered him in the castle of Hornberg
          near Gutach. There he spent eighteen months under the name of
          Huldrich Engster (Encaustius), always active for the welfare of
          the Church, both by his advice to the duke and his theological
          labors. He declined calls to Magdeburg, Königsberg, and England.
          In Aug., 1549, he ventured to go to Urach, where his friend
          Isenmann was now minister, in order to take counsel with the
          duke, his advisers, and [522]Matthæus Alber, regarding the
          restoration of the evangelical divine service. In the autumn of
          1550 he married for his second wife Catherine, the oldest
          daughter of Isenmann.

    4. Activity, 1550-53.

          After Ulrich's death Brenz was asked to prepare the confessio
          Wirtembergica for the Council of Trent, and with three other
          Wittenberg theologians and Johann Marbach of Strasburg, he went
          to Trent, Mar., 1552, to defend his creed (see [523]Beurlin,
          Jakob). Great was the surprise of the fathers of the council,
          but they refused to be instructed by those who were to obey
          them. The Interim was abolished. Brenz who had thus far lived at
          Stuttgart, Tübingen, Ehningen, and Sindelfingen as counselor of
          the duke, was made provost of the Cathedral of Stuttgart, Sept.
          24, 1554, and appointed ducal counselor for life. He was now the
          right hand of the duke in the reorganization of ecclesiastical
          and educational affairs in Württemberg. The great church order
          of 1553-59, containing also the confessio Wirtembergica, in
          spite of its dogmatism, is distinguished by clearness, mildness,
          and consideration. In like manner, his Catechismus pia et utile
          explicatione illustratus (Frankfort, 1551) became a rich source
          of instruction for many generations and countries. The
          proposition made by Kaspar Leyser and Jakob Andreä, in 1554 to
          introduce a form of discipline after a Calvinistic model was
          opposed by Brenz, since he held that the minister should have
          charge of the preaching, the exhortation to repentance, and
          dissuasion from the Lord's Supper, whereas excommunication
          belonged to the whole church. At the instance of the duke, Brenz
          moved in 1553 to Neuburg, to arrange the church affairs of the
          Palatinate.

    5. Controversies.

          The Osiandric controversy about the doctrine of justification,
          in 1551 and the following years, which caused a scandalous
          schism in Prussia, was a cause of much annoyance and defamation
          to Brenz, who saw in this controversy nothing but a war of
          words. In 1554-1555 the question of the Religious Peace of
          Augsburg occupied his mind; in 1556 the conference with Johannes
          a Lasco, in 1557 the Frankenthal conference with the Anabaptists
          and the Worms Colloquy; in 1558 the edict against Schwenckfeld
          and the Anabaptists, and the Frankfort Recess; in 1559 the plan
          for a synod of those who were related to the Augsburg Confession
          and the Stuttgart Synod, to protect Brenz's doctrine of the
          Lord's Supper against Calvinistic tendencies; in 1563 and 1569
          the struggle against Calvinism in the Palatinate (Maulbronn
          Colloquy) and the crypto-Calvinistic controversies. The attack
          of the Dominican Peter a Soto upon the Württemberg Confession in
          his Assertio fidei (Cologne, 1562) led Brenz to reply with his
          Apologia confessionis (Frankfort, 1555). In 1558 he was engaged
          in a controversy with Bishop Hosius of Ermland. The development
          of the Reformation in the Palatinate led the aged man to a
          vehement renewal of his negotiation with Bullinger, with whom he
          had been forced into close relation through the Interim. The
          question concerned the doctrine of the Lord's Supper and also
          involved a peculiar development of Christology, which was
          opposed by the Lutheran theologians outside of Württemberg,
          since Brenz carried to its logical conclusion the concept of
          "personal union," thus favoring an absolute omnipresence
          (ubiquity) of the body of Christ, which did not begin with the
          ascension but with the incarnation.

    6. Later Years.

          Brenz took a lively interest in the Waldensians and the French
          Protestants. But all efforts in behalf of the latter, the
          journey of the Württemberg theologians to Paris to advise King
          Antony of Navarre in 1561 (see [524]Beurlin, Jakob), the meeting
          of the duke and Brenz with Cardinal Guise of Lorraine at Zabern,
          the correspondence and the sending of writings, all ended in
          bitter disappointment. The Protestants of Bavaria, who had to
          suffer under Albert, also had his full sympathy. To the citizens
          of Strasburg Brenz expressed his doubts as to the advisability
          of following the procession with the monstrance and advised them
          not to attend mass. He was also deeply interested in the
          Protestants in Austria, for whom the first Slavic books were
          then printed at Urach. His last Reformatory activity was the
          correspondence with Duke William of Jülich and Julius of
          Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel (1568-69). In addition to this he
          continued his exposition of the Psalms and other Biblical books,
          which he had commenced at Stuttgart. In 1569 he was paralyzed,
          and his strength was broken. He was buried beneath the pulpit of
          the cathedral; but the Jesuits demolished his grave.

   Brès, Guy de (Guido de Bray)
          BRÈS, brê, GUY DE (Guido de Bray): Reformer in the Netherlands;
          b. at Mons 1522; executed at Valenciennes May 31, 1567. He was
          brought up strictly by his Roman Catholic mother, but before his
          twenty-fifth year had become a thorough Protestant. When
          persecution broke out in 1548, he fled to England, where he
          spent four years. Then he came back and settled at Ryssel
          (Liége), where he won great popularity as a preacher. In 1556
          his congregation was dispersed by a fresh persecution, and he
          was obliged to flee, going apparently for a while to Ghent, then
          to Frankfort, and probably to Switzerland. Early in 1559 he
          returned to the southern Netherlands, with Tournai for his
          headquarters, but serving also Ryssel and Valenciennes, and
          visiting Antwerp and Mons in the cause of his religion, often in
          disguise for safety's sake. The public singing of Marot's psalms
          in Sept., 1561, gave rise to a judicial investigation, which
          exposed Brès to fresh danger. Undaunted, he undertook to secure
          justice for his comrades by laying before the authorities his
          confession of faith (known as the [525]Belgic Confession, in
          thirty-seven articles, on the model of that adopted by the
          French Reformed churches in 1559. This modest, sober, positive
          statement, which he hoped would show the authorities that his
          friends were not revolutionary Anabaptists, failed to stop the
          persecution; but the frequent editions of it show that it met
          with popular approval; it won thousands to the cause of the
          Reformation, and was soon recognized as a standard formula. Once
          known, however, as its author, the Reformer was obliged to
          escape from Tournai to Amiens, and thence possibly to Antwerp.
          In 1564 he was in Brussels for a conference with William of
          Orange, and took part in the negotiations at Metz for a union of
          the Lutherans and Calvinists. Then he found a refuge at Sédan
          with Henri Robert de la Marck, Sieur de Bouillon, but was called
          back to a post of danger in the summer of 1566 by the consistory
          of Antwerp. In August he settled at Valenciennes, where by this
          time more than two-thirds of the inhabitants were in sympathy
          with the Reformation. At first he preached in the open air, but
          after the iconoclastic outbreak of Aug. 24 took possession of
          St. John's church. The governor's attempts to suppress the
          movement led to the siege of the city in December, and its
          surrender in the following March. Once more Brès was forced to
          flee, but he and his fellow preachers were captured a few hours
          later at Saint-Amand, and sent as prisoners to Tournai and then
          back to Valenciennes. The letters which he wrote to comfort his
          wife and his aged mother give an insight into his faith and the
          nobility of his character. He was sentenced to be hanged in
          front of the town hall, and thus ended a life full of toil and
          peril, which is one of the glories of the Reformation in the
          southern Netherlands.

   Breslau, Bishopric of
          BRESLAU, BISHOPRIC OF: A diocese which is shown to be already in
          existence at the date of the foundation of the archbishopric of
          Gnesen (1000). Probably it was established not long before that
          date, presumably not by Otto III, but by Duke Boleslav Chrobry
          of Poland. The original extent of the diocese can not be
          determined, but in later times it was nearly coextensive with
          the present province of Silesia, including also the Meissen
          district on the western side of the Queis.

          (A. Hauck.)

          A line of unusually excellent bishops administered the see with
          success until the sixteenth century; but Jacob von Salza
          (1520-39) was too weak to stand against the rising tide of the
          Reformation, and his successor, Balthasar von Promnitz, was even
          inclined to Lutheran doctrines. From 1608 to 1664 the see was
          occupied by three archdukes of Austria and a prince of Poland,
          who had little care for religion, and when Silesia came under
          Frederick II of Prussia Protestantism was still more encouraged.
          In 1821 the diocese, which is now partly in Germany and partly
          in Austria and numbers about two million souls, was made an
          exempt bishopric.

          theologian; b. at Gersdorf (40 m. e. of Dresden), Saxony, Feb.
          11, 1776; d. at Gotha Jan. 22, 1848; studied at Leipsic;
          appointed minister at Schneeberg, 1807, superintendent at
          Annaberg, 1808, and superintendent-general at Gotha, 1816. Ha
          was a prolific writer and took an active part in controversies.
          Among, his principal works may be mentioned: Lexicon manuale
          Græco-Latinum in libros Novi Testamenti (Leipsic, 1824; 3d ed.,
          1840); Systematische Entwickelung aller in der Dogmatik
          vorkommenden Begriffe (1805; 4th ed., 1841); Handbuch der
          Dogmatik (1814; 4th ed., 1838). He founded the series of
          reprints called the Corpus reformatorum (Halle, 1834 sqq.), in
          which the works of Melanchthon and Calvin have appeared, to
          which Zwingli will be added. His standpoint was that of the
          so-called rational supernaturalism--a rather untenable ground
          between rationalism and supernaturalism.

   Breviary
          BREVIARY: The name of the Roman Catholic service-book containing
          what is called the "divine office" or the services for the
          canonical hours, as distinguished from the missal, which
          contains the altar-service, and the ritual, which has the rites
          for the administration of the sacraments, etc. It is a
          practically arranged, well-divided collection of prayers with
          numerous brief extracts from Scripture, and the Fathers and
          ancient hymns. From the subdeacon upward every Roman cleric is
          bound to recite the whole office daily.

    The Canonical Hours.

          The breviary is based on the idea of realizing, in the spirit of
          the Church, at least symbolically, the apostolic command to
          "pray without ceasing"; the whole life of the Christian is to
          appear as a continuous prayer, not only in heart and works, but
          also in words; at all hours and places of the earth the prayer
          of the Church is to ascend to God. The custom of the synagogue
          (Dan. vi, 10, 13; Ps. iv, 18) in regard to morning and evening
          hours (I Chron. xxiv, 30) as well as other times of prayer (Ps.
          cxix, 62, 64) was taken as a standard. At first there were the
          three hours, the third, sixth, and ninth, or 9 A.M., noon, and 3
          P.M. (cf. Acts ii, 15, 46; iii, 1; x, 9). To these were added
          midnight, the hour when Paul and Silas prayed in the prison
          (Acts xvi, 25), and the beginning of the day and the night. This
          arrangement of prayer is mentioned in Tertullian, Cyprian,
          Justin Martyr, Clement of Alexandria, and the Apostolic
          Constitutions. In the fourth century, Athanasius (De
          virginitate, xii-xx) knows of seven hours; Gregory Nazianzen
          speaks with approval of the nightly vigils and the antiphonal
          singing. All these hours were adopted in the monasteries
          especially, as Jerome (Epist., vii, cviii, cxxx), Basil, and
          Augustine attest. From the monasteries these hours of prayer
          (called canonical as a part of canonical life) spread to the
          cathedral and collegiate chapters. Benedict added the seventh
          (compline, completorium), and since the sixth century the order
          and number of hours have not varied. The day-hours are prime
          (normally at 6 A.M.), terce (9 A.M.), sext (noon), none (3
          P.M.), and vespers (6 P.M.); nowadays compline and lauds are
          usually reckoned with them. (See the articles under these
          titles.)

          Matins, answering to the three Roman vigils, is divided into
          three nocturnes, and was originally followed by the present
          lauds.

    Sources and Revisions of the Breviary.

          The bulk of the prayers for all these hours was taken from the
          Psalms, to which antiphons were added, giving the psalms a
          special meaning appropriate to the occasion. Afterward collects
          were added, which were intended to prevent distraction and
          excite devotion, and are accordingly brief. The posture varied
          between standing, sitting, and kneeling. The whole structure was
          enriched and completed by the addition of other prayers,
          responsories, versicles, etc. The musical element was provided
          for by official books known as antiphonaries, especially that
          composed under Gregory I, and the so-called Micrologus (twelfth
          century). Cassian attests that each three psalms at matins were
          followed by three lessons, taken from Scripture, on Sunday only
          from the New Testament; later on the lives of the saints and
          exegetical passages from the most prominent teachers of the
          Church were inserted. The introduction of metrical hymns was
          long opposed (Council of Braga, 553), especially in Rome. So
          many arbitrary additions made the offices too long, and Gregory
          VII reduced them; other revisions were made under Gregory IX,
          Clement VII, who had the assistance of the Franciscan general,
          Cardinal (Quignonez (1536), Clement VIII (1602), and Urban VIII
          (1631). The late Vatican Council also introduced some changes.

    Contents of the Roman Breviary.

          At present the Roman breviary, which has at last succeeded in
          supplanting the many local or diocesan uses, consists of four
          parts, corresponding, to the four seasons of the year. Each part
          again has four divisions: (1) The psalter, or ordinary week-day
          service for each day and hour; (2) the "proper of the season,"
          the service for the festivals of Christ and the Sundays of the
          various seasons; (3) the "proper of saints," the special service
          for the festivals of particular saints; and (4) the "common of
          saints," providing, under separate classes, services for those
          saints who have no special one. Appendices contain the office
          for the dead, the gradual and penitential psalms, prayers for
          the dying and for travelers, and grace before and after meals.

          The analogous service-book in the Greek Church is called
          Horologium. In the Evangelical Church a similar service was
          often retained in cathedral and collegiate chapters, for which
          Luther's suggestions of 1523 and 1526 furnished a basis. The
          matins and vespers were especially retained. Attempts have
          lately been made, with varying success, to restore the other
          hours; but the problem can not be considered as solved. The
          Anglican Church, in its Book of Common Prayer, has made skilful
          use of important portions from the ancient order.

          M. Herold.

          The calendar of the Roman breviary is a complicated affair,
          especially since the multiplication of festivals in the last two
          or three centuries. These are classed as double or simple. The
          simple form the lowest class, and have no second vespers. The
          double (so called from the antiphons being doubled, or recited
          entire both before and after the psalms and canticles at lauds
          and vespers) are classed in order of importance as doubles of
          the first class (with or without an octave), second class,
          greater, and lesser. Where two feasts occur, i.e., fall on the
          same day, or concur, i.e., the first vespers of one conflict
          with the second vespers of the other, the difficulty is met,
          according to detailed rules based on the rank of the feasts,
          either by "transferring" the less important to the first
          unoccupied day, or by "commemorating" it with the recitation of
          its chief antiphon, versicle and response, and collect, after
          the collect for the day at lauds and vespers.

          School, Middletown, Conn. (1872). He was a tutor at Yale in
          1870-71, was ordered deacon in 1872, and was advanced to the

          bishop-coadjutor of Connecticut, and became bishop in 1899. His
          theological position is that of a High-churchman with liberal
          sympathies. He has written The Key of Life (New York, 1894);

   Brewster, William
          BREWSTER, WILLIAM: Leader of the "Pilgrim Fathers"; b. of good
          family probably at Scrooby (37 m. s. of York), Nottinghamshire,
          England, 1560; d. at Plymouth, Mass., Apr. 10, 1644. He
          matriculated at Peterhouse, Cambridge, but apparently did not
          graduate. From 1584 till 1587 he was in the service of William
          Davison, ambassador to the Low Countries and afterward secretary
          of state. About 1587 he retired to Scrooby, where he lived in
          the manor-house and was keeper of the post, a position of
          considerable importance at that time. He was a prominent member
          of a separatist congregation of which [528]Richard Clifton was
          pastor, holding its meetings regularly at Brewster's house.
          Because of persecution in England they made an unsuccessful
          attempt to flee to Holland in 1607, and in 1608 escaped to
          Amsterdam with [529]John Robinson as "teacher" and Brewster as
          "elder." In 1609 they settled at Leyden, where Brewster, having
          exhausted his means, gave lessons in English and also set up a
          printing-press. He favored the emigration to America, was
          influential in securing a grant of land in 1619, and sailed with
          the first company in the Mayflower, Sept., 1620. He continued as
          elder of the congregation at Plymouth, and preached regularly
          until the first ordained minister, Ralph Smith, came in 1629,
          but as he was not ordained, he never administered the
          sacraments. See [530]Congregationalists, I, 1, §§ 5-7; [531]4,

   Briconnet, Guillaume
          BRICONNET, brî´´sen´´nê´, GUILLAUME: French prelate; b. at Paris
          1470; d. at Esmans (near Montereau, 20 m. e.s.e. of Melun) Jan.
          24, 1534. He was a descendant of a noble family of Touraine,
          and, after completing his theological studies at the college of
          Navarre, was appointed bishop of Lodève and was also made abbot
          of St. Germain-des-Près in 1507. Four years later he attended
          the Council of Pisa, and during his absence a spirit of
          licentiousness spread among his monks, whom he was unable to
          control. Francis I then appointed him bishop of Meaux and sent
          him on a mission to Rome, where he remained two years. On his
          return, he sought to improve the morals and customs of his
          diocese, and accordingly convoked several synods, and also
          extended invitations to a number of evangelical preachers, such
          as Lefèvre, Roussel, and Farel, who preached in thirty-two
          different places in his diocese, and introduced French
          translations of the Gospels and Epistles. When Farel attacked
          Rome, however, Briconnet deprived him of his office and convoked
          two synods, the first condemning the teachings of Luther and
          forbidding the purchase or the reading of his works, and the
          second prohibiting all heterodox interpretations of the Gospel.
          Briconnet found himself between two factions; one turning
          against Rome by denying the authority of the pope, the worship
          of the Virgin and of the saints; and the other clinging to the
          old traditions. In his effort to avoid extremes, he published
          certain proclamations between Dec., 1524, and Jan., 1525,
          threatening to excommunicate those who had burned the bull of
          Clement VII and destroyed images of the Virgin. Notwithstanding
          this, he was charged by the Cordeliers before the Parliament of
          Paris with being in sympathy with the Lutherans (Mar.,
          1525-Oct., 1526), whereupon a commission ordered that Lefèvre's
          translations be burned, and forbade evangelical preaching. The
          preachers accordingly fled to Strasburg, although Briconnet
          himself was acquitted. Taking advantage of the absence of
          Francis I, who was held captive in Madrid, the Cordeliers
          renewed their charges, and two of the new preachers, Jacobus
          Pauvan and Matthæus Saunier, were convicted of heresy by the
          Sorbonne and burned at the stake. Briconnet wrote a letter of
          submission to the Parliament, and Francis quashed the case. His
          works were as follows: Synodalis oratio (Paris, 1520); Synodalis
          oratio (1552); and a correspondence with Margaret of Navarre,
          some of which, with other fragments, is contained in Génin,
          Lettres de Marguerite d'Angoulême (1841) and Nouvelles lettres
          de la reine de Navarre (1842), and Herminjard, Correspondance
          des réformateurs (Geneva, 1878).

   Brictinans
          BRICTINANS (Brittinans, Brittinians, so named from S. Blasius de
          Brictinis, a desolate region not far from Fano in Umbria): An
          Italian hermit-society founded during the pontificate of Gregory
          IX, who confirmed it in 1234 by an edict, enjoining upon the
          members the most rigorous asceticism, especially as to fasting
          and the total abstinence from flesh in any form between Sept. 14
          and Easter of every year. Innocent IV sought, apparently with
          success, to merge them, as well as the anchorite orders of the
          [532]Williamites and [533]John-Bonites, in the new order of the
          [534]Augustinians. A bull of Alexander IV, however, dated in
          1260 (Potthast, Regesta, no. 17,915), assures them the right of
          independent existence.

          at Chusclan (15 m. n.n.w. of Avignon), Department of Gard, Mar.
          21, 1701; d. at Roquemaure, near Avignon, Dec. 22, 1767. He
          studied at the Jesuit College and the Mission Seminary of St.
          Charles de la Croix in Avignon; visited as a missionary preacher
          or evangelist nearly every city and village of France, producing
          a profound impression by his somber and vehement sermons. He
          almost always preached extemporaneously, appealed to the
          emotions of his hearers, and sought to terrify them. He prepared
          a volume of Cantiques spirituels (Montpellier, 1748), which has
          passed through fifty editions. Certain works have been published
          from his manuscripts, including Lectures et méditations
          (Avignon, 1821); Réglement de vie pour une pieuse demoiselle
          (1821); and five volumes of sermons (1823).

          faculty of the Free Church of the same institution, being
          graduated from the former in 1870 and from the latter in 1876.
          He also studied at the University of Göttingen, and after the
          completion of his education held successive pastorates in the
          Canton of Vaud (1875-78), Paris (1879-87), and Lausanne
          (1887-94). Since 1894 he has been professor of philosophy and

          Church at Lausanne. He has been associate editor of the Revue de
          théologie et de philosophie since 1895 and of the Liberté
          chrétienne since 1898. In theology he is, to a certain extent, a
          follower of C. Secrétan and A. R. Vinet, and has written La
          Philosophie de la religion d'Immanuel Kant (Lausanne, 1876); La

          BRIDGE, WILLIAM: Puritan; b. in Cambridgeshire about 1600; d. at
          Clapham, near London, Mar. 12, 1670. He was a fellow of Emmanuel
          College, Cambridge, and, as rector at Norwich, was silenced by
          Bishop Wren for nonconformity (1637), and excommunicated; he
          remained in Norwich, however, till the writ de excommunicato
          capiendo came out against him, when he fled to Holland and
          became pastor of the English Church at Rotterdam, succeeding
          Hugh Peters and associated with Jeremiah Burroughs; he returned
          to England in 1642 and was a member of the Westminster Assembly;
          was minister at Great Yarmouth till ejected in 1662, and spent
          the rest of his life at Clapham. He was an Independent
          (Congregationalist) and Calvinist, a learned man, and had a
          library rich in the Fathers and schoolmen. His collected works
          in three volumes were published at London, 1649, and, with
          memorial, in five volumes, 1845.

   Bridget (Brigit, Brigida, Bride), Saint, of Kildare
          BRIDGET (Brigit, Brigida, Bride), SAINT, OF KILDARE: Patron
          saint of Ireland; b. at Fochart (Faugher, 2 m. n. of Dundalk),
          Leinster, c. 453; d. at Kildare (30 m. w.s.w. of Dublin) Feb. 1,
          523. She was the daughter of a certain Dubhthach and his
          bondmaid or concubine named Brotsech. At the age of fourteen she
          received the veil in Meath from the hand of Bishop Machille
          (Mel), and during a long life won renown for piety and
          benevolence, and as a founder of monasteries. Her first and most
          important foundation was Kildare (cill dara, so named from a
          large oak under which her cell was first placed), which was
          followed by Breagh in Meath, Hay in Connaught, Cliagh in
          Munster, and others. She was buried at Kildare, where the nuns
          of her monastery (the "fire-house") kept the so-called "St.
          Bridget's fire" continually burning in her honor till 1220, when
          the bishop of the time ordered it extinguished to make an end of
          the many superstitions connected with it. Thus far the notices
          of her life are well authenticated; but in very early times
          legend began to associate marvels of the wildest sort with her
          name--a tendency not unknown to her oldest biographers. An aged
          seer foretold her future greatness to her mother before she was
          born.

          While still a child Bridget prophesied her coming spiritual rule
          over Ireland by stretching her arms over the green fields and
          crying "it will be mine." As nun and monastery-head she performs
          numerous miracles of benevolence and love like those of Elijah
          at Zarephath and Jesus in feeding the multitude. The milk which
          she gives to a poor man, instead of making it into butter, is
          restored in a wondrous way; so likewise the bacon which she
          gives to a hungry dog instead of cooking it. She gives seven
          sheep, one after the other, to a beggar who comes to her in
          seven different forms, but the number of her flock is not
          diminished. She changes the water drawn from a spring for a sick
          man into a delicious liquor. She satisfies a whole company of
          episcopal guests with the milk of a single cow which had already
          been milked three times the same day.

          Some of her dream-miracles and visions are more credible; but
          here, on the one hand, a Roman-clerical tendency is easily
          recognized--as when she finds herself transported to Rome and
          hears a mass read there which awakens in her the desire to
          transplant the same to Ireland--and, on the other hand, we meet
          with characteristics of a benevolent nature-deity, which the
          legends mentioned above also indicate by ascribing to her
          manifold miracles connected with the giving of food and drink.
          It is thus not unlikely that the old heathen nature-goddess
          Ceridwen (the Ceres of the Celts), transformed into a Christian
          saint, survives in Bridget. The fire also which was kept burning
          in her honor at Kildare speaks for this supposition. It is said
          that the foundations of a temple of Ceridwen, with great vaults
          for the storing of fruits, have been found beneath the chapel of
          the monastery (cf. Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy, iii,
          1789, Ant., 75-85). In old Irish legend and song, Bridget is
          likened to the Virgin Mary, or even extolled as the Mary of the
          Irish by expressions such as "mother of Christ," "mother of the
          Lord," and the like. A hymn, attributed to Bishop Ultan (d. 656)
          and in any case very old, calls her "beloved queen of the true
          God," and the old Officium S. Brigidæ (printed at Paris, 1622)
          speaks of her as "another Mary," "like to Mary," etc. The
          monasteries, churches, and villages named after her are almost
          without number.

   Bridget, Saint, of Sweden and the Brigittine Order

  BRIDGET, SAINT, OF SWEDEN AND THE BRIGITTINE ORDER.

          Bridget's Revelations and Later Life (§ 2).

          Her Works (§ 3).

          The Brigittine Order (§ 4).

    1. Bridget's Early Life.

          Bridget, the famous Scandinavian mystic and monastic founder,
          was born probably at Finstad, not far from Upsala, in 1303; d.
          in Rome July 23, 1373. Her father, Birger Persson, was one of
          the principal landowners of the district, and charged with both
          administrative and judicial functions. Her family on both sides
          had been distinguished for religious devotion, and the child
          received a careful education in spiritual things. Her
          imagination, nourished on the lives of the saints, brought her
          her first vision at the age of seven. Others followed, the
          reality of which neither she nor her parents doubted. After her
          mother's death, Bridget was entrusted to an aunt at Aspanäs,
          whose strict discipline laid the foundation of her asceticism
          and strength of will. In 1316 she was married, in pursuance of
          her father's political plans, to Ulf, son of the governor of the
          province of Nerike, and took up her residence at Ulfåsa in that
          province, where she acquired great influence by the renown of
          her piety and unselfishness. By degrees she collected around her
          a group of devout and learned men--Nicolaus Hermanni, renowned
          as a Latin poet, and later bishop of Linköping, who was the
          instructor of her children; Matthias, her confessor, the
          foremost theologian of the time in Sweden; Prior Peter of
          Alvastra; and another Peter, who succeeded Matthias as her
          confessor. Through Matthias, who was the author of a commentary
          on Revelation, she gained an insight into the religious
          movements and the rich apocalyptic literature of the day. After
          King Magnus Ericsson's marriage with Blanche of Namur, Bridget
          became chief lady-in-waiting to the queen, and soon acquired a
          great influence at the court.

    2. Bridget's Revelations and Later Life.

          No remarkable visions of revelations seem to have marked this
          period. When, however, she was approaching the age of forty
          (probably between 1341 and 1343), she and her husband made a
          pilgrimage to the shrine of St. James at Compostella (see
          [535]Compostella). On the way back, Ulf fell ill at Arras; and
          as she watched by his bedside, she thought she saw St. Denis,
          the protector of France, who told her that she was under the
          special care of heaven. Her husband's recovery, which was
          indicated as a sign of this, was only temporary. He died in
          1344, and Bridget believed the last tie which bound her to earth
          had been broken. Not long afterward, she thought she saw Christ
          himself, who said to her: "Thou art my spouse, and the link
          between me and mankind; thou shall see and hear marvelous
          things, and my Spirit shall be upon thee all thy days." This was
          her first revelation, strictly so called. She and those around
          her were fully convinced of the reality and the divine origin of
          these revelations. She used to write or dictate them in Swedish;
          later they were somewhat freely put into Latin by Matthias, by
          Prior Peter, and after 1365 by the Spanish prelate Alphonsus,
          formerly bishop of Jaen. Bridget felt herself called to be a
          divine instrument for the religious and moral awakening of her
          age. Soon she was convinced that she should found a new order in
          honor of the Savior, and dictated to Peter the rules revealed to
          her. King and nobles joined in building and endowing a home for
          the order; the approval of the archbishop of Upsala was secured.
          To obtain that of the pope, Bridget undertook the long journey
          to Rome in 1349, arriving in the jubilee of the following year.
          Here she spent the rest of her life, except for pilgrimages, in
          works of mercy and in warning great and small against sin. She
          did not gain the papal sanction for her order until 1370, when
          her rule was confirmed by Urban V. A pilgrimage to Palestine in
          1372 was the last notable event in her life. She was canonized
          by Boniface IX in 1391. The connection between Sweden and the
          South was much furthered by her fame and by the permanent use of
          her Roman house by monks from her convent of Vadstena (on the
          east shore of Lake Vettern, 110 m. s.w. of Stockholm); its head
          in the Reformation period was Peter Magnus, who, after his
          return to Sweden, consecrated the Lutheran bishops there,
          affording a basis for a claim to apostolic succession.

    3. Her Works.

          The authorized edition of Bridget's works contains eight books
          of revelations, besides another of Revelationes extravagantes,
          or supplement, from the collection of Prior Peter, with his own
          notes; the rule of her order; and a collection of edifying
          readings for the community, with certain prayers (known as the
          Quattuor orationes). The works were first printed at Lübeck in
          1492 from the official copy preserved at Vadstena; the Roman
          edition of 1628 is considered the best. The "Revelations" have
          been translated into most European languages and into Arabic.
          With much that is superstitious and fantastic, they contain a
          pure mysticism, rich in thought, and marked by deep insight into
          the inner mysteries of the devout life. Bridget's views are of
          course medieval and those of a submissive daughter of the Roman
          Catholic Church. None the less, they show traces of admirable
          anticipations of Reformation ideas. The conception of the
          universal priesthood appears here and there; in her personal
          devotion, she goes back to the eternal source of life and truth;
          and her rule commends the preaching of the Word to the people in
          the vernacular.

    4. The Brigittine Order.

          The Brigittine Order (Ordo Sancti Augustini sancti Salvatoris
          nuncupatus) was intended by her as an instrument for spreading
          the Kingdom of God upon earth. Its convents (as, e.g., at
          Fontévraud) were for both monks and nuns, though their dwellings
          were separate. The age of entrance was twenty-five for men and
          eighteen for women. The convent was to be ruled by an abbess
          selected by the community. Originally the monks were governed by
          a prior independent of the abbess, but before long the pope
          subjected them also to her rule, the former prior being called
          only confessor-general. At the same time they were placed under
          immediate papal jurisdiction, though provision was made for a
          yearly visitation by the bishop. They were strictly cloistered;
          silence was observed, except at certain hours, but the rule of
          fasting was not rigorous. The monks were admitted to the nuns'
          convent only to administer the sacraments to the dying or to
          carry out the dead. The rich endowments of the convent of
          Vadstena, which remained the mother house, show the popularity
          of this national foundation among all classes. Not a few
          Brigittine convents, however, sprang up in other countries,
          prominent among which were Nådendal in Finland, Munkaliv near
          Bergen, Mariendal near Revel, Marienwald near Lübeck, Marienkron
          near Stralsund, and Sion House, Richmond, near London. The
          importance of the order during the later Middle Ages for the
          civilization of the North, and especially of Sweden, can hardly
          be overestimated. Vadstena has been called the first high-school
          of the North; on it and on its daughter house at Nådendal the
          literary life of Sweden before the Reformation depended.
          Vadstena had the largest library in Sweden; and here were made
          the first attempts toward a complete Swedish version of the
          Bible. In 1495 a printing-press was set up; but it was destroyed
          by fire the same year, and published nothing so far as known.

          The order was so deeply rooted in Sweden that it survived the
          Reformation, though with diminished strength. Not even Gustavus
          Vasa's hatred of the "popery" of the Brigittines could entirely
          destroy the devotion of all classes to them. During the
          sixteenth century his wife, sons, and daughters, and many others
          of the highest nobility, as well as numbers from other classes
          are found among the benefactors of Vadstena, which, however, was
          suppressed by Duke Charles in 1595. The Reformation abolished
          most of the houses outside of Sweden, but an attempt was made to
          revive it in the Counterreformation, to which period belong the
          Fratres novissimi Birgittini in Belgium, confirmed by Gregory
          XV, and the reformed order for women introduced only into Spain
          by the visionary Marina de Escobar (d. 1633) and confirmed by
          Urban VIII. This is said to have a few houses in Spain now; and
          four convents of the original order still exist--at Altomünster
          in Bavaria, St. Bridget's Abbey in Devonshire, and two in
          Holland.

   Bridgett, Thomas Edward
          BRIDGETT, THOMAS EDWARD: English Roman Catholic; b. at Derby (35
          m. n.n.e. of Birmingham), Derbyshire, Jan. 20, 1829; d. at
          Clapham (a suburb of London) Feb. 17, 1899. His parents were
          Baptists, but in 1845 he was baptized into the Church of
          England. Two years later he matriculated at St. John's College,
          Cambridge, but just before taking his degree in 1850 he refused
          to take the oath of supremacy and was received into the Roman
          Catholic Church. He then studied for six years on the Continent,
          and was ordained priest in 1856, after having joined the
          Redemptorist Order. His life-work lay in the mission field to
          which his order is particularly devoted, and in 1868 he
          established the Confraternity of the Holy Family connected with
          the Redemptorist church at Limerick, Ireland. In addition to his
          activity as a missioner, he wrote The Ritual of the New
          Testament (London, 1873); Our Lady's Dowry, or, how England
          Gained and Lost that Title (1875); The Discipline of Drink
          (1876); History of the Holy Eucharist in Great Britain (2 vols.,
          1881); Life of Blessed John Fisher, Bishop of Rochester (1888);
          The True Story of the Catholic Hierarchy Deposed by Queen
          Elizabeth. (in collaboration with T. F. Knox; 1889); Blunders
          and Forgeries: Historical Essays (1890); The Life and Writings
          of Sir Thomas More (1891); and Sonnets and Epigrams on Sacred
          Subjects (1898). He likewise edited a number of works, of which
          the most important were Bishop T. Watson's Sermons on the
          Sacraments (London, 1876); R. Johnson's The Suppliant of the
          Holy Ghost (1878); Cardinal W. Allen's Souls Departed (1886);
          The Wit and Wisdom of Blessed Thomas More (1892); Lyra
          Hieratica: Poems on the Priesthood (1896); Poems on England's
          Reunion with Christendom (1896); and Characteristics from the
          Writings of Nicholas Cardinal Wiseman (1898).

   Bridgewater Treatises
          BRIDGEWATER TREATISES: A series of books written in accordance
          with the will of Francis Henry, eighth earl of Bridgewater (d.
          Feb. 11, 1829), who left eight thousand pounds to the Royal
          Society, to be paid to one or several authors, selected by the
          president, for writing a treatise "On the power, wisdom, and
          goodness of God, as manifested in the Creation." The following
          eight authors were selected, and their treatises published (12
          vols., London, 1833-36): (1) Thomas Chalmers, The Adaptation of
          External Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Condition of Man;
          (2) John Kidd, The Adaptation of External Nature to the Physical
          Condition of Man; (3) William Whewell, Astronomy and General
          Physics considered with Reference to Natural Theology; (4)
          Charles Bell, The Hand, its Mechanism and Vital Endowments as
          Evincing Design; (5) Peter Mark Roget, Animal and Vegetable
          Physiology considered with Reference to Natural Theology; (6)
          William Buckland, Geology and Mineralogy considered with
          Reference to Natural Theology; (7) William Kirby, The Habits and
          Instincts of Animals with Reference to Natural Theology; (8)

          BRIDGMAN, ELIJAH COLEMAN: Congregational foreign missionary; b.
          at Belchertown, Mass., Apr. 22, 1801; d. in Shanghai, China,
          Nov. 2, 1861. He was graduated at Amherst College in 1826 and at
          Andover Theological Seminary in 1829 and that year on October 14
          sailed for Canton under the appointment of the American Board.
          He arrived there on Feb. 25, 1830, and lived there till 1847,
          when he removed to Shanghai to supervise the translation of the
          Bible. In 1832 he began, as a labor of love, the valuable
          monthly The Chinese Repository and was its editor till 1851. In
          1841 he brought out his Chinese chrestomathy. In 1844 he was one
          of the two secretaries of legation to Hon. Caleb Cushing when on
          his special mission to China and rendered important services. In
          February, 1852, he left Shanghai for a visit to America, arrived
          there June 16; on his return he left New York on October 12, and
          arrived at Shanghai on May 3, 1853.

   Briefs, Bulls, and Bullaria
          BRIEFS, BULLS, AND BULLARIA: Written mandates of the pope,
          differing in form, the bull being more solemn than the brief;
          bullaria are collections of both kinds of documents. At first
          the Roman bishops sealed documents with a ring, but from the end
          of the sixth century seal-boxes or seal-forms (bullæ), usually
          of lead, began to be attached to all public documents, whereas
          for the others the signet stamped in wax by the ring was used.
          Since the thirteenth century it has borne the same device, the
          apostle Peter casting a net into the sea (Matt. iv, 18, 19),
          whence it is known as the "ring of the fisherman" ([536]annulus
          piscatoris). The oldest bullæ have on one side the name of the
          pope, on the other the word Papa. The present form has on the
          obverse the heads of Peter and Paul with the distinguishing
          inscription S. P. A.--S. P. E. (i.e., Sanctus Petrus or Paulus
          Apostolus, Sanctus Petrus or Paulus Episcopus); on the reverse,
          the name of the pope with his number. The string by which they
          are attached is of red and yellow silk or hemp. From designating
          the seal, the word bulla passed to the document itself.

          The bull is written upon strong parchment; the brief on thin
          parchment or paper. Instead of having the seal attached to it,
          it is issued sub annulo piscatoris, which to-day is only a stamp
          on the paper. Both begin in an invariable form with the name of
          the pope and a salutation. In the brief the number is added to
          the name, in the bull the title Episcopus servus servorum Dei
          takes the place of the number. At the close of the brief merely
          the place and date are given; the bull gives the date according
          to both the ancient Roman and the Christian calendars and the
          year of the pope's reign. The most solemn form is used for bulls
          issued in the consistory (bullæ consistoriales). They are signed
          by the pope and the cardinals, and are sent out not in the
          original but in an authorized copy (transcriptum). Of other
          bulls (non consistoriales) the pope signs only the minute
          (minuta), and the completed document is signed by the various
          papal officers who helped in its preparation. The briefs are
          signed only by the secretary of briefs. Briefs are drawn up in
          accordance with the special rules of the department in the
          apostolic secretariate or dataria (see [537]Curia); bulls in the
          chancery. Leo XIII simplified the procedure in 1878 by ordering
          that bulls other than consistorial should be written in ordinary
          script on parchment and sealed only with a red stamp containing
          the pictures of Peter and Paul and the name of the reigning
          pope.

          The more important briefs and bulls are contained in collections
          known as bullaria. The oldest collections contained mostly only
          a small number. To these belong: Bullæ diversorum pontificorum a
          Joanne XXII ad Julium III a bibliotheca Ludovici Gomes (Rome,
          1550), containing only some fifty documents; another from
          Boniface VIII to Paul IV (1559), with about a hundred and sixty;
          and one from Gregory VII to Gregory XIII (1579), with 723
          documents. The Magnum bullarium Romanum, covering the period
          from Leo I to the year 1585, was published in 1586, and since
          has been continued in revised and completed editions. The latest
          as well as most convenient and complete edition is the Bullarium
          magnum Romanum, published at Turin by order of Pius IX and under
          the auspices of Cardinal Gaude (1857-72, 24 vols., covering the
          years 440-1740). For delimiting bulls (bullæ circumscriptionis),
          see [538]Concordats and Delimiting Bulls.

          Greifswald, Erlangen, and Tübingen from 1861 to 1864 (Ph.D.,
          Leipsic, 1870). He became privat-docent at Halle in 1870, and
          was appointed associate professor of church history in the same
          university three years later. In 1876 he was called to Marburg
          as full professor of the same subject, and since 1886 has been
          professor of church history at Leipsic. In addition to numerous
          contributions to theological periodicals, he has written Gasparo

   Briessmann, Johann
          BRIESSMANN, brîs´m??n, JOHANN: Reformer; b. at Cottbus (on the
          Spree, 43 m. s.s.w. of Frankfort), Brandenburg, Dec. 31, 1483;
          d. at Königsberg Oct. 1, 1549. He belonged to a prominent
          family, and as a Franciscan he studied after 1518 at
          Frankfort-on-the-Oder, and after 1520 at Wittenberg, where he
          was promoted in 1521 as licentiate and in 1522 as doctor of
          theology. Influenced by Luther's appearance at the Leipsic
          disputation with Eck (1519), but more especially by Luther's
          great reformatory writings of the year 1520, he soon found
          himself one in the Evangelical faith with his beloved friend.
          When the Franciscans had to leave Wittenberg, Briessmann went to
          Cottbus, but on the initiative of Luther he was able to return
          in 1522. He addressed a reformatory epistle to the congregation
          at Cottbus, Unterricht und Ermahnung (Cottbus, 1523), and at the
          instance of Luther wrote a powerful refutation of the attacks of
          the Franciscan Schatzgeyer upon Luther's De votis monasticis
          (Wittenberg?, 1523), stating in his declaration to Spalatin that
          he could not refuse the wish of Luther, "since he felt himself
          in agreement not so much with a Luther as with the Evangelical
          truth."

    Preacher in Königsberg, 1523-27.

          On the recommendation of Luther, he was called in 1523 as
          preacher to Königsberg by Albert, the grand master of the
          Teutonic order (see [539]Albert of Prussia). A Königsberg
          chronicler thus describes his life and work: he preached the
          word with gentleness but with all seriousness; many became pious
          Christians and better men; "on account of his godly, honorable,
          moral life he was beloved by many and his sermons were gladly
          heard." About the time when he entered upon his pastoral duties
          he published his Flosculi de homine interiore et exteriore de
          fide et operibus (ed. P. Tschackert, Gotha, 1887), containing
          110 verses in which, following Luther's work "Concerning
          Christian Liberty," he defends the Evangelical doctrine against
          Rome and the fanatics. His influence upon [540]Bishop George of
          Polentz is seen in the latter's sermon delivered on Christmas
          day, 1523, in which he publicly expressed his belief in the
          Evangelical teaching of justification by faith alone. As the
          bishop did not preach himself, he appointed as his substitute
          "the learned Dr. Johann Briessmann, a man well versed in the
          holy scripture." In 1524 the bishop issued his first reformatory
          mandate, enjoining the ministers to use only the German language
          in their ministerial acts, and to read Luther's writings,
          especially his translation of the Bible. Of lasting effect were
          also certain writings of Briessmann, as his Umschreibung und
          Erklärung des Vater Untsers als Anleitung zum wahrhaft
          evangelischen Gebetsleben im Gegensatz gegen die Mariengebete; a
          Sermon von dreierlei heilsamer Beichte, as guide to Evangelical
          confession in opposition to auricular confession; and his sermon
          Von der Anfechtung des Glaubens und der Hoffnung, with reference
          to the Gospel-lesson on the woman of Canaan (Matt. xv. 21-28).
          For the benefit of the more cultured members of the congregation
          he delivered lectures on the epistle to the Romans. He laid
          stress upon the inwardness of the Christian life in opposition
          to the impetuous zeal of Amandus in forcibly doing away with
          ancient usages and forms. With Luther, who greatly rejoiced over
          the rapid progress of the Reformation in Prussia, he entertained
          a lively correspondence, and on June 12, 1524, one day before
          Luther, he was married, being the first married minister of
          Prussia.

    In Riga, 1527-31.

          After the secularization of the territory of the [541]Teutonic
          Order in 1525 under Polish feudal supremacy, Briessmann and his
          colaborers, Speratus and Poliander, faithfully assisted Duke
          Albert at the diet, Dec., 1525. He accepted a call from the
          citizens of Riga to complete the reformatory movement there,
          with the consent of the duke, Oct., 1527. By preaching and
          teaching he brought about the necessary reformation and
          published in 1530 Kurze Ordnung des Kirchendienstes sammt einer
          Vorrede von Ceremonien.

    Activity in Königsberg 1531-49.

          After four years of faithful work he returned to Königsberg in
          1531 as cathedral preacher. With his colleagues he had soon to
          oppose the fanatical tendencies of Schwenckfeld, which the
          ill-advised duke had favored at first. As he labored for the
          purity of Evangelical doctrine, he also labored for the
          upbuilding of the inner life of the Church by the new
          Landesordnung (1540), by the articles concerning the appointment
          and support of the ministers (1540), by the introduction of a
          new order of marriage and divine service (1544). He recommended
          the lectio continua, or continuous reading of the whole Bible in
          divine service, thus making the congregations acquainted with
          Holy Scripture, and a thorough instruction in the catechism
          besides the preaching; he introduced church-singing by the use
          of a hymn-book, the first in Prussia. Repeated calls to Rostock
          he declined. He also devoted his energies to the development of
          the schools and higher education. He formed the plans for the
          university which was founded in 1544. During the sickness of
          Bishop Polentz in 1546, the business of the episcopal see was
          entrusted to Briessmann, and in 1547 he made a tour of
          inspection to correct abuses which still existed in the diocese.
          He opposed especially teachings brought thither by refugees from
          the Netherlands, represented by the humanist Gulielmus Gnaphæus
          (or [542]Fullonius), a sympathizer with Carlstadt. It was also
          due to Briessmann's energy that the troubles caused by the first
          rector of the university, Georg Sabinus, had no lasting
          influence. Against Andreas Osiander, whom the duke had called to
          Königsberg, he defended the genuine Lutheran doctrine and
          confession. Painful as was this Osiandrian controversy for
          Briessmann, yet he rejoiced toward the end of his life that the
          Moravian Brethren, driven from Poland by the intrigues of the
          Polish-Catholic clergy, were in 1548 received into the Prussian
          state church, after being settled in Prussia with the permission
          of the duke. In opposing the Osiandrian errors, Briessmann also
          opposed the duke who at first adhered to Osiander. To the
          suggestion of the duke to hear the opinion of churches from
          abroad, Briessmann replied: "Since the present controversy
          concerns doctrinal points which have been preached in Prussia
          for over twenty-four years, the opinion and judgment of others
          is not to be awaited." These are the last words from his mouth
          and pen, "the testament of the first Reformer of Prussia, and
          therefore especially valuable for the history of the Prussian
          Reformation" (Tschackert). In the spring of 1549 he retired from
          his arduous duties. He is buried in the choir of the cathedral
          at Königsberg.

   Briggs, Charles Augustus
          BRIGGS, CHARLES AUGUSTUS: Protestant Episcopalian; b. at New
          York City Jan. 15, 1841. He was educated at the University of
          Virginia (1857-60), Union Theological Seminary (1861-63), and
          the University of Berlin (1866-69). From 1863 to 1866 he was in
          business with his father. He was ordained to the Presbyterian
          ministry and was pastor at Roselle, N. J., from 1870 to 1874,
          when he was appointed professor of Hebrew at Union Theological
          Seminary. In 1891 he was transferred to the chair of Biblical
          theology, and since 1904 has been professor of theological
          encyclopedia and symbolics. In 1892 he was tried for heresy by
          the Presbytery of New York, but was acquitted, although in the
          following year he was suspended by the General Assembly. In 1899
          he was ordained to the priesthood in the Protestant Episcopal
          Church. He is a member of the American Oriental Society, the
          Deutsche Morgenländische Gesellschaft, and the Society of
          Biblical Literature and Exegesis. He was editor of the
          Presbyterian Review from 1880 to 1890, and collaborated with S.
          D. F. Salmond in editing the International Theological Library
          (New York, 1891 sqq.), with S. R. Driver and A. Plummer in
          editing the International Critical Commentary (1895 sqq.), and
          with F. Brown and S. R. Driver in preparing the Hebrew and
          English Lexicon of the Old Testament (12 parts, Oxford,
          1891-1906). In addition to numerous studies in various
          theological periodicals, he has written Biblical Study (New
          York, 1883); American Presbyterianism (1885); Messianic Prophecy
          (1886); Whither? A Theological Question for the Times (1889);

          following year. He was chaplain of University College from 1884
          to 1887 and assistant curate of St. John the Divine, Kennington,
          in 1887-88, while from 1884 to 1903 he was Pusey Librarian. He
          was also examiner in the Theology School in 1899-1901, and since

          1562; d. at Hawnes (5 m. s. by e. of Bedford) Aug. 24, 1607. He
          studied at Queen's College, Cambridge (B.A., 1581; M.A., 1584;
          B.D., 1591), became a fellow there in 1584, and rector of Hawnes
          in 1592. He was one of the fathers of Presbyterianism in
          England; as Thomas Cartwright says, "The bright star in the
          Church of God." He subscribed the Presbyterian Books of
          Discipline. He was a famous expositor of Revelation (Apocalypsis
          Apocalypseos, Frankfort, 1609, Heidelberg, 1612, Eng. transl., A
          revelation of the Revelation, Amsterdam, 1615, Leyden, 1616) and
          of Daniel from xi. 36 to end of xii. (Basel, 1614, which edition
          has notes on Canticles; Eng. transl., London, 1644). He opened
          up a new path in the exposition of the Apocalypse by making two
          distinct millenniums: the first, from Constantine until 1300, in
          this corresponding with the common orthodox view; the second,
          from 1300 to 2300, which was a new departure, by which he was
          enabled to find a place for the future conversion of the Jews,
          and a more glorious condition of the Church on earth, which he
          gains by a symbolical interpretation of Rev xxi. and xxii. His
          views greatly modified the Puritan interpretation of the
          Apocalypse, and were expounded by different writers and
          reproduced in different forms long after his death. His
          collected works appeared London, 1644.

          28, 1700. He was a follower of Pontiaan van Hattem; between 1685
          and 1699 he published about forty works of a mystical-devotional
          character, which were much read; but spiritualizing Christ to
          such a degree that the historical Christ almost disappeared, and
          the sacrifice on the cross became a mere symbol of the sacrifice
          which shall take place in us, he at last got lost in a mystical
          pantheism, far away from Christianity.

          Thomas à Kempis, who wrote his life, says that he came of a good
          family, but tells nothing further of his early life except that,
          living in the days of the great religious awakening under
          Groote's influence, he was profoundly impressed by it. He came
          into intimate personal relations with Groote and his disciples,
          and devoted himself to forwarding the "new devotion" and the
          education of the young. He was ordained priest in 1393, and not
          long afterward took charge as rector of the house for women
          founded at Deventer by Groote, "Meester Geertshuis" as it was
          commonly called (see [544]Common Life, Brethern of the). He
          introduced a strict discipline into the life of the inmates, and
          was practically the founder of the sisters whose houses
          afterward became so numerous. Under his direction the numbers
          grew so, considerably that new buildings were needed. After
          three years the church and convent were ready for occupancy; at
          first of wood, they were rebuilt of stone in 1407. The
          foundation was placed under the Windesheim chapter, who named
          Brinckerinck as its confessor. Numbering in that year twelve
          sisters and novices, by the middle of the century the community
          had grown to considerably over a hundred, including all classes.
          It was self-supporting; the sisters copied and illuminated
          manuscripts, or occupied themselves profitably in other ways
          according to their gifts. In 1408 a new house was erected at
          Diepenveen, a few miles away, in the choir of whose church
          Brinckerinck was buried. He was known far and wide for his
          popular preaching, which, according to the testimony of Rudolf
          Dier, one of his hearers, and of the Brethren of the Common
          Life, gave to all the impression that he had sat at the feet of
          Jesus. From a manuscript biography by Elizabeth of Delft, one of
          the twelve first sisters, we learn that she wrote down some of
          his sermons, and Rudolf Dier adds that out of such materials
          eight vernacular "collations" were formed, containing his
          admonitions to the sisters. These were discovered not long ago,
          and published by Moll in 1866. They read like notes of spoken
          discourses, sometimes apparently combinations of different ones.
          Like the usual "collations" of the Brethren of the Common Life,
          they were not formal sermons following a rhetorical method, but
          simple and artless talks which pass readily from one topic to an
          other, and are rich in short, pithy sentences of a kind to be
          easily understood and remembered by his hearers.

   Brixen, Bishopric of
          BRIXEN, BISHOPRIC OF: A diocese which takes its name from
          Brixen, a town of the Tyrol, situated 40 m. s.s.e, of Innsbruck.
          The present Tyrol became a part of the Roman Empire 15 A.D., and
          the rapid spread of Christianity in north Italy gives ground for
          the supposition that it penetrated comparatively early into the
          Alpine region. The earliest authentic mention of a bishopric in
          southern Rhætia, however, dates from the end of the sixth
          century. Among the bishops of Venetia and Rhætia Secunda who
          addressed a letter to the emperor Maurice in 591 appears the
          name of a certain Ingenuinus, whom Paulus Diaconus and the
          author of the Versus de ordine conprovincialium pontificum
          describe as bishop of Sabiona, the present Seben. The existence
          of the bishopric seems to have been continuous from this time.
          It embraced to the south of the Brenner the upper Eisackthal and
          the Pusterthal, to the north of the Brenner almost the whole of
          what is now the Tyrol. Probably under Otto II., the see was
          removed from Seben to Brixen; in a document of 967 Bishop
          Richpert is designated as Prihsinensis ecclesiæ episcopus.

          (A. Hauck.)

          Brixen counts among the most ancient examples of exemption from
          the secular jurisdiction, having received it from Charlemagne
          and Louis the Pious. Its territory increased largely by
          donations from successive emperors, and Frederick I. (1179) gave
          its incumbent the princely title and rights. Henceforth the
          bishops received investiture immediately from the emperor, and
          had a seat and a voice in the imperial diet. The secular
          privileges, however, were gradually absorbed by the powerful
          magnates of the Tyrol, and at the Peace of Lunéville the
          principality was formally suppressed, to be conferred the next
          year on the house of Austria. Brixen was the meeting-place in
          1080 of a council of imperialist prelates who undertook to
          depose Gregory VII. and elect Guibert of Ravenna pope in his
          place. Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa occupied the see from 1450 to
          1464, and Caspar Ignatius, Count Künigl (1702-1747), was among
          the greatest and most active prelates of his day. The nomination
          to the see is vested in the emperor of Austria.

          graduated at the University of Virginia 1850, and was assistant
          professor of Latin and Greek there, 1851-53, chaplain to the
          University 1855-57, pastor of the Baptist church in the place
          until, in 1859, on its organization, he became professor of the
          interpretation of the New Testament and of homiletics in the
          Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, then in Greenville, S. C.
          In 1877 the seminary was removed to Louisville, and in 1888 he
          became its president. He attained high rank as teacher,
          preacher, and scholar, and published two notable volumes in the
          field of homiletics, The Preparation and Delivery of Sermons
          (Philadelphia, 1870; 25th ed., by E. C. Dargan, New York, 1905)
          and Lectures on the History of Preaching (New York, 1876); also

          1890); Harmony of the Gospels according to the Revised Version
          (1893); Memoir of James Petigru Boyce (1893). He also prepared a
          commentary on Mark (Philadelphia, 1905), and edited and revised
          the Oxford translation of Chrysostom's homilies on Philippians,
          Colossians, and Thessalonians, with an essay on St. Chrysostom

          at Köge (20 m. s.w. of Copenhagen), Zealand, Aug. 5, 1585; d. at
          Copenhagen Apr. 19, 1652. He studied at Herlufsholm, Copenhagen,
          Leyden, and Franeker; became rector of Herlufsholm academy 1608;
          professor pædagogicus, University of Copenhagen, 1610; professor
          of Greek 1613; member of the theological faculty 1615. In 1617
          he was appointed teacher to Prince Christian, son of King
          Christian IV., but returned to the university three years later.
          At this time Denmark was disturbed by Roman Catholic propaganda,
          and Brochmand made the controversy with Rome a subject of his
          public lectures. In 1626-28 he published Controversiæ sacræ (3
          parts), a reply to Bellarmine's attacks on the Lutheran Church,
          and in 1634, at the king's order, he engaged in a polemic with
          the Jesuits, who endeavored to defend the conversion of Margrave
          Christian William of Brandenburg to Catholicism. In their final
          reply the Jesuits stigmatized Brochmand as a "disturber of the
          Roman empire, the boldest despiser of His Imperial Majesty and
          the Catholic rulers, a poisonous spider, and a degenerate
          Absalom." Against this pamphlet Brochmand delivered a series of
          lectures which after his death were collected and published
          under the title Apologiæ, speculi veritatis confutatio
          (Copenhagen, 1653). He was ordained bishop of Zealand in 1639,
          and during his long and fruitful activity in this office
          reorganized the Danish church service, especially by abolishing
          the Latin choir, and by introducing Wednesday services during
          Lent. His reputation as a dogmatist was established by his
          Universæ theologiæ systema (2 vols., 1633) in which he proved
          himself a bitter opponent, not only of the Roman Catholics, but
          also of the Reformed, whom he calls "enemies of God and of
          truth." He wrote several devotional works, of which his Sabbati
          sanctificatio for more than two centuries was a favorite
          collection of sermons with the Danish people.

          Oct. 28, 1885. He was educated at Göttingen, Jena, and Berlin,
          and after spending two years helping [549]Otto von Gerlach in
          both educational and pastoral duties in the last-named place,
          was called in 1846 to be pastor of Lassahn in the duchy of
          Lauenburg. In 1854 he became superintendent of the whole
          district, with special charge of the principal church of
          Ratzeburg. Besides the multifarious duties which occupied him
          during the next thirty years, he found time for a considerable
          literary activity. His principal work was his Homiletische
          Charakterbilder (2 vols., Berlin, 1869-1874), which is
          practically a history of preaching, especially the
          post-Reformation and German. As is natural from the character of
          his life, his writings generally are more practical than
          theoretical.

          non-conformist, he refused to accept the Anglican Liturgy. But
          previously he had become a follower of [550]Jakob Boehme the

          princess royal, Berlin (1863-65), and after his return to
          England was minister of St. James's Chapel, York Street
          (1866-75), and of Bedford Chapel (1876-94), He was appointed
          chaplain to the queen in 1872, but in 1880 he withdrew from the
          Church of England, finding himself unable to accept the orthodox
          teaching concerning miracles. Among his writings special mention

          H., July 29, 1816; d. at Philadelphia Apr. 8, 1878. He was
          licensed at Portsmouth, N. H., 1836; became pastor in West
          Amesbury, Mass., 1837; in East Cambridge, 1838; in Lowell (First

   Brooks, Phillips
          BROOKS, PHILLIPS: American preacher and bishop; b. in Boston
          Dec. 13, 1835; d. there Jan. 23, 1893. He was of distinguished
          New England ancestry, being descended on his father's side from
          John Cotton and on his mother's aide from Samuel Phillips, the
          founder of Phillips Academy, Andover. He was graduated at
          Harvard, 1855; studied at the Protestant Episcopal Theological
          School, Alexandria, Va., 1856-59; became rector of the Church of
          the Advent, Philadelphia, 1859; of Holy Trinity Church,
          Philadelphia, 1862; of Trinity Church, Boston, 1869; he was
          consecrated bishop of Massachusetts, 1891. He was one of the
          most eloquent, spiritual, successful, and highly esteemed
          clergymen of his time, and held this position both by
          intellectual power and an engaging personality. His preaching
          was preeminently the product of his own experience; he was of
          broad sympathies and tactful in his dealings with men. He was
          particularly courteous in cultivating cordial relations with
          those of other than his own denomination. He gave the Lyman
          Beecher lectures on preaching before the Yale Divinity School in
          1877 (published as Lectures on Preaching, New York, 1877), and
          was Bohlen lecturer at the Philadelphia Divinity School in 1879
          (The Influence of Jesus, 1879). He published five volumes of
          Sermons during his life (1878-90), and five have been added
          since his death (1893-1905). His Letters of Travel written to
          his family appeared in 1893, and a volume of Essays and
          Addresses, religious, literary, and social, edited by his
          brother, John Cotton Brooks, in 1894. Individual sermons,
          addressee, etc., have been printed in many forms and the number
          of books of extracts from his preaching is very large.

   Brorson, Hans Adolf
          BRORSON, HANS ADOLF: Bishop of Ribe; b. at Randrup, on the west
          coast of northern Sleswick, June 20, 1694; d. at Ribe, Jutland,
          June 3, 1764. He studied at the University of Copenhagen
          (1712-17), devoting himself more to history and literature than
          to theology, and acted as tutor in the house of an uncle at
          Lögum in Sleswick, where he caught the spirit of the religious
          revival at that time making itself felt in this province. In
          1722 he was appointed minister at Randrup, and in 1729 he was
          called as deacon to Töndern. Here he began collecting Danish
          hymns for the use of his congregation, to replace the German
          ones previously sung before and after the Danish sermon. In 1732
          he published a small volume of Christmas hymns which contains
          some of his most excellent compositions; later he published
          other booklets, and in 1739 the first edition of his Troens rare
          Klenodie ("The Faith's Rare Jewel"), a collection of 250 hymns,
          mostly translations from the German. In 1737 King Christian VI.
          appointed him dean of Ribe stift, and two years later he
          succeeded to the bishopric. Brorson was one of the greatest of
          Danish hymn-writers, and is preeminently the poet of Christmas.
          His hymns are associated with the melodies of the people, and he
          was essentially a singer for those who worship in the privacy of
          their homes. While not unable to write original hymns, it was
          especially the hymns and melodies of German Pietism that he
          transplanted into the church of Denmark. The best edition of his
          hymns is by P. A. Arland (Copenhagen, 1867).

          at Oldbury (near the border of Wales, 20 m. s.w. of Shrewsbury),
          Shropshire, 1549; d. in Tottenham, London, Aug. 4, 1612. He was
          helped in his efforts to obtain an education by [554]Bernard
          Gilpin, and became fellow of St. John's and Christ's colleges,
          Cambridge (B.A., 1570). In London he gained fame as a preacher
          of Puritan doctrine. In 1588 he published A Consent of
          Scripture, a treatise on Bible chronology; it was attacked at
          both universities and Broughton undertook lectures in its
          defense at London. In 1589 or 1590 he went to Germany and
          thenceforth spent most of his life on the Continent, where he
          disputed with Jews, Roman Catholics, and Protestants who did not
          agree with him, and wrote letters to England asking for
          appointments. His learning and ability were unquestioned, but
          his unhappy temper and bad manners prevented his advancement. He
          was long anxious to assist in preparing a new version of the
          Bible, but when the translators were appointed by King James in
          1604 he was not one of them, and when their work was done he
          made a bitter attack upon it. His writings were collected by
          Lightfoot, with the pompous title The Works of the Great
          Albionean Divine, Renowned in Many Nations for Rare Skill in
          Salem's and Athens's Tongues and Familiar Acquaintance with all
          Rabbinical Learning, Mr. Hugh Broughton (London, 1662); a sketch
          of his life is included.

   Brousson, Claude
          BROUSSON, bru´´sOn´, CLAUDE: French Protestant; b. at Nîmes
          1647; executed at Montpellier Nov. 4, 1698. He practised as a
          lawyer at Castres, Castelnaudary, and, after 1679, in Toulouse,
          and employed his talent with courage and self-sacrifice to
          defend his coreligionists against the rigorous measures of the
          government. In 1683 he was compelled to leave France and lived
          for a time in Lausanne. He visited Berlin and Holland to bring
          about a coalition between the Protestant princess against Louis
          XIV. In 1689 he returned to France and traveled through the
          southern part of the country admonishing and exhorting his
          brethren, though a price was put on his head, and he was hunted
          by the officials like a beast of prey. In 1693 he again retired
          to Lausanne, and was ordained there (1694). In 1695 he reentered
          France through Sédan, and visited most of the Reformed
          congregations north of the Loire, finally escaping through
          Franche-Comté into Switzerland. Once more, in 1697, he visited
          France, but was caught at Oloron, and sentenced to death by
          strangling. Among his works, of which a list is given in La
          France protestante, vol. iii., the most prominent are: État des
          réformés de France (The Hague, 1685); La Manne mystique du
          désert (Amsterdam, 1695); Lettres pastorales sur le cantique des
          cantiques (Delft, 1697).

   Brown, James Baldwin
          BROWN, JAMES BALDWIN: English Congregationalist; b. in London
          Aug. 19, 1820; d. there June 23, 1884. He studied at London

          Road Chapel, Derby, 1843; of Claylands Chapel, Clapham Road,
          London, 1846, and remained with this congregation till his
          death; a new church on Brixton Road (Brixton Independent Church)
          was occupied in 1870. He was distinguished for the breadth of
          his theological views and strongly opposed to Calvinism. He took
          an active interest in public movements such as the relief of the
          laboring classes during the Lancashire cotton famine. He favored
          the opening of the Crystal Palace on Sundays, and was a warm
          advocate of the admission of dissenters to the universities. He
          strenuously opposed the doctrine of conditional immortality as a
          deadly error. In 1878 he was chairman of the Congregational
          Union; at this time a movement to discover some common ground on
          which Christians of various ways of thinking might unite in
          independence of dogma and of the historic side of Christianity
          had made such progress as to call for repressive action on the
          part of the Union in the opinion of many; he strongly opposed
          such action, but was overruled and outvoted. His more important
          books were: The Divine Life in Man (London, 1859), which brought
          upon him a charge of heterodoxy; The Soul's Exodus and
          Pilgrimage (1862); The Divine Treatment of Sin (1864); The Home
          Life in the Light of its Divine Idea (1866); Idolatries, Old and
          New, their Cause and Cure (1867); The First Principles of
          Ecclesiastical Truth (1871); The Higher Life, its Reality,
          Experience, and Destiny (1874); The Doctrine of Annihilation in
          the Light of the Gospel of Love (1875); Home, its Relation to
          Man and Society (1883).

          BROWN, JOHN: The name of several Scotch ministers, the most
          noteworthy being:

          1. John Brown of Edinburgh: Scotch Burgher minister, eldest son
          of Rev. John Brown of Whitburn (21 m. w.s.w. of Edinburgh),
          Linlithgowshire (b. 1754; d. 1832), and grandson of [555]John
          Brown of Haddington; b. at Whitburn July 12, 1784; d. at
          Edinburgh Oct. 13, 1858. He studied at Edinburgh and the
          divinity hall of the Burgher Church at Selkirk; was licensed
          1805 and ordained minister of the Burgher Church of Bigger,
          Lanarkshire, 1806; became minister of the Rose Street Church,

          city 1829; was professor of exegetical theology to the United
          Associate Synod after 1834. He was strongly in favor of the
          separation of Church and State, and in 1845 was tried (and
          acquitted) before the synod on a charge of holding unsound views
          concerning the atonement. He was a fine orator and a voluminous
          writer; the most prominent of his works are: Expository
          Discourses on First Peter (3 vols., Edinburgh, 1848); Exposition
          of the Discourses and Sayings of our Lord Jesus Christ (3 vols.,
          1850); The Resurrection of Life, an exposition of I Cor. xv.
          (1852); Expository Discourses on Galatians (1853); Analytical
          Exposition of the Epistle of Paul to the Romans (1857). He was
          the father of the well-known John Brown, M.D. (b. 1810; d.
          1882), author of Rab and his Friends (Edinburgh, 1859).

          2. John Brown of Haddington: Scotch Burgher minister; b. at
          Carpow, near Abernethy (on the Frith of Tay, 6 m. s.e, of
          Perth), Perthshire, 1722; d. at Haddington (12 m. e. of
          Edinburgh) June 19, 1787. He was poor and self-taught, but
          acquired no small amount of learning; was a herd-boy, pedler,
          soldier, and school-teacher; studied theology under Ebenezer
          Erskine and James Fisher of Glasgow; was licensed in 1750, and
          in 1751 settled as pastor of the Burgher branch of the Secession
          Church of Haddington, where he remained till his death,
          declining a call as professor of divinity in Queen's College, N.
          J. After 1768 he was professor of theology to the Associate
          Synod. His yearly income from his church never exceeded £50, and
          his professorship had no salary; nevertheless he brought up a
          large family, gave freely in charity, and wrote books (which
          brought him no pecuniary profit) not only popular but valuable.
          They include: Two Short Catechisms Mutually Connected
          (Edinburgh, 1764); A Dictionary of the Bible (2 vols., 1769;
          revised ed., 1868); The Self-interpreting Bible (2 vols., 1778;
          often reprinted); and A Compendious History of the Church of
          England and of the Protestant Churches in Ireland and America (2
          vols., Glasgow, 1784; new edition by Thomas Brown, Edinburgh,
          1823).

          1849 till his death. He prepared (1833) and revised (1852) the
          "New Hampshire [Baptist] Confession of Faith." His most
          important literary work was the Encyclopædia of Religious
          Knowledge (Brattleboro, 1835).

   Brown, Peter Hume
          BROWN, PETER HUME: Scotch historian, layman; b. at Haddington
          (18 m. e. of Edinburgh), Haddingtonshire, Dec. 17, 1850. He was
          educated at Edinburgh University (M.A., 1873), and had
          originally intended to enter the Church. He gave up this plan,
          however, and ultimately turned his attention to history. In 1898
          he was made editor of the Register of the Privy Council of
          Scotland, and three years later was appointed to his present
          position of professor of ancient (Scottish) history and
          paleography in the University of Edinburgh. He has written:

   Brown, Phoebe Allen (Hinsdale)
          BROWN, PHOEBE ALLEN (HINSDALE): Hymn-writer; b. at Canaan,
          Columbia County, N. Y., May 1, 1783; d. at Marshall, Henry
          County, Ill., Oct. 10, 1861. She was left an orphan at the age
          of two, and in early life suffered great hardship and even cruel
          treatment at the hands of strangers; she first learned to write
          at the age of eighteen. In 1805 she married Timothy Brown (d.
          1853) and moved to East Windsor, Conn. In 1813 the family went
          to the neighboring village of Ellington, and in 1818 to Monson,
          Mass. Her husband was a village mechanic, the family was poor,
          and her life was hampered by care; nevertheless she read much,
          kept up systematic Bible study, and found money to devote to
          Christian work, especially to the cause of missions. She wrote
          for her own amusement, but published newspaper articles, tracts,
          and a volume of tales, The Tree and its Fruits (New York, 1836);
          she left an autobiography in manuscript. Her best known hymn,



          "I love to steal awhile away

           From every cumbering care,"

          is said to have been written at Ellington at a time when poverty
          and domestic duties left little opportunity for meditation at
          home and she was in the habit of going out for a walk every day
          at dusk; some thoughtless remarks of neighbors being reported to
          her, she wrote "An Apology for my Twilight Rambles." The second
          line originally read "From little ones and care." The poem was
          first printed (abridged and revised) in Nettleton's Village
          Hymns (New York, 1824). The tune "Monson," to which it is often
          sung, was written by her son, [556]Samuel Robbins Brown.

   Brown, Samuel Robbins
          BROWN, SAMUEL ROBBINS: The first American appointed missionary
          to Japan; b. at East Windsor, Conn., June 16, 1810, son of
          [557]Phoebe (Hinsdale) Brown; d. at Monson, Mass., June 20,
          1880. He was graduated at Yale, 1832; studied at the Theological
          School, Columbia, S. C., 1835-37, and at Union Theological
          Seminary, New York, 1837-38; went to China in 1838 and took
          charge of a school founded and maintained by the Morrison
          Education Society (see [558]Morrison, Robert), located first at
          Macao, in 1842 removed to Hongkong. He returned to America in
          1847 bringing with him three Chinese boys, one of whom was Yung
          Wing, afterward at the head of the Chinese Education Commission;
          he taught at Rome, N. Y., 1848-51, and was pastor of the
          Reformed (Dutch) Church and principal of a successful school at
          Owasco Outlet (Sand Beach), near Auburn, N. Y., 1851-59; was one
          of the incorporators (1851) and first chairman of the executive
          committee of Elmira College, the first chartered woman's college
          in America. In May, 1859, he sailed for Japan as missionary of
          the Reformed (Dutch) Church, and located at Kanagawa till 1863,
          when he removed to Yokohama; returned to America in 1867 and for
          two years preached for his old church at Owasco Outlet; was
          again in Japan 1869-79. Dr. Brown arrived in Japan immediately
          after the opening of the country; during the difficult
          transition period which followed he labored with rare judgment
          and unfailing zeal for both natives and foreign residents. His
          views and his methods were free from narrowness and he
          considered the advancement of civilization a part of the work of
          the Christian missionary. He wrote many articles and newspaper
          letters on Chinese and Japanese subjects; prepared school books
          for his pupils; published Colloquial Japanese (Shanghai, 1863),
          and Prendergast's Mastery System Adapted to the Study of
          Japanese or English (Yokohama, 1878); and assisted in the
          Japanese translation of the New Testament, completed just before
          his death and published the same year.

          after 1660; d. Aug. 25, 1735. He studied at Trinity College,
          Dublin; was consecrated bishop of Cork and Ross 1710. He opposed
          the custom of drinking healths in a series of pamphlets (1713
          sqq.) which won him much notoriety, but has more enduring fame
          as an antideistical writer; in reply to John Toland he published
          A Letter in Answer to a Book Entitled Christianity not
          Mysterious (Dublin, 1697), and afterward elaborated his argument
          in The Procedure, Extent, and Limits of Human Understanding
          (London; 1728), a critique of Locke's Essay; in Things Divine
          and Supernatural Conceived by Analogy with Things Natural and
          Human (1733) he asserts that knowledge of God's essence and
          attributes can be only "analogical" and not direct.

   Browne, Robert
          BROWNE, ROBERT: Leader of the English Separatists (from whom
          they received their popular name of Brownists), and generally
          considered the founder of the Congregationalists; b. at
          Tolethorp (3 m. n. of Stamford), Rutlandshire, about 1550; d at
          Northampton after June 2, 1631. He was of good family and had
          influential relatives on both his father's and his mother's
          side, including the great chancellor, Lord Burghley. He studied
          at Corpus Christi College, Cambridge (B.A., 1572). It is said
          that in 1571 he was domestic chaplain to Thomas Howard, duke of
          Norfolk, and that the duke took his part in some obscure trouble
          with the ecclesiastical authorities; but this is doubtful. He
          taught school for three years (seventeenth century writers say
          in or near London) and made "enemies" by freely speaking his
          mind concerning "many things amiss, and the cause of all to be
          the woeful and lamentable state of the Church." In 1578 or 1579
          he returned to Cambridge. At this time his views seem to have
          ripened. Holding that the true Church consisted only of such as
          led Christian lives and did not properly include all baptized
          persons, he declared that "the kingdom of God was not to be
          begun by whole parishes, but rather of the worthiest, were they
          never so few." He publicly harangued against "the calling and
          authorizing of preachers by bishops," preached constantly to
          Puritan audiences (acceptably, it would appear) although he had
          no bishop's license, and, when his brother obtained a license
          for him, disdained it. Naturally he was silenced, and illness
          compelled him temporarily to comply with the bishop's mandate.

          About 1580 Browne went to Norwich, attracted thither by a
          friend, [559]Robert (or Richard) Harrison, who became his
          coworker. Here he organized his first church and soon extended
          the field of his operations as far as Bury St. Edmunds. The
          bishop of Norwich complained of him as a preacher of "corrupt
          and contentious doctrine" and likely to mislead "the vulgar sort
          of people," but Burghley protected him. Nevertheless Norwich was
          made so uncomfortable for the little band that about Jan., 1582,
          most of them, with their pastor, emigrated to Middelburg in
          Zealand. Browne's impulsive and imperious character, as well as
          the principles of the congregation, did not promote unity. After
          two years of continual discussion and division, with four or
          five families, he left for Scotland. They arrived in Edinburgh
          Jan., 1584, and at once commenced the propagation of their
          peculiar doctrines. They "held opinion of separation from all
          kirks where excommunication was not rigorously used against open
          offenders not repenting; they would not admit witnesses
          [sponsors] in baptism, and sundry other opinions they had."
          Within a week Browne was summoned before the session of the
          kirk; he was imprisoned, but only for a short time; and soon,
          unhindered, if not covertly encouraged by the secular
          authorities, he traveled over Scotland. He returned to England,
          and, possibly, again visited Holland.

          It has generally been supposed that Browne kept on as zealously
          and offensively as ever so far as his strength--which was
          beginning to break owing to imprisonments and
          hardships--permitted, continually harassed by the authorities
          and favored by Burghley, until 1586; that in that year the
          bishop of Peterborough excommunicated him, and this so wrought
          upon him that he changed completely, submitted to the Church,
          and thenceforth lived quietly, and, after a few years, in the
          enjoyment of a good benefice. Mr. Burrage transfers the
          excommunication to a later period and gives the date of Browne's
          submission Oct. 7, 1585. In Nov., 1586, he was elected master of
          St. Olave's Grammar-school in Southwark, binding himself to
          abstain from propagating his peculiar doctrines and to live as a
          member of the Church. His controversial powers were now employed
          against his former associates, Henry Barrow and John Greenwood.
          In Sept., 1591, he received the living of Achurch-cum-Thorpe,
          Northamptonshire; he was ordained deacon and priest on Sept. 30,
          and he remained at Achurch for forty uneventful years. For a
          period of ten years (1816-26) the entries in the parish register
          are not in his handwriting. Mr. Burrage thinks that this was the
          time when he was under sentence of excommunication by the bishop
          of Peterborough, and that the cause was a manifestation of
          Separatist tendencies encouraged by Browne in his parish. If
          this be so he made submission a second time, for his handwriting
          reappears in the register. His last entry is dated June 2, 1631,
          and in Nov., 1633, a new rector took his place. He died in
          Northampton jail, committed for striking a constable who came to
          him to collect a debt, and having shown something of his early
          fervid manner when brought before a justice in consequence.

          Browne's biographers have been much puzzled to explain or
          extenuate his extraordinary conduct in making terms with the
          Church. It has been urged that he was broken physically and
          mentally in 1586; but he can not have been forty years old at
          that time and he lived forty-five years afterward. Dr. Dexter's
          suggestion that he was naturally of unsound mind with a tendency
          to insanity which at times became acute has found wide
          acceptance. It would explain not only Browne's own conduct but
          also the long forbearance and continued kindness which he
          enjoyed from Burghley and others. Mr. Burrage thinks that "at
          last he had become wearied of the continual criticism to which
          his views in the past had subjected him, and probably had
          honestly come to feel that he might be of really more service to
          the world, as it was, not by wearing himself out by combating
          established ideas, but rather by accepting what the world
          offered him and by using the advantage he had thus gained to the
          furtherance of his higher ideals."

          The starting-point of Browne's views and system seems to have
          been his conviction that the spiritual welfare of true
          Christians required their separation from others who were
          Christians in name only. It was futile to hope that such
          separation would be brought about by the bishops and clergy of
          the Established Church or by the civil rulers. Yet the necessity
          for it was immediate. Hence the only course possible was for the
          faithful to secede and organize themselves. A voluntary
          association or covenant of true believers constituted a church,
          and each church had the exclusive right of discipline and the
          choice of its own officers. Two kinds of officers are designated
          in the New Testament: apostles, prophets, evangelists are
          temporary and belong to the past; the abiding officers are the
          pastor, teacher, elders, deacons, and widows who have their
          charge in one church only. The presence of these officers does
          not release any member from the duty of watching and helping the
          others, and a similar responsibility exists between churches.
          The civil authorities should have nothing to do with spiritual
          matters, and it is not their province to enforce conformity to
          any ecclesiastical system. He was thus the first Englishman to
          express the Anabaptist doctrine of complete separation of Church
          and State. See [560]Congregationalists, I., 1, §§ 1-2.

          Browne published three treatises at Middelburg (1582), entitled
          respectively: (1) A Book which Sheweth the Life and Manners of
          All True Christians, and how unlike they are unto Turks and
          Papists and heathen folk; also the points and parts of all
          divinity that is of the revealed will and word of God are
          declared by their several definitions and divisions in order
          (extracts in Walker, pp. 18-27); (2) A Treatise of Reformation
          without Tarrying for Any, and of the wickedness of those
          preachers which will not reform till the magistrate command or
          compel them (reprinted, Boston, "Old South Leaflet, no. 100 ";
          with biographical introduction by T. G. Crippen, London, 1903);
          (3) A Treatise upon the 23d of Matthew, both for an order of
          studying and handling the Scriptures and also for avoiding the
          popish disorders and ungodly communion of all false Christians,
          especially of wicked preachers and hirelings (extracts in
          Burrage, pp. 21-25). These were intended primarily to further
          his cause in England and were spread abroad by his followers;
          two men were hanged in 1583 for disseminating them (see
          [561]Coppin, John). Several other publications or manuscripts of
          Browne's are mentioned (Mr. Burrage, True Story, pp. 74-75,
          enumerates twenty-five) and the following are known to be
          preserved: (4) A True and Short Declaration both of the
          Gathering and Joining together of Certain Persons, and also of
          the lamentable breach and division which fell among them (1584?;
          reprinted in The Congregationalist, London, 1882), the story of
          Browne's early life; (5) An Answer to Master Cartwright's Letter
          for joining with the English Churches (London, n.d.; extracts in
          Burrage, pp. 31-36); (6) A Reproof of Certain Schismatical
          Persons [Henry Barrow and John Greenwood] and their doctrine,
          touching the hearing and preaching of the word of God
          (manuscript written probably in 1588, discovered by Mr. Burrage
          and published by him, Oxford, 1907); (7) A letter addressed "My
          good Uncle," and dated "the last of December, 1588" [Jan. 10,
          1589], discovered and published with introduction by Champlin
          Burrage under the title A New Years Guift (London, 1904). The
          letter is quoted by Richard Bancroft, afterward archbishop of
          Canterbury, in a sermon at Paul's Cross, Feb. 9, 1588, and the
          manuscript discovered by Mr. Burrage is indorsed in what is
          believed to be Brancroft's handwriting "Mr. Browne's Answer to
          Mr. Flower's Letter." One sheet (4 pages) is lacking, but the
          part preserved contains more than 6,000 words, discusses the
          subject of church government at considerable length, and is
          particularly interesting for the idea which it gives of Browne's
          views concerning the Church of England at the time of writing;
          (8) A letter to Burghley, Apr. 15, 1590, printed by Strype in
          the Life and Acts of John Whitgift, appendix, bk. iii., no. xlv.

   Browne, Sir Thomas
          BROWNE, SIR THOMAS: Author of the Religio Medici; b. in
          Cheapside, London, Oct. 19, 1605; d. at Norwich Oct. 19, 1682.
          He attended Winchester College and Broadgate Hall (Pembroke
          College), Oxford (B.A., 1626; M.A., 1629); studied medicine and
          practised in Oxfordshire; traveled in Ireland, France, and
          Italy, continued his medical studies at Montpellier and Padua,
          and received his degree of doctor of medicine at Leyden about
          1633; settled at Norwich in 1637, where he gained much repute as
          a physician and still more as a man of universal knowledge. The
          Religio Medici was probably written about 1635 and not intended
          for publication; two unauthorized editions appeared in 1642,
          which led to an edition with the author's approval, but
          anonymous, in 1643. The work is peculiar from its blending of
          deep religious feeling and skeptical views. "It appears to have
          been composed as a tour de force of intellectual agility, an
          attempt to combine daring skepticism with implicit faith in
          revelation." The style is metaphorical and artificial, with many
          Latinized words, but striking and impressive. Browne also
          published: Pseudodoxia Epidemica, or Enquiries into very Many
          Received Tenets and commonly Presumed Truths, which Examined
          prove but Vulgar and Common Errors (London, 1646); Hydriotaphia
          or Urnburial and The Garden of Cyrus (1658); many of his
          manuscripts were published posthumously. The best edition of his
          complete works is by Simon Wilkin (4 vols., London, 1835-36;
          reprinted, abridged, by Bohn, 3 vols., 1851-52). The Religio
          Medici, with A Letter to a Friend upon Occasion of the Death of
          his Intimate Friend (first published 1690) and Christian Morals
          (1716), and the Hydriotaphia and Garden of Cyrus, have been
          carefully edited by W. A. Greenhill (London, 1881 and 1896); and
          the Religio Medici is ed. with introduction by C. H. Herford
          (New York, 1907).

   Brownlee, William Craig
          BROWNLEE, WILLIAM CRAIG: American (Dutch) Reformed clergyman; b.
          at Torfoot, Lanarkshire, Scotland, 1783; d. in New York Feb. 10,
          1860. He was graduated at Glasgow University; was licensed and
          emigrated to America in 1808; was pastor at Mt. Pleasant,
          Washington County, Penn., Philadelphia (1813), and Baskingridge,
          N. J. (1819); professor of languages in Rutgers College 1825;
          called to the Collegiate Reformed Dutch Church, New York, 1826;
          made pastor emeritus after a paralytic stroke in 1843. He was a
          strong opponent of Roman Catholics and Quakers. He published
          Inquiry into the Principles of Quakers (New York, 1824); The
          Roman Catholic Controversy (Philadelphia, 1834); Lights and
          Shadows of Christian Life (New York, 1837); Popery an Enemy to
          Civil and Religious Liberty (1836); Romanism in the Light of
          Prophecy and History (1857).

          Bibliography: A Memorial was published by the consistory of his
          Church (New York, 1860).

   Brownson, Orestes Augustus
          BROWNSON, ORESTES AUGUSTUS: Roman Catholic convert; b. at
          Stockbridge, Vt., Sept. 16, 1803; d. at Detroit, Mich., Apr. 17,
          1876. His religious career is marked by its many changes. The
          influences of his boyhood were of the strictest New England
          orthodoxy; at nineteen he joined a Presbyterian church at
          Ballston, N. Y.; in 1826 he was ordained (at Jaffrey, N. H.) a
          Universalist minister; after two or three years he left the
          Universalists, and, influenced by Robert Dale Owen and his
          projects, became a socialist, entered politics, and helped form
          a "Workingmen's Party" in New York. He soon despaired of reform
          by means of political organization, and in 1831 again began
          preaching at Ithaca, N. Y., this time as an independent,
          attracted by the writings of William Ellery Channing. Later he
          had Unitarian parishes at Walpole, N. H., and Canton, Mass. In
          1836 he organized in Boston "The Society for Christian Union and
          Progress" and continued its minister till 1843, when he gave up
          preaching. In Oct., 1844, he was received into the Roman
          Catholic Church in Boston, and did not again change his faith,
          although he continued independent and combative within the
          Church and received a recommendation from Rome to be more
          guarded in his language. He wrote with great zeal and no small
          ability in advocacy of all of his successive beliefs. He started
          The Boston Quarterly Review in 1838 and wrote nearly all its
          numbers till it was merged in The Democratic Review of New York
          in 1843; from 1844 to 1864 and again 1873-75 he published
          Brownson's Quarterly Review, at first in Boston, later in New
          York, where he lived 1855-75. His books were: New Views of
          Christianity, Society, and the Church (Boston, 1836); Charles
          Elwood, or the Infidel Converted (1840); Essays and Reviews (New
          York, 1852); The Spirit Rapper; an Autobiography (Boston, 1854);
          The Convert, or Leaves from my Experience (New York, 1857); The
          American Republic, its Constitution, Tendencies, and Destiny
          (1865).

   Bruce, Alexander Balmain
          BRUCE, ALEXANDER BALMAIN: Church of Scotland; b. at Aberargie (a
          hamlet in the parish of Abernethy, 7 m. s.e. of Perth),
          Perthshire, Jan. 30, 1831; d. at Glasgow Aug. 7, 1899. He was
          educated at the University of Edinburgh (1845-49) and the
          Divinity Hall of the Free Church of Scotland, which he entered
          in 1849. After the completion of his theological studies, he was
          an assistant minister at Ancrum, Roxburghshire, and Lochwinnoch,
          Renfrewshire, until 1859, when he accepted a call to the
          pastorate of Cardross, Dumbartonshire, where he remained nine
          years. He was then minister of the East Free Church, Broughty
          Ferry, Forfarshire, from 1868 to 1875, and in the latter year
          was appointed professor of apologetics and New Testament
          exegesis in the Free Church Hall, Glasgow, a position which he
          held until his death. In theology he declared himself to be "in
          sympathy with modern religious thought, while maintaining
          solidarity with all that is best in the theology of the past; in
          favor of freedom in critical inquiries on the basis of evangelic
          faith, and of a simplified and more comprehensive creed." The
          boldness of his views brought him to the notice of the General
          Assembly of his denomination in 1890, but after consideration
          his writings were pronounced to be, on the whole, in accord with
          orthodox standards. He was Cunningham Lecturer in 1874, Ely
          Lecturer in Union Theological Seminary, New Work, in 1886, and
          Gifford Lecturer in Glasgow University in 1896-97, and after
          1894 collaborated with T. K. Cheyne in editing the Theological
          Translation Library. In addition to minor contributions, he
          wrote The Training of the Twelve (Edinburgh, 1871); The
          Humiliation of Christ (1876); The Chief End of Revelation
          (London, 1881); The Parabolic Teaching of Christ (1882); The
          Galilæan Gospel (Edinburgh, 1884); F. C. Baur and his Theory of
          the Origin of Christianity and of the New Testament (London,
          1885); The Miraculous Element in the Gospels (the Ely lectures
          for 1886; 1886); The Life of William Denny (1888); The Kingdom
          of God, or, Christ's Teachings according to the Synoptic Gospels
          (Edinburgh, 1889); Apologetics: or, The Cause of Christianity

   Bruch, Johann Friedrich
          BRUCH, brUh, JOHANN FRIEDRICH: German theologian; b. at
          Pirmasens (13 m. e.s.e. of Zweibrücken), Rhenish Bavaria, Dec.
          13, 1792; d. at Strasburg July 21, 1874. He was educated at the
          gymnasium of Zweibrücken and the Protestant academy of
          Strasburg, after which he was successively tutor at Cologne
          (1812), vicar at Lohr in German Lotharingia, and private tutor
          in Paris (1815). In Nov., 1821, he was appointed professor at
          the Protestant seminary at Strasburg, and a few months later
          became full professor in the theological faculty. His position,
          both then and later, was rationalistic. His conception of
          revelation, miracles, Christ and his works, sin, and salvation,
          therefore, frequently diverged widely from the teachings of the
          Church and of tradition. His lectures were at first restricted
          to Christian ethics and the synoptic Gospels, but later embraced
          also systematic theology and the New Testament, in addition to
          practical homiletics. After 1831 he was preacher at the
          Nicholaikirche, where he sought to instruct and calm the
          religious excitement caused by the attacks of orthodox Pietism
          on liberal theology, aiming to further a faith based on reason
          and a life of true Christianity, as well as unity and peace
          within the Church.

          Bruch's influence was also felt in the development of the
          religious life of his city, and in the foundation and
          administration of religious and ecclesiastical projects. The
          first infant schools, the evening schools for poor children,
          Sunday lectures for workingmen, the society for the improvement
          of young criminals, and the society for the evangelization of
          Protestants scattered in the departments of the East were among
          those inspired and called into existence by him. He was also the
          president of the Strasburg Bible Society and until his death
          conducted the pastoral conference of his city. After 1828 he
          likewise acted as the director of the Protestant gymnasium. In
          1849 he was appointed inspector of the district of St. Thomas,
          in 1852 a member of the supreme consistory, and in 1866 of the
          directory. Amid all these tasks he found time and strength to
          treat the most obscure problems of theology and philosophy,
          although he was obliged, for lack of sympathy, to abandon his
          plea of writing in French to supply the deficiency of Protestant
          theological literature in France. The Franco-Prussian War
          brought devastation into Church and school, and Bruch was
          accordingly appointed rector of the new university and placed in
          control of the provisional direction of ecclesiastical affairs,
          the final efforts of his life being devoted to a reorganization
          of the theological faculty and of the ecclesiastical situation,
          which he sought to protect against the domination of the system
          prevailing at Berlin.

          Bruch was a prolific writer, his works, in addition to numerous
          pamphlets and articles in learned periodicals, being as follows:
          Lehrbuch der christlichen Sittenlehre (2 vols., Strasburg,
          1829-32); Christliche Vorträge (2 vols., 1838-42); Études
          philosophiques sur le christianisme (Paris, 1839); Ideen zur
          Abfassung einer den Bedürfnissen der deutsch-protestantischen
          Kirche Frankreichs entsprechenden Liturgie (Strasburg, 1839);
          Die Lehre von den göttlichen Eigenschaften (Hamburg, 1842);
          Zustände der protestantischen Kirche Frankreichs (1843);
          Betrachtungen über Christenthum und christlichen Glauben in
          Briefen (2 vols., Strasburg, 1845-46); Weisheitslehre der
          Hebräer, ein Beitrag zur Geschichte der Philosophie (1851); Das

          menschlichen Seele (1859); and Theorie des Bewusstseins (1864).

          BRUECK, brük (PONTANUS, real name HEINSE, HENISCH, HEINCZ),
          GREGORIUS: German jurist; b. at Brück (22 m. n. of Wittenberg)
          c. 1484; d. at Jena Feb. 15, 1557. He studied at Wittenberg and
          Frankfort-on-the Oder, and became so famous as the secretary and
          representative of the jurist Hennig Göde that princes and
          critics sought his advice. Frederick the Wise invited him to his
          court, and after the death of the electoral councilor Degenhard
          Pfeffinger (1519), Brück seems to have taken his place. He was
          soon interested in Luther, and it was not without significance
          that he accompanied the elector to Cologne and Worms. Having
          returned to Wittenberg, Brück received the degree of doctor of
          law, and soon afterward was appointed chancellor. His tact and
          ability greatly helped the cause of the Reformation, and the
          development of the Evangelical Church. He was instrumental in
          bringing about the Torgau-Magdeburg confederations; he advised
          the elector at the diets held at Speyer in 1526 and 1529, and it
          was due to him, next to Luther, that the Pack-disturbances did
          not lead to a general war. But his greatest services were
          rendered at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530. He not only gave the
          first impulse to the composition of the Augsburg Confession, but
          he took part in the preparation of its details, wrote the
          introduction to it, caused it to be read in public, and gave to
          the emperor the Latin copy in the name of the Evangelical
          estates. He would not be intimidated, but, on the contrary,
          encouraged the timid, and acted as spokesman in all public
          debates, so that his eloquence and ability were even recognized
          by his opponents. Cochlæus, well aware of the importance of
          Brück, vainly tried to induce him to abandon the Lutherans by an
          "Admonition to Peace and Unity." Brück's reply is unknown, for
          at the time he was engaged in writing a true account of events
          at the Diet of Augsburg, 1530, which was first printed in
          Förstemann's Archiv für die Geschichte der kirchlichen
          Reformation (Halle, 1831). Brück attended all diets held during
          his lifetime, and he also strove for the consolidation of the
          Church, finally succeeding in 1542 in forming a permanent
          consistory. For a time he resided at Wittenberg, but after the
          disastrous end of the Schmalkald War, which he had consistently
          opposed, he followed the sons of the Elector to Weimar,
          remaining a loyal friend of the imprisoned Frederick. Still
          later Brück retired to Jena, where he died.

          BRUECKNER, brük´ner, BENNO BRUNO: German Protestant; b. at
          Rosswein (23 m. w. of Dresden) May 9, 1824. He was educated at
          the University of Leipsic, and after serving as pastor at
          Hohburg from 1850 to 1853 was appointed associate professor and
          second university preacher at Leipsic. Two years later he was
          made full professor, and in the following year was appointed
          university preacher and director of the seminary for practical
          theology. He became canon of Meissen and consistorial councilor
          in 1860, and nine years later went to Berlin as provost of St.
          Nicholas and St. Mary, honorary professor, university preacher,
          and member of the high consistory, of which he became clerical
          vice-president in 1877. In 1872 he was chosen general
          superintendent of Berlin, and in the following year was
          appointed canon of Brandenburg. He became high consistorial
          councilor in 1880, a member of the Prussian council of state in
          1884, and president of the united synods of the district of
          Berlin in 1889. His works include Epistola ad Philippenses Paulo
          auctori vindicata contra Baurium (Leipsic, 1848); Betrachtungen
          über die Agende der evangelisch-lutherischen Kirche in Sachsen
          (1865); and numerous sermons, both individual and collected,
          many of which ran through several editions. He also edited the
          second and third editions of W. M. L. De Wette's commentary on
          the Catholic Epistles (Leipsic, 1853-67) and the fifth edition
          of his commentary on the Gospel of John (1863).

   Brugmann, Jan
          BRUGMANN, brug´m??n, JAN: A theologian and reformer of the
          Franciscan order in the Netherlands and Germany. The date of his
          birth is unknown, but from the way in which he speaks of his age
          in 1473, the year of his death, he was probably born about 1400,
          at Kempen. He was educated and admitted to the clerical state in
          a monastery of the northwestern Netherlands, perhaps Groningen.
          He joined the Franciscans at Saint-Omer in Artois, where the
          community was full of the spirit of St. Bernardin of Sienna, the
          founder of the strict or Observant Franciscans. Here he taught
          theology, until in 1439 he was charged, at the request of the
          town council of Gouda, with the erection of an Observantine
          house there, and later took part in a similar work at Stuis,
          Leyden, and Alkmaar. Learning to know the moral and spiritual
          condition of the people while discharging these missions, he set
          himself to elevate it by popular preaching, at the same time
          effecting a reform in the convents of Gronigen, Gorinchem,
          Haarlem, Warnsveld, and Nymwegen between 1450 and 1455. At
          Amsterdam he founded a house in 1462, and composed a bitter
          factional strife among the citizens. He brought about the
          foundation of the Observantine province of Cologne, of which he
          was provincial for several years. Feeling his end approaching,
          he retired to Nymwegen, where he died. His influence went far
          beyond the reform of the Franciscan houses; he ranks with the
          great popular preachers of the Netherlands at that time, such as
          Groote and Florentius Radewyns, with whom he was in close
          alliance. A few of his sermons have been printed (see below). He
          wrote also a life of Christ, which in some particulars resembles
          those of Bonaventura and Ludolf of Saxony, though adhering more
          closely to the Gospel narrative. In spite of its frequently
          erroneous exegesis and its arbitrary mystical interpretations,
          it is so full of simple piety and warm devotion that it awakens
          respect. He wrote also, in three different versions, the life of
          Lidwina of Schiedam, a mystical ascetic considered a saint in
          the Netherlands (1350-1443); it has recently been discovered
          that he was a vernacular spiritual poet of no slight importance.

          stake at Tournai (14 m. e. of Lille), Flanders, Feb. 19, 1545.
          Educated for the Church, he became lector in the Dominican
          convent at Metz and was expelled in 1540 or 1541 for
          sympathizing with the Reformation. In July, 1541, he was in
          Strasburg and intimate with Calvin, in whose house he lived, and
          when Calvin was recalled to Geneva (1541) succeeded him in the
          pastorate. In September, 1544, he undertook a missionary journey
          to Flanders on the invitation of persons in Tournai who wished
          instruction in the Reformed faith; preached there and in
          neighboring cities with earnestness and success, but necessarily
          in secret, as to preach Protestant doctrine was forbidden. He
          was arrested at Tournai in November, condemned, and executed,
          notwithstanding efforts made to save him from Strasburg and by
          the Protestant princes of Germany.

          BRUNETIÈRE, brü´´ne-tyar´, MARIE FERDINAND: French Roman
          Catholic critic; b. at Toulon (42 m. e.s.e. of Marseilles) July
          19, 1849; d. in Paris Dec. 9, 1906. Educated at Marseilles and
          at the Lycée Louis le Grand, Paris, he became secretary of the
          editorial board of the Revue des deux mondes in 1875 and editor
          in 1893. He was appointed professor of the French language and
          literature at the École Normale Supérieure, Paris, and in 1893
          became a lecturer at the Sorbonne. He delivered a course of
          lectures in the United States in 1897. In 1887 he was made a
          chevalier of the Legion of Honor, and in 1893 was admitted to
          the French Academy, while in 1895 he was appointed a commander
          of the Order of Pius IX. His theological attitude was noteworthy
          in that, like Coppée, Huysmans, and other distinguished literary
          men of France, he became convinced of the truth of the teachings
          of the Roman Catholic Church, abandoning the agnosticism which
          be had formerly professed. His writings, which mark a new epoch
          in French criticism, include Études critiques sur l'histoire de
          la littérature française (7 vols., Paris, 1880-1903); Histoire
          et littérature (3 vols., 1884-86); Questions de critique (2

   Brunfels, Otto
          BRUNFELS, OTTO: German humanist and Reformer. The date of his
          birth can not be determined; d. at Bern Nov. 23, 1534. His
          father was an artisan at Mainz. At an early age he entered the
          Carthusian order, but the spirit of the age soon drew him out of
          his convent into the polemics of the time. At first he was a
          follower of Hutten, for whom he broke a lance with Erasmus, and
          whose library he used in compiling a small collection of the
          writings of Huss, which he published in 1524, with a dedication
          to Luther. He served the Reformation as a preacher, first at
          Steinheim, and then at Neuenburg in the Breisgau. When the
          attitude of the imperial government made his position there
          insecure, he went to Strasburg, where he supported himself by
          teaching, wrote against tithes, and studied medicine. He was a
          friend of Luther and also of Carlstadt, but was still more
          strongly attracted by Zwingli, whose influence procured him a
          medical position at Bern. His importance lies chiefly in the
          fact that he was a successful botanist, and a pioneer in this
          science for Germany, with his extensive illustrated Herbarium
          (Strasburg, 3 vols., 1530-40, translated into German, 2 parts,
          1532-37, 2d ed., 1546).

          m. n.w. of Carlsruhe) Dec. 20, 1558. In 1527 he was called from
          Strasburg, where he was a deacon, to Worms, as pastor of the
          congregation. By his discretion he soon restored harmony in the
          community, which had been endangered for a time by the
          activities of the Anabaptists Denk, Hetzer, and Kantz. In 1531
          he published his Christliche Betrachtung, wie man sich bei den
          Kranken und Sterbenden halten soll; and in 1543 he prepared a
          Catechismus und Anweisung zum christlichen Glauben, of which the
          few fragments still extant show his catechetical ability. In the
          doctrine on the Lord's Supper he followed the Strasburg
          theologians. Through the Interim he was obliged in 1548 to
          resign his office at Worms and fled to Strasburg, where he soon
          became assistant pastor. With the other Strasburg ministers he
          adopted the Lutheran teaching, and remained faithful to it in
          Landau, whither he was called in 1553 by the Treaty of Passau.
          Here he contributed much toward the amelioration of the moral
          and religious life of the people. Besides the works already
          mentioned, he published Concordantz des Neuen Testaments
          (Strasburg, 1524) and Concordantz und Zeiger aller biblischen
          Bücher (1530).

   Bruno of Cologne
          BRUNO OF COLOGNE: Archbishop of Cologne 953-965; b. in the
          spring of 925, the youngest son of Henry I., the Fowler; d. at
          Reims Oct. 11, 965. He was educated from his fourth to his
          fourteenth year in the cathedral school of Utrecht. His brother
          Otto I. recalled him in 939 to the court. As early as 940 he was
          invested with the functions of chancellor, and ordained deacon a
          year or two later. In 951 he was made archicapellanus and thus
          exercised a great influence on the administration of the whole
          kingdom. In 947 he took part in the Synod of Verdun, where
          German ecclesiastics settled the question of the archbishopric
          of Reims, important to the later history of France. In 951 he
          went with Otto to Italy, and supported his brother faithfully in
          the disturbances of the next year. Otto had him chosen
          archbishop of Cologne in 953, and added to his spiritual
          sovereignty the government of Lorraine. He was consecrated Sept.
          25. Lorraine was a very troublesome possession; it was not until
          after the banishment of Count Raginar of Hainault in 958 that he
          succeeded in establishing peace and order there. The relations
          with France often offered difficult problems, too. After the
          death of King Louis d'Outremer and Duke Hugh the Great, Bruno
          was made a sort of supreme judicial arbiter for France in his
          brother's name. Peace was his constant aim, together with the
          assertion of Carolingian sovereignty. On Otto's second absence
          in Italy (961), the administration of the empire was confided to
          Bruno and William of Mainz. Bruno's importance is mainly
          political, as a representative of the close alliance of the
          episcopate and the crown which marked Otto's policy. As a
          bishop, however, he did much to promote a real and living piety
          and to encourage education.

   Bruno, (Filippo) Giordano
          BRUNO, (FILIPPO) GIORDANO: Italian philosopher of the
          Renaissance; b. at Nola (14 m. e.n.e. of Naples), Campania,
          1548; burned at the stake at Rome Feb. 17, 1600. He joined the
          Dominicans at Naples at the age of fourteen or fifteen, but
          study and reflection and particularly the influence of the works
          of Nicholas of Cusa and Raymond Lully made him doubtful of dogma
          and restive under the strict rules of his order. In 1576 he fled
          to Rome and thenceforth led a wandering life. He first visited
          various cities of North Italy; about 1580 he reached Geneva,
          stayed there two years, and went on to Paris through Lyons and
          Toulouse; at Paris he gave lectures on philosophy; from 1583 to
          1585 he was in England, where he had the friendship of such men
          as Sir Philip Sidney, and composed his most important works;
          between 1586 and 1588 he was lecturing at Wittenberg; he visited
          Prague, Helmstädt, Frankfort, Zurich, and Padua, and reached
          Venice early in 1592. Here he was arrested in May, tried before
          the Inquisition, and his case adjourned to Rome, Jan., 1593. On
          Jan. 7, 1600, after a confinement of seven years, he was
          condemned as an apostate and heretic and given over to the civil
          authorities for execution. He was the first philosopher to
          espouse the Copernican hypothesis; in his metaphysical
          interpretation of it he radically opposed the philosophy and
          science of his time, and subverted also the most cherished
          teachings of the Church. His fundamental principle, as against
          Aristotle, was the absolute boundlessness of the universe. The
          supernatural in its traditional sense was thus eliminated. No
          heaven existed separate from the universe. The world--the
          phenomenal aspect of the universe--and God are not the same, but
          God is identified with the universe; or God may be designated as
          matter conceived of in extended substance, essentially
          immaterial, the immanent cause or soul of the world. Later
          philosophers, Descartes, Spinoza, Leibnitz, Boehme, and Hegel
          owe much to Bruno. Just three hundred years after his execution,
          Feb. 17, 1900, on the very spot where he was burned, a monument
          was dedicated to his memory.

          Bruno's most important works were the Spaccio della bestia
          trionfante (Paris, 1584); Della causa, principio ed uno, and Del
          infinito universo e mondi (Venice, 1584); De triplici minimo et
          mensura, and De monade numero et figura (Frankfort, 1591). His
          Italian works were edited by Wagner (2 vols., Leipsic, 1830) and
          by Paul de Lagarde (2 vols., Göttingen, 1888); his Latin works
          by Fiorentino (2 vols., Naples, 1879-91) and by Tocco (Florence,
          1889). The Della causa has been translated into German by Lasson
          (3d ed., Leipsic, 1902), and a German translation of his
          collected philosophical works begun by L. Kuhlenbeck (Jena,
          1904, vol. v., 1907), who has also edited Lichtstrahlen aus
          Giordano Bruno's Werken (Leipsic, 1891). There is an English
          translation of "The Expulsion of the Triumphant Beast" by W.
          Morehead (London, 1713; only 50 copies printed and now extremely
          rare), and of the "Heroic Enthusiasts" (Gli eroici furori,
          Paris, 1558) by L. Williams (London, 1887); a general account
          and synopsis of the "Infinite Universe," written by Bruno in his
          dedication of the work to Lord Castelnau, was translated by John
          Toland and printed, with a Latin essay on the death of Bruno (in
          A Collection of Several Pieces of Mr. John Toland, vol. i.,
          London, 1726, pp. 304-349).

   Bruno (Bonifatius) of Querfurt
          BRUNO (BONIFATIUS) OF QUERFURT: Missionary to the Slavs and
          Prussians, among whom he suffered martyrdom, Feb. 14, or Mar.
          16. 1009. He was a Saxon nobleman, educated at the
          cathedral-school at Magdeburg, and accompanied his cousin, the
          Emperor Otto III., to Rome (996), where he took holy orders.
          Pope Sylvester II. entrusted to him a missionary expedition to
          the Slavs in the east, which the Polish duke Boleslav had asked
          for, and he was raised to the rank of archbishop. His chief task
          was to be the conversion of the heathen Prussians, to whom
          [564]Adalbert of Prague had fallen victim but a short time
          before. Being detained at Magdeburg by wars between Germans and
          Poles, he wrote the Vita S. Alberti. Peace being reestablished,
          he went to Poland and was gladly received by Boleslav, but being
          unable to enter into Prussia, he converted the Petchenegs and
          organized their church affairs. Remaining for some time in
          Poland, he wrote the Vita quinque fratrum Poloniæ, Christian
          martyrs slain in 1003 near Meseritz, and when at last he took
          upon him the task he was entrusted with, he and his companions,
          like St. Adalbert, lost their lives by the swords of the heathen
          not far from Braunsberg. Boleslav, who was deeply afflicted,
          ordered the remains of the martyrs to be gathered and brought to
          Poland, where they were solemnly buried and became an object of
          most devoted reverence.

   Bruno of Segni
          BRUNO OF SEGNI: Bishop of Segni (28 m. s.e. of Rome); b. at
          Solero (6 m. w. of Alessandria), Lombardy, between 1045 and
          1049; d. at Segni July 18, 1123. He was educated in a monastery
          near his birthplace and at Bologna, became a canon at Sienna,
          and came to Rome in 1079. Here he came in contact with the
          leaders of the Church, and must have soon attracted the
          attention of Gregory VII., if it is true that it was at his
          request that he disputed with Berengar on the Eucharist. In any
          case he accomplished his task so well that the pope made him
          bishop of Segni in the Campagna the same year. He was even more
          closely connected with Urban II., whom be accompanied to France
          in 1095. In 1099 he entered the monastery of Monte Cassino, but
          without resigning his see or severing his relations with the
          outside world. He undertook an important mission to France for
          Paschal II. in 1106, and remained with the pope for some time
          after his return, finally going back to his cloister, where he
          was elected abbot in 1107. Paschal made no objection to this
          pluralism until in the conflicts of 1111 Bruno took the part of
          the antipope Maginulf (Sylvester IV.), and was forced to resign
          his abbacy and return to Segni. Lucius III. canonized him in
          1181. His works (in MPL, clxiv., clxv.) are principally
          exegetical. His Libellus de symoniacis, written before 1109, is
          important for its discussion of the meaning of simony, and
          especially for its attitude on the sacraments of a simoniacal
          priest.

   Bruno of Würtzburg
          BRUNO OF WÜRZBURG: Bishop of Würzburg 1034-45. He was the son of
          Duke Conrad I. of Carinthia, and thus a nephew of Pope Gregory
          V. and a cousin of the emperor Conrad II. The latter made him
          bishop of Würzburg in 1034. In the spring of 1045 he accompanied
          Henry III. to Hungary, and died May 26 from the results of
          injuries received in the fall of a building at Persenbeug in
          what is now Upper Austria. As a theologian he is remembered for
          his commentary on the Psalms, made up mainly of extracts from
          older authors, especially Cassiodorus, but including Augustine,
          Gregory the Great, the pseudo-Bede, and the Breviarium in
          Psalmos ascribed to Jerome. A catechetical exposition of the
          Lord's Prayer and the Apostles' and Athanasian Creeds attributed
          to him is probably older.

   Brunswick
          BRUNSWICK: A North German duchy, consisting of three larger
          territories and six small exclaves, bounded on the north by
          Hanover, on the east by Saxony, on the south by Hanover, and on
          the west by Westphalia; area, 1,424 square miles; population
          (1900), 464,333, of whom 432,570 (93.1%) are Lutherans; 4,406
          (.9%) Reformed; 24,175 (5.2%) Roman Catholics; 1,358 of various
          sects; and 1,824 (.39%) Jews. The Lutheran Church was
          established in the duchy in 1568, but received its first
          official organization in 1657 and 1709, while in 1755 and 1764
          the administration was placed under six general
          superintendencies, which are now located at Wolfenbüttel,
          Brunswick, Helmstädt, Blankenburg, Gandersheim, and Holzminden.
          The act of Oct. 12, 1832, emphasized the ecclesiastical power of
          the duke, which is enforced with the cooperation and counsel of
          an evangelical consistory composed of both clergy and laity. At
          the same time the appointment of church-directors for the
          administration of individual churches was considered, but these
          officials were not actually created until Nov. 20, 1851. Where
          the congregation has the right of electing its pastors, these
          "church-deputies," together with an equal number of
          representatives elected by the community, choose the ministers,
          and in other cases extend the invitation to the candidates
          proposed by the duke or by patrons. The congregations, however,
          have the right to reject candidates who are deficient either in
          morality or in ability. The number of deputies has increased
          with the population from four to sixteen, and they are chosen by
          secret ballot, serving for a term of six years.

          About twenty years after the organization of the parishes, a
          general synod was created (May 31, 1871), consisting of twelve
          clergymen and sixteen laymen from seven electoral districts, in
          addition to two clerical and two lay delegates appointed by the
          duke. This synod, which holds its sessions in public, controls
          all modification, interpretation, and promulgation of laws for
          the churches, except in matters of doctrine. The committee of
          the synod is composed of two clerical and two lay members with a
          fifth chosen from one of the two main bodies, and is required to
          decide, together with the consistory, on the rejection of
          candidates by individual congregations, and to discipline
          pastors and teachers of religion.

          Shortly after the creation of this synod, inspectoral synods
          were introduced by a law of Jan. 6, 1873, which enacted that
          each parish should be inspected every two years, and that this
          must take place annually for the city of Brunswick in one of the
          local churches. A lay inspector may also be appointed by the
          duke in addition to the regular synod. These regulations control
          twenty-eight superintendencies with 230 parishes and 428
          buildings for religious purposes, of which 333 are churches. A
          seminary for preachers is conducted at Wolfenbüttel by the
          consistory, and numerous institutions and associations exist in
          the duchy. Among the latter special mention may be made of a
          missionary society, a house of deaconesses, the sisterhoods at
          Marienberg near Helmstädt, and, above all, of the "Evangelical
          Association for the Duchy of Brunswick," with its many
          affiliated interests. Few sectaries have found their way into
          Brunswick, although Baptists and Mennonites are found here and
          there, the latter having an establishment for missions in the
          capital itself.

          BRYANT, JACOB: English antiquarian; b. at Plymouth 1715; d. at
          Cypenham, in Farnham Royal (4 m. n. of Windsor), Nov. 14, 1804.
          He studied at King's College, Cambridge (B.A., 1740; M.A.,
          1744), and became fellow; was tutor and in 1756 became secretary
          to the Duke of Marlborough, and enjoyed the patronage of the
          family during his life and had free access to their famous
          library at Blenheim. He was a learned man, but his fondness for
          paradox and other eccentricities render his writings of slight
          permanent value. He published works upon a variety of subjects,
          classical literature and antiquities, the gipsy language, the
          Marlborough collection of gems, etc. Those which have religious
          interest are Observations and Enquiries Relating to Various
          Parts of Ancient History (Cambridge, 1767), in which he defends

   Bryce, George
          BRYCE, GEORGE: American Presbyterian; b. at Mount Pleasant,
          Ont., Apr. 22, 1844. He was educated at the University of
          Toronto and Knox College, Toronto (B.A., 1871), and was examiner
          in natural history in the former institution in 1870-1872. In
          1871 he was chosen by the General Assembly of the Presbyterian
          Church of Canada to organize a church and college in Winnipeg,
          and accordingly established Manitoba College in the same year
          and Knox Church, Winnipeg, in 1872. Five years later he was one
          of the founders of Manitoba University, where he was examiner in
          science and chairman of the faculty of science until 1904. In
          the following year he was appointed to his present position of
          professor of English literature and financial agent in Manitoba
          College. For many years he has been active in Presbyterian home
          missions in Manitoba, and was moderator of the general Assembly
          of the Presbyterian Church in Canada in 1902-03. He has written:
          Manitoba; Infancy, Progress, and Present Condition (London,
          1882); Short History of the Canadian People (1887); The Apostle
          of Red River (Toronto, 1898); Remarkable History of the Hudson's

   Bryennios, Philotheos
          BRYENNIOS, brî-en´´nî´es, PHILOTHEOS, fî´´lo-thê´es: Greek
          metropolitan of Nicomedia; b. at Constantinople March 26 (old
          style), 1833. He was educated at the "Theological School in
          Chalce of the great Church of Christ" (1856), and the
          universities of Leipsic, Berlin, and Munich. In 1861 he became
          professor of ecclesiastical history, exegesis, and other studies
          at Chalce, of which he was appointed master and director in
          1863, although he soon resigned the latter positions. In 1867 he
          was called to Constantinople to be the head of the "Great School
          of the Nation" in the Phanar, or Greek quarter of
          Constantinople, and remained there until in 1875 he was sent by
          the Most Holy Synod of metropolitans and patriarchs to the Old
          Catholic conference at Bonn, where he received the patriarchal
          letter announcing his appointment as metropolitan of Serrae in
          Macedonia. In 1877 he was transferred to the metropolitan see of
          Nicomedia, and three years later went to Bucharest as
          commissioner of the Eastern Orthodox Patriarchal and other
          independent churches, to decide concerning the Greek monasteries
          which had been plundered in Moldavia and Wallachia. In 1882, at
          the instance of the Holy Synod of Metropolitans in
          Constantinople, and the patriarch Joachim Ill., he wrote a reply
          to the encyclical letter of Pope Leo XIII. concerning the Slavic
          apostles Cyrillus and Methodius, which was published at
          Constantinople in 1882 with the approbation and at the expense
          of the Holy Synod. His fame rests upon his discovery in 1873 in
          the Jerusalem Monastery of the Most Holy Sepulcher in the Greek
          quarter of Constantinople of a manuscript containing (1) a
          synopsis of the Old and New Testaments in the order given by St.
          Chrysostom; (2) The Epistle of Barnabas; (3) The First Epistle
          of Clement of Rome to the Corinthians; (4) The Second Epistle of
          Clement to the Corinthians; (5) The Teaching of the Twelve
          Apostles; (6) The spurious letter of Mary of Cassoboli; and (7)
          Twelve pseudo-Ignatian Epistles. He edited the Epistles to the
          Corinthians with prolegomena and notes at Constantinople in
          1875, and published the "Teaching of the Twelve Apostles" in the
          same city in 1883. See [568]Didache.

   Buchanan, Claudius
          BUCHANAN, CLAUDIUS: A pioneer of modern Anglican missionary work
          in India; b. at Cambuslang, near Glasgow, Mar. 12, 1766; d. at
          Broxbourne (5 m. s.e. of Hertford), Hertfordshire, Feb. 9, 1815.
          At sixteen he went to the University of Glasgow, intending to
          study law, but, after finishing his course, spent three years in
          a careless wandering life. Smitten by repentance, he placed
          himself under the care of John Newton, the celebrated
          evangelical preacher in London, one of whose friends enabled him
          to spend four years at Cambridge. In 1796 he went to Calcutta as
          a chaplain in the East India Company's service. He found the
          conditions there very unfavorable for earnest work. All the
          Company was willing to do for sixty millions of souls was to
          place a chaplain here and there, who was told not to meddle with
          the native population. While Buchanan was waiting for a chance
          to do real work, he learned Hindustani and Persian. In 1800,
          being transferred to Calcutta itself, he found a like-minded
          helper in Lord Mornington (later Marquis of Wellesley), the
          Governor-general, who founded a college in Calcutta for the
          teaching of the Oriental languages and placed Buchanan in charge
          of it. It was closed, however, three years later, and all looked
          as dark as ever. But after a while a new institute was founded,
          on a smaller scale, and Buchanan took hope once more. In 1805 he
          published his Expediency of an Ecclesiastical Establishment for
          India, in which he developed the first plan for the
          establishment of regular dioceses and bishops. While waiting for
          his seed to bear fruit, he translated the New Testament into
          Hindustani and Persian, and founded an institute for such work.
          In 1806 he made an extended journey along the Malabar coast,
          partly for his health and partly in the missionary interest,
          publishing his observations in Christian Researches in Asia
          (Cambridge, 1811, new ed., London, 1840). He returned to
          Calcutta in 1807, full of plans for which the time was once more
          unfavorable. Lord Wellesley had been recalled, and his
          successor, Lord Minto, looked coldly on such projects, as did
          the Company in general. To push his views in England was the
          most necessary thing, and Buchanan returned thither in 1808 to
          press upon the ministry the setting up of a theological seminary
          in each presidency, the granting of licenses to missionaries,
          and the appointment of bishops. Lord Liverpool approved this
          plan, but the House of Commons agreed to the appointment of only
          one bishop. Middleton, the first bishop of Calcutta, was
          consecrated in 1816, and when his successor was provided with
          suffragans for Madras and Bombay, Buchanan's plan had been
          realized in its essentials, though he did not live to see it.

   Buchanan, George
          BUCHANAN, GEORGE: Scotch scholar; b. in the parish of Killearn
          (44 m. w.n.w. of Edinburgh), Stirlingshire, early in Feb., 1506;
          d. in Edinburgh Sept. 28, 1582. He studied in Paris, 1520-22, at
          St. Andrews, 1525, and again in Paris, where be became teacher
          in the College of Ste. Barbe, 1528; returned to Scotland 1535.
          He inclined toward Protestant views and wrote two satires on the
          monks, the Somnium and the Franciscanus et fratres, for which he
          was obliged to leave his country in 1539. He taught at Paris,
          Bordeaux, and Coimbra, and was active in the production of
          literary works; to this period belong his translations into
          Latin of the Medea and of the Alcestis and his Latin tragedies,
          Jephthes and Baptistes (translated into English verse by A.
          Gibb, Edinburgh, 1870; and by A. Gordon Mitchell, Paisley,
          1903-04); he began his translation of the Psalms into Latin
          (published at Paris, 1566) while confined in a monastery by the
          Inquisition at Coimbra. In 1562 he was acting as tutor to Mary
          Stuart in Scotland; he now openly embraced Protestantism and
          became influential in both Church and State; was an ardent
          supporter of Moray (who made him principal of St. Leonard's
          College, St. Andrews, in 1566), and an active opponent of the
          queen. In 1570 he became tutor to the young James VI. and keeper
          of the privy seal; his royal pupil he undertook to make "the
          greatest scholar in the land." During the last period of his
          life he wrote his two greatest works, the De jure regni apud
          Scotos (Edinburgh, 1579; Eng. transl., 1680), a defense of
          limited monarchy, suppressed by act of parliament in 1584 and
          again in 1664 and burned at Oxford in 1683; and the Rerum
          Scoticarum historia (1582; 19th ed., 1762; Eng. transl., 1690).
          His works have been edited by Ruddiman (2 vols., Edinburgh,
          1715; reprinted by Burman, Leyden, 1725).

          Bibliography: The Leyden ed. of the Works contains a full

   Buchanites
          BUCHANITES: The followers of Elspat (or Elspeth) Simpson, wife
          of Robert Buchan, a journeyman potter at Greenock, Scotland. She
          was born at Fatmacken, between Banff and Portsoy, 1738 was
          brought up in the Scottish Episcopal Church; while a servant at
          Greenock she married and followed her husband into the Burgher
          Succession Church. In 1781 she separated from him and removed
          with her children to Glasgow. In 1783 she joined the Dowhill
          Relief church at Irvine, whose pastor was the Rev. Hugh White.
          She had already adopted fantastic views as to religion and
          claimed to be a teacher sent from heaven. She got a hearing, her
          chief converts being Mr. White, who proclaimed that she was the
          woman spoken of in Rev. iii. 1 sqq. and that he was the
          man-child she had brought forth. The Relief presbytery deposed
          Mr. White from the ministry, and when converts to Mrs. Buchan's
          pretensions began to gather, the parish authorities in May,
          1784, compelled the whole band to leave. They settled on a farm
          at New Cample, near Closeburn, Dumfriesshire, and there the sect
          grew to about fifty members, some of whom were superior persons.
          Mrs. Buchan was called "spiritual mother" by her followers, and
          professed to be able to impart the Holy Spirit by breathing on
          the candidate; also to be a prophetess, and as such foretold
          that neither she nor her followers would ever die but would meet
          the Lord in the air in the advent which she taught was at hand,
          basing her teaching on I Thess. iv. 17. The usual charge of
          sexual immorality was brought against the sect, the most
          distinguished witness being the poet Robert Burns, who is said
          to have had a lady-love in the sect (see his letter to John
          Burness, dated August, 1784). His song "As I was a walking" was
          set to an air which was a favorite with the Buchanites. In May,
          1791, Mrs. Buchan died. This, being in direct contradiction to
          her teaching, had a disastrous effect on her sect which then
          began to disintegrate, but the last adherent of it did not pass
          away till 1848.

          reputation of Boston. He superintended the publication of the
          American edition of Griesbach's Greek Testament (1808); two
          volumes of sermons, with memoir by Rev. S. C. Thacher, were
          published after his death (Boston, 1814; 1829), and his Works
          appeared in two volumes in 1839.

          Bibliography: His Memoir (together with that of his father, Rev.
          Joseph Buckminster of Portsmouth, N. H.; b. 1751; d. 1812) was
          published by his sister, Eliza B. Lee, Boston, 1851.

          Bensberg (9 m. e. of Cologne) Apr. 13, 1850. He was educated at
          the universities of Bonn, Berlin, and Utrecht from 1868 to 1873,
          although his studies were interrupted in 1870-71, when he served
          in the Franco-Prussian War. He became privat-docent for the Old

   Buddeus, Johannes Franciscus
          BUDDEUS, bud´´dê´us, JOHANNES FRANCISCUS (Johann Franz Budde):
          German theologian and philosopher; b. at Anclam (47 m. n.w, of
          Stettin), Pomerania, where his father was pastor, June 25, 1667;
          d. at Gotha Nov. 19, 1729. He early received a thorough
          education in classical and Oriental languages, and had read the
          Bible through in the original before he went to the University
          of Wittenberg in 1685. He was appointed adjunct professor of
          philosophy there soon after taking his master's degree in 1687,
          and in 1689 exchanged this for a similar position at Jena, where
          he also paid much attention to the study of history. In 1692 he
          went to Coburg as professor of Greek and Latin, and the next
          year to the new University of Halle as professor of moral
          philosophy. Here he remained until 1705, when he went to Jena as
          second professor of theology. His lectures embraced all branches
          of this science, and frequently touched on philosophy, history,
          and politics. Respected by all as a man and a Christian, he
          remained at Jena for the rest of his life, several times acting
          as rector of the university temporarily and being head of his
          department and an ecclesiastical councilor from 1715. He was
          considered the most universally accomplished German theologian
          of his time. In philosophy he professed an eclecticism which
          rested on a broad historical foundation; but he recognized in
          Descartes the originator of a new period, and in attacking the
          "atheist" Spinoza followed especially the upholders of the law
          of nature, such as Hugo Grotius, Puffendorf, and Thomasius. His
          theological position was determined by the tradition of Musæus
          at Jena, partly through his close relations with Baier; but on
          another side he was inclined toward Pietism. His association
          with Spangenberg, Spener, and Zinzendorf brought him under
          suspicion and actually gave rise to a formal investigation of
          his doctrine. In certain ways, too, he was influenced by the
          federalist theology, but without allowing it to lead him beyond
          the bounds of Lutheran orthodoxy. In all departments he showed
          himself a man of sound learning and scholarly instincts. His
          work was epoch-making in church history, especially that dealing
          with the Old Testament and the apostolic age. Taken as a whole,
          the life of Buddeus belongs to the transition period which
          follows that of simple orthodoxy; the influence of a new age and
          new leading interests appears in him, and at times he seems to
          be conscious of the change. Yet in his Biblical criticism he did
          not get so far as to make the slightest concession; not a verse
          of a canonical book can be touched without injuring the
          perfection of the whole. As an academic teacher he attained
          great success, and he had the gift of a striking and pregnant
          style, especially in Latin. His works, great and small, number
          over a hundred. Of those published in the Halle period may be
          mentioned Elementa philosophiæ practicæ (1697) and Elementa
          philosophiæ eclecticæ (1703). To the second Jena period belong
          among others the Institutiones theologiæ moralis (1711; German
          transl., 1719), a work strictly in accordance with his
          philosophical ethics; the Historia ecclesiastica veteris
          testamenti (1715-18); Theses theologicæ de atheismo et
          superstitione (1716), which, directed especially against
          Spinoza, attracted much attention; Institutiones theologiæ
          dogmaticæ, (1723), a work once very influential, obviously
          founded on Baier's Compendium; Historische und theologische
          Einleitung in die vornehmsten Religionsstreitigkeiten (1724,
          1728), edited by Walch; Isagoge historico-theologica ad
          theologiam universam (1727), dealing with the problems methods,
          and history of theology in a way remarkable for that time; and
          Ecclesia apostolica (1729), intended as an introduction to the
          study of the New Testament.

          Buddhism is the religion established in India by Buddha in the
          sixth, century B.C., and having, according to a conservative
          estimate, upward of 100,000,000 adherents at the present time,
          chiefly in Ceylon, Nepal, Tibet, Farther India, China, and
          Japan. While frequently regarded as a new religion, it is,
          strictly speaking, only a reformation of Brahmanism, and can not
          be understood without some knowledge of the conditions preceding
          it. The religious system of India as outlined in its oldest
          religious books, the Vedas, had reached in the Brahmanas and
          Sutras a degree of ritualism such as, perhaps, never existed
          elsewhere (see [571]Brahmanism). This formalism produced a
          revolt, and from time to time arose various teachers,
          philosophers, and reformers, of whom the most influential was
          Siddhartha, also known as Sakya, Sakyamuni, Gautama, and, most
          frequently, as Buddha.

    1. Life of Buddha.

          Buddha, the son of Suddhodana, king of Kapilavastu, a city in
          the district of Gorakhpur, Oudh, was born in 557 B.C. in the
          grove of Lumbini, two miles from the capital. He was, therefore,
          like Mahavira, the founder of the rival system of [572]Jainism,
          a member of the Kshatriya or warrior caste. The details of the
          life of the Buddha, or "The Enlightened One," so far as they may
          be verified historically, are comparatively few. He lost his
          mother, whom the later texts name Maya, at a very early age, and
          he married while still young, according to Hindu custom, and had
          a son called Rahula. At the age of twenty-nine (528 B.C.), he
          renounced his succession to the throne and became a hermit.
          Herein there is nothing extraordinary, for Brahmanism divided
          life into the four stages of student, householder, hermit, and
          ascetic. Two of these the prince had already performed; two more
          yet remained for him, and he went forth to win knowledge of the
          truth by penance and meditation. From the first he gained
          nothing, nor could his teachers help him, while his five
          companions abandoned him as unfitted to receive a knowledge of
          the truth. In his wanderings he came to Uruvela, the modern
          Buddha Gaya in Bengal. There, in 521 B.C., after seven years of
          struggle, he received illumination while sitting in meditation
          beneath the sacred bo-tree (Ficus religiosa or pipul-tree). Thus
          the Bodhisattva, or potential Buddha, became a true Buddha or
          Tathagata, "the Perfected One." He now entered upon the fourth
          and the last stage of life, and became a wandering ascetic and
          teacher. His earliest followers were the five monks who had
          turned from him before, and as other converts were made they
          were sent as apostles of the doctrine. Favor was his in high
          places also, for Bimbisara, king of Magadha, became an adherent
          of the faith. Over all ranks and classes Buddha exercised a
          powerful influence, due, it is very possible, rather to his
          personal charm of manner than to any essential novelty of the
          doctrine which he taught. It was undoubtedly in great part the
          result of his disregard of the fundamental Hindu principle of
          caste that he won for himself so large a following. Peaceably
          and calmly the life of Buddha passed, with little opposition,
          save from his cousin Devadatta, who attempted, from motives of
          personal ambition, to rouse hostility against his kinsman. At
          the age of eighty the Buddha felt that his end was drawing near,
          and for the first time in his life severe illness befell him. At
          the village of Kusinara, about thirty miles west of Kathmandu,
          the capital of Nepal, the master passed away (477 B.C.).

    2. Legendary Additions.

          About the life here outlined the mythopeic tendencies of the
          Oriental mind wove a web of legend. In course of time Buddha no
          longer stands alone. He is the successor of twenty-seven Buddhas
          and himself received recognition from twenty-four of them,
          passing through a hundred thousand world cycles and countless
          reincarnations before he reached the perfection which was
          requisite for his high mission. When in him all perfection and
          all knowledge was united, the gods besought him to be born on
          earth, and in answer to their prayer he entered the womb of Maya
          in the form of a white elephant, while thirty-two signs of
          wonder appeared and the ten thousand worlds trembled at the
          coming of the savior of the world. At the end of ten months, the
          Buddha was born beneath a sal-tree in the grove of Lumbini,
          while gods and men did homage unto him. On the fifth day of his
          life the Brahman Kondanna prophesied to Suddhodana the king that
          the child was destined to become a Buddha when he should see
          four signs of evil omen, an old man, a sick man, a corpse, and a
          monk. By every means within his power the father sought to keep
          his son from seeing these sights, surrounding him with every
          luxury, and marrying him in his sixteenth year to his cousin
          Yasodhara, the daughter of Suprabuddha. It was all in vain,
          however, for Siddhartha beheld the four signs, realized the
          misery of life, and abandoned the palace. On the expiration of
          his seven years of wandering, he realized that he was at last to
          gain Buddhahood, and amid many marvels he sat down beneath the
          bo-tree facing the East. Fruitlessly did Mara, the leader of the
          host of evil, endeavor to terrify the Bodhisattva. The
          blandishments of his daughters, Desire, Pining, and Lust, and
          his more subtle temptation that the Buddha should at once enter
          Nirvana without proclaiming his saving knowledge to mankind,
          failed ignominiously. From the time of his illumination until
          his death few myths gather about the Buddha, but when he was
          about to die there were marvels, and the course of nature was
          again disturbed, until the Tathagata passed to Nirvana.

    3. Buddha's Teaching.

          The key-note of Buddhism is the transitoriness and vanity of
          life, which is conditioned by karma, the fruit of deeds done in
          countless previous lives; nor can existence be ended before the
          expiration of many reincarnations devoted to works of holiness
          and spent in unceasing efforts to gain Nirvana. Three elements
          common to all post-Vedic Hindu thought are at once discernible
          in this teaching; viz., transmigration, karma, and the
          dissolution of individuality. In its shortest form Buddha's
          teaching may be summarized as follows: Birth is sorrow, age is
          sorrow, sickness is sorrow, death is sorrow, clinging to earthly
          things is sorrow. Birth and rebirth, the chain of reincarnation,
          result from the thirst for life together with passion and
          desire. The only escape from this thirst is to follow the
          Eightfold Path: Right belief, right resolve, right word, right
          act, right life, right effort, right thinking, right meditation.

    4. Nirvana.

          The goal of Buddhism is Nirvana. A definition of this term is
          almost impossible for the simple reason that Buddha himself gave
          no clear idea, and in all probability possessed none, of this
          state. He was indeed asked by more than one of his disciples
          whether Nirvana was postmundane or postcelestial existence, or
          whether it was annihilation. To all these questions, however, he
          refused an answer, for it was characteristic of his teachings
          that they were practically confined to the present life, and
          concerned themselves but little either with problems of merely
          academic philosophy or with the unknowable. Some measure of
          light, however, may be gained from the orthodox systems of
          Indian philosophy which are based upon the doctrine of the
          divine inspiration of the Veda. According to all of these, the
          summum bonum is release from karma and reincarnation, a goal
          which is to be attained by knowledge, and which consists in
          absorption into or reunion with the Over-Soul. This involves the
          annihilation of individuality, and in this sense Nirvana is
          nihilism, so that with the tacit ignoring of any real conception
          of the divine in the teachings of Buddha, Nirvana seems to imply
          the annihilation of the soul rather than its absorption. It is
          noteworthy, furthermore, that the word Nirvana etymologically
          denotes "a blowing out," the extinguishing of the fires of
          hatred, infatuation, and all passions. Nirvana seems to have
          been twofold, a secondary condition which may be reached by the
          righteous in this life, and the blessed state of freedom from
          rebirth.

          Surpassing the teachers who had preceded him, Buddha denied both
          the authority of the Vedas, whose recognition, however formal,
          constitutes orthodoxy in India, and the power of sacrifice,
          while he practically ignored the existence of the divine. He
          rejected the entire system of caste, thus unconsciously
          preparing his doctrines to be potentially a world-religion
          instead of an ethnic faith. In the later Buddhist theology an
          elaborate cosmology is developed, with thirty-one worlds
          inhabited by fourteen classes of beings, of which the three
          highest are the supreme Buddhas, Pratyekabuddhas, and Arhats,
          the latter being those who are almost ready to attain Nirvana,
          while the Pratyekabuddha has attained the knowledge necessary to
          Nirvana but does not preach it. In addition to these must be
          noted the Bodhisattva, a potential Buddha who will attain to
          Buddhahood in due time.

    5. Buddhist Monks.

          Even in his lifetime Buddha established an order, thus forming
          the "triple jewel," Buddha, Dhamma (the law), and Sangha (the
          congregation). In this order were gathered the followers of the
          teacher, who were bound by the ten vows: neither to kill nor to
          steal, to abstain from impurity, falsehood, and intoxicating
          drinks, not to eat at forbidden times, to abstain from the folly
          of dancing, singing, music, and the theater, to use no manner of
          adornment, not to sleep in a high or a broad bed, and to receive
          neither gold nor silver. The monks, who were bound to celibacy
          and poverty, and were called, in old Hindu fashion, bhikkus, or
          beggars, might be received as novices at the age of seven or
          eight, although they could not be ordained before their
          twentieth year. Twice a month the monks of each monastery
          assembled for the confession of sins, and annually in the rainy
          season a retreat was held both for rest from the pilgrimages of
          the preceding year and to gain new strength for the coming
          season. Even in the lifetime of Buddha women were admitted to
          the order and nunneries were built for their accommodation.

    6. Development after Buddha's Death.

          The history of Buddhism is a curious bit of irony; the founder
          who had ignored the existence of a god himself became a god. In
          Southern India, however, the religion remained relatively pure,
          although some heretical doctrines crept in at an early period
          and a number of councils were held to maintain the faith in its
          integrity. The first of these took place at Rajagaha in the year
          of Buddha's death, the second at Vaisali about a century later,
          the third, a sectarian meeting, at Pataliputra about 246 B.C.,
          and the fourth at Jalandhara under the Indo-Scythian king
          Kanishka in 78 A.D. The religion gained royal approval at an
          early date, its great kingly adherent being Asoka, who was
          crowned at Pataliputra in Madagha about 259 B.C. and reigned
          thirty-seven years. Not only did he spread the faith throughout
          his dominions, but his son Mahendra carried the new creed to
          Ceylon. In the second century B.C. the Indo-Scythian kings of
          Cabul and Bactria established Buddhism in their lands, whence it
          was promulgated in Northwestern India. Thus the faith spread by
          degrees over all the country north of the Vindhyas, existing
          side by side with Brahmanism and Jainism in harmony and peace.
          Its downfall in the land of its birth was due to two causes, the
          conflict of the sects which arose within itself and the
          Mohammedan invasion of India, but there was no persecution by
          the other Hindu sects. In Ceylon, on the other hand, Buddhism
          still exists, especially in the southern part of the island, and
          it is there that the purest Buddhism is found.

    7. Buddhist Sects.

          It was but natural that divergent opinions should arise within
          the faith itself. These remained comparatively unimportant,
          however, until the schism into the Mahayana and Hinayana, or the
          "Great Vehicle" and "Little Vehicle." The latter still adhered
          strictly in the main to the original tenets of Buddhism,
          although it was subdivided into the Vaibhashikas and the
          Sautrantikas, the former laying special stress on the
          "Abhidhammapitaka" or metaphysical section of the sacred books
          of the religion, and the latter on the "Suttapitaka " or
          discourses of the Buddha. The Mahayanists, on the contrary, who
          form by far the larger sect, devoted themselves to all manner of
          speculation, being influenced not only by Hinduism but at a
          later period by [573]Shamanism as well. The Mahayana postulates
          the existence of a thousand Buddhas with a supreme god, the
          Adibuddha, and prefers beneficent activity to the passivity of
          the Buddha's own doctrines, although both the principal
          subdivisions of this sect, the Yogacaras and the Madhyamikas,
          are strictly idealistic, and in so far are orthodox Hindus.

    8. The Dhyani-Buddhas.

          Buddhism was introduced into Tibet about the seventh century
          A.D., when it was already permeated by Saivaite and Tantric
          Hinduism and by Mahayanism, while under the influence of
          Mongolian Shamanism it departed still more from its original
          ideal. Here is evolved the concept of the Dhyani-Buddhas, the
          celestial types of the Buddhas which appear on earth as men
          (Manushi-Buddhas). These Dhayani-Buddhas, who are five in
          number, watch over the welfare of the world between the
          incarnations of the Manushi-Buddhas, although they themselves
          never become incarnate. Three of them correspond to the three
          Buddhas who preceded Gautama in the present age of the world;
          one, Amitabha, to the historical Buddha, whose earthly
          reincarnation is the lesser Lama of Tibet; and the fifth is the
          Dhyani-Bodhisatva Padmapani or Avalokitesvara, who is
          represented on earth by the Dalai-Lama at Lhassa, and is the
          type of the Bodhisatva Maitreya, the future earthly Buddha and
          the savior of the world. See [574]Lamaism.

          Buddhism was introduced into China in its Mahayanistic form by
          the emperor Mingti in 61 A.D., and despite persecutions,
          especially under the Tang dynasty (620-907), it has survived
          there until the present day, although overlaid with superstition
          and consisting in great part in the worship of pictures and
          relics. It has gained, however, only a subordinate place in
          China, being unable to compete either with the popular Taoism or
          the cultured Confucianism, despite the fact that the three
          religions exist peaceably side by side. From China Buddhism was
          carried to Japan, where numerous sects have arisen, although the
          results have been little more than a further departure from the
          original faith (see [575]China, I., 3; [576]Japan, I., II., 2).

    9. Buddhism and Christianity.

          Some scholars would like to derive the gospel narrative from
          Buddhism, but it is a significant fact that an overwhelming
          majority of Oriental scholars have decided that the story of
          Buddha has had no influence on the canonical life of Christ.
          They reach this conclusion by a comparison of elements of the
          Buddha legend composed long after the death of the teacher with
          the Gospels. The Buddhist parallels are drawn, moreover, in the
          main, from the texts of the Northern school, which are
          confessedly late and mythopeic to a degree which almost totally
          obscures the figure of the historic Buddha, while some of the
          so-called cogent Christian parallels are based upon the
          apocryphal Gospels. Considering the canonical Gospels on the one
          hand and the texts of the Southern Buddhism on the other, the
          parallels between the lives of Jesus and Buddha seem to resolve
          themselves into those which are natural in the case of great
          religious teachers. Thus of five parallels mentioned by Seydel,
          the ablest advocate of the theory of Buddhistic influence on
          Christianity, the three most important are the presentation of
          the infant Jesus in the temple compared with that of the infant
          Buddha; the fast of Jesus and that of Buddha; and the
          preexistence of Jesus and of Buddha in heaven. Of these the
          presentation of Buddha is found neither in the writings of the
          Southern school nor in the ancient text of the Northern, while
          at the time of Jesus it was usual for a pious mother to attend
          the temple for the redemption of the first-born and her own
          ritual purification. The account of the fasting and temptation
          is not entirely harmonious in both accounts. Buddha first
          over-comes Mara and then fasts forty-nine days, while Jesus
          fasts forty days and is then tempted by the devil. Not only is
          the account of the Gospels the more accurate psychologically,
          but it may be paralleled with similar events in the lives of
          Moses and Elijah, while the story of the temptation is found not
          only in Buddhism and Christianity, but also in Zoroastrianism.
          The third parallel of the pre-existence of Jesus and Buddha is
          equally discrepant. Jesus existed in heaven from all eternity
          and is unique in such existence, while Buddha merely shares the
          history of all other Buddhas and was reincarnated on earth
          countless times. It must be borne in mind that the spirit of the
          two religions as of their founders is entirely divergent. The
          tragedy and the majesty of the Christ is very different from the
          peacefulness and the sweetness of Buddha. Jesus sought to save
          the world, not himself. Buddha began by saving himself and then
          taught the world. The aim of Jesus is faith and individual
          existence in heaven in the presence of God; the summum bonum of
          Buddha is knowledge and the annihilation of self in Nirvana. In
          the face of such essential divergencies, the parallels alleged
          to exist between Buddha and Jesus seem to be cases of accidental
          coincidence, and it is almost certain that, despite the travel
          between Palestine and India, which may have influenced to some
          degree the apocryphal Gospels on the one hand and late Northern
          Buddhism on the other, Christianity and Buddhism developed to
          all intents and purposes independently. For esoteric Buddhism
          (so called), see [577]Theosophy.

   Budé, Guillaume
          BUDÉ, bü´´dê´, GUILLAUME: French humanist; b. at Paris 1467; d.
          there Aug. 23, 1540. He studied law at Orléans, and, after
          leading a dissipated life for several years, began to apply
          himself to Greek, philosophy, theology, and science. Well
          received at court, he was repeatedly entrusted with diplomatic
          missions to Rome. On Aug. 21, 1522, Francis I. appointed him
          librarian of the royal library at Fontainebleau and royal
          councilor, and it was owing to Budé's initiative that the king
          enlarged the Royal Library of Paris and also the Royal College,
          which afterward became the Collége de France. Long before
          Luther, Budé had felt the necessity of reforms in the Church,
          but, like many scholars and bishops of his day, he feared a
          rupture with Rome. Among his numerous works, special mention may
          be made of the following: De Asse et partibus ejus (Paris,
          1514); De Studio bonarum litterarum recte et commode instituendo
          (1527); Commentarii linguæ græcæ (1529); De transitu Hellenismi
          ad Christianismum (1535); Forensia quibus vulgares et vere
          latinæ jurisconsultorum loquendi formulæ dantur (1548); and
          Lexicon græco-latinum (Geneva, 1554 etc.).

          examining board, in Stuttgart from 1868 to 1872. In the latter
          year he became associate professor of dogmatics and New
          Testament exegesis and supervisor of the theological seminary of
          the University of Tübingen, where he was full professor from
          1877. Retired from active duties, 1910. He has written Ueber die

          studies, he became minister in his native place, superintendent
          at Brüsson, and in 1846 pastor of St. Matthew's at Berlin. In
          1853 he was made superintendent general, but retired from the
          ministry in 1884. He belonged to the most prominent and
          influential preachers of the German capital, and was the author
          of Erinnerungen aus dem Leben eines Landgeistlichen (5 vols.,
          Berlin, 1888-97), which went through many editions.

   Bugenhagen, Johann

  BUGENHAGEN, bu´´gen-hê´gen, JOHANN:

    Early Life.

          A leader of the German Reformation b. at Wollin (29 m. n. of
          Stettin), Pomerania, June 24, 1485; d. at Wittenberg Apr. 20,
          1558. He was educated at the University of Greifswald, paying
          special attention to the Latin classics. In his eighteenth year
          he was placed in charge of the school at Treptow on the Rega,
          which he made famous far and wide by the thorough Renaissance
          devotion to study which he inculcated. In 1509 he was ordained
          priest, though without any special theological training
          Humanism, in fact, strongly influenced his theology. He turned
          away from the schoolmen to seek a purer doctrine in the early
          Fathers, and by Erasmus, whom he considered to represent them,
          was brought to a deep study of the Bible. In 1517 he was
          appointed to lecture on the Bible and the Fathers in the new
          monastic school of Belbuck. A journey throughout Pomerania in
          search of documents to aid in Spalatin's historical work led to
          the publication of its results in his Pomerania (1518), in which
          he foreshadows his later career by incidental attacks on the
          preachers of indulgences; and a sermon delivered before a
          clerical assembly in 1519 (or 1520) is even more outspoken in
          its reproof of abuses. Not long after, Luther's writings fell
          into his hands. He was at first shocked by the Captivitas
          Babylonica, but further reading convinced him of its truth. An
          earnest correspondence with Luther followed, and in 1521
          Bugenhagen went to Wittenberg, sending back to Treptow a long
          letter in which he declared his adhesion to his new master's
          doctrines.

    At Wittenberg.

          He matriculated at the university, made friends with
          Melanchthon, and began to expound the Psalms to an increasing
          audience. The swift development of practical reform carried him
          with it, and he married in 1522, in spite of the uncertainty of
          his future. Luther exerted himself to find a position for him,
          and, a vacancy occurring in the principal church of Wittenberg,
          put his useful follower in, despite the protests of the
          capitular body to whom the right of nomination really belonged.
          Here Bugenhagen busied himself in many practical pastoral works,
          finding time for literary activity also; he helped in the Low
          German edition of Luther's New Testament (1524), and in the same
          year published his lectures on the Psalms and Latin commentaries
          on several other books of Scripture. These, as well as some
          German treatises on practical piety, made his name known, and he
          was called to St. Nicholas's church at Hamburg. The town council
          objected, and the proposal fell through. Bugenhagen came,
          however, to the help of the evangelical community in Hamburg in
          the following year by his tractate Von dem Christenloven und
          rechten guden Werken (published 1526; High German version in
          Vogt), which is one of the best popular presentations of the
          Lutheran teaching. In 1525 he officiated at Luther's marriage,
          and wrote a defense of the married clergy. Besides his faithful
          pastoral labors, continued even through the plague of 1527, he
          took part in the general movement of the Reformation by a letter
          "to the Christians in England" (1525), by taking a prominent
          part against Zwingli and Butzer in the eucharistic controversy,
          and by new exegetical works.

    His Ability as an Organizer.

          Bugenhagen's forte, however, was organization, which he carried
          forward in many parts of North Germany, in both ecclesiastical
          and educational matters. The results of his activity were seen,
          for example, in the new church constitutions of Brunswick,
          Hamburg, Lübeck, and Pomerania. In 1535 he came back to spend
          two years in his duties at Wittenberg, and became a member of
          the theological faculty. He was called away once more in 1537 to
          superintend the carrying out of the reforming movement in
          Denmark, which had been begun the year before, when Christian
          III. had broken the power of the bishops and confiscated their
          property. He revised the proposed constitution, crowned the king
          and queen at Copenhagen, ordained seven evangelical theologians
          as superintendents to take the place of the expelled bishops,
          and reorganized the university, which he governed for a time as
          rector, working meanwhile at his great commentary on the Psalms,
          not completed till 1544. Returning home in the spring of 1539,
          he took part in the thorough revision of Luther's Bible, and
          stood by him in the conflict with Agricola (see
          [579]Antinomianism and Antinomian Controversies, II., 1, § 3).
          He declined a call to the bishopric of Sleswick, and another to
          the University of Copenhagen; but he visited Holstein in 1542,
          at the king's invitation, to assist in the adoption and
          adaptation of the Danish church constitution for the duchies. No
          sooner had he returned than the success of the arms of the
          Schmalkald League against Henry of Brunswick laid a new task
          upon him, together with Corvinus and Görlitz; viz., that of
          organizing an Evangelical Church in the conquered territory. The
          constitution for Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel which appeared in the
          autumn of 1543 is mostly his work, and that adopted for
          Hildesheim in the following year is practically derived from it.
          Yet the difficulties which he had experienced in this visitation
          were sufficient, it would seem, to make him reluctant to accept
          the invitation of the duke of Pomerania to take the place of the
          deceased bishop of Kammin; and when the duke would have no
          conditional acceptance, he declined absolutely, though
          professing his willingness to assist for a time in organization.

    Last Years.

          Bugenhagen remained, accordingly, at Wittenberg, a help and
          strength to Luther in his last years, and preached his funeral
          sermon on Feb. 22, 1546. In the troublous times that followed,
          he adhered undauntedly to the cause of the Wittenberg church,
          encouraged the citizens during the siege, and went on preaching
          even after the emperor had entered the city as conqueror. The
          consideration with which he was treated by Charles V. and the
          new elector Maurice, and his desire to serve the university and
          to remain connected with it, combined to reconcile him to the
          new state of things more readily than some ardent evangelicals
          thought fitting. There was much criticism of his action from his
          own side, and calumny even went so far as to accuse him of
          venality. He was drawn into the policy of the Interim still
          further, as conducted by Maurice of Saxony and represented
          theologically by Melanchthon. His personal share in the
          negotiations was, indeed, a slight one; he was in the opposition
          at Alten-Zelle, and was consequently not summoned to Jüterbogk.
          But the concessions made to the Roman Catholic ceremonial found
          a sympathizer in the man who had impressed upon North German
          Lutheranism a conservative approximation to the old forms; he
          overlooked the fact that, as Hering has truly said, what had
          originally been consideration for the weak brethren might now be
          only obsequious deference to the powerful. His attitude cost him
          the confidence of the deposed elector and of Albert of Prussia,
          and not a few of his old friends turned from him. As an attempt
          to set himself right, he published in 1550 his commentary on
          Jonah, in which he gave vigorous expression to his undiminished
          protest against the Roman Catholic Church, undertaking to derive
          its doctrines and practises from the Montanist heresy. He raised
          his voice during the troubles of 1556 in a warning to all
          pastors to prepare for the end of the world by confession of sin
          and firm adherence to their faith. Decaying bodily strength
          forced him to give up preaching in 1557, and a year later he
          went to his long rest, being buried near the altar in the church
          he had served so long. He left behind him many a trace of his
          organizing abilities throughout northern Germany, especially in
          Lower Saxony, of his wisdom in practical matters, his sensible
          views on education, and his liturgical institutions, which
          substantially determined the abiding character of North German
          Lutheranism.

   Bulgaria
          BULGARIA: A principality under the suzerainty of Turkey in the
          northeastern part of the Balkan Peninsula, bounded on the north
          by Rumania, on the east by the Black Sea, on the south by
          Turkey, on the west by Servia. It was created by the Treaty of
          Berlin in 1878 and attained its present extent in 1885 by the
          addition of Eastern Rumelia (the territory south of the Balkan
          Mountains) after a revolt of the Bulgars there; in 1908 it
          proclaimed its independence; area, 38,080 square miles;
          population (1900), 3,744,283.

    Bulgarian Church.

          In race and religion the population is very diverse. The
          majority are the Bulgars, who number some 2,880,000 and belong
          to the Oriental Orthodox Church, their prince Boris having
          adopted Christianity in 864, two centuries after they had
          entered the region south of the Danube (see [581]Bulgarians,
          Conversion of the). Simeon, the successor of Boris as prince or
          czar, established an autonomous Church for his extensive
          domains, placing at its head a bishop, or exarch, who had his
          seat at Ochrida on the frontier of Albania. This diocese lapsed
          after the fall of the Bulgarian state, nor was it revived when
          the principality was reorganized. The Slavic bishoprics were
          gradually replaced with Greek, and the Bulgarian Church was
          first restored in 1870-72, when, through the insistence of
          Russian diplomats, the Sultan permitted the Bulgarian Church to
          separate from the patriarchate and to appoint an exarch in
          Constantinople who should be the Slavic head of all those
          communities which might wish to join the new ecclesiastical
          body. Although condemned by the patriarch in 1872 as schismatic,
          large numbers of Slavs in the Turkish provinces soon declared
          themselves Bulgarians.

    Organization.

          The governing body of this Church is the Holy Synod, which
          consists of four bishops chosen for four years by secret ballot
          of all the bishops and presided over by the exarch; it meets
          annually in May. The rights and external organization of the
          Bulgarian Church are recognized throughout the principality by
          the constitution, which declares it to be the State Church.
          Other religions are tolerated, however, while the exarch can
          issue commands to his bishops only after reaching an agreement
          with the minister of foreign affairs. According to the exarchial
          statute of 1883, the laity exercise a considerable influence on
          the election of bishops, and, with the Turkish districts of the
          Bulgarian Church, even on the choice of the exarch. In each
          eparchy, or diocese, three clerical and three lay members form a
          committee which selects two names from a large list of
          candidates, sending these names to the Holy Synod, by which the
          list in question is drawn up and constantly renewed.

          In the principality of Bulgaria there are eleven dioceses, or
          eparchies, at Varna, Rustchuk (Cherven and Dorostol), Tirnova,
          Lovatz, Vratsa, and Widin north of the Balkans, and Sofia,
          Philippopolis, Stara Saghra, and Sliven south of this mountain
          range. These dioceses receive from the State an annual revenue
          of 800,000 francs, while the monasteries supply the funds for
          twenty-four archimandrites. One of the richest monasteries is
          that of St. John in the Rilo mountains, and other important
          cloisters are those of St. Nicholas near the Shipka Pass and
          Tcherepis at the northern end of the Isker gap. The majority of
          the parish clergy lack the requisite education, and the monks
          are very inferior in education to those of Servia. The parish
          priests are accordingly reverenced but little by the peasants
          and citizens. They number nearly 2,000, and there are 240 monks
          in seventy-eight monasteries.

    Other Churches.

          Not all the Slavs recognize the authority of the exarch, and in
          the southeast 60,000 Greeks have the four small dioceses of
          Varna, Mesembria, Sozopolis, and Anchiolo, as well as the
          metropolitanate of Philippopolis. Roman Catholicism has but
          scant representation in Bulgaria. Nicopolis is the name of the
          bishopric for Danubian Bulgaria, but in reality the bishop
          resides at Rustchuk. In the south is the apostolic vicariate of
          Sofia and Philippopolis, in charge of the Capuchins since 1841.
          The majority of the Roman Catholics are Bulgars, partly
          descended from the Paulicians, who were formerly numerous (see
          [582]Paulicians). The minority are immigrants from
          Austria-Hungary and other Roman Catholic countries, and have
          churches and small congregations in various cities along the
          Danube, as well as in Sofia, Philippopolis, and Burgas. The
          Armenians have their own bishop in Rustchuk. Bulgarian
          Protestants are mainly the result of American missionary
          propaganda. [The Methodists entered the country north of the
          Balkans in 1857 and the American Board commenced work south of
          the Balkans at about the same time. The educational work of
          Robert College near Constantinople has done much for the
          Bulgarians.] There are also Protestant communities of some 500
          Germans in Sofia and Rustchuk.

    Non-Christian Religions.

          The Jews in Bulgaria are for the most part descendants of exiles
          from Spain in the sixteenth century. The Gipsies number about
          50,000, although some of them declare themselves Orthodox. The
          great majority of the Mohammedans are Turks; the number has
          decreased owing to extensive emigration since 1878. They have
          many schools, including a theological school at Shumla.

          [The religious statistics of the census of 1900 are:

          Orthodox Greeks, 3,019,296; Mohammedans, 643,300; Jews, 33,663;
          Roman Catholics, 28,569; Armenian Gregorians, 13,809;
          Protestants, 4,524; Unknown, 1,122.]

   Bulgarian National Church in the United States, The
          BULGARIAN NATIONAL CHURCH IN THE UNITED STATES, THE: There are,
          according to moderate calculations, about 25,000 Bulgarians in
          the United States and Canada, the immigration of Bulgarians
          becoming greater since 1903. They have settled in large numbers
          at Granite City and Madison, Ill.; Hopkins, Mich.; and St.
          Louis, Mo., and are scattered also farther westward, while a
          considerable number of them are to be found in New York City,
          and also in Toronto and parts of northern Canada. The first
          Bulgarian church in the United States was built in 1907 in
          Madison, Ill., being followed by those at Granite City and St.
          Louis. There are at present three Bulgarian priests in the
          United States.

   Bulgarians, Conversion of the
          BULGARIANS, CONVERSION OF THE: According to Jire?ek, who follows
          Schafarik, the Bulgarians were originally related to the Finns.
          Jordanis says that they lived on the shores of the Black Sea in
          the fifth century, clashing frequently with the Ostrogoths in
          the reign of Theodoric, who, according to Ennodius, checked
          their victorious advance toward the west in 487; Cassiodorus
          mentions another victory in 504. But their attacks were directed
          also against the Byzantine Empire. Under Constantine Pogonatus a
          Bulgarian horde established itself in 679 between the Danube and
          the Balkans, extending their conquests gradually as far as the
          mouth of the Save. This territory seems to have been inhabited
          by people of Slavic race, who first gave their language to the
          conquerors and then gradually amalgamated with them. The race
          formed by this fusion was so strongly pagan that it resisted,
          the introduction of Christianity, which had its martyrs in the
          first half of the ninth century. A change set in under Bogoris
          (c. 852-888), who in his contests with both Franks and Greeks
          held out hopes of a conversion as an inducement for peace. In
          864 he seems to have entered the Greek Church, and received in
          return a considerable slice of territory. In Constantinople his
          conversion was considered genuine, and Photius took pains to
          instruct him at some length in the duties of a Christian prince.
          The Bulgarians were apparently less delighted, and rose in armed
          revolt. The wily barbarian, however, had one eye on the West,
          and at the same time sent an embassy to Pope Nicholas I., with a
          number of questions on which he sought enlightenment from Rome.
          Nicholas immediately sent two bishops to take possession of the
          Bulgarian territory for the Church, and answered the questions
          of Bogoris with much more painstaking seriousness than they
          deserved. Another embassy went to Louis the German to ask that
          Christian missionaries might be sent. In 867 Louis commissioned
          Bishop Ermanrich of Passau and a numerous retinue of priests to
          set out for the Danube. Charlemagne followed by raising a large
          sum to provide books and church utensils for the Bulgarians. But
          all this interest was thrown away. When Ermanrich reached
          Bulgaria, he found the field already occupied by priests from
          Rome, and returned to Germany. The communion with Rome lasted
          but a few years longer. Bogoris requested the appointment of
          Formosus of Porto (one of the two original Roman missionaries)
          as archbishop, and proposed another candidate when Nicholas
          declined; when this second nomination was rejected by Adrian II.
          he lost patience and turned to Constantinople. His envoys took
          part there in the final session of the Eighth Ecumenical Council
          (870), and after its close, in spite of the protests of the
          Roman legates, declared that Bulgaria belonged to the
          patriarchate of Constantinople. The Roman clergy were obliged to
          leave and the patriarch Ignatius organized the church by the
          consecration of a metropolitan and several bishops. Adrian II.
          protested (871), but in vain, and the efforts of John VIII. to
          reopen the question were equally fruitless; Bulgaria remained,
          as, indeed, its geographical situation demanded, a part of the
          Greek Church.

   Bulgaris, Eugenios
          BULGARIS, bul-g??´ris, EUGENIOS, ê´´u-gê´nî-es: Russian prelate;
          b. in the island of Corfu Aug. 10, 1716; d. at St. Petersburg
          June 10, 1806. He was educated at Padua, and taught in various
          schools and at the academy of Athos from 1755 to 1759. His
          orthodoxy being impugned, he went to the West, and was
          recommended by Frederick the Great to Catherine II. of Russia,
          who appointed him bishop of Slovensk and Kherson. In 1801 he
          retired to the monastery of Alexander Nevsky. Bulgaris was a
          very gifted and learned man, and contributed toward making
          Western culture accessible to his people. Together with Koraïs,
          he may be regarded as the founder of modern culture in Greece.
          He was an eclectic in philosophy, and was familiar with all
          branches of theology. Among his numerous works (in Greek),
          special mention may be made of his "Orthodox Confession"
          (Amsterdam, 1767), written against the Jesuit Leclerc, but also
          opposing the Protestants; and his "Address on Tolerance" (1768),
          denying the State the right of intolerance toward adherents of
          other creeds than that of the national church. His principal
          work was the "Dogmatic Theology" (ed. Lontopulos, Venice, 1872),
          the first real Greek treatise on dogmatics since the Middle
          Ages. It is divided into four parts, treating of God, the
          Trinity, anthropology, and Christology. Among his historical
          writings the most important was the "First Century from the
          Incarnation of Christ the Saviour" (Leipsic, 1805), while to the
          department of practical theology belongs the "Pious Talk" (2
          vols., 1801), a moralistic exposition of the Pentateuch. He also
          translated several writings of Augustine, and such works as the
          De processione Spiritus sancti of Zoernikau ( St. Petersburg,
          1797). He likewise edited the works of Joseph Bryennius, and
          assisted in the editing of the works of Theodoret (Halle, 1768).

          Mar. 25, 1634; d. at Brecon, Wales, Feb. 17, 1710. He studied at
          Oxford but did not take a degree; became minister of St.
          George's, near Bristol, 1655; rector of Suddington St. Mary's,
          near Cirencester, 1658, to which was joined the vicarage of the
          adjoining parish of St. Peter's 1662; rector of Avening,
          Gloucester, 1685. From 1678 to 1686 he was a prebendary of
          Gloucester; from 1686 to 1705 archdeacon of Llandaff. He became

    1. Conversion to Protestantism.

          Heinrich Bullinger was a Swiss Reformer; b. at Bremgarten (14¼
          m. e.s.e. of Aargau) July 18, 1504; d. at Zurich Sept. 17, 1575.
          He was the son of a priest, who looked after his bringing up.
          After receiving his elementary education in the schools of his
          native town, he was sent to Emmerich on the Lower Rhine to the
          Brethren of the Common Life, and in 1519 he went to Cologne.
          There, in the seat of opposition to the Reformation, Bullinger
          gradually became a convert to the new doctrines. When he began
          the study of theology, his text-books were the Sententiæ of
          Peter Lombard and the Decretum of Gratian, but noting that these
          were based on the Church Fathers, he resolved to study the
          latter more closely, thus learning from Chrysostom, Ambrose,
          Origen, and Augustine how widely the scholastics had diverged in
          their treatment of Christian truths. At the same time he came
          into possession of some pamphlets of Luther which convinced him
          that the Wittenberg Reformer marked an advance over the
          scholastics. Since, however, Luther like the Church Fathers,
          appealed to the Scriptures, Bullinger obtained a New Testament,
          which nourished his opposition to Roman doctrine. He was also
          strongly influenced by Melanchthon's Loci communes, and by 1522,
          despite a bitter inward struggle, he had broken definitely with
          the Roman Catholic Church. Being thus debarred from an
          ecclesiastical career, he resolved to become a teacher, and
          after nine months he secured a position in the Cistercian
          monastery at Kappel, where he remained from Jan., 1523, to
          Pentecost, 1529. Not only did he introduce his pupils to the
          classics, but he also interpreted a portion of the Bible to them
          daily, in addition to lecturing on other theological subjects in
          the presence of the abbot, the monks, and many of the residents
          of the city. Through his preaching of a reformation of doctrine
          and life the movement was completed in 1525-26, although
          Bullinger's life was imperiled by the hostility of the adherents
          of the ancient faith. In the early part of 1527 the monastery
          was transferred to the authorities of Zurich and the monastery
          church became the parish church of the community, with Bullinger
          as the preacher.

    2. Friendship with Zwingli.

          In close harmony with Zwingli, whom he had known since the end
          of 1523, and in consultation with Leo Jud, he began the active
          preparation of a large number of tracts designed to work for the
          Reformation in central Switzerland. After being invited by
          Zwingli in Jan., 1525, to attend a conference with the
          Anabaptists, he combated them, and in 1528 he accompanied
          Zwingli to the Disputation of Bern, where the leading Reformers
          of Switzerland and South Germany became acquainted with each
          other.

    3. The Successor of Zwingli.

          In June, 1529, Bullinger succeeded his father as pastor of
          Bremgarten, but his position was a perilous one, and the
          Reformed strongholds were fortified in expectation of the war
          between the Confederates, which threatened to break out in 1529.
          Despite the so-called "land-peace" and the sermons delivered by
          Bullinger at the diets held at Bremgarten in the summer of 1531,
          in which he urged upon his hearers the horrors of civil war and
          sought to reconcile the adherents of both creeds by the weapons
          of the spirit and the word of God without the effusion of blood,
          the Reformation had long been political rather than religious,
          and on Oct. 11, 1531, the battle of Kappel was fought, in which
          the leaders of the Zurich Reformation fell. The progress of the
          entire movement was checked and at Bremgarten at heavy cost a
          peace was made from which the clergy were excepted. In the night
          of Nov. 20 Bullinger fled to Zurich. The difficult task of the
          reconstruction of the Reformed Church and the maintenance of
          Zwingli's life-work now devolved upon him, and on Dec. 9, 1531,
          he was chosen pastor of the Grossmünster to succeed the great
          Swiss Reformer. At the same time, however, a controversy arose
          between the adherents of the ancient conditions, who advocated
          peace at any price, and the evangelical party, resulting in a
          decision to prohibit the clergy from touching on political
          questions in their sermons.

    4. Political Activity.

          After consultation with his colleagues, Bullinger declared
          himself ready to promote peace, but declined to refrain from
          political problems which were connected with religion. The
          liberty which he demanded was granted him after long
          deliberation, and the clergy accordingly placed themselves in
          opposition to the reactionaries. The sermons of Bullinger and
          Jud, however, resulted in their being cited before the council.
          They were honorably discharged, but were requested in future to
          lay their political complaints before the council on the chance
          that they might be settled without the necessity of publicity.
          Through this recognition of the spheres of Church and State as
          distinct but not opposed, Bullinger sustained a more healthy
          relation to the political body than Zwingli, and he also avoided
          the struggles made by Calvin to make the State subservient to
          the Church. A still more difficult task was the stemming of the
          Catholic reaction, and it was chiefly due to him that the
          disaster of Kappel had no worse results. The evangelical
          communities, however, suffered severely, and turned to Zurich
          for help, and the council, in their eagerness to refute the
          charge of Roman tendencies, unwisely inserted in their manifesto
          words which the Catholics claimed were an insult to the mass. In
          the controversy which ensued, Zurich was cited before the
          council of the Confederation, whereupon Bullinger, while blaming
          the city for its folly, advised the mutual surrender of the old
          letters of confederation, the peaceable division of the common
          territories, and the formation of a new union with such bodies
          as held to the word of God. Although it proved possible to
          preserve peace without this dissolution of the Confederation,
          the result was a partial humiliation of Zurich.

    5. Pastoral and Educational Activity.

          In the earlier years of his pastoral activity Bullinger was an
          indefatigable preacher, delivering between six and eight sermons
          each week, nor was it until 1542 that his labors were lessened
          to two addresses, on Sunday and Friday. Like Zwingli, he was
          accustomed to interpret entire books of the Bible in order, and
          his sermons were esteemed far and wide, especially in England.
          He was also active in education, and brought the schools of
          Zurich to a high standard of excellence, proposing an admirable
          scheme, which comprised both teachers and pupils and prescribed
          their duties. He likewise promoted theological training by the
          establishment of scholarships and secured the canons' fund for
          the maintenance of the schools, in addition to preparing
          regulations for preachers and synods. The first of these, drawn
          up by him and Leo Jud, remained unchanged for almost three
          centuries. The synod met twice annually, and had as
          representatives of the State a non-officiating burgomaster and
          eight members of the great council. The chief duty of the synod
          was a complete report of the activity, qualifications, and
          conduct of each and every pastor. Bullinger was highly esteemed
          as a pastor, especially in time of pestilence, while his Quo
          pacto cum ægrotantibus et morientibus agendum sit parænesis
          (1540) is a work of unusual excellence. A generous friend and
          patron of fugitives from Germany, Locarno, and England, he also
          wrote an enormous mass of letters, numbering among his
          correspondents Lady Jane Grey, Henry II. and Francis II. of
          France, Henry VIII. and Edward VI. of England, Elizabeth,
          Christian of Denmark, Philip of Hesse, and the palsgrave
          Frederick III.

    6. Eucharistic Teachings.

          Bullinger took part in the controversy over the Lord's Supper as
          the chief representative of German-Swiss doctrine. After the
          death of Zwingli both the Romanists, headed by Johann Faber, and
          Luther assailed the doctrines of his followers, only to be
          answered by Bullinger in his Auf Johannsen wienischen Bischofs
          Trostbüchlein tröstliche Verantwortung (Zurich, 1532) and in the
          introduction to Leo Jud's translation of the treatise De corpore
          et sanguine Domini of Ratramnus, a monk of Corvey. Even in these
          earlier works he emphasized the objective side of the sacrament,
          the work of Christ in the faithful, whereas Zwingli had taught
          rather the subjective aspect as a memorial. The controversy
          involved the Protestant party in Germany, and in the ensuing
          efforts for reconciliation Butzer and Bullinger were active
          figures, the latter preparing a confession for the former,
          showing how far a union with Luther was possible. This
          confession was sent in Nov., 1534, to the remaining Swiss cities
          and was gladly accepted by the majority, Bern alone refusing to
          subscribe to it until after the Conference of Brugg in Apr.,
          1535. This was, however, little more than an agreement of the
          clergy, and the desirability of an understanding with Luther, as
          well as the expectation of a general council, rendered it
          advisable for the Swiss Church to make an official formulation
          of its creed.

    7. The Helvetic and Zurich Confessions and the Consensus Tigurinus.

          The result was the First Helvetic Confession (see [584]Helvetic
          Confessions), framed at Basel in 1536, Bullinger being one of
          its authors. Meanwhile Butzer had framed the [585]Wittenberg
          Concord, which was accepted by the cities of Upper Germany, but
          was opposed by Bullinger in Zurich and rejected by Bern. The
          Swiss responded with an elucidation of the Helvetic Confession
          prepared by Bullinger and addressed directly to Luther (Nov.,
          1536), seeking the middle way between transubstantiation and the
          concept of a mere memorial meal. The reply was conciliatory, but
          the peace was soon broken by Luther, who bitterly attacked the
          Zwinglian doctrines of the Lord's Supper in 1544. Bullinger
          replied in the Zurich Confession of 1545, and, though no
          understanding was reached between the Swiss and the Lutheran
          churches, the French and German sections of the Swiss Church
          were drawn together all the closer, a matter which was the more
          momentous since the Reformed had found a second center in
          Geneva, thus giving rise to the danger of a schism like that
          headed by Luther and Melanchthon in Germany. The peril was
          averted, however, by the Consensus Tigurinus, which was quietly
          prepared by Bullinger and Calvin in 1549 and which was in
          complete harmony with the previous views of Bullinger on the
          Lord's Supper, while it emphasized the divine work of grace,
          though it restricted it to the elect. In his later years he was
          involved in a controversy with Brenz, who defended the doctrine
          of the ubiquity of the sacraments but reached no definite
          conclusion. The views concerning the Lord's Supper were closely
          connected with the doctrine of predestination.

    8. His Part in the Second Helvetic Confession.

          While still in Kappel, Bullinger had maintained that free will
          was incompatible with the foreknowledge of God, but later he was
          gradually led to accept the Calvinistic doctrine of
          predestination, his views finding their ultimate expression in
          the famous Second Helvetic Confession, which he prepared in
          consultation with his friend Peter Martyr to serve as a
          posthumous testimony of his own belief and that of his church.
          It was published, however, in 1566, when Frederic III., who was
          accused of Calvinism, wished to defend himself before the Diet
          of Augsburg. At his request Bullinger sent him the confession,
          which he printed and which was accepted not only by all Swiss
          churches with the exception of Basel, but also by the Reformed
          in France, Scotland, and Hungary and highly praised in Germany,
          England, and Holland. It was, strictly speaking, the bond
          uniting the scattered members of the Evangelical-Reformed
          churches.

    9. Views on the Relation of Church and State.

          In the controversies concerning the relation of Church and
          State, Bullinger regarded the two as united, Christian citizens
          forming both Church and State, and temporal officials being
          likewise the servants of God. The chief duty of the Church was
          the unrestricted preaching of the word, and the power of
          admonishing the authorities, when necessary, of their
          obligations. Neither Church nor State, however, should interfere
          in each other's affairs. External administration of the property
          of the Church, on the other hand, was to be left to the State,
          which was also to execute ecclesiastical punishments. With this
          was closely connected his attitude toward heretics. While in his
          earlier career he had expressed the utmost tolerance, he later
          reached the conclusion that preaching and writing against heresy
          must be supplemented by state punishment. Roused by Anabaptism,
          he urged in 1535 that no heretics should be admitted to the city
          and that, if all efforts at conversion proved fruitless, they
          should be punished by the secular arm, though with due
          consideration of the circumstances of each individual case. This
          position did not exclude capital punishment, and while Bullinger
          did not avail himself of it in the case of the Anabaptists, it
          is easy to see how he could counsel the execution of Servetus
          and the exile of Ochino.

          The years 1564-65 were marked with sorrow for Bullinger, who
          lost many of his relatives and closest friends by death, and was
          himself so seriously ill with the plague that his life was
          despaired of. Even after his apparent recovery his health was
          shattered, and his sufferings from calculi increased until he
          was repeatedly near death. His last sermon was delivered on
          Whitsuntide, 1575, and four months later he died.

    10. The Works of Bullinger.

          Bullinger's works are extraordinarily numerous but have never
          been published in collected form and some are extant only in
          manuscript. The catalogue of the municipal library of Zurich
          lists about 100 separate works, and this number is raised to 150
          by J. J. Scheuchzer. Especially noteworthy are his Latin
          expositions of all the books of the New Testament with the
          exception of the Apocalypse, which were prepared up to 1548,
          when their place was taken by collections of sermons, the
          majority also in Latin, comprising 100 on the Apocalypse,
          sixty-six on Daniel, 170 on Jeremiah, and 190 on Isaiah. His
          sermons on the decalogue, the Apostles' Creed, the sacraments,
          etc., were highly esteemed and published under the title,
          Sermonum decades quinque (Zurich, 1557; translated into Dutch
          and French; Eng. transl., The Decades, London, 1577, ed. for the
          Parker Society by T. Harding, Cambridge, 1849-1851). Among his
          theological works special mention may be made of his De
          providentia (Zurich, 1553); De gratia Dei justificante, and De
          scripturæ sanctæ auctoritate et certitudine deque episcoporum
          institutione et functione (1538, Eng, transl., Woorthynesse,
          authoritie, and sufficiencie of the holy Scripture, London,
          1579). He was likewise the author of a drama on Lucretia and
          Brutus and of a hymn beginning: "O holy God, have mercy now!"
          Bullinger also wrote a chronicle and description of Kappel, and
          later prepared a similar work entitled Antiquitates aliquot
          ecclesiæ Tigurinæ, which is preserved in manuscript in the
          municipal library. An important source for the history of the
          Anabaptists is found in his Der Wiedertaüfern Ursprung, fürgang,
          Sekten (Zurich, 1560), but his chief historical work was his
          detailed chronicle of the Swiss, the most valuable part being
          the history of the Reformation up to 1532 (ed. J. J. Hottinger
          and H. H. Vögeli, 6 vols., Frauenfeld, 1838-40).

   Bunbury, Thomas
          BUNBURY, THOMAS: Protestant bishop of Limerick; b. at Shandrum,
          County Cork, 1832. He was educated at Trinity College, Dublin
          (B.A., 1852), ordered deacon 1854, and priest the following
          year. He was curate of Clonfert, County Galway (1855-58), and of
          Mallow, County Cork (1858-1863), rector of Croom, County
          Limerick (1863-72), rector of St. Mary's, Limerick, and dean of
          Limerick (1872-99). From 1895 to 1899 he was also chaplain to
          the bishop of Limerick, and in the latter year was himself
          consecrated to that see. Died at Shandrum Jan. 19, 1907.

   Bund, Evangelischer
          BUND, EVANGELISCHER ("Evangelical Union"): An alliance of German
          Protestants for maintaining Protestant interests in Germany. The
          occasion of the formation was the modern aggressions of the
          papacy (leading to the Kulturkampf) and the arrogance of
          Ultramontanism, the dream of which is to reestablish Catholicism
          in Germany. Its founder was Prof. W. Beyschlag of Halle who,
          finding others interested in the scheme, called a preliminary
          meeting at Erfurt, October 5, 1886, which was attended by
          seventy men representing different types of Protestant theology.
          After a thorough discussion, an organization was effected under
          the presidency of Count von Wintzingerode-Bodenstein. The
          confessional basis of the alliance is: "Belief in Jesus Christ,
          the only begotten Son of God, as the only mediator of salvation,
          and adherence to the principles of the Reformation." In the
          beginning of the year 1887 a circular containing 243 names was
          sent out, and when the alliance held its first annual meeting in
          Frankfort, August 15-17, 1887, 10,000 members were reported. The
          ecclesiastical authorities, who were at first indifferent, soon
          perceived the great importance of the Bund and expressed their
          approval of the purposes of the alliance, which in various ways
          has developed a great activity in opposition to the Roman
          propaganda. In public lectures the burning religious questions
          of the day are treated with the intention of sharpening and
          strengthening the Protestant consciousness. As the Bund has its
          own publication house at Leipsic, it publishes not only a
          monthly in behalf of Protestant interests, but also pamphlets
          intended to expose and to refute the claims of Ultramontanism
          and to repel attacks, especially directed against the memory and
          work of Luther and Gustavus Adolphus. The Bund has also the
          practical end of affording material help to weak institutions in
          the "Diaspora." The effect of the Bund is felt by the
          Ultramontanes, and their attacks upon it only show its
          necessity.

          BUNGENER, bün´´je-nê´ (LAURENT LOUIS), FÉLIX: Swiss Protestant;
          b. at Marseilles Sept. 14, 1814; d. in Geneva June 14, 1874. He
          was graduated B.L. at Marseilles, 1832, B.S. at Geneva, 1834,
          studied theology at Geneva and was graduated at Strasburg, 1838;
          ordained in Geneva, 1839, and lived there as teacher, writer,
          and occasional preacher. His books and articles were very
          numerous and exerted a wide influence, especially those of a
          controversial character against the Church of Rome. From 1849
          till his death he was one of the editors of Étrennes
          religieuses, an annual chronicle of religious events,
          particularly those connected with Geneva. His more noteworthy
          books were: Un sermon sous Louis XIV (Paris, 1843; Eng. transl.,

   Bunsen, Christian Karl Josias
          BUNSEN, bun´zen, CHRISTIAN KARL JOSIAS: Baron; German scholar
          and diplomat; b. at Korbach (28 m. s.w. of Cassel) Aug. 25,
          1791; d. at Bonn Nov. 28, 1860. He studied theology and
          philology in Marburg and Göttingen (1808-13). Resigning his
          hopes of journeying to India, Bunsen followed his friend Brandis
          to Rome in 1816, first as secretary to the Russian embassy, over
          which Niebuhr presided. Two years later he succeeded Brandis in
          the diplomatic service, and represented Prussia at Rome (where
          he became a close friend of Tholuck and Rothe) from 1823 to
          1839. In the latter year he was sent as minister to Bern, and in
          1841 to London as minister plenipotentiary and envoy
          extraordinary of his Majesty Frederick William IV. at the Court
          of St. James. In 1854 he returned to Germany and was ennobled by
          the king of Prussia. In the same year he retired to Heidelberg,
          devoting himself to literary pursuits. Shortly before his death
          he moved to Bonn, where he continued his studies until the last.
          Bunsen's influence and position enabled him to assist not only
          scholars like Birch, Cureton, Max Müller, Richard Lepsius, and
          Hoffmann, but also to found institutions, like the German
          hospitals in Rome and London, and the archeological institute at
          Rome. He helped to establish the Anglo-Prussian bishopric at
          Jerusalem (see [586]Jerusalem, Anglican-German Bishopric in) as
          a basis of a larger union between the German evangelical and the
          Anglican churches. A complete list of his writings would include
          contributions to Roman and Egyptian Antiquities, as well as to
          politics, liturgy, and hymnology. His chief works of theological
          interest are as follows: Ignatius von Antiochien und seine Zeit
          (Hamburg, 1847); Hippolytus and his Age (4 vols., London, 1851),
          which, together with his Analecta Ante-Nicæna and Outlines of
          the Philosophy of Universal History as Applied to Language and
          Religion, form his great work Christianity and Mankind (7 vols.,
          1854), for which many scholars wrote contributions. Soon after
          his return to Germany he published Die Zeichen der Zeit (2
          vols., Leipsic, 1855; Eng. transl., Signs of the Times, London,
          1856), in which he assailed the anarchy existing in political,
          religious, and intellectual life, advocating toleration and
          liberty of conscience, and opposing the sophistical and
          fanatical doctrines of Stahl and Ketteler. Another work which
          involved Bunsen in controversy was his Gott in der Geschichte,
          oder der Fortschritt des Glaubens an eine sittliche Weltordnung
          (3 vols., 1857-58; Eng. transl., God in History, 3 vols.,
          London, 1868-70), but his most important book was his
          Vollständiges Bibelwerk für die Gemeinde (9 vols., 1858-70).
          Bunsen lived to see the publication of vols. i., ii., and v.;
          after his death Adolf Kamphausen, continued the work with the
          help of Johannes Bleak, H. Holtzmann, and others; the work gave
          a marked impetus to the revision of Luther's Bible version, and
          was diligently consulted by the German revisers.

   Bunting, Jabez
          BUNTING, JABEZ: The "second founder of Methodism"; b. at
          Manchester May 13, 1779; d. in London June 16, 1858. He received
          a good school education in Manchester, and began to preach at
          the age of nineteen; was stationed first in Manchester, then at
          Macclesfield (1801), London (1803), Manchester (1805), Sheffield
          (1807), Liverpool (1809); Halifax (1811), Leeds (1813), London
          (1815), Manchester (1824), Liverpool (1830); from 1833 he lived
          in London and filled the most important positions at the
          denominational headquarters. He was one of the founders of the
          Wesleyan Missionary Society and its secretary for eighteen
          years; was first president of the Wesleyan Missionary Institute
          in London, from 1835 till his death; was president of the
          conference in 1820, 1828, 1836, and 1844. He perfected the
          Methodist organization, and it was his influence which gave
          steadily increasing powers to laymen. He edited the seventh
          edition of Cruden's Concordance (Liverpool, 1815) and Memoirs of
          the Early Life of William Cowper (1816). Two volumes of sermons,
          edited by his eldest son, W. M. Bunting, appeared posthumously
          (1861-62).

   Bunyan, John
          BUNYAN, JOHN: "The immortal dreamer of Bedford jail;" b. at
          Harrowden (1 m. s.e. of Bedford), in the parish of Elstow,
          christened Nov. 30, 1628; d. in London Aug. 31, 1688. He had
          very little schooling, followed his father in the tinker's
          trade, was in the parliamentary army, 1644-47; married in 1649;
          lived in Elstow till 1655, when his wife died and he moved to
          Bedford. He married again 1659. He was received into the Baptist
          church in Bedford by immersion in the Ouse, 1653. In 1655 he
          became a deacon and began preaching with marked success from the
          start. In 1658 he was indicted for preaching without a license;
          kept on, however, and did not suffer imprisonment till Nov.,
          1660, when he was taken to the county jail in Silver Street,
          Bedford, and there confined, with the exception of a few weeks
          in 1666, till Jan., 1672. In that month he became pastor of the
          Bedford church. In March, 1675 (the original warrant, discovered
          in 1887, is published in facsimile by Rush and Warwick, London),
          he was again imprisoned for preaching and this time in the
          Bedford town jail on the stone bridge over the Ouse. In six
          months he was free and was not again molested. In Aug., 1688, on
          his way to London he caught a severe cold from being wet, and
          died at the house of a friend on Snow Hill.

          All the world knows that Bunyan wrote The Pilgrim's Progress, in
          two parts, of which the first appeared at London in 1678, and
          was at all events, begun during his imprisonment in 1676; the
          second in 1684. The earliest edition in which the two parts were
          combined in one volume was in 1728. A third part falsely
          attributed to Bunyan appeared in 1693, and was reprinted as late
          as 1852. The Pilgrim's Progress is the most successful allegory
          ever written, and like the Bible is adapted to man in every
          clime. It is indeed commonly translated by Protestant
          missionaries after the Bible. It is thus read in all literary
          languages and is a world-classic. Two other works of Bunyan's
          would have given him fame, but not as wide as that he now
          enjoys; viz., The Life and Death of Mr. Badman (1680), an
          imaginary biography, and the allegory The Holy War (1682). The
          book which lays bare Bunyan's inner life and reveals his
          preparation for his appointed work is Grace Abounding to the
          chief of sinners (1666). It is very prolix, and being all about
          himself, in a man less holy would be intolerably egotistic, but
          his motive in writing being plainly to exalt the grace of God
          and to comfort those passing through experiences somewhat like
          his own, his egotism makes no disagreeable impression.

          The works just named have appeared in numerous editions, and are
          accessible to all. There are several noteworthy collections of
          editions of the Pilgrim's Progress, e.g., in the British Museum,
          and in the New York Public Library, collected by the late James
          Lenox.

          Bunyan was a popular preacher as well as a very voluminous
          author, though most of his works consist of expanded sermons. In
          theology he was a Puritan, but not a partizan; nor was there
          anything gloomy about him. The portrait which his friend Robert
          White drew, which has been often reproduced, is a most
          attractive one and this was his true character. He was tall, had
          reddish hair, prominent nose, a rather large mouth, and
          sparkling eyes. He was no scholar, except of the English Bible,
          but that he knew thoroughly. Another book which greatly
          influenced him was Martin Luther's Commentary on the Epistle to
          the Galatians, in the translation of 1575.

          [Some time before his final release from prison Bunyan became
          involved in a controversy with Kiffin, d'Anvers, Deune, Paul,
          and others. In 1673 he published his Differences in Judgement
          about Water-Baptism no Bar to Communion, in which he took the
          ground that "the Church of Christ hath not warrant to keep out
          of the communion the Christian that is discovered to be a
          visible saint of the word, the Christian that walketh according
          to his own light with God." While he owned "water baptism to be
          God's ordinance," he refused to make "an idol of it," as he
          thought those did who made the lack of it a ground for
          disfellowshiping those recognized as genuine Christians. Kiffin
          and Paul published a rejoinder in Serious Reflections (London,
          1673), in which they ably set forth the argument in favor of the
          restriction of the Lord's Supper to baptized believers, and
          received the approval of Henry d'Anvers in his Treatise of
          Baptism (London, 1674). The result of the controversy was to
          leave the question of communion with the unbaptized an open one
          so far as the Particular (Calvinistic) Baptists were concerned.
          Bunyan's church admitted pedobaptists to fellowship and finally
          became pedobaptist (Congregationalist).

   Burchard of Worms
          BURCHARD OF WORMS: Bishop of Worms; d. Aug. 20, 1025. He was a
          Hessian by birth, and was educated at Coblenz and under the
          famous Olbert in the Flemish monastery of Laubach. Willigis of
          Mainz ordained him, and employed him in a number of important
          affairs. Otto III. gave him the bishopric of Worms (1000), which
          had fallen into a bad condition. He improved the city in many
          ways; established the episcopal power more firmly and even
          increased it; demolished the fortress of Duke Otto and built a
          monastery with the stones from it, placing over the door the
          inscription Ob libertatem civitatis. In 1014 Henry II. gave him
          secular jurisdiction over the inhabitants, which he used to
          promote uniformity and security of law. He rebuilt the
          cathedral, consecrating it in 1016; but his fame rests chiefly
          on his collection of canon law, which had a very wide
          circulation not only in Germany but in Italy.

   Burchard of Würzburg
          BURCHARD OF WÜRZBURG: Bishop of Würzburg 741-754. He was an
          Anglo-Saxon who left England after the death of his kinsfolk and
          joined Boniface in his missionary labors, some time after 732.
          When Boniface organized bishoprics in Middle Germany, he placed
          Burchard over that of Würzburg; his consecration can not have
          occurred later than the summer of 741, since in the autumn of
          that year, we find him officiating as a bishop at the
          consecration of Willibald of Eichstädt. Pope Zacharias confirmed
          the new bishopric in 743. Burchard appears again as a member of
          the first German council in 742, and as an envoy to Rome from
          Boniface in 748. With Fulrad of Saint-Denis, he brought to
          Zacharias the famous question of Pepin, whose answer was
          supposed to justify the assumption of regal power by the
          Merovingians.

          began preaching under the influence of Whitefield and his
          associates; became minister at Lancaster, 1778; Coventry, 1783;
          Fetter Lane, London, 1803. He was one of the founders of the
          London Missionary Society (1795), of the Religion Tract Society
          (1799), and of the British and Foreign Bible Society (1804), and
          from 1803 to 1827 served gratuitously as secretary of the
          first-named, besides editing The Evangelical Magazine for many
          years. The moat successful of his many publications were Village
          Sermons (7 vols., London, 1798-1816), and A Collection of Hymns,
          Intended as a Supplement to Watts (1784), which went through
          some fifty editions and contained three or four hymns of his
          own.

   Burger, Karl Heinrich August von
          BURGER, KARL HEINRICH AUGUST VON: German theologian; b. at
          Baireuth (126 m. n. of Munich) May 1, 1805; d. at Schönau (a
          village near Berchtesgaden, 12 m. s. of Salzburg) July 14, 1885.
          He studied theology and philology at the University of Erlangen
          (1823-27), and in 1827 was appointed teacher at the gymnasium
          there. Eleven years later be became curate at Fürth near
          Nuremberg, and in 1846 he was transferred in the same capacity
          to Munich, where he was appointed dean in 1849 and councilor of
          the high consistory in 1855, holding this office until his
          resignation in 1883. Under the guidance of his father-in-law,
          Johann Christian Krafft, of Erlangen, he gained a thorough
          knowledge of the Bible which was evinced by his Die Briefe Pauli
          an die Korinther (2 vols., Erlangen, 1859-60); Die Evangelien
          nach Matthæus, Marcus und Lucas (Nördlingen, 1865); Das
          Evangelium nach Johannes (1868); and Die Offenbarung St.
          Johannis (Munich, 1877). Interpreting the Bible by the Bible, he
          sought to render his work available for the educated laity,
          while clergymen also find it valuable in the preparation of
          sermons. His interpretation of Revelation has met with special
          favor in Württemberg. While his sermons were not couched in
          popular style, and while they demanded close attention on
          account of their logic and depth, they appealed effectually to
          serious auditors, and two collections of them were published,
          Predigten in der protestantischen Stadtpfarrkirche zu München
          gehalten (Erlangen, 1857) and Predigten für alle Sonn- und
          Festtage des Kirchenjahres (2 vols., Nördlingen, 1864). As a
          member of the high consistory, Burger aided the Bavarian Church
          to surmount rationalism and to become a true evangelical
          Lutheran body, and his task was facilitated by his thorough
          knowledge of philosophy, history, and theology, as well as by
          his tact and discretion. Despite his reserved and quiet nature,
          which shunned all publicity, he enjoyed the deep esteem and
          gratitude of the clergy and their congregations, as well as the
          confidence of the three kings of Bavaria under whom he served,
          Louis I., Maximilian II., and Louis II.

   Burges, Cornelius
          BURGES, bUr´jes, CORNELIUS: Presbyterian; b. in Somersetshire
          (date undetermined, probably 1589); d. at Watford (7 m. s.w. of
          St. Albans), buried there June 9, 1665. He was educated at
          Oxford in Wadham and other colleges; was vicar of Watford
          (1613-45), also (1626-41) rector of St. Magnus Church in London,
          holding the two charges at the same time. On the accession of
          Charles I. (1625), he was appointed one of the chaplains in
          ordinary. He was appointed a member of the Westminster Assembly
          in 1643. July 8 he was chosen by them assessor with Dr. White,
          and generally occupied the chair on account of the illness of
          Dr. Twisse. He was chairman of the first of the three grand
          committees of the Assembly, and one of the most energetic
          members of the body, being active especially in the discussion
          of Church Government and the Directory for Worship. He was
          energetic in political as well as ecclesiastical affairs. On the
          Restoration his handsome property was confiscated, and he died
          in want. His chief works are: A Chain of Graces Drawn out at
          Length for Reformation of Manners (London, 1622); The Fire of
          the Sanctuary newly Discovered or a Compleat Tract of Zeal
          (1625); and Baptismal Regeneration of Elect Infants (Oxford,
          1629). In the latter he maintains: "It is most agreeable to the
          Institution of Christ that all elect infants that are baptized
          (unless in some extraordinary cases doe, ordinarily, receive,
          from Christ, the Spirit in Baptism, for their first solemn
          initiation into Christ, and for their future actual renovation,
          in God's good time, if they live to yeares of discretion, and
          enjoy the ordinary means of grace appointed of God to this end."
          He delivered a large number of sermons before Parliament and
          other civil bodies, which were published from time to time. He
          is credited also with the paper subscribed by the London
          ministers, entitled A Vindication of the ministers of the Gospel
          in and about London from the unjust Aspersions cast upon their
          former Actings for the Parliament, as if they had promoted the
          Bringing of the King to Capital Punishment, London, 1648.

          He studied at Magdalen Hall, Oxford, but would not conform and
          so did not graduate; went to Ireland in 1667 with Roger Boyle,
          earl of Orrery, and became master of a school founded by his
          patron at Charleville, County Cork; was ordained by the Dublin

          influential friends and preached to a large congregation
          attracted by his lively and witty style. Besides preaching he
          took pupils and was tutor to Henry St. John (Lord Bolingbroke).

   Burgundians
          BURGUNDIANS: A Germanic race, akin to the Goths and Vandals,
          whose earliest known home was on the Baltic between the Oder and
          the Vistula. In the middle of the second century they had begun
          to move southward; in the middle of the third they were driven
          further to the southwest, and occupied what is now Franconia,
          north and east of Lyons. With their neighbors on the southwest,
          the Alemanni, they had many conflicts, and summoned the aid of
          the Romans; they are found cooperating on the Rhine with
          Valentinian I. against them in 370. Next they occupied the right
          bank of the river, and the Vandal invasion of Gaul in the fifth
          century carried them across with it, to receive an allotment of
          land in Germania prima, a province of Gaul, in 413, and become
          subject to the empire. By this time they had adopted the
          religion of their Roman neighbors, probably almost in a body.
          Peaceful relations with the Romans did not last long, however.
          In 435 King Gundicar attacked the first Belgian province, but
          was driven back by Aëtius. A year later they were again defeated
          by the Huns, acting with the Romans, and lost their king and
          much of their power. But they must have recovered before many
          years, for in 457, with the consent of the West-Goths, they
          occupied the province Lugdunensis prima; in the following decade
          they extended their rule over the Provincia Viennensis; and
          about 472 they added the greater part of the Maxima Sequanorum.
          After Gundicar's death, his sons Gunduic and Chilperic I. shared
          the kingship, and the latter reigned alone after his brother's
          death. Gunduic's son, Gundobad, succeeded Chilperic; he had
          three brothers, Godegisel, Chilperic II., and Godomar. Godegisel
          appears as a partaker of his sovereignty; Chilperic was said to
          have been put to death by his order, but this is not certain, as
          Avitus speaks of Chilperic's death and Godomar's (which happened
          early in his reign) as a great blow to him. Gundobad was
          succeeded by his son Sigismund, who was captured by the Frankish
          kings in 523 and put to death in the next year. His brother
          Godomar II. maintained himself against the Franks for ten years;
          but he also succumbed, and in 534 the Burgundian territory
          became part of the Frankish kingdom.

          The religious development of the Burgundians during the progress
          of these events is peculiar. They had come from the Rhine to the
          Rhone as Catholic Christians; but most of them joined the Arians
          in their new home. The royal house seems to have been slow to
          change; Gunduic and Chilperic II. were Catholics; but Gregory of
          Tours mentions Gundobad, with his brother Godegisel, as Arians.
          The change to Arianism seems to have followed from the feudal
          relations of the Burgundians to their more powerful West-Gothic
          neighbors. Gundobad was not a persecutor, though some churches
          were taken from the Catholics; Avitus of Vienne seems even to
          have had hopes of his conversion. But, though the bishop failed
          with the father, he succeeded with the son; Sigismund returned
          to the Church in his father's lifetime, followed by many of the
          people. But not until Gundobad's death did the decisive movement
          away from Arianism occur. Sigismund's son Sigeric followed his
          father's example, and Godomar had become a Catholic even
          earlier. In 517 a synod was held at Epao, the present Albo,
          south of Vienne (see [589]Epao, Synod of), the decrees of which
          plainly show that Arianism was no longer dangerous, and that the
          time for its total suppression was believed to have come.
          Certainly it disappeared from that time, though no exact date
          can be assigned. By the union with the Frankish kingdom, the
          Burgundian Church lost its independence and became merely a part
          of the Frankish ecclesiastical organization.

  I. Hebrew.

          In all periods interment was the customary Hebrew method of
          disposing of the dead. I Sam. xxxi. 12 and Amos vi. 10, in spite
          of the corrupt condition of the text, show that burning was
          exceptional; indeed, incineration implied something
          discreditable to the dead and in ancient custom and the
          priest-code was an intensification of the death-penalty (Josh.
          vii. 25; Lev. xx. 14). Aversion to incineration accompanied
          ancient belief in the existence of a bond between soul and body
          even after death. The spirits of the unburied dead wandered
          restless on the earth, and in Sheol their lot was pitiable,
          driven as they were into nooks and corners (Ezek. xxii. 23). The
          grave confined the soul to the body so as to give it repose and
          save it from injury. Consequently it was not merely an awful
          disgrace but a terrible misfortune not to be buried (I Kings
          xiv. 11; (II Kings ix. 10; Isa. xxxiii. 12). Hence it was a
          sacred duty to inter a body found unburied. In the case of
          criminals stoned to death a heap of stones over the body served
          as a grave (Josh. vii. 26).

    1. Preparation for Burial.

          The climate of Palestine necessitated the quickest possible
          disposition of the corpse; interment, therefore, took place on
          the day of death (Deut. xxi. 23). In the time of Christ the body
          was washed, anointed with fragrant spices, and more or less
          completely wrapped in linen (Acts. ix. 37; Mark xvi. 1; John xi.
          44). The Old Testament makes no allusion to this custom. The
          belief that the dead in Sheol might be recognized by the habit
          implies that in early times the corpse was buried in the apparel
          of daily life. Later, royalty and officials were buried with
          costly spices, ornaments, gold, and silver (Josephus, Ant.,
          XIII. viii. 4; XV. iii. 4). And if the account by Josephus of
          the plundering of David's tomb by Hyrcanus and Herod may be
          trusted, this custom reached back into antiquity. Embalming was
          a custom foreign to the Hebrews; cases of it are Jacob and
          Joseph (Gen. l. 2, 26) and Aristobulus (Josephus, Ant., XIV.
          vii. 4). The use of coffins was post-exilic.

    2. Place.

          The place of burial was determined by the belief that the ties
          of kinship lasted beyond death. The value of a family
          burying-place was in part due to the fact that burial therein
          involved union with kin in Sheol (Gen. xxv. 8, 17; II Sam. xxi.
          14). Therefore, family tombs were in the earliest ages on the
          estate and near the house (I Sam. xxv. 1). Therein might be laid
          only members of the family. A public cemetery was provided for
          the very poor, for foreigners, and for criminals (Jer. xxvi. 23;
          Isa. liii. 9; Matt. xxvii. 7). The kings of Judah had tombs in
          Jerusalem, and Ezekiel charges them with the serious offense of
          laying their dead next to the precincts of the sanctuary. To
          miss burial with one's kin was dire misfortune or divine
          punishment. For practical reasons people began quite early to
          locate tombs outside the cities, and graves came to be regarded
          as ceremonially impure. In the time of Christ tombs were
          whitewashed in order that their character might be known at a
          distance and defilement avoided (Matt. xxiii. 27; Luke xi. 44).

          The grave was simple in its appointments. Wherever in Jewish
          tombs rich ornamentation is found, foreign influence (generally
          Greek) is recognized. Apart from the general lack of artistic
          sense displayed by the Hebrews, a religious consideration comes
          in to explain this: the stern opposition of the Yahweh-cult to
          ancestor-worship discouraged adornment of burial-places, which
          thus differed widely from Egyptian and Phenician tombs. This and
          the lack of inscriptions make it difficult to determine the date
          of Jewish graves. For situation, rocky chambers, natural or
          artificial, were preferred.

    3. Varieties of Graves.

          Four kinds of graves are known: (1) recess-graves, oblong,
          rock-hewn, about six feet long by one and a half square, hewn
          lengthwise into the wall of the chamber, into which the body was
          placed from the end; (2) sunken-graves, like those used in the
          Occident, but covered with stone; (3) bench-graves, set
          bench-like in the walls of the chamber, twenty-two inches high,
          often arch-roofed and hewn sidewise into the chamber-wall; (4)
          trough-graves, a combination of (2) and (3) above. Of the
          chambers there are three varieties: (1) single chambers with a
          single sunken grave in the floor; (2) single chambers with
          several graves of one or more of the above-mentioned kinds; (3)
          larger burial-places with more than one chamber. All of the
          third variety so far found belong to a late date, as is proved
          by the architecture. The oldest and commonest are of the second
          type, single chambers with recess-graves, which are so typical
          that they may be named specifically Hebrew. Such allow the
          largest number of interments in a given chamber. Shaft-tombs of
          the Egyptian pattern have so far not been discovered in
          Palestine.

          The Phenician custom of marking an excavated grave by a
          grave-stone other than the stone-heap piled on it was not
          adopted by the Hebrews. The tombs built above ground date from
          the Greek period, or later, and are of foreign origin.

  II. Christian:

    1. Early Practise and Ceremonies.

          From the beginning the Christians regarded the final disposal of
          the dead as a congregational matter, and, when possible, they
          had burial-places, in which only those who were their members
          might be buried and which were called cæmeteria
          ("resting-places"), in allusion to the resurrection (see
          [590]Cemeteries). In deference to the body as the organ of the
          spirit and in the expectation of the resurrection, they were
          careful that the funeral should take place in a proper manner.
          The corpse was carried to the grave by bearers whom the
          Christian congregation had appointed, and the fact that the
          funeral took place, if possible, in day-time, was designed to
          express joy and hope that the departed had been set free and had
          entered into eternal life. The pagan lamentation for the dead,
          as well as the crowning of the corpse, was not approved, but
          torches were carried in front, as befitting the victorious
          combatant, and hymns and psalms were sung, in praise of God. A
          memorial address was doubtless made on special occasions, but a
          funeral sermon in the modern sense seems to have been unknown.
          Prayers were offered at the grave, and the survivors gave food
          and money to the poor. Prayers were made for the deceased, not
          only in private, but also in public. The third, seventh (or
          ninth), thirtieth (or fortieth) day were memorial days, on which
          the church ceremony for the dead took place, as well as on the
          anniversary of death (see [591]Cemeteries, II., 6). These
          prayers and offerings were believed to have a beneficial effect
          for the dead, provided he belonged to the saved.

    2. The Greek Church.

          The Greek Church preserves a remnant of the idea that the death
          of a Christian invites to praise, and on this account uses the
          Hallelujah in the celebration at the church. The requiem-mass is
          unknown, but additional prayers are offered for the dead. The
          ceremony at the grave is very brief, the priest throwing earth
          upon the corpse with the spade and sprinkling it with oil from
          the holy lamp or ashes from the censer.

    3. The Medieval Church.

          The Western Church of the Middle Ages also knew only of burial
          as a means of disposal of the dead. Charlemagne forbade the
          conquered Saxons to cremate corpses on pain of death. The place
          in which a Christian was buried was considered holy ground, but
          patrons or spiritual dignitaries were entombed in churches in
          token of distinction. Every Christian was to be buried in
          consecrated ground, but if special emergencies, like war or
          shipwreck, necessitated a burial in unconsecrated ground, the
          grave had to be provided with a cross. The dead was washed,
          dressed in linen or penitential robes, or, in case of one in
          holy orders, in official dress. On the day of the funeral he was
          carried by his peers, the layman by laymen, and the clergy by
          clergy, first to the church, where mass was celebrated, and
          afterward to the grave, in which he was laid, with his face
          turned toward the East. Various ceremonies had their meaning;
          the holy water sprinkled on the body protected it from demons;
          charcoal indicated that there was a grave there and thus kept it
          from profanation; incense kept away the odor of decay, and was a
          symbol of prayer for the dead, as implying that he was a
          sacrifice well pleasing to God; ivy and laurel symbolized the
          imperishable life of those who die in Christ. The custom of
          throwing three shovelfuls of earth upon the body was known in
          the Middle Ages, although the present Roman ritual does not
          mention it. The modern Roman Catholic Church has retained the
          old Christian view that the death of little children who have
          been baptized is a joyful event and that their burial should
          have the character of joy.

    4. The Reformation Burial Service.

          The Reformation made a clean sweep of the existing burial rites,
          in so far as they presupposed the doctrines of purgatory, mass,
          and the mediation of the Church, but it adhered to the view that
          the dead body is not a worthless thing but is to rise again, no
          matter how it has decayed. On this account it should have a
          Christian burial, and the burial-places must have a fitting
          appearance. The burial was a matter of the church, and the
          congregation should take part in it, if possible, and should
          also attend the funerals of the poor. Accordingly, the bells
          called the congregation together. The church was represented by
          the minister and the school-children, or at least by the sexton
          and grave-digger. As the procession was passing to the cemetery,
          the children or the mourners sang Christian funeral hymns, and
          at the grave such Biblical passages as I Thess. iv. 13-18 or
          John xi. were read and prayer was offered, while basins were
          also placed to receive alms for the poor. The burial service of
          the Reformed was similar. In some countries the congregation
          recited the creed after the closing prayer.

          The desire to instruct the congregation on every occasion was
          expressed in the burial service by the reading of Scripture and
          the singing of hymns. A short discourse on death and the
          resurrection was read in the home, in the church, or at the
          grave, although a special sermon might be requested of the
          minister if he was specially paid for it, and in such eases he
          referred particularly to the life and death of the subject of
          his address. Thus arose the funeral sermon, which was originally
          designed to instruct the congregation in eschatology, and to
          honor the memory of the departed.

    5. Modern Developments.

          In modern times the burial rites were extended by carrying the
          cross before the procession, by casting earth upon the body
          thrice, and by pronouncing the benediction. The first two
          ceremonies were known even among the Protestants in former
          centuries and were occasionally used, although they were
          generally regarded with distrust, and were even directly
          prohibited. The blessing is connected with the prayer for the
          dead. The Reformed rejected prayers for the dead
          unconditionally, while Luther and the Augsburg Confession
          permitted it, and Johann Gerhard endeavored to prove its
          validity by dogmatics. From this developed the blessing of the
          dead, which, despite vehement opposition since the middle of the
          nineteenth century, has spread more and more. That the dead is
          addressed by "thou," may perhaps be explained on the ground
          that, according to the ancient Christian view, the congregation
          regards the departed as still belonging to it. The meaning of
          the solemn declaration: "I bless thee," however, is very
          uncertain, and the blessing should take the form of a wish.

          It should be noted that the Church of Rome prohibits cremation,
          whereas the Protestant Churches have not yet reached a uniform
          conclusion.

   Buridan, Jean
          BURIDAN, bUr´i-dan or French bü"rî´´d??n?´, JEAN (Johannes
          Buridanus): Medieval French philosopher; b. at Béthune (25 m.
          n.w. of Douai), in the latter part of the thirteenth century; d.
          after 1358. He was educated at Paris, and was made rector in
          1327. The story of his expulsion from the city, like his love
          affair with a queen of France, seems to be a myth, for it is
          clear that he occupied a prominent position at Paris between
          1348 and 1358. He was the author of the Summula de dialectica,
          or Compendium logicæ (Paris, 1487), and also wrote on the
          "Politics," "Ethics," and other Aristotelian writings, but he
          paid no attention to theology. As an admirer and follower of
          Occam, be was a consistent nominalist, and hence felt a special
          interest in ethical and psychological questions, in which he
          showed the characteristic union of skepticism and dogmatism. He
          became famous by his thorough research into the problem of the
          freedom of the will, but his works contain ingenious
          investigations rather than clear decisions, so that it is
          doubtful whether he was a determinist or an indeterminist. His
          psychology allowed no decision of the will without a motivating
          judgment of the understanding. The famous aphorism of the ass
          standing between two hay-stacks, and obliged either to starve or
          to decide deterministically for one or the other, is not found
          in his writings, and it is uncertain whether either he or his
          opponents used it, or whether later legend ascribed to him the
          example already found in Aristotle. His collected works were
          first edited at Paris by J. Dullardus in 1500, and were
          frequently reprinted.

          of St. Joseph's Church in the same city (1874-94). He was
          appointed vicar-general of the diocese of Albany in 1887 and
          consecrated bishop in 1894. He was created a Knight of the Holy

   Burma
          BURMA: [At present the largest and easternmost province of
          British India, having been gradually annexed after three wars in
          1826, 1852, and 1885. It extends southward from Tibet into the
          Malay peninsula a distance of 1,250 miles, with a breadth from
          east to west varying from 30 or 40 to 550 miles. According to
          the census of 1901 the area is 236,738 square miles, the
          population 10,490,624 persons, classed by religions as follows:
          Hindus 457,391; Sikhs 3,147; Buddhists 8,951,649 (85.3 per
          cent.); Mohammedans 533,973; Christians 248,628; Animists
          294,787; other religions 1,049. The native peoples are of
          Malay-Chinese stock, belonging to many tribes. The capital is
          Rangun. Buddhism appears at its best in Burma; the prevailing
          form is of the southern type, most closely approximating the
          teachings of Gautama, and it has done much to uplift the people,
          who are better educated (by the Buddhist monks) than the people
          of India. Temples and shrines are numerous and have been built
          at much expense. The monasteries are well organized.]

    Baptist Missions.

          The earliest attempt at Protestant missionary work in Burma was
          at Rangun, where Messrs. Chater and Mardon, of the Baptist
          Missionary Society of England, opened a mission in 1807. During
          a service of four years Chater translated the Gospel of Matthew
          into Burmese. Felix Carey, son of [592]William Carey, came soon
          after Chater and Mardon, remaining until 1814, when he entered
          the service of the Burman Government and removed to Ava. The
          London Missionary Society sent two missionaries to Rangun in
          1808, but within a year one died and the other left.

          The first permanent Protestant mission in Burma was that of the
          American Baptist Missionary Union, which began work at Rangun in
          1813. The first missionary was [593]Adoniram Judson, who
          translated the Bible into Burmese. Six years after he landed in
          Rangun the first convert was baptized, and then the work among
          the Burmans progressed, although slowly.

          The Karens, a hill tribe, early attracted the attention of the
          missionaries. They had strange traditions that they once had
          known of the true God, and that foreigners would restore to them
          the lost knowledge and the book containing it. In 1828 the first
          Karen convert, a slave redeemed by Dr. Judson, was baptized by
          [594]Rev. George Dana Boardman. The Karens have been more
          receptive of the Gospel than any other race in Burma. They are
          divided into many tribes; the chief dialects are the Sgaw and
          the Pwo, into which the Bible hen been translated. Self-support
          has been a marked feature of the Karen churches. They are
          distinctly missionary in spirit, representatives having gone
          from them to many other races. A remarkable development in the
          Karen mission is an independent evangelistic movement
          inaugurated and directed by a native leader, Ko San Ye. Large
          buildings have been erected and an institutional work is carried
          on. In one year over 2,500 converts were baptized in two
          stations alone as a result of this movement.

          Work is conducted also among the Shans, the Chins, the Kachins,
          the Talains, the immigrants from peninsulas India (mostly
          Telugus and Tamils), the Chinese, and the Eurasians and other
          English-speaking peoples. A movement of large proportions is
          taking place among the Lahu and other hill tribes about
          Kengtung, in eastern Burma, where over 2,000 were baptized in
          1905. They have peculiar traditions similar to those of the
          Karens.

          Educational work has been emphasized, village day-schools,
          station boarding-schools, and the Rangun Baptist College being
          conducted in co-operation with the government. The college has
          over 1,000 students in all departments. There are two
          theological seminaries at Insein, for Karens and Burmans
          respectively. The American Baptist Mission Press, at Rangun, has
          a fine equipment, and prints literature in most of the languages
          and dialects of the province.

    American Methodist Episcopal Missions.

          American Methodists entered Burma in 1879, when a church was
          organized by Bishop Thoburn. The mission has now grown to nine
          stations, where work is conducted for English-speaking peoples,
          Burmese, Tamils, Telugus, and Chinese. Emphasis is placed upon
          schools, colportage, and street preaching. The European high
          school in Rangun, for boys and girls, is the only one for
          non-conformists in the city and has a well-earned reputation for
          thoroughness and moral training. Anglo-vernacular schools are
          conducted in several stations. A number of strong schools are
          now being equipped with new and larger buildings. A training
          institute is held during the summer months. At Thandaung a
          successful orphanage is conducted. A monthly paper for Telugus
          is published.

    Society for the Propagation of the Gospel.

          This society conducts work among English-speaking peoples,
          Burmese, Karens, Tamils, Telugus, and Chins. Educational work is
          vigorously pushed, the leading institution being St. John's
          College, at Rangun, whose graduates take high rank. A
          printing-press at Toungoo provides Bibles, prayer-books, and
          other literature. There are 35 missionaries, 13 being European.

          Statistics (1905): Outstations, 196; churches, 15;

    Wesleyan Methodist Missions.

          English Wesleyans began work in 1889 and have now four stations,
          with seven missionaries. Special features are the work among
          soldiers, evangelistic-educational work, and a lepers' home, at
          Mandalay, which has 140 in its wards.

          Statistics (1903): Chapels and other preaching places, 26;
          catechists, 5; local preachers, 19; teachers (day-school), 62;
          members, 270; on trial, 61; Sunday-schools, 19; pupils in
          Sunday-schools, 1,065; day-schools, 25; pupils in day-schools,
          1,181; raised locally, £3,450 17s. 3d. The average attendance at
          public worship is 1,550.

    Roman Catholic Missions.

          Roman Catholic missionaries have been on the ground for several
          centuries, and are about equally divided between French and
          Italian. Their work is in various parts of Burma. The statistics
          for the French Foreign Missionary Society, including those for
          Laos, are as follows (1906): Missionaries, 70; native workers,
          3; charities, 65; total Roman Catholic population, 56,600.

    Miscellaneous.

          Besides the organizations mentioned, the Young Men's Christian
          Association and the Young Women's Christian Association have
          work at Rangun. The Mission to Lepers, the Missionary Pence
          Association, and the Leipsic Missionary Society also have work
          in Burma. The China Inland Mission has one missionary in Bhamo.

   Burmann, Frans
          BURMANN, FRANS: Dutch theologian; b. at Leyden 1628; d. at
          Utrecht Nov. 12, 1679. At twenty-three he took the pastoral
          charge of a new Dutch church at Hanau; in 1661 he became
          vice-rector of the college at Leyden, and the next year
          professor of dogmatic theology at Utrecht, combining this
          position with a pastoral charge there, and teaching church
          history also from 1671. His principal work, Synopsis theologiæ
          (2 vols., Utrecht, 1671-72), shows him to have been the clearest
          systematic thinker of the school of [595]Cocceius. He also wrote
          Dutch commentaries on all the historical books of the Old
          Testament (collected edition Amsterdam, 1740), and several minor
          works.

          w. of Winton), Nov. 12, 1785. He studied at Queen's College,
          Oxford (B.A., 1734); became vicar of Orton 1736, and was justice
          of the peace for Westmoreland and Cumberland; chancellor of
          Carlisle 1765. His works include two standard treatises, The
          Justice of the Peace and Parish Officer, comprehending all the
          law to the present time (2 vols., London, 1755; 29th edition,
          enlarged, edited by Chitty and Bere, 6 vols., 1845; 30th ed.,

   Burnet, Gilbert
          BURNET, GILBERT: Bishop of Salisbury; b. in Edinburgh Sept. 18,
          1643; d. at Salisbury Mar. 17, 1715. He was educated at
          Aberdeen; became a probationer 1661; studied and traveled in
          England, Holland, and France till 1664; became minister at
          Saltoun 1665; professor of divinity at Glasgow 1669; removed to
          London 1674 and was made chaplain at the Rolls Chapel, and
          lecturer at St. Clement's, 1675. The popularity he enjoyed in
          Scotland did not forsake him in London, but his intimacy with
          Lord William Russell, whom he attended on the scaffold (July 21,
          1683), cost him the court favor and he was dismissed from both
          these positions. On the accession of James II. he left England
          and, after visiting France and Italy, settled at The Hague and
          was active in promoting the accession of William and Mary. He
          returned to England with William in 1688 and by him was made in
          1689 bishop of Salisbury, in which office he was a model. His
          family connections, wealth, and ambition, his scholarship,
          friendships, and positions, his employment in diplomacy and
          honorable politics, all qualified him to write his admirable
          History of his own Time (i., London, 1723; ii., 1734; best ed.
          by M. J. Routh, 8 vols., Oxford, 1833; Part I. The Reign of
          Charles the Second, edited by Osmund Airy, 2 vols., 1897-1900; a
          Supplement to the History was edited by Miss H. C. Foxcroft,
          1902), a work of great accuracy and fairness. Other works worthy
          of mention are: History of the Reformation of the Church of
          England (i., 1679; ii., 1681; iii., 1714; ed. N. Pocock, 7
          vols., 1865); his works against the Roman Catholic Church, The
          mystery of iniquity unveiled (1673); Rome's glory, or a
          collection of divers miracles wrought by popish saints, (1673);
          Infallibility of the Roman Church confuted (1680); also his life
          of William Bedell (1685); Exposition of the XXXIX. Articles
          (1699), which was censured by the Lower House of Convocation.

          Bibliography: The Life, by his son, Thomas B. Burnet, is
          prefixed to the Oxford edition of his works, in 6 vols., 1833,

          account is given in DNB, vii. 394-405. Consult also S. A.

   Burnet, Thomas
          BURNET, THOMAS: Church of England; b. at Croft (40 m. n. of
          York), Yorkshire, about 1635; d. in London Sept. 27, 1715. He
          studied at Clare Hall and Christ's College, Cambridge (fellow of
          Christ's, 1657; M.A., 1658; LL.D., 1685?); became master of the
          Charterhouse 1685, and in 1686 incited the first stand made by
          any society in England against the royal dispensing power in the
          reign of James II., and thereby prevented the illegal admission
          of a pensioner at the king's demand. He wrote fine English and
          excellent Latin, and was the author of several books which
          created much commotion. The Telluris theoria sacra (part i.,
          London, 1681; Eng, version, revised, The Sacred Theory of the
          Earth, 1684; part ii. and Eng. version of the entire work, 1689;
          7th ed., with life by Ralph Heathcote, 1759) was a fanciful
          attempt to explain the structure of the earth, and of no
          scientific value. In the Archeologiæ philosophicæ sive doctrina
          antiqua de rerum originibus (1692; Eng. transl., 1692) he
          interpreted the account of the Fall as an allegory, and the work
          cost him his position as clerk of the closet to William III. and
          marred his hope of advancement. In later life he wrote De fide
          et officiis Christianorum, in which "he regards the historical
          religions as based upon the religion of nature and rejects
          original sin and the 'magical' theory of the sacraments"; and De
          statu mortuorum et resurgentium, in which he defended the
          doctrine of the middle state, the millennium, and the limited
          duration of future punishment; these works were first
          authoritatively printed in 1727 (Eng. translations, 1727-28).

   Burnett Prizes and Lectures
          BURNETT PRIZES AND LECTURES: A foundation by John Burnett, a
          merchant of Aberdeen, Scotland (b. 1729; d. 1784), who
          bequeathed his entire estate for charitable and philanthropic
          purposes. One of the provisions of his will vested a portion of
          his property in trustees to provide prizes for the best and the
          next best essay intended to prove "that there is a Being,
          all-powerful, wise, and good, by whom everything exists; and
          particularly to obviate difficulties regarding the wisdom and
          goodness of the Deity; and this, in the first place, from
          considerations independent of written revelation, and, in the
          second place, from the revelation of the Lord Jesus; and, from
          the whole, to point out the inferences most necessary for, and
          useful to mankind." It was provided that the competition should
          be open to the whole world; that the prizes should be of not
          less than £1,200 and £400 respectively, and should be offered at
          intervals of forty years; and that three appointees of the
          trustees of the testator's estate, the ministers of the
          Established Church of Aberdeen, and the principals and
          professors of King's and Marinchal Colleges should act as
          judges. The first competition was in 1815, when fifty essays
          were submitted and the first prize was given to William Laurence
          Brown (b. 1755; professor at Utrecht, 1788-95; at Marinchal
          College, 1795, principal from 1796; d. 1830) for a treatise On
          the Existence of a Supreme Creator (2 vols., Aberdeen, 1816),
          and the second to [596]John Bird Summer, afterward archbishop of
          Canterbury, for an essay entitled Records of Creation (2 vols.,
          London, 1818). In the second competition, 1855, out of 208
          essays the judges selected Christian Theism (2 vols., London,
          1855) by Robert Anchor Thompson (b. 1821; curate of Binbrook,
          Lincolnshire, 1854-58; from 1858 master of the Hospital of St.
          Mary the Virgin, Newcastle-on-Tyne; d. 1894) for the first
          prize, and Theism (Edinburgh, 1855) by [597]John Tulloch for the
          second prize. In 1881 the use of the fund was changed by being
          applied to the support of a lectureship at Aberdeen, the
          lecturer to be appointed at intervals of five years and hold
          office for three years, and the subject to be either that
          prescribed by Mr. Burnett or some topic of history, archeology,
          or physical or natural science, so treated as to illustrate the
          theme originally suggested. Lecturers and subjects have been as
          follows:

          1883-86. George Gabriel Stokes, professor of mathematics at
          Cambridge, On Light (London, 1887).

          1888-91. W. Robertson Smith, professor of Arabic at Cambridge,
          On the Religion of the Semites (1st series only published,
          Fundamental Institutions, London, 1889; 3d ed., 1907).

          1891-94. William L. Davidson, minister of Bourtie,
          Aberdeenshire, Theism as Grounded in Human Nature historically
          and critically Handled (London, 1893).

          The funds are now devoted toward the endowment of a chair of
          history and archeology in the university.

   Burns, William Chalmers
          BURNS, WILLIAM CHALMERS: Missionary; b. at Dun (6 m. w. of
          Montrose), Forfarshire, Scotland, Apr. 1, 1815; d. at
          Niu-chwang, China, Apr. 4, 1868. He studied at Marischal
          College, Aberdeen; began the study of law, but decided to become
          a minister and reentered the university in 1832; studied
          theology at Glasgow and was licensed in 1839; preached first in
          Dundee, and then traveled through the British Islands and
          visited Canada (1844-46) as an evangelist, meeting with much
          success. On June 9, 1847, he sailed as first missionary to China
          of the English Presbyterian Missionary Society; he adopted the
          Chinese dress and life and lived in Hongkong, Canton, Amoy,
          Shanghai, Peking, and Niu-chwaag, choosing not to stay long in
          one place. He was one of the most devoted missionaries of modern
          times and won the respect of both the natives of China and the
          foreign residents. He translated Bunyan's Pilgrim's Progress
          into Chinese.

          7, 1837. He was educated at Brown University (B.A., 1861), and
          entered Newton Theological Institution, but left it in 1862 and
          served in the 36th Massachusetts Volunteers throughout the Civil
          War, rising from private to brevet major and acting assistant

   Burritt, Elihu
          BURRITT, ELIHU: American Congregational layman, scholar, and
          philanthropist; b. at New Britain, Conn., Dec. 8, 1810; d. there
          Mar. 6, 1879. While earning his living by his trade of
          blacksmith, he acquired before the age of thirty some
          acquaintance with most of the languages of Europe, and also with
          Hebrew, Samaritan, and Ethiopic. So although modest and
          deprecating notoriety, he became known as "the learned
          blacksmith." In 1841 he was invited to lecture, and prepared an
          address on "Application and Genius," in which he argued that all
          attainments are the result of persistent will and application
          alone. His lecturing was successful, and thenceforth he was
          prominent before the public as orator, editor, and
          philanthropist. In 1846 he went to England. For the next
          twenty-five years he spent most of his time abroad. He organized
          "The League of Universal Brotherhood" to work for the abolition
          of war and to promote friendly feelings between different
          peoples, and was active in connection with the first Peace
          Congress at Brussels in 1848 and similar gatherings afterward.
          He developed the idea of an "ocean penny postage," i.e., the
          reduction of the high rates then charged on international
          letters to a sum not more than double the domestic rate. After
          the outbreak of the Crimean War he returned to America and
          advocated the emancipation of the negro slaves, with
          compensation to the owners. From 1865 to 1869 he was consular
          agent of the United States at Birmingham. After 1870 he lived in
          retirement at New Britain, but was busy with his pen. He was
          always active in church work and strove to promote Christian
          fellowship between different creeds and confessions. He
          published many works, including: Sparks from the Anvil (London,
          1847); Thoughts and Things at Home and Abroad (Boston, 1854);
          Walk from London to John O'Groat's House (London, 1864); Walk
          from London to Land's End and Back (1865); Walks in the Black
          Country and its Green Border Lands (1866); Lectures and Speeches
          (1866); The Mission of Great Suffering (1867): Prayers and
          Meditations from the Psalms (New York, 1869); Sanskrit Handbook
          (London, 1874). He founded and edited a number of periodicals
          for the promotion of his plans, of which the most important were
          The Christian Citizen, devoted to "peace, freedom, temperance,
          and every good cause" (Worcester, Mass., 1844-51), and Bonds of
          Brotherhood (London, 1846-68),

   Burroughes (Burroughs), Jeremiah
          BURROUGHES (BURROUGHS), JEREMIAH: English Congregationalist; b.
          about 1600; d. in London Nov. 13, 1646. He studied at Emmanuel
          College, Cambridge, and was graduated M.A. in 1624, but left the
          university because of non-conformity; was assistant to
          [599]Edmund Calamy at Bury St. Edmunds; in 1631 became rector of
          Tivetshall, Norfolk; suspended for non-conformity in 1636 and
          soon afterward deprived, he went to Rotterdam (1637) and became
          "teacher" of the English church there; returned to England in
          1641 and served as preacher at Stepney and Cripplegate, London.
          He was a member of the Westminster Assembly and one of the few
          who opposed the Presbyterian majority. While one of the most
          distinguished of the English Independents, he was one of the
          most moderate, acting consistently in accordance with the motto
          on his study door: Opinionum varietas et opinantium unitas non
          sunt asustata ("Difference of belief and unity of believers are
          not inconsistent"). His publications were many, the most
          important being An Exposition with Practical Observations on the
          Prophecy of Hosea (4 vols., London, 1643-57).

   Burroughs (Burrough), George
          BURROUGHS (BURROUGH), GEORGE: The most prominent victim of the
          Salem witchcraft delusion; b. about 1650; executed on Gallows
          Hill, Salem, Mass., Aug. 19, 1692. He was graduated at Harvard,
          1670; preached at Casco (Portland), Me.; at Salem Village
          (Danvers), Mass., 1680-83, where he suffered because of a church
          quarrel antedating his pastorate; was in Casco again in 1685,
          and when the town was destroyed by the French and Indians in
          May, 1690. In 1692, while acting as preacher at Wells, Me., he
          was accused of witchcraft by certain of his old parishioners at
          Salem and arrested; was brought to trial at Salem Aug. 5 and
          convicted on all indictments against him; before his execution
          he made an address which moved the hearers to tears and led
          Cotton Mather to remind the crowd that the devil often appeared
          as an angel of light.

          and examining chaplain to the bishop of Wakefield in 1888-1905.
          Since 1904 he has been archdeacon of Birmingham, and since 1905
          has also been examining chaplain to the bishop of Birmingham. In
          addition to briefer contributions, he has written The Mystery of
          the Cross (London, 1896).

   Bursfelde, Congregation of
          BURSFELDE, CONGREGATION OF: An association of reformed
          Benedictine monks, taking its name from the abbey of Bursfelde
          on the Weser, about 10 m. west of Göttingen, founded by Count
          Henry of Nordheim and his wife Gertrude in 1093. It had been
          richly endowed, but by the beginning of the fifteenth century
          was so far fallen into decay that only a single monk lived
          there, and he in great poverty, while the church was used by
          traveling merchants as a stable. Johann of Minden, abbot of
          Rheinhausen, with Rembert ter List, prior of the Windesheim
          monastery of Wittenberg, was charged with reforming monastic
          life in Saxony and Brunswick after the Council of Basel; and the
          case of Bursfelde was specially commended to him by Duke Otto of
          Brunswick. He took up the task in 1433, and obtained the monks
          he needed from the abbey of St. Matthias at Treves. Dying in
          1439, he left an equally energetic successor in Johann Hagen,
          who thoroughly completed the task in the thirty years of his
          rule, and founded the Congregation, including four other
          monasteries, with a view to the strict observance of the
          monastic rule, after the model of the [600]Windesheim
          Congregation. The spirit grew until Hagen could number
          thirty-six monasteries, besides some nunneries, under his
          leadership. The movement spread into the Netherlands also, under
          the influence of Jan Busch and Nicholas of Cusa. A yearly
          chapter of the whole congregation was held, always under the
          presidency of the abbot of Bursfelde. It received numerous
          privileges from the provincial council held by Nicholas of Cusa
          in 1451, and was confirmed by Pius II. in 1458 and 1461. It grew
          after Hagen's death until it numbered 142 monasteries; but in
          the sixteenth century it began to decline, though there was a
          brief revival about 1629 and during the Thirty Years' War. Many
          of the monasteries came into the possession of Protestant
          princes, including Bursfelde itself, whose Catholic abbot was
          replaced in 1579 by a Lutheran. Since the foundation of the
          University of Göttingen, the senior professor of the theological
          faculty has borne the title of abbot of Bursfelde, with an
          income derived from the revenues of the foundation. The last
          head of the Congregation was Bernhard Bierbaum, abbot of Werden,
          who was elected in 1780 at a chapter held in Hildesheim and died
          in 1798.

          trustee of Kenyon College and of the University of the South, as
          well as a member of the Joint Commission of the General
          Convention on Christian Education. In theology he belongs to the
          conservative school. His publications include sermons, charges,
          contributions to periodicals, and the section on the annals of
          Henrico Parish, Va., in J. S. Moore's Virginiana (Richmond,
          1904).

   Burton, Robert
          BURTON, ROBERT: Author of the Anatomy of Melancholy; b. at
          Lindley (20 m. e.n.e. of Birmingham), Leicestershire, Feb. 8,
          1577; d. at Oxford Jan. 25, 1640. He studied at Brasenose and
          Christ Church, Oxford (B.D., 1614); became vicar of St. Thomas,
          in the west suburbs of Oxford, 1616, and in addition, about
          1630, rector of Segrave, Leicestershire. His life was spent
          among his books at Oxford; Anthony Wood, a generation after his
          death, describes him as a good mathematician, a philologist, and
          astrologer, a hard student and well-read scholar, considered by
          some melancholy and morose, but by those who knew him better
          esteemed for honesty and charity, and as a merry and genial
          companion. His famous work (Oxford, 1621), which is a vast
          collection of quotations and allusions, abundantly proves his
          learning. Five editions appeared during Burton's life, each with
          many alterations and additions and a sixth was printed from his
          annotated manuscript (1651-52). The edition of 1800 contains an
          account of the author. There is a modern edition by A. R.
          Shilleto, with introduction by A. H. Bullen (London, 1893). The
          Philosophaster is a Latin comedy written in 1606 and acted at
          Christ Church on Shrove Monday (Feb. 16), 1618; with certain
          Latin poemata it was printed for the Roxburghe Club (London,
          1862).

   Burwash, Nathaniel
          BURWASH, NATHANIEL: Methodist Episcopalian; b. at Argenteuil,
          Quebec, July 25, 1839. He was educated at Victoria College,
          Cobourg, Ont. (B.A., 1859), Yale College, and Garrett Biblical
          Institute, Evanston, Ill. (B.D., 1871). He entered the Methodist
          Episcopal ministry in 1860, and after acting as classical tutor
          in Victoria College in 1860-1861, held pastorates until 1866,
          when he was recalled to Victoria College as professor of natural
          science. He was made dean of the theological faculty in the same
          institution in 1873, and since 1887 has been its president and
          chancellor. He is also a member of the senate and council of the
          University of Toronto and of the council of education for the
          province of Ontario. He has been a member of successive general
          conferences of his denomination since 1874, and was president of
          the one held in 1889-90, in addition to being secretary of
          education for the Methodist Episcopal Church in Canada from 1874
          to 1886. He has written: Memorials of Edward and Lydia Jackson
          (Toronto, 1876); Genesis, Nature, and Results of Sin (1878);
          Wesley's Doctrinal Standards (188I); Relation of Children to the
          Fall, the Atonement, and the Church (1882); Handbook on the
          Epistle to the Romans (1887); Inductive Studies in Theology
          (1896); Manual of Christian Theology (1900); Life and Times of

          Toronto as a Provincial Institution (1905).

   Bury, Richard de
          BURY, RICHARD DE: Bishop of Durham; b. at Bury St. Edmunds (61
          m. n.e. of London) 1281, the son of Sir Richard Aungerville; d.
          at Auckland (11 m. s.w. of Durham) Apr. 14, 1345. He studied at
          Oxford, then entered the Benedictine order at Durham, became
          tutor to the future Edward Ill., who on his accession (1327)
          entrusted various offices to him, and sent him twice to Pope
          John XXII. as ambassador, and later in the same capacity to
          Paris, Hainault, and Germany, and as commissioner for the
          affairs of Scotland. He was made dean of Wells, and the same
          year (1333) bishop of Durham. Useful as he was to the king and
          his country as a diplomat, and able as he was as an
          ecclesiastic, he is remembered solely as a bibliophile, perhaps
          the earliest in England worthy of the name. He has no claim to
          be considered a scholar, but he loved books and used all his
          personal and official influence in their accumulation. Wherever
          he was, he was on the lookout for MSS., and he also had agents
          on the Continent in the search for them. So he had more books
          than all the other English bishops put together. Some of these
          MSS. he stored in his palace, others he is said to have
          deposited in the library he founded in Oxford in connection with
          Durham College (on the site of the present Trinity College). His
          love of books comes out in that bibliophile's delight, the
          Philobiblon (first published at Cologne, 1473, next at Speyer,
          1483, and in Paris, 1500). It has been often republished, the
          best edition, having both the Latin text and an English
          translation, being by Ernest C. Thomas (London, 1888), and Mr.
          Thomas's translation was reprinted 1902.

   Busch, Jan
          BUSCH, JAN: Dutch monastic reformer; b. at Zwolle (52 m. e.n.e.
          of Amsterdam) Aug. 9, 1399; d. at Sülte, near Hildesheim, c.
          1480. Educated first in the school of Zwolle, which then, under
          its famous rector Cele, numbered about a thousand students, he
          went to Erfurt at the age of eighteen to study law; but his
          inclination was for the monastic life, and in 1419 he entered
          the Windesheim house, of which Vos was then prior. He labored
          diligently to overcome theoretical doubts by study of the
          Scriptures and spiritual writers, and to form himself
          practically in the devout life. Vos, on his death-bed, exhorted
          him to constancy in reforming zeal, and he was soon sent to
          Bödingen near Cologne, where he was ordained priest. He remained
          four years at Bödingen, and then, after a short stay in the
          mother house, received a more difficult commission, being sent
          to Ludinkerken in East Friesland, where conditions of shocking
          laxity prevailed, but the great papal schism, a contested
          episcopal election, and his own weak health prevented him from
          accomplishing much there. After some years of comparative rest,
          he began his more important work in 1437 as subprior of the
          reformed monastery of Wittenberg near Hildesheim, which was to
          extend over a large part of Germany and to embrace especially,
          in the spirit of the Council of Basel, the reform of the
          Augustinian, convents of both sexes, particularly in Saxony.
          Working in harmony with the [601]Bursfelde Congregation, he
          began with the neighboring monastery of Sülte, of which he took
          charge himself, with the title of provost, commonly used in
          Saxony instead of prior. His success in restoring discipline
          there induced the archbishop of Magdeburg in 1446 to place in
          his hands the Premonstratensian house of Our Lady in the same
          city. In the following year be became provost of the rich
          Neuwerkstift at Halle, combining with it the office of
          archdeacon, which gave him authority over 700 secular priests.
          After the plague of 1450, he went on to Glauchau, where he
          enjoyed the powerful support of his friend Nicholas of Cusa, who
          had been sent to Germany as cardinal-legate with special
          reference to monastic reform. After a provincial synod at
          Bergen, the legate entrusted Busch with the oversight of this
          work in the entire province, giving him full power to inspect
          all monasteries and reform whatever disorders he found, taking
          the Windesheim statutes as a standard. He went vigorously to
          work in Halle, Leipsic, and Halberstadt, but in 1452 the
          opposition aroused by his zeal led to demands for his removal
          being laid before the pope and the archbishop. At first they
          were fruitless, but when Busch found the archbishop cooling
          toward him, he resigned his office of provost, still retaining
          his powers as visitor. In 1456 he went to attend a general
          chapter at Windesheim, and remained there several years, living
          as a simple brother and employing the time in literary work. He
          wrote the lives of the first twenty-four brothers and of his
          teacher Cele (Liber de viris illustribus de Windeshem), as well
          as a chronicle of the house and congregation. He took up active
          work again as provost of Sülte, and exercised his visitatorial
          powers over a still wider field, at the same time writing an
          account of his work which is of some value. He resigned his
          office as provost in 1479, and probably died in the following
          year. His Chronicon Windeshemense was first printed by Heribert
          Rosweyde at Antwerp in 1621, and an incomplete edition of his
          four books De reformatione monasteriorum was prepared by G. W.
          von Leibnitz, in Scriptores rerum Brunsvicensium (3 vols.,
          Hanover, 1707-11); an excellent modern edition, with
          introduction and notes, is that of K. Grube (Halle, 1886). A few
          smaller works, letters, and sermons, have recently been
          discovered and published by J. M. Wüstenhoff (Ghent, 1890).

   Busembaum (Busenbaum), Hermann
          BUSEMBAUM (BUSENBAUM), HERMANN: German Jesuit, casuist; b. at
          Nottelen (a village of Westphalia) 1600; d. at Münster Jan. 31,
          1668. He was a teacher at Cologne, and afterward rector at
          Hildesheim and Münster. His text-book of casuistry, entitled
          Medulla theologiæ moralis (Münster, 1645), in seven books, ran
          through 200 editions before 1776, although it caused offense
          when it was published with a commentary in 1710. The book
          contained the Jesuitic teachings on regicide, and in France,
          when an attempt was made to assassinate Louis XIV., the matter
          was brought before the courts. The Paris parliament was
          satisfied with simply condemning the book, while that of
          Toulouse had it publicly burned and held the principals of
          institutions who used it responsible. Meanwhile the moral
          theology of the Medulla was incorporated in the classical
          text-book of the order of Redemptorists, edited by Liguori.
          Busembaum's Lilium inter spinas (Cologne, 1660) is ascetic in
          character.

          12, 1796; d. at Rochester, N. Y., Sept. 19, 1859. He was
          graduated at Dartmouth, 1818; studied at Princeton Theological
          Seminary, 1820-22; was tutor in Princeton College, 1822-23; went
          to Indiana for the Home Missionary Society in 1824 and was
          pastor of a Presbyterian church at Indianapolis 1825-28;
          professor of Hebrew and Oriental literature in the University of
          the City of New York 1831-47; instructor of sacred literature in
          Union Theological Seminary in the same city 1836-37. In 1845 he
          connected himself with the Swedenborgians and was preacher of
          the New Church Society in New York 1848-52, in Brooklyn 1854-59.
          He was an active defender of the tenets of his faith with both
          pen and voice, and edited the New Church Repository and Monthly
          Review 1848-55. His writings on other subjects include: Life of
          Mohammed (New York, 1832); A Treatise on the Millennium (1832);
          A Grammar of the Hebrew Language (1835); Notes Critical and
          Practical on the Old Testament (Genesis-Judges, 8 vols., 1840
          sqq.); Anastasis (1845), against the doctrine of the
          resurrection of the body. He was justly esteemed as a Hebrew
          scholar.

   Bushnell, Horace
          BUSHNELL, HORACE: Congregationalist; b. at Litchfield, Conn.,
          Apr. 14, 1802; d. in Hartford, Conn., Feb. 17, 1876. He was
          graduated at Yale College, 1827; after an interval spent in
          teaching and journalism, he returned (1829) to study law in the
          Yale Law School, but after two years, during which he was a
          tutor in the college, was converted and studied for the ministry
          in the Yale Divinity School and graduated in the class of 1833.
          He was pastor of the North Church, Hartford, Conn., from May 22,
          1833, till Nov. 22, 1859, when he resigned on account of his
          health, though he continued his ministrations with undiminished
          power. His distinction rests upon several great works: (1) His
          Christian Nurture (Hartford, 1846)--a contribution of the first
          rank to religious thought--in which he drew attention away from
          revivals to the training of children in Christian households as
          the law of growth in the Church. (2) His doctrine of the
          "Instrumental Trinity" (God in Christ, New York, 1849), showing
          affinities with Sabellianism, but lifting the idea of the
          Trinity out of the region of speculation and making it available
          for actual life (see [602]Christology, IX., 3, § 4). (3) His
          supreme emphasis on ethical and religious values and his refusal
          of metaphysics; here he anticipates the Ritschlian attitude, the
          ground of which for him lay not in philosophy, but in a theory
          of language ("Dissertation on Language," in God in Christ; "Our
          Gospel a Gift to the Imagination," in Building Eras, New York,
          1881) and in a profound Christian experience. (4) His moral view
          of the [603]Atonement, "grounded in principles of universal
          obligation" and universal vicariousness, later modified by the
          idea of God as propitiating himself in the forgiveness of the
          sinner (The Vicarious Sacrifice, New York, 1865; Forgiveness and
          Law, ib. 1874--the two volumes published under the title The
          Vicarious Sacrifice, 1877). (5) In apologetics Bushnell related
          "Miracles" to "Law," and drew his matchless picture of "The
          Character of Jesus Forbidding his Possible Classification with
          Men" (Nature and the Supernatural, New York, 1858). (6) Many of
          his sermons are unsurpassed for insight, feeling, imagination,
          noble thought, and splendor of diction. Yet by his own
          generation he was generally called a heretic; and for his
          condemnation there was a demand throughout the American orthodox
          churches! In 1849 and 1851 he was actually accused of heresy in
          formal fashion, and still more savagely attacked after 1866, but
          his congregation stood by him and he was not tried. The present
          generation in America venerates him as one of the molders of
          religious opinion, and has been influenced by him more perhaps
          than it knows. A centenary edition of his works appeared in
          twelve volumes (New York, 1903).

          (22 m. s.e. of Calais), France, May 15, 1773. He was educated at
          Douai and became professor there of philosophy and divinity; was
          ordained priest, 1735; traveled through France and Italy,
          1745-46, and then was sent for a short time to the Roman
          Catholic mission in Staffordshire. Later he was tutor to Edward
          Howard, duke of Norfolk, and accompanied him to Paris; about
          1766 he became president of the English college at St. Omer. He
          labored for thirty years on his chief work, The Lives of the
          Fathers, Martyrs, and Other Principal Saints, which was
          published anonymously in four volumes (vol. iii., 2 parts) at
          London, 1756-59. The second edition, with notes and other matter
          omitted in the first edition, edited by Dr. Carpenter,
          archbishop of Dublin, appeared at Dublin in twelve volumes in
          1779-80. It has appeared in several later editions and
          abridgments (as by F. C. Husenbeth, with omission of the notes
          and most of the shorter lives, 2 vols., London, 1857-60), and
          was translated into French and Italian. His nephew, [604]Charles
          Butler, prepared a continuation (London, 1823). A complete
          general index was published in 1886.

          College, Davenport, Ia., where he completed his theological
          education in 1873. He was ordered deacon in the same year, and
          was ordained priest in 1874. He was successively assistant in
          Grace Cathedral, Davenport, Ia. (1873), and rector of Grace
          Church, Cedar Rapids, Ia. (1873-77), Trinity Church, Bay City,

          (1884-91), and Christ Church, Red Wing, Minn. (1891-94). Since
          1894 he has been warden and professor of homiletics, liturgies,
          and religious pedagogy in Seabury Divinity School, Faribault,
          Minn. He was active in organizing the Parochial Mission Society
          of the United States, and was chosen secretary of its executive
          committee, and also took a prominent part in establishing the
          first deaconess school in the Protestant Episcopal Church. He is
          likewise a member of the Joint Commission on Sunday Schools and
          of the General Convention of the Protestant Episcopal Church. He
          has written: How to Study the Life of Christ (New York, 1902);
          How shall we worship God? (1904); and The Churchman's Manual of
          Sunday School Methods (Milwaukee, 1906).

   Butler, James Glentworth
          BUTLER, JAMES GLENTWORTH: Presbyterian; b. at Brooklyn, N. Y.,
          Aug. 3, 1821. He was educated at New York University (did not
          graduate), Union Theological Seminary (1846-47), and Yale
          Divinity School, being graduated from the latter in 1849. After
          being a resident licentiate at the same institution in 1849-50,
          he was ordained to the Presbyterian ministry late in 1852 and
          was pastor of the Walnut Street Presbyterian Church,
          Philadelphia, Pa., until 1868. He was then elected corresponding
          secretary of the American and Foreign Christian Union, a
          position which he retained three years, after which he was
          pastor of the First Presbyterian Church, Brooklyn, for two years
          (1871-73). In 1874 he retired from the active ministry, and has
          since lived the life of a private scholar. In addition to a
          number of briefer contributions, he prepared The Bible Reader's
          Commentary, New Testament (2 vols., New York, 1879), which was
          afterward enlarged under the title Bible Work (11 vols., 1892)
          and made to include the Old Testament; and Vital Truths
          respecting God and Man (Philadelphia, 1904).

   Butler, John George
          BUTLER, JOHN GEORGE: Lutheran; b. at Cumberland, Md., Jan. 28,
          1826. He was educated at Pennsylvania College (1846) and
          Gettysburg Theological Seminary, Gettysburg, Pa (1847-1849), and
          was pastor of St. Paul's English Lutheran Church, Washington, D.
          C., from 1849 to 1873. Since the latter year he has been pastor
          of the Luther Place Memorial Church in the same city. He also
          served throughout the Civil War as a chaplain is and near
          Washington, was chaplain of the House of Representatives from
          1869 to 1875, and of the Senate from 1866 to 1893. He was
          likewise professor of homiletics and church history in Howard
          University, Washington, from 1871 to 1891, and for many years
          was Washington correspondent of the Lutheran's Observer and the
          Lutheran Evangelist, and has also been the editor of the latter
          paper since 1893.

   Butler, Joseph
          BUTLER, JOSEPH: Bishop of Durham; b. at Wantage (14 m. s.w. of
          Oxford) May 18, 1692; d. at Bath June 16, 1752. He was the
          youngest of the eight children of Thomas Butler, a retired
          linen-draper and stanch Presbyterian, but was allowed to enter
          Oriel College, Oxford, and in 1718 the ministry of the Church of
          England. From 1719 to 1726 he was preacher at the Rolls Chapel,
          London, where most of the congregation were lawyers and the pay
          small; from 1721 to 1738 he was prebendary of Salisbury; from
          1721 to 1725, rector of Haughton-le-Skerne (2 m. n.e. of
          Darlington); and from 1725 to 1740 of Stanhope (26 m. n. of
          Darlington). From 1733 to 1740 he was a prebendary of Rochester;
          from 1733 to 1736 chaplain to the lord chancellor; from 1736 to
          her death in 1737 clerk of the closet to Caroline, queen consort
          of George II.; from 1738 to 1750 bishop of Bristol, the poorest
          see in England; from 1740 to 1750 dean of St. Paul's with a
          prebend and residentiary canony; from 1746 to 1750 clerk of the
          closet to the King (George II.); from 1750 till his death,
          bishop of Durham, the richest see in England. As appears from
          the above, he was a pluralist. He was not, however, avaricious,
          but generous to a fault. He was shy, reticent, sensitive, more
          of a thinker than a reader, and he never married. His one great
          aim was to combat the current Deism and contempt for religion.
          This he did with unrivaled force. He had the very expensive
          taste of building and spent much money in reconstructing his
          episcopal residences.

          His reputation rests upon his writings, all published by himself
          or in his lifetime, as his literary remains were destroyed at
          his death, according to his direction. These writings are few in
          number but weighty in matter. This is the full list: Fifteen
          Sermons Preached at the Rolls Chapel (1726); The Analogy of
          Religion Natural and Revealed to the Constitution and Course of
          Nature (1736); six occasional sermons of various dates; a part
          of his episcopal charge at Bristol in 1749, and his episcopal
          charge at Durham in 1751; and the correspondence, down to 1714,
          between himself and Samuel Clarke, which the latter published in
          the fourth edition (1716) of his Boyle lectures on the Being and
          Attributes of God, and separately the same year, but which has
          received additions.

          To understand and appreciate these writings of Butler one must
          bear in mind two facts: Butler lived in the "golden age of
          English Deism," when Christianity, as he himself says, was "not
          so much as a subject of inquiry; but that it is, now at length,
          discovered to be fictitious"; and secondly that he was intensely
          practical. He wrote his famous Fifteen Sermons, as J. H. Bernard
          says, "not to propound a new basis for speculative ethics, but
          to justify to practical men the practice of the common virtues,
          benevolence, compassion, and the like. He desires to take human
          nature as an existing fact, and to analyze its constituents just
          so far as is necessary to bring to light the obligations to
          right living." His Six Sermons are likewise practical: The first
          is a defense of foreign missions; the second is an appeal for
          the London hospitals; the third is on the true way to safeguard
          liberty; the fourth is a plea for charity schools; the fifth is
          upon the uses to which the union of Church and State should be
          put, and the sixth upon the proper management of infirmaries. Of
          like practicality is his more famous Analogy. He took the Deists
          on their own ground and strove to cut the ground from under
          their feet in order that he might bring them to the Christian
          foundation. To quote Bernard again: "We find in Butler's works
          no attempt to construct a philosophy of religion nor . . . an
          analysis of the religious consciousness. . . . Religion is
          treated altogether from the historical point of view. Its main
          doctrines are facts and are susceptible of proof, just like any
          other facts. . . . It is an argumentum ad hominem all through,
          and is not intended to present an absolute and consecutive
          statement of the grounds of faith. . . . His point was, not that
          the difficulties of revelation repeat the difficulties of
          nature, but rather the difficulties of revelation, admitted to
          be embarrassing in themselves, cannot be counted destructive of
          religious belief, inasmuch as difficulties of a similar nature
          beset the recognition of nature as a coherent and systematic
          whole."

          The first part of the Analogy, consisting of seven chapters, is
          the Analogy of Natural Religion to the constitution and course
          of Nature; and is generally considered more successful than the
          second part, in eight chapters, on the Analogy of Revealed
          Religion to the constitution and course of Nature (or a kind of
          evidences of Christianity). But both parts are very hard
          reading, because, though perfectly clear, the argument is very
          profound. It has been a college and university text-book for
          nigh 175 years and the quarry of innumerable works.

          There are many editions of Butler. Two of remarkable excellence
          are that by the late W. E. Gladstone (two vols., Oxford, 1896,
          with a volume of Gladstone's Studies subsidiary to Butler's
          works) and that by J. H. Bernard (2 vols., London, 1900).

          BibliographyThe earliest Life appeared in the Biographia
          Britannica, in the Supplement, London, 1753, and the Life by
          Kippis, which appeared in his ed, of the Biographie, London,
          1778-93, is often prefixed to the Works or to the Analogy.

          1818; d. at Old Orchard, Me., Aug. 18, 1899. He was graduated at
          Didsbury College, near Manchester, Eng., 1844, and the same year
          became a member of the Irish Wesleyan Conference. In 1850 he
          came to America and joined the New England Conference. In 1856
          he was sent to India to be superintendent of a mission to be
          founded in that country. He located it in Oudh, Northwest India,
          but had scarcely begun work before the Sepoy rebellion broke out
          and he was for a time in extreme peril. Quiet being restored, he
          conducted the mission very successfully, making his headquarters
          at Bareilly. In 1865 he returned to America because, the mission
          being organized into a conference, no superintendent was needed.
          He resumed his pastoral labors till in 1869 he became secretary
          of the American and Foreign Christian Union, in New York. In
          1873 he was for the second time selected by his Church to found
          a mission, this time in Mexico, and was its superintendent till
          1879. He revisited India in 1883 and 1884, and saw the great
          success which had attended the mission he had founded. His last
          days were passed at Newton Centre, Mass. He wrote: Compendium of
          Missions (Boston, 1852); The Land of the Veda (New York, 1872);
          From Boston to Bareilly and Back (1885); Mexico in Transition
          (1892).

          n. of Raphoe), County Donegal, July 5, 1848. He studied at
          Trinity College, Dublin, and was professor of moral philosophy
          there from 1837 to his death. From 1837 to 1842 he was minister
          at Clondehorka, diocese of Raphoe, County Donegal, and then
          rector of Raymoghy in the same diocese. He was a brilliant and
          profound thinker, but his works are all posthumous and prepared
          for the press by others. They are Letters on the Development of

   Buttlar, Eva von
          BUTTLAR, EVA VON: The leader in a disgraceful aberration
          externally connected with Pietism, which is in no way
          responsible for it; b. at Eschwege (26 m. e.s.e. of Cassel),
          Hesse, 1670; d. at Altona after 1717. Educated without religious
          instruction, she married at seventeen a French dancing-master in
          Eisenach, named De Vésias. After ten years of a gay court life,
          she was touched by the Pietistic movement, left her husband,
          stopped going to church, and in 1702, with a group of friends,
          founded at Allendorf in Hesse a new Christian-Philadelphic
          society, like several others which had sprung up in the
          Netherlands and western Germany. The esoteric doctrine of these
          societies included the expectation of an approaching millennium,
          the rejection of marriage as degrading, and the extinction of
          carnal desires by unrestrained indulgence. Eva and her friends
          are said to have practised the most lawless excesses, as
          sanctioned by their beliefs. Driven from Allendorf, they sought
          refuge in Wittgenstein, the common asylum of the persecuted; but
          even there the tribunals were obliged to interfere. Eva and her
          special intimates, the theologian Winter and the physician
          Appenfeller, embraced Catholicism at Cologne pro forma as a
          means of protection, and then settled at Lüde near Pyrmont,
          where their blasphemous insanity reached its height in 1706.
          They were all again arrested, but escaped. Appenfeller, who had
          been legally married to Eva, settled with her in Altona as a
          practising physician; and she is said finally to have lived a
          decent, regular life with him there as a member of the
          Evangelical Lutheran Church.

    1. Early Activity in the Protestant Cause.

          Martin Butzer (Bucer) was born at Schlettstadt (26 m. s.w. of
          Strasburg) Nov. 11, 1491; d. at Cambridge, Eng., Feb. 28, 1551.
          He received his first education at the excellent Latin school of
          his native town, and in 1506 joined the order of the Dominicans.
          In 1517 he was at Heidelberg, where he studied the writings of
          the humanists, the Bible, and also the writings of Luther, whose
          personal acquaintance he made in 1518 and with whom he began to
          correspond in 1520. Being suspected by his order and accused at
          Rome, Butzer, who favored the evangelical cause, left the
          monastery in 1520 to avoid further difficulties, and became an
          associate of Hutten and Sickingen. The latter called him in 1522
          to the pastorate of Landstuhl, and in the same year he married,
          being one of the first priests to break his vow of celibacy.
          When Sickingen was defeated by the elector of Treves, however,
          Butzer had to leave the city, and for a year he acted as
          evangelical preacher at Wissenburg in Alsace, supported by the
          council and citizens, but attacked by the Franciscan monks. In
          1523 he went to Strasburg, where the Reformation, prepared in
          different ways, was already in progress. Together with Zell,
          Capito, and Hedio, Butzer became the soul of the Strasburg
          Reformation, and by preaching and writing, by letters and
          journeys, and by personal relations with ecclesiastics and
          statesmen, he exerted a reformatory and organizing activity, not
          only in Alsace but also in different countries. He was pastor of
          St. Aurelia 1524-31, and pastor of St. Thomas 1531-40, having
          already become in 1530 president of the newly founded church
          council which was the supreme ecclesiastical authority in
          Strasburg.

    2. The Reformation in Strasburg.

          As spiritual spokesman of the Strasburg citizens, who were eager
          for the Reformation, and as leader of the evangelical ministers,
          he appeared before the council, which proceeded cautiously and
          advisedly. He accomplished the abolition of the mass on Feb. 20,
          1529, by a decree of the lay assessors, and thus the
          introduction of the Reformation into the free imperial city
          Strasburg was made a matter of history. But long before this the
          reorganization of the divine service and of ecclesiastical life
          began. Butzer's Ordnung und Inhalt deutscher Messe (1524) was
          typical of the Reformed order of worship. He devoted special
          attention to catechetics and published three catechisms between
          1524 and 1544, while by the church ordinance of 1534 he
          introduced the lay presbytery into Strasburg, and in 1539 he
          inaugurated confirmation in the same city. Together with his
          friend Johannes Sturm, he laid the foundations of the Protestant
          educational system in Strasburg, founding the gymnasium in 1538,
          and the seminary in 1544. In the interest of ecclesiastical
          discipline he energetically opposed the Anabaptists and such
          radicals as Carlstadt, Hetzer, Denk, Sebastian Frank,
          Schwenckfeld, Melchior Hofmann, and Clemens Ziegler.

          Outside of Strasburg Butzer brought about the introduction of
          the Reformation into Hanau-Lichtenberg (1544), while
          Württemberg, Baden, and especially Hesse owed him much. For the
          elector of Cologne, Archbishop Hermann of Wied, Butzer, together
          with Melanchthon, composed an order of reformation (1543). His
          influence even reached as far as Belgium, Italy, and France.

    3. Endeavors to Reconcile Luther and Zwingli.

          Butzer's activity in ecclesiastical organization is treated too
          lightly in most works on church history, which lay their main
          stress on his efforts toward a union of the two main streams of
          the Reformation, and especially on his endeavors to reconcile
          Luther and Zwingli in the eucharistic controversy, which
          significantly interrupted the course of the main events in the
          period of the Reformation. When Carlstadt had to leave Strasburg
          in 1524, Butzer addressed a writing to Luther in the name of the
          Strasburg ministers, is which he and they expressed their
          position in regard to Carlstadt. Concerning the sacrament of the
          altar, they taught that the bread is the body of Christ and the
          wine his blood, but that greater importance should be attached
          to the commemoration of the death of Jesus than to the question
          what one eats and drinks. At first Luther answered reassuringly,
          but in his work Wider die himmlischen Propheten (1525) he
          attacked the Strasburg theologians. The latter sent an envoy to
          appease Luther, but he emphasized the bodily presence of Christ
          in the Lord's Supper more than ever, and gave the Strasburgers
          to understand that they should not be deceived by the light of
          reason. The Strasburgers now saw themselves driven more and more
          to the side of the Swiss, so far as the doctrine of the
          sacrament was concerned. At the [607]Disputation of Bern in 1528
          Butzer made the personal acquaintance of Zwingli, with whom he
          had been corresponding since 1523. Luther again attacked his
          opponents in his Grosses Bekenntnis vom Abendmahl (1528), but
          Butzer did not lose hope of coming to an understanding by a
          personal interview. Together with the landgrave Philip of Hesse,
          who was animated by the same interest in the union and agreement
          of the Protestants, he brought about the religious conference of
          [608]Marburg in 1529. Concerning the question whether the true
          body and blood of Christ are actually present in the bread and
          wine, no agreement could be reached; nevertheless, each party
          was to show Christian love toward the other, so far as the
          conscience of each allowed. Butzer visited Luther at Coburg in
          Sept., 1530, and received the promise to examine a new
          confession which Butzer intended to prepare. Butzer now
          endeavored to induce the Protestants, at least in southern
          Germany, to prepare a declaration which should approximately
          satisfy Luther, since the Swiss opposed every further advance,
          an additional incentive being the threatening attitude of the
          emperor toward the Protestants at this time.

    4. The Wittenberg Concord.

          The outcome of these endeavors was the [609]Wittenberg Concord,
          which was agreed upon with Luther in 1536 by a delegation of
          Upper German theologians under the direction of Butzer. In this
          Concord the concession was made to Luther that the body and the
          blood of Christ are truly and essentially present with the bread
          and with the wine and are so given and received, the only
          modification being that the unworthy, but not the unholy,
          actually receive the body of the Lord. By this agreement a
          certain sort of theological understanding was reached between
          Luther and the South Germans, but the rupture between Butzer and
          the Swiss was accomplished.

    5. Critique of Butzer's Attitude in the Controversy.

          Whatever views be held of Butzer's efforts for union, especially
          in the eucharistic controversy, his honest intention and his
          unselfish zeal to serve the Church are beyond all question. His
          diplomatic tactics were not always such as to inspire
          confidence, and they gave offense to other parties besides
          Luther. Butzer himself felt it afterward and honestly
          acknowledged that he had not always interfered in a discreet
          manner. The whole subject of controversy was of less interest
          for Butzer than for Luther, hence Butzer's readiness to make
          concessions and ever new formularizations. The real success of
          his endeavors was that the South Germans were not only induced
          to make common political cause with the North Germans, but were
          also drawn into the communion of Lutheranism, in spite of their
          peculiar doctrine of the Lord's Supper. The fact that
          Melanchthon, influenced partly by Butzer, took an intermediate
          position, and was thus drawn nearer to Calvin, was also
          far-reaching in its importance for the future formation of the
          Evangelical Church in Germany. The outcome of the Schmalkald War
          and the defeat of the Protestants (1547) gave the emperor power
          to settle the religious troubles by the Augsburg Interim (see
          [610]Interim) in 1548, which was accepted by the majority of the
          intimidated diet and was to be forced upon the city of
          Strasburg. This was most energetically opposed by Butzer and his
          younger colleague, Paul Fagius, on the ground of the Romanizing
          character of the document. But when the council, yielding to the
          force of circumstances, accepted the Interim, Butzer perceived
          that he could remain in Strasburg no longer, and he accepted a
          call to England, whither he had been invited, together with
          Fagius, by Thomas Cranmer, archbishop of Canterbury, the soul of
          the Reformation in England.

    6. Butzer in England.

          In Apr., 1549, both arrived at London, and were met by Cranmer
          and King Edward VI. The king wished them to translate the Bible
          from the original into Latin, this version being intended to
          serve as the basis of an English version for the people. The
          work was commenced at once. At the end of the summer of 1549
          Butzer and Fagius were to go to Cambridge as teachers and assist
          in the education of candidates for the ministry. Fagius arrived
          first, but died of a slow fever (Nov., 1549). In Jan., 1550,
          Butzer commenced his lectures at Cambridge, which were attended
          by large crowds of students, some of whom afterward exercised a
          powerful influence in the Anglican Church. Butzer was directed
          to examine the Book of Common Prayer, and was thus led into a
          public disputation held on Aug. 8, 1550, to expose the
          opposition of the English bishops (who still leaned toward Rome)
          to evangelical principles and innovations. At the request of the
          young king, Butzer wrote his De regno Christi, which he prepared
          in less than three months. This work was intended to teach the
          true nature of God's kingdom and the means by which it might be
          realized in earthly form in a country like England. This work
          was Butzer's last.

    7. Death of Butzer.

          Scarcely had the king expressed his warm approval and the
          university conferred the degree of doctor of divinity
          unconditionally, a thing which never happened before, when
          Butzer died after a short illness. He was buried with great
          honor in the principal church at Cambridge; but in 1556 his body
          was exhumed and publicly burnt. Four years afterward, however,
          Queen Elizabeth again honored his memory.

   Buxtorf
          BUXTORF: A family of scholars at Basel, noteworthy for their
          services in the study of the Old Testament and Hebrew language
          and literature.

          1. Johann Buxtorf the Elder: Orientalist; b. at Camen (8 m. s.w.
          of Hamm), Westphalia, Dec. 25, 1564; d. at Basel Sept. 13, 1629.
          He received his earliest education in the schools of Hamm and
          Dortmund, and then went to Marburg and Herborn, where he began
          his Hebrew studies under Piscator. Leaving Herborn, he studied
          successively at Heidelberg, Basel, Zurich, and Geneva, returning
          to Basel and taking his degree in 1590. In the following year,
          after much hesitation, he accepted the chair of Hebrew at the
          University of Basel, and later added other duties to this
          position, including the direction of the gymnasium. In 1610,
          however, he declined an appointment to a professorship of
          theology, as well as calls to Leyden and Saumur. Buxtorf was the
          greatest rabbinical student among the Protestants, availing
          himself not only of the Hebrew commentaries on the books of the
          Old Testament and the writings of learned Jews, but also
          carrying on an active correspondence with Jewish scholars in
          Germany, Poland, and Italy. His close relations with Jews,
          however, frequently exposed him to suspicion, and on one
          occasion he was fined 100 florins for attending the circumcision
          of a son of a Jew who resided in his house as his assistant in
          the printing of his Hebrew Bible. He devoted his Hebrew
          knowledge to the defense of the original text of the Old
          Testament against the Roman Catholics, who regarded the Vulgate
          and the Septuagint as the more reliable authorities, and also
          against the doubts cast upon it by such Reformers as Luther,
          Zwingli, and Calvin, his services being the more important in
          view of the necessity of appeal to the purity of the Hebrew text
          in Protestant polemics against Catholicism. His chief works are
          as follows: Manuale Hebraicum et Chaldaicum (Basel, 1602); Juden
          Schül (1603; Latin transl., Synagoga Juduica, by H. Germberg,
          Hanau, 1604); Lexicon Hebraicum et Chaldaicum (1607); De
          abbreviaturis Hebraicis (1613); Biblia Hebraica cum paraphrasi
          Chaldaica et commentariis rabbinorum (4 vols., 1618-19); and
          Tiberias, sive commentarius masorethicus (1620); but he did not
          live to complete his Concordantiæ Bibliorum Hebraicæ or his
          Lexicon Chaldaicum, Talmudicum et Rabbinicum, both of which were
          edited by his son (Basel, 1632, 1639).

          2. Johann Buxtorf the Younger: Orientalist; son of the
          preceding; b. at Basel Aug. 13, 1599; d. there Aug. 17, 1664.
          After receiving his first education from his father, he attended
          the high school of his native city, and in 1617 went to
          Heidelberg, where he remained two years, then going to Dort,
          where he attended the synod. After its conclusion he made a tour
          of Holland, England, and France, in company with the delegates
          of the city, and then returned to Basel. At the age of
          twenty-three he published his Lexicon Chaldaicum et Syriacum
          (Basel, 1622), and in the following year studied at Geneva, but
          declined a call to the professorship of logic at Lausanne,
          preferring to remain in his native city, where he served as a
          deacon from 1624 to 1630. Delicate health, however, obliged him
          to resign all hopes of becoming a preacher, and in 1630 he
          succeeded his father as professor of Hebrew. He declined calls
          to Groningen and Leyden, and in 1654 accepted the chair of Old
          Testament exegesis, as being closely associated with the one
          which he already held. It was his task to defend the views of
          his father on the purity of the transmitted Masoretic text of
          the Old Testament against many attacks, particularly by
          [611]Cappel, who assailed the credibility of rabbinical
          tradition and regarded the Hebrew text as inferior in places to
          the ancient versions. In this and kindred controversies Buxtorf
          wrote De punctorum, vocalium atque accentuum in libris Veteris
          Testamenti Hebraicis origine, antiquitate et auctoritate (Basel,
          1648), and Anticritica, seu vindiciæ veritatis Hebraicæ adversus
          Ludovici Cappelli criticam quam sacram vocat (1653), but though
          the logical victory rested with Cappel, who could appeal both to
          the judgment of [612]Elias Levita, who exercised a powerful
          influence on the development of Old Testament studies among the
          Protestants, and could also claim the support of many of the
          Reformers, he was regarded as a dangerous man, who sought to
          deny the divinity of the Scriptures, while his opponent was
          looked upon as a defender of orthodoxy, and won the formal
          verdict. In a minor controversy with Cappel on the Eucharist he
          wrote his Vindiciæ exercitationis Sanctæ Coenæ contra Cappellum
          (Basel, 1646) and his Anticritica contra Cappellum (1653). He
          likewise made a Latin translation of the Moreh Nebukim of
          Maimonides (Basel, 1629) and edited, with notes and a
          translation the Liber Cosri, sive colloquium de religione of
          Judah ha-Levi (1660).

          3. Johannes Jakob Buxtorf: Orientalist; son of the preceding; b.
          at Basel Sept. 4, 1645; d. there Apr. 1, 1704. He was educated
          at the university of his native city, and succeeded his father
          as professor of Hebrew in Nov., 1664. In the following year he
          received leave of absence and visited Geneva, France, Holland
          (wintering at Leyden), and London. The general suspicion of
          foreigners in London just after the great fire, however, caused
          Buxtorf to take refuge in a neighboring village, whence he later
          went to Oxford and Cambridge. In 1669 he returned to Basel and
          resumed his duties at the university, in addition to acting as
          librarian. Although regarded as an excellent scholar and a
          diligent student, he wrote little with the exception of a
          preface to his edition of his grandfather's Tiberias (Basel,
          1665), and his emendations to the Synagoga Judaica (1680).

          4. Johann Buxtorf: Nephew of the preceding; b. at Basel Jan. 8
          1663; d. there June 19, 1732. After completing his education at
          Basel, he went to Holland to continue his Oriental studies. In
          1694 he was appointed preacher at Aristdorf, a village near
          Basel, and in 1704 he succeeded his uncle as professor of Hebrew
          at the University, holding this position until his death. His
          most noteworthy book was his Catalecta philologico-theologica
          cum mantissa epistolarum virorum clarorum ad Johannem
          Buxtorffium patrem et filium scriptarum (Basel, 1707).

          BYFIELD, ADONIRAM: Puritan and Presbyterian; b. probably at
          Chester, before 1615, the son of [613]Nicholas Byfield; d. in
          London 1660. He was educated at Emmanuel College, Cambridge, and
          chosen chaplain to a regiment of Parliament's army in 1642. In
          1643 he was appointed one of the two scribes of the Westminster
          Assembly, but was not a member of that body. The manuscript
          minutes (edited by Mitchel and Struthers, 1874), now in the
          Williams Library, University Hall, Gordon Square, London, are in
          his handwriting. He also edited, by authority of Parliament, the
          various papers in the controversy between the Westminster
          Assembly and the Dissenting Brethren, published London, 1648,
          including Reasons Presented by the Dissenting Brethren against
          Certain Propositions concerning Presbyterian Government, The
          Answer of Assemby of Divines, Papers for Accumulation, and The
          Papers and Answers of the Dissenting Brethren and the Committee
          of the Assembly of Divines. He was rector of Fulham in Middlesex
          (1644?) and vicar of Fulham (1645?-1657), subsequently rector of
          Collingbourn-Ducis in Wiltshire.

   Byfield, Nicholas
          BYFIELD, NICHOLAS: Puritan and Presbyterian, b. in Warwickshire
          in 1579; d. at Isleworth (2 m. s. of Brentford), Middlesex,
          Sept. 8, 1622. He was educated at Exeter College, Oxford; was
          for seven years pastor of St. Peter's Church at Chester, when
          (1615) he became vicar of Isleworth in Middlesex, where he
          remained until his death. William Gouge describes him as "a man
          of a profound judgment, strong memory, sharp wit, quick
          invention, and unwearied industry." His works were numerous, and
          greatly esteemed. His Marrow of the Oracles of God (London,
          1620), containing six treatises previously published apart,
          reached an eleventh edition in 1640. The Principles, or, the
          Pattern of Wholesome Words, dedicated in 1618, reached a seventh
          edition in 1665, and is a valuable compend of divinity. His
          expository sermons on the Epistle to the Colossians were
          published 1615, and several series on the First Epistle of Peter
          at various times, finally collected and enlarged in a Commentary
          upon the Whole First Epistle of St. Peter (1637). The Rule of
          Faith, or an Exposition of the Apostles' Creed was issued by his
          son Adoniram, after his death (1626), and is an able and
          instructive work. He must be numbered among the Presbyterian
          fathers in England.

   Byrom, John
          BYROM, JOHN: Author of "Christians awake, salute the happy
          morn," a Christmas hymn in almost universal use in England; b.
          at Kersall Cell, Broughton, near Manchester, Feb. 29, 1692; d.
          there Sept. 26, 1763. He entered Trinity College, Cambridge,
          1708 (B.A., 1712; M.A., 1715), and became fellow, 1714;
          contributed to the Spectator; invented a system of shorthand and
          taught it with success; became F.R.S., 1724; succeeded to the
          family estate at Kersall, 1740, and spent his later years there.
          He was a mystic and a Jacobite; took deep interest in religious
          speculations, and knew most of the celebrities of his time; he
          wrote some of the best epigrams in the language. His Poems,
          written in easy, colloquial style for his own and his friends'
          amusement, were printed posthumously (2 vols., Manchester, 1773;
          again, with life and notes, London, 1814); the Chetham Society
          of Manchester has published his Private Journal and Literary
          Remains, ed. R. Parkinson (2 vols., 1854-1857), and the Poems,
          ed. A. W. Ward (2 vols., 1894-1895).

          BYRUM, ENOCH EDWIN: American clergyman and editor of The Church
          of God; b. near Union City, Ind., Oct. 13, 1861. He was educated
          in the public schools, and also studied elocution and oratory in
          the Northern Indiana Normal School (1886) and Sunday-school work
          in Otterbein University (1887). He was ordained a minister of
          "The Church of God" in 1892, and in addition to editing The

          Relation of the Cabala to Christianity (§ 20).

          The term Cabala designates the esoteric doctrines of Judaism.
          Although it claims to be a product of the tannaitic period and
          to be the work of such sages as Ishmael ben Elisha, Simeon ben
          Yoh?ai, and Neh?unya ben ha-K?anah, modern investigation has
          proved that it is purely a product of the Middle Ages. Nor does
          the name k?abbalah (from k?ibbel, "to receive") occur with this
          special connotation before the thirteenth century, the term
          k?abbalah denoting in the Talmud the Hagiography and the
          Prophets in contradistinction to the Torah, or Pentateuch.

    1. Origin and Spread of the Cabala.

          The Cabala originated at a period when a crassly anthropomorphic
          concept of God prevailed in Judaism. In Maimonides rationalism
          had reached its climax, the literal meaning alone being
          accepted, while all allegorical interpretation was rejected. The
          study of the Talmud had become purely legalistic, and worship
          had degenerated into formalism. Against this stereotyped faith
          born of Aristotelianism arose a reaction, the Cabala. This
          sought to give the soul the nourishment it craved by an esoteric
          interpretation of the Scriptures, vivid presentation, and
          dramatic narrative, even though, in its speculative fervor, it
          became involved only too often in hopeless haze, and evoked a
          dark superstition through its juggling with the names of God.
          Arising in Provence, the reaction against rationalism passed to
          Spain, the real home of the Cabala. Thence, with the expulsion
          of the Spanish Jews, it was carried to Palestine, whence it
          spread throughout Europe. The fundamental doctrines of the
          Cabala are derived from the Hellenistic Judaism, Neo-platonism,
          and Neo-Pythagoreanism, with occasional traces of Gnosticism.
          These elements are so interwoven, however, with the Bible and
          with a midrashic method of presentation, that the whole has been
          stamped with the seal of Judaism.

    2. Doctrine of God.

          According to the Cabala, God is the eternal and boundless
          principle of all, and is therefore called En Sof ("The
          Infinite"). The attributes given him are general, rather than
          specific. He is absolutely perfect, and is free from all
          blemish; he is unity and immutability; he is boundless and
          naught exists beside him; and since he may be known neither by
          wisdom nor by understanding, no definition can be given of him,
          no concept be formed regarding him, and no question asked
          concerning him. To all beings he is the concealed of all
          concealed, the hidden of all hidden, the ancient of the ancient;
          the first of all first and the primal principle.

    3. Creation and the Sefiroth.

          The cardinal cosmogonic doctrine of the Cabala is creation e
          nihilo. The reconciliation of the imperfect and transitory
          phenomenal world with the perfection and immutability of God,
          and the mutual relation of the two formed never-ending problems
          for the cabalists. To explain the riddle they assumed the
          existence of a series of independent and spiritual primeval
          potentialities, which were intelligible substances or demiurges
          emanating from the deity. These demiurges (sefiroth) are
          mentioned as early as the Sefer Yez?irah, where their number is
          given as ten. According to this work, the first emanation was
          the spirit of the living God, from which proceeded the entire
          phenomenal world. This same spirit, furthermore, caused ether,
          water, and fire to emanate from each other. From ether arises
          the intellectual world, from water the material (the tohu
          wa-bohu of Gen. i. 2), and from fire the spiritual (the angels
          and the throne of God). These four sefiroth are followed by the
          six bounds of space, height, depth, east, west, north, and
          south. There is, however, no consistent view concerning the
          nature of the sefiroth, which are sometimes regarded as
          intermediaries between God and the visible world, and at other
          times as the manifestations of the powers and properties of God;
          and there is an equal divergence of opinion as to whether they
          are actual creations which form, in a sense, the basis of later
          creations, or emanations whereby God emerges from his
          concealment and assumes form. All attempts to reconcile these
          conflicting views by postulating the existence of God both in
          and above phenomena proved unsuccessful. The issuance of the
          sefiroth from God was regarded by the cabalists as imperiling
          the doctrine of his immutability and infinity. The first
          difficulty was obviated by the hypothesis that God's design to
          manifest himself had existed from all eternity. Since, however,
          God in his infinity filled the entire universe, no room was left
          for the sefiroth, until Moses ben Jacob Cordovero (1522-70) and
          Isaac Luria (1533-72) postulated two concentrations, one a
          contraction and the other a retraction. Many cabalists, however,
          felt themselves unable to accept this theory of concentration,
          which was closely connected, moreover, with the Gnosticism of
          Valentinian and Basilides, and preferred to assume that the
          emergence of God from his retirement was to be understood in
          terms of concept rather than of space, and some regarded the
          entire process as metaphorical.

    4. Names of the Sefiroth.

          The first sefirah was Kether ("Crown"), the primal source of all
          existence. The second was H?okmah (" Wisdom"), which, though
          enveloped in God, generated the ideas. The third was Binah
          ("Intelligence"), which carries out the ideas of eternal Wisdom.
          The fifth was H?esedh ("Love"; sometimes called (Gedhulah,
          "Magnitude"), the fifth Din ("Law"; also called Gebhurah,
          "Might," or Pah?adh, "Fear"), the sixth Tifereth ("Beauty"; also
          called Rah?amim, "Mercy"), the seventh Nez?ah ("Firmness"), the
          eighth Hodh ("Splendor"), and the ninth Yesodh the
          ("Foundation"). The tenth sefirah was Malkhuth ("Kingdom"; also
          called Shekhinah, "Royalty"), and was united in marriage with
          the God who rules the world. The number of the sefiroth was
          doubtless influenced by the fact that astronomy then postulated
          the existence of ten spheres, and also by the sanctity ascribed
          to the number ten.

    5. Triads of Sefiroth.

          As early as the eleventh century Hai Gaon (998-1038) classified
          the ten primal potentialities into two groups, the first
          including three which produced the spiritual world, and the
          second comprising two triads which were united by a seventh, and
          these formed the source of the material world. The main outlines
          of this classification were retained by later cabalists. Azriel
          (1160-1238) distinguished three groups--intellectual, spiritual,
          and material, a classification evidently due to Neoplatonic
          influence. Each group forms a triad, and its members stand in
          the mutual relation of thesis, antithesis, and synthesis. The
          first two members, moreover, sustain a polar relation to each
          other, and are united by the third. Thus, in the first triad,
          which consists of "Crown," "Wisdom," and "Intelligence,"
          "Intelligence" forms the connecting link. In the second triad,
          which consists of "Love," "Law," and "Beauty," "Beauty" (or
          "Mercy") forms the bond of union, while in the third triad of
          "Firmness," "Splendor," and "Foundation," the last reconciles
          the first two. All three triads are subject to the tenth
          sefirah, "Kingdom," which binds them into a harmonious whole.
          The first triad, moreover, contained the "authors of the plan of
          the world," the second the "arrangers," and the third the
          "creators." Although the sefiroth are by no means comparable
          with God and do not condition his independence, they partake of
          his infinity and transmit his streams of blessings to the
          various worlds. For this purpose, on which their existence and
          activity depend, they are united with God by invisible canals
          (z?innoroth) which proceed from the throne of the divine
          majesty.

          In so far as the sefiroth are the earliest manifestations of
          God, they form an ideal world which bears no relation to the
          material world, and in this aspect they are termed either
          "primeval man" (adham k?adhmon) or "superman" (adham 'ilai), who
          is sometimes considered to be the sefiroth collectively, and
          sometimes regarded as the first manifestation whereby God
          revealed himself as the creator and ruler of the world. In this
          aspect he seems to be a revelation interposed between God and
          the universe, and thus a second god, as it were, or the Logos.

    6. The Four Worlds.

          According to a later view, various grades of emanation produced
          four worlds, in each of which the ten sefiroth were repeated.
          The first of these was the 'Olam ha-Az?ilah ("World of
          Radiation"), which contains the powers of the divine plan of the
          worlds. These powers have the same nature as the world of the
          sefiroth or the Adham k?adhmon, while, according to the Zohar,
          it also contains the throne of the Shekinah and God's mantle of
          light. From the 'Olam ha-Az?ilah emanated the 'Olam ha-Beriah
          ("World of Creation"), the home of the organizing powers and
          potencies. There were the treasuries of blessing and life, and
          there was the throne of the glory of God, as well as the halls
          of all spiritual and moral perfection, where the souls of the
          righteous dwelt. In its turn, the 'Olam ha-Beriah produced the
          'Olam ha-Yez?irah ("World of Creation") with the angels and
          Met?at?ron as their chief. To him are subject the evil spirits
          (k?elifoth, "husks"), who dwell in the planets and other
          heavenly bodies, or in the ether. The fourth world is the
          present material and phenomenal 'Olam ha-'Assiyah ("World of
          Action"), which is subject to constant change and delusion. Like
          the sefiroth, the four worlds are closely connected with God as
          the primal principle, and receive continual streams of divine
          blessing. This cosmology of four worlds is based on the
          theophany of Ezek. i. and seems to be first mentioned in the
          Massekheth Az?iluth, a small treatise of the first half of the
          thirteenth century. The anthropomorphic tendencies of the
          cabalists led them to make distinctions of sex among the
          sefiroth. The masculine principle, which is white in color,
          appears chiefly in "Love," although it underlies both the other
          two sefiroth of the right side ("Wisdom" and "Firmness"); while
          the passive red female principle, which owes its existence to
          the male, dwells chiefly in "Law," yet also forms the basis of
          the other sefiroth of the left side ("Intelligence" and
          "Splendor").

    7. Origin of Evil.

          Side by side with the heavenly sefiroth exist the sefiroth of
          evil, and Adham k?adhmon, in like manner, has his counterpart in
          Adham Beliyya'al. The realms are related to each other as the
          right and the left wing. In the kingdom of evil, as in the realm
          of good, there are ten grades. Under the leadership of Samael
          and his queen, the great adulteress, the dark sefiroth toil
          unceasingly for the destruction of the world. Since, however,
          the sefiroth of darkness, like the sefiroth of light, were
          regarded as emanations, there was danger that the Infinite might
          be considered the author of evil. To obviate this, the older
          cabalists advanced the hypothesis that the origin of evil was to
          be sought in the distances of the emanations from their divine
          author, since the further they went from God into the material
          world, the more degenerate they be came. The younger cabalists
          like Lucia, on the other hand, held that the vessels of the
          sefiroth were unable to contain and conduct the fulness of the
          divine blessing and burst, thus giving rise to evil. Penance,
          self-mortification, prayer, and rigid observance of the
          prescribed ceremonies, however, would gradually reconcile the
          upper and lower realms and restore the original harmony of the
          universe. It is noteworthy that this doctrine of the opposition
          of the two kingdoms is a late development of the Cabala, and
          that it was not fully developed until the thirteenth century.

    8. Doctrine of the Messiah.

          The Messianic teachings of the Cabala are closely connected with
          the doctrine of the realm of the evil sefiroth. When through
          their piety and virtue mankind shall steadily have diminished
          the kingdom of the k?elifoth, the Messiah will appear and
          restore all things to their original condition. Under his rule
          all will turn to the divine light, and idolatry will cease. In
          its account of the nature and task of the Messiah the Cabala
          diverges a little from the views advanced by the Talmud and the
          Midrash.

          In its anthropology the Cabala generally adopts the tenets of
          Talmudic and Gaonic mysticism, so that its new developments may
          be summarized briefly. Earthly man is a type of the prototype
          Adham k?adhmon, and thus comprises within himself all that the
          ideal creation contains. He is, therefore, a microcosm. The
          Cabala also teaches the dual nature of man, who consists of body
          and soul. Every member has its symbolic meaning, while the body,
          as the garment of the soul, typifies the merkabah (the heavenly
          Throne-Chariot of Ezek. i., x.). The soul, however, is far
          superior to the body, since it is derived from the divine
          all-soul, and through the "canals" (z?innoroth) can influence
          the intellectual world and draw down its blessings to the lower
          world. It appears under the three designations of nefesh, ruah?,
          and neshamah. The first is blind impulse, the second is the seat
          both of good and evil impulses, and the third is able to unite
          with God sad the kingdom of light.

    9. Doctrines of the Soul.

          The Cabala also teaches the pre-existence of the soul. All souls
          destined to enter human bodies have existed from all eternity in
          a fixed number, nourished by the sight of the divine radiance of
          the Shekinah. The entrance of the soul into a body is a
          misfortune, and it implores God to spare it such imprisonment.
          Before their entrance into human bodies souls are androgynous,
          while marriage unites the severed halves to a single whole. This
          doctrine, like the preceding, is reminiscent of Plato and Philo,
          as is the cabalistic doctrine that all earthly learning is but a
          reminiscence of what the soul had known before it came to earth.

    10. Metempsychosis.

          Of special interest is the cabalistic doctrine of reincarnation.
          Each soul which is united with a body is to undergo a period of
          trial in this world, and if it is found able to preserve its
          original purity it returns immediately at death to its place of
          heavenly origin. If, on the other hand, it falls into sin, it is
          subjected to a purification, and is obliged to remain in lower
          forms of existence, such as animals, trees, stones, and rivers,
          until it has fully atoned for its evil and has regained the
          purity requisite for its return to its celestial home.
          Occasionally, however, the sin-laden soul wanders in the world
          with its fellows, naked and ashamed, until it finally receives
          its purification in hell. New souls are seldom born, the greater
          number being reincarnations. This is a proof of the corruption
          of the human race, and though exalted spirits sometimes descend
          to earth for the welfare of man and assume human form, all the
          souls created from the beginning have not yet been able to be
          born on account of the number of reincarnations necessitated by
          human wickedness, and the Messiah consequently has not come.
          During sleep the souls of the righteous frequently leave their
          bodies, ascend to the celestial regions, hold converse with the
          spirits there, and receive revelations of future mysteries. Evil
          souls, on the other hand, descend to the realms of darkness and
          impurity and converse with demons, who give them false and lying
          words. To enable mankind to hold communication with the world of
          light during terrestrial existence, the cabalists exacted a
          scrupulous observance of the ceremonial law and, above all,
          prayer, to which was ascribed as influence over God himself.
          Among other agencies stress was laid on asceticism,
          flagellation, retirement from the world, the practise of all
          good works, the wearing of white garments, and the use of the
          phylacteries and the prayer-mantle.

    11. Mystic Biblical Exegesis of the Cabala.

          Aristotelian scholasticism gave rise in Judaism to a system of
          exegesis which resulted in a view of religion as a matter of the
          head, rather than the heart. Yet at this very time the
          increasing persecution of the Jews evoked a need for spiritual
          strength and revivification, and these requirements were met by
          the cabalistic opposition to the purely intellectual
          interpretation of the Bible and by the substitution of a new
          method of hermeneutics, which sounded the depths of the
          Scriptures and thus strengthened the sinews of religion. As
          early as the Talmudic and Mishnaic period the feeling had
          prevailed in certain quarters that in addition to the literal
          meaning of the Bible (peshat) there was an allegorical meaning
          (derush). The cabalists went still further, and regarded the
          letters, words, and names of the Bible as possessed of deeply
          hidden divine mysteries, while such accounts as those of Hagar,
          Esau, and Balak contained far more than mere history. They
          therefore laid little stress on the literal sense of the Bible,
          though not a letter might be added to it or taken from it. In
          their endeavor to unlock the divine mysteries they employed
          various systems of exegesis.

    12. Biblical Interpretation by Gematria.

          Of these the chief was the gemat?ria, or study of letters. As
          early as the Sefer Yez?irah the twenty-two letters of the Hebrew
          alphabet were divided according to sound, form, and numerical
          value. To the first class belonged the three "mothers," aleph,
          mem, and shin, which represented the three primal elements,
          aleph standing for air (awwer), mem for water (mayim), and shin
          for fire (esh). The seven "double" letters which formed the
          second division (beth, gimel, daleth, kaph, pe, resh, and taw)
          were symbolic of the seven planets, the seven days of the week,
          the seven gates of the soul, the seven seas, and the like; while
          in virtue of their twofold pronunciation, by either aspirated or
          unaspirated, they typified the seven antitheses of man: life and
          death, wisdom and folly, riches and poverty, peace and war,
          beauty and hideousness, fertility and desolation, power and
          slavery. The twelve "simple" letters, which constituted the
          remainder of the alphabet, symbolized the twelve activities of
          man: sight, hearing, smell, speech, eating, cohabitation, toil,
          walking, wrath, laughter, reflection, and sleep. The numerical
          value of the letters, moreover, rendered numbers sacred, so that
          twelve, for example, typified the twelve tribes, the twelve
          months, and the twelve signs of the zodiac. Subsequently
          gemat?ria was divided into arithmetical and figurative, the
          first considering the letters according to their numerical value
          and the latter devoted to the mode of writing the letters.

    13. Magic Powers of the Tetragrammaton.

          A second exegetical system was the not?arik?on, the acrostic use
          of the letters in such a way that each letter of a word formed
          the initial letter of a new word. The third method was z?iruf,
          the combination of letters, and the fourth was temurah, the
          creation of new words by the permutation and interchange of
          letters. The names of God were special subjects of cabalistic
          jugglery, since they were no longer the means whereby God had
          emerged from his concealment and become manifest to the
          understanding, but were now agencies to work upon the
          intelligible powers and to perform miracles of all kinds. The
          most marvelous powers were ascribed to the divine tetragrammaton
          YHWH. Whosoever possessed the true pronunciation of this name
          might come into relation with the upper world and receive
          revelations from the All-Soul. Each letter of the name was
          portentous. The yodh represented the Father as creator, and the
          double he the upper and lower Mother, while the waw typified the
          creation. Through permutation of the letters of the
          tetragrammaton was obtained a wealth of divine names, to which,
          in like manner, were ascribed miraculous powers. In the
          "practical" Cabala these new names played an important part,
          being used in formulas, amulets, and conjurations, their correct
          enunciation and the gestures with which they were spoken being
          leading factors in all these operations. In like manner, the
          twelve-lettered, twenty-two lettered, twenty-four-lettered, and
          seventy-two lettered name contained great mysteries, influenced
          the Supreme Being and averted threatening doom, while the names
          of the angels were subjected to similar manipulation. The net
          result was the total loss of any comprehension of the actual
          meaning of the text of the Bible.

    14. The Early Period of the Cabala.

          The history of the Cabala comprises a period of a thousand
          years, since its beginnings may be traced to the seventh
          century, while its last adherents belonged to the eighteenth.
          This lapse of time may be divided into two periods, the first
          from the seventh to the thirteenth century, and the second from
          the fourteenth to the eighteenth. From the seventh to the ninth
          century flourished the mysticism of the Merkabah, devoted to
          descriptions of "the great and small halls," and describing the
          throne of God and his court of angels according to Byzantine
          models. God the Infinite, the sefiroth, and transmigration are
          still unknown, and the authority cited on all occasions is the
          Tanna Ishmael ben Elisha, who flourished in the first and second
          centuries A.D. The juggling with the alphabet is represented by
          the "Alphabet of Rabbi Akiba," which treats of the letters
          according to name and form, and connects them with all manner of
          moral and religious teachings.

    15. The Sefer Yezirah.

          With the appearance of the Sefer Yez?irah ("Book of Creation")
          in the eighth century, the mystery of the Throne-Chariot gave
          place to the mystery of the creation, and a cosmogonic element
          was introduced which increased steadily in importance in the
          subsequent period. Here the doctrine of emanation appears in the
          form in which it had originated in Alexandria. The twenty-two
          letters are connected, moreover, with the ten divine emanations,
          and thus form the thirty-two paths of esoteric wisdom and
          constitute the basis of all things. God is not only the creator,
          but also the sustainer and ruler of the world. The letters of
          the alphabet are "real powers" which underlie all phenomena,
          while their permutation and their evaluation, like their
          connotation, are of importance. The Sefer Yez?irah is the
          earliest work which unites cabalistic speculation in a
          systematic whole. According to it there are four basal
          principles, emanating in order from each other--spirit, spirits,
          primeval water, and primeval fire, all united by the three
          dimensions and their antitheses into a decade. All things are in
          continual flux, dissolving old combinations and forming new
          ones, while throughout phenomena rules the law of antitheses,
          which are united by the mean between them. A remarkable work of
          the same period is the Sefer Raziel, which teaches the influence
          of the planets and the figures of the zodiac on the earth. The
          angel Raziel here takes the place of Met?at?ron, the angel of
          the presence, as he who possesses and communicates astrological
          and astronomical mysteries.

    16. Crystallization of the Cabala.

          In the thirteenth century the crystallization of the Cabala
          began and the doctrine of the sefiroth was fully developed. To
          the same period probably belongs the composition of the
          "Luminous Book," also called the "Midrash of Neh?unya ben
          ha-K?anah," which teaches the main outlines of metempsychosis,
          while the ten divine emanations, which are not yet called
          sefiroth, but ma'amarim ("commands"), appear as categories
          possessed of creative force and connected with the attributes of
          God. A tendency toward visionary prophecy was impressed upon the
          Cabala by Abraham ben Samuel Abulafia (d. about 1304), who laid
          special stress on a knowledge of the divine name as determined
          by the exegetical methods of gemat?ria, not?arik?on, z?iruf, and
          temurah, while his pupil Joseph ben Abraham Gikatilla devoted
          himself to the mysteries of the alphabet, which he brought into
          close association with the doctrine of the sefiroth. The
          cabalistic speculation begun by Isaac the Blind reached its
          climax in the Zohar, apparently written by Moses ben Shem-Tob of
          Leon (d. 1305). If the Sefer Yez?irah be called the Mishnah of
          the Cabala, the Zohar is its Talmud. Ostensibly it is a
          midrashic commentary on the pericopes of the Pentateuch, but
          practically it is filled with a mass of cabalistic and other
          mystical speculations, and with allegorism run mad, especially
          concerning the names of God, the accents, and the vowel-points.
          In like manner, the kingdom of evil, with its demons and evil
          spirits which continually oppose the realm of righteousness, is
          described in terms of wildest fantasy. Its statements are placed
          in the mouth of Simeon ben Yohai, a Tanna of the second century
          A.D., who, according to the Talmud, lived in association with
          the angel Met?at?ron, who communicated to him the divine
          mysteries. Yet it is by no means a uniform work, among its older
          components being the "Book of Mystery," which is devoted to the
          creation and the events which preceded it; the "Great Holy
          Assembly," which forms a compend of cabalistic speculation and
          finds the type of all sefiroth in man, through whose mental
          processes the upper world of light is united with the lower
          world of sense, while the authropomorphisms of the Old Testament
          are declared to be mere metaphors; and the "True Shepherd,"
          which explains the nature of the primal emanations.

    17. The Zohar.

          The later elements of the Zohar are as follows: the "Small Holy
          Assembly," which gives a clearer exposition of the subjects
          treated in the "Great Holy Assembly"; the "Book of the Mystery
          of Mysteries," devoted to physiognomy and cheiromancy; the "Book
          of the Halls," which describes the abodes of the souls in the
          Garden of Eden and in hell; the "Hidden Midrash," which recounts
          the return of the souls to their new and perfect human forms
          after the resurrection, and portrays the meal prepared for the
          righteous; the "Ancient," which describes the transmigration of
          souls and the punishments of hell; the "Young," an exposition of
          various cabalistic teachings; and "Mishnas and Tosefta," which
          is devoted chiefly to the mystical meanings of the divine names.
          Despite the opposition of Talmudists and philosophers the Zohar
          gained an enormous following and was regarded as a revelation
          from heaven. Through it Spain became the real home of the
          Cabala, and even to the present day it is considered
          authoritative in some Judaistic quarters.

    18. Closing Period of the Cabala.

          With the exile of the Jews from Spain the Cabala was carried
          into all lands, and Safed in Palestine became its new center.
          There, in the sixteenth century, Moses ben Jacob Cordovero and
          Isaac Luria systematized the Cabala and filled many a gap which
          had existed in the Zohar, the former emphasizing the
          metaphysical and speculative, and the latter the ascetic and
          ethical side. Through them the Zohar was well-nigh deified, and
          in a like spirit many cabalists of the seventeenth century, such
          as Shabbathai Zebi and Jacob Frank, proclaimed themselves
          prophets or asserted that the Shekinah or the soul of the
          Messiah had become incarnate in them. From this time on,
          however, the Cabala has steadily declined, and the names of its
          representatives are too unimportant to require mention here.

    19. Influence of the Cabala on Judaism.

          Though the Cabala was devoted to a spiritualization of religion,
          the pagan elements which it adopted brought to Judaism a view of
          the universe which was entirely foreign to it, and worked it
          grave injury. The Biblical concept of a monotheistic God was
          superseded by a vague Gentile theory of emanation with a
          pantheistic tendency, and the doctrine of the unity of God was
          thrust into the background by the ten sefiroth, who were
          regarded as divine in essence. Since prayer was no longer
          addressed immediately to God but to the sefiroth, a genuine
          sefiroth-cult was evolved. The Talmud and philosophy were
          disdained by the cabalists, and even the study of the Bible was
          neglected, since it was no longer read for its own sake, but
          solely with the aid of cabalistic methods of hermeneutics. Nor
          did the ritual escape change and mutilation, and the
          phylacteries and the prayer-mantles were now put on to the
          accompaniment of various cabalistic formulas, especially
          prominent being the prayers to the sefiroth. Worst of all was
          the growth of superstition. That the soul might attain to the
          realm of light after death, the severest mortification of the
          flesh was practised, while the mysterious names of God were
          believed to heal the sick and quench the flames, and God altered
          his divine will at the prayer of the cabalist. The very kingdom
          of dankness was subject to the proper formulas of prayer, and
          the damned were freed from their torments by use of the magic
          names of God.

    20. Relation of the Cabala to Christianity.

          During the period of the Reformation the Cabala attracted wide
          attention because of the alleged kinship and agreement of its
          doctrines with the dogmas of the Christian Church. The opinion
          accordingly prevailed that it formed the means by which Judaism
          and Christianity might easily be united, especially as it was
          believed to contain the doctrines of the Trinity, the Messiah as
          the Son of God, and his work of atonement. In his missionary
          zeal for the Saracens in the thirteenth century [614]Raymond
          Lully considered the Cabala a divine revelation, and after the
          converted Jew Paulus de Heredia (about 1480) had shown in his
          "Letter of Secrets" that all the chief truths of Christianity
          were contained in the Cabala, Christian scholars became rivals
          in their eagerness to study esoteric Judaism. In 1486 Pico de
          Mirandola published at Rome his Septuaginta-duæ conclusiones
          cabballisticæ, and invited all scholars to Rome to attend a
          disputation to convince themselves of the kinship between the
          Cabala and Christianity. The first German to investigate this
          subject was Reuchlin, who devoted to it his De verbo mirifico
          (Basel, 1494) and his De arte cabbalistica (Hagenau, 1517).
          Latin translations of various portions of cabalistic works were
          made by Baruch of Benevento at the request of Cardinal Ægidius
          of Viterbo and by the convert Paul Riccio, physician in ordinary
          to the emperor Maximilian I., but the most important work which
          sought the truths of Christianity in the Cabala and gave
          translations from it was the Kabbala denudata of Christian Knorr
          von Rosenroth (4 vols., Sulzbach and Frankfort, 1677-84), the
          source for all subsequent scholars.

          It is now recognized that the concepts of God and the creation
          are entirely divergent in the Cabala and Christianity; the first
          triad of the sefiroth does not actually correspond to the
          Trinity, nor does the Christian doctrine of Christ as the Son of
          God find an analogue in the Adham kadhmon of the Cabala.
          According to Christianity, redemption is possible only through
          Christ, while the Cabala postulates that man can save himself by
          his mystic influence on God and the world of light through rigid
          observance of the law, asceticism, and similar agencies.

   Cadman, Samuel Parkes
          CADMAN, SAMUEL PARKES: Congregationalist; b. at Wellington (30
          m. n.w. of Birmingham), Shropshire, England, Dec. 18, 1864. He
          was educated at Richmond College, London, graduating in theology
          and classics in 1889, and held successive Methodist pastorates
          at Millbrook, N. Y. (1890-1893), Yorkers, N. Y. (1893-95), and
          the Metropolitan Temple, New York City (1895-1900). He then
          became pastor of the Central Congregational Church, Brooklyn.
          His theological position is that of a liberal-conservative.

   Cadoc
          CADOC (Cadocus, Docus): A Welsh saint, called "the Wise," son of
          a chieftain of South Wales and cousin of St. David of Menevia;
          d., according to one account, at his monastery of Llancarven
          (near Cowbridge, 10 m. w.s.w. of Llandaff, Glamorganshire),
          according to others, as a martyr at Beneventum, 570(?). He early
          devoted himself to the religious life, refused to succeed his
          father in his principality, studied under Irish scholars at
          home, and visited Ireland, Scotland, Rome, and Jerusalem in
          quest of instruction. He founded the monastery at Llancarven and
          made it a famous center of learning. Tradition associates him
          with David and Gildas (who was one of the teachers at
          Llancarven) as training the "second order of Irish Saints" (see
          [616]Celtic Church in Britain and Ireland, II, 2, § 1) and thus
          influencing the church life of Ireland. One of the earliest
          monuments of the Welsh language is The Wisdom of Cadoc the Wise,
          a collection of proverbs, maxims, and the like (in The Myvyrian
          Archaiology of Wales, ed. O. Jones, E. Williams, and W. O. Pugh,
          iii., London, 1807; new ed., Denbigh, 1870, 754 sqq.). The
          Fables of Cadoc the Wise maybe found in Iolo Manuscripts, ed. E.
          Williams (London, 1848).

   Cædmon
          CÆDMON: The first Christian poet of England and, with the
          exception of [618]Cynewulf, the only Anglo-Saxon versifier whose
          name is known; d. about 680. All information concerning him
          comes from Bede, who states (Hist. eccl., iv. 24) that he was a
          brother in Hilda's monastery at Streanæshalch (see [619]Hilda,
          Saint) and learned the art of song, not from men, but from God.
          Till well advanced in years he lived a secular life, and he
          often left a merry company where all were called on to sing in
          turn, feeling his inability to comply. On one such occasion he
          went from the hall to the stable, it being his duty that night
          to watch the animals, and in his sleep he saw some one standing
          before him and commanding him to sing of the Creation--which he
          thereupon was enabled to do, reciting an original poem, which
          Bede gives in Latin translation. [6] On awaking Cædmon
          remembered the poetry of his dream, and proceeded to add more of
          the same purport. Being brought before the abbess Hilda, he
          related his vision, and, at the request of the learned men there
          present, put passages of Scripture which they repeated to him
          into excellent verse. Thereupon he was received into the
          monastery and instructed in the Biblical stories, large portions
          of which he subsequently versified. Among these were the
          creation of the world, the origin of man, and the whole history
          of Genesis; the departure of the children of Israel from Egypt
          and their entrance into the land of promise; the incarnation,
          passion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ; the descent of
          the Holy Ghost and the preaching of the apostles; the terror of
          future judgment, the horror of hell, and the blessedness of
          heaven; and many other things by which he sought to lead men
          from the love of the world and to the choice of a good life. He
          was a very religious man and the manner of his death was in
          complete accord with his devout and tranquil life. Bede was born
          before Cædmon's death and lived not far from his monastery;
          hence his account is worthy of belief. The attempt of Sir
          Francis Palgrave to show that the story is a mere monk's tale is
          to be rejected. No doubt a monk named Cædmon lived at
          Streanæshalch and wrote poetry there, and evidently he was of
          low origin and unlearned. Several poems from a manuscript now in
          the Bodleian Library--a paraphrase of Genesis of more than 2,900
          lines; Exodus, about 600 lines; Daniel, about 800 lines; and
          portions of the New Testament, including the lament of the
          fallen angels, Christ's visit to hell, and the temptation of
          Christ, formerly known as the Christ and Satan--were published
          by Franciscus Junius (François du Jon) at Amsterdam in 1655 and
          attributed to Cædmon. At present it is conceded that only the
          first of these poems has any claim to be considered the
          production of Cædmon, and that even this has been transmitted in
          an interpolated and much modified form (see [620]Heliand, the,
          and the Old-Saxon Genesis); many think that it contains no work
          of Cædmon's at all. The hymn mentioned by Bede, however, is
          preserved in the Northumbrian dialect (Cædmon's own) by a
          Cambridge manuscript of the Historia ecclesiastica and is the
          oldest extant Christian poem in a Germanic tongue.

   Cærularius, Michael
          CÆRULARIUS, MICHAEL: Patriarch of Constantinople 1043-58. The
          exact date and place both of his birth and death are unknown,
          and few details of his life are certain. During the reign of
          Michael the Paphlagonian (1034-41) he was banished for
          conspiracy, but he was raised to the patriarchate by Constantine
          Monomachus, who hoped to find in him a firm ally. Cærularius,
          however, strenuously defended the rights of the Church, and his
          chief importance is due to the fact that his course resulted in
          the complete cleavage between the Greek and Roman Churches. At
          the very time when the Norman War gave the Byzantine court and
          the pope an opportunity to draw more closely together, the
          patriarch violently suppressed the Latin ritual observed in many
          cloisters and churches, and renewed the ancient charges of
          [622]Photius in a letter to the bishop of Trani in Apulia,
          reserving his special attack for the Roman use of unleavened
          bread in the Sacrament, which he condemned as Jewish. Leo IX
          replied with a haughty defense of the primacy of Rome, and at
          Constantine's request an embassy was sent to Constantinople,
          headed by the Cardinal Bishop Humbert. Their letters were
          intended to win over the emperor and humble the patriarch, and
          the feeble Constantine, overawed by Humbert's attacks on the
          Greek Church, had neither the courage to protect Cærularius nor
          to oppose him openly. The patriarch, however, refused to yield,
          and on July 16, 1054, the embassy excommunicated him and all his
          adherents. After the departure of the envoys, Cærularius
          regained his prestige with Constantine, and maintained it during
          the reign of Theodora. Isaac Comnenus, on the other hand,
          banished him on account of his arrogance in 1058, and he seems
          to have died shortly afterward. In addition to the letters
          already mentioned, Cærularius was the author of some decretals
          (De episcoporum judiciis, De nuptiis in septimo gradu non
          contrahendis, De sacerdotis uxore adulterio polluta; edited by
          Rhalles and Potlis, "Collection of Canons," v. 40-47) and a few
          writings still preserved in manuscript (De missa, Opus contra
          Latinos; listed by Fabricius, Bibliotheca Græca, ed. Harles, xi.
          195-197).

   Cæsarius of Arles
          CÆSARIUS OF ARLES: Bishop of Arles; b. at Châlon-sur-Saône (33
          m, n. of Mâcon) 469 or 470; d. at Arles (44 m. n.w. of
          Marseilles) Aug. 27, 542.

    Early Life.

          Little is known of his life before his eighteenth year, but at
          the age of twenty he went to the famous cloister on the island
          of Lérins, although it was now declining under the weak abbot
          Porcarius. There Cæsarius became acquainted with the writings of
          Faustus, who had been abbot of Lérins for some thirty years, and
          these works exercised an influence on him throughout his life.
          Porcarius appointed him master of the refectory, but the
          discontent of the monks caused his removal, and he thereupon
          devoted himself so rigidly to fasting that it became necessary
          to send him to Arles in search of health. He there became
          acquainted with Firminus, and at his request began the study of
          rhetoric with Pomerius of Africa, who is now generally regarded
          as identical with the author of the De vita contemplativa.
          Pomerius was, moreover, a follower of Augustine, and seems to
          have won his pupil over to this teacher. Recognizing in Cæsarius
          a fellow countryman and kinsman, Æontius, bishop of Arles, not
          only ordained him and placed him in charge of a monastery, but
          also induced the clergy, citizens, and king to appoint him his
          successor. In 502, therefore, Cæsarius became bishop of Arles,
          though sorely against his will.

    Bishop, 502.

          His first measure was to make daily attendance at church
          agreeable to the laity, largely by singing, and he also required
          them to learn passages from the Bible, in addition to the Creed
          and the Lord's Prayer. The administration of funds was entrusted
          to laymen and deacons, and he strove to maintain firm
          discipline, being apparently the author of the first Occidental
          manual of ecclesiastical law, the Statuta ecclesiæ antiqua. In
          505 Cæsarius was charged with high treason by his secretary
          Licinianus, and was banished to Bordeaux by Alaric II., although
          he quickly proved his innocence and was permitted to return. On
          Sept. 11, 506, he resumed the long interrupted series of Gallic
          synods with the [623]Synod of Agde, and the canons, evidently
          written by Cæsarius, are important documents for ecclesiastical
          history. Particularly noteworthy among them are the resolutions
          on ecclesiastical jurisdiction, slavery, celibacy, and
          church-property which was to be regarded as set aside for the
          poor. The death of Alaric shortly after the close of the synod
          ended the kingdom of Toulouse, and in 508 the Franks and
          Burgundians began the siege of Arles. A relative of the bishop
          deserted to the enemy, and Cæsarius himself was charged with
          treason and imprisoned, escaping only when the treason of the
          Jews who had accused him became known. In 510 the city was
          relieved, and Cæsarius cared for the captives without regard to
          creed, in addition to ransoming many with the money and
          ornaments of the churches. Three years later, however, he was
          cited to appear before Theodoric at Ravenna, probably because of
          his expenditures of church funds for the foundation of a nunnery
          at Arles and similar purposes, but he won the king completely to
          his side, and received such rich gifts from all quarters for the
          ransom of Burgundian captives that he was able to bring to Arles
          8,000 solidi (about $56,000). From Ravenna he went to Rome, and
          in October gave the pope a petition, in which he requested
          permission to employ church funds for cloisters; to abrogate, in
          view of the lack of clergy in Gaul, the hieratic cursus honorum,
          on which strict stress was laid at Rome; and also asked
          information regarding the marriage of widows and nuns, bribery
          in the election of bishops, and the prohibition against naming a
          bishop without the knowledge of the metropolitan. On Nov. 6,
          513, the petition was granted with a few reservations, Symmachus
          allowing only the usufruct to be devoted to cloisters and the
          like.

    Synods after 523.

          Little is known of the life of Cæsarius between 514 and 523,
          although the canons of the Council of Gerunda in 516-517 show
          that his influence was traceable in Spain. In 523, however, it
          became possible for him to exercise his metropolitan functions,
          since the peaceable intervention of Theodoric in the
          Franko-Burgundian War brought ten cities of Burgundy under the
          sway of the Ostrogoths. Cæsarius now held five synods: Arles,
          524; Carpentras, 527; Orange and Vaison, 529; and Marseilles,
          533. The disciplinary and legislative activity of Cæsarius
          accordingly lies in the Statuta ecclesiæ antiqua and in the
          canons of the six synods, to which should probably be added the
          decrees of what is commonly considered the second synod of
          Arles. Stress should also be laid on his care for the rural
          communities and for the erection of schools for the education of
          the clergy. As early as the Statuta, moreover, Cæsarius had
          taken for granted the right and duty of preaching, and he
          insisted on it again in the Admonitio, which seems to have
          appeared at the synod of Vaison. The Council of Orange (June 3,
          529) was the only one devoted to a dogmatic question, and also
          the only one which received papal sanction as an ecumenical
          council. This was apparently the conference of bishops of Vienne
          (mentioned in the Vita), who, as Semi-Pelagians, attacked the
          doctrine of grace taught at Arles, while Cyprian, bishop of
          Toulon, represented Cæsarius, who was prevented by illness from
          attending, and defended the dogma of prevenient grace. The
          epilogue of its resolutions, apparently written by Cæsarius
          himself, ascribes free will to all the baptized, and rejects
          predestination to damnation. His own position toward this
          problem first became clear in 1896, when Morin edited the
          treatise Quid dominus Cæsarius senserit contra eos qui dicunt
          quare aliis det Deus gratiam, aliis non det, in which he
          maintains that divine grace works without regard to the merits
          of man, while God acts according to his will and pleasure.

          The close of the second decade of the sixth century saw the
          climax of the activity of Cæsarius, and his relations with Rome
          changed for the worse. Pope Agapetus charged him with cruelty
          and injustice in his proceedings against Contumeliosus, bishop
          of Riez, although he had acted simply in accord with Gallican
          usage and had defended the discipline of the Church. Under Pope
          Vigilius he was obliged, as vicar of the Roman See, to render a
          decision in a question of marriage, which was disregarded. Old
          and sickly, he took no personal part in the French synods,
          although the ecclesiastical influence of his pupils remained
          important. He lived, however, to see the cloister which he had
          founded on Aug. 26, 512 or 513, in a flourishing condition, and
          to complete a bishopric of forty years.

    Works.

          No collected edition of the works of Cæsarius exists as yet,
          although the Benedictine Germaine Morin has long been preparing
          one, but the places in which his scattered writings may be found
          are given by Arnold, 435-450 (cf. 491-496), Malnory, v.-xviii.,
          and Fessler-Jungmann, 438, 452. In addition to the works already
          mentioned, his most important writings are his sermons. His
          chief sources, often noted in his manuscript, were Augustine,
          Rufinus, Faustus, Salvianus, and Eucherius, and his generosity
          in giving of his treasures to others has resulted in the
          ascription of many of his sermons to Augustine, Faustus, and
          similar authors. On the other hand, he prepared homiliaries,
          represented by Cod. Laon. 121 (ninth century) and Parisin. 10605
          fol. 71 (thirteenth century). A similar collection contains
          forty-two admonitions, and a third is devoted to sermons for the
          cloister. A special category is formed by the homilies for the
          Old Testament lessons for each fast, and these are supplemented
          by interpretations of texts of the New Testament. Another group
          of sermons is eschatological and a third is important for the
          history of penance. His monastery rules are extremely valuable
          for the history of asceticism, and his regulations for nuns,
          based on Augustine's letter Ad sanctimoniales, the so-called
          rules of Macarius, and his own monastic rules, received their
          final form in 534 and clearly show the various strata of their
          development. Of the other writings of Cæsarius, only the letters
          need be considered, for the Testamentum beati Cæsarii (MPL,

   Cæsarius of Heisterbach
          CÆSARIUS OF HEISTERBACH, h?is´ter-b??H: Monk; b. probably at
          Cologne c. 1180; d. at Heisterbach (20 m. s. of Cologne) c.
          1240. He received an excellent education at Cologne and gained a
          good knowledge of the Church Fathers and classical writers. In
          1198 or 1199 he entered the monastery of the Cistercians at
          Heisterbach and spent his life there in quiet seclusion. He
          became master of the novices, and also prior according to
          Henriquez (Monologium Cisterciense, ad diem 25 Sept.). His
          literary activity is closely connected with his monastic duties.
          Only sixteen of his many writings are extant and most of these
          are still in manuscript. One of the best known is the Dialogus
          miraculorum or De miraculis et visionibus sui temporis (ed. J.
          Strange, 2 vols., Cologne, 1831; index, Coblenz,1857; see
          bibliography below for title of German select transl.). As
          master of the novices Cæsarius had to acquaint the future monks
          with the regulations, opinions, and decisions of the order, and
          he believed the best way to accomplish this was by means of
          examples. At the request of his abbot he committed his
          instructions to writing and the copiousness and variety of his
          material, drawn from the recent past as well as more remote
          antiquity, is surprising. His written sources belong mostly to
          the Cistercian order, but he also drew from oral communications.
          Each narrative is intended to have a religious or moral
          practical application, but Cæsarius knew how to include
          everything under these heads, and thus it happens that his
          stories contain many points of interest for contemporaneous
          history and the history of civilization. In a series of pictures
          he brings before us the life on the Lower Rhine, especially at
          Cologne, and we often meet with popular beliefs and
          superstitions in which survivals of old Germanic mythology may
          still be discovered. The Dialogus is especially important for
          information concerning ecclesiastical customs and conditions,
          especially in the monastic life. The regulations of the
          monasteries, especially among the Cistercians, the
          chorus-singing and work, the eating and sleeping, the fasting
          and bloodletting of the monks--all comes before us in living
          examples. Cæsarius is much in earnest about the evils of
          confession; he suppresses the worst, but what he tells is bad
          enough and his judgment upon it is severe (cf. iii. 41 and 45).
          For the rest the dialogue from beginning to end is a witness to
          the mania for miracles and the belief of the time in the
          marvelous. One finds everywhere an interference of partly
          divine, partly demonic powers with earthly happenings, and when
          it takes place the most incredible becomes credible. Here is the
          weak point of the book which must not be overlooked, despite the
          poetic charm of many narratives and the morally pure personality
          of Cæsarius. He contributed his share to cause the belief in
          witchcraft and sorcery, in incubi and succubi, and all sorts of
          devilish intervention, to be regarded as a constituent part of
          Christian belief. The praise bestowed on the Dialogus induced
          Cæsarius to prepare a second work of the kind, not however in
          the form of dialogue, the Libri VIII miraculorum, of which only
          three books are preserved (ed. Aloys Meister, Rome, 1901,
          supplementary vol. to the römische Quartalschrift). Cæsarius's
          historical works include a Catalogus episcoporum Coloniensium
          (in J. F. Böhmer, Fontes rerum Germanicarum, ii., Stuttgart,
          1845, 272-282, and, ed. H. Cardauns, in MGH, Script., xxiv.,
          1879, 345-347; Germ, transl. by M. Bethany, Elberfeld, 1898) and
          a Vita sancti Engelberti, an archbishop of Cologne who was
          murdered by a relative in 1225 (in Böhmer, ut sup., 294-329).
          This work insures to Cæsarius a place among the most prominent
          biographers of the Middle Ages. The first book describes the
          personality of Engelbert; the second describes in dramatic
          manner the dangers with which the arrogance of insubordinate
          vassals threatened the archbishop, and ends with a thrilling
          account of the final catastrophe. The third book treats of the
          miracles of Engelbert, who was revered as martyr. Lastly,
          Cæsarius deserves no minor place among the preachers of his
          time. His homilies (edited by the Dominican J. A. Koppenstein, 4
          parts, Cologne, 1615-28) are indeed monastic, not popular,
          sermons, like those of Bernard of Clairvaux. But both have in
          common the rich application of Holy Writ, the connection of
          moral and allegorical exposition, and the endeavor to edify
          their hearers. In spite of their simplicity they reveal an
          indeed unsought for, but not unconscious art in their plan.
          Peculiar to Cæsarius and corresponding to his method, already
          noted, is the very copious intertwining of historical examples
          from modern times. He was a true child of his time, and belongs
          to its best. In him still lives the spirit of the old
          Cistercians, as Bernard impressed it on the order. He unites an
          earnest orthodoxy with fervent piety and a highly moral
          sentiment. Though implicitly devoted to the Church, nevertheless
          he has a keen eye for its obvious defects, and his judgment was
          incorruptible. Though a zealous monk, he did not lose all
          interest in the events of the world, and the political disorders
          of the time, with all the misery which they brought, concern
          him.

   Cæsaropapism
          CÆSAROPAPISM: A name applied to the conception of the relations
          between Church and State which contemplates the secular ruler's
          exercising spiritual power also. It is thus the converse of the
          theocratic system which the popes have attempted to carry into
          effect (i.e., in regard to the world at large, not to their
          limited states), which also underlies Calvin's teaching as to
          the relations of Church and State. Its principles are met with
          as early as 355, when Constantine addressed the Synod at Milan
          in the words: "Whatever I will, let that be acknowledged as a
          'canon' " (Athanasius, Hist. Arian., xxxiii.; NPNF, 2d ser., iv.
          281). It developed more rapidly in the Eastern Church because of
          the absence of the counterpoise which the papacy formed in the
          West. Justinian may be regarded as a typical representative of
          it; but the Church managed during the iconoclastic controversy
          to free itself in a large measure from imperial dictation. Since
          that time the term has not borne any strict application, though
          it is sometimes applied in a modified sense to the position of
          the Czars since Peter the Great in the Russian Church, and has
          sometimes, though with still less justice, been used of the
          German evangelical princes who have exercised authority in
          spiritual things, though even the territorial system recognizes
          a sphere for religion independent of the State. [7] See
          [626]Erastus, Thomas.

   Caiaphas
          CAIAPHAS, c?i´?-f?s (more exactly Joseph, who also was called
          Caiaphas; cf. Josephus, Ant., XVIII. ii. 2): The Jewish high
          priest who held office during the ministry and death of Jesus.
          He was the last of the four high priests whom the Roman
          procurator Valerius Gratus appointed successively to this
          dignity. As Valerius was procurator from 15 to 26 A.D., his
          appointment of Caiaphas must have occurred at the latest in 26
          A.D.; most likely it happened c. 18 A.D., as Valerius Gratus
          probably appointed Ishmael, the first of the four high priests,
          immediately after his own inauguration, and as the next two
          remained in office only about one year, Caiaphas held his office
          until c. 36 A.D., when he was removed by Vitellius, the legate
          of Syria. His administration, therefore, lasted about eighteen
          years--a long term when compared with that of most other high
          priests of the Roman period. For this he was probably indebted
          less to his ability than to his submissiveness to the
          anti-Jewish policy of the Roman government. Probably he belonged
          to the party of the Sadducees and shared their fondness for
          foreign ideas, as did his father-in law Annas (Acts iv. 1, 6; v.
          17) and the latter's son Annas the Younger (Josephus, Ant., XX,
          ix. 1). See [627]Annas.

   Caillin, Saint, of Fenagh
          CAILLIN, SAINT, OF FENAGH: Irish saint of the "second order" who
          flourished about 560. His alleged history is a typical one among
          the stories of the Irish "saints," and is also noteworthy for
          the light it throws on the conditions of the time and the
          progress of Christianity in pagan Ireland. Caillin's kinsmen of
          Dunmore (County Galway) had determined to slay a part of their
          number, the land having become overpopulated; but, on the advice
          of the saint, who had received Christian education in Rome, they
          desisted, and Caillin undertook to find more land. In the course
          of the search he came to Fenagh (County Leitrim, 3 m. s.w. of.
          Ballinamore), where he converted the kings son, Hugh, and a band
          of warriors sent to drive him away. The prince then gave the
          saint his fortress and the latter built a church there. When the
          druids came, at the king's behest, to expel Caillin, he
          restrained his Christian followers from attacking them, and
          turned them into stones. Hugh succeeded to the throne on his
          father's death; he was known as "the Dark" from his personal
          appearance, but Caillin made him of fair complexion.
          Notwithstanding his love of peace, Caillin is said to have given
          the tribe a cathach or standard, a mighty talisman in battle.

   Cain, Kenites

  CAIN, KENITES:

    The Kenites.

          The Hebrew word K?ayin occurs in the Old Testament as the name
          of a stock of nomads, associated with Midian, Amalek, and
          Israel, mentioned in Judges iv. 11 and Num. xxiv. 22, probably
          also to be read in I Sam. xv. 6b. More often the form K?eni,
          "Kenite," is met (Gen. xv. 19; Num. xxiv. 21; Judges iv. 11, 17,
          etc.). In the time of Moses this stock seems to have been
          dependent on the Midianites, since Hobab, Moses's father-in-law,
          appears (Judges i. 16) as the head of a Kenite family, and in
          Num. x. 29 is designated as a Midianite, as is Jethro in Ex.
          iii. 1 and Reuel in Ex. ii. 16. Midianites is most likely the
          larger term and includes the Kenites as one of the branches. The
          Kenites attached themselves to the Israelites during the
          wandering; at the time of Barak and Deborah the Kenite Heber was
          near the plain of Jezreel, detached from the rest of his tribe
          (Judges iv. 11). In Saul's time the Kenites were associated with
          the Amalekites. It is noteworthy that in I Chron. ii. 55 the
          Kenites are brought into connection with the Rechabites, who
          retained primitive customs, suggesting their adherence to a
          nomadic form of life and to the primitive Yahweh-religion of the
          desert (Jer. xxxv.).

    Their Relation to Cain.

          This stock of Cain was apparently intended to be brought into
          connection with the patriarchs of the race (Gen. iv. 1-16); the
          conclusion of Wellhausen, Budde, and Stade, however, is that
          originally the story of Cain had nothing to do with the Kenites
          for the following reasons: Gen. iv. 17 sqq. deals with the world
          at large (verses 17, 20-22); Gen. iv. 1-16 with the land of
          Israel and neighboring deserts. The Adhamah, "ground," of Gen.
          iv. 14 can be only the land inhabited by Israel from which Cain
          was banished. Gen. iv. 20 makes Jabal the ancestor of nomads,
          while Cain's nomadic condition resulted from his sin (iv.
          14-16). Abel, too, was a shepherd of small cattle who dwelt in
          Yahweh's land. The story of Cain in this passage can not be
          understood to deal with the earliest ages of mankind because of
          the advanced civilization it implies. Its region is the southern
          part of Palestine; it explained the separation of a people whose
          God was the same as Israel's by the commission of murder which
          is named fratricide because of the close connection of Kenites
          and Hebrews. The mark for Cain, worn on the forehead, must have
          denoted adherence to the worship of Yahweh (cf. Ex. xiii. 9, 16;
          Isa. xliv. 6; I Kings xx. 38, 41), and implied the same limits
          in exacting blood-revenge as were obligatory on the Israelites.

    Cain in Gen. iv.

          The word K?ayin also occurs as the name of an ancestor of a part
          of mankind. The name stands in J at the head of the so-called
          Cainite table, Gen. iv. 17. In its present form this includes
          seven generations, and in the seventh four branches
          appear--Jabal and Jubal, sons of Lamech by Adah, and Tubal-cain
          and Naamah, son and daughter of Lamech by Zillah. Cain built the
          first city and named it after his son Enoch; Jabal was the
          ancestor of nomads, Jubal of musicians, and Tubal-Cain of
          artisans. The table evidently is an account of supposed origins
          of civilization, so is to be related to Gen. ix. 20-27. Then
          Noah's earlier connection with the Cainite table through Lamech
          is probable, though in Gen. v. 28 (P) he is a Sethite. That the
          narratives are doublets appears on comparison (cf. Cain and
          Kenan, Methusael and Methuselah, Ired and Jared, as well as the
          fact that Adam and Enos both mean "man"). The Sethite and the
          Cainite tables are both traced to a single original, and the
          Cainite line of J is believed to have been originally a Sethite
          line, while Gen. iv. 25-26 originally preceded iv. 17.

          The present form of the text is probably attributable to the
          editor of the work of J who inserted the flood story. He
          borrowed the material from an old Sethite table, and setting
          Cain at the head formed a Cainite table and inserted the
          Cain-story (Gen. iv. 1-16) and the sword-song of Lamech. He thus
          brought into juxtaposition the killing by Lamech and that by
          Cain, completed the identification of Cain [father of the
          Kenites and Cain brother of Abel] through Cain, founder of the
          city. Thus he secured a contrast between the godless Cainites
          and the pious Sethites on which was founded the ecclesiastical
          tradition that alienation from God was in the Cainite blood,
          while in the Sethite piety was instinctive.

          Of the other names in the table little need be said. In II Sam.
          xxi. 16 K?ayin means "a spear," in Arabic and Syriac "a smith,"
          and possibly (Gen. iv. 1) is to be connected with the word to
          "make." Enoch (Hanokh) is the name of a Reubenite (Gen. xlvi. 9)
          and a Midianite (Gen. xxv. 4) stock (cf. the Annakus who was
          king of Phrygia, mentioned by Stephen of Byzantium). With Jubal
          should be connected the Hebrew for "ram's horn" (Joshua vi. 5).
          Tubal is the Tibareni of Asia Minor (Gen. x. 2), while the
          addition of Cain, "smith," goes well with their reputation for
          metalwork. A goddess Adah was worshiped by Babylonians, and one
          named Naamah by the Phenicians.

   Cainites
          CAINITES: According to Irenæus (Hær., i. 31), a sect of the
          [628]Ophites who worshiped Cain as an instrument of the Gnostic
          Sophia, treated with hostility by the demiurge. They saw in
          Judas the one who best of all knew the truth, celebrated his
          treason as a mystery, and had a "Gospel of Judas." The notices
          of Pseudo-Tertullian (Hær., vii.), Philastrius (Hær., ii.), and
          Epiphanius (Hær., xxxviii.) accord with these statements. Cain
          was generated of higher power than Abel, and Judas was the
          benefactor of the human race, either because by his treason he
          frustrated Christ's intention to destroy truth (Philastrius), or
          because he compelled the archons to kill Christ, and so assisted
          in obtaining the salvation of the cross (Epiphanius). When
          Tertullian (Præscriptio hæreticorum, xxxiii.; cf. De baptismo,
          i.) mentions "Gaiana heresis" he probably refers to the
          Cainites. Cf. also Clement, Strom., vi. 108; Theodoret, Hær., i.
          15; Hippolytus, Phil., viii. 20. For Cainites, descendants of

   Caird, John
          CAIRD, JOHN: Church of Scotland: b. at Greenock (23 m. w.n.w. of
          Glasgow), Renfrewshire, Dec. 15, 1820; d. there July 30, 1898.
          He was educated at the University of Glasgow (1837-1838,
          1840-45; M.A., 1845), interrupting his studies in 1838-39 while
          engaged in his father's engineering works. After the completion
          of his education he was minister successively at Newton-on-Ayr
          (1845-1847), Lady Yester's, Edinburgh (1847-49), Errol,
          Perthshire (1849-57), and the Park Church, Glasgow (1857-62). In
          1862 he was appointed professor of theology in the University of
          Glasgow, where he became principal and vice-chancellor in 1873,
          retaining both positions until his death, although he announced
          his intention of resigning early in 1898. He was Croall Lecturer
          at Edinburgh in 1878-79 and Gifford Lecturer at Glasgow in
          1890-91 and 1896, though a stroke of paralysis forced him to
          discontinue this second course. He wrote: Sermons (Edinburgh,
          1858); Introduction to the Philosophy of Religion (Croall
          lectures for 1878-79; Glasgow, 1880); Spinoza (Edinburgh, 1886);
          and the posthumous University Addresses (Glasgow, 1898):
          University Sermons (1898); and The Fundamental Ideas of
          Christianity (Gifford lectures; 2 vols., 1899; ed., with a
          memoir of the author, by E. Caird).

   Cairns, John
          CAIRNS, JOHN: United Presbyterian Church, Scotland b. at Ayton
          Hill (7 m. n.w. of Berwick-on-Tweed) Aug. 23, 1818; d. in
          Edinburgh Mar. 12, 1892. After being the wonder of his first
          school, he became the wonder of the University of Edinburgh,
          where he studied arts (1834-40), and of Secession Hall, where he
          studied theology (1840-43). In 1843-44 he studied and traveled
          on the Continent and received impressions and made
          acquaintances, especially in Germany, which affected his life.
          From 1845 till 1876 he was minister of the Golden Square United
          Presbyterian Church, Berwick-on-Tweed. In frame he was massive,
          and he had apparently great powers of endurance, but he toiled
          too much, responded to too many calls in every direction; and on
          all sorts of errands, and so in 1855 broke down and after that
          was frequently laid aside. He early became one of the leaders of
          his denomination, and developed into one of the foremost
          Scotchmen. He was from 1867 to 1876 professor of apologetics in
          the theological hall of his denomination in Edinburgh; in 1872
          moderator of its general assembly. In 1876 he gave up his
          pastoral charge, and moving to Edinburgh received the joint
          professorship (with the principal) of systematic theology and
          apologetics--the terms of which had been lengthened from seven
          weeks to five months. In 1879 he succeeded to the principalship.
          In 1880 he visited America and was a prominent character in the
          second council of the Alliance of the Reformed Churches held in
          Philadelphia. He died of heart disease after a brief illness. He
          never married.

          His best work was done upon the platform and in the pulpit. The
          great respect felt for him there and as a man of affairs and
          counsel withheld criticism of him as an educator, for as such he
          was less successful. He had considerable learning and remarkable
          gifts, especially in the way of language, and he acquired
          foreign languages readily, even such tongues as Assyrian and
          Arabic when in middle life. He was sprung from the common
          people, understood how to address them, and was reverenced by
          them. His nature was genial, free from affectation and hauteur,
          and he was untiring in the service of others. He made a deep
          impression on his own generation by his broad-mindedness, moral
          courage, and fervent eloquence.

          The topics upon which he spoke with convincing power, springing
          from deep conviction, were the freedom of the Church from the
          State; home and foreign missions; temperance, and (after, 1874)
          in advocacy of total abstinence; modification of the Confession
          of Faith, by a declaratory statement (adopted 1879); union of
          the United Presbyterian, the Free Church, and the Church of
          Scotland (realized as far as the first two are concerned in
          1900); and the disestablishment of the Church of Scotland.

          His literary work was small in amount. He published aside from
          pamphlets a memoir of Rev. John Brown, of the United
          Presbyterian Church, father of the author of Rab and his Friends
          (Edinburgh, 1860); Unbelief in the Eighteenth Century,
          Cunningham lectures for 1881; and after his death came a volume
          of his sermons, Christ the Morning Star, and Other Sermons
          (London, 1892).

   Caius
          CAIUS, kê´Us: The name of several characters in Roman history,
          of whom only two need be included here.

          1. Roman author early in the third century, mentioned by
          Hippolytus, Dionysius of Alexandria, and Eusebius. What
          Theodoret and Jerome tell of him rests on Eusebius; Photius's
          account is worthless, as the tradition from which he derived it
          confused Hippolytus and Caius. It is doubtful whether he was a
          Roman presbyter, to say nothing of the title of "bishop of the
          nations" given him by Photius from tradition. In the library at
          Jerusalem Eusebius found a work of his, the "Dialogue with
          Proclus" (the head of the Roman Montanists); but this is the
          only one known. From the quotations of Eusebius it appears that
          Caius rebuked the audacity of the Montanists in manufacturing
          new Scriptures, that he rejected millenarianism and with it the
          Apocalypse, and that he recognized only thirteen epistles of
          Paul. Ebed Jesu (in Assemani, Bibl. Orient., III. i., p. 15)
          says that Hippolytus wrote some Capita adversus Caium; and this
          statement is now confirmed by the discovery of John Gwynn, who
          found in the British Museum and published five fragments of
          these very Capita (Hermathena, vi., Dublin, 1888). From the
          statements of Caius here attacked it is clear that he spoke
          strongly against the contents of the Apocalypse (presumably in
          the "Dialogue"), and considered it as unworthy of credence and
          conflicting with the Holy Scriptures. Thus from one of
          Eusebius's references (Hist. eccl., III. xxviii. 1-2) the
          conclusion is almost certainly justified that Caius held the
          Apocalypse to be the work of Cerinthus. Since this view is also
          that of the Alogians of Asia Minor, and since the method of his
          polemic against the book strikingly suggests theirs, a
          connection between them is a plausible hypothesis.

          2. Pope 283-296. These dates, Dec. 17 for his election and Apr.
          22 for his death, are given in the Catalogus Liberianus;
          Eusebius (Hist. eccl., VII. xxxii. 1) ascribes to him a
          pontificate of about fifteen years. In any case, his role falls
          in the peaceful period before the outbreak of the persecution of
          Diocletian, and for this reason, if for no other, the tradition
          that he died a martyr is incredible. According to the Depositio
          episcoporum he was buried in the cemetery of St. Calixtus.

   Cajetan, Thomas
          CAJETAN, c?´jê-t?n or caj´e-tan, THOMAS: Italian cardinal; b. at
          Gaeta Feb. 20, 1469; d. at Rome Aug. 9, 1534. His real name was
          Jacopo Vio, he took the monastic name Thomas, and his surname is
          from his birthplace. At the age of fifteen he entered the
          Dominican order, and, devoting himself to studies in the Thomist
          philosophy, became, before he was thirty, one of its noted
          teachers; he was made general procurator in 1507 and general a
          year later. Faithful, to the traditions of the Dominicans, he
          appears in 1511 as a supporter of the pope against the claims of
          the Council of Pisa, composing in defense of his position the
          Tractatus de Comparatione auctoritatis Papeæ et conciliorum ad
          invicem. At the Fifth Lateran Council (1512-17) which Julius II.
          set up in opposition to that of Pisa, Cajetan played the leading
          rôle; and it was he who during the second session of the council
          brought about the decree recognizing the infallibility of the
          pope and the superiority of his authority to that of the
          council. For his services Leo X. made him in 1517 cardinal
          presbyter of Saint Sisto, Rome, and bestowed on him in the
          following year the bishopric of Palermo. This he resigned in
          1519 to take the bishopric of Gaeta granted him by the emperor
          Charles V., for whose election Cajetan had labored zealously. In
          1518 he was sent as legate to the Diet of Augsburg and to him,
          at the wish of the Saxon elector, was entrusted the task of
          examining and testing the teachings of Luther. Treatises of his
          own, written, without knowledge of Luther's theses, in 1517 show
          that Luther was justified in his assertion that on the doctrine
          of dispensation the Church had as yet arrived at no firmly
          established position; the doctrine of confession Cajetan seemed
          also to regard as a subject open to controversy. Yet more than
          investigator and thinker he was politician and prelate, and his
          appearance at Augsburg in all the splendor of ecclesiastical
          pomp only served to reveal him to Luther as the type of Roman
          curialist, hateful to Germans and German Christianity. Cajetan
          was active in furthering the election of Adrian VI., retained
          influence under Clement VII., suffered a short term of
          imprisonment after the storming of Rome by the Constable of
          Bourbon and by Frundsberg (1527), retired to his bishopric for a
          few years, and, returning to Rome in 1530, assumed his old
          position of influence about the person of Clement, in whose
          behalf he wrote the decision rejecting the appeal for divorce
          from Catharine of Aragon made by Henry VIII. of England (March
          23,1534; printed in Records of the Reformation, ed. N. Power,
          Oxford, 2 vols., 1870, ii. 532-533). Of the Reformation he
          remained a steadfast opponent, composing several works directed
          against Luther, and taking an important share in shaping the
          policy of the papal delegates in Germany. [8] Learned though he
          was in the scholastics, he recognized that to fight the
          Reformers with some chance of success a deeper knowledge of the
          Scriptures than he possessed was necessary. To this study he
          devoted himself with characteristic zeal, wrote commentaries on
          the greater part of the Old and the New Testament, and, in the
          exposition of his text, which he treated critically, allowed
          himself considerable latitude in departing from the literal and
          traditional interpretation. In the very field of Thomist
          philosophy he showed striking independence of judgment,
          expressing liberal views on marriage and divorce, denying the
          existence of a material hell and advocating the celebration of
          public prayers in the vernacular. The Sorbonne found some of
          these views heterodox, and in the 1570 edition of his celebrated
          commentary on the Summa of Thomas Aquinas (counted among the
          best; new ed., Lierre, 1892 sqq.) the objectionable passages
          were expunged. A complete edition of his works with life
          appeared in five volumes at Lyons, 1639.

   Calamy
          CALAMY: The name of an English family which produced several
          distinguished clergymen in the seventeenth century.

          1. Edmund Calamy the Elder: Presbyterian; b. in London Feb.,
          1600; d. there Oct. 29, 1666. He was educated at Pembroke Hall,
          Cambridge; became (1626) vicar of St. Mary's in Swaffham Prior,
          Cambridgeshire; thence in the same year removed to St. Edmund's
          Bury in Suffolk as lecturer, where he remained ten years, until
          compelled to retire on account of his opposition to the Book of
          Sports, thereby identifying himself with the Puritan party. He
          accepted from the Earl of Warwick the rectory of Rochford in
          Essex, where he remained until in 1639 he was chosen pastor of
          St. Mary Aldermanbury Church in London, where he labored until
          1662. He composed in 1641 with others "An Answer to a Book
          entitled, An Humble Remonstrance in which, the original of
          Liturgy and Episcopacy is discussed: and Queries proposed
          concerning both. The Parity of Bishops & Presbyters in Scripture
          demonstrated. The occasion of their Imparity in Antiquity
          discovered. The Disparity of the Ancient & our modern Bishops
          manifested. The Antiquity of Ruling Elders in the Church
          vindicated. The Prelatical church bounded. Written by
          Smectymnuus [i.e., S(tephen) M(arshall), E(dmund) C(alamy),
          T(homas) Y(oung), M(atthew) N(ewcommen), and W(illiam)
          S(purstow)]. This reply to Joseph Hall's Humble Remonstrance
          became the platform of the Presbyterians, as that became the
          platform of the Episcopal party, each side claiming jure divino.
          Several other tracts were issued in the controversy pro and con.
          Calamy was chosen a member of the Westminster Assembly of
          Divines (1643), and took an active part in its proceedings,
          being moderate in doctrinal position, and inclined to a union
          with both Independents and Episcopalians in some comprehensive
          polity. He also became one of the most energetic members of the
          Provincial Assembly of London; took part in the composition of
          the Vindication of the Presbyterian Government and Ministry,
          1649; was the author of the Jus Divinum Ministerii Evangelici,
          1654, both adopted by that body. He had opposed the execution of
          Charles I. and was active in restoring Charles II. to the
          kingdom in 1659; was one of the divines sent to Holland to treat
          with him. At the Restoration in 1660 he was made one of the
          king's chaplains, and offered the bishopric of Coventry and
          Lichfield, which, however, he declined. With Batter, Reynolds,
          and others, be gave his energies for a comprehension of
          Presbyterians and Episcopalians through a revision of the
          Liturgy, and a reduction of Episcopacy on Archbishop Ussher's
          model. He took part in drawing up the Exceptions against the
          Liturgy, and reply to the Reasons of the Episcopal clergy. He
          was a great preacher, frequently delivering sermons before
          Parliament and the lord mayors on public occasions; and his
          lectures were frequented by the best people of London. A number
          of these have been published. His most popular work is The Godly
          Man's Ark (London, 1657; 18th ed., 1709; reprinted, 1865). He
          was the compiler of The Souldier's Pocket Bible, issued for the
          use of the Commonwealth army in 1643; reprinted in facsimile
          1891. He was a practical man of affairs, rather than a scholar
          and writer. He was ejected for non-conformity in 1662, and
          imprisoned in Newgate for a short time for having, preached
          after his ejection. But the king interposed, on account of great
          public indignation, and he was released.

          2. Edmund Calamy the Younger: Non-conforming minister, eldest
          son of Edmund Calamy the elder; b. at Bury St. Edmunds about
          1635; d. at Totteridge, near Barnet; May, 1685. He studied at
          Sidney Sussex College and Pembroke Hall, Cambridge (B.A.; 1654;
          M.A., 1658); was made rector of Moreton, Essex, 1658; ejected on
          the passage of the Uniformity Act (1662), and thenceforth lived
          a retired life in London, preaching occasionally in private or
          to friends.

          3. Benjamin Calamy: Church of England, second son of Edmund
          Calamy the elder; b. in London on or before June 8, 1642; d.
          there Jan., 1686 (buried Jan. 7). He studied at Catherine Hall,
          Cambridge (B.A., 1664; M.A., 1668; D.D., 1680); became curate of
          St. Mary Aldermanbury, London, 1677, from which his father was
          ejected fifteen years earlier; king's chaplain 1680; vicar of
          St. Lawrence Jewry, with St. Mary Magdalene, Milk Street,
          annexed, 1683; prebendary of St. Paul's 1685. Unlike his father
          and elder brother, he was a High-churchman; he lived on very
          friendly terms, however, with his non-conformist brother and
          befriended the latter's son. He published many sermons which are
          commended for beauty of language and excellent sentiments. His
          Discourse about a Doubting (in the second edition, Scrupulous)
          Conscience (1683) made a great sensation, it was directed
          against dissenters and called forth a reply from Thomas de
          Laune, a Baptist schoolmaster (A Plea for the Non-Conformists,
          1684). His brother James Calamy edited a volume of his sermons,
          containing also his funeral sermon by Dean Sherlock (London,
          1690; several subsequent editions).

          4. Edmund Calamy: The historian of nonconformity, son of Edmund
          Calamy the younger; b. in London Apr. 5, 1671; d. there. June 3,
          1732. He studied at several schools kept by ejected ministers in
          England, and at the University of Utrecht, 1688-89; then spent
          nine months at Oxford; became assistant to Matthew Sylvester at
          Blackfriars, London, 1692; was ordained 1694; in 1703 settled as
          pastor of a church in Westminster, London. He was a man of
          winning manners and much tact, and succeeded in accomplishing
          his purposes without making enemies. His publications were
          numerous, for the most part sermons; those which have permanent
          value are his historical works on English non-conformity. He
          edited Baxter's Narrative (Reliquiæ Baxterianæ) and supplied an
          index and table of contents (1696); six years later he published
          an abridgment of the same work, adding a history of ministers
          ejected for non-conformity down to the close of Baxter's life in
          1691. The publication provoked much criticism, to which Calamy
          replied in a second edition (2 vols., 1713) bringing the history
          down to 1711; and in 1727 he published a continuation of the
          work in two volumes. Calamy's four volumes were condensed into
          two by Samuel Palmer, with the title The Non-Conformist's
          Memorial (1775), and a three-volume edition was issued in 1803.
          He left an autobiography, An Historical Account of my Own Life,
          with some reflections on the times I have lived in, edited by
          John Towill Rutt (2 vols., London, 1829). Calamy was well
          qualified by his moderation and catholicity to be the
          fair-minded historian of non-conformity.

   Calatrava, Order of
          CALATRAVA, ORDER OF: A knightly order, founded about the middle
          of the twelfth century, to defend the frontiers of Christian
          Spain against the Moors. The fortress of Calatrava (on the
          Guadiana, 65 m. s.e. of Toledo), on the borders of Andalusia,
          commanded the passes into Castile and was hotly contested. After
          being bravely held for several years by a company of monks and
          knights under the lead of a Cistercian monk and former soldier,
          Velasquez, and the abbot Raymond of Fitero, it was presented to
          the band by Sancho III., king of Castile, in 1158. The general
          chapter of the Cistercians gave the order a rule under the
          oversight of the monastery of Morimund, and prescribed as dress
          a white scapulary (or white cloak) with a garland of red lilies.
          The rule was confirmed by Pope Alexander III. in 1164. The
          knights of the order captured Cordova in 1177 and performed
          other noteworthy deeds of arms. After 1195 a long period of
          decline began. Calatrava was lost and the seat of the order was
          transferred to Salvatierra (Mons Salutis) in the Sierra Morena.
          In 1212 Calatrava was again occupied, but was abandoned for New
          Calatrava, eight miles farther south, in 1218, the [636]Order of
          Alcantara undertaking the defense of Calatrava. Toward the end
          of the Middle Ages the grand master possessed such wealth and
          power that he became an object of suspicion to the crown. At the
          instigation of Ferdinand and Isabella, Pope Innocent VIII, in
          1486 deprived the order of the right of choosing its master, and
          after 1523 the office was united with the crown. Since 1808 the
          order has been merely one of merit. Nuns of Calatrava were
          instituted by the grand master Gonzalez Yanes in 1219 at the
          time of the removal to New Calatrava. They had their convent at
          Barrios near Amaya, later at Burgos, but never attained to
          importance.

          and at St. John's College, Cambridge (B.A., 1879), and was
          ordered deacon in 1880, and ordained priest two years later. He
          was curate of Christ Church, Stafford, in 1880, fellow of St.
          John's College, Cambridge, in 1880-86, and fellow and dean of
          the same college in 1889-95, in addition to being curate of St.
          Paul's, Cambridge, in 1881-82, vicar of Horningsey,
          Cambridgeshire, in 1882-84, and principal of Codrington College,
          Barbados, and examining chaplain to the bishop of Barbados in
          1884-86. He was organizing secretary of the Society for the
          Propagation of the Gospel at Cambridge in 1889-1905, and was
          rector of North cum South Lophan, Norfolk, in 1895-98. Since the
          latter year he has been rector of Frating cum Thorington, Essex,
          and has also been examining chaplain to the bishop of St. Albans
          since 1903. He was examiner in Moral Science Tripos in Cambridge
          in 1884, 1888-89, and 1893-94, and was select preacher in the
          same university in 1884, 1890-91, and 1894, while in 1891-1892
          he was junior proctor. In addition to his duties as rector, he
          has been professor of moral and mental philosophy in King's
          College, London, since 1891, and examiner in theology in the
          University of London since 1902, as well as Cambridge Extension
          Lecturer in 1880-82 and 1886-87. He has likewise been senior
          secretary of St. John's Cambridge Mission in South London in
          1883-86 and 1889-95, vice-president of the Cambridge Ethical
          Society in 1890-1905, governor of Colchester Grammar School in
          1900-05, a member of the committee of the Christian Evidence
          Society since 1903, and a member of the Senate of the University
          of London since 1904. In 1906 he was elected a fellow of King's
          College, London. He has written: English Colonisation and Empire
          (London, 1891); The Church in the West Indies (1898); and The
          Philosophy of Religion in England and America (1901).

   Calderwood, David
          CALDERWOOD, DAVID: The historian of the Church of Scotland; b.
          probably at Dalkeith (7 m. s.e. of Edinburgh) 1575; d. at
          Jedburgh (40 m. s.e. of Edinburgh) Oct. 29, 1650. He studied at
          Edinburgh, and in 1604 was ordained minister of Crailing, near
          Jedburgh. He was a determined opponent of the scheme of King
          James to introduce prelacy into the Church of Scotland; in 1617
          he presented a remonstrance to the king, and argued so boldly
          and successfully in support of his position that he was
          imprisoned and ultimately ordered to leave the country. He went
          to Holland (1619), where he lived in quiet and obscurity; at one
          time it was rumored that he was dead and a false Recantation
          Directed to Such in Scotland as Refuse Conformity to the
          Ordinances of the Church, was published and ascribed to him
          (London, 1622). After the death of James (1625) he returned to
          Scotland, but did not obtain a charge until 1640, when he was
          appointed minister at Pencaitland, East Lothian. Gradually he
          came again into prominence and, with David Dickson and Alexander
          Henderson, was employed in drawing up the "Directory for Public
          Worship." In 1648 the General Assembly voted him an annual
          pension of £800 Scots (£66 13s. 4d. sterling) to enable him to
          complete his great work, the history of the Kirk of Scotland. He
          died, however, leaving it still in manuscript, and in three
          forms; the first and longest is now partially preserved in the
          British Museum; the second, "a digest of the first," was
          published with a Life by Thomas Thomson by the Wodrow Society in
          eight volumes, Edinburgh, 1842-49; the third, another
          abridgment, was published in 1678 with the title The True
          History of the Church of Scotland from the Beginning of the
          Reformation unto the End of the Reign of King James VI. These
          histories have slight literary merit, but are invaluable as
          sources, their material having been collected with diligence and
          fidelity. The most notable of Calderwood's other publications
          was his Altar of Damascus, or the pattern of the English
          hierarchy and church obtruded upon the Church of Scotland
          (Leyden, 1621; Lat. transl., Altare Damascenum, with
          considerable additions, 1623; 2d ed., 1708), which became later
          the great storehouse of arguments in favor of Presbyterianism.

   Calderwood, Henry
          CALDERWOOD, HENRY: United Presbyterian Church of Scotland; b. at
          Peebles (21 m. s. of Edinburgh) May 10, 1830; d. at Edinburgh
          Nov. 19, 1897. He studied at the University of Edinburgh and the
          theological hall there of the United Presbyterian Church; was
          ordained minister of Greyfriars Church, Glasgow, 1856; was
          appointed professor of moral philosophy, Edinburgh, 1868. As a
          philosopher "he tried to discover and explain the bearings of
          physiological science on man's mental and moral nature. . . . He
          believed it to be demonstrated by physiology that the direct
          dependence of mind on brain was confined to the sensory-motor
          functions, the dependence of the higher forms of mental activity
          being, on the other hand, only indirect. He endeavored to
          establish the thesis that man's intellectual and spiritual life,
          as we know it, is not the product of natural evolution, but
          necessitates the assumption of a new creative cause." His
          interests were not confined to his professional work; he was
          chairman of the Edinburgh school board, chairman of the North
          and East of Scotland Liberal Unionist Association, was a member
          of the mission board of his Church, and advocated temperance
          reform, Presbyterian union, and other philanthropic and
          religious movements. He edited The United Presbyterian Magazine,
          and published The Philosophy of the Infinite (London, 1854), a
          criticism of Sir William Hamilton prepared during his student
          days; Handbook of Moral Philosophy (1872); On Teaching, its
          Means and Ends (1874); The Relations of Mind and Brain (1879);
          The Parables of our Lord (1880); The Relations of Science and
          Religion, Morse lectures before Union Theological Seminary, New
          York, 1880 (1881); Evolution and Man's Place in Nature (1893;
          enlarged ed., 1896); several of these works have appeared in
          many editions.

   Caleb, Calebites
          CALEB, CALEBITES: One of twelve scouts whom Moses sent from the
          Wilderness of Sin to spy out the promised land (Num. xii.
          16-xiii. 17a, 21, 25), and his descendants. According to Num.
          xiii. 6 he represented the tribe of Judah. Joshua xiv. 6, 14
          designates him as "the Kenizzite," with which Joshua xv. 17
          agrees in making Othniel, the brother of Caleb, the "son of
          Kenaz." The Kenizzites were a branch of the Edomitic stock,
          Kenaz being a grandson of Esau (Gen. xxxvi. 11, 15). Then Caleb,
          and Othniel were originally not Israelites, but had left their
          people and united with the Hebrews, and this agrees with the
          location of their settlements in Hebron and Debir (Josh. xiv.
          6-15, xv. 13-19; Judges i. 12-15, 20). I Chron. ii. 42-49 puts
          into the possession of Caleb Maresha, Hebron, Tappuah, Maon,
          Jokdeam, and Beth-zur (Madmannah, verse 49, is a city of the
          Negeb, Josh. xv. 31). The Calebites occupied the same region in
          the time of Saul and David, and to them belonged a part of the
          Negeb (I Sam. xxx. 14). There David lived long as a freebooter,
          his first wife was of Calebite stock, and Abigail was from
          Maon-Carmel. After Saul's death David occupied Hebron and its
          Calebite neighborhood and was there made king. His realm
          included the territory of Caleb and Judah, though the latter
          gave the name to his kingdom. In spite of the formal union of
          the two peoples, the Calebites maintained a practical
          independence with a residence in Judahitic territory. This
          explains Absalom's resort to Hebron in his insurrection against
          David.

          The name Caleb was then originally that of a stock, and,
          personified, became that of the eponymous ancestor (see
          [637]Eponym). With this the story of Achsah (Judges i. 12-15,
          Josh. xv. 15-19) is seen to agree when it is remembered that
          tribally "daughter" means a weaker stock which has lost its
          independence to a stronger.

          The Calebites remained in the district mentioned till exilic
          times when the Edomites drove them, weakened by Nebuchadrezzar's
          measures, northward to the neighborhood of Jerusalem--a change
          explained in customary genealogical phrasing (I Chron. ii.
          18-19), and the Calebites were reckoned to Judah (I Chron. ii.
          5, 9, 18, 50-55).

          An early age can not be ascribed to the narrative which gives
          the story of the spies, since Caleb is there reckoned as a
          Judahite without any discrimination of stocks such as other
          passages cited above make necessary. The assumption in the
          representation of P in Num. xiii.-xiv., and of the Chronicler,
          of the assimilation by the Hebrews of the Calebites is good for
          postexilic times. (See Judea.)

          (H. Guthe.)

          While advanced scholarship generally takes the position
          indicated in the text (so, for example, J. A. Selbie in DB, i.
          340), conservative criticism insists that Caleb was originally a
          personal name and declines altogether the idea of eponymity; cf.

   Calendar Brethren (Fratres Calendarii)
          CALENDAR BRETHREN (Fratres Calendarii): A fraternity which arose
          in the second half of the Middle Ages, especially in lower
          Saxony, but also in other portions of Germany and occasionally
          in the neighboring countries. It might be termed a clerical
          gild, for though men who were not members of the clergy were
          admitted, they were restricted to a minor position, and the
          statutes of many communities termed only the clergy "full
          brothers." The first fraternity of Calendar Brethren which is
          definitely known to have existed was that of Laer in Westphalia
          in 1279, but it was not until the fourteenth century that they
          became numerous. They seem to have originated in the official
          conferences held by the clergy of each archdiaconate on the
          first day of the month (Latin, Kalendæ). They centered about
          religious worship, the members being required to say mass for
          the repose of each other's souls or have it said, and to pray
          for one another. They were likewise bound, as in the gilds, to
          mutual support and social elevation. With the accession of
          wealthy laymen, the fraternities gained in importance and
          wealth, and became famous for their banquets. They made a firm
          resistance to the Reformation, since they refused to allow their
          wealth to be diverted to other purposes. Some maintained
          themselves for a considerable length of time in Evangelical
          districts, but they were finally suppressed even in Roman
          Catholic countries.

    1. The Origin of the Christian Calendar.

          The Christian calendar is an index of the year arranged
          according to months and weeks, and giving a list of feasts,
          fasts, and saints' days, to which data of a more miscellaneous
          character may be added. The dependence of the feasts on
          chronology renders it necessary to consider the systems of
          reckoning time, especially as both the chronological and
          liturgical portions of the calendar were established by the
          Church, and remained in the hands of the clergy throughout the
          Middle Ages. In its most general aspect of an annual list of
          days and feasts, the Christian calendar dates from the primitive
          Church, which found its model in classical antiquity,
          particularly among the Romans. Numerous Roman calendars of the
          imperial period have been preserved either in whole or in part,
          designed for public use within areas ranging from a town to an
          entire country. These calendars contain astronomical information
          as well as lists of religious feasts and civic celebrations,
          some of which were connected with the cult, such as many of the
          public games, while others commemorated historic events. The
          transition from pagan to Christian usage may be seen in two
          calendars from the middle of the fourth and fifth centuries (ed.
          T. Mommsen, CIL, i. 332 sqq.). One of these was drawn up at Rome
          in the reign of Constantine II. and is evidently a revision of a
          pagan calendar, omitting all feasts of a distinctively religious
          character, both heathen and Christian, but retaining the purely
          civic feasts. Christian influence is visible, however, in the
          recognition of the Christian weeks beside the Roman system,
          since the year, which here begins with Jan. 1, falls in two
          regular divisions, one of eight days each (the nundinæ)
          represented by the letters A-H, and the other of seven days,
          indicated by A-G. The second calendar was prepared in 448 during
          the reign of Valentinian III., and, though pagan in basis,
          contains for the first time a small number of Christian feasts,
          having five festivals of Christ and six saints' days. The oldest
          exclusively Christian calendar is a Gothic fragment, apparently
          prepared in Thrace in the fourth century, containing the last
          eight days of October and the entire month of November. Seven
          days have the names of saints attached to them, two from the New
          Testament, three from the general Church, and two from the
          Goths.

    2. The Calendar in the Early Church.

          Even before the inclusion of Christian feasts in the Roman
          calendar, however, the Church had lists of saints' days arranged
          according to the date of their celebration, although not yet
          incorporated in a formal calendar. Allusions to such lists of
          memorial days are found in Tertullian and Cyprian, but the
          earliest one extant was prepared at Rome in the middle of the
          fourth century. It consists of an enumeration of twelve Roman
          bishops and a list of martyrs for twenty-four days, including
          feasts in commemoration of the birth of Christ and of St. Peter
          (Feb. 22), all the remainder being festivals of martyrs,
          generally of local origin. The next oldest calendar is a list of
          the festivals of the Church of Carthage, which apparently dates
          from the end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth century,
          and contains the names of bishops and martyrs, the most of whom
          were natives of Carthage. From such beginnings a wealth of
          calendars soon developed throughout the Latin world, and the
          lists of the days of the month received an increasing proportion
          of martyrological, hagiological, and heortological material. The
          active intercourse of the churches, especially of Rome with
          Africa, Gaul, Spain, and England, resulted in the addition of
          such numbers of foreign saints that those who received honor
          throughout the Church exceeded the saints of local fame, and
          finally there was no day of the year which did not have one or
          more saints. Since martyrs were commemorated in the early Church
          especially in the place where they had suffered, each community
          originally had its own list of feasts and its own calendar. This
          usage was of long duration, despite the frequent interchange of
          names and despite the increasing prestige of the Roman calendar
          and list of feasts. The diversity of calendars was augmented,
          moreover, by the reverence paid to the local saints of
          individual countries and dioceses, while a still more important
          factor was the discrepancy in the dating of the beginning of the
          year.

    3. Complications in Dating.

          The first of the year was reckoned from no less than six days:
          (1) the Feast of the Circumcision (Jan. 1; used in conformity to
          the Julian calendar); (2) Mar. 1 (Merovingian France, the
          Lombards, Venice, and, for a time, Russia); (3) the Feast of the
          Annunciation (Mar. 25; first in Florence and Pisa, whence it
          extended to France, Germany, England, and Ireland, being
          retained in the latter two countries until the eighteenth
          century); (4) Easter (especially in France); (5) Sept. 1
          (Byzantine Empire, and, until modern times, Russia); (6)
          Christmas (Carolingian France, the Anglo-Saxons, Scandinavia,
          Prussia, Hungary, and portions of Holland, Switzerland, etc.).
          The problem was further complicated by the various methods of
          indicating the day of the month, of which at least five systems
          were used contemporaneously: (1) the ancient Roman method of
          calends, ides, and nones; (2) the Greco-Christian consecutive
          numbering of the days of the month, now generally used; (3) the
          consuetudo Bononiensis, which divided the month into two halves,
          in one of which (mensis intrans) the days were numbered forward
          from I, while in the other (mensis exiens) they were reckoned
          backward from 30 or 31; (4) the method of Cisiojanus or
          Cisianus, which designated the days of the month by the
          syllables of arbitrary mnemonic verses (long popular in Poland
          and North Germany); (5) the designation of the day by the feast
          celebrated on it. This confusion was worse confounded by the
          various reckonings of Easter, while movable feasts based upon it
          and running side by side with the fixed festivals, or even
          crossing them, added their quota of perplexity.

    4. Early Medieval Calendars.

          In the Middle Ages calendars were multiplied, partly in
          consequence of the chronological intricacies already noted and
          partly because of the universal need for ecclesiastical data of
          this character. It is true that there are few calendars still
          extant which were prepared previous to the eighth century, but
          this deficiency is made good in various ways, especially by the
          sacramentaries which give the list of feasts, while liturgical
          books, particularly manuscripts of the Psalter, frequently have
          a calendar prefixed to them. Such calendars are usually
          perpetual, that is, available for any year, but are usually
          provided with methods for the determination of the movable
          feasts of any particular year. Not only are the letters A-G
          repeated in them from Jan. 1 to designate the days of the week,
          but they also contain the numbers I.-XIX. to denote all new
          moons which fall, in the course of a cycle of nineteen years, on
          the day of the month designated by one of these numbers. By
          means of such a calendar, when the [638]Dominical Letter and the
          [639]Golden Number of the cycle are known, may be obtained the
          day of the week of any date and all new moons throughout the
          year. From the latter is derived the date of the spring new
          moon, which gives, when the day of the week on which it falls is
          determined by the Dominical Letter, the date of Easter. An
          Easter table for a series of years is also frequently added to
          the calendars.

    5. Greek and Slavic Calendars.

          All calendars of the Greek and Slavic churches begin their
          ecclesiastical year, as already noted, with Sept. 1. The great
          majority of their immovable feasts are consecrated to the saints
          and the Virgin, while a number of the movable feasts are
          consecrated to Christ. The latter, like the Sundays of the year,
          are divided into three periods: Trioidion (beginning with the
          tenth Sunday before Easter), Pentekostarion (from Easter to the
          close of the second week after Whitsuntide), and Oktoechos
          (extending from the second Sunday after Whitsuntide into the
          Western Epiphany). The calendar of the Greek Church is
          characterized by numerous fasts, partly of single days and
          partly of several weeks. To the latter belong the four "great
          fasts." Two of these are movable, the Easter fast of seven
          weeks, and the Fast of the Apostles, the latter lasting from the
          Feast of All Martyrs on the Sunday after Whitsuntide to the day
          of SS. Peter and Paul (June 29). The other two, the Fast of the
          Virgin (August 1-15) and the Fast of Advent (Nov. 24-Dec. 24),
          are immovable. In a number of the more important feasts the
          Greek calendar harmonizes with the Western, but it deviates in
          numerous instances from the latter in its dating of the feasts
          of saints and martyrs.

    6. Later Medieval Calendars.

          In the Western Church the majority of calendars were written in
          Latin until the end of the Crusades. Among them special mention
          may be made of the ancient list of feasts prepared at Rome
          during the reign of Gregory II. or Gregory III., and noteworthy
          as giving the Roman stations in which the feasts were celebrated
          and the lessons from the Gospels. Other noteworthy calendars
          include one prepared in 781 by Godesscalc at the command of
          Charlemagne, a calendar from Luxeuil of the latter part of the
          seventh century, a marble calendar drawn up at Naples by Bishop
          John IV. between 840 and 850, and a calendar of Bishop Gundekar
          II. of Eichstätt (1057-79). Among other German calendars mention
          may be made of one from Freising of the latter part of the tenth
          century, from Salzburg in the eleventh century, from Regensburg
          in the twelfth, and from Passau and Augsburg in the thirteenth.
          Toward the end of the Middle Ages the Latin calendars began to
          be translated into the vernacular, although a metrical calendar
          had been written in Anglo-Saxon before the close of the tenth
          century. A French calendar of the thirteenth century is still
          extant in manuscript, but German calendars, which are tolerably
          numerous, are not found until a hundred years later. The
          invention of printing in the fifteenth century wrought important
          changes in the calendar, although the first printed specimens
          resemble those in manuscript and, like them, are perpetual. The
          first calendar for a definite year was printed at Nuremberg in
          1475 in German and Latin. It was designed for the years 1475,
          1494, and 1513 as the first of a triple cycle of nineteen years
          each, and was so constructed that the dates for other years
          might be derived from these three, so that it really extended
          from 1475 to 1531. The ecclesiastical portions, however, were in
          perpetual form, since the calendar contained, in addition to the
          letters A-G for the days of the week, only the names of the
          saints for a limited number of days without a division into
          weeks and without the movable feasts. It was not until the
          middle of the sixteenth century that calendars arranged
          according to the weeks and feasts of a definite year came into
          general use.

    7. Errors in Calculating Easter.

          The reckoning of Easter hitherto employed had long been
          recognized as inadequate, and the elimination of the errors
          which this system had caused was one of the most urgent tasks
          which awaited solution after the close of the Middle Ages. Since
          the second half of the third century the rule had been adopted
          by the Alexandrian Church, and confirmed by the Council of
          Nicæa, that Easter should fall on the Sunday after the spring
          full moon, that is, on the first Sunday after the full moon on
          or next after the vernal equinox. The date of this equinox was
          to be Mar. 21, while the full moon was to be reckoned according
          to a cycle of nineteen years. This system of reckoning was
          introduced into the Roman Church in 525 by Dionysius Exiguus,
          and spread thence throughout Italy, Gaul, and Spain, and was
          given to the Anglo-Saxon churches by Bede in 729. This method,
          however, was vitiated by two faults which could not fail to
          become evident in the course of time. In the first place, by its
          assumption that the vernal equinox falls on Mar. 21 it adopted
          the entire Julian system which makes the year 365¼ days in
          length and intercalates a day every four years. In reality this
          year is eleven minutes too long, so that an extra day is
          intercalated every 128 years. In the send place, by its
          reckoning of the spring full moon according to a nineteen-year
          cycle of 235 months or 6,939¾ days, it made the cycle an hour
          too long, thus making a discrepancy of the day between the real
          and the theoretical new moon every 210 years. It was not until
          the thirteenth century that this error attracted attention, the
          first works to note it being the Computus of Master Conrad in
          1200 (extant only in a revision of 1396 in a Vienna manuscript)
          and the similar work of an anonymous author of 1223 (preserved
          in great part by Vincent of Beauvais). The problem was likewise
          taken up by Johannes de Sacro-Busto about 1250 in his De anni
          ratione and by Roger Bacon in a treatise addressed to Clement
          IV., De reformatione calendarii, while among the Greeks the monk
          Isaac Argyros wrote on the problem in 1272. In the fifteenth
          century the reformation of the calendar was discussed in the
          great councils of the Roman Catholic Church, especially by
          Pierre d'Ailly at Kostnitz in 1414 and by Nicholas of Cusa at
          Basel in 1436, the latter proposing to begin the correction of
          the calendar in 1439.

    8. The Gregorian Reform.

          The actual reform of the calendar was first carried out by
          Gregory XIII. (1572-85) in conformity with a resolution of the
          Council of Trent. In 1577 the pope appointed a committee which
          held its sessions at Rome to carry out the plan proposed by the
          Calabrian astronomer Aloigi Ligli, and confirmed this reformed
          calendar, which was called the Gregorian in his honor, by a bull
          of Feb. 24, 1582. The reform was designed, on the one hand, to
          regulate Easter with reference to the solar and lunar
          revolutions, thus restoring the year of the lunar cycle
          according to the date and intention of the Nicene Council, and,
          on the other, to avoid any future shifting of the vernal equinox
          and the spring full moon. To restore the vernal equinox to Mar.
          21, the ten days between Oct. 4 and 15 were dropped, while for
          the correction of the spring full moon the new moons were set
          back three days from Jan. 3 to Dec. 31. These corrections were
          assured by retaining the Julian system of intercalation and the
          nineteen-year lunar cycle for a century. The intercalary day was
          to be omitted thrice in four centuries, and the new moon was to
          be retarded one day eight times in twenty-five centuries (seven
          times after each three hundred years and the eighth time after
          four hundred). For the correction of the lunar cycle the
          reckoning of epacts, or the age of the moon on Jan. 1, was
          introduced according to the cycle proposed by Ligli.

    9. Opposition to the Gregorian Calendar.

          The Gregorian calendar was adopted in Roman Catholic countries
          either immediately or in the course of a few years. The
          Protestant districts, on the other hand, opposed it, partly on
          account of their hostility to Rome and partly on account of its
          chronological discrepancies. Its inaccuracies were recognized by
          the landgrave William IV. of Hesse-Cassel, and the Calvinistic
          Joseph Justus Scaliger issued repeated warnings against it.
          After the end of the sixteenth century the Julian calendar
          existed in Germany side by side with the Gregorian, the two
          being designated as old and new style, respectively. The movable
          feasts of the two faiths accordingly differed, and the advocates
          of the new style dated the days of the month ten days in advance
          of the old until the end of the seventeenth century. In view of
          the discrepancies between the two systems the German Protestants
          devised a third calendar, which was to agree neither with the
          Gregorian nor the Julian and was to take effect in 1700. In its
          reckoning of time it agreed with the Gregorian, but its feasts
          were calculated astronomically according to the meridian of
          Uraniborg and the Rudolphinian Tables of Kepler. The result was
          increased confusion and embitterment between Roman Catholics and
          Protestants, particularly in 1724, 1744, and 1783, when there
          was a divergency of a week between the Gregorian and the
          astronomical Easter. This Protestant calendar was finally
          suppressed by Frederick the Great in 1775, and the Gregorian
          calendar became supreme throughout Germany. German Protestants
          have sought in recent years to transform Easter into an
          immovable feast, but the plan as yet remains inchoate.

    10. Attempts to Reform the Calendar.

          The evangelical reforms of the calendar thus far considered were
          concerned only with chronology, without regard to the
          traditional Christian lists of saints and martyrs. There is,
          however, a tendency among the Lutherans to revise the hagiology
          of the Church, in view of the Protestant skepticism regarding
          the existence of many of the saints of tradition and the
          Christianity ascribed to others. They are offended, furthermore,
          by the names of such heroes of the Counterreformation as St.
          Ignatius Loyola and other opponents of their sect, while
          prominent Protestants, it is felt, should be recognized in an
          ecclesiastical calendar designed for Lutheran use. Such an
          attempt was made by Ferdinand Piper in his Evangelischer
          Kalender (published from 1850 to 1870), in which he sought to
          transform the hagiology of the Western Church according to
          evangelical ideas. To increase the interest of the laity in this
          new list of names, brief biographies were added, and these, 399
          in number, were later published separately under the title
          Zeugen der Wahrheit (4 vols., Leipsic, 1874; Eng. transl., by H.
          M. MacCracken, 3 vols., Boston, 1879). Piper's calendar,
          however, failed to secure official recognition in any German
          church, although in various revisions it has been included in a
          number of popular calendars in Germany. It is self-evident that
          only partial success can be attained by any Protestant
          hagiological calendar in view of the diversity of Protestant
          conditions and requirements. Apparently, the most that can be
          done is to add new dates and names, whether these be
          supplementary or corrective, to the traditional hagiology of the
          Church, so that, according to the requirements of time or place,
          a choice may be made from the names associated with any
          particular day.

   Calf, The Golden, and Calf-worship

  CALF, THE GOLDEN, AND CALF-WORSHIP.

          Origin of Calf-worship among the Hebrews (§ 1).

          Bull-worship among Other Semites (§ 2).

          Bull-worship in Israel (§ 3).

          Bull-worship in Judah (§ 4).

          The story of the worship of the golden calf during the desert
          journey is given Ex. xxxii. and Deuteronomy ix. 7-21; cf. Neh.
          ix. 18; Ps. cvi. 19-20; Acts vii. 39-40. The authorized
          calf-worship of Northern Israel is mentioned I Kings xii. 28-33;
          II Kings x. 29, xvii. 16; Hos. viii. 5-6, x. 5-6, xiii. 2; II
          Chron. xi. 15, xiii. 8. The Hebrew term generally applied to the
          calf is egel; eglah in Hos. x. 5 is probably a mistake for egel.

    1. Origin of Calf-worship among the Hebrews.

          It has generally been supposed that the Israelites borrowed
          calf-worship from the Egyptians, a supposition thought to be
          supported by the fact that Jeroboam had been recalled from
          Egypt. But the Egyptian animal-worship was essentially different
          from the Semitic type, since the Egyptian worship was paid to
          living animals. The bulls or calves of Jeroboam--the classical
          example in Israel--were, on the other hand, intended to be
          symbols of Yahweh. In any case Jeroboam would not have
          introduced a foreign cult to strengthen his new and precarious
          government. The Hebrew calf-worship did not reproduce the cult
          of Apis and Mnevis, which were living animals, one black, the
          other white, dedicated to Osiris, and he was believed to be
          incarnated in them (J. G. Wilkinson, Manners and Customs of the
          Ancient Egyptians, iii., London, 1878, 86-95, 306-307).
          Suggestions of bull-worship among the Hebrews are found in the
          horns of the altar, in the oxen under the lavers (I Kings vii.
          25), and possibly in the cherubim.

    2. Bull worship among Other Semites.

          While examples of Hebrew bull-worship are rare, the proof of its
          existence among neighboring nations is abundant. In the
          Babylonio-Assyrian and Syro-Phenician religions, the bull
          represented the masculine type of divinity, as was natural to a
          pastoral people. The primitive Aryans also explained the
          heavenly phenomena by comparisons drawn from the life of their
          herds. The Zendavesta makes mention of "the first bull." The
          bull represented power and strength, and at the same time the
          destructive and the reproductive omnipotence of the deity. The
          sun-god is hardly to be recognized in the bull, as has been
          supposed. The gold of the Hebrew bull idols does not necessarily
          point to the splendor of the sun, for the images of other gods
          were also of gold or gilded. Still less credible is the
          assertion that the strength of the bull represented the
          scorching blaze of the sun. Among the Babylonians the bull was
          sacred to the thundergod Ramman (Syrian Rimmon), Assyrian Adad
          (Syrian Hadad), who is represented in Layard's Monuments, plate
          65, as having four horns and holding the lightnings in one hand
          and a battle-ax in the other. The bull is also the emblem of
          Ramman-Adad on the stele of Esarhaddon found at Zingirli in
          Northern Syria, as well as in the procession of the gods
          depicted on the rock at Maltai (cf. G. Perrot and C. Chipiez,
          Histoire de l'art dans l'antiquité, ii., Paris, 1881 sqq.,
          642-643). An image of the Syrian Jupiter of Doliche, which was
          carried from Syria to Rome, represents him standing upon a bull
          (cf. F. Hettner, De Jove Dolicheno dissertatio philologica,
          Bonn, 1877; A. H. Kan, De Jovis Dolicheni Cultu dissertatio,
          Groningen, 1901). The Jupiter of Hierapolis in Syria was
          pictured sitting upon bulls (Lucian, De dea Syria, xxxi.). The
          classical tale of the seduction of Europa is a form of the Baal
          myth, in which the god, in the shape of a bull, journeys with
          [644]Astarte to Crete (for the identity of Astarte with Europa,
          cf. De dea Syria, lv.). The sacredness of cattle among the
          Philistines also is demonstrated by the story of the return of
          the ark on a new cart drawn by two milch kine, on which there
          had come no yoke (I Sam. vi. 7 sqq.).

    3. Bull worship in Israel.

          That bull-worship among the Hebrews was ancient the foregoing
          makes quite possible. It was, however, hardly practised before
          the final settlement in Canaan, since it was always
          characteristic of peoples who had either reached or passed the
          agricultural stage. The prohibition of the Book of the Covenant
          (Ex. xx. 23, cf. xxxiv.17) is, therefore, the first warning
          against this type of worship. Ex. xxxii. assumes, however, that
          it was practised during the journey in the wilderness. The
          leading features of the narrative are as follows: The people had
          become impatient under the continued absence of their leader,
          and Aaron made for them an image of the god who had led them out
          of Egypt. With the material furnished by the golden earrings of
          the women and children, "a molten calf" was fashioned, before
          which an altar was built, and to it divine honors were paid. The
          rest of the chapter tells of Yahweh's anger, of Moses's
          energetic intervention, of Aaron's apology, and finally of the
          destruction of the calf and of 3,000 of its worshipers. The
          narrative--a composite of J and E--has been, however, considered
          by many modern critics as unhistorical and really a polemic
          against Jeroboam's newly instituted worship. The cardinal
          passage on calf-worship is I Kings xii. 28-29 (cf. II Chron. xi.
          15), where the story is told of the bulls set up by Jeroboam I.,
          who ordained a non-levitical priesthood, and did not pretend to
          do more than return to the Yahweh-worship of the past. That he
          did thus return is proved by his success. When Jehu destroyed
          the Baal-worship, he did not touch the bulls, a clear proof that
          he acknowledged the bull-worship as Yahweh-worship (II Kings x.
          29). Yet the spiritual prophets opposed the bull-worship from
          the beginning. Indirect testimony to this may be seen in Amos
          (v. 5). Direct testimony is first found in Hosea. This younger
          contemporary of Amos is the only one of the prophets who alludes
          to bull-worship; and to him the worship of an image is the
          worship of an idol (viii. 5-6, xiii. 2, cf. x. 5-6). With regard
          to the precise form and structure of Jeroboam's bulls there is
          no direct information. Gold being scarce and precious, it is
          probable that the images were small--an assumption supported by
          the fact that they are called calves. Naturally these royal
          statues would be of pure gold and not merely gilded.

    4. Bull worship in Judah.

          In the kingdom of Judah bull-worship does not seem to have
          flourished, for nowhere is found a reference to Judaic worship
          of this kind, and the polemics of Hosea exclusively against the
          calf of Samaria at Bethel would be unintelligible, had he been
          aware of the same cult in Judah. The Deuteronomic redactor of
          the book of Kings saw in the bull-worship the special sin of
          Jeroboam, wherewith he caused Israel to sin (I Kings xiv. 16,
          xv. 26).

   Calixtus
          CALIXTUS, c?-lix´tUs: The name of three popes and one antipope.

          Calixtus (Callistus) I.: Pope 217-222. Through the discovery of
          the work of [648]Hippolytus on heresies, a new aspect, differing
          in many particulars from the traditional one, has been assumed
          by the story of this early bishop. The old account ascribed to
          him the building of the church of Santa Maria in Trastevere. The
          [649]Pseudo-Isidorian Decretals contain two in which, among
          other things, regulations are laid down for the ember fasts. He
          was called a martyr, but the sets of his martyrdom are purely
          legendary, probably composed in the seventh century. The picture
          given by Hippolytus, though bitterly hostile, is at least clear
          and sharp in its outlines. According to it, Callistus was the
          slave of a Christian official named Carpophorus, who entrusted
          him with considerable sums of money, which he lost. Taking
          flight to avoid a reckoning, he was pursued by his master, and
          jumped into the sea to escape him, but was pulled out and
          condemned to the treadmill. Then he got into a quarrel with the
          Jews in Rome, and was beaten and sent to the mines of Sardinia,
          from which he was released by the influence of Marcia, the
          mistress of Commodus. It is impossible to determine how far
          Callistus was morally blameworthy in this chequered
          career--probably not as much as Hippolytus says. The events
          recited are said to have happened in the pontificate of Victor.
          The next bishop, Zephyrinus, brought Callistus back to Rome,
          probably already in orders, and gave him charge of the large
          cemetery which later bore his name. Under Zephyrinus he came
          into conflict with Hippolytus on the dogma of the Incarnation
          (see [650]Monarchianism); and at the next vacancy a schism
          occurred, each party electing its own leader as bishop (see
          [651]Hippolytus). Callistus seems to have been, like Zephyrinus,
          a Modalist; it was he who excommunicated Sabellius. The question
          of discipline also brought him into conflict with Hippolytus,
          according to whom he laid down the principle, unacceptable to
          the rigorists of the time, that all sins might be forgiven, and
          denied the necessity of deposing a bishop who should be guilty
          of deadly sin. Hippolytus accuses him of taking this position so
          as to increase the numbers of his own church; but it is
          undeniable that a clear-sighted man could hardly fail to see the
          defects and inconsistencies of the then existing church
          discipline, and Callistus was probably seeking to establish a
          more logical system. The Catalogus Liberianus is authority for
          placing his death in 222. [The largest of the Roman catacombs is
          the Cemetery of St. Callistus; and De Rossi says it was the
          first common cemetery, given to the pope by some noble family
          for the use of the whole Christian community. Thirteen out of
          the next eighteen popes after Zephyrinus are said to have been
          buried there.]

          Calixtus II. (Gui, or Wido, son of Count William of Burgundy):
          Pope 1119-24. He was made archbishop of Vienne in 1088, and
          under Paschal II. was legate in England, with little success. In
          the investiture controversy he was one of the leaders of the
          French opposition to the compromise of 1111 with Henry V. A
          synod called by him at Vienne in that year condemned lay
          investiture without reserve and excommunicated Henry,
          threatening the pope with renunciation of allegiance if he did
          not confirm its decrees. When he was elected pope by the
          cardinals assembled at Cluny (Feb. 2, 1119), Henry had reason to
          fear the accession of a second Hildebrand. He made conciliatory
          overtures to the new pontiff, offering to submit the controversy
          to a council called by Calixtus, and approved an agreement with
          the papal representatives by which, in return for the revocation
          of his excommunication, he surrendered his claims to the right
          of investiture. But the agreement proved impossible of
          execution, and soon, in a great council held at Reims (Oct. 29
          and 30, 1119), Calixtus renewed his denial of the right and his
          excommunication of Henry and of Antipope Gregory VIII. Though
          the sentence remained ineffective in Germany, Calixtus
          strengthened his authority in France during his stay there,
          finding a firm ally in Louis the Fat. He went to Italy in the
          spring of 1120, and entered Rome in triumph, Gregory VIII.
          fleeing to Sutri, whose citizens delivered him up to his
          victorious rival in the following April. This strengthened
          Calixtus's position still more against the emperor; but the
          final decision of the contest was brought about by the
          intervention of the German princes, assembled at Würzburg in the
          autumn of 1121. They counseled Henry to acknowledge Calixtus and
          the canonically elected bishops, undertaking in return to
          arrange a peace with the Church, and proposing the convocation
          of a general council, in which they promised to defend the honor
          of the Empire. Calixtus appointed Lambert of Ostia and two other
          cardinals to conduct the negotiations, which began at Worms in
          Sept., 1122. Archbishop Adalbert of Mainz continued to urge the
          strict Hildebrandine position and it was due to Lambert's work
          alone that the discussion, instead of being fruitless, led to
          the Concordat of Worms (see [652]Concordats and Delimiting
          Bulls, I, § 1). This was solemnly confirmed by Calixtus in the
          First Lateran Council, opened on Mar. 18, 1123, which also
          renewed the canons against simony and clerical marriage, and
          proclaimed a "truce of God" and a new crusade. While the plans
          for this undertaking were being made, Calixtus died, Dec. 13 or
          14, 1124.

          Calixtus III. (Alonso de Borja or Borgia): Pope 1455-58. Born at
          Xativa in Valencia [Dec. 31, 1378]. After a legal education he
          became bishop of Valencia in 1429 and cardinal in 1444. On Apr.
          8, 1455, being then seventy-seven years old, he was elected
          pope. He was s man of simple and blameless life, but too weak to
          cope with the disorders of the time, some of which arose
          directly from his own partiality for his relatives. Immediately
          after his accession, he took a vow to carry forward a war
          against the Turks and atone for the manner in which Europe had
          looked on supinely at the fall of Constantinople. Legates were
          sent throughout the Continent to preach a crusade and collect
          troops and money. Money, indeed, came in, especially through the
          help of the mendicant orders, in large sums; but the old
          crusading zeal had died down too far to be rekindled. The tithes
          which were required, on behalf of the undertaking, from the
          clergy of France and Germany aroused universal discontent. The
          doctors of the University of Paris and the clergy of Rouen
          appealed in 1456 to a general council against the tax, and a
          similar appeal was made in Germany, not only on this ground but
          on that of the failure to observe the Vienna Concordat of 1448
          in regard to the system of clerical benefices. While endeavoring
          to put down this rebellious spirit, Calixtus succeeded in
          assembling a small fleet which sailed (May 31, 1456) to help the
          Knights of St. John in their dangerous position at Rhodes. The
          fleet, under the command of the cardinal legate Scarampo,
          occupied some small islands of the Grecian archipelago, without
          venturing on a decisive engagement. The Greeks had not the
          courage to rise in force, and the Christian princes and Italian
          cities took but a languid interest in the crusade. It was a
          piece of luck that the victory of the heroic Hunyadi at Belgrade
          (July 14 and 21, 1456) averted the most pressing peril. The pope
          was hindered by the consequences of his hostility to Alfonso of
          Naples, after whose death (June 27, 1458) he refused to
          acknowledge the claim of Alfonso's natural son Fernando,
          asserting that the kingdom reverted as a fief of the papacy to
          himself. This attitude was the outcome of his desire to advance
          his own nephews, one of whom, Rodrigo (the future Alexander
          VI.), he had made cardinal and vice-chancellor of the Roman
          Church in spite of his being below the canonical age; another,
          Pedro, he had made duke of Spoleto, destining the Neapolitan
          crown for him. Calixtus died, however (Aug. 6, 1458), before his
          unscrupulous designs could break the peace of Italy. His nephews
          and their Spanish followers left Rome, where, in alliance with
          the Colonna family, they had been guilty of incessant crimes and
          violence.

   Calixtus, Georg
          CALIXTUS, GEORG: The most influential continuator of
          Melanchthon's theology in the seventeenth century, spokesman of
          the so-called "syncretism" in Germany at that time; b. at
          Medelbye (in the district of Tondern, 115 m. n.n.w. of Hamburg),
          Schleswig, Dec. 14, 1586; d. at Helmstädt, Brunswick, March 19,
          1656. His father, pastor at Medelbye, a pupil of Melanchthon,
          wished to have his son educated in the same way, and after due
          preparation sent him to the university at Helmstädt, where
          like-minded friends of Melanchthon, eg., the humanist Caselius,
          were still in office. From 1603 to 1607 he studied philology and
          philosophy, then theology, paying especial attention to the
          study of early patristics. From 1609 to 1613 he traveled in
          Germany, Belgium England, and France, enlarging his ideas, and
          becoming acquainted with the conditions of the Reformed and
          Roman Catholic churches, comparing them with those of the
          Lutheran Church to which he belonged. Thus he developed an
          irenic tendency which he retained all his life. He was appointed
          in 1614 professor of theology at Helmstädt, and remained there
          until his death. A memorial tablet on his house in the little
          city in the duchy of Brunswick commemorates the activity of this
          enlightened mind. His life fell in the age of the
          Counterreformation and the Thirty Years' War, when the hatred of
          the confessions toward each other had reached its height. The
          main effort of this irenic theologian was inspired by the ides
          that theology must have for its prime object not so much pure
          doctrine as Christian life. Thus he became the creator of
          theological ethics as a special theological discipline, and
          therein undoubtedly marks an epoch in the progress of theology;
          most moral philosophers still follow him in this formal
          principle. But the danger was thereby incurred of detaching
          ethics from dogmatics and building the former without the
          necessary religious foundation. In the second place he
          endeavored to bring about a union of all Christian churches,
          taking the Apostles' Creed and the consensus of the first five
          centuries as a dogmatically and ecclesiastically sufficient
          norm. He aspired to a union of all Christian confessions. For
          this reason he took part in the Conference of Thorn (see
          [654]Thorn, Conference of) in 1645, where, however, he found
          that the Lutherans would not work with him, since they felt
          justifiably that from his point of view the Reformation lost its
          essential importance: a religious indifferentism would be the
          obvious sequence, and it is certainly no accident that during
          the seventeenth century many princes and princesses left the
          Lutheran Church and joined the Roman Catholic (John Frederick of
          Hanover, Christine of Sweden, the daughter of Gustavus Adolphus,
          and some others). On the other hand the orthodox, not altogether
          from combativeness, endeavored to maintain the religious content
          of the Reformation; this is their merit against all syncretism.
          Finally Calixtus made himself a name in scientific dogmatics by
          introducing the analytical method. After his death the
          syncretistic controversies continued till they lost their
          interest through the Pietistic movement. Among his numerous
          writings those of most interest are his academical orations
          Orationes selectæ (Helmstädt, 1660); his influential exegetical
          writings, Expositiones and Lucubrationtes on New and Old
          Testament books; and, of his irenic writings, the Judicium de
          controversiis theologicis quæ inter Lutheranos et Reformatos
          agitantur, et de mutua partium fraternitate atque tolerantia
          propter consensum in fundamentis (1650). His son and successor,
          Friedrich Ulrich Calixtus (b. 1622; d. 1701), tried to continue
          the work of his father, but met with no approval among the
          Lutherans. They rather tried to supplant syncretism in the
          Lutheran Church by a new orthodox confession, Consensus
          repetitus fidei vere Lutheranæ. But this confession, which would
          have turned the Church into an orthodox school, was nowhere
          officially accepted. The syncretistic controversy remained for a
          long time of such importance that no interest was felt in the
          Pietistic principles which soon sprang up. This can be
          understood only from the course of the syncretistic
          controversies. See [655]Syncretism.

          at Ottery Saint Mary (12 m. e.n.e. of Exeter) Mar. 26, 1890. In
          early life he was a Quaker, and after teaching from 1835 to
          1839, was successively a chemist's assistant and a surgeon's
          assistant. He then studied surgery and was licensed by the Royal
          College of Surgeons in 1842 and by the Apothecaries' Society two
          years later. In 1852, however, failing health obliged him to
          sell his lucrative practise and to spend a year in France. In
          the following year he graduated M.D. at King's College,
          Aberdeen, and determined to be a physician, but his interest in
          missions becoming active, he was ordered deacon in 1854, having
          left the Society of Friends for the Church of England two years
          previously, and went as missionary to Africa. He was first
          stationed at Ekukanyeni near Pietermaritzburg, but on being
          priested in 1855 was made rector of St. Andrew's,
          Pietermaritzburg. Three years later he obtained a grant of land
          beyond the Umkomanzi River and settled at Insunguze, which he
          renamed Spring Vale. There he began his studies of Zulu religion
          and customs, but was recalled to England in 1873 to be
          consecrated first missionary bishop of St. John's, Kaffraria. In
          the following year he left England, and in 1876 removed the seat
          of the diocese to Umtata, where he founded St. John's
          Theological College in 1879. His fragile health, however, had
          already necessitated the consecration of Bransby Key as
          bishop-coadjutor in 1873, and in 1886 Callaway resigned his see
          and returned to England in the following year, settling at
          Ottery Saint Mary, where he spent the remainder of his life. He
          wrote: Immediate Revelation (London, 1841); Memoir of James
          Parnell (1846); Nursery Tales, Traditions, and Histories of the
          Zulus (Spring Vale, 1868); The Religious System of the Amazulu
          (Natal, 1868-70); and Missionary Sermons (London, 1875). He
          likewise translated the book of Psalms (Natal, 1871) and the
          Book of Common Prayer (1882) into Zulu.

          Halle July 16, 1760. He was educated at Halle, where in 1727 he
          was appointed associate professor of philology, becoming full
          professor in 1735 and being transferred to the faculty of
          theology four years later. His deep interest in Protestant
          missions among the Jews and Mohammedans of the East led him, in
          1728, to found the Institutum Judaicum for the education of
          missionaries. To this institution, which lasted until 1791 and
          was instrumental in the conversion of a large number of Jews, he
          later attached, at his own expense, a press for the promotion of
          the cause. Europe, as well as parts of Asia and Africa, was
          traversed by his pupils, for whom he printed Arabic translations
          of portions of the Old Testament, the whole of the New
          Testament, "The Imitation of Christ," and other works. His
          propaganda among the Mohammedans, however, met with little
          success. His independent works, which are of minor importance,
          include: Kurze Anleitung zur jüdisch-teutschen Sprache (Halle,
          1733); Berichte von einem Versuch das jüdische Volk zur
          Erkenntniss des Christlichen anzuleiten (3 vols., 1728-36); and

   Calling
          CALLING (vocation; Lat. vocatio, Gk. klesis): In dogmatic
          language as well as in the practical usage of the Church that
          act of divine grace (gratia applicatrix) with which the ordo
          salutis (see [656]Order of Salvation) begins.

    Biblical Usage.

          The Greek terms kalein, kletos, klesis are often used both in
          the Septuagint and in the New Testament in the sense of calling
          (e.g., Matt. ix. 13; Acts iv. 18), then of summoning to court,
          of inviting to dinner, etc. (e.g., III Macc. v. 14; Matt. xxii.
          4, 8; Rev. xix. 9). But even in the Old Testament usage the
          Hebrew k?ara' or the Greek kalein has the meaning of calling
          some one effectually for some purpose (cf. Isa. xlii. 6, xlviii.
          12, xlix. 1, li. 2), which may signify "to call into existence"
          (Wisd. of Sol. xi. 25; Baruch iii. 33, 34; cf. Ps. xxxiii. 9).
          From this point the solemn usage of the New Testament takes its
          departure. The call proceeds from God; it comes to man through
          the word of preaching, which is not the word of man but of God
          (I Cor. i. 9; II Pet. i. 3; I Thess. ii. 13; II Thess. ii. 14).
          Inasmuch as the call comes from God, it is a "holy calling" (II
          Tim. i. 9), a "heavenly calling" (Heb. iii. 1), a "high calling
          of God in Christ Jesus" (Phil. iii. 14). The call is a free act
          of the grace of God (Rom. ix. 11), in which the divine election
          and predestination realize themselves (II Thess. ii. 13, 14; II
          Tim. i. 9-10; Rom. viii. 30). From this it is clear that it is
          always the effectual calling that is thought of; indeed it is
          precisely the divine election of grace which is made manifest in
          the calf. Hence those who became Christians were "called to be
          saints" (Rom. i. 7; I Cor. i. 2, cf. Jude 1: "called and kept").
          That to which the Christians are called, or that which
          constitutes the content of the call is the blessing of the New
          Testament salvation, and this is expressed in the most diverse
          terms: to communion with Christ (I Cor. i. 9); to salvation (II
          These. ii. 14); to the peace of Christ (Col. iii. 15); to the
          kingdom and glory of God (I Thess. ii. 12); out of the darkness
          into a wonderful light (I Pet. ii. 9); to eternal life, to his
          glory and his inheritance (I Tim. vi. 12; I Pet. v. 10; Heb. ix.
          15); to the hope of his calling (Eph. i. 18, iv. 4).

          Inasmuch as the call indicates the New Testament salvation, it
          also procures the moral change comprehended in that blessing. As
          on the human side obedience corresponds to the call (Heb. xi.
          6), so we are called "not for uncleanness, but in
          sanctification" (I Thess. iv. 7); the Christian's life is to be
          holy "as he who called you is holy" (I Pet. i. 15). If,
          therefore, the call is the effectual invitation of God to man,
          conveyed through the Word, for the kingdom and its blessings, so
          that everyone possessing these came by them through the call,
          the call, on the other baud, points beyond itself to the
          realization through God or through man: "Faithful is he that
          calleth you who also will do it" (I Thess. v. 24) and "give the
          more diligence to make your calling and election sure" (II Pet.
          i. 10).

    By the Reformers.

          Luther's use of the expression in the exposition of the third
          article of his Shorter Catechism is important for the history of
          the conception. But the term did not immediately receive on that
          account an independent place in dogmatics. In the older
          Protestant literature it is used in connection with election and
          the Church. It seems to have received a firm place in dogmatics
          for the first time in Hutter (Compendium, XIII. v. 8). According
          to Calovius it opens the ordo salutis, and he defines it
          (Systema, x. 1) as an "effectual bringing in to the Church" (ad
          ecclesiam efficax adductio), whereas Hollaz (Examen theologicum,
          III. i. 4, quæstio 1) makes it an offer of benefits by Christ.
          Moreover, a distinction is made between the vocatio generalis,
          which through nature, etc., comes to all men, and the vocatio
          specialis, which comes through the Gospel. The latter may be
          ordinaria, i.e., through the Word, or extraordinaria, and that
          immediata or mediata. The call is seria and efficax (in
          opposition to the view of the Reformed), inasmuch as the Spirit
          regularly becomes effectual in the Word. It is, moreover,
          universalis. That many peoples do without it is their own fault.
          Then comes the doubtful contention that since Adam all peoples
          in one way or another have been given the opportunity of hearing
          the Gospel (the above is from Hollaz; for a full discussion cf.
          H. Schmid, Die Dogmatik der evangelisch-lutherisehen Kirche,
          Gütersloh, 1893, 320 sqq.).

    In Dogmatics.

          Dogmatically considered, the doctrine of vocation is only the
          application of the doctrine of the Word of God to conversion.
          Therefore, this conception will disclose no new dogmatic
          knowledge, but will only offer a confirmation of such things as
          have been acquired elsewhere. But because the Scriptures often
          apply the term and because it has through the catechism gone
          over into the popular religious consciousness, its right to a
          special treatment in dogmatics is not to be denied. The call
          takes place the very moment a person--be he a non-Christian or
          be he externally connected with Christianity--becomes aware that
          the heard (or read) Word as the Word of God efficaciously works
          in him the divine will unto salvation, and as there is no
          conceivable moment in the Christian life in which that
          revelation of salvation in the Word becomes superfluous, the
          vocation will be a continual one and the Christian will always
          remain a vocatus. We may, therefore, confine the conception to
          the opening of the new life; but, starting from the thought of
          the Word of God, we must define the call as that influence of
          God upon man, through the medium of the Word, which makes the
          beginning of the new life and conditions its continuation and
          its completion. The call brings us the whole salvation as the
          passages of Scripture above cited show. If dogmaticians as a
          rule, in speaking of vocation, think only of the first influence
          of God, this must be supplemented by the fact that this term
          comprehends within itself the further divine activities. If now
          the call embraces the whole of salvation in its relation to us,
          it is plain that its content is the Gospel; as the old writers
          rightly perceived. But since "law" and Gospel stand in close
          connection, the law also must be indirectly included in the
          call.

          R. Seeberg.

          CALLING, EARTHLY: The position in life occupied by each
          individual, and the duties toward society which appertain to
          such a position. These duties are primarily social rather than
          ethical, and may be hedonistic in motive, as when they are
          performed for the sake of livelihood. The calling may be
          ethicized, however, if the ends of the social organism be served
          expressly for the glory of God, thus transforming the calling
          into divine worship. Since the calling conditions the class of
          services rendered to society, it must form the basis of an
          ethical activity. Each function resulting from the divinely
          created nature of man may develop into a calling, although the
          variety in callings does not necessarily imply a distinction in
          the value of personalities. Nor is it unethical to have no
          calling, but only to desire to have none, since those who are so
          conditioned that, through no volition of their own, they are
          without a calling do not become unethical for that reason.

          In the rich development of Christian ethics in the New Testament
          the earthly calling is comparatively neglected, yet, from the
          point of view of love toward one's neighbor, he who disregards
          his duties to his family, and toward society and the Church,
          must he considered unethical. The earthly calling is,
          accordingly, individualistic rather than universal in its
          obligations to society, and represents one of the forms of
          Christian ethics. Wilful neglect of the calling is immoral,
          since it is the only means of intercommunication in society,
          which would otherwise be incoherent and disorganized. The bodily
          and mental gifts of man are fruitless unless they are devoted to
          the welfare of society through a definite calling, and their
          neglect is not only contrary to nature but also to the will of
          God.

          The ethical signification of the earthly calling forms an
          important chapter of philosophical ethics. Through its
          recognition of the dignity of labor and the worth of the
          individual, Christianity revolutionized the ethics of the pagan
          world, although the full ethical evaluation of the calling began
          only at the Reformation. Since God is served less by self-chosen
          cults than by the ethical obedience which he himself has
          commanded (Isa. i. 11-17; Hos. vi. 6; Matt. ix. 13, xii. 7), the
          believing Christian performs a true worship corresponding to his
          estate as a child of God in his faithful performance of his
          calling. In a certain sense the principles of the ethical value
          of the fulfilment of the calling are merely a renewal of the New
          Testament doctrine that the Christian confirmation of faith
          through love bears a distinct and active relation to society (I
          Cor. vii. 20-24; Eph. vi. 5 sqq.; I Pet. ii. 12 sqq.), even
          though nowhere in the New Testament is earthly calling
          specifically mentioned. The distinction of callings begins in
          the family, whence it develops successively into the acquisition
          and control of temporal benefits and into the charge over
          intellectual and spiritual blessings in religion, science, and
          art, the culmination being the constitution of society as a
          whole. Yet the individual can not make free choice of his own
          calling, but is restricted by certain social limitations; still,
          other things being equal, that calling should be chosen which is
          most in harmony both with talents and inclination. External
          conditions, however, frequently render impossible the
          development of the most gifted talent, yet in such cases there
          is no reason for the formation of a religious and moral
          personality to suffer injury, since such adverse circumstances
          demand full and complete fidelity to the calling, and thus
          strengthen true Christian piety, instead of impairing it.

   Calmet, Augustin
          CALMET, AUGUSTIN: French Roman Catholic theologian and author;
          b. at Mesnil-la-Horgne (a village near Commercy, 25 m. e. of
          Bar-le-Duc) Feb. 26, 1672; d. at Senones (7 m. n.e. of St. Dié)
          Oct. 25, 1757. He was a Benedictine monk of the congregation of
          St. Vannes, and studied at the priory of Breuil, while he
          learned Hebrew from the Protestant clergyman Favre. After 1698
          he instructed the pupils of the order in theology and philosophy
          at the abbey of Moyen-Moutier in the Vosges, and in 1704 was
          appointed subprior at Münster. Fourteen years later the general
          chapter of his order made him abbot of St. Leopold at Nancy,
          whence he was transferred in 1728 to Senones, and there he
          passed the remainder of his life. His numerous works give
          evidence of extraordinary reading and erudition, but lack
          critical ability and insight. His best writings are devoted to
          the interpretation of the Bible according to the principles of
          the Council of Trent. To this category belongs his La Sainte
          Bible en Latin et en francais avec un commentaire littéral et
          critique (23 vols., Paris, 1707-16), the French translation
          being that of Sacy and the commentary giving simply a
          grammatical exegesis. The excursuses on each book, dealing with
          chronology, history, antiquities, and similar topics, were the
          most valuable portion of the work, and were published separately
          under the title Dissertations qui peuvent servir de prolégomènes
          à l'Écriture Sainte (3 vols., 1720), and the Trésor d'antiquités
          sacrées et profanes des commentaires du P. Calmet (13 vols.,
          Amsterdam, 1722) is the same work with a different arrangement.
          The notes scattered in the commentaries are collected in
          alphabetical order in the Dictionnaire historique et critique,
          chronologique, géographique et littéral de la Bible (2 vols.,
          Paris, 1722, supplement, 1728; Eng. transl., 3 vols., London,
          1732), which long remained the quarry for similar works. Less
          important are the Histoire sainte de l'Ancien et du Nouveau
          Testament et des Juifs (2 vols., 1718) and the Histoire
          universelle sacrée et profane (17 vols., Strasburg, Senones, and
          Nancy, 1735-71). Calmet's works are now little read, with the
          exception of the Histoire ecclésiastique et civile de la
          Lorraine (4 vols., Nancy, 1728), which is based on archives and
          accompanied with valuable documents.

    Education and Early Professorial Activity.

          He was driven away by the plague from the first two schools he
          attended, at Thorn and at Königsberg, but he prosecuted his
          studies at home to such good purpose that when barely fourteen
          he was able to enter the University of Königsberg. Here he took
          his master's degree six years later, and was at once taken into
          the philosophical faculty. He lectured on philosophy and
          mathematics, while eagerly continuing the study of theology. His
          polemical activity began with a tractate against the Reformed
          court preacher Berg (1635). In 1634 he migrated to the
          University of Rostock, of which he became a doctor in 1637. Then
          he returned to Königsberg, was made assessor to the theological
          faculty, and resumed his lectures. Two years later he became
          adjunct professor, and visitor of the Samland district; in 1643
          he went to Danzig as rector of the gymnasium there and pastor of
          Trinity Church. He was a delegate to the Thorn Conference of
          1645, where he came in contact with Calixtus. From this time on
          a great part of his life was devoted to polemical activity,
          especially against [657]Syncretism and Calvinism.

    Calovius at Wittenberg.

          In 1650, at the invitation of the elector John George I., he
          went to Wittenberg, where the rest of his life was to be spent.
          He began there as third professor and preacher at the parish
          church, of which he became pastor in 1652 and general
          superintendent of the district, and by 1660 he was head
          professor and dean of the faculty. The university increased
          considerably in numbers through the attraction of his teaching,
          though the increase fell off when the elector of Brandenburg
          forbade his subjects (1662) to go there for theology or
          philosophy, on account of the opposition of the principia
          Caloviana to the Reformed teaching. An iron constitution enabled
          him to work incessantly at his books and lectures, as well as to
          support the loss of five wives and thirteen children and to
          marry again at the age of seventy-two.

    His Controversial Writings.

          A complete record of his activity is left in his books, since he
          nearly always expanded his lectures into that form. His
          polemical activity was directed chiefly against the Syncretistic
          school of Helmstädt and its Königsberg allies Behm, Dreier, and
          Latermann, as well as later against the Hessian friends of
          Calixtus. He had paid his compliments to the latter's teaching
          even in his Danzig days, and in his Institutionum theologicarum
          prolegomena (2 parts, 1649-50). More important onslaughts on
          this school were Synopsis controversiarum potiarum (1652), with
          an introduction specially directed against Calixtus;
          Syncretismus Calixtinus (1653); and Harmonia Calixtina-hæretica
          (1655), in which he accuses the "innovators" not merely of
          tolerating false doctrine but of teaching it themselves, and
          proves his point by attempting to show their "harmony" with
          Calvinists and Papists, Armenians and Socinians. By the date of
          this publication Calovius thought the time was ripe for a step
          which he had been urging for four years. The Consensus repetitus
          fidei veræ Lutheranæ is undoubtedly in its essence the work of
          Calovius, in its first as well as in its final form. The purpose
          of this new dogmatic standard, the exclusion of the Syncretists
          from the Church and so from the protection of the religious
          truce, was not attained; in fact; after 1655, and still more
          after 1669, when definite instructions were conveyed to the
          Wittenberg theologians to restrain their polemical ardor, there
          is a noticeable slackening of anti-Syncretist activity; and
          Calovius turned his attention rather to the Jena school, and
          especially to Musæus. In 1682, finally, he published a complete
          account of the whole controversy is his Historia syncretistica.
          Owing to the prohibition of polemical publications, it appeared
          without any author's name or place of printing, described merely
          as the work of "D. A. C. [Dr. Abraham Calovius], a distinguished
          theologian." The elector John George III., who objected on
          political grounds to such literature, had all the copies bought
          up, so that this edition is very rare. A second edition appeared
          in 1685, with Calovius's approval and with his name on the
          title-page. He attacked the Roman Catholics in his Matæologia
          papistica (1647), and the Socinians in several small works,
          which when collected (1684) filled two folio volumes. As if the
          conflict within his own Church did not give him enough to do, he
          interposed in the controversies of the Calvinists with his
          Consideratio Arminianismi (1655) and his Theses theologicæ de
          Labbadismo (1681). His last work, the Anti-Boehmius (1684),
          directed against Jakob Boehme, shows a failure in power.

    His Constructive Theology.

          In the way of constructive theology, his Systema locorum
          theologicorum (12 vols., 1655-77) is, with the possible
          exception of Gerhard's, the most important dogmatic production
          of the century--the true exemplar of what has been called
          Lutheran scholasticism. It takes the Lutheran doctrine, as it
          had developed on the basis of the Formula Concordiæ and the
          Scriptural principles, pushed to their extreme since the
          Regensburg conference of 1601, and defends it with unyielding
          logic and firmness against the intellectual forces of a new age.
          Even his principal exegetical work, the Biblia illustrata (4
          vols., 1672-76), has a polemical bearing, being intended to
          correct the Annotata of Hugo Grotius, which is incorporated in
          it. He accomplishes his task with great acuteness, wonderful
          learning, and more feeling for the sense of Scripture than his
          opponent, whose preference was for secular authors, but with his
          inevitable dogmatic limitations.

    Estimate of Calovius.

          The circumstances of his life render it difficult to pronounce a
          summary judgment on the man and his career. The party of
          Calixtus naturally hated and despised him; but the fact that
          they found it necessary to spread absurd fictions about his
          horrible end shows clearly enough that nothing could justly be
          said against his personal character. In his own day he compelled
          the respect and admiration of a great variety of men, and his
          talents have been fully recognized by some who were far from
          agreeing with him, like Buddeus, Walch, and Stäudlin. His
          incessant controversial activity has left a misleading
          impression of him; he himself says of this branch of his work,
          "I come to this kind of writing unwillingly and by force; my
          disposition inclines me rather to stick to positive doctrinal
          work." As a theologian he was a faithful member of the
          Wittenberg school. No one has insisted more on the necessity of
          a Scriptural basis for all teaching. It is true, of course, that
          the defects of Lutheran orthodoxy--its hardness and its
          extremes--are to be found in him. Faith is essentially the
          acceptance of the orthodox system; not only the essentials (and
          they covered a great deal of ground in those days), but every
          derived article must be accepted, for the faith is one. The
          standard books of doctrine are theoretically subordinate to the
          Scriptures; but the student is required to accept them not
          hypothetically but categorically--not in so far as, but because,
          they agree with the Bible. His firm conviction of the truth of
          his system gives, however, a certain dignity to his polemics;
          but his untiring activity never reached its aim--he did not
          succeed in raising the Consensus repetitus to the dignity of a
          creed, and a new era had dawned before he went to his rest.

   Calvary, Mount, Orders of
          CALVARY, MOUNT, ORDERS OF: Three religious orders taking their
          name from the Mount of Crucifixion.

          1. The Calvarists or Priests of Mt. Calvary: An association of
          secular priests founded by Hubert Charpentier at Mt. Bétharam,
          diocese of Lescar (4 m. n.w. by w. of Pau), France, in 1633 "in
          commemoration of the sufferings of Christ and for the spread of
          the Catholic faith," five years later united with a similar
          association formed in Paris by a Capuchin named Hyacinthe,
          primarily to convert Protestants. The chief seat of the united
          orders was Mont Valérien, Paris (hence popularly called Colline
          du Calvaire). They perished in the French Revolution.

          2. The Nuns of Mt. Calvary (Bénédictines de Notre-Dame du
          Calvaire): Founded by Antoinette d'Orléans (d. 1618) and the
          Capuchin Joseph de Clerc de Tremblay in 1617 at Poitiers,
          properly a branch of the [659]Order of Fontévraud. In the
          seventeenth century they had about twenty houses which were
          destroyed in the French Revolution. Since then the order has
          been revived and has a number of convents mostly in western
          France.

          3. The Daughters of Mt. Calvary (Figlie del Calvario): Founded
          at Genoa in 1619 by Virginia Centurione (d. 1651), daughter of
          the doge of Genoa and wife of Grimaldi Bracelli, who undertook
          the care of abandoned children in a time of great distress from
          famine. She received help from the Marchese Emanuele Brignole,
          from whom the members of the order were called Le suore Brignole
          in Genoa. They spread in North Italy, were given a house in Rome
          by Gregory XVI. in 1833, and later established orphan asylums at
          Rieti and Viterbo.

          Missionary Society in 1838 to go to Fiji he was master of the
          printing and bookbinding trades and had been in 1837 a student
          in the Hoxton Academy. His industrial training stood him in good
          stead for he was able to do his own printing in Fiji and issue
          many books, among them a translation of the New Testament into
          the vernacular. He lived to see the complete abandonment of
          heathenism by the Fijians, a result to which his heroic labors
          contributed largely. From 1865 to 1872 he was supernumerary
          minister at Bromley, Kent, England, thence he went as missionary
          to the South African diamond fields. He returned in 1881 and
          settled at Torquay. In 1885 he paid a visit to Fiji and rejoiced
          in the marvelous change.

    1. Childhood.

          John Calvin the Reformer, b. at Noyon (60 m. n.e. of Paris),
          Picardy, July 10, 1509; d. in Geneva, Switzerland, May 27, 1564,
          was the son of Gérard Cauvin, or Caulvin, of which Calvin is the
          Latinized form, a registrar of the government of Noyon,
          solicitor in the ecclesiastical court, fiscal agent of the
          county, secretary of the bishopric, and attorney of the
          cathedral chapter. Calvin's mother was Jeanne Le Franc of
          Cambrai, noted for personal beauty and great religious fervor
          and strictness. Of the five sons of his parents he was the
          second, and but one of his younger brothers survived childhood.
          His mother died while he was still young and his father married
          a widow, whose name is unknown, who bore him two daughters. His
          father's position and ambition for his sons was such that he
          secured for them the best educational advantages at home,
          association with the children of prominent families, and
          ecclesiastical patronage; so that Calvin on May 19, 1521, when
          only twelve years of age, received the chaplaincy attached to
          the altar of La Gésine in the cathedral of Noyon, which gave him
          a regular income. It was expected that he would become a priest
          and so he was given the tonsure.

    2. Student of Theology.

          In 1523 he was sent to Paris to prepare for the priesthood. He
          attended for a few months the Collège de la Marche, wherein
          Mathurin Cordier grounded him in Latin; next the Collège de
          Montaigu, where he remained till the opening of 1528. The high
          grade of his childish friendships and of those of maturer years
          reveals his own character, and refutes the insinuations his
          detractors have dared to whisper. That he stood well with the
          ecclesiastics in his native city is shown by their giving him on
          Sept. 27, 1527, in addition to the chaplaincy mentioned, the
          (nominal) curacy of Saint Martin de Martheville, eight leagues
          from Noyon, which he exchanged on June 5, 1529, for the curacy
          of Pont l'Évêque, a village 1 m. w. of s. of Noyon, associated
          with his ancestors, who were boatmen on the Oise (not to be
          confounded with Pont l'Évêque, 25 m. e.n.e. of Caen). On Apr.
          30, 1529, he resigned his chaplaincy in favor of his younger
          brother, but resumed it on Feb. 26, 1531, and held it till May
          4, 1534.

    3. Student of Law and the Classics.

          As a student Calvin showed rare ability and was rapidly
          acquiring the priestly training when in 1528 his father, who had
          fallen out with the ecclesiastical authorities in Noyon, ordered
          him to change his studies to law. He meekly obeyed and left
          Paris for Orléans, whose university was then a famous law
          center, as there Pierre Taisan de l'Estoile lectured, and the
          next year went to Bourges, where Andrea Alciati, a rival of
          equal eminence, and more to Calvin's taste, was the great
          attraction. In both universities he came under the influence of
          Melchior Wolmar, a humanist of the front rank and favorable to
          the Reformation. On May 26, 1531, his father died, and Calvin
          left Bourges and returned to Paris, to classical study and the
          study of Hebrew, except that from the summer of 1532 to that of
          1533 he was again a student of law at Orléans and there "annual
          representative" of the dean of the Picard students, another
          indication of his moral standing and popularity with the
          students, for students do not honor of their own accord dubious
          or disagreeable characters.

    4. His First Publication. Conversion.

          In Apr., 1532, he published in Paris at his own expense, and at
          a pecuniary loss, the text of Seneca's De Clementia, with a
          commentary, which showed that he was still a humanist within the
          Roman Church. But the Reformation was making headway in France
          among the humanistic class to which he belonged, and so must
          have often been a topic of his conversation. Step by step he
          approached the position of the Reformers, but slowly, for, as he
          says himself, in the partly autobiographic preface to his
          commentary on the Psalms (and it is about all that is known on
          the subject), he "was too obstinately devoted to the
          superstitions of popery to be easily extricated from so profound
          an abyss of mire." But, some time in 1533, "God by a sudden
          conversion subdued and brought [his] mind to a teachable frame.
          Having thus received some taste and knowledge of true godliness,
          [he] was immediately inflamed with so intense a desire to make
          progress therein, that although [he] did not altogether leave
          off other studies, [he] yet pursued them with less ardor. [He]
          was quite surprised to find that before a year had elapsed, all
          who had any desire after purer doctrine were continually coming
          to [him] to learn, although [he himself] was as yet but a mere
          novice and tyro."

    5. Cop's Inaugural Address.

          Among those with whom he discussed Reformed doctrine was his
          bosom friend Nicolas Cop, and when Cop was elected rector of the
          university of Paris it seemed to them a splendid opportunity to
          commend the Reformation to the cultured and brilliant audience
          which would be gathered in the Church of the Mathurins to hear
          the inaugural address. Accordingly they planned it together and
          on Nov. 1, 1533, Cop delivered it. He announced his theme as
          "Christian Philosophy," and proceeded to speak in a manner which
          greatly amazed his audience. By "Christian Philosophy" he meant
          the Gospel. The phrase and the treatment in the opening part, of
          the address were derived from Erasmus. The burden of it was on
          the relation of Law and Gospel, and here Luther's influence
          appears. The concluding part was more independent, and in it was
          struck that note of certainty as to salvation, which was to be a
          feature of Calvinism.

    6. Years of Wandering. Second Publication.

          Perhaps all would have gone well, for there must have been many
          secret sympathizers with their views in the audience, had Cop
          not criticized the theologians of the Sorbonne as "sophists."
          This infuriated them, and they stirred up the government against
          the audacious speaker, and Cop had to fly. Calvin also fled,
          because his intimacy with Cop was known, although it is not
          certain whether it was even suspected that he had any share in
          the composition of the address as it is now certain that he had.
          Being assured that his fears of personal injury were groundless,
          he ventured to return shortly afterward. But his sympathy with
          the Reformation could not be hidden, and so he did not feel safe
          in the city where so many already had been imprisoned for their
          faith's sake, and in Jan., 1534, he went forth a wanderer,
          usually living under an assumed name. These wanderings lasted
          for two years and a half. As well as they can be made out their
          course was this: he went first to Angoulême, where he studied in
          the excellent library of his friend Louis du Tillet and began
          his "Institutes"; next to Nérac in Apr., 1534, where Marguerite
          d'Angoulême, duchess of Berry and sister of King Francis I. of
          France, held her court; in May he was at Noyon, where he
          resigned his benefices, and where he was for some reason
          imprisoned; in the closing part of the year he was at Paris
          again, and then it was he met Servetus for the first time. Next
          he appeared at Orléans, whence he issued his second publication,
          his Psychopannychia, a refutation of the theory that the soul
          sleeps between death and the Last Judgment. In Dec., 1534, he
          was at Angoulême, and thence with Du Tillet he removed to
          Strasburg to escape threatened persecution.

    7. Publication of his "Institutes."

          In Jan., 1535, he was at Strasburg, and the same month at Basel.
          There he put the finishing touches on his "Institutes of the
          Christian Religion," and issued it Mar., 1536. The persecution
          of the Reformed in France was its immediate occasion. He thus
          speaks of this famous book in the preface to his commentary on
          the Psalms: "My objects were, first, to vindicate my brethren
          whose death was precious in the sight of the Lord; and next
          that, as the same cruelties might very soon after be exercised
          against many unhappy individuals, foreign nations might be
          touched with at least some compassion toward them and solicitude
          about them. When it was then published it was not the copious
          and labored work which it is now, but only a small treatise,
          containing a summary of the principal truths of the Christian
          religion; and it was published with no other design than that
          men might know what was the faith held by those whom I saw
          basely and wickedly defamed by those flagitious and perfidious
          flatterers. That my object was not to acquire fame appeared from
          this, that immediately after I left Basel, and particularly from
          the fact that nobody there knew that I was the author." It was
          prefaced by a letter to King Francis I. of France, who was an
          archpersecutor of Protestants in his kingdom while cultivating
          friendly relations with them outside, which ranks as one of the
          masterpieces in apologetic literature.

    8. First Residence in Geneva and in Strasburg.

          After publishing it he went to Ferrara to stay a while in the
          court of the Duchess Renée, wife of Ercole II. In May 1536 he
          was in Aosta and a little later in Paris once more. There he
          met, his younger brother Antoine and his half-sister Marie, and
          with them left for Strasburg. The war then going on compelled
          him to make a détour and so he arrived in Geneva in the latter
          part of July, 1536, intending only to spend the night there. But
          Farel (see [660]Farel, Guillaume), who was trying with zeal not
          always directed by discretion to keep the Genevans whom he won
          for the Reformation at peace among themselves, learned of his
          presence and seeing in the young scholar, who wanted nothing so
          much as to be allowed to pursue his studies in quiet, a valuable
          ally, besought him to stay with him, and then, as Calvin himself
          says in the preface mentioned above, "finding that he gained
          nothing by entreaties proceeded to utter an imprecation that God
          would curse [his] retirement and the tranquillity of the studies
          which [he] sought if [he] should withdraw and refuse to give
          assistance when the necessity was so urgent." Calvin felt as if
          "God had from heaven laid his mighty hand upon [him] to arrest
          [him]." Unable to resist, he laid aside all his plans and
          stepped to Farel's side. But the city could not brook the
          drastic reforms which the Reformers would institute, and so on
          Easter Monday (Apr. 23), 1538, less than two years from his
          arrival, he and Farel were ordered by the General Assembly to
          leave the city within three days. Calvin went to Basel, and then
          to Strasburg where on Sept. 8, 1538, he became minister to the
          French refugees, in the Church of St. Nicolas aux Oudes. He
          married early in Aug., 1540, Idelette de Bure, widow of Jean
          Stordeur of Liége, an Anabaptist whom Calvin had converted to
          the pedobaptist position. She had had a son and daughter by her
          first husband, but they had died in infancy. To Calvin she bore
          a son on July 28, 1542, but he lived only a few days. She
          herself passed away on Mar. 29, 1549, and Calvin did not marry
          again.

    9. Rising Fame. Recall to Geneva.

          When Calvin went to Strasburg he thought he had done with
          Geneva. He was very poor, and his position was comparatively
          obscure, but his abilities soon brought him into prominence and
          appeals for advice from friends in Geneva kept him in touch with
          that city. He utilized his position to study and also to put
          into practise certain reforms he could not carry out in Geneva.
          And his fame rapidly spread. He was asked to share in the
          cathedral lecture course, next he was sent as delegate of the
          city to the Colloquies of Worms and Regensburg. When on Mar. 18,
          1539, Cardinal Jacopo Sadoleto wrote a letter to the city of
          Geneva which was a plea for it to return to the Roman obedience
          and it was sent to Bern, it was Calvin who was requested by the
          Bern government to answer, and he did in his masterly fashion. A
          change took place in the government in Geneva and the friends of
          Calvin got the upper hand. Then his virtues and extraordinary
          powers were remembered, and on Sept. 21, 1540, the Little
          Council voted to try to induce him to return. More and more the
          impression spread that he was the man to rule the city. There
          was no intention of going back to Rome, but the city was torn by
          faction and contained many unruly elements which needed an iron
          hand to hold in check. On Oct. 19 and 20 the Two Hundred and the
          General Assembly formally invited him to return, but the
          invitation was unwelcome and he would give no decided answer.
          But when in Feb., 1541, the impetuous Farel urged him to go, he
          found him as irresistible as before, and so on Sept. 13, 1541,
          he entered again the city of Geneva and took up the heavy task
          of ordering her affairs according to his high standards. He came
          without illusions, knowing that he was not even the choice of a
          majority, that he had many personal enemies, and would encounter
          many difficulties; but he believed that God had called him and
          would sustain him.

    10. Second Residence in Geneva.

          He received an honorable reception from the government, and was
          given a house to live in, and, for salary, five hundred florins,
          twelve measures of wheat, and two tubs of wine. From that time
          on, Geneva was his home and his parish, his center of activity,
          but by no means his circumference of influence. Under his firm
          rule the city assumed a new aspect. Immorality of every sort was
          sternly suppressed. It was well for the success of this system
          that Geneva was a refuge for the persecuted in every land.
          Hollanders, English, Italians, Spaniards, and more particularly
          Frenchmen, settled in the town, and readily lent their aid in
          maintaining Calvin's peculiar methods. But not refugees alone
          came: his lectures and those of Beza attracted many thousands of
          students, and thus spread their fame far and wide. But incessant
          study, a vast correspondence, "the care of all the churches,"
          his sedentary life--these conspired to make him the victim of
          disease, and at fifty-five years of age he breathed his last. He
          had spent little on himself, but given generously both in money
          and service, so he left behind him only a hundred and seventy
          dollars, but an incalculable fortune in fame and consecrated
          influence; and from him Geneva inherited faith, education,
          government, brave citizens, and pride in an honored name.

    11. Calvin's Fundamental Ideas.

          Calvin based his system upon the Apostles' Creed, and followed
          its lines. Ethics and theology were handled in the closest
          connection. His reformation in theology was preeminently a
          practical affair. Even the doctrine of predestination was
          developed, not as a speculation, but as a matter of practical
          concern. By the extraordinary emphasis put upon it, the Genevans
          were taught to consider it almost the cornerstone of the
          Christian faith. In opposition to the lax views of sin and grace
          which the Roman Church inculcated, he revived the Augustinian
          doctrine in order by it to conquer Rome. In so doing he was one
          with Zwingli, OEcolampadius, Luther, and Melanchthon. But in his
          supralapsarian views he stood alone among the Reformers. His
          views of ecclesiastical authority and discipline are also
          important. He allowed to the Church a greater authority than any
          other Reformer. Here, again, the influence of Augustine is seen.
          He says, "The Church is our mother" ("Institutes," IV. i. 1).
          Outside of the Church there is no salvation. Her ministry is
          divinely instituted, and to it believers are bound to pay
          deference. Her authority is absolute in matters of doctrine;
          but, when civil cases arise, she hands the offenders over to the
          State for punishment. State and Church have, therefore, separate
          and exclusive jurisdiction; yet they exist side by side, and
          cooperate. They mutually support each other. The ideal
          government embraced a democracy, an aristocracy, and a king or
          autocrat. Calvin taught obedience to the powers that be. In this
          scheme he had in mind the Israelites. He aimed at a theocracy.
          He bowed before the majesty of the righteous Judge. His fear of
          God led him to unquestioning submission. In a sense it was his
          very breath; and so in his system justice is more prominent than
          love. God as the ruler, rather than as the lover of all in
          Christ, was the object of his reverence.

    12. His Reforms.

          In accordance with his principles was his work. During his first
          residence in Geneva he showed his determination to separate
          Church and State; and therefore he and his fellow preachers
          protested against the interference of the State in the matter of
          the use of fonts, of unleavened bread in the Lord's Supper, and
          in the celebration of the church-festivals, as these were
          properly within the ecclesiastical province. When, also, he
          refused the Eucharist unto the city, because of its immorality,
          he asserted for the Church freedom from the civil authority.
          This determined stand cost him temporarily his position; but,
          when he resumed his work in Geneva, he and the citizens knew
          that he aimed to rule absolutely. The reforms he instituted are
          famous, and often condemned as infamous. They are, however, not
          only defensible, but commendable, if judged by the standard of
          that age. We can not withhold our admiration of the moral
          courage, the self-forgetfulness, the stern morality, and the
          uncompromising zeal with which Calvin addressed himself unto the
          apparently hopeless task of curbing the passions of the loose
          populace, and gaining the cordial cooperation of the upper
          classes. He succeeded. Geneva came to be regarded as a normal
          school of religious life. Religion was the life of the greater
          part of the inhabitants. With a correct insight into the
          necessities of the case, Calvin declared immediately after his
          victorious reentry that he could not take up work without a
          reorganization of the Church; viz., by the formation of a
          church-court, which should have full authority to maintain
          discipline. On Nov. 20, 1541, at a popular meeting, the scheme
          he drew up was ratified. This provided for a consistory,
          composed of the pastors of the city churches, who were five in
          number, and three assistants, and twelve elders--one of the
          latter to be a syndic and their president--which met every
          Thursday, and put under church-discipline, without respect of
          persons, every species of evil-doers. The rigor and vigor of
          this administration quickly awakened natural indignation, in
          part even among those who on the whole favored Calvin. His life
          was at times in danger. Some showed their terrified contempt for
          him by naming their dogs after him. In a city like Geneva, full
          of refugees of every description, there were many who looked
          upon all restraint as oppression; others who objected to
          Calvin's measures as going too far, or criticized his methods.
          In order still further to increase the authority of the
          church-court, Calvin secured (1555) an important modification of
          the city government, whereby the Conseil Général (the "General
          Council"), the highest law-making body, was only called twice a
          year--in February to elect syndics, and in November to fill some
          minor offices, and fix the price of wine. But nothing might be
          discussed in this meeting which had not been previously
          determined upon in the Council of Two Hundred; nor in the latter
          which the Council of Sixty did not approve of; nor could this
          council take up anything not previously agreed to in the highest
          council, which thus practically governed the State. The General
          Council became in this way a superfluity, without the power of
          initiative. It had, however, accomplished its mission--accepted
          the Reformation.

          Most prominent among the means Calvin used to reform the city
          was preaching. Every other week he preached every day in plain,
          direct, convincing fashion, without eloquence, but still
          irresistibly; and the life that the preacher led constituted his
          strongest claim to attention. The reports of his sermons are
          probably from notes made by his hearers; which was the easier
          done, because, being asthmatic, he spoke very slowly. Every
          Friday the so-called "Congregation" was held, in which questions
          were answered, and debates even carried on. Minors were
          carefully instructed in a catechism originally prepared by
          Calvin in French and Latin, 1545. In 1537 he had issued a
          French, and in 1538 a Latin catechism, which was a mere
          abridgment or syllabus of his "Institutes," and was not in the
          form of question and answer; but the catechism of 1545 was in
          the usual form.

          Calvin has the credit of first introducing congregational
          singing into the worship of the Reformed Church in Geneva. The
          first songs were some of his own metrical renderings of the
          Psalms.

          Like Zwingli and Luther, Calvin had his difficulties with the
          Anabaptists. He met them in public debate Mar. 16-17, 1537, and
          in the opinion of the Council of Two Hundred effectually
          disposed of their arguments. So on Mar. 19 it passed a sentence
          of perpetual banishment against them.

    13. His Opponents.

          But he had personal controversies, the chief of which were--(1)
          first with Pierre Caroli, a French refugee and pastor in
          Lausanne, a religious chameleon, whose latest hue was that of a
          stickler for orthodoxy. Calvin was very indifferent to the
          terminology of theology, so long as the truth was expressed. In
          discussing the nature of the Godhead during his first residence
          in Geneva, he avoided using the words "Trinity" and "Person,"
          although he had no particular objection to them; and so they did
          not occur in the Confession of Faith which he drew up, and to
          which the citizens of Geneva were compelled to assent; nor did
          the Geneva Church subscribe formally to the Athanasian Creed.
          Caroli accused Calvin and his fellow divines of Arianism and
          Sabellianism; and so plausible was the charge, that Calvin was
          greatly troubled. However, in the synod of 1537, held in Bern,
          the Genevan divines fully cleared themselves, and Caroli was
          deposed and banished. (2) Philibert Berthelier, the son of a
          martyr for freedom, was forbidden the communion (1553) by the
          consistory. The council absolved the ban. Calvin from the
          pulpit, two days before the September Communion (one of the four
          yearly occasions), declared that he would die sooner than give
          the Lord's holy things to one under condemnation for despising
          God. Perrin, who was then syndic for the second time, ordered
          Berthelier to stay away from communion, and so ended a dispute
          from which the enemies of Calvin had hoped a great deal. (3)
          [661]Jérôme Hermès Bolsec, whose presumption in denying
          predestination, and abusing the ministers at a "Congregation,"
          drew upon him, not only Calvin's indignant reply at the time,
          but also imprisonment and banishment (1551). (4) [662]Sebastian
          Castellio, a learned but arrogant man, won Calvin's opposition
          because of his denial of the inspiration of the Canticles and of
          the descent of Christ into hell. (5) But by far the most famous
          of all Calvin's opponents was [663]Michael Servetus, who seems
          to have been a rather flippant person. It is said he desired
          Calvin's banishment in order that he might be installed in his
          place. To this end he accused Calvin of perfidious, tyrannical,
          and unchristian conduct. It is no wonder, therefore, that Calvin
          treated him harshly. It is idle to shield Calvin from the charge
          of bringing about Servetus's death, although it is true that the
          mode adopted (burning) did not meet with his approval--he wished
          to have him beheaded; but at the same time it is easy to excuse
          him on the ground of the persecuting spirit of his age. The
          Protestants who had felt the persecution of Rome were ready to
          persecute all who did not follow them. The burning of Servetus
          (Oct. 27, 1553) for the crime of heresy, specifically
          antitrinitarianism, was approved by the Helvetic Church, and,
          what is more remarkable, by the mild Melanchthon; but it failed
          even then to win universal approval, and now it is usually
          considered a sad, ineffaceable blot upon Calvin's character.
          Many who know nothing else of either Calvin or Servetus are very
          indignant over the tragedy, and apparently reject Calvinism
          because of it. We ought rather to mourn than to censure.
          Servetus knew the danger he braved in coming to Geneva. He had
          as early as 1534 been in debate with Calvin, although they did
          not meet personally. On his intimating an intention to visit
          Geneva, Calvin gave him fair warning, that, if he came, he would
          prosecute him to the death. [9] While, therefore, Calvin may be
          held responsible for Servetus's death, he must be cleared of the
          charges of having allured Servetus to Geneva, and of rejoicing
          in his death on personal grounds.

          No good came of the execution, only evil--ridicule from the
          Roman Catholics, and the adverse criticism from many friends. It
          likewise failed to check the antitrinitarian heresy. Calvin
          defended himself, and Beza aided him; but no defense could
          excuse the facts. In 1903 a penitential monument was erected on
          the place of his burning.

    14. His Ecclesiastical Influence.

          By his lectures Calvin attracted students from every quarter. He
          often had as many as a thousand: therefore his influence was
          constantly spreading. As was natural, it was most formative in
          France, whence most of his pupils came, and to whose Protestants
          Calvin was leader and spiritual father. But in other lands he
          exerted his power. In Italy he came to the aid of the troubled
          duchess of Ferrara. To England he sent his commentary on Isaiah,
          with a dedication to the youthful king, Edward VI. To Cranmer he
          wrote letters; and through Knox he molded Scotland. He counseled
          the Moravian Brethren. He helped the Poles in the Trinitarian
          controversy, and likewise the Reformed cause in Hungary. He also
          prepared, in his way, the present interest in foreign missions
          by his unfortunate mission to Brazil in 1555 (See
          [664]Villegagnon, Nicolas Durand de).

          Calvin's relations with Switzerland and Germany were unpleasant.
          He strove most earnestly to unite the different branches of the
          Protestant Church. But unhappily he was suspected by many Swiss
          of Lutheran views on the Lord's Supper--for this was the
          controverted point--and by many Germans of too much
          Zwinglianism; so that he made but an indifferent mediator. He
          had high hopes of the Consensus of Zurich (1549), which
          harmonized the Swiss churches; but the controversy with the
          Lutherans was violently renewed by Hesshus.

    15. His Character.

          The common conception of Calvin is erroneous. He was not the
          stony-hearted tyrant, the relentless persecutor, the gloomy
          theologian, the popular picture represents him to have been.
          Men, by a blessed inconsistency, are often kinder than their
          creeds. So, at all events, was Calvin. To the superficial
          observer he is not attractive; but it is the opinion of every
          one who has studied him that he improves upon acquaintance.
          Granted that he was constitutionally intolerant; that he did
          draft and sternly carry out regulations which were vexatious and
          needlessly severe; that he knew no other standpoint in
          government, morals, or theology than his own--he had qualities
          which entitle him to respect and admiration. He was refined,
          conscientious, pure, faithful, honest, humble, pious. He
          attracted men by the strength of his character, the loftiness of
          his aims, and the directness of his efforts. He had the common
          human affections. He loved his wife, and mourned her death. He
          grieved over his childlessness. He took delight in his friends;
          and they were the noblest in the Protestant Church. Somewhat of
          the forbidding aspect of his life may perhaps be accounted for
          by the unnatural life he was forced to lead. He desired to spend
          his days in study; whereas he was forced to incessant,
          multifarious, and most prominent labor. Experience shows there
          is no harder master than a timid man compelled to lead. Again,
          his ill-health must be taken into account. He was a chronic
          invalid. Such men are not apt to be gentle. The wonder rather is
          that he showed so patient a spirit. The popular verdict has been
          given against him; but vox populi is not always vox dei. What
          Beza, his biographer, wrote is nearer truth: "Having been an
          observer of Calvin's life for sixteen years, I may with perfect
          right testify that we have in this man a most beautiful example
          of a truly Christian life and death, which it is easy to
          calumniate, but difficult to imitate." Ernest Renan finds the
          key to his influence in the fact that he was "the most Christian
          man of his generation" (Studies of Religious History and
          Criticism, New York, 1864 pp. 286 sqq.).

    16. His Personal Appearance.

          Calvin was of middle stature, and, through feeble health, of
          meager and emaciated frame. He had a thin, pale, finely chiseled
          face, a well-formed mouth, a long, pointed beard, black hair, a
          prominent nose, a lofty forehead, and flaming eyes. He was
          modest, plain, and scrupulously neat in dress, orderly and
          methodical in all his habits, temperate, and even abstemious,
          allowing himself scarcely food and sleep enough for vigorous
          work. (The famous portrait by Ary Scheffer is too much
          idealized.)

    17. His Literary Labors.

          Leaving out of view his correspondence, the writings of Calvin
          divide themselves into the theological and the exegetical. In
          regard to the latter it suffices now to say that they have never
          been excelled, if, on the whole, they have beep equaled. He
          possessed all the requisite qualifications for an
          exegete--knowledge of the original tongues, good common sense,
          and abundant piety. His expositions are brief, pithy, and clear.
          His theological writings are remarkable for their early maturity
          and their unvarying consistency. Besides his minor writings, we
          possess that master piece of Protestantism, the "Institutes of
          the Christian Religion." He produced at twenty-six a book in
          which he had nothing essential to change at fifty-five. The
          repeated enlargements were mere developments of its germinal
          ideas. The first edition (Basel, 1536) contained 519 pages,
          measuring 6¼ by 4 inches, was divided into six chapters, and was
          intended merely as a brief apology of the Reformed doctrine: (1)
          Of law, with an exposition of the decalogue; (2) Of faith, with
          an exposition of the Apostles' Creed; (3) Of prayer, with an
          exposition of the Lord's Prayer; (4) Of, the sacraments of
          baptism and the Lord's Supper; (5) Of the other so-called
          sacraments; (6) Of Christian liberty, church government and
          discipline. The French translation made by Calvin himself
          appeared in Basel, 1541. The final form was given to the
          "Institutes" in the Latin edition of Geneva, 1559, when it was
          made into a treatise of four books, divided into a hundred and
          four chapters.

          Bibliography: For a comprehensive bibliography, giving full
          details as to the successive publications of Calvin, their later
          editions, also of books written on Calvin's life and theology,
          consult A. Erichson, Bibliographia Calviniana. Berlin, 1900.

          The complete edition of Calvin's Works, superseding previous
          editions, is Joannis Calvini Opera quæ supersunt omnia, vol.
          i.-lix., ed. J. W. Baum, E. Cunitz, E. Reuss, P. Lobstein, and
          A. Ericheon. The last was assisted by W. Baldensperger and L.
          Horst. The edition was begun by the three first-named, Berlin,
          1860, and finished by Erichson in 1900. There is an excellent
          translation of the commentaries, his Institutes, and his Tracts
          relating to the Reformation, by H. Beveridge, published by the
          Calvin Translation Society, 52 vols., Edinburgh, 1844-55. The
          fullest collection of Calvin's letters is in the Berlin edition.
          In 1854 in Paris Jules Bonnet published a collection, and this
          has been translated, volumes i., ii., by D. Constable,
          Edinburgh, 1855-57; volumes iii., iv., by M. R. Gilchrist,
          Philadelphia, 1858. The four volumes are now published by the
          Presbyterian Board of Publication, Philadelphia. The letters to
          correspondents living in French-speaking lands are given in
          their original Latin or French with careful and scholarly
          annotations by A. L. Herminjard (d. 1900) in the nine volumes of
          his Correspondance des réformateurs dans les pays de langue
          francaise, 1512-44, Geneva, 1866-97. The first letter of
          Calvin's is no. 310 in vol. ii., 2d ed., 1878.

          For the life of Calvin the original source is the sketch by his
          friend and coadjutor Theodore Beza, Geneva, 1564, 2d ed.,
          Lausanne, 1575; edited by Neander, Berlin, 1841, Eng. transl.,
          by H. Beveridge, in Tracts relating to the Reformation, in the
          Calvin Society translation, vol. i., Edinburgh, 1844. Much
          information comes out incidentally in his correspondence.

          Modern lives of Calvin, derived from independent study of the
          works and other sources, which can be commended are those by T.

    1. Meaning and Uses of the Term.

          Calvinism is an ambiguous term in so far as it is currently
          employed in two or three senses, closely related indeed, and
          passing insensibly into one another, but of varying latitudes of
          connotation. Sometimes it designates merely the individual
          teaching of John Calvin. Sometimes it designates, more broadly,
          the doctrinal system confessed by that body of Protestant
          Churches known historically, in distinction from the Lutheran
          Churches, as "the Reformed Churches" (see [665]Protestantism);
          but also quite commonly called "the Calvinistic Churches"
          because the greatest scientific exposition of their faith in the
          Reformation age, and perhaps the most influential of any age,
          was given by John Calvin. Sometimes it designates, more broadly
          still, the entire body of conceptions, theological, ethical,
          philosophical, social, political, which, under the influence of
          the master mind of John Calvin, raised itself to dominance in
          the Protestant lands of the post-Reformation age, and has left a
          permanent mark not only upon the thought of mankind, but upon
          the life-history of men, the social order of civilized peoples,
          and even the political organization of States. In the present
          article, the term will be taken, for obvious reasons, in the
          second of these tenses. Fortunately this is also its central
          sense; and there is little danger that its other connotations
          will fall out of mind while attention is concentrated upon this.

          On the one hand, John Calvin, though always looked upon by the
          Reformed Churches as an exponent rather than as the creator of
          their doctrinal system, has nevertheless been both reverenced as
          one of their founders, and deferred to as that particular one of
          their founders to whose formative hand and systematizing talent
          their doctrinal system has perhaps owed most. In any exposition
          of the Reformed theology, therefore, the teaching of John Calvin
          must always take a high, and, indeed, determinative place. On
          the other hand, although Calvinism has dug a channel through
          which not merely flows a stream of theological thought, but also
          surges great wave of human life--filling the heart with fresh
          ideals and conceptions which have revolutionized the conditions
          of existence--yet its fountain-head lies in its theological
          system; or rather, to be perfectly exact, one step behind even
          that, in its religious consciousness. For the roots of Calvinism
          are planted in a specific religious attitude, out of which is
          unfolded first a particular theology, from which springs on the
          one hand a special church organization, and on the other a
          social order, involving a given political arrangement. The whole
          outworking of Calvinism in life is thus but the efflorescence of
          its fundamental religious consciousness, which finds its
          scientific statement in its theological system.

    2. Fundamental Principle.

          The exact formulation of the fundamental principle of Calvinism
          has indeed taxed the acumen of a long series of thinkers for the
          last hundred years (e.g., Ullmann, Semiech, Hagenbach, Ebrard,
          Herzog, Schweizer, Baur, Schneckenburger, Guder, Schenkel,
          Schöberlein, Stahl, Hundeshagen; for a discussion of the several
          views cf. H. Voigt, Fundamentaldogmatik, Gotha, 1874, pp.
          397-480; W. Hastie, The Theology of the Reformed Church in its
          Fundamental Principles, Edinburgh, 1904, pp. 129-177). Perhaps
          the simplest statement of it is the best: that it lies in a
          profound apprehension of God in his majesty, with the inevitably
          accompanying poignant realization of the exact nature of the
          relation sustained to him by the creature as such, and
          particularly by the sinful creature. He who believes in God
          without reserve, and is determined that God shall be God to him
          in all his thinking, feeling, willing--in the entire compass of
          his life-activities, intellectual, moral, spiritual, throughout
          all his individual, social, religious relations--is, by the
          force of that strictest of all logic which presides over the
          outworking of principles into thought and life, by the very
          necessity of the case, a Calvinist. In Calvinism, then,
          objectively speaking, theism comes to its rights; subjectively
          speaking, the religious relation attains its purity;
          soteriologically speaking, evangelical religion finds at length
          its full expression and its secure stability. Theism comes to
          its rights only in a teleological conception of the universe,
          which perceives in the entire course of events the orderly
          outworking of the plan of God, who is the author, preserver, and
          governor of all things, whose will is consequently the ultimate
          cause of all. The religious relation attains its purity only
          when an attitude of absolute dependence on God is not merely
          temporarily assumed in the act, say, of prayer, but is sustained
          through all the activities of life, intellectual, emotional,
          executive. And evangelical religion reaches stability only when
          the sinful soul rests in humble, self-emptying trust purely on
          the God of grace as the immediate and sole source of all the
          efficiency which enters into its salvation. And these things are
          the formative principles of Calvinism.

    3. Relation to Other Systems.

          The difference between Calvinism and other forms of theistic
          thought, religious experience, evangelical theology is a
          difference not of kind but of degree. Calvinism is not a
          specific variety of theism, religion, evangelicalism, set over
          against other specific varieties, which along with it constitute
          these several genera, and which possess equal rights of
          existence with it and make similar claims to perfection, each
          after its own kind. It differs from them not as one species
          differs from other species; but as a perfectly developed
          representative differs from an imperfectly developed
          representative of the same species. There are not many kinds of
          theism, religion, evangelicalism, among which men are at liberty
          to choose to suit at will their individual taste or meet their
          special need, all of which may be presumed to serve each its own
          specific uses equally worthily. There is but one kind of theism,
          religion, evangelicalism; and the several constructions laying
          claim to these names differ from each other not as correlative
          species of a broader class, but as more or less perfect, or more
          or less defective, exemplifications of a single species.
          Calvinism conceives of itself as simply the more pure theism,
          religion, evangelicalism, superseding as such the less pure. It
          has no difficulty, therefore, in recognizing the theistic
          character of all truly theistic thought, the religious note in
          all actual religious activity, the evangelical quality of all
          really evangelical faith. It refuses to be set antagonistically
          over against any of these things, wherever or in whatever degree
          of imperfection they may be manifested; it claims them in every
          instance of their emergence as its own, and essays only to point
          out the way in which they may be given their just place in
          thought and life. Whoever believes in God; whoever recognizes in
          the recesses of his soul his utter dependence on God; whoever in
          all his thought of salvation hears in his heart of hearts the
          echo of the soli Deo gloria of the evangelical profession--by
          whatever name he may call himself, or by whatever intellectual
          puzzles his logical understanding may be confused--Calvinism
          recognizes as implicitly a Calvinist, and as only requiring to
          permit these fundamental principles--which underlie and give its
          body to all true religion--to work themselves freely and fully
          out in thought and feeling and action, to become explicitly a
          Calvinist.

    4. Calvinism and Lutheranism.

          It is unfortunate that a great body of the scientific discussion
          which, since Max Göbel (Die religiöse Eigenthümlichkeit der
          lutherischen und reformirten Kirchen, Bonn, 1837) first clearly
          posited the problem, has been carried on somewhat vigorously
          with a view to determining the fundamental principle of
          Calvinism, has sought particularly to bring out its contrast
          with some other theological tendency, commonly with the sister
          Protestant tendency of Lutheranism. Undoubtedly somewhat
          different spirits inform Calvinism and Lutheranism. And
          undoubtedly the distinguishing spirit of Calvinism is rooted not
          in some extraneous circumstance of its antecedents or
          origin--as, for example, Zwingli's tendency to intellectualism,
          or the superior humanistic culture and predilections of Zwingli
          and Calvin, or the democratic instincts of the Swiss, or the
          radical rationalism of the Reformed leaders as distinguished
          from the merely modified traditionalism of the Lutherans--but in
          its formative principle. But it is misleading to find the
          formative principle of either type of Protestantism in its
          difference from the other: they have infinitely more in common
          than in distinction. And certainly nothing could be more
          misleading than to represent them (as is often done) as owing
          their differences to their more pure embodiment respectively of
          the principle of predestination and that of justification by
          faith. The doctrine of predestination is not the formative
          principle of Calvinism, the root from which it springs. It is
          one of its logical consequences, one of the branches which it
          has inevitably thrown out. It has been firmly embraced and
          consistently proclaimed by Calvinists because it is an implicate
          of theism, is directly given in the religious consciousness, and
          is an absolutely essential element in evangelical religion,
          without which its central truth of complete dependence upon the
          free mercy of a saving God can not be maintained. And so little
          is it a peculiarity of the Reformed theology, that it underlay
          and gave its form and power to the whole Reformation movement;
          which was, as from the spiritual point of view, a great revival
          of religion, so, from the doctrinal point of view, a great
          revival of Augustinianism There was accordingly no difference
          among the Reformers on this point: Luther and Melanchthon and
          the compromising Butzer were no less jealous for absolute
          predestination than Zwingli and Calvin. Even Zwingli could not
          surpass Luther in sharp and unqualified assertion of it: and it
          was not Calvin but Melanchthon who gave it a formal place in his
          primary scientific statement of the elements of the Protestant
          faith (cf. Schaff, Creeds, i. 451; E. F. Karl Müller, Symbolik,
          Leipsic, 1896, p. 75; C. J. Niemijer, De Strijd over de Leer der
          Predestinatie in de IX. Eeuw, Groningen, 1889, p. 21; H. Voigt,
          Fundamentaldogmatik, Gotha, 1874, pp, 469-470). Just as little
          can the doctrine of justification by faith be represented as
          specifically Lutheran. Not merely has it from the beginning been
          a substantial element in the Reformed faith, but it is only
          among the Reformed that it has retained or can retain its
          purity, free from the tendency to become a doctrine of
          justification on account of faith (cf. E. Böhl, Von der
          Rechtfertigung durch den Glauben, Amsterdam, 1890). Here, too,
          the difference between the two types of Protestantism is one of
          degree, not of kind (cf. C. P. Krauth, The Conservative
          Reformation, Philadelphia, 1872). Lutheranism, the product of a
          poignant sense of sin, born from the throes of a guilt-burdened
          soul which can not be stilled until it finds peace in God's
          decree of justification, is apt to rest in this peace; while
          Calvinism, the product of an overwhelming vision of God, born
          from the reflection in the heart of man of the majesty of a God
          who will not give his glory to another, can not pause until it
          places the scheme of salvation itself in relation to a complete
          world-view, in which it becomes subsidiary to the glory of the
          Lord God Almighty. Calvinism asks with Lutheranism, indeed, that
          most poignant of all questions, What shall I do to be saved? and
          answers it as Lutheranism answers it. But the great question
          which presses upon it is, How shall God be glorified? It is the
          contemplation of God and zeal for his honor which in it draws
          out the emotions and absorbs endeavor; and the end of human as
          of all other existence, of salvation as of all other attainment,
          is to it the glory of the Lord of all. Full justice is done in
          it to the scheme of redemption and the experience of salvation,
          because full justice is done in it to religion itself which
          underlies these elements of it. It begins, it centers, it ends
          with the vision of God in his glory: and it sets itself before
          all things to render to God his rights in every sphere of
          life-activity.

    5. Soteriology of Calvinism.

          One of the consequences flowing from this fundamental attitude
          of Calvinistic feeling and thought is the high supernaturalism
          which informs alike its religious consciousness and its
          doctrinal construction. Calvinism would not be badly defined,
          indeed, as the tendency which is determined to do justice to the
          immediately supernatural, as in the first, so also in the second
          creation. The strength and purity of its belief in the
          supernatural Fact (which is God) saves it from all embarrassment
          in the face of the supernatural act (which is miracle). In
          everything which enters into the process of redemption it is
          impelled by the force of its first principle to place the
          initiative in God. A super natural revelation, in which God
          makes known to man his will and his purposes of grace; a
          supernatural record of this revelation in a supernaturally given
          book, in which God gives his revelation permanency and
          extension--such things are to the Calvinist almost matters of
          course. And, above all, he can but insist with the utmost
          strenuousness on the immediate supernaturalness of the actual
          work of redemption itself, and that no less in its application
          than in its impetration. Thus it comes about that the doctrine
          of monergistic regeneration--or as it was phrased by the older
          theologians, of "irresistible grace" or "effectual calling"--is
          the hinge of the Calvinistic soteriology, and lies much more
          deeply embedded in the system than the doctrine of
          predestination itself which is popularly looked upon as its
          hall-mark. Indeed, the soteriological significance of
          predestination to the Calvinist consists in the safeguard it
          affords to monergistic regeneration--to purely supernatural
          salvation. What lies at the heart of his soteriology is the
          absolute exclusion of the creaturely element in the initiation
          of the saving process, that so the pure grace of God may be
          magnified. Only so could he express his sense of men's complete
          dependence as sinners on the free mercy of a saving God; or
          extrude the evil leaven of [666]Synergism by which, as he
          clearly sees, God is robbed of his glory and man is encouraged
          to think that he owes to some power, some act of choice, some
          initiative of his own, his participation in that salvation which
          is in reality all of grace. There is accordingly nothing against
          which Calvinism sets its face with more firmness than every form
          and degree of autosoterism. Above everything else, it is
          determined that God, in his Son Jesus Christ, acting through the
          Holy Spirit whom he has sent, shall be recognized as our
          veritable Savior. To it sinful man stands in need not of
          inducements or assistance to save himself, but of actual saving;
          and Jesus Christ has come not to advise, or urge, or induce, or
          aid him to save himself, but to save him. This is the root of
          Calvinistic soteriology; and it is because this deep sense of
          human helplessness and this profound consciousness of
          indebtedness for all that enters into salvation to the free
          grace of God is the root of its soteriology that to it the
          doctrine of election becomes the cor cordis of the Gospel. He
          who knows that it is God who has chosen him and not he who has
          chosen God, and that he owes his entire salvation in all its
          processes and in every one of its stages to this choice of God,
          would be an ingrate indeed if he gave not the glory of his
          salvation solely to the inexplicable elective love of God.

    6. Consistent Development of Calvinism.

          Historically the Reformed theology finds its origin in the
          reforming movement begun in Switzerland under the leadership of
          Zwingli (1516). Its fundamental principles are already present
          in Zwingli's teaching, though it was not until Calvin's profound
          and penetrating genius was called to their exposition that they
          took their ultimate form or received systematic development.
          From Switzerland Calvinism spread outward to France, and along
          the Rhine through Germany to Holland, eastward to Bohemia and
          Hungary, and westward, across the Channel, to Great Britain. In
          this broad expansion through so many lands its voice was raised
          in a multitude of confessions; and in the course of the four
          hundred years which have elapsed since its first formulation, it
          has been expounded in a vast body of dogmatic treatises. Its
          development has naturally been much richer and far more
          many-sided than that of the sister system of Lutheranism in its
          more confined and homogeneous environment; and yet it has
          retained its distinctive character and preserved its fundamental
          features with marvelous consistency throughout its entire
          history. It may be possible to distinguish among the Reformed
          confessions, between those which bear more and those which bear
          less strongly the stamp of Calvin's personal influence; and they
          part into two broad classes, according as they were composed
          before or after the Arminian defection (c. 1618) demanded
          sharper definitions on the points of controversy raised by that
          movement (see [667]Arminius, Jacobus, and Arminianism;
          [668]Remonstrants). A few of them written on German soil also
          bear traces of the influence of Lutheran conceptions. And, of
          course, no more among the Reformed than elsewhere have all the
          professed expounders of the system of doctrine been true to the
          faith they professed to expound. Nevertheless, it is precisely
          the same system of truth which is embodied in all the great
          historic Reformed confessions; it matters not whether the
          document emanates from Zurich or Bern or Basel or Geneva,
          whether it sums up the Swiss development as in the Second
          Helvetic Confession, or publishes the faith of the National
          Reformed Churches of France, or Scotland, or Holland, or the
          Palatinate, or Hungary, Poland, Bohemia, or England; or
          republishes the established Reformed doctrine in opposition to
          new contradictions, as in the Canons of Dort (in which the
          entire Reformed world concurred), or the Westminster Confession
          (to which the whole of Puritan Britain gave its assent), or the
          Swiss Form of Consent (which represents the mature judgment of
          Switzerland upon the recently proposed novelties of doctrine).
          And despite the inevitable variety of individual points of view,
          as well as the unavoidable differences in ability, learning,
          grasp, in the multitude of writers who have sought to expound
          the Reformed faith through these four centuries--and the grave
          departures from that faith made here and there among them--the
          great stream of Reformed dogmatics has flowed essentially
          unsullied, straight from its origin in Zwingli and Calvin to its
          debouchure, say, in Chalmers and Cunningham and Crawford, in
          Hodge and Thornwell and Shedd.

    7. Varieties of Calvinism.

          It is true an attempt has been made to distinguish two types of
          Reformed teaching from the beginning; a more radical type
          developed under the influence of the peculiar teachings of
          Calvin, and a (so-called) more moderate type, chiefly
          propagating itself in Germany, which exhibits rather the
          influence, as was at first said (Hofstede de Groot, Ebrard,
          Heppe), of Melanchthon, or, in its more recent statement
          (Gooszen), of Bullinger. In all that concerns the essence of
          Calvinism, however, there was no difference between Bullinger
          and Calvin, German and Swiss: the Heidelberg Catechism is no
          doubt a catechism and not a confession, but in its
          presuppositions and inculcations it is as purely Calvinistic as
          the Genevan Catechism or the catechisms of the Westminster
          Assembly. Nor was the substance of doctrine touched by the
          peculiarities of method which marked such schools as the
          so-called Scholastics (showing themselves already in Zanchius,
          d. 1590, and culminating in theologians like Alsted, d. 1638,
          and Voetius, d. 1676); or by the special modes of statement
          which were developed by such schools as the so-called
          Federalists (e.g., Cocceius, d. 1669, Burman, d. 1679 Wittsius,
          d. 1708; cf. Diestel, Studien zur Federaltheologie, in
          Jahrbücher fur deutsche Theologie, 1862, ii.; G. Vos, De
          Verbondsleer in de Gereformeerde Theologie, Grand Rapids, 1891;
          W. Hastie, The Theology of the Reformed Church, Edinburgh, 1904,
          pp. 189-210). The first serious defection from the fundamental
          conceptions of the Reformed system came with the rise of
          Arminianism in the early years of the seventeenth century
          (Arminius, Uytenbogaert, Episcopius, Limborch, Curcellæus); and
          the Arminian party was quickly sloughed off under the
          condemnation of the whole Reformed world. The five points of its
          "Remonstrance" against the Calvinistic system (see
          [669]Remonstrants) were met by the reassertion of the
          fundamental doctrines of absolute predestination, particular
          redemption, total depravity, irresistible grace, and the
          perseverance of the saints (Canons of the Synod of Dort). The
          first important modification of the Calvinistic system which has
          retained a position within its limits was made in the middle of
          the seventeenth century by the professors of the French school
          at Saumur, and is hence called Salmurianism; otherwise
          Amyraldism, or hypothetical universalism (Cameron, d. 1625,
          Amyraut, d. 1664, Placæus, d. 1655, Testardus, d. c. 1650; see
          [670]Amyraut, Moïse). This modification also received the
          condemnation of the contemporary Reformed world, which
          reasserted with emphasis the importance of the doctrine that
          Christ actually saves by his spirit all for whom he offers the
          sacrifice of his blood (e.g., Westminster Confession, Swiss Form
          of Consent).

    8. Supralapsarianism and Infralapsarianism.

          If "varieties of Calvinism" are to be spoken of with reference
          to anything more than details, of importance in themselves no
          doubt, but of little significance for the systematic development
          of the type of doctrine, there seem not more than three which
          require mention: supralapsarianism, infralapsarianism, and what
          may perhaps be called in this reference, Postredemptionism; all
          of which (as indeed their very names import) take their start
          from a fundamental agreement in the principles which govern the
          system. The difference between these various tendencies of
          thought within the limits of the system turns on the place given
          by each to the decree of election, in the logical ordering of
          the "decrees of God." The Supralapsasians suppose that election
          underlies the decree of the fall itself; and conceive the decree
          of the fall as a means for carrying out the decree of election.
          The Infralapsarians, on the other hand, consider that election
          presupposes the decree of the fall, and hold, therefore, that in
          electing some to life God has mankind as a massa perditionis in
          mind. The extent of the difference between these parties is
          often, indeed usually, grossly exaggerated: and even historians
          of repute are found representing infralapsarianism as involving,
          or at least permitting, denial that the fall has a place in the
          decree of God at all: as if election could be postposited in the
          ordo decretorum to the decree of the fall, while it was doubted
          whether there were any decree of the fall; or as if indeed God
          could be held to conceive men, in his electing decree, as
          fallen, without by that very act fixing the presupposed fall in
          his eternal decree. In point of fact there is and can be no
          difference among Calvinists as to the inclusion of the fall in
          the decree of God: to doubt this inclusion is to place oneself
          at once at variance with the fundamental Calvinistic principle
          which conceives all that comes to pass teleologically and
          ascribes everything that actually occurs ultimately to the will
          of God.

    9. Postredemptionism.

          Accordingly even the Postredemptionists (that is to say the
          Salmurians or Amyraldians) find no difficulty at this point.
          Their peculiarity consists in insisting that election succeeds,
          in the order of thought, not merely the decree of the fall but
          that of redemption as well, taking the term redemption here in
          the narrower sense of the impetration of redemption by Christ.
          They thus suppose that in his electing decree God conceived man
          not merely as fallen but as already redeemed. This involves a
          modified doctrine of the atonement from which the party has
          received the name of Hypothetical Universalism, holding as it
          does that Christ died to make satisfaction for the sins of all
          men without exception if--if, that is, they believe: but that,
          foreseeing that none would believe, God elected some to be
          granted faith through the effectual operation of the Holy
          Spirit. The indifferent standing of the Postredemptionists in
          historical Calvinism is indicated by the treatment accorded it
          in the historical confessions. It alone of the "varieties of
          Calvinism" here mentioned has been made the object of formal
          confessional condemnation; and it received condemnation in every
          important Reformed confession written after its development.
          There are, it is true, no supralapsarian confessions: many,
          however, leave the questions which divide supralapsarian and
          infralapsarian wholly to one side and thus avoid pronouncing for
          either; and none is polemically directed against
          supralapsarianism. On the other hand, not only does no
          confession close the door to infralapsarianism, but a
          considerable number explicitly teach infralapsarianism which
          thus emerges as the typical form of Calvinism. That, despite its
          confessional condemnation, Postredemptionism has remained a
          recognized form of Calvinism and has worked out a history for
          itself in the Calvinistic Churches (especially in America) may
          be taken as evidence that its advocates, while departing, in
          some important particulars, from typical Calvinism, have
          nevertheless remained, in the main, true to the fundamental
          postulates of the system. There is another variety of
          Postredemptionism, however, of which this can scarcely be said.
          This variety, which became dominant among the New England
          Congregationalist Churches about the second third of the
          nineteenth century (e.g., N W. Taylor, d. 1858; C. G. Finney, d.
          1875; E. A. Park, d. 1900; see [671]New England Theology),
          attempted, much after the manner of the "Congruists" of the
          Church of Rome, to unite a Pelagian doctrine of the will with
          the Calvinistic doctrine of absolute predestination. The result
          was, of course, to destroy the Calvinistic doctrine of
          "irresistible grace," and as the Calvinistic doctrine of the
          "satisfaction of Christ" was also set aside in favor of the
          Grotian or governmental theory of atonement, little was left of
          Calvinism except the bare doctrine of predestination. Perhaps it
          is not strange, therefore, that this "improved Calvinism" has
          crumbled away and given place to newer and explicitly
          anti-Calvinistic constructions of doctrine (cf. Williston
          Walker, in AJT, Apr., 1906, pp. 204 sqq. ).

    10. Present Fortunes of Calvinism.

          It must be confessed that the fortunes of Calvinism in general
          are not at present at their flood. In America, to be sure, the
          controversies of the earlier half of the nineteenth century
          compacted a body of Calvinistic thought which gives way but
          slowly: and the influence of the great theologians who adorned
          the churches during that period is still felt (especially
          Charles Hodge, 1797-1878, Robert J. Breckinridge,1800-71, James
          H. Thornwell, 1812-62, Henry B. Smith, 1815-77, W. G. T. Shedd,
          1820-94, Robert L. Dabney, 1820-98, Archibald Alexander Hodge,
          1823-86). And in Holland recent years have seen a notable
          revival of the Reformed consciousness, especially among the
          adherents of the Free Churches, which has been felt as widely as
          Dutch influence extends, and which is at present represented in
          Abraham Kuyper and Herman Bavinck, by a theologian of genius and
          a theologian of erudition worthy of the best Reformed
          traditions. But it is probable that few "Calvinists without
          reserve" exist at the moment in French-speaking lands: and those
          who exist in lands of German speech and Eastern Europe appear to
          owe their inspiration directly to the teaching of Kohlbrügge.
          Even in Scotland there has been a remarkable decline in
          strictness of construction ever since the days of William
          Cunningham and Thomas J. Crawford (cf. W. Hastie, The Theology
          of the Reformed Church, Edinburgh, 1904, p. 228). Nevertheless,
          it may be contended that the future, as the past, of
          Christianity itself is bound up with the fortunes of Calvinism.
          The system of doctrine founded on the idea of God which has been
          explicated by Calvinism, strikingly remarks W. Hastie (Theology
          as a Science, Glasgow, 1899, pp. 97-98), "is the only system in
          which the whole order of the world is brought into a rational
          unity with the doctrine of grace. . . . It is only with such a
          universal conception of God, established in a living way, that
          we can face, with hope of complete conquest, all the spiritual
          dangers and terrors of our time. . . . But it is deep enough and
          large enough and divine enough, rightly understood, to confront
          them and do battle with them all in vindication of the Creator,
          Preserver, and Governor of the world, and of the Justice, and
          Love of the Divine Personality." See [672]Five Points of
          Calvinism.

   Camaldolites (Camaldolensians, Camaldolese, Camaldules, Camaldulians)
          CAMALDOLITES (called also Camaldolensians, Camaldolese,
          Camaldules, Camaldulians, from the monastery at Camaldoli near
          Arezzo): A religious order springing from the movement for
          monastic reform which also gave rise to the congregations of
          Cluny and Lorraine, with which it is allied in some respects,
          though it differs from them in others. The Italian movement is
          wholly independent of the French, and began later--not before
          the close of the tenth century, after the Cluniac monks had
          already reformed numerous monasteries in upper and central
          Italy. It was more enthusiastic than the French, and had for its
          object not so much the strict enforcement of the Benedictine
          rule as the commendation, in opposition to the moral corruption
          which was even deeper in the south than in the north, of the
          severest form of the ascetic life, that of hermits. This recalls
          the Greek monastic originators; and the fact is easily
          explicable by the strong influence of Greek traditions in Italy,
          especially in the south.

    St. Romuald.

          St. Romuald is the most prominent, but by no means the only,
          representative of this idea. Before or with him were working for
          the same end the Armenian hermit Simeon, St. Dominic of Foligno,
          the founder of Fonte Avellana, and the Greek Nilos of Rossano.
          Romuald was born at Ravenna, of the ducal family there, about
          950. He was startled out of a worldly life when his father
          Sergius killed a kinsman in a duel arising out of a dispute over
          a piece of property, and retired to the monastery of S.
          Apollinare in Classe near Ravenna to do penance forty days on
          his father's behalf. His ascetic zeal was not satisfied here,
          although the monastery had been reformed not long before by
          Majolus of Cluny. He began to live a hermit's life near Venice,
          continued it in Catalonia, and then returned to the neighborhood
          of Ravenna. Wherever he went, a group of disciples formed around
          him; but as soon as they were sufficiently numerous in any one
          place, he gave them into the charge of a superior and left them.
          Most of these colonies were in central Italy; the three most
          important were Val di Castro, Monte Sitrio in Umbria, and
          Camaldoli, where he established a monastery in 1012. His
          organization shows a combination of the Western cenobite system
          with the Eastern anchorite life. The brothers lived in single
          cells, with an oratory in the midst. The whole Psalter was
          recited every day; the only written memorial left by Romuald was
          an exposition of the Psalms, which, however, is taken almost
          word for word from that of Cassiodorus. Meals were taken in
          common, but they were exceedingly scanty; the brothers went
          barefoot and wore their hair and beards long; the rule of
          silence was strictly observed. They busied themselves with
          agriculture and various handicrafts, those near the sea
          especially with the making of baskets and nets. We meet for the
          first time in these hermit colonies with famuli, the later lay
          brothers, who relieved the monks of the more burdensome
          household duties The rule of fasting and silence was not so
          strict for them, but apparently, as at Fonte Avellana, they had
          to take lifelong monastic vows. This institution was borrowed by
          Gualberto, a disciple of Romuald's, for his order of Vallombrosa
          and further developed by him (see [673]Gualberto, Giovanni).
          Romuald's activity was not confined to the founding of these
          communities. He made a deep impression upon the most varied
          classes, and exercised a great influence over the emperor Otto
          III., who, it is asserted not improbably, promised him to
          exchange the crown for the cowl after he had conquered Rome.
          Though Romuald disclaimed any intention of taking part in
          ecclesiastical politics, he raised his voice loudly in Italy
          against simony and the marriage of the clergy. His zeal called
          him to the mission-field; disciples of his penetrated into
          Russia and Poland, there to meet death for their faith, and the
          desire of the martyr's crown finally took the aged hermit
          himself to Hungary. Ill health hindered his work there, and he
          returned to die in 1027.

    The Camaldolese.

          His zeal for a reform of monasticism remained active in his
          followers. They did not, however, emphasize the hermit ideal to
          the same extent, and the Italian movement gradually approximated
          to that of Cluny. Romuald's spirit was best followed in the
          community of Camaldoli, which received papal confirmation from
          Alexander II. in 1072. Its rule was first written in 1080 by the
          fourth prior, Rudolph, who modified in some respects the extreme
          strictness of Romuald's prescriptions, and also founded (1086)
          the first convent of nuns under this rule, San Pietro di Luco at
          Mogello. Camaldoli received many rich gifts, and the
          congregation spread throughout Italy, without, however,
          producing any very notable men except the famous jurist
          [674]Gratian. The transition from the hermit to the community
          life became more marked, in spite of the efforts of [675]Ambrose
          the Camaldolite of Portico, "major" or head of the congregation
          in 1431, supported by Pope Eugenius IV., to restore the old
          ideals. In 1476 the community of St. Michael at Murano near
          Venice renounced the obedience of Camaldoli, and formed a group
          of distinctly cenobitic Camaldolese houses, confirmed as a
          congregation by Innocent VIII. In 1513 Leo X. reunited all the
          Camaldolese monks under the headship of Camaldoli, providing
          that the major should hold office for but three years, and be
          chosen alternately from the hermits and the cenobites. But in
          1520 he allowed Paolo Giustiniani to draw up new statutes and to
          form the new communities of hermits which he was to found into
          an independent congregation of St. Romuald. This new
          congregation, which took its name from Monte Corona near
          Perugia, had a very strict rule; it spread through Germany,
          Austria, and Poland. A fourth congregation, that of Turin, was
          founded in 1601 by Alessandro di Leva (d. 1612), to take in the
          hermits of Piedmont. A breach of this became practically a
          separate congregation on account of the political views of
          Richelieu, who was unwilling that the French hermitages should
          be subject to Italian superiors. By a brief of Urban VIII.
          (1635), its head was always to be a Frenchman, and directly
          subject to the pope. From 1642 Gros-Bois near Paris was its
          mother house. All the French communities perished at the
          Revolution. The congregation of Camaldoli has now six houses,
          including Camaldoli itself and one famous for its picturesque
          site high above Naples. The principal house of the Murano
          congregation is San Gregorio in Rome, from which came the only
          Camaldolese monk who has occupied the papal throne, Gregory XVI.
          (1831-46). Outside of Italy there is only the community of
          Bielany in the diocese of Cracow, belonging to the congregation
          of Monte Corona. The total membership of the order is not more
          than 200. Convents of nuns exist only in Rome and Florence.

   Cambrai
          CAMBRAI, c??n´´brê´: An ancient archbishopric in the north of
          France. As early as the beginning of the fifth century, when the
          Franks invaded Gaul, Cameracum was an important town, as is
          evident from Gregory of Tours (Hist. Francorum, ii. 9). On the
          death of Lothair II. it passed to Charles the Bald. Later its
          possession was contested by the emperors, the counts of
          Flanders, and the kings of France. It was taken from the French
          by the Spaniards in 1595, but has been a part of France since
          1677.

          The traditional list of its bishops begins with Diogenes, said
          to have been sent by Pope Siricius (384-398); but this is
          untrustworthy. Firm historical ground is reached first with St.
          Vedast, who was consecrated bishop of St. Remigius, bishop of
          Reims, and presided over the churches of Arras and Cambrai until
          his death in 540. The see was transferred to Cambrai under
          Vedulf (545-c. 580), but the two remained united until Arras
          received a bishop of its own in 1093. Among later incumbents of
          the see of Cambrai may be mentioned the holy Odo (1105-06), the
          unfortunate Cardinal Robert of Geneva (bishop from 1368,
          antipope 1378-94), the renowned Pierre d'Ailly (1397-c. 1425);
          and, after its elevation in 1559 to the rank of an
          archbishopric, Fénelon (1695-1715), and Cardinal Dubois
          (1720-23). The Revolution deprived Cambrai of its metropolitan
          dignity, subjecting it as a simple bishopric to the see of
          Paris, but in 1842 it was once more made au archbishopric, with
          Arras as suffragan. Its magnificent ancient cathedral was
          destroyed in the Revolution, with the exception of the tower,
          which fell in a great storm in 1809. The present cathedral was
          formerly the Benedictine church of the Holy Sepulcher.

   Cambridge Platonists
          CAMBRIDGE PLATONISTS: The name usually given to a succession of
          distinguished English divines and philosophers of the
          seventeenth century, also known to their contemporaries as
          "Latitude Men," from the breadth and comprehensiveness of their
          teaching. The most important of them were Benjamin Whichcote,
          John Smith, Ralph Cudworth, and Henry More. Other members of the
          school were Simon Patrick, Nathanael Culverwel, John
          Worthington, George Rust, and Edward Fowler; while Joseph
          Glanvill and John Norris, though Oxford men, were so intimately
          associated with it as to be sometimes included. Starting with
          many of the same thoughts as their immediate predecessors in the
          development of liberal or rational thought, Hales and
          Chillingworth, they aimed less than these at ecclesiastical
          comprehension; their purpose was to find a higher organon of
          Christian thought, and to vindicate the essential principles of
          Christianity against both dogmatic excesses within the Church
          and philosophical extravagances without it. Unlike the former,
          too, they all came from the Puritan side; with the exception of
          More, their leaders were members of the famous Puritan college
          of Emmanuel, and thus closely bound together into a definite
          group or school. The main source of their inspiration was the
          study of the Platonic philosophy, not only in Plato himself but
          in his Alexandrian and modern disciples. This Platonic revival
          was important as evoking the only force adequate to meet the
          development of naturalism in a direction which threatened the
          distinctive principles of religion. But if Platonism was the
          positive determinant factor in the movement, the negative
          influence which formed the school was opposition to the
          destructive reasoning of Hobbes, whose materialistic tendency
          they met not only, like Clarendon and others, by polemical
          criticism, but by a well-ordered scheme of thought, whose
          principles had been already worked into unison with Christian
          philosophy. Of their permanent achievements, not the least
          important was their inculcation of the doctrine of toleration,
          at that time so novel and unpopular. They solved the religious
          problem, not by giving it up, but by pushing it to its
          legitimate conclusion and drawing the essential distinction
          between dogma and religion, which is one of their chief
          contributions to modern thought. Against the materialism of
          their time, they labored to prove that religion was a
          transcendent reality, a substantive power binding the soul to
          God and revealing God to the soul. Their writings are frequently
          obscure and involved, and they show a lack of critical and
          historical judgment in their confusion of Platonism and
          Neoplatonism, in their speculative fancifulness, and in their
          misappreciation of evidence. But their services to their age can
          scarcely be overrated. The exponents and advocates of a
          comprehensive Church, the purifiers of the popular theology,
          they were at the same time the great champions of the reality of
          religion at a time when the excesses of its partizans were
          driving so many of their contemporaries into unbelief. See the
          separate articles on the various men named above.

   Camel
          CAMEL: The most valuable possession of the nomads of the desert.

          The Syrian and Egyptian camel is the single-humped, lank, and
          long-legged Camelus dromedarius. Its foremost utility is that of
          common carrier ("ship of the mainland" was its poetical
          designation even prior to Islam). Great bodily strength and
          endurance fit it for this service. Its very voracity is content
          with the meanest fodder of the driest pasture greases,
          half-dried acacia twigs, dry straw, and the like; and it can
          toil days at a time upon an exceedingly small stint of forage.
          At such times the fatty hump, which when in good condition
          weighs as much as thirty pounds, almost entirely disappears. It
          is no less easily satisfied in the article of water. In spring
          it feeds on freshly dewed grasses, and can dispense with
          watering several weeks running. In the dry season it can hold
          out three or four days without water; and then, when it reaches
          a watering-place, it swallows the water in enormous quantities.
          Its broad, fleshy, cushioned foot prevents it from sinking
          deeply into the desert sand.

          The carrier camel bears ordinarily from two to three
          hundredweight; still more on occasion (cf. II Kings viii. 9).
          Its gait at a walk is about two and one-half miles an hour, and
          it maintains this pace right along with alacrity and freshness
          for twelve or fourteen hours and even longer. The riding camel
          differs from the foregoing, just as a noble race-horse from the
          heavy draft-horse. It can cover as much as ninety miles a day,
          and this for several days together. The camel saddle is a
          trough-shaped wooden seat fastened over the hump with a tight
          gearing both front and back. This is covered with a cushion. The
          rider sits as on a side-saddle. For women and children
          palanquins are likewise in use, with seats and curtains (Gen.
          xxiv. 61, xxxi. 17). The camel ministers to the Bedouins'
          every-day needs. The rather thick and fatty camel's milk is
          their beverage; and their horses often drink it. The flesh of
          the camel, except that of the hump, which is esteemed a peculiar
          delicacy, is said to be hard and tough; but still it is a feast
          for the Bedouin to kill one of the herd and eat meat. They also
          occasionally bleed the camel a little in times of scarceness.
          The Israelites accounted camel's flesh unclean. The Bedouins'
          coarse cloaks are woven of camel's hair (Matt. iii. 4), and also
          their thick tent-rugs. The hide is worked into sandals, thongs,
          water-skins, and the like. The dung is dried and then serves for
          fuel.

          The camel naturally is less important in agricultural Palestine.
          Yet even here it has its usefulness as beast of burden; and when
          heavy loads and great distances are in question, horses and
          mules are not to be compared with it. In the Old Testament the
          breeding of camels on a large scale is found under the
          patriarchs (Gen. xii. 18, xxiv. 10, xxx. 43) and David (I Chron.
          xxvii. 30). But in every era there is reference to the manifold
          uses of camels (e.g., II Kings viii. 9; Isa. xxx. 8; I Chron.
          xii. 40; Ezra ii. 67; Neh. vii. 69). To the poet the camel in
          its wild raging during the rutting season is an image of the
          nations which in their blind passion are devoted to strange gods
          (Jer. ii. 23).

   Camerarius (Camermeister), Joachim
          CAMERARIUS, c??´´mê-ra´ri-us (CAMERMEISTER), JOACHIM: Protestant
          humanist; b. at Bamberg Apr. 12, 1500; d. at Leipsic Apr. 17,
          1574. He was descended from an old Bamberg family and was
          educated there till his thirteenth year, when his parents sent
          him to the University of Leipsic, where he devoted himself
          chiefly to the study of Greek under Richard Crocus, Johann
          Metzler, and Peter Mosellanus. Subsequently he removed to the
          University of Erfurt, where he joined the circle of the
          humanists, became master of arts (1520), and was highly esteemed
          and admired for his knowledge of Greek. In 1521 he went to the
          University of Wittenberg, where he became intimately acquainted
          with Melanchthon. In 1525 he accompanied Melanchthon on his
          journey to the Palatinate, and thence proceeded to Basel to pay
          homage to Erasmus. In the same year he left Wittenberg and went
          to Bamberg. From here he accompanied Canon Fuchs on a journey to
          Prussia (1525) and in 1526 was called, upon recommendation of
          Melanchthon, to the gymnasium of Nuremberg as teacher of Greek
          and expounder of the Latin historians. A visit to Melanchthon at
          Speyer in 1529 during the diet held at that city brought him
          into immediate contact with the ecclesiastical and political
          affairs of the time; he also took part in the Diet of Augsburg
          in 1535. Conditions at Nuremberg did not satisfy him, although
          he had intercourse with men like W. Pirkheimer, W. Linck,
          Osiander, Lazarus Spengler, and Albrecht Dürer. As early as 1528
          he complained of the coldness and indifference toward the
          humanistic sciences on the part of his contemporaries. His
          school also did not make progress, and in 1535 he gladly
          followed a call to Tübingen, where he found a fruitful field for
          his activity as teacher. In 1541 he removed to Leipsic. Although
          Camerarius took part in the ecclesiastical dissensions of the
          time, his chief importance lies in the field of humanism and
          pedagogics. In his first pedagogical treatise Præcepta
          honestatis atque decoris puerilis (1528) he emphasized as a true
          disciple of Melanchthon humanistic education as a necessary
          preparation for all later vocations, but humanistic education,
          as he holds, has its foundation in the reverence of God. In
          accordance with his view that the Christian religion should be
          taught alongside of the rudiments of the languages, he edited
          the chief articles of Christianity in Greek hexameters,
          translated the Augsburg Confession into Greek and composed a
          catechism in the same language. His biographical works are of
          great value as sources, and show that he was a keen observer,
          especially his Narratio de Eobano Hesso, etc. (Nuremberg, 1553),
          Narratio de Georgio Principe Anhtaltino (Leipsic, 1555), and his
          famous writing De Philippi Melanchthonis ortu, totius vitæ
          curriculo et morte, implicata rerum memorabilium temporis illius
          hominumque mentione . . . narratio (Leipsic, 1566; best ed. with
          copious notes by S. T. Strobel, Halle, 1777; the text reprinted
          by A. F. Neander, Berlin, 1841). Another prominent work,
          measured by the standards of his time, is his Historica narratio
          de Fratrum Orthodoxorum ecclesiis in Bohemia, Moravia et
          Polonia, which was first edited in 1605 by his grandson Joachim
          Ludwig Camerarius and is still valuable. Camerarius also edited
          (though badly) the letters of Melanchthon (Leipsic, 1569), and
          rendered great services to historical research by his collection
          of letters from the time of the Reformation, which was continued
          by his son.

          CAMERON, GEORGE GORDON: Free Church of Scotland; b. at
          Pluscarden (a village near Elgin, 71 m. n.w. of Aberdeen),
          Elginshire, Sept. 13, 1836. He was educated at University and
          King's College, Aberdeen (M.A., 1860), Free Church College,
          Aberdeen (1860-62), and New College, Edinburgh (1863-65). He was
          a tutor on the Continent in 1862--63 and in 1865-66 was
          assistant minister in Leghorn, Italy. He was then assistant
          minister in Dundee, Scotland, for a year and at Kuthrieston,
          Aberdeen, in 1867-69, and after another year as temporary
          professor of Hebrew in Free Church College in 1869-70 was
          assistant minister for brief periods at St. Andrews, Edinburgh,
          London, and North Leith in 1870-71. In the latter year he was
          ordained associate minister of St. John's Free Church, Glasgow,
          and retained this position until 1882, when he was appointed to
          the chair of Old Testament language and literature in the United
          Free Church College, Aberdeen, where he still remains. He is a
          member of various committees for the general work of his sect,
          and has written, in addition to contributions to periodicals,
          Memorials of John Roxburgh (Glasgow, 1881).

   Cameron (Camero), John
          CAMERON (CAMERO), JOHN: Scottish theologian; b. at Glasgow c.
          1579; d. at Montauban, France, 1625. He studied at Glasgow and
          began to give lessons in Greek there at the age of twenty. In
          1600 he went to Bordeaux and was soon appointed professor of the
          humanities at Bergerac. From 1601 to 1603 he was professor of
          divinity at Sédan. Then he returned to Bordeaux and received a
          scholarship enabling him to complete his theological studies. He
          became tutor in the family of Calignon and went with his pupils
          to Paris, Geneva, and Heidelberg. At the university of the
          last-named place on Apr. 4, 1608, he supported in a public
          discussion theses de triplici Dei cum homine foedere. Later in
          the same year he became a minister at Bordeaux and had great
          success as a preacher. When the Protestants were driven from the
          town after eight years he took refuge at Tonneins. He was
          appointed professor at the Academy of Saumur in 1618. In 1620 he
          participated in a discussion at Orléans with Tilenus, formerly
          professor at Sédan, and controverted his Arminian propositions.
          In 1622 James I. of England called him to London and appointed
          him principal and professor of theology at Glasgow. But the
          jealousy of many of his colleagues forced him to leave his
          native town and in 1623 he returned to Saumur. The following
          year the king authorized him to teach at Montauban. He arrived
          there at a time when there was violent contention on the
          question of obedience to the king and took sides with the party
          of passive obedience. On May 15, 1625, he was injured in a
          public tumult and died in consequence a few months later. His
          works are: Discours apologéique pour ceux de la religion
          réformée (Bergerac, 1614); Traité auquel sont examinés les
          préjugés de ceux de l'Église romaine contre la religion réformée
          (La Rochelle, 1616; Eng. transl., Oxford, 1624); Theses de
          gratia et libero arbitrio (Saumur, 1618); Amica collatio de
          gratiæ et humanæ voluntatis concursu in vocatione (Leyden,
          1621); Defensio sententiæ de gratia et libero arbitrio (Saumur,
          1624); and Prælectiones (3 vols., 1626-28).

          Falkland, Fifeshire; killed at Ayrsmoss or Airdamoss, Ayrshire,
          July 22, 1680), and his followers. Brought up in the Church of
          Scotland, early impressed by the services of those ministers
          who, ejected by the [679]Act of Uniformity of 1662, continued to
          preach in the fields, Cameron adopted and advocated their view
          that it was wrong to accept the [680]Declaration of Indulgence
          of 1662, although it mitigated their lot. Licensed by these
          field preachers, although without university training, he soon
          became a leader. In 1679 he went to Holland, whither many of his
          persecuted countrymen had gone after the defeat in the battle of
          Bothwell Bridge, June 22,1679; in 1680 he returned and with
          [681]Donald Cargill and Thomas Douglas headed the party, which
          after him was celled "Cameronians," or impersonally "Society
          People." Their platform was the Declaration of Sanquhar
          (published June 22, 1680), drawn up by Cameron and others. In it
          the royal authority was disowned because of its tyranny. This
          action brought Cameron and his followers immediately into
          trouble. A band with him at its head was attacked by the royal
          troops and literally cut to pieces.

          The party lived in and were united in "societies," which had
          become somewhat numerous before the Revolution. They welcomed
          King William; but they did not approve of the Revolution
          settlement, and did not join the Established Church. They
          objected to the Church which had made many unworthy compromises;
          were displeased at the want of recognition of the covenants; did
          not consider that the independence of the Church was secured;
          and generally believed that God was not sufficiently honored in
          the new settlement. They objected, too, to the recognition of
          Erastianism in England. In 1706 the Rev. John Macmillan of
          Balmaghie joined the societies, and was their first minister. In
          1743, another minister having joined them, they constituted "the
          Reformed Presbytery." In 1774 a similar presbytery was formed in
          the United States. A presbytery was constituted likewise in
          Ireland. About 1863 most of the Scotch synod came to be of
          opinion that there was nothing in their principles requiring
          them to abstain from countenancing the political institutions of
          the country, e.g., from voting for a member of Parliament; but,
          a small minority having a different opinion, a disruption took
          place. In 1876 a union took place between the larger body and
          the Free Church of Scotland. Although "Cameronians" has always
          been a common name given to those who refused to accept the
          settlement of Church and State under William and Mary, they
          repudiated it themselves, preferring to be called "Reformed
          Presbyterians." See [682]Covenanters; [683]Presbyterians.

   Camisards
          CAMISARDS, cam´i-z??rds: The name generally applied to those
          French Protestants who, in the reign of Louis XIV., rose in arms
          in Languedoc and waged a bloody war (1702-05) for the purpose of
          restoring their Church.

    Origin.

          Their name was derived from the jacket (camisia) which they wore
          over their clothes during their night attacks. Neither the
          dragonades nor the revocation of the Edict of Nantes (1685)
          succeeded in destroying Protestantism in France; but, though
          private worship was never forbidden, new laws were continually
          enacted by Louis XIV. in his attempt to enforce conformity in
          religion throughout France, which made it more and more
          difficult, and at last almost impossible, for a French citizen
          to adhere to the Reformed confession. In 1686 and the following
          years the gatherings in the desert were forbidden, and fines,
          imprisonment, demolition of homes, the galleys, and the wheel
          were employed as punishments. Nevertheless, with the pressure
          grew the power of resistance. Religious meetings were held by
          night in secluded places, originally presided over by refugee
          clergy, and later by men of little learning, but fervent in
          prayers and exhortations.

          As was natural, the miseries of the time produced a
          corresponding hope of the future; and books like Pierre Jurieu's
          L'Accomplissement des prophéties (Rotterdam, 1686) and Suite de
          l'accomplissement (1687), in which he predicted the speedy
          downfall of the papacy, contributed to give shape and direction
          to this unconscious movement. A girl appeared as prophetess in
          Dauphiné in 1688. Other prophets arose in Vivarais. The number
          increased rapidly, especially in the Cévennes after 1700, where
          almost a fourth of the population was Protestant. Despite the
          creation of new bishoprics for their conversion and
          notwithstanding the military aid given by the State to the
          ecclesiastical authorities, ecstatic phenomena increased
          throughout the district, sparing neither old nor young.

    Fanatical Disorders.

          In the trance, when seized by convulsions, and pouring forth
          words of repentance and admonition, often in pure French instead
          of the local dialect, those "possessed by the spirit" saw troops
          from far-off garrisons come marching toward the place, they
          singled out those among their comrades who should fall in the
          encounter, they recognized the traitors among them; and these
          predictions were always accepted with reverence and confidence,
          and often proved true; although, on the other hand, the power of
          prophecy later steadily declined. Without this apocalyptic
          factor, diseased yet sincere, the enthusiasm and obstinacy of
          the Camisards is unintelligible. Terming themselves "children of
          God," and their camp the "camp of the Eternal," they relied with
          absolute trust on divine guidance and aid, while their
          fanaticism in destroying churches, like their cruelty in killing
          priests, finds its explanation in the fact that they believed
          themselves called of God to extirpate "Babylon and Satan," as
          they designated the Roman Catholic priests and their Church.

    The Camisard Wars.

          Open revolt broke out in 1702, when a priest named François de
          Langlade du Chayla undertook to punish the refractory. In his
          house at Pont de Montvert, in the present department of Lozère,
          he built a cell in which he shut up his recalcitrant
          parishioners, and tortured them. On the night of July 23,
          hearing a rumor that the abbé intended to put certain prisoners
          to death, the Camisards assembled at the instigation of the
          prophets Séguier, Couderc, and Mazel, burned the house,
          liberated the prisoners, and slew the priest. Bâville, the
          intendant of Languedoc, felt a particular satisfaction in
          pursuing the guilty. Séguier was caught and burned at the stake
          Aug. 12; but the rest escaped among the mountains, where they
          were soon reenforced by new throngs formed by Castanet, Catinat,
          Roland, and others. In Jean Cavalier (b. at Ribante, department
          of Gard, Nov. 28, 1681) they found an able leader, and the war
          began which was to depopulate and devastate the provinces of
          Languedoc, Vivarais, Gevaudan, and Rouergue. The Camisards never
          numbered more than five thousand, and they had no military
          organization. But they fought with brutal fury, even when they
          marched into battle with psalms on their lips, while the royal
          troops punished them with torture and imprisonment. In their
          camps they lived as in a church, preaching, praying, and
          fasting; and they won brilliant victories, particularly at
          Sainte-Chatte, Mar. 15, 1704. Bâville was unable to make head
          against them, and in Feb., 1703, Marshal Montreval was sent with
          a large body of troops. He defeated the Camisards repeatedly (La
          Jonguière, Mar. 6; La Tour de Bélot, Apr. 29), but the cruelties
          practised by the troops won new adherents to the Protestant
          cause, even though he razed all the houses and villages in the
          upper Cévennes, thus rendering 20,000 homeless. The confusion
          was increased by a bull of Clement XI. (May 1, 1703),
          proclaiming a crusade against the heretics and creating bands
          which equaled their opponents in savagery. In Apr., 1704,
          Montreval was replaced by Marshal Villars. Before Villars began
          active operation, he surrounded the whole district with a line
          of strong military poets, thus cutting off all communication
          between the rebels and the outside world; and then he offered
          pardon to all who, within a certain time, laid down arms and
          surrendered. Cavalier, who saw that further resistance was
          useless, left the country, afterward fought against his
          countrymen in Holland, Italy, and Spain, and settled finally in
          England. There he was appointed governor of Jersey, and later
          governor of the Isle of Wight. He died in Chelsea, London, May
          18, 1740. His former comrades branded him as a traitor and
          continued the hopeless struggle. Roland fell Aug. 14, 1704.
          Castanet, Catinat, Joanni, and others fled to Geneva. Without
          leaders, the Camisard army gradually melted away. In 1705
          Catinat, Ravanel, and some of their colleagues returned and
          conspired to raise a new revolt, only to die at the stake or on
          the wheel. A last attempt, made by Mazel, Coste, and Claris in
          1709 in Vivarais was quenched in blood, and the French Reformed
          Church was definitely blotted out. [In England the Camisards
          were known as the [685]French Prophets.]

   Campanella, Tomaso
          CAMPANELLA, TOMASO: Italian monk and philosopher; b. at Stilo
          (50 m. n.e. of Reggio), Calabria, Sept. 5, 1588; d. in Paris May
          21, 1639. He entered the Dominican order at the age of fifteen;
          studied philosophy and theology at Cosenza and Naples, and added
          to his other accomplishments a knowledge of medicine, astrology,
          alchemy, and magic. He boldly rejected the Aristotelian system
          and chose to study nature rather than authority, whereby he made
          many and powerful opponents. After wandering through Italy for a
          number of years he returned to Cosenza in 1598, and the next
          year was arrested by the government, charged, probably
          truthfully, with being implicated in a conspiracy to free Naples
          from the Spanish dominion. His political and social views were
          undeniably dangerous. He was kept in prison till 1626, when Pope
          Urban VIII. succeeded in having him transferred to the
          Inquisition, and in 1629 set him free. For a few years he lived
          at Rome, but, not feeling secure there, in 1634 he went to
          Paris, where he was received with favor by Cardinal Richelieu.
          His last years were spent in preparing a complete edition of his
          works, of which, however, only one or two volumes appear to have
          been published. The philosophy which Campanella would substitute
          for that of Aristotle was incomplete and fantastic, influenced
          by Thomas Aquinas, Bernardino Telesio (b. at Cosenza 1508),
          Raymond Lully, and the Cabala, but in part independent and in
          certain points anticipatory of the work of more modern thinkers.
          He held that God has made a twofold revelation of himself, in
          nature and in the Bible; on the one rests philosophy, on the
          other theology. These have nothing to do the one with the other.
          He was thus able to take a very conservative position in
          theology, and stoutly defended Roman Catholicism and the papacy
          (as in his Monarchiæ Messiæ and Discorsi della liberta e della
          felice suggettione allo stato ecclesiastico, Jesi, 1633).
          Certainty, he taught, is found only in immediate intuitions; the
          first truth is that I exist; then that I can, that I know, and
          that I want or will; these three activities indicate the
          fundamental qualities of all being (potentia, sapientia, amor).
          He believed that matter is eternal and that the world was
          created through emanations from the deity. His views concerning
          society and the State were communistic; they are set forth in
          his Civitas solis, idea reipublicæ philosophicæ, printed as an
          appendix to part iii. (politica) of his Realis philosophiæ
          epilogisticæ partes iv, hoc est, de rerum natura, hominum
          moribus, politica, et oeconomica (Frankfort, 1623); there is an
          English translation (incomplete) by T. W. Halliday in Ideal
          Commonwealths, vol. xxiii. of "Morley's Universal Library"
          (London, 1885).

          n.e. of Mæstricht) in Belgium; d. at Jülich (Juliers, 15 m. n.e,
          of Aachen) c. 1575. He studied at Cologne, whence he was
          expelled in 1520 for opposing the scholastic doctors; went to
          Jülich and was noted for his vehement Lutheranism; went to
          Wittenberg in 1527; was present at the Conference of Marburg in
          1529, and surprised both sides by his presentation of the view
          that the bread is indeed bread and at the same time the body of
          Christ because he makes it so. He was not, however, allowed to
          take part in the debate. This snub and others incurred by his
          tendency to unorthodox views turned him against the Reformers
          and them against him. He was called insane because he would not
          yield to their arguments. So he was repeatedly imprisoned and
          died a prisoner. In 1530 he prepared a book in Latin and German
          "Against All the World Since the Apostles" and circulated it in
          manuscript--no complete or printed copy is known to east, but
          extracts have been preserved in a manuscript by Bugenhagen (cf.
          ZHT, 1846, pp. 495 sqq. ). In 1532 one of his followers, Franz
          von Streitten, published a popular restatement of his views
          which he dedicated to King Frederick of Denmark. He taught that
          the Holy Spirit was not the Third Person but the common essence
          of the two, while the Son was not coeternal with the Father but,
          created out of his essence, before all creatures. He was
          likewise an Anabaptist and in general a radical.

   Campbell, Alexander
          CAMPBELL, ALEXANDER: Founder of the [686]Disciples of Christ; b.
          near Ballymena (a mile from Shane's Castle on the northern shore
          of Lough Neagh), County Antrim, Ireland, Sept. 12, 1788; d. at
          Bethany, W. Va., Mar. 4, 1866. He was the son of Thomas
          Campbell, a Seceder minister, and Jane Carneigle. Educated at
          Glasgow University, he went to America in 1809, whither his
          father had preceded him two years earlier, and settled in
          western Pennsylvania. While at Glasgow he had come in contact
          with James Alexander and [687]Robert Haldane and was greatly
          impressed by their teaching. On joining his father, he found
          Providence had guided him into the same liberal and independent
          views.

    His Father, Thomas Campbell.

          Thomas Campbell's fraternity with other Christians, his
          indifference to ecclesiastical rules, and his pleadings in
          behalf of Christian liberty and brotherhood had brought upon him
          the censure of his brethren; consequently he withdrew from them
          and continued to plead for Christian liberty and union, dwelling
          upon the evil of divisions in religious society, urging the
          Sacred word as an infallible standard and all-sufficient and
          alone-sufficient basis of union, and setting forth one rule to
          govern himself and his associates: "where the Scriptures speak,
          we speak; and where the Scriptures are silent, we are silent."
          On Sept. 7, 1809, he formed The Christian Association of
          Washington and issued his famous Declaration and Address (see
          [688]Disciples of Christ). In May, 1811, The First Church of the
          Christian Association of Washington Co., Pa., was organized at
          Brush Run with twenty-nine members; here Alexander Campbell was
          ordained to the ministry Jan. 1, 1812.

    Adopts Baptist Views.

          Mr. Campbell's marriage in 1812 to Margaret Brown, a
          Presbyterian, turned his attention to the subject of baptism.
          After diligent study of the Scriptures and critical examination
          of the words "baptize" and "baptism," he became satisfied they
          could mean only "immerse" and "immersion," and that believers
          only could be the proper subjects of this ordinance. With his
          father and five others he was immersed by Mathias Luse, June 14,
          1812. "I have set out," he said, "to follow the Apostles of
          Christ and their master, and I will be baptised only into the
          primitive Christian faith" From this time Thomas Campbell
          conceded to his son the guidance of the movement he had
          originated. The Brush Run church joined the Redstone Baptist
          Association after full statement of their views, using the
          primitive Confession of faith instead of a religious experience,
          and breaking bread weekly without restricted communion. A second
          church on the same basis was organized in Wellsburg, W. Va.

    Public Debates.

          In 1820 Mr. Campbell held his first public discussion. He was
          not disputatious, and at first declined a challenge, but it was
          forced upon him. The debate was with the Rev. John Walker, a
          Presbyterian, and the chief point debated was the identity of
          the covenants upon which the Jewish and Christian institutions
          rested. His later discussions with Rev. N. L. Rice on baptism,
          the Holy Spirit, and human creeds as bonds of union, a debate
          which lasted sixteen days and over which Henry Clay presided
          (1843), with Robert Owen on the claims of Christianity (at
          Cincinnati, 1829), and with Archbishop Purcell on the claims of
          Roman Catholicism (also at Cincinnati, 1837) are masterpieces of
          discussion which created a profound impression in their time and
          did much to extend the principles advocated by Mr. Campbell.

    His Views and Aims.

          In 1823 Mr. Campbell began the publication of The Christian
          Baptist. In the first seven years from his little country
          printing-office he issued 46,000 volumes of his works. His
          writings were read far and wide. His views began to influence
          large numbers of people. He was assailed as a disorganizer, but
          it was not his aim merely to overthrow the existing order of
          religious society. He was well aware of the vast benefit
          resulting to mankind from Christianity even in its most corrupt
          forms. He desired simply to dethrone the false that he might
          reestablish the true, to replace the traditions of men by the
          teachings of Christ and the Apostles; to substitute the New
          Testament for creeds and human formularies. His work was
          positive, not negative. In 1825 he published in The Christian
          Baptist a series of articles entitled A Restoration of the
          Ancient Order of Things, in which he argued for the abandonment
          of everything not in use among the early Christians, such as
          creeds and confessions, unscriptural words and phrases,
          theological speculations, etc., and for the adoption of
          everything sanctioned by primitive practise, as the weekly
          breaking of the loaf, the fellowship, the simple order of
          worship, and the independence of each church under the care of
          elders and deacons. His plea was not for a reformation, but for
          a restoration of the original Church.

          In 1826 Mr. Campbell published The Sacred Writings of the
          Apostles and Evangelists of Jesus Christ, Commonly Styled the
          New Testament, with notes. In this work he Anglicized the Greek
          words commonly rendered "baptism," "baptize," etc., being the
          first to do so in an English version: The principles taught by
          the Campbells were now wide-spread, especially among the
          Baptists; but in 1827 Baptist Associations began to declare
          non-fellowship with the brethren of "the Reformation" and from
          this time dates the rise of the people known as the Disciples of
          Christ.

    His Most Active Years.

          In 1829 Mr. Campbell began to publish the Millennial Harbinger,
          a magazine which he continued to issue monthly until his death.
          In October of the same year he sat in the Virginia State
          Constitutional Convention. Ex-President Madison, one of his
          fellow delegates, said of him afterward: "I regard him as the
          ablest and most original expounder of Scripture I ever heard."
          In 1840 he founded Bethany College with the Bible as a
          text-book. In 1847 he traveled and preached in Great Britain.
          This was his busiest period; he traveled thousands of miles,
          lectured and preached constantly, edited, presided over the
          College, and held public discussions. In June, 1850, he spoke
          before both houses of Congress at the Capitol at Washington. He
          was gifted with a fine presence, with great ease and skill of
          utterance, with fine argumentative powers, and with a great fund
          of information. He was a man of profound piety and broad
          philanthropy. "Surely," said George D. Prentice, "the life of a
          man thus excellent and gifted is a part of the common treasure
          of society. In this essential character he belongs to no party,
          but to the world." His publications include sixty volumes.

          College, Aberdeen, and began the study of law in Edinburgh, but
          changed to theology, which he pursued there and in Aberdeen; was
          ordained minister of Banchory Ternan (on the Dee, 20 m. from
          Aberdeen), 1748; became one of the ministers of Aberdeen, 1757;

          1771; resigned on account of ill health, 1795. He was one of the
          founders in 1758 of a famous philosophical society of Aberdeen,
          which included among its members Thomas Reid, John Gregory,
          James Beattie, and other distinguished men. His publications
          were sermons and A Dissertation on Miracles, an answer to Hume's
          Essay (Edinburgh, 1762; 3d ed., with corrections and additions
          and correspondence between Hume and Campbell, 2 vols., 1797);

          vols., London, 1776; many subsequent editions); The Four
          Gospels, translated from the Greek, with preliminary
          dissertations and notes, critical and explanatory (2 vols.,
          1789). Posthumous publications were Lectures on Ecclesiastical
          History, with a brief Life by G. S. Keith (2 vols., London,
          1800), and Lectures on Systematic Theology and on Pulpit
          Eloquence (1807). A collected edition of his Theological Works
          appeared in six volumes at London, 1840.

          Glasgow), Dumbartonshire, Feb. 27, 1872. He studied at Glasgow
          1811-20, sad continued his theological course at Edinburgh;
          became minister of Row (near Helensburgh), Dumbartonshire, 1825.
          Here he preached "assurance of faith" and an "unlimited
          atonement." and in consequence was tried for heresy and deposed
          by the General Assembly in 1831 (cf. the volume of his Sermons
          and Lectures, Greenock, 1832, and The Whole Proceedings Before
          the Presbytery of Dumbarton and the Synod of Glasgow and Ayr in
          the Case of the Rev. John McLeod Campbell, 1831). He retired to
          Kilninver, preached in the Highlands for a year or two, and in
          1833 became pastor of an independent congregation in Glasgow and
          remained there till compelled to retire by ill health in 1859.
          His services were given gratuitously and were very successful.
          He was recognized as one of the intellectual leaders of Scotland
          and was highly esteemed for his personal qualities. His theory
          of the atonement, by which he was best known outside of Glasgow,
          he expressed in this sentence in the book on the Atonement
          mentioned below: "It was the spiritual essence and nature of the
          sufferings of Christ, and not that these sufferings were penal,
          which constituted their value as entering into the atonement
          made by the Son of God, when he put away sin by a sacrifice of
          himself." He published Christ the Bread of Life, (Glasgow,
          1851), a book on the Eucharist suggested by the Roman Catholic
          controversy of the time; The Nature of the Atonement and its
          relation to remission of sin's and eternal life (Cambridge,
          1856; 4th ed., 1873); Thoughts on Revelation (1862), called

   Campeggio (Campegi, Campeggi, Campegius), Lorenzo
          CAMPEGGIO, c??m-ped´jO (CAMPEGI, CAMPEGGI, CAMPEGIUS), LORENZO:
          Italian cardinal and statesman; b. at Milan Nov. 7, 1474; d. at
          Rome July 25, 1539. His father was a noted professor of law at
          Pavia, Padua, and Bologna, and the son, adopting his father's
          career, became lecturer on imperial and papal law and the
          Decretals at Bologna after 1499. He participated in the
          political life of the university town and won the attention of
          the Curia by his ardent advocacy of the papal cause against the
          imperial family of Bentivogli. The loss of his wife hastened his
          entrance into the priestly state, for which he had long
          cherished a strong inclination. Julius II. made him
          representative for Bologna at the tribunal of the Rota in Rome
          in the early part of 1511. In August he went as nuncio to the
          court of the emperor Maximilian to win that ruler away from his
          support of the Pisan council and for the pope's scheme of a
          Lateran council. Returning successful in 1512 he was made bishop
          of Feltre and sent as nuncio to the court of Maximilian Sforza
          at Milan, but was recalled to be entrusted with a second mission
          to the imperial court with the object, this time, of furthering
          the papal plan for the reestablishment of general peace in
          Europe. At this post he remained till 1517, when on account of
          his "preeminent services to the Apostolic chair" and for a fee
          of 24,000 ducats he was created cardinal in company with thirty
          others. Once more Campeggio was sent on a mission of universal
          peace, this time to England, where he shared the dignity of
          papal legate with Cardinal Wolsey and participated in the
          formation of the General League of Peace concluded in October,
          1518. In the same year he returned to Rome, bearing with him
          many royal gifts and the promise of the succession to the
          bishopric of Salisbury. He became bishop of Bologna in 1523, but
          resigned the office two years later on acquiring possession of
          the promised English see and retained it till 1535. He enjoyed
          at the same time the profits from a Spanish bishopric and from
          other churches, though it is difficult to determine precisely
          which. Alone among the cardinals he seems to have won the
          confidence of Adrian VI. and to him (not to Egidio of Viterbo)
          must be attributed the authorship of the reform memorial
          addressed to the pope. After the ill success of the papal cause
          at the first diet of Nuremberg, Campeggio was sent to Germany to
          work for the enforcement of the Edict of Worms. At the second
          Nuremberg diet he met the demands of the German princes with
          insulting pride, but by all his efforts could not prevent the
          assembly from expressing the demand for a meeting of the
          representatives of the German nation to consider means for the
          settlement of the religious question. It was Campeggio who was
          primarily responsible for the league concluded at Regensburg in
          the summer of 1524 by the enemies of the Reformation, the first
          of the partizan confederations that were to result in the
          dismemberment of the nation. At Regensburg, too, a scheme of
          reform for the clergy was formulated by Campeggio with the aid
          of Nausea and Cochlæus, a scheme, however, which never attained
          practical effect. An unsuccessful mission to England in 1528-29
          in the matter of the divorce of Henry VIII. was followed by an
          appointment to the imperial court, where he is known to have
          advised Charles V. in case a policy of conciliation toward the
          Protestants proved ineffective "to eradicate the poisonous
          growth with fire and sword." At the same time he did not disdain
          to attempt the milder means of bribery, notably in the case of
          Melanchthon. In 1532 Campeggio returned to Rome. His last phase
          of activity was in connection with the plans of Paul III. for a
          general council. A memorial on the Centum gravamina Germanorum,
          written in 1536, shows that by that time Campeggio had arrived
          at a different view of the claims and rights of the German
          nation.

          1868. Feeling himself unable, however, to accept the dogma of
          papal infallibility, he resigned his office in 1881 and became a
          member of the Methodist Episcopal Church. Later he joined the
          Protestant Episcopal Church, and founded the Reformed Italian
          Catholic Church, of which he was consecrated bishop by Bishop E.
          Herzog in Switzerland. He worked for many years, first in Rome
          without success and later in Umbria, but in 1902 returned to the
          Roman Catholic faith. He wrote: Cenni autobiografici che rendono

          CAMPION, EDMUND: Jesuit; b. in London Jan. 25, 1540; hanged
          there at Tyburn Dec. 1, 1581. He won much distinction for
          ability and scholarship at school in London, and had a brilliant
          career at St. John's College, Oxford (B.A., 1561; M.A., 1565);
          in 1567 he was ordained deacon in the Church of England, but,
          having always been a Roman Catholic at heart, in 1569 or 1570 he
          went to Ireland, hoping to find employment in a new university
          to be located in Dublin. The scheme fell through and he returned
          to England, went thence to Douai, where he openly renounced
          Protestantism, finished his theological studies, and took the
          degree of B.D. In 1573 he joined the Jesuits in Rome, and was
          sent to Prague, where he was ordained deacon and priest in 1578.
          In June. 1580, he entered England as a missionary of his order,
          and preached and worked there with success until July, 1581,
          when he was arrested and committed to the Tower. He was treated
          with much severity, was several times examined under torture,
          and in November was condemned, after an unfair trial, upon a
          charge of having conspired to dethrone the queen. He is
          described by Protestants as well as Roman Catholics as a man of
          uncommon ability, an eloquent orator, of much diplomatic skill,
          and amiable in disposition and life. His chief work was the
          Decem rationes, in which he challenges the Protestants to meet
          him in debate and professes himself ready to prove the falsity
          of Protestantism and the truth of the Roman Catholic religion by
          argument upon any one of ten topics, finished about Easter,
          1581, and printed ostensibly at Douai, but really in or near
          London, the same year; it was spread broadcast at commencement
          at Oxford in June (best edition by Silvester Petra-Sancta,
          Antwerp, 1631; Eng, transl., 1606, 1632, 1687, 1827). While in
          Ireland he wrote a history of the country which was used by
          Holinshed in compiling his Chronicles (1577), and was printed by
          Sir James Ware in his History of Ireland (Dublin, 1633;
          reprinted in Ancient Irish Histories, 1809).

   Camp-meetings
          CAMP-MEETINGS: Religious gatherings held in a grove, usually
          lasting for several days, during which many find shelter in
          tents or temporary houses. The main features are the open-air
          preaching, the night prayer-meetings, and the freedom of the
          life. They are not now so common as formerly. The first meeting
          of the kind is said to have taken place in Kentucky, on the
          banks of the Red River, in 1799, under a Presbyterian and a
          Methodist minister. These denominations at first used them in
          common; but gradually the Presbyterians withdrew, and they
          became almost exclusively Methodist and Baptist gatherings. In
          recent times the Methodists have purchased tracts of land in
          desirable locations on the seaboard or inland, and turned them
          into parks, with comfortable houses, streets, post-offices,
          meeting-places, Biblical models, etc., and there in the summer
          many persons live, and there the religious gatherings of
          different kinds are held daily. Thus the primitive camp-meeting
          is continued in an improved form. The credit of introducing
          campmeetings into England is due to the [692]Rev. Lorenzo Dow,
          an eccentric though able minister of Methodist views, who in
          1807 proposed it in Staffordshire. Two Methodists, William
          Clowes and Hugh Bourne, were so impressed with the advantages of
          this style of service that they persisted in holding them after
          they were disapproved by the Wesleyan Conference in 1807; for
          doing which they were finally expelled. In 1810 they founded the
          Primitive Methodists, which body uses the campmeeting, The Irish
          Wesleyans commenced using them in 1860.

          1629, but retired to the Hospital des Incurables in Paris 1651.
          He was an extremely prolific writer. The catalogue of his

          moral romances, which were admired in his time, and some
          translated into English, but are now forgotten. He is still
          remembered for his satirical pamphlets against the mendicant
          orders, e.g., Désappropriation Claustrelle and Pauvreté
          Evangélique, which were elaborately refuted in Anti-Camus

          The Conquest by the Hebrews (§ 12).

    1. The Name.

          Canaan, Canaanites, are names given in the Old Testament and
          elsewhere to the land acquired by the Hebrews and to the
          pre-Hebraic people who occupied it. Apart from a few cases of
          personification, Canaan is the general name applied to the
          country (Judges v. 19; in JE, Gen. xlii.; in P, Gen. xi. 31). It
          is formed from Kana with the addition of the n denoting place;
          the simple form does not occur in the Old Testament, but there
          is abundant evidence in the Amarna tablets and elsewhere that it
          was used. It is also clear that it was not originally a proper
          name. The significance of the word is not clear, though many
          attempts to discover it have been made. It seems in some places
          to have the signification of "Lowland" (Num. xiii. 29; Josh. v.
          1; Zeph. ii. 5). In some of the Egyptian inscriptions the word
          is used to denote the part of Asia under Egyptian control,
          including Phenicia; but the general custom of Egyptians was to
          designate southern Syria by H?aru and northern Syria by Rutennu.
          In the Amarna tablets it means what is now understood by Syria.
          Old Testament usage varies. In Gen. x. 19 (JE) it includes
          Phenicia, the land of Israel, and Philistia, with boundaries
          undefined on the north, a usage followed generally by D, though
          Deut. xi. 24 extends the eastern boundary to the Euphrates. The
          general statement is justified that in the Old Testament the
          name is used to designate what is now meant by Syria, without
          very definite boundaries, generally excluding lands east of the
          Jordan. And Canaanites designated the people who inhabited the
          land of Canaan, except that E uses "[694]Amorites" to express
          this meaning.

    2. Language and Religion.

          The question is suggested whether the Canaanites had anything in
          common apart from their dwelling in the land so designated. Isa.
          xix. 18 mentions "the language of Canaan," a phrase which
          implies that a common language was there used. Of course there
          were dialectical differences, say, between the north and the
          south, but these were not such that the inhabitant of one part
          could not understand the inhabitant of another. Historic and
          inscriptional evidence bears this out. Besides unity of language
          there was a common conception of religion. The deities were
          originally nature-powers such as the sun, the heavens, the moon,
          thunder and lightning. With advance of civilization they
          blended, while worship was still offered at numerous local
          shrines. At these the proper names of the deities were not
          generally used, the gods were spoken of as the Baal "Lord" or
          the Baalah "Mistress" of the place, e.g., Baal-Hermon, "Lord of
          Hermon." The places of worship were the tops of the hills (see
          [695]High Places). Near the altar stood a sacred stone or tree
          or pillar. If there were an image of the deity, there was also a
          temple or a house and a priest. The customs of worship were in
          the closest connection with the work of daily life, the
          offerings were of the products of field, garden, vineyard, or
          pasture. In the cities more developed forms took their place.
          The myth was everywhere employed, at first in local form, later
          in philosophical and poetical development in which origins,
          destinies, beginnings of human customs, and the beginnings of
          cities and holy localities had their place. In some places
          prostitution for religious purposes was practised, also
          self-mutilation and infant-sacrifice. There were also numerous
          practises which were survivals from primitive worship, from
          animism, totemism, and fetishism. The culture of the people had
          in general a common stamp. Babylonian influence had advanced by
          the third millennium B.C. at least as far south as central
          Syria. Egypt's influence was first felt about 1500 B.C. While
          northern Syria immediately bordered on the Euphrates, a desert
          stretched between southern Syria and Egypt. The fact that the
          Amarna tablets, which are classed as Egyptian documents, are in
          the cuneiform shows that Babylonian ideas were dominant, though
          some admixture of Egyptian ideas must be allowed.

    3. Commerce.

          The middle position of Syria, between the east and the west,
          between the desert and the sea, introduces another occupation
          besides those mentioned in which the inhabitants engaged,
          commerce. Before the sea was traversed by ships, the roads from
          the Euphrates to Egypt passed through north and south Syria.
          Sea-travel later opened up routes which included the
          Mediterranean and the Red Sea. The products of Canaan proper
          were small in proportion to those resulting from commercial
          operations. These became, therefore, the favorite employment of
          the Canaanites, and their name became synonymous with merchant
          (Ezek xvi. 29, R. V. margin).

    4. Political Relations.

          There were no great states built up in Canaan (the Hebrews are
          not here under discussion) except that of the [696]Hittites, who
          possessed a great kingdom in northern Syria. Apart from this
          only small states are mentioned. The Amarna tablets make known a
          number of these as at war with each other and as accused of
          unfaithfulness to the Pharaohs Amenophis III. and IV. Egyptian
          overlordship was maintained more or less completely 1500-1200
          B.C. The sons of the local kings were sent to Egypt for their
          education, and their enthronement when they succeeded to power
          was the deed of the Pharaoh. The topography of the country, cut
          up by mountain ranges with intervening valleys and wadis, is not
          favorable to the formation and maintaining of great states; even
          those of Damascus and of Israel were not long-lived.

    5. The Earlier Inhabitants.

          According to the representation in Gen. x. 18b, the Canaanites
          had spread from the central part toward the south. This can not
          be proved, but the course of subsequent historical movements
          makes it probable. The custom of E in using "Amorites" to
          connote the inhabitants of the land and the known course of the
          progress of this people is one of these indications. Only faint
          recollections of the primitive dwellers are preserved in the Old
          Testament, in such passages as Deut. ii. 10-11; II Sam. xxi. 16,
          18, 20, 22, where they appear as "giants," a mythical term (cf.
          Amos ii. 9). From them the Plain of Rephaim west of Jerusalem
          received its name. In the passages from Samuel quoted above
          Raphah, "the Giant," is named as their ancestor. Deut. ii. 11
          reckons the Anakim as belonging to them, and Num. xiii. 33 is an
          expression of their physical stature; their chief town is named
          as Kirjath-arba, the latter part of which name is explained as
          the name of the ancestor and the greatest of the Anakim (Josh.
          xiv. 15, xv. 13).

    6. Peoples Mentioned in the Bible.

          The Old Testament employs the term Canaanites not only in the
          sense explained in the foregoing as the common name of the
          inhabitants of Canaan, but also in an ethnographical sense of
          one of the stocks included. But from the preceding discussion
          the doubt is raised whether this usage is original or has
          ethnological worth. For decision of this question it is
          important to note that the Canaanites are mentioned among other
          peoples of Canaan when the author wishes to note a great number
          of peoples whom the Hebrews had subdued. In this case a settled
          form was employed with an alternative form. The common form was
          "Canaanite, Hittite, Amorite, Perizzite, Hivite, and Jebusite"
          (in eleven passages), in which the intention is clear to place
          the more important peoples first in the arrangement. The
          alternative form is "Amorite, Perizzite, Canaanite, Hittite,
          Girgashite, Hivite, and Jebusite" (Josh. xxiv. 11). This last is
          varied by the insertion of Kenites, Kenizzites, and Kadmonites
          (Gen. xv. 19-21), or by the omission of one or more from the
          list (for Kenites see [697]Cain, Kenites; for Kenizzites see
          [698]Caleb, Calebites, and see also [699]Amorites and
          [700]Jebus, Jebusites).

    7. The Hittites.

          The Hittites have become more familiar through the decipherment
          of the hieroglyphs and cuneiform inscriptions than through the
          Old Testament. Thothmes III. (c. 1500 B.C.) first came into
          contact with them in the district later known as Commagene on
          the northern boundary of Syria. A hundred years later they were
          in possession of a kingdom which stretched from the Euphrates to
          the middle Orontes, including Hamath within its bounds. Rameses
          II. (c. 1300-1230 B.C.) waged a long war with them, and in the
          twenty-first year of his reign made a treaty in which a
          demarcation of the boundaries of their respective realms was
          agreed upon. About 1200 B.C. this kingdom fell apart into a
          number of small states. In the ninth and eighth centuries the
          Assyrians mention a small Hittite kingdom encountered in their
          campaigns, that of Carchemish on the Euphrates. They also use
          the phrase "land of the Hittites" to denote the region between
          the Euphrates and the Taurus range and south as far as
          Palestine. But this can not be held to prove that the Hittite
          power extended so far. They left numerous inscriptions, in the
          attempt to decipher which P. Jensen is particularly engaged, and
          he thinks he can discover in the Hittites the forerunners of the
          Armenians. The Egyptians call the Hittites H?ata, the Assyrians
          call them H?atti. Old Testament passages locate them in North
          Syria in close connection with the Arameans (I Kings x. 29) and
          II Kings vii. 6 associates them with the Syrian kingdom of
          Muz?ri (according to Winckler, misread "Egypt," see
          [701]Assyria, VI., 2, 3, § 7). And the Table of Nations in Gen.
          x. 15 with its context leaves no doubt that the intention was to
          locate them in North Syria. The Hittites in the service of David
          (I Sam. xxvi. 6; II Sam. xi. 3) were probably soldiers of
          fortune who had come south. Some few Old Testament passages
          coincide with the late Assyrian usage and speak of the land far
          south as Hittite. See [702]Hittites.

    8. The Hivites

          The Hivites are associated with the Amorites in the LXX. text of
          Isa. xvii. 9 (cf. R. V. margin), but, apart from the stereotyped
          formulas mentioned above, seldom appear in Scripture. II Sam.
          xxiv. 7 locates them among the Canaanites dwelling south of
          Tyre. According to Judges iii. 3, cf. Josh. xi. 3, their country
          was in Lebanon between "Baal-hermon and the entering in of
          Hamath." Josh. xi. 3 is not in accord with II Sam. xxiv. 7, and
          it does not lighten the difficulty to substitute Hittites for
          Hivites.

    9. The Horites.

          The Horites according to Gen. xxxvi. 30 inhabited Mt. Seir, that
          is the district east and west of the valley (the wadi Arabah)
          south of the Dead Sea. They were destroyed by the Edomites
          (Deut. ii. 12, 22). Gen. xxxvi. 20-30 counts seven branches of
          the Horites. Gen. xiv. 6 assigns to them the mountain east of
          the wadi Arabah. Nowadays the custom prevails to connect them
          with the people named Haru by the Egyptians, who mean by it
          South Palestine.

    10. The Perizzites.

          The Perizzites are seldom mentioned except in the stereotyped
          formulas; in three J passages, Gen. xiii. 7, xxxiv. 30; Judges
          i. 4, they are associated with the Canaanites, and in Josh.
          xvii. 15 with the Rephaim, "Giants." The last passage would make
          of them pre-Canaanites, for which the J passages give no
          occasion, but locate them about Bethel, Shechem, and Bezek,
          within the boundaries of the Joseph territory.

    11. The Geshurites.

          The Geshurites are in Deut. iii. 14; Josh. xii. 5, xiii. 11, 13
          placed in the Aramaic district of Geshur, in the northern part
          of the Jaulan east of the Jordan; but Josh. xiii. 2 and I Sam.
          xxvii. 8 locate them in southern Philistia. Since Wellhausen,
          the last passage has been made to read "Gezerites" instead. But
          it must be concluded that the name Geshurites was applied to
          nomads in southern Palestine. Besides the foregoing there appear
          the Girgashites (Gen. x. 16, etc.), to be connected, perhaps,
          with names known to be Phenician; the Avvim (Deut. ii. 23; Josh.
          xiii. 3), whose residence was south of Gaza; and the Kadmonites
          (Gen. xv. 19), of whom nothing is known.

    12. The Conquest by the Hebrews.

          The conquest of Canaan by the Hebrews was rendered easy by
          several circumstances. The overlordship of the Egyptians became
          about 1250 B.C. a mere name. Moreover, about 1400 B.C.,
          according to the [703]Amarna Tablets, a people called the Habiri
          had crossed the Jordan westward, partly because the chiefs there
          were employing them as soldiers and partly to better their lot.
          These, related to the Israelites, were indeed their predecessors
          along the same route, who by establishing themselves gave the
          invitation to others to settle there. But the light-armed
          Israelites, who established themselves in the more open country,
          had a more difficult task against the Canaanites armed with iron
          weapons and chariots of the same material. The assault of the
          Hebrews was not made with their united force and at one time, as
          the narrative in Joshua asserts, but in two divisions, and not
          at the same time. The first attack was made by Simeon, Levi, and
          Judah, the second by the Joseph tribes under the leadership of
          Joshua (Judges i. 1-3, 22). A series of victories, reported in
          Josh. ii.-x., made it possible for the Joseph tribes to settle
          between Bethel and the Plain of Jezreel. According to the first
          part of Joshua, the Hebrews put the ban on the Canaanites, i.e.,
          exterminated them. But this does not agree with other
          statements. While indeed those foes were perhaps exterminated
          who were taken in actual contest, the universal application of
          the ban does not accord with many other passages of Scripture.
          The Canaanites were pressed back; progress in possession was
          made partly by subjecting the earlier inhabitants, partly by
          peaceful means. In the former case the Canaanites became slaves;
          in the latter, union of stocks was brought about. The victory at
          Taanach under Deborah and Barak assured to the Hebrews the
          control of the Plain of Jezreel. The northern districts of
          Naphtali and Asher retained their non-Israelitic population (see
          [704]Galilee). The southern stock of Judah in time allied itself
          with many peoples of alien race (see [705]Caleb, Calebites, and
          cf. Gen. xxxviii.). The remainder of the non-Hebraic population
          was put to service by Solomon.

          It is this reduction of the Canaanites to servitude which is at
          the basis of the narrative in Gen. ix. 20-27, which deals with
          Noah and his three sons. Wellhausen has made it plain that in
          ix. 22 the words "Ham the father of" are an intrusion by the
          editor to bring the section into harmony with its context.
          Canaan is the younger brother who is there subjected to his
          brethren. Shem no doubt, in the passage, means Israel, and
          Japhet the Phenicians, and Shem and Japhet are both ruling
          peoples. Canaan's position in the [706]Table of Nations is quite
          other than that in Gen. ix. 20-27.

   Canada
          CANADA: A country of North America occupying the entire
          continent north of the United States except Alaska; area,
          3,745,574 square miles; population (1901), 5,371,315 (estimated
          in 1909 at 6,100,000).

    Political Divisions and Government.

          The Dominion of Canada, the official designation of the country,
          was formed in 1867 by a confederation of the eastern provinces
          of Upper and Lower Canada (now Ontario and Quebec), New
          Brunswick, and Nova Scotia, the coalition being recognized by an
          Act of Parliament of the mother country. A governor-general,
          appointed by the king of England, and a privy council administer
          the government. The legislative power is a parliament consisting
          of a senate, whose members are appointed for life by the crown
          on nomination of the ministry, and a house of commons elected
          every five years at the longest. The Dominion now comprises, in
          addition to the provinces already named, Manitoba (admitted
          1870), British Columbia (1871), Prince Edward Island (1873),
          Alberta (1905), Saskatchewan (1905), and the Northwest
          Territories comprising the districts of Assiniboia, Athabasca,
          Keewatin, Yukon, Mackenzie, Ungava, and Franklin. Each province
          has its own "lieutenant-governor," executive council, and
          legislative assembly. Nearly three-quarters of the entire
          population is in the two provinces of Ontario and Quebec, and
          almost ninety per cent in the five eastern provinces. The
          increase during the last decade was a little more than eleven
          per cent. There is no State Church, but the Roman Catholics of
          Quebec are guaranteed the privileges which they enjoyed previous
          to the English occupation.

    History and Statistics.

          The Frenchman Jacques Cartier took possession of the Labrador
          region in the name of his king in 1534, and in 1535-36 he
          ascended the St. Lawrence as far as Montreal. The first
          permanent settlement was at Quebec in 1608 under the lead of
          Champlain. The gain in French colonists was slow, and the stream
          flowed westward toward the Mississippi. English conquest and the
          peace of 1763 brought Canada under English control. The English
          and Protestant inhabitants were considerably increased by
          immigration of English loyalists from the United States after
          1783, and the Roman Catholics received a large increment during
          the nineteenth century by immigration from Ireland; the French
          population also was augmented after 1871 by a noteworthy number
          of Alsatians.

          The following is the table of religious statistics from the
          census of 1901:

          The Roman Catholics constitute 41.5 per cent of the entire
          population. They are most numerous in Quebec (1,429,260; 86.7
          per cent of the population of the province); in Ontario their
          number is 390,304 (1.8 per cent). The total number of
          Protestants is about 3,000,000 (56.2 per cent). Nearly all of
          the Buddhists and Confucians are in British Columbia, whither
          they have come as a result of the active trade with eastern
          Asia. The adherents of the Greek Church are mostly immigrants
          from Russia to Manitoba, Alberta, and Assiniboia; the
          [707]Dukhobors, who may be regarded as a schismatic branch of
          this Church, are in Assiniboia and Saskatchewan. Of the Jews
          almost half (7,498) are in Quebec and 5,321 in Ontario. Nearly
          all the Mormons are in Ontario (3,377) and Alberta (3,212). Of
          the Mennonites, 15,246 are in Manitoba, 12,208 in Ontario, and
          3,683 in Saskatchewan. The "pagans" are the Eskimos and
          unconverted Indians; according to some authorities their number
          is much larger than that given by the census. All the large
          denominations are actively engaged in missionary work in the
          wide domain of Canada, operating through permanent stations and
          itinerant missionaries. The Roman Catholic Church has from the
          first been particularly successful in this work, and the
          majority of the Indians converted to Christianity belong to this
          Church. The "various sects" are 110 in number and include
          seventy-nine which reported less than ten members each.

    The Roman Catholic Church.

          The Roman Catholic Church in Canada dates from the discovery.
          Huguenots were allowed to settle, only on conditions that soon
          proved fatal to their religion. In 1615 three Recollect priests
          settled in Quebec, forming the earliest regular establishment.
          In 1625 the Jesuits arrived, and began their missionary and
          educational labors. In 1657 [708]François Xavier de
          Laval-Montmorency was named vicar apostolic of New France,
          becoming first bishop of Quebec in 1674. Under him the church
          system was fully organized. For some time after the conquest,
          the see of Quebec remained vacant, as the English Government
          would recognize its occupant only as the head of the Roman
          Church in Canada, and not as the bishop of that city. The
          difficulty was, however, overcome. In 1819 Joseph Octave Plessis
          (bishop of Quebec from 1806) became the first Canadian
          archbishop.

          As organized at present the Roman Catholic Church of Canada has
          an apostolic delegate (first appointed by Leo XIII.), who
          resides at Ottawa. There are eight provinces, twenty dioceses,
          and four vicariates apostolic, as follows:

          Province of Halifax (Nova Scotia, Prince Edward Island, and New
          Brunswick; the Bermuda Islands also form a part of the

          for men and thirty-five for women, the larger number of which
          are actively engaged in missionary and charitable work. Laval
          University was founded at Quebec in 1852 and has faculties of
          theology, law, medicine, and arts.

    The Anglican Church.

          The Anglican Church in Canada dates from its conquest by
          England. The first congregation was organized in Montreal in
          1766, service being held in the chapel of the Recollects at such
          hours as the building was not required for mass. In 1774, while
          the Roman Catholic Church was secured in all its previous
          rights, it was restricted to collecting its church-dues from
          members of its own communion, and the purpose was intimated of
          establishing a Protestant Church. In 1791, when Canada first
          received a constitution, one-seventh of all the land in the
          colony disposed of by sale or grant to colonists was "reserved"
          for the support of a Protestant clergy. In 1787 Charles Inglis
          was appointed by the English Crown bishop of Nova Scotia--the
          first of the colonial bishops; in 1793 Jacob Mountain was
          appointed bishop of Quebec. The present organization includes
          two provinces and twenty-three bishoprics, as follows:

          Province of Canada (the Maritime Provinces, Quebec, and
          Ontario); archdiocese, Montreal (founded 1850; archdiocese,
          1901; since 1904 the archbishop has borne the title primate of
          all Canada); dioceses, Algoma (with the bishop's seat at Sault
          Ste. Marie, 1873), Fredericton (1845), Huron (London, 1857),
          Niagara (Hamilton, 1875), Nova Scotia (Halifax, 1787), Ontario
          (Kingston, 1861), Ottawa (1896), Quebec (1793), Toronto (1839).

          Province of Rupert's Land (the territory west of Ontario and
          south and east of Hudson Bay); archdiocese, Rupert's Land (1849;
          archdiocese, 1893; the cathedral is at Winnipeg): dioceses,
          Athabasca (1884), Calgary (1888). Keewatin (1901), Mackenzie
          River (1874), Moosonee (1872), Qu'Appelle (1884), Saskatchewan
          (1874), Selkirk (1891).

          Dioceses not forming part of any province: Caledonia (1879),
          Columbia 1859) Kootenai (1901), New Westminster (1879).

          There are theological schools at Lennoxville, Que., Montreal,
          Toronto, and Winnipeg.

          For the history and information about other religious bodies of
          Canada, see the articles on the different denominations.

    Education.

          Canada has a good system of public instruction, each province
          managing its own affairs without centralized system for the
          entire dominion. Elementary schools, high schools or collegiate
          institutes, and normal schools lead up to the university, and a
          good education is within the reach of all. The expenses are met
          by government grants, local assessments, and school fees. Roman
          Catholic schools are entitled to a share in the public
          educational funds by the agreement of 1763, and the religious
          question has led to complications in home localities. In Quebec
          there are two distinct boards of school commissioners,
          Protestant and Roman Catholic, each having its portion of the
          public funds and managing its schools as it sees fit. In
          Manitoba there are no separate schools, but religious
          instruction may be given in the school buildings by Protestant
          or Catholic teachers.

   Candidus (Weiss), Pantaleon
          CANDIDUS, c??n-dî´dus (WEISS), PANTALEON: Reformed theologian;
          b. at Ybbs (60 m. w. of Vienna), Austria, Oct. 7, 1540; d. at
          Zweibrücken (55 m. n.w. of Carlsruhe), in the Palatinate, Feb.
          3, 1608. He was sent in his tenth year to Andreas Cupicius,
          Evangelical preacher at Weissenkirchen, for instruction. When
          his teacher was persecuted by the Jesuits on account of his
          faith and thrown into prison, Candidus attended him as famulus
          and fled with him to Hungary. Returning to his native land, he
          continued his studies with the aid of Vitus Nuber, abbot of
          Säussenstein (near Ybbs), and when he also was persecuted,
          Candidus accompanied him to Duke Wolfgang of Zweibrücken. He
          received a scholarship from the duke which enabled him to
          acquire a thorough humanistic and theological education at the
          University of Wittenberg, where he spent about seven years from
          1558; he became amanuensis of Hubert Languet and was on intimate
          terms with Melanchthon. In 1565 he left Wittenberg, and, after
          having taught a short time in the Latin school of Zweibrücken,
          became pastor at Hinzweiler, then deacon at Weisenheim and
          Zweibrücken, and in 1571 town preacher and general
          superintendent in Zweibrücken.

          The Church of Zweibrücken had been founded by Johannes Schweblin
          in accordance with the Lutheran doctrine by the acceptance of
          the Augsburg Confession and the [710]Wittenberg Concord of 1536.
          Duke Wolfgang, after the death of Melanchthon, took vigorous
          measures against the Philippists and Calvinists by employing
          strict Lutherans like Marbach, Andreä, and Hesshus. His son,
          John I., continued the same policy, and the most influential
          positions were filled with trustworthy Lutherans such as Jacob
          Heilbrunner and Jacob Schopper. But a change of conditions was
          brought about under the influence of the Count Palatine John
          Casimir, who sent his cousin John a statement of the conflicting
          opinions of Reformed princes and theologians. Thereupon the
          latter demanded in 1578 a general convention for the discussion
          of these questions. Candidus, who had always leaned toward
          Calvinism, became now one of the most influential advocates of
          the Reformed cause, and the duke himself openly confessed the
          Calvinistic doctrine, although he had signed the Formula of
          Concord. The remonstrances of the Lutheran electoral princes
          were of no avail, nor was a Lutheran embassy which was sent in
          1580, consisting of men like Marbach and Osiander. Candidus
          accepted the Reformed Christology and the Calvinistic doctrine
          of the Lord's Supper, and in 1585 edited a catechism which
          contributed considerably to the eradication of the Lutheran
          doctrine. Moreover, he entered into negotiations with the
          Reformed theologians of Heidelberg and completed the work of
          Calvinism in 1588 by his Christliche und notwendige Erklärung
          des Catechismi aus Gottes Wort, etc., which in its wording and
          sense follows closely the Heidelberg catechism. The Reformed
          Church service was introduced in the same way. The dissensions
          were renewed in 1593 at the religious colloquy of Neuburg, where
          the Zweibrücken theologians protested against any innovations
          and attempted to show their agreement with the Augustana. Since
          the beginning of the seventeenth century the Church of
          Zweibrücken has been counted among the Reformed Churches.
          Candidus was also active in the literary field and has left
          twenty works, written mostly in Latin. He was especially
          prolific in Latin poetical productions and handled the elegiac
          measure with ability.

          CANDLER, WARREN AKIN: Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
          South; b. near Villa Rica, Ga., Aug. 23, 1857. He was educated
          at Emory College, Oxford, Ga. (B.A., 1875), and entered the
          North Georgia Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church,
          South, in 1875, holding various pastorates until 1886. From the
          latter year until 1888 he was editor of the Christian Advocate,
          Nashville, Tenn., the official organ of his denomination, and
          from 1888 to 1898 was president of Emory College. Since 1898 he
          has been a bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church, South. In
          theology he is a Wesleyan Arminian. He has written: History of
          Sunday Schools (New York, 1880); Georgia's Educational Work
          (Atlanta, Ga., 1893); Christus Auctor (Nashville, Tenn., 1900);

   Candlish, Robert Smith
          CANDLISH, ROBERT SMITH: One of the founders and a leader of the
          Free Church of Scotland; b. in Edinburgh Mar. 23, 1806; d. there
          Oct. 19, 1873. He studied at Glasgow (M.A., 1823), and at the
          divinity hall 1823-26; was licensed in 1828 and served as
          assistant of St. Andrews, Glasgow, and of Bonhill,
          Dumbartonshire; in 1834 he became minister of St. George's,
          Edinburgh, where his talent as a preacher soon made him famous.
          In 1839 he publicly identified himself with the party in the
          Church of Scotland which afterward became the Free Church, and
          in all the public proceedings prior to the disruption in 1843,
          especially in the debates in the General Assembly, took a
          leading part; after the disruption he was foremost in organizing
          and developing the Free Church. His eloquence in debate, his
          business tact, and his high character enabled him to retain the
          high position he had gained in spite of a somewhat sharp and
          abrupt manner, and a tendency to what some considered diplomatic
          management. On the death of Dr. Chalmers in 1847 he was
          appointed to succeed him as professor of divinity in New
          College, Edinburgh, but declined the appointment, preferring to
          continue minister of St. George's; in 1862, however, he became
          principal of New College, the duties involving little labor. He
          was the chief organizer and extender of the school system of the
          Free Church, which was afterward incorporated with the national
          system of education; and one of the founders of the Evangelical
          Alliance in 1845. He was a voluminous author, although his books
          did not attain a very large circulation; among his writings
          were: Contributions Towards the Exposition of the Book of
          Genesis (3 vols., Edinburgh, 1843-62; rev. ed., 2 vols., 1868);
          Scripture Characters and Miscellanies (London, 1850);
          Examination of Mr. Maurice's Theological Essays (1854); Life in
          a Risen Saviour, discourses on I Cor. xv. (Edinburgh, 1858); The
          Two Great Commandments, sermons on Romans xii. (London, 1860);
          The Atonement, its Reality, Completeness, and Extent (1861); The
          Fatherhood of God, the first course of Cunningham lectures at
          New College, Edinburgh, 1864 (5th ed. enlarged, 2 vols.,
          Edinburgh, 1890); The First Epistle of John Expounded in a
          Series of Lectures (1866); Discourses Bearing upon the Sonship
          and Brotherhood of Believers (1872); Sermons, with memoir
          (1873); and The Gospel of Forgiveness, a series of discourses
          (1878).

   Canisius, Petrus (Peter Kanis, Canis, Canijs)
          CANISIUS, c??-nî´si-us or c?-nî´shUs, PETRUS (Peter Kanis,
          Canis, Canijs): A Jesuit to whom the order owes its spread in
          Germany; b. at Nymwegen, in the Netherlands, May 8, 1521; d. at
          Freiburg, Switzerland, Dec. 21, 1597. He studied at Cologne from
          1535 to 1544 and obtained the degrees of bachelor of theology,
          licentiate of arts, and master of arts (i.e., doctor of
          philosophy). In 1543 be went to the [714]Jesuit Pierre Favre at
          Mainz, made the "spiritual exercises" (see [715]Jesuits) under
          his guidance, and entered the order as a novice. With nine
          like-minded companions he founded secretly at Cologne the first
          Jesuit colony, but the city council dissolved the body, though
          at the intercession of the university the members were permitted
          to remain in the city, as individuals. In 1545 Canisius began
          his lectures, preached, and prepared an edition of the works of
          Cyril of Alexandria, with a Latin translation, the first volume
          of which was published at Cologne in 1546. In the mean time, the
          fervent orator, who had agitated especially against the
          archbishop Hermann of Wied, who inclined toward Protestantism,
          had obtained such authority among the strictly Catholic party
          that at the beginning of the Schmalkald War it delegated him as
          mediator to the imperial camp at Ulm. Here he came into close
          relations with Cardinal Otto Truchsess, bishop of Augsburg, who
          was destined to open the way for him into Bavaria and insure the
          activity of his order. Ignatius Loyola perceived the talent of
          Canisius, and, to perfect him in the spirit and nature of the
          order and make him a chosen vessel, called the young man to Rome
          and employed him for two yearn in Italy at Messina. Upon his
          return, Canisius commenced his work in Bavaria in 1549, in 1552
          at Vienna and in the Austrian territories, in 1555 at Prague
          with the two objects in view, to permeate the German Catholics
          with the Jesuitic spirit of piety, and to repel Protestantism.
          At Vienna he composed the Summa doctrinæ Christianæ, the
          "catechism," which an imperial edict soon introduced into all
          Austria; in four hundred editions published during 130 years, it
          proved an excellent means of mental training (Eng. transl.,
          Paris, 1588). His other literary productions include two volumes
          (De Johanne Baptista, Dillingen, 1571, and De Maria Virgine,
          Ingolstadt, 1577), written against the "pestilentissimum opus,"
          the [716]Magdeburg Centuries. But his literary activity against
          Protestantism was unimportant compared with what he accomplished
          as teacher in Vienna, Dillingen, and Ingolstadt, as adviser of
          Catholic princes, and as preacher and pastor of very large
          circles. Besides the colleges already mentioned, the order owes
          to him the establishment of the important colleges of Augsburg,
          Munich, and Innsbruck, and its spread to Poland. When at the
          height of his successes he attended the Council of Trent in
          1562. And yet in the long run he did not retain the confidence
          of the leaders of his order. The general stopped him when he was
          on the point of preparing a third volume for the refutation of
          the "Centuries" (De potestate Petri et successorum). His last
          achievement was the founding of a new college at Freiburg in
          Switzerland.

   Cano (Canus), Melchior
          CANO, c??´nO (Canus), MELCHIOR: A scholastic Dominican of the
          University of Alcala; b. at Tarancón (38 m. w. of Cuenca), Spain
          [Jan. 1, 1509; d. at Toledo Sept. 30, 1560]. He took part in the
          deliberations of the Council of Trent, especially in those
          concerning the doctrine of the Eucharist, opposing the efforts
          made at the instance of the emperor Ferdinand that the cup
          should be given to the laity. Having returned from Trent, Philip
          II. made him bishop of the Canaries, without residence there, as
          he became provincial of his order in Castile. His principal
          works are: Prælectiones de poenitentia and De sacramentis (both
          Salamanca, 1550), and his Loci theologici (1563), consisting of
          twelve books about the sources whence doctrinal proofs may be
          derived; the "authoritas" has its place before the "ratio," and
          the principal source is of course tradition. Although an
          opponent of the Jesuits, Cano was a thoroughgoing papal
          theologian, and he was a scholastic, although he opposed "false"
          scholasticism. For his opposition to the Jesuits he had to
          suffer denunciations which caused his citation to Rome in 1556
          as "perditionis filius, Melchior Canus, diabolicis motus
          suasionibus, non erubuit prædicare, antichristum venisse." By
          the exertions of the Spanish government the citation was not
          headed. But the Loci theologici were placed on the Lisbon index
          in 1624, and were much altered by the expurgator.

   Canon
          CANON: A word used in a variety of senses in ecclesiastical
          terminology, all more or less related to the primary meaning of
          the Greek word kanOn, "a straight rod or bar, rule, standard."
          (1) The decisive list of the books considered as forming part of
          the Holy Scriptures (see [717]Canon of Scripture). (2) In
          ancient usage, any official church list, as of those who were to
          be commemorated in the liturgy, whence the term canonization, or
          of the clergy attached to a certain church, whence (3) A member
          of a body of clergy living together under a more or less
          definite rule in connection with a cathedral or collegiate
          church or in a quasimonastic organization as canons regular (see
          [718]Chapter; [719]Augustinians; [720]Premonstratensians). (4)
          The decree or decision of a council for the regulation of
          doctrine or discipline (see [721]Canon Law). (5) The fixed, most
          important portion of the mass, from the Sanctus to the Pater
          noster. (6) In the hymnology of the Eastern Church, an important
          class of long and elaborate hymns usually sung in the morning
          office, founded mainly on the Old Testament canticles then used,
          and composed of either eight or nine odes.

   Canoness
          CANONESS: A member of a company of women under the rule of an
          abbess and bound by vows of celibacy and obedience, but not by
          one of poverty. Some canonesses were "secular," and the houses
          they lived in were homes for ladies of the nobility; but others
          were "religious" and lived in nunneries of the Benedictine or
          Augustinian order. Few of these establishments survived the
          Reformation, and their inmates generally became Protestants.
          Some of the houses became Protestant homes fur noble ladies, as
          those at Gandersheim, Herford, and Quedlinburg in Germany.

          Canon law is the sum total of the legal enactments of the
          Church.

I. Definition and General Discussion.

          In modern times the differences between various Christian
          Churches have brought about a variance of law, since it springs
          in the first instance from the development of the ecclesiastical
          consciousness; and it is thus possible to speak of Roman
          Catholic and Protestant canon law. While the expression is most
          commonly used in connection with the former, it is not quite
          coextensive or identical with the law of the Roman Catholic
          Church, but designates rather the content of the Corpus juris
          canonici (see below, [722]II., 7), in contrast with the newer
          regulations based on the decisions of the Council of Trent, the
          concordats and bulls of circumscription of the nineteenth
          century, and the Vatican Council. These have in many particulars
          modified or superseded the older law, until a new codification
          of the whole mass of enactments has become necessary, and is now
          contemplated under the direction of Pope Pius X.

          The canon law, in the sense thus assigned to the term, contains
          a large number of regulations pertaining to matters which,
          according to modern constitutions, have been withdrawn from
          ecclesiastical jurisdiction and placed under the ordinary
          secular tribunals. These provisions have thus ceased to be
          operative. They include the relations between Church and State,
          the legal status of heretics, ecclesiastical jurisdiction, etc.
          The Roman Catholic Church, it is true, still maintains in theory
          the permanent validity of these enactments, and claims the same
          preeminent power and independence of the State as it possessed
          in the Middle Ages. Since the Reformation and the upbuilding of
          modern nationalities, however, the principle of the unity of
          jurisdiction and the authority of the law has proved
          irreconcilable with these claims. The freedom and independence
          conceded to the Church in the ordering of its own internal
          affairs by no means involves the absolute supremacy and validity
          of the canon law when it comes into conflict with the civil law,
          or releases the ecclesiastical authorities from their
          responsibility and their obedience to the State; for the freedom
          of the Church, like all other freedom in the modern world, is a
          freedom within the bounds of the law. But while the Roman
          Catholic Church appeals to divine mission and inalienable rights
          in support of its protest against these limitations, and has
          occasionally provoked serious conflicts by insistence upon its
          position in this matter, Protestantism from the very start tools
          a much more restricted view of the extent of ecclesiastical
          operations and of the authority of its own law, sometimes, where
          it is established, working directly with the State, but always
          submitting without question to civil ordinances. The difference
          is seen again in the fact that while Roman Catholicism
          recognizes only one Church, and thus only one valid church law,
          Protestantism, though holding its own interpretation of the
          Christian faith for the true one, does not claim exclusive
          jurisdiction over all creatures, and concedes to the various
          bodies which it conceives as forming an invisible unity the
          right to their own independent action in matters of legislation.

          Canon law, the outcome of the Church's development, rests upon
          positive enactment, and the attempt to construct a natural
          ecclesiastical law on rational principles must necessarily fail,
          setting as it does arbitrary and subjective views in place of
          the positive data of church history. A philosophical treatment
          of church law is, on the other hand, of great importance. It
          grasps in their entirety the fundamental principles on which as
          a basis the actual development has taken place, correlates them
          with the objective conceptions and principles of the Church
          itself, and in this way discovers not only the errors and
          deviations but the inevitable tendencies and direction of the
          development. In modern times, since the delimitation of the
          boundary between Church and State, doubt has been cast upon the
          independence of the church law, as if there could be no law
          without the action of the State, and what passed for law outside
          this action was only an ethical standard, not a juridical. The
          law of the State, however, in its essence, is a product not so
          much of the State as of the national consciousness of what is
          just, and really precedes rather than follows the operation of
          the State; its standards do not have to wait for sanction until
          the State declares its readiness to enforce them by pains and
          penalties. The Church as a distinct moral order is qualified to
          regulate and develop its own internal functions and institutions
          of its own motion. It is true that until recently Protestant
          churches have to a large extent been organized, especially in
          England and Germany, by secular legislation; but this state of
          things is really an anomalous one, not corresponding to the
          essential idea and meaning of the Church. The result of the
          modern settlement has been in most cases to leave the Church
          free to develop independently its own system, without the need
          of any special permission or privilege from the State in order
          to give such regulations the force of law within the Church. Its
          members realize that they are bound to the fulfilment of such
          ordinances because they have come into being in a regular and
          legal manner, and so long as they are not repealed in the same
          manner. This obligation is not a mere matter of conscience, but
          rests on a basis of positive law, because the standards of
          action imposed by it are the expression of the will of the
          Church in its corporate capacity. Nor does the Church lack means
          to enforce obedience by the withdrawal of blessings which it
          alone is empowered to impart and equally empowered to withhold.
          According to the Protestant conception, it is true the binding
          force of ecclesiastical regulations is to a great extent
          dependent upon the will of the individual to be and remain a
          member of the church fellowship.

II. Collections of Canons and Decretals.

  1. Early History.

          In the first three centuries the term canon was applied to the
          standard of right living accepted in the Church, resting partly
          on written and partly on oral tradition. When the synods,
          especially the general ones, became the main agents in the
          development of church life, their decisions on points of
          practise were also known as canons--though this name was not
          usually applied to the decrees of local synods until the sixth
          century, after their inclusion in the great and widely
          circulated collections had given them a status and an authority
          in a measure analogous to those of the ecumenical councils. With
          the development of the primatial power of the pope, the name
          came at the beginning of the ninth century to be applied also to
          his decrees, and finally its use was extended in medieval
          terminology to any ecclesiastical enactment. The collections of
          canons were made up at first of the decrees of councils and of
          popes; later collections include, in addition to these, excerpts
          from the Fathers, from letters and regulations of bishops, from
          Scripture, and even from Roman law, Frankish capitularies, and
          ordinances of German emperors. The Council of Trent employed the
          word exclusively for dogmatic propositions couched in juridical
          form and followed by an anathema.

  2. First Codification.

          During the primitive age of the Church, when its constitution
          and discipline rested quite simply upon the precepts of Christ
          and the Apostles and the new problems which were later to make
          the Christian life more complicated had not yet come up, there
          was no need for a codification of the laws. It is hardly
          necessary to say that the so-called [723]Apostolic Constitutions
          and Canons are the product of a later age. The systematic
          formulation of law began with the closer organization of the
          Church and the holding of synods. The earliest mention of a
          Codex cannonum is found in the acts of the Council of Chalcedon
          (451), at which certain canons were read to the assembly from a
          collection. These, though numbered consecutively in the
          collection, can be identified as the sixth of Nicæa (325) and
          the fourth, fifth, sixteenth, and seventeenth of Antioch (332).
          This collection, accordingly, seems to have contained the canons
          of several councils, beginning with the twenty of Nicæa and
          possibly closing with those of Antioch, including between these
          twenty-five of Ancyra (314), fourteen of Neocæsarea (314), and
          twenty of Gangra (c. 365). There were undoubtedly other
          collections known in this period; one, which is still
          recognizable in the oldest Western Latin version, which omitted
          the canons of Antioch; others which included those of Laodicea
          (between 347 and 381), Constantinople (381), and Chalcedon
          (451); and still others which had also those of Sardica (347)
          and Ephesus (431). There is, however, no basis for the
          supposition that either the collection read from at the Council
          at Chalcedon or any other of these collections had an official
          character.

  3. Earliest Western Collections.

    1. The Quesnelliana.

          Of these Greek canons, only those of Nicæa were at first
          accepted in the West, and those of Sardica in the Latin
          original. As early as the fifth century, however, there were
          collections here also of Greek canons in a Latin version,
          through which the Eastern decrees gradually acquired authority.
          Of these three deserve special mention. (1) The Isidorian
          version, incorrectly so called because it is found in the great
          collection long ascribed to Isidore of Seville, is the oldest.
          It seems to have included originally only the canons comprised
          in the oldest Greek collection, to which those of Antioch,
          Laodicea, and Constantinople were added later. It was probably
          made in Italy; its date can not be determined, but its version
          of the Nicene canons was known in Gaul as early as 439. It was
          first published in 1675 by Paschasius Quesnell, from a
          manuscript at Oxford of a collection apparently made in Gaul at
          the end of the fifth century.

    2. The Prisca

          (2) The Versio prisca, made in Italy in the latter half of the
          fifth century, which contains the canons of Ancyra, Neocæsarea,
          Nicæa, Antioch, Gangra, Constantinople, and Chalcedon; frequent
          use was made of it for the completion of the Isidorian version
          and for other collections, especially Italian. It was first
          published by Justeau in the Bibliotheca juris canonici from an
          imperfect manuscript, then more fully and accurately by the
          Ballerini brothers.

    3. Collections of Dionysius.

          (3) That made by Dionysius Exiguus, probably in Rome at the end
          of the fifth century, and revised early in the sixth. It
          contains fifty "apostolic canons"; those of Nicæa, Ancrya,
          Neocæsarea, Gangra, Antioch, Laodicea, and Constantinople from a
          Greek collection; from another twenty-seven of Chalcedon in a
          new version; twenty-one of Sardica in the Latin original; and
          the acts of the Synod of Carthage (419). Somewhat later,
          probably under Pope Symmachus (498-514), Dionysius made another
          collection of all the decrees of popes known to him, including
          those of Siricius, Innocent I., Zosimus, Boniface I., Celestine
          I., Leo I., Gelasius I., and Anastasius II. Of a third
          collection made by order of Pope Hormisdas (514-523), and
          containing the originaltext of Greek canons with a Latin
          version, only the prologue is extant. The first two, however,
          combined into one, soon acquired preeminent consideration;
          Cassiodorus (d. 536) says that they were universally preferred
          in the Roman church of his time; they were used in Africa, the
          Frankish church, Spain, England, and Ireland. They were
          supplemented in course of time by the decretals of Hillary,
          Simplicius, Felix, Symmachus, Hormisdas, and Gregory II. A codex
          thus enlarged was presented by Adrian II. to Charlemagne in 744;
          this was taken, after the Capitulare ecclesiasticum of 789, as
          the basis of the Frankish capitularies, and probably sanctioned
          at the Synod of Aachen in 802 as the official code of the
          Frankish church.

  4. Next Period, by Countries.

    1. Africa.

          The canonical collections of the succeeding period may most
          conveniently be grouped under their respective countries. In
          Africa discipline rested primarily on the decrees of home
          councils, special weight being given to the Synod of Carthage in
          419, with whose acts those of the synods held under Aurelius
          from 393 were incorporated. These are the canons included,
          though imperfectly, in the collection of Dionysius; they were
          later translated into Greek and received into Oriental
          collections. Of other African collections only two require
          special mention--that made before 546 by Fulgentius Ferrandus, a
          Carthaginian deacon, under the name of Breviatio canonum,
          containing some of the Greek canons in the Isidorian version and
          African canons down to 523, and the Concordia canonum, compiled
          c. 690 (?) by Cresconius, possibly a bishop.

    2. Spain.

          Spain had its collections of canons and decretals in the sixth
          century, as is shown by the acts of the Council of Braga in 563
          and the Third of Toledo in 579. The enforcement of order and
          discipline required a completer codification, and a large
          collection seems to have been made at the Fourth Council of
          Toledo (633). By later additions it acquired the form in which
          it is now printed (Madrid, 1808). Its first or conciliar part
          contains the Greek canons found in the Isidorian version, those
          of Sardica, those of the Third Council of Constantinople (681),
          and two letters of Cyril under the name of the Council of
          Ephesus; nine African councils; sixteen Gallic councils, from
          314 to 549; and thirty-six Spanish, from 305 (?) to 694. In this
          last division, to the canons of the Second Council of Braga is
          appended a collection made by Martin, archbishop of Braga, a
          native of Pannonia (d. about 580), by free translation and
          selection of Greek, African, Gallic, and Spanish canons. The
          second part contains decretals of the popes from Damasus to
          Gregory I., including all that Dionysius had placed in his. The
          compiler of this great collection, usually cited as Hispana, is
          unknown. There is no evidence to show that Isidore of Seville
          had any direct hand in it; his name was first connected with it
          by the compiler of the False Decretals, who incorporated the
          older and genuine collection with them.

    3. British Isles.

          In the British Isles the Celtic church developed a disciplinary
          system of its own in synods of whose proceedings scarcely
          anything has been preserved. For certain fifth- and
          sixth-century canons of a penitential nature, see
          [724]Penitential Books. The Anglo-Saxon church in like manner
          relied for a long time on its own legislative resources, though
          the collection of Dionysius was known here in the seventh
          century. Except the penitential ordinances of Theodore, Bede,
          and Egbert, no Anglo-Saxon canons are extant. There is, however,
          an Irish collection of the seventh century or beginning of the
          eighth, compiled from Scripture, the Fathers, numerous Greek,
          African, Gallic, Spanish, and Irish synods, and papal decretals.
          The large number of Irish canons gives a specially interesting
          insight into the conditions of church life there.

    4. Frankish Empire.

          The Frankish empire, before the period mentioned above,
          possessed a number of collections of Greek, Gallic, and Spanish
          canons and papal decretals, which, however, need no detailed
          consideration. Besides the enlarged Dionysian collection, the
          Hispana was also known at the end of the eighth century, and was
          used to complete the Codex sent by Adrian. The large extent of
          this material and its lack of chronological arrangement soon
          brought about attempts at selection and systematic arrangement,
          which were frequent in the eighth and ninth centuries, and of
          which some deserve special mention. (1) A collection in 381
          chapters, sometimes found independently, sometimes as a fourth
          book to the canonical work erroneously ascribed to Archbishop
          Egbert of York. It dates from the end of the eighth century, and
          is important because of the use made of it by Regino (see below,
          [725]5) and of the help which it gives toward explaining a
          number of erroneous titles which passed over into this and the
          Decreta of Burchard and Gratian. (2) The Collectio Acheriana, so
          called from its first publisher d'Achéry, extant in numerous
          manuscripts and belonging to the end of the eighth or beginning
          of the ninth century. Its canons, divided into three books, are
          taken without exception from Adrian's edition of Dionysius and
          from the Hispana. (3) The Penitential of Halitgar of Cambrai,
          compiled between 817 and 831 at the request of Archbishop Ebbo
          of Reims. Of its five books the first two are taken from the
          writings of Gregory I. and Prosper of Aquitaine, while the
          larger part of the last three, as well as the prologue, come
          from the two collections just named, especially the second. All
          three of these collections are constructed with special regard
          to the penitential system of the time; and the same is true of
          the collections made by Rabanus Maurus, particularly the Liber
          poenitentium ad Otgarium of 841 and the Epistola ad Heribaldum
          of 853, the main purpose of which is to restore the ancient
          discipline by appeals to the writings of the Fathers and the old
          canons and decretals. A somewhat similar character is seen in
          the Capitula episcoporum, or small collections made by
          individual bishops, sometimes with the assent of diocesan
          synods, for the regulation of their own subjects, usually from
          larger works, but occasionally including their own edicts and
          the provisions of local law.

  5. Further Systematization.

          The great influence of the secular power on ecclesiastical
          action is the Carolingian period tended to add to the earlier
          church law a large amount of material, frequently covering
          matters of church discipline, is the capitularies of the
          Frankish kings. Efforts at systematization were soon called
          forth in this field also by practical needs. The first was that
          of Abbot Ansegis, which, however, as it contains nothing but
          capitularies, does not need further consideration here. It is
          different from the work which Benedict Levita of Mainz compiled
          in three books. Its purpose, according to him, was the
          completion of the work of Ansegis, but the imperial laws form
          only a small part of its contents, which are far more largely
          taken from the Bible, the Fathers, the ancient canons, with
          Roman statute and German common law. The special interest of
          this collection is the relation in which it stands, or has been
          thought to stand, to the [726]PseudoIsidorian Decretals.

    1. Forerunners of Gratian.

          Between the ninth and twelfth centuries a large number of
          compilations came into being, with the purpose of bringing the
          wealth of material scattered throughout the older works into
          practical relation with the more modern ecclesiastical
          principles. Unlike the smaller collections described above,
          which usually served rather local interests, these are as a rule
          of considerable size and sufficiently general to be used outside
          the limits of the diocese in which they originate. Some of them
          attained a wide currency and no little practical importance; but
          only a few of them need be mentioned for the purpose of this
          article. (1) The as yet unpublished Collectio Anselmo dedicata,
          taking its name from an Archbishop Anselm, probably Anselm II.
          of Milan (883-897). It is certainly Italian in origin; its
          material is taken partly from Adrian's edition of Dionysius
          enlarged by the addition of Carthaginian, Gallic, and Spanish
          councils from the Hispana, and partly from the False Decretals,
          the Registrum of Gregory I., two Roman synods under Zacharias
          (743) and Eugenius II. (826), the laws of Justinian, and the
          Novellæ of Julian--though probably this last part was
          interpolated afterward. It is important not only as being the
          first to make a thorough use of the code of Justinian, but as
          being the source of a large part of the Decretum of Burchard and
          through it of that of Gratian. (2) The Libri duo de causis
          synodalibus et disciplinis ecclesiasticis compiled by Regino,
          abbot of Prüm about 906, at the request of Rathbod, archbishop
          of Treves, to be by him and his representatives in the
          administration of the diocese. This work interesting as another
          source of Burchard's as well as for its immediate relation to
          the synodal courts and the practise of its time, was later
          enlarged, revised, and borrowed from in a whole series of
          similar collections. (3) The Decretum (Liber decretorum,
          Collectarium) of Bishop Burchard of Worms, compiled between 1012
          and 1023. The important material contained in its twenty books
          embraces the whole range of church discipline and order. A
          peculiarity of Burchard is that he frequently ascribes canons of
          councils and excerpts from Roman law, the capitularies, or
          penitential ordinances to one of the older popes or councils,
          evidently with the view of assuring their reception as
          authoritative--thus misleading later compilers, especially
          Gratian. (4) The Collectio duodecim partium, still unprinted;
          apparently made by a German very soon after the completion of
          Burchard's. Theiner, who was the first to call attention (in his
          Disquisitiones criticæ, Rome, 1836) to the importance of this
          collection, was under the erroneous impression that it was a
          source of Burchard's; but the relation is exactly the reverse.
          It contains, however, a number of interesting Frankish and
          German canons, some of them probably copied directly from the
          original documents. (5) The collection of Bishop Anselm of Lucca
          (d. 1086), which was incorporated almost bodily in the Decretutm
          Gratiani, and which contains a number of papal decretals not
          previously known, and probably taken from the Roman archives.
          (6) The collection of Cardinal Deusdedit, dedicated to Pope
          Victor III. (1086-87), in four books, of which the last deals
          with the freedom of the Church from secular interference, and
          thus introduces an element new to these collections. The ample
          use made of the Lateran archives gives a special interest to his
          collection, much of which is also in Gratian. (7) and (8) are
          two collections attributed to Bishop Ivo of Chartres (d.
          1117)--the Decretum in seventeen books and the Pannormia in
          eight. The relation of these two works has been the subject of
          much controversy; and if Ivo's authorship of the Pannormia, at
          one time often denied, is now considered certain, the Decretum,
          on the other hand, has been recently thought not to be his.
          Both, however, were abundantly drawn upon by Gratian, as was
          also, though not to the same extent, another unpublished
          collection (9), known under the name of Collectio trium partium.
          Its first part contains papal decretals down to Urban II. (d.
          1099) in chronological order, though not complete; the second,
          canons of councils, similarly arranged; the third, a separate
          collection of canons taken from the Decretum of Ivo. (10) A work
          frequently used by the Correctores Romani (see below, [727]7) is
          that compiled by a certain Cardinal Gregory in 1144, principally
          from the two collections Anselmi and Anselmo dedicata. It is
          usually cited as Polycarpus, from the designation given to it by
          the compiler himself in his preface, addressed to Bishop Didacus
          of Compostella.

    2. Gratian.

          These collections, from such diverse counties and periods, had
          many defects when it came to a question of practical use. There
          was no sort of general arrangement, but ecclesiastical and
          secular, universal and local law were inextricably mixed up;
          discrepancies and contradictions were numerous; many regulations
          had become obsolete, and been replaced in actual practise by
          others. There was great need for the compilation of a new work
          which should give a comprehensive survey of the law that was in
          force. This was undertaken by Gratian, a brother of the
          Camaldolite monastery of St. Felix at Bologna. Between 1139 and
          1142 he compiled a work entitled Concordantia discordantium
          canonum, though since the end of the twelfth century it has
          usually been known simply as the Decretum Gratiani. It is
          composed principally of the material found in (3) and (5) to
          (10) of the works named in the last section, and is divided into
          three parts. The first twenty "distinctions" in the first part
          contain propositions as to the sources of law, which Gratian
          designates as a treatise on decretals, followed by other
          treatises on qualifications for ordination, on ordination, and
          on ecclesiastical promotion. The second part, though other
          subjects occasionally come in, is mainly devoted to
          ecclesiastical jurisdiction, offenses, and legal proceedings,
          dealing in the last nine causæ with the law of matrimony, with a
          separate treatise on penance put into the thirty-third. The last
          part, entitled "Of consecration," deals with religious
          functions, and especially the sacraments, in five distinctions.
          The feature most characteristic of the work as a whole is that
          Gratian did not content himself with collecting canons to
          illustrate and enforce the principles to which they related and
          arranging them after a certain rather unsatisfactory system, but
          in the first two parts himself elucidated these principles in
          (generally short) explanations to which he appended the canons
          as pièces justificatives. In these dicta of his the attempt is
          frequently visible to reconcile or eliminate the discrepancies
          appearing in the canons as they stand.

          The extent to which the Decretum, in spite of all its defects,
          met a practical want of its day is seen by the approval and
          currency which it attained. The older collections were
          superseded by it; the work which Cardinal Laborans put together
          in 1182, containing much the same material with a really better
          arrangement, failed to attract attention. The wide popularity of
          Gratian's work is to be explained partly by the fact that it
          appeared at a time when Bologna was the headquarters for the
          study of law. The laborious activity of the glossators of the
          Roman law afforded a model for the application of the same
          learned method to Gratian's material. He himself lectured upon
          it, and thus became the founder of a new school of canonists
          who, in addition to their lectures, like the civil jurists,
          expounded separate passages of the Decretum by glosses or
          commentaries (see [728]Glosses and Glossators or Canon Law). In
          this way it became known far and wide; and its authority was
          further strengthened by the fact that the popes made use of it
          and cited it. It was never, indeed, expressly confirmed by any
          pope, or received in the Church as an official codex; but the
          influence of the university insured its respectful acceptance
          and its application in practise. It was not long before others,
          particularly a pupil of Gratian's named Paucapaleo, added canons
          here and there to make it more complete--at first in the form of
          marginal glosses, but later as a part of the text, with the
          designation Palea, which must have referred originally to the
          above-named scholar (though other interpretations have been
          attempted) and then have been adopted as a specific term for
          these additions. That they must early have crept into the text
          is shown by the fact that the majority of them are accepted in
          the work of Cardinal Laborans, a few years later.

  6. Collections of Decretals.

          Great as was the popularity and the practical importance which
          the Decretum acquired at the outset, it appeared, none the less,
          in a period characterized by great legislative activity on the
          part of the popes, who were now approaching the height of their
          power. The decretals issued from the twelfth century on
          contained an extraordinary wealth of new material for
          ecclesiastical law, which in many particulars altered and
          further developed the previous discipline of the Church; and
          thus it was not long before the work of Gratian, which, when it
          was compiled, represented practically the whole extant canon
          law, came inevitably to be regarded as antiquated or incomplete,
          and the need of new collections was felt. These, because they
          were composed almost wholly of papal decrees and the canons of
          councils held under the pope's eye, were usually known as
          collectiones decretalium.

    1. Before Gregory IX.

          Of such collections made before Gregory IX., five deserve
          special mention. (1) The Breviarium extravagantium, completed
          about 1191 by Bernard, dean of Pavia. The title comes from the
          fact that the laws included in it, principally new ones, were
          such as were not found in the Decretum, but, so to speak,
          wandered about homeless (extra Decretum vagantes). Bernard took
          his material partly from some older collections, of which he
          names explicitly the Corpus canonum (probably the Collectio
          Anselmo dedicata) and Burchard, and partly, especially for the
          newer decretals, from collections made after Gratian, In the
          division and arrangement of his work, he evidently took the code
          of Justinian for a model. The first book deals with
          ecclesiastical offices and prerequisites for judgment; the
          second, with judicial tribunals and their procedure; the third,
          with the clergy and religious orders; the fourth, with marriage,
          and the fifth with crime and its punishment. The work was
          accepted by the Bolognese teachers, and, as the first of its
          kind, became known as Compilatio prima. (2) By order of Innocent
          III. the papal notary Petrus Collivacinus of Benevento made a
          collection of the decretals of that pope, issued in the first
          eleven years of his pontificate, to 1210, based upon two earlier
          ones which had not been received at Bologna because they
          contained unauthentic documents. Innocent, sending the new work
          to the universities, guaranteed its fidelity to the Regesta,
          thus making it the first codification of canon law expressly
          authorized by any pope. This Compilatio tertia, as it is called,
          marks a turning-point in the history of canon law. The action of
          Honorius III., and still more of Gregory IX., shows how the
          development of ecclesiastical law had by their time become an
          exclusive privilege of the pope. (3) Though written after the
          last-named, that which contains the decretals of the popes from
          Alexander III, to Innocent III. is known as Compilatio secunda
          from its place in the chronological order. These particular
          decretals had already been compiled by two Englishmen at
          Bologna, Gilbert and Alan, but the university had not approved
          their work, and it was now done over by Johannes Galensis (John
          the Welshman), his collection being accepted. (4) The Lateran
          Council of 1215 gave occasion for another compilation, known as
          Quarta, which included the decrees of the council and the papal
          pronouncements of the years following 1210. Its compiler is
          unknown. (5) In 1226 Honorius III. sent to Bologna a collection
          of his own decretals and the constitutions of Frederick II. It
          was accepted as Compilatio quinta, but was soon superseded, with
          the other four, by the official collection of Gregory IX.

    2. Collection of Gregory.

          In 1230 Gregory entrusted his chaplain Raymond of Peñaforte with
          the preparation of a new collection which should reduce all that
          had gone before to a consistent and intelligible whole. Raymond
          omitted a number of sections from the older compilations in
          order to avoid repetitions or discrepancies, revised some older
          decretals to bring them into harmony with the most recent
          legislation, condensed some long documents, and divided others
          into parts which could be classified by their subjects. This
          compilation was sent to Bologna by the pope in 1234 as the only
          authorized collection.

          The legislative activity of the succeeding popes soon made
          supplements necessary, which were sent by them to the
          universities as separate compilations, but were intended to be
          added to the Gregorian collection. Thus Innocent IV. in 1245
          sent to Bologna and Paris a list of the initial words of his
          bulls, desiring that they, as well as the decrees of the Council
          of Lyons, should be inserted in their proper places in the
          decretals of Gregory IX.; thus too the decretals of Alexander
          IV., Urban IV., and Clement IV. were put together in special
          collections. Gregory X. communicated to the universities the
          acts of the Second Council of Lyons (1274), and the same was
          done with a collection of five decretals of Nicholas III.

    3. Supplements to It.

          The same reasons which had influenced Gregory IX. induced
          Boniface VIII. to combine all the post-Gregorian decretals with
          his own numerous bulls into a single whole. In his bull of
          publication addressed to the universities of Bologna and Paris,
          he emphasized the uncertainty which had prevailed in regard to
          the authenticity of some decretals, to eliminate which he had
          had a thorough revision and verification made. He promulgated
          the new compilation in 1298 under the name of Liber sextus, as
          being a completion of the five books of the Gregorian
          collection. The decretals subsequently issued by Boniface
          himself (including the famous bull Unam sanctam) and by his
          successor, Benedict XI., sixteen in number, were frequently
          appended to the Liber sextus, though without official authority.
          Clement V. had the decisions of the Council of Vienne (1311) and
          his own decretals collected (according to the traditional
          system) into five books, which he promulgated in 1313,
          apparently under the title of Liber septimus, and sent to the
          University of Orléans. Then, however, he stopped its further
          circulation and had it revised, so that it was sent to Paris and
          Bologna only by his successor John XXII. in 1317. This
          collection ultimately became known as the Clementine
          Constitutions. The difference between it and the other
          post-Gregorian compilations was that while they had borne to a
          certain extent the character of exclusive codes, it did not
          exclude the other Extravagantes which had appeared since the
          Liber sextus, and that it contained, besides the canons of
          Vienne, nothing but Clement's own decretals.

          The reason for this abandonment by Clement V. and John XXII. of
          the system of their predecessors was the difficult situation in
          France, and the desire to avoid provoking a rejection of their
          compilation by including in it matter which was certain to
          excite violent opposition there. This accounts for the fact that
          no further official collections of decretals were published. The
          increasing difficulties of the papacy with the secular power and
          with national churches made the reception of such things
          problematical, at the same time that it claimed the best
          energies of the popes for other matters. Of collections
          subsequently published, though no longer by the popes
          themselves, with the title of Extravagantes, two have retained
          some importance to the present day, because of their inclusion
          in the Corpus juris canonici. When at the end of the fifteenth
          century the booksellers Gering and Remboldt in Paris undertook
          an edition of all the parts of the Corpus, they entrusted the
          editing of the Decretum, the Liber sextus, the Clementina, and
          the Extravagantes to Jean Chappuis, who made a new arrangement
          of the last-named, preserved in all subsequent editions. He
          divided them into two collections; the first, Extravagantes
          Johannis Papæ XXII., contained twenty decretals of that pope,
          put together by himself in a chronologically consistent whole
          and glossed by Zenzelinus de Cassianis in 1325; the second,
          seventy-four (originally seventy) decretals of popes from Urban
          IV. (1261-64) to Sixtus IV. (1471-84), known as Extravagantes
          communes, not because they belong to a number of popes, but
          because they are the commonly cited ones--though no single
          previous edition had contained more than thirty-three of these.
          In 1590 Petrua Matthæus published at Lyons a Liber septimus
          containing decretals from Sixtus IV. to Sixtus V. (1585-90); but
          this, though printed as an appendix to many old editions of the
          Corpus juris canonici, never met with much recognition or use.
          Gregory XIII. appointed a commission to prepare an official
          Liber septimus, but the work, which finally included the
          dogmatic decrees of Florence and Trent, was not completely
          printed until 1598, in the pontificate of Clement VIII., under
          whose name it appeared; and then Clement, for some reason now
          unknown, refused to approve it. No further systematic collection
          of later decretals has been undertaken, though frequent
          chronological arrangements of them have been published under the
          title of Bullaria (see [729]Briefs, bulls, and Bullaria).

  7. Corpus Juris Canonici:

          It remains to give an account of the Corpus juris canonici, by
          which name it has been customary since the sixteenth century to
          designate the collection formed by combining the Decretum
          Gratiani, the decretals of Gregory IX., the Liber sextus, the
          Clementina, and the two collections of Extravagantes made by
          Chappuis. The name was applied to Gratian's work in the twelfth
          century, and by Innocent IV. to the Gregorian collection; Pierre
          d'Ailly, in his treatise De necessitate reformationis, written
          at the opening of the Council of Constance, speaks of the
          reservations prescribed "in corpore juris canonici," where there
          is no doubt that he means the sum of the collections named
          above, with the exception of the as yet non-existent
          Extravagantes. During the council the term Corpus juris or jus
          scriptum was constantly employed in contradistinction to the
          post-Clementine Extravagantes, and similarly at the Council of
          Basel. The legal authority of the Extravagantes was, in fact,
          frequently contested, and the thesis of the independent validity
          of every papal pronouncement, which had had practical effect
          since Innocent III., no longer recognized. So far, then, this
          distinction was justified, and while no new accepted collection
          was added to the Clementina the previously accepted Corpus might
          be considered as closed. The name does not occur in the oldest
          printed editions, which is to be explained by the fact that the
          component parts were usually printed separately. In the
          sixteenth century it became usual for these parts, together with
          Chappuis's two collections of Extravagantes, to be published by
          the same house in three volumes, the first containing Gratian's
          work, the second the decretals of Gregory IX., and the third the
          remainder with the glosses. In the latter half of this century,
          however, it was more common to omit the glosses and bind the
          whole in one volume, so that the inclusive title now becomes
          usual. The edition of Demochares (Paris, 1550, 1561) showed a
          certain amount of critical spirit, but with little result.
          During the sessions of the Council of Trent the need of revision
          was clearly apparent, and Pius IV. in 1563 established a
          commission of cardinals and other scholars for this purpose.
          Under his successors, Pius V. and Gregory XIII., it was
          confirmed and enlarged to thirty-five members. The work of these
          Correctores Romani, as they are called, was completed in 1580,
          and the resulting revised edition published at Rome in 1582.
          Though they had rendered valuable service, much remained to be
          done, as was made evident by the editions of Antonius Augustinus
          and Berardus--to say nothing of the modern ones. The earlier
          editions usually contained a number of appendices, including the
          Institutiones juris canonici of Paul Lancelot, professor at
          Perugia under Paul IV. (1555-59), the Liber septimus of Petrus
          Matthæus, etc.

          For the internal relations of the Roman Catholic Church the
          Corpus juris canonici is still the authority in common law,
          though with some limitations. The appendices are not considered
          authoritative, especially those just named, unless the single
          decretals contained in the last of them have been universally
          received; and the same principle applies to the Extravagantes.
          The position taken at the councils of Constance and Basel was
          not affected by the edition of Gregory XIII., whose purpose was
          not to give them an official character by including them, but
          merely to establish a correct and authentic text of the
          documents which had previously been included in widely
          circulated collections. Acting on the same principle in regard
          to this edition of Gregory XIII., most modern canonists deny the
          positive authority of the Decretum Gratiani as such, since it
          was a mere private collection, never officially authorized by
          the Church or the pope, and regard it only as a valuable
          collection of documents for the history of canon law. This view
          was even expressed in a decision of the Rota Romana, too long to
          quote here, and more than once by Benedict XIV. But though this
          may be theoretically the case, yet in practise the Decretum has
          retained a large measure of authority: and Gregory XIII. himself
          would scarcely have displayed so much zeal in having it edited
          and completed if he had regarded it as no more than a private
          compilation, without legal authority. Its contents, however,
          have in the lapse of time been to a great extent modified or
          rendered obsolete by later decretals, so that its practical
          importance is small.

          Besides the general principle that a new law supersedes an older
          one, which has destroyed the validity of so much that is in the
          Corpus juris (not merely in Gratian's part of it), the course of
          secular legislation since the fourteenth century has, had a
          marked influence in the same direction. The canon law covers not
          merely the doctrine, worship, sacraments, and discipline of the
          Church, but a vast mass of other things in which ecclesiastical
          interests were supposed to be concerned, such as vows, oaths,
          betrothals, wills, funerals, benefices, church property, tithes,
          and the like. The reaction against the all-embracing claims of
          the Church has taken many of these things out of the hands of
          the ecclesiastical tribunals (see [730]Jurisdiction,
          Ecclesiastical), while by its proclamation of the principle of
          the unity of national law and government it has reduced the
          Church to the position of any other corporation within the
          limits of the State; and thus a large number of canonical
          provisions, such as those covering the procedure against
          heretics, which conflict with the civil constitution, have
          necessarily become ineffective. In France, Belgium, and Italy it
          is still regarded as a part of the general body of law. In the
          German Empire, after gradual restrictions in many of the
          component states, it ceased on Jan. 1, 1900, to have any legal
          validity outside of the internal discipline of the Roman
          Catholic Church.

          Canon of Scripture is a term that designates the books of the
          Bible accepted as authoritative. The word "canon" (Gk. kanOn)
          means primarily a straight staff, then a measuring-rod, hence,
          figuratively, that which is artistically, scientifically, or
          ethically a guide or a model; so in the earliest Christian use
          (Gal. vi. 16; Phil. iii. 16; Clement of Rome, i. 7, 41) the
          canon was a leading thought, a normal principle. The next change
          of meaning (indicated by Clement of Alexandria, Strom., VII.
          xvi. 94) was to a type of Christian doctrine, the orthodox as
          opposed to the heretical. Since 300 the plural form "canons" has
          been used of ecclesiastical regulations (see [731]Canon). Now,
          since the Christian doctrines were professedly based upon the
          Scriptures, the writings themselves were naturally known as the
          canon; and the test of the canonicity of any particular writing
          was its reception by the Church. The earliest use of the word in
          this sense is in the fifty-ninth canon of the Council of
          Laodicea (363), "No psalms of private authorship can be read in
          the Church, nor uncanonical books, but only the canonical books
          of the Old and New Testaments," and contemporaneously in
          Athanasius (Epistola festalis, i. 961, Paris, 1698). A few years
          later the use was general.

I. The Canon of the Old Testament.

  1. History Among the Jews.

    1. Traditional Account of the Rise of the Collection.

          The theory, which was almost universally received for fifteen
          hundred years, that Ezra was the author of the Old Testament
          canon, dates from the first Christian century; for it is found
          in IV (II) Ezra xiv. 44 that Ezra was inspired to dictate during
          forty days to five men ninety-four books, of which twenty-four
          were to be published. These twenty-four quite evidently are the
          twenty-four books of the Hebrew canon, according to the counting
          given below; and the seventy are the Jewish Apocrypha alluded to
          in the Gospel of Nicodemus xxviii. (ANF, viii. 453). What the
          Fathers have to say upon this matter is derived in part from IV
          Ezra, and is equally fabulous.

    2. The Theory of the Synagogue.

          The theory above mentioned has been supposed to be the one
          prevalent among the Jews themselves. But this has no other
          support than that the eminent rabbis David Kimchi (d. 1240) and
          Elias Levita (1472-1549) remarked on the work of Ezra and the
          men of the Great Synagogue, in bringing together the twenty-four
          books in their divisions. The only Talmudic passage which can be
          quoted directly in its behalf is in Baba Bathra; for the other
          quotations commonly made prove merely the care of Ezra and the
          men of the Great Synagogue for the law, not for the canon;
          indeed, mostly for the oral law, and some also for alterations
          in the text. The passage is in these words: "The order of the
          prophets is Joshua and Judges, Samuel and Kings, Jeremiah and
          Ezekiel, Isaiah and the Twelve. Hosea is the first, because it
          is written, '

          The beginning of the word of Jehovah by Hosea' (i. 2). Did God,
          then, speak to Hosea first? and have there not been many
          prophets between him and Moses? R. Johanan explained this as
          meaning that Hosea was the first of the four prophets who
          prophesied at that time,--Hosea, Isaiah, Amos, and Micah. Why,
          then, was he not put first? Because his prophesy stands next to
          that of the latest prophets, Haggai, Zechariah, and Malachi: he
          is therefore counted with them. So this prophet should have been
          kept by himself, and inserted before Jeremiah? No: he was so
          small that he might then easily have been lost. Since Isaiah
          lived before Jeremiah and Ezekiel, ought he not to have been put
          before them? [No.] because Kings closes with destruction,
          Jeremiah is entirely occupied with it, Ezekiel begins with it
          but ends with consolation, while Isaiah is all consolation;
          hence we can not connect destruction with destruction, and
          consolation with consolation. But Job lived in the time of
          Moses; why should he not come in the first part? No; for it
          would never do to begin with misfortune. Yet Ruth contains
          misfortune? True; but it issues in joy. And who wrote them?
          Moses wrote his book and the Balaam section and Job. Joshua
          wrote his book and eight verses in the Law (Deut. xxxiv. 5-12).
          Samuel wrote his book, Judges and Ruth. David wrote Psalms for
          ten Elders. Jeremiah wrote his book, Kings, and Lamentations.
          Hezekiah and his company wrote Isaiah, Proverbs, the Song, and
          Ecclesiastes. The men of the Great Synagogue wrote Ezekiel, The
          Twelve, Daniel, and Esther. Ezra wrote his book and the
          genealogies in Chronicles up to his time. That is a support for
          the saying of Rab; for Rab Jehuda says, in the name of Rab,
          'Ezra did not leave Babylon until he had written his own family
          register.' Who ended it? Nehemiah the son of Hachaliah." The
          understanding of this passage depends upon observing that the
          word "wrote" is used in different senses, of actual authorship,
          of editorship, and of merely collecting and placing together
          books which had not before been brought into connection. It will
          be perceived that the passage says nothing about the closing of
          the canon, but also that it would readily furnish ground for the
          idea that the canon was closed in the time of Ezra and the Great
          Synagogue.

    3. Criticism of the Two Theories.

          Both theories agree in assigning the collection of the Old
          Testament to Ezra and his companions and successors, and also
          asserting that the division into the Law, the Prophets, and the
          Hagiographa (see below) was primitive. But against this, two
          objections may be urged: (1) Critical investigation assigns the
          first part of the Book of Daniel, on account of its Greek words,
          to a time when Greek was understood, and the second part to the
          Maccabean age (see [732]Daniel, Book of); (2) The position of
          some of the historical books, e.g., Ezra and Daniel, among the
          Hagiographa, is inexplicable if the canon was made at one time.
          Moses Maimonides, David Kimchi, and Abarbanel explained the fact
          by a difference in inspiration. But Christ calls Daniel a
          prophet (Matt. xxiv. 15; Mark xiii. 14).

    4. Positive Exposition.

    a. The Pentateuch--the So-called "First Canon."

          The Hebrews, like other ancient peoples, preserved their sacred
          writings in sacred places. So the law was put by the side of the
          ark of the covenant (Deut. xxxi. 26), with its additions by
          Joshua (Josh. xxiv. 26); Samuel laid the law of the kingdom
          "before the Lord" (I Sam. x. 25); Hilkiah, the high priest under
          Josiah, found the book of the law "in the house of the Lord" (II
          Kings xxii. 8). We are, therefore, safe in believing that since
          the time of Moses documents and intelligence concerning the
          Mosaic giving of the law, besides the tables of the covenant,
          and also whatever of law and history Moses had written, were
          carefully preserved in the sanctuary (Ex. xxiv. 4, 7, xxxiv. 27;
          Num. xxxiii. 2). The priests also would retain partly oral and
          partly written information (subsequently combined in the
          Priest-code) in regard to many similar matters. The existence of
          an authoritative code is proved (a) by the use of the "Book of
          the Covenant" in Deut., and (b) in the Priest-code; (c) by Hos.
          viii. 12; (d) by II Kings xxii. The Books of Kings, finished
          during the exile, mention by name the "Book of the Law of
          Moses," by which only Deuteronomy is meant (cf. II Kings xiv. 6;
          Deut. xxiv. 16; I Kings ii. 3; II Kings xxiii. 25). The mention
          of the Book of the Law of Moses (Josh. i. 7-8; viii. 31, 34,
          xxiii. 6) can not be taken without limitation, since it proceeds
          from the Deuteronomic editor of Joshua. Hag. ii. 11-13 shows the
          existence of the Priest-code, dealing, as the passage does, with
          two statutes of that code. The Wellhausen hypothesis, that the
          Priest-code was the private possession of Ezra till 445 B.C.,
          and that Neh. viii.-x. tells of the introduction of the law, is
          in incompatible contradiction with that passage. The lowest date
          for the separation of Joshua [from the Pentateuch] is the time
          of Nehemiah and the Samaritan schism.

    b. The Historico-prophetic and Distinctively prophetic Books--the "Second
    Canon."

          The prophets were the spiritual exhorters and guides of the
          people, and therefore held in high esteem by the faithful, whose
          natural desire to have a collection of their writings there is
          every reason to believe was early gratified. At all events, it
          is quite evident from the prophetic parallels that the prophets
          were acquainted with one another's writings. The loss of so much
          sacred literature in the destruction of Jerusalem by the
          Chaldeans made the collection of the remaining historic as well
          as prophetic books the more imperative. The success of a
          collection of historical books was furthered by the fact that
          Joshua continued the narrative of the Pentateuch. Since Kings
          continues the history in I and II Sam., and may be placed in the
          latter half of the exilic period, the close connection with the
          earlier prophets gave the name to them of "the Former Prophets"
          and secured a high estimate for their on the return from
          Babylon.

    c. The Hagiographa the "Third Canon."

          David and Solomon began the arrangement of the temple
          praise-service and a collection of Psalms, and later collections
          and individual Psalms were added. The time of Nehemiah was very
          productive. The division into five books is older than the
          Chronicler. The first collection of the Proverbs of Solomon (cf.
          Prov. x. 1-xxii. 16) was so highly valued that Hezekiah ordered
          a second to be prepared (Prov. xxv. 1). The name of the wise man
          sufficed to recommend Canticles; its age and contents, the Book
          of Job. Lamentations appealed directly to every patriotic Jew
          during the exile, and was accepted as sacred, although Jeremiah
          was not its author. Ruth, by age, and especially by its
          genealogy of David, was put in the third canon, and formed an
          introduction to the Psalter. These early writings were followed
          gradually by the others, Ezra-Neh., I and II Chron., Eccles.,
          Esther (an explanation of Purim, the festival the Persian Jews
          brought back with them), and finally Daniel, in the time of the
          Maccabees. After this time, and down to the destruction of
          Jerusalem by Titus, 70 A.D., the nation was so affected by Greek
          customs, and divided by the growing rival parties, the Pharisees
          and Sadducees, that its religious development was too much
          hindered for any work to receive universal recognition, and
          hence canonicity. The reception of Dan. into the canon appears
          explicable under the circumstances only if a Daniel narrative,
          the basis of Dan. ii.-vi., already existed (cf. Ezek. xiv. 14,
          20; xxviii. 3). Not long after the Maccabees, the second
          collection or canon received its name, the Prophets, descriptive
          not only of a portion of its contents, but of their authorship;
          and thus the three divisions of the Old Testament canon--the
          Law, Prophets, and Hagiographa--dated from the second century
          B.C. (cf. the Prologue to Ecclesiasticus). Valentin Loescher (De
          causis linguæ Hebrææ, p. 71, Leipsic, 1706) said rightly: "The
          canon came not, as they say, by one act of man, but gradually
          from God."

  2. Witnesses for the Second and Third Parts of the Canon.

          Jesus Sirach (Ecclus. xlvi.-xlix., especially xlix. 10) shows
          acquaintance only with the Prophets in the wider sense the
          "second canon." His grandson testifies to the third division
          also. The Second Book of Maccabees, dated by Niece (Kritik der
          beiden Makkabäerbücher, Berlin, 1900) 125-124 B.C., in the
          section i. 10-ii. 18 contains an account of the recovery of the
          sacred fire, a quotation from the "records" of Jeremiah (a lost
          apocryphal writing); and then follows ii. 13: "And the same
          things also were reported in the records, namely, the memoirs of
          Nehemiah [another apocryphal writing], and how he, founding a
          library, gathered together the books concerning the kings and
          prophets, and those of David, and epistles of kings concerning
          holy gifts." This reference to the "epistles of kings concerning
          holy gifts" can not denote the Book of Ezra, but only a
          collection of documents regarding international matters, such as
          would be of value to a statesman like Nehemiah, and which had
          connection with the temple and its offerings. It, therefore,
          bears witness to Nehemiah's collection of the second canon
          substantially as we have it to-day, in addition to the Psalms
          and the documents so weighty for the rebuilt city. The next
          verse, "And in like manner also Judas gathered together all
          those books that had been scattered by reason of the war we had
          and they are with us," applies only to the third canon.
          Therefore, the last enlargement of the Hebrew canon took place
          under Judas Maccabæus; although probably most of the books of
          the third canon had previously been preserved in the temple
          archives.

          Philo had the same canon as ours (cf. C. Siegfried, Philo, p.
          161, Jena, 1875), and quotes from almost all the books; while
          from the Apocrypha he makes no excerpts or citation, not giving
          it the honor he accords to Plato, Hippocrates, and several other
          Greek writers. [10] The New Testament contains quotations
          principally from the Pentateuch, Prophets, and Psalms, as might
          be conjectured from its scope, but recognizes the threefold
          division of the canon (Luke xxiv. 44). In this verse "The
          Psalms" does not stand for the entire Hagiographa; for our Lord
          meant to emphasize the fact that the Psalms spoke of him. The
          use of the phrase "the Law and the Prophets " (Matt. v. 17; Acts
          xxviii. 23) does not imply a division into two parts. The
          Syrians used the same expression for the whole Old Testament.
          The absence of quotation in the New Testament of any Old
          Testament book argues nothing against its canonicity. The use by
          the New Testament of Apocrypha or Pseudepigrapha has no bearing
          on the canonical status of the books used of cited. Josephus
          (Apion, i. 8) bears the strongest testimony for the canon, [11]
          and, as is evident, expresses the national and not his private
          opinion. And, further, the books mentioned are not mere
          literature, but a sacred, divine collection. He enumerates
          twenty-two books; thus, 1. The five books of the Law; 2. The
          thirteen Prophets, counting the twelve minor Prophets as one
          book, and Lamentations with Jeremiah; 3. The four
          Hagiographa--Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, and Canticles. But
          this arrangement is not to be looked upon as either old or
          correct.

  3. Supposed Jewish Dissent from the Canon.

          This dissent is not real, only apparent; but appeal has been
          made (a) to the Talmudical controversies about certain books,
          e.g., Esther; on further examination these "controversies" are
          perceived to be mere intellectual displays; there is no
          intention of rejecting any book. (b) The Book of Sirach, it is
          said, is quoted as Scripture; but there is no proof that it was
          regarded as Scripture, and the two or three quotations are
          memoriter, and probably made under a misapprehension of their
          source. (c) A high regard for the Book of Baruch is asserted,
          but all Jewish literature furnishes no proof. On the other hand,
          the late origin of the book is against the assumption; it is
          dependent upon Dan. ix., and was not composed till after the
          capture of Jerusalem by Titus. (d) The Septuagint is supposed by
          some to show that the Alexandrian Jews had a different canon
          from the Palestinian, because books are added to the canonical
          twenty-four and additions are made to some of the canonical
          books; but this does not follow. For the Palestinian idea of a
          canon (namely, the compositions of inspired prophets, a class of
          men not then existent) was not known in Alexandria, where, on
          the contrary, the statement of Wisdom (vii. 27), "[Wisdom] from
          generation to generation entering into holy souls prepares them
          friends of God, and prophets," was fully believed, as by Philo
          (cf. De cherubim, ix.) and Josephus (War, I. iii. 5, II. viii.
          12, III. viii. 3, 9), who even declared that they themselves had
          been at times really inspired, and freely accorded the fact unto
          others. Therefore, to an Alexandrian Jew, there was no
          impropriety in enlarging the Greek translation of the Old
          Testament, not only by additions of sections to the canonical
          books, but of entirely new books. The great respect entertained
          for the Septuagint was extended to these additions, but without
          giving the latter any canonical authority. There was no
          Alexandrian canon; for neither the number nor the order of the
          books added was fixed.

  4. History of the Old Testament Canon Among the Jews:

    1. The Triple Division.

          The Triple Division of the Hebrew canon is testified to by the
          prologue to Sirach and the New Testament (Luke xxiv. 44). The
          Septuagint gave up this division in favor of a different
          one--the present Christian arrangement of the books in the
          order, history, poetry, prophecy--and inserted the apocryphal
          books and sections in appropriate places.

    2. Order.

          The order of the books in the Hebrew canon is as follows: 1. The
          Torah or "Law"--the five books of Moses; 2. The Nebhiim or
          "Prophets"--(a) the " Former Prophets," Joshua, Judges, I and II
          Samuel, I and II Kings; (b) the "Latter Prophets," Isaiah,
          Jeremiah. Ezekiel, the twelve minor Prophets; 3. The Kethubhim
          ("Writings") or Hagiographa--Psalms, Proverbs, Job, Canticles,
          Ruth, Lamentations, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Daniel, Ezra, and
          Nehemiah, I and II Chronicles, in all, twenty-four books. The
          view once entertained that Ruth and Lam. once were in the second
          canon and were transferred to the third when it was formed has
          no basis in fact. The principle of arrangement of the
          historico-prophetical books is chronological. The Mishnah
          arranges the prophetical books proper in order of length: Jer.,
          Ezek., Isa., the Twelve. But with this went probably the
          recollection that as a whole Isa. was later than Jer. and Ezek.
          The Masorites put Isa. first. In some MSS. of the third canon
          the most important book, Ps., introduced by Ruth, is at the
          head, then Job and the three books connected with Solomon's
          name, and the four latest books at the close. The Masorites
          arrange: Chron., Ps., Job, Prov., Ruth, Song of Sol., Eccles.,
          Lam., Esther, Dan., Ezra. Manuscripts differ greatly in the
          order of these books.

    3. Number of the Canonical Books.

          Jewish tradition, except when influenced by Alexandria,
          unanimously gives the number as twenty-four. Nevertheless, it is
          usual to say that the original reckoning was twenty-two. If, how
          ever, the witnesses for the latter number be not counted, but
          weighed, it is plain that the authority they rest upon is
          Alexandrian; and this is worthless for getting at the primitive
          reckoning, because the Alexandrian Jews not only altered the
          order and division of the books, but added to them others not in
          the canon. Further more, the Alexandrians arrived at the number
          twenty-two by joining Ruth to Judges, and Lamentations to
          Jeremiah. Having thus made twenty-two, they were impressed with
          its numerical agreement with the number of letters in the Hebrew
          alphabet. This idea was thought significant, part of the divine
          intention indeed; and so it became fixed in the Jewish mind. The
          Church Fathers took it up in their uncritical fashion; and so it
          has come down to our day. Josephus first gives twenty-two; but
          he makes greater use of the Septuagint than of the Hebrew
          original. It is note-worthy that Epiphanius and Jerome, who
          reckon the books twenty-two, mention also twenty-seven; i.e.,
          the Hebrew twenty-two letters, with the five final letters (the
          letters which have a special form when at the end of a word);
          made by separating the double books, Samuel, Kings, Chronicles,
          and Ezra. But this double counting was only possible for Jews
          using the Septuagint, since the original does not divide these
          books. Further, neither in the Talmud nor in the Midrash is
          there the least trace of any acquaintance with the number
          twenty-two; but, on the contrary, twenty-four is always given,
          not because it corresponds with the twenty-four Greek letters,
          but simply as the natural result of the gradual rise of the
          canon. In the present printed Hebrew Bible the number is
          thirty-nine, similarly counted, though not arranged, with those
          of Protestant Bibles.

  5. The Old Testament Canon in the Christian Church:

    1. Patristic and Medieval Writers.

          The Fathers did not impugn the authority of the Old Testament;
          but, because of the universal use of the Septuagint, they
          recognized as Scripture what we regard as Apocrypha. Origen, who
          counts only the books of the Hebrew canon, yet speaks of
          Jeremiah, Lamentations, and the Epistle as in one [book]. Justin
          Martyr used the additions to Daniel; Irenæus, Tertullian,
          Clement of Alexandria, Cyprian, and others used the Apocrypha
          with the same formula of citation as when they used the Old
          Testament. From the fourth century the Greek Fathers make less
          and less use of the Apocrypha; while in the Latin Church
          conciliar action justified and emphasized their use. Jerome
          alone speaks out decidedly for the Hebrew canon. During the
          Middle Ages the Apocrypha were not recognized by the majority of
          the Greeks; while just the opposite was true of the Latins,
          although not a few followed Jerome.

          The Book of Esther, because of its contents, was sometimes
          excluded from the Christian Old Testament canon. Melito of
          Sardis (170 A.D.) omits it from his list (see Eusebius, Hist.
          eccl., IV. xxvi.), although perhaps it has rather dropped out
          after Esdras (Ezra), inasmuch as in other lists it comes next to
          this name. It is also omitted by Athanasius (Epistola Festalis,
          i. 961, ed. Bened.), Gregory Nazianzen (Carm., xxxiii.), and in
          the sixth century by Junilius (De partibus legis divinæ, i.
          3-7). On the other hand, it is included in the canon by Origen,
          Cyril of Jerusalem, and Epiphanius.

    2. The Ancient Oriental Versions.

          The old Syrian Church did not receive the Apocrypha. They are
          not in the Peshito, although found in a later Syriac
          translation. Ephraem Syrus (d. 373) does not give them canonical
          authority. Aphraates (fourth century) cites from every canonical
          book, but uses the Apocrypha sparingly and not in such a way
          that they must be regarded as canonical. A great difference is
          perceptible in the Peshito translation between Chronicles and
          the other books. This has started the query whether Chronicles
          was accepted as canonical by the Syrian Church. The Nestorians
          certainly rejected it and Esther. The Ethiopic translation
          follows the Septuagint throughout, and contains not only the
          canonical but also the apocryphal books, except that for I and
          II Maccabees it substitutes two books of its own under the same
          name, and some pseudographs of which the Greek texts do not now
          exist; for the Ethiopic Church makes even less difference than
          the Alexandrian between canonical and uncanonical books. (See
          [733]Pseudepigrapha, Old Testament.)

    3. The Roman Catholic Church.

          The Roman Catholic Church is committed to the use of the
          Apocrypha as Scripture by the decision of the Council of Trent
          at the fourth session. In order to get a normal text for
          purposes of quotation, a Bible was published in Rome in 1592
          under the order and care of the pope. In it is given Jerome's
          remark, that the additions to Esther and Daniel which are
          printed are not in the Hebrew text; and in smaller type the
          candid announcement is prefaced to the Prayer of Manasees and
          the Third and Fourth Books of Ezra, that, while it is true they
          are not in the Scripture canon of the Council of Trent, they are
          still included because they are quoted occasionally by certain
          of the Fathers, and are found both in printed and manuscript
          copies of the Latin Bible. The decree of the council was not
          passed without opposition; and later Roman Catholics, such as Du
          Pin, Dissertation préliminaire ou prolégomènes sur la Bible,
          Paris, 1699; and B. Lamy, Apparatus biblicus, II. v. 333, Lyons,
          1723, have endeavored to establish two classes of canonical
          books--the protocanonical and the deuterocanonical--attributing
          to the first a dogmatic, and to the second only an ethical
          authority; but this distinction contravenes the decision of
          Trent, and has found little support.

    4. The Greek Church.

          In early times and in the Middle Ages many distinguished three
          kinds of writings, the canonical, recognized, and apocryphal. So
          the "Easter Epistle" of Athanasius. The synods of Constantinople
          (1638), Jassy (1642), and Jerusalem (1672) expressly reject the
          view of Cyril Lucar, patriarch of Constantinople, and others,
          which distinguishes the canonical form from the apocryphal. And
          the last, which is the most important in the history of the
          Eastern Church, defined its position in regard to the Apocrypha
          in the answer to the third question appended to the Confession
          of Dositheus, in which it expressly mentions Wisdom, Judith,
          Tobit, History of Bel and the Dragon, History of Susannah, the
          Maccabees (four books), and Ecclesiasticus as canonical. Reuss
          (Geschichte der heiligen Schriften, § 338, Brunswick, 1878) says
          that the official Moscow edition of the Bible of 1831 has all
          the Apocrypha, Ezra, in both recensions, with Neh. and I-IV
          Macc. at the end of the historical books, the Prophets before
          the seven Poetical or Wisdom books. But the "Longer Catechism"
          of Philaret (Moscow, 1839), the most authoritative doctrinal
          standard of the orthodox Greco-Russian Church, expressly leaves
          out the apocryphal books from its list on the ground that "they
          do not exist in the Hebrew" (cf. Schaff, Creeds, ii. 451). See
          [734]Eastern Church, III., § 9.

    5. The Protestant Church.

          The Lutheran symbols do not give any express declaration against
          the Apocrypha. Nevertheless, they are denied dogmatic value.
          Luther translated them, not, however, III and IV Ezra, and
          recommended them for private reading, excepting Baruch and II
          Macc. In the first complete edition of the Bible (Zurich, 1530)
          the Apocrypha stood at the end. With this agree the decisions of
          the other Reformed churches: the "Gallican Confession," 1559,
          §§ 3, 4; "Belgic Confession," 1561, §§ 4-6; "Thirty-nine
          Articles," 1562, § 6 (cf. Schaff, Creeds of Christendom, iii.).
          The Book of Common Prayer contains readings from the Apocrypha
          and especial recommendation of portions of Wisdom and Sirach. At
          the Synod of Dort (1618), Gomarus and others raised an animated
          discussion by demanding the exclusion of the apocryphal Ezra,
          Tobit, Judith, and Bel and the Dragon from the Bible. This the
          synod refused to do, although speaking strongly against the
          Apocrypha. Similarly opposed to them was the Westminster
          Assembly of Divines, 1647, Confession of Faith, i. 3; the
          Arminians, Confessio . . . pastorum, qui . . . remonstrantes
          vocantur, i. 3, 6; the Socinians (Ostorodt, Unterrichtung von
          den vornehmsten Hauptpunckten der christlichen Religion, Rakau,
          1604) and the Mennonites (Johann Ris, Præcipuorum Christianæ
          fidei articulorum brevis confessio, xxix.) agree with the other
          Protestants. For history of the relation of the Bible societies
          to the Apocrypha, see [735]Bible Societies. For the Apocrypha in
          general, see [736]Apocrypha.

  6. The Names of the Old Testament and of Its Chief Divisions:

          (a) Hebrew. Neh. viii. 8 has the expression Mikra, "Reading,"
          which here must signify the Law. Dan. ix. 2 has Sepherim, "the
          Books"; Kitebe hakkodesh, "the Holy Writings," is Talmudic. The
          division into three parts is common in the Talmud, with the
          names Torah, Nebhiim, and Kethubhim, "Law, Prophets, and
          Writings," with the abbreviation TNK. Often the whole is
          embraced in the term Torah. The first part is named also "The
          Five Fifths of the Law." The first part of the prophetical canon
          is called " the Former Prophets "; the second part "the Latter
          Prophets." The third part of the canon is known as "the
          Writings" and "the Sacred Writings." The Song of Sol., Ruth,
          Lam., Eccles., and Esther are classed together as Megillot,
          "Rolls." The second and third parts are often named together as
          the kabbalah. (b) Greek. It may be concluded that by the time of
          the translator of Ecclus. the words "the Books" were in use,
          since he speaks of "the other [books]," "the rest [of the
          books]." In the New Testament they are called "the Scripture,"
          "Holy" or "Sacred Writings"; the Pentateuch is called "the Old
          Covenant" in II Cor. iii. 14. Among the Greek Fathers the
          following names are used: "The Books of the Old Covenant," "The
          Sacred (Holy) Writings of the Old Covenant," the "Old Covenant,"
          "the Twenty-two Books of the Old Covenant," "the Covenant
          Books," and "Law and Prophets." (c) Latin. Vetus testamentum
          translates Hebr. berith, "covenant"; instrumentum, totum
          instrumentum utriusque testamenti, vetus scriptura, vetus lex,
          and veteris legis libri are used.

          (H. L. Strack.)

II. The Canon of the New Testament

  1. The Terms Used.

          Alongside the word canon, expressing the idea of the collection
          of scriptures, were used the terms "covenant" (derived from the
          Old Testament, Ex. xxiv. 27), "Scripture" or "Scriptures" with
          the qualifying words "holy," "sacred," "divine," or "of the
          Lord," also " Law and Gospel," "Prophets and Apostles." The word
          endiathekos, "contained in the covenant," was opposed to
          apokryphos, "apocryphal," the former word often containing the
          meaning "used in public service."

  2. The New Testament, 170-220:

          Since there are at command no specific reports concerning the
          origin of the New Testament, an examination of the facts which
          may throw light upon the problem must be made in order to
          discover that origin. A starting-point is found in the period of
          the contest between the Gnostic sects, particularly the
          Marcionites and the Valentinians, and the orthodox. The
          Montanistic movement was under way during this period, though it
          was concerned not so much with the New Testament as with its own
          objects. The Church had a New Testament already commonly so
          called, over against the Montanistic contention of a new period
          of prophecy already opened which was to lead the way to a wider
          development: The Church regarded the age of revelation as closed
          with the death of the last surviving apostle and the canon of
          the New Testament as completed, though discussion still went on
          as to the inclusion of some books therein. In opposition to
          Marcion and Montanus the. Church had the feeling that it had an
          inviolable possession in the two Testaments, and the Montanist
          himself distinguished them from the body of "new prophecy."

    1. The Four Gospels.

          Opposed to the gospel which Marcion prepared for his
          communities, to the Evangelium veritatis used by the
          Valentinians alongside the four Gospels of the Church, to the
          discarding of the Johannean Gospel by the Alogi, and to the
          exclusive use of Matthew or Mark by other parties of the Church;
          is the statement of Irenæus that the spirit which created the
          world had given to the Church its gospel in fourfold form (Hær.,
          III. xi. 8), to violate which was a sin against God's revelation
          and spirit. The unity of these is asserted in the designation bf
          them as "the Gospel" (in the singular), and in the titles "the
          Gospel according to Matthew," etc. Clement of Alexandria in his
          discussion of the origin of the Gospels dealt only with the
          four. Recollection was soon lost of the fact that a gospel not
          among the four had striven to be retained in use in public
          service, and that one of the four had had to win its place among
          them. But even the Alegi did not deny that the Fourth Gospel
          belonged to the age of John and had ever since been in the
          Church. Tatian's preparation for the Syrians of the
          "Diatessaron" witnesses by its very title to the fact that for
          an ecclesiastical book of the Gospels no other sources than the
          four were conceivable. The very permission given by Serapion of
          Antioch (c. 200) to certain of his parishioners to read a gospel
          called that of Peter, which he gave without reading the book and
          through confidence in them, really speaks for the same set of
          facts, as does the subsequent annulment of the permission.
          Origen sums up the practise of that period in the saying: "The
          Church values only the four Gospels (1 Hom. in Lucam).

    2.The Pauline Letters.

          Generally thirteen epistles of Paul were received. If in the
          Muratorian Canon the reception of four private letters is
          justified, it appears to have been caused less by a recollection
          of a late introduction of them into public service than through
          a thought-process of the author, equating the seven letters of
          Paul to the communities in symbolical fashion with the letters
          to the seven churches of the Apocalypse. No statement can be
          made regarding any favorable feeling for the letters to the
          Laodiceans and the Alexandrians there rejected. Great difference
          of opinion existed as to Hebrews. The Alexandrians regarded it
          as Pauline, and Origen supposed it substantially Pauline through
          one of Paul's disciples, a position which was widely adopted in
          the eastern Church. But the western Church disputed its
          Paulinity, while holding it in high esteem. This was the case in
          Lyons, Rome, and Carthage. In the Montanistic and Novatian
          Churches there was a decided tendency to ascribe it to Barnabas.

    3. The Acts of the Apostles.

          Of the Book of Acts all that need be said is that its name, its
          general recognition as of Lucan authorship, its position between
          the Gospels and the Pauline Epistles in the Muratorian Canon,
          its abundant use by Irenæus, Tertullian, and others, and the
          condemnation by Tertullian of Marcion for rejecting it speak
          abundantly for its canonicity.

    4. The Apocalypse.

          The strongest proofs are found of the reception of the
          Apocalypse by all parts of the Church. It was cited by
          Theophilus of Antioch about 180, and by the church of Lyons in
          177, as "Holy Scripture." Neither Irenæus nor the Muratorian
          Canon regard any defense of it as necessary. As against the high
          value attached to it by the Montanists, the Alogi scornfully
          criticized it as the work of Cerinthus. Caius of Rome assumed
          this attitude also, and Hippolytus defended it against him. But
          the general feeling of the catholic Church was that the book was
          inspired, written about 95 A.D., and properly closed the New
          Testament.

    5. The Catholic Epistles.

          The Position of the Catholic Epistles about 200 was a very
          varied one, though about 300 they were known as one division of
          the New Testament. II and III John must have been attached to I
          John, if their history in the Church and their preservation are
          understood. Testimony to II John comes from Irenæus and Clement
          of Alexandria; that III John was not treated by Clement does not
          really damage the case. The doubt which stood in the way of the
          unconditional recognition of II and III John was soon banished.
          It is almost certain that the Muratorian Canon designated the
          two lesser epistles as recognized. Where it was not known that
          the Apostle John was by his disciples called "the Elder," there
          was likelihood of the authorship of those two being questioned
          on the matter of genuineness. Their brevity was against both
          frequent citation and frequent use in public and equally against
          serious question, Jude, as one of the Catholic Epistles, was the
          subject of comment by Clement of Alexandria. The Muratorian
          Canon quoted it as received. Tertullian cited it as the
          convincing writing of an apostle, though Origen remarked that it
          was not generally received. In the fourth century it was among
          the antilegomena (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., III. xxv. 3). The
          canonicity which it had in the earlier times was later lost for
          it in a wide circle of the Church. James, though read in the
          West in early times and known probably both to Irenæus and to
          Hippolytus, was until the middle of the fourth century not in
          the New Testament of the western Church. The Canon Muratori is
          silent; among the Greeks of the East it was among the generally
          recognized scriptures. Though Origen placed it among the
          antilegomena, in Codex Claromontanus it stands before I John. A
          noteworthy fact is that Methodius mistakenly ascribed it to
          Paul. In 325 it was by many considered not genuine and Eusebius
          put it among the antilegomena (Hist. eccl., III. xxv. 3). The
          general recognition of I Peter about the year 200 is vouched for
          by Irenæus, the Epistle of Lyons, Clement of Alexandria,
          Tertullian, and Hippolytus. The silence of the Muratorian Canon
          would have been inexplicable, and to it must refer the remark
          that a letter of Peter is received as is the Apocalypse. Against
          II Peter there were many protests. At Rome it was not unknown,
          but was not on the same footing as I Peter. It is doubtful
          whether Irenæus knew it. Origen's personal opinion was
          favorable, but he recorded a divided opinion in the Church
          concerning the letter. In the East its position was different
          from that of I Peter in that there it was rot a New Testament
          book (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., IV. xxv. 8). As late as 380 Didymus
          pronounced it uncanonical and the Syrians determinedly rejected
          it. Of the Epistle of Barnabas it may be said that Clement of
          Alexandria seems to have included it among the Catholic
          Epistles, and the same is true of Origen. Codex Claromontanus
          puts it after the seven Catholic Epistles and before Revelation.
          It is pertinent here to remark that the first and second
          Epistles of Clement are by the Canones Apostolorum, lxxxv., put
          between the Epistle of Barnabas and the Didache. I Clement is
          elsewhere given as a Catholic Epistle; at Corinth it was used
          occasionally in public service, a usage which spread to
          Alexandria and to Syria. It was cited by Clement of Alexandria
          and by Origen. But its connection with the New Testament was
          less firm even than that of Barnabas; in the West it was not
          considered as of the canon, and Irenæus seems to have employed
          it as belonging to the subapostolic age.

    6. Writings Temporarily Regarded as Canonical.

          The Shepherd of Hermas was used as scripture by Irenæus, Clement
          of Alexandria, and in Antioch. At the beginning of the third
          century there was in Catholic and Montanistic circles a
          loosening of the connection between this book and the canon.
          Tertullian, contrary to his earlier practise, owing to the
          laxity of discipline attributed to this book, declared that it
          should be regarded as apocryphal and even as false. The
          Muratorian Canon excluded it from the regular and public reading
          of the Scriptures, though its perusal was permitted and even
          enjoined. This was the first attempt to form a secondary canon.
          There are two Latin translations of the book, and an unknown
          Roman bishop cited it as scripture, while Novatian and Commodian
          indorsed it, and the Latin liturgies show its influence. Yet by
          an ecclesiastical decision about 200-210 the Shepherd was set
          outside the canon. While Clement of Alexandria did not include
          the Shepherd in his brief commentary, he did treat the
          Apocalypse of Peter, a little book of about 300 lines. This book
          closed the canon of Codex Claromontanus; but the Armenian List
          put it among the Apocrypha, and Eusebius (Hist. eccl., III. xxv.
          4, cf. iii. 2) declared against its genuineness. Sozomen says
          that it was used as late as 430 in Palestine at Easter. The
          Didache was cited and used as scripture by Clement and Origen,
          and during the next century this was its status in Egypt.
          Eusebius (Hist. eccl., III, xxv. 4) put it among the
          antilegomena of the second grade. It was known in the
          neighborhood of Antioch and in the West. The apocryphal Acts of
          the Apostles were often read in the early Church without
          question. The Acts of Paul came the nearest to winning canonical
          authority, and received favorable notice from Clement and
          Tertullian.

    7. Summary.

          The New Testament of the Greek and Latin Church of 170-220
          included as in quite definite authority the four Gospels,
          thirteen letters of Paul, Revelation, I Peter, I John (to which
          were attached II and III John), probably also Jude. Up to 210
          the Shepherd was also included. On the other hand, there were
          questionings about James, Hebrews, II Peter, the Apocalypse of
          Peter, the Didache, Barnabas, I and II Clement, Acts of Paul,
          and the Shepherd. The polemic against Marcion, the Gnostics, and
          the Alogi brought the discussion of the New Testament canon to a
          focus about the time of Irenæus and Clement of Alexandria. There
          was yet lacking that definiteness of organization of all the
          churches which alone could secure uniformity. The New Testament
          of about 200 was not the result of a revolution occurring
          150-170, but of a broad development which was many-sided. The
          sharply bounded canon of Marcion had pointed the way to a
          definiteness in canonicity which the Church was soon to follow.

  3. The New Testament, 140-170:

          Valentinus had founded his school which had divided into many
          sections and spread from the Rhone to the Tigris with a rich
          literary activity and yet a general consensus of action. Marcion
          founded his church at Rome after he had separated from the
          catholic Church probably about 147. Alongside the polemic
          against these movements, Christian writers were engaged in the
          apologetic of the Church which was to go before the pagan rulers
          and populations. The apologetic, however, found far less
          occasion to deal with the Christian Scriptures than did the
          writings against the heretics.

    1. Marcion's Bible.

          Knowledge of Marcion's Bible is due chiefly to Tertullian, who
          claimed to use as a weapon against the heretic his own New
          Testament, and so came to traverse the latter from beginning to
          end. After Tertullian as a source of knowledge comes Epiphanius
          (Hær., xlii.), and a number of citations from Greeks and Syrians
          up to the fifth century which enable one to reconstruct quite
          securely Marcion's canon. Marcion issued not only his New
          Testament but also his Antithesis as a defense of his dogmatic
          position and of his critical edition of the New Testament, and
          this became the doctrinal basis of his Church, which was studied
          by Tertullian, Ephraem Syrus, and others. His Bible consisted of
          a "Gospel" and an "Apostle," both anonymous. Since Paul seemed
          to him the one preacher of an unadulterated gospel, his
          "Apostle" embraced ten epistles of Paul and in the following
          order: Gal., I and II Cor., Rom., I and II Thess., Laodioeans
          (i.e., Eph.), Col., Phil., Philem. It is of course evident that
          this collection must have been received by him from the Church.
          He sought to show that the letter to the Ephesians was the
          letter to the Laodiceans mentioned in Col. iv. 16. Galatians he
          especially prized because of the anti-Judaic polemic it
          contains. I and II Tim. and Titus he discarded as private
          letters, Philemon was admitted on the ground that it is a letter
          to a church in a household, and this alone was left intact and
          unedited. For the criticism of the writings he received he
          depended neither upon historic tradition nor on testimonies to
          historicity; his basis was his own subjective conception of what
          true Christianity was and what the Pauline Gospel was; from this
          standpoint proceeded all his text-criticism. That he recognized
          the Gospel of Luke, the basis of his own, as the work of one of
          the Pauline school is shown by his elimination of the words "the
          beloved physician" in Col. iv. 14. His gospel, so far as its
          text can be made out, proves that he had before him the third
          Gospel, and this, in consequence of its long association with
          the first and second Gospels, had received amplifications of its
          text from them. But no trace of influence due to extracanonical
          Gospels upon Marcion has ever been shown. It follows from this
          that the canon of the Gospels of the Church at Rome from about
          140 on was our four Gospels. Marcion's canon of the epistles
          coincides with that of the Muratorian Canon. It is natural that
          he should place no value upon the letters of Peter, John, or
          James, the last named especially in view of Gal. ii. 9, 12. Acts
          and Rev. he appears to have expressly rejected. In comparison
          with the ecclesiastical New Testament not only of his times but
          of the next two centuries with its varying boundaries and its
          variant text, the Marcion canon is a sharply drawn work of art
          in miniature, though it was the work of an arbitrary lawgiver.

    2. The Bible of the Valentinians.

          What Marcion accomplished with knife and eraser the Valentinians
          sought to do by means of exposition. Since they had not
          voluntarily separated from the Church, but merely distinguished
          themselves from the communes ecclesiastici, they had no
          objection to raise to the common edition of the "Prophets and
          Apostles." They needed no special Bible. They used the Gospels
          freely, particularly the Fourth. Apart from the prologue to this
          last, the structure of the series of eons of Valentinus are
          unintelligible. Heraclion commented on all four of the Gospels.
          In the different branches of this sect Eph., Col., and I Cor.
          were especially valued, but Rom., II Con, Phil., and Gal. were
          also used. In their criticism of the Gospels they laid stress
          upon a secret tradition. They used also an Evangelium veritatis,
          a fifth Gospel, which probably contained the sum of apocryphal
          tradition, derived, according to Serapion, not from the Docetes
          but from their precursors. The Gospel of Peter may have arisen
          about 150 from the eastern branch at Antioch as did the
          Evangelium veritatis among the western school of Valentinians.
          To a branch of the Valentinian school of Asia Minor belonged
          Leucius, the author of the Acts of Peter and John. They probably
          used also the Gospel of the Infancy. Leucius wrote also a
          "Journeyings of John," suggested by the "Letters to the Seven
          Churches" of Revelation. In short, the foundation of the canon
          of the most important schools of Gnostics, 140-170, is that of
          the Church of 200, only that these "men of the spirit" used
          alongside of the canonical writings a mass of other traditions
          and poetical and subjective creations which were not employed
          among the orthodox.

    3. The Apostolic Writings in Justin Martyr.

          In his short description of the Sunday service as observed by
          Christians in city and country, Justin names as taking the first
          place the reading of the "Memorabilia of the Apostles," "which
          are called Gospels" (I Apology, lxvi.-lxvii., ANF, i. 185-186),
          and the "collection of the Prophets." "Gospel" in the singular
          is also used by the Jew Trypho and by Justin as a collective.
          Out of deference for his readers who were not acquainted with
          the term "gospel," Justin commonly used the term
          Apomnemoneumata, "Memorabilia." While generally such memorabilia
          took their name from the author, Justin named these from the
          subject, "The Memorabilia of our Savior." As under the term
          "prophets" the whole Old Testament is included, the term
          memorabilia in Justin may include the New Testament writings.
          The answer to the question what gospels are meant has long been,
          those commonly used about 150 in the places Justin visited or
          lived in, in Ephesus and Rome, in the public service and known
          as the product of the Apostles or their disciples. Trypho
          (Dialogue, x.) speaks of the "so-called gospel" as a totality, a
          unit. They can be no other than what Marcion criticized and
          Valentinians so fully employed. In one place Justin expressly
          discriminated between the Apostles and their disciples in a
          passage which goes back to Luke xxii. 44 (Dialogue, ciii.). He
          named the second Gospel "The Recollections of Peter," a
          designation which implies the old tradition of the connection of
          this Gospel with that apostle. What has partly or entirely
          produced the idea that Justin's "memorabilia" are not the
          Gospels of the Church is first the looseness and inexactness of
          quotation, and second the material additions of facts or reports
          grounds for which are not found in the Gospels. But in Justin's
          citations exactness is no more to be expected than in Clement's;
          and much that appears apocryphal to us may have been read in the
          Gospels of his time. Justin regarded Revelation as the work of
          the apostle John and as a true testimony of Christian prophecy.
          Investigation of his writings shows contact of Justin with Rom.,
          I Cor, Gal., Eph., Col., II Thess., Heb., I Pet., Acts and the
          Didache: more questionably with Phil., Titus, I Tim., and James.

  4. The Oldest Traces and the Origin of Collections of Apostolic Writings.

          From the preceding array of facts it appears that by 140 in the
          entire circle of the catholic Church the collection comprising
          the four Gospels and thirteen Epistles of Paul were read
          alongside of the Old Testament writings, and that in one part or
          another of the Church other writings such as Acts, Rev., Heb., I
          Pet., James, and the Epistles of John were held in like honor.

    1. The Collection of Pauline Letters.

          The collection of Pauline letters seems to go back to the first
          century, judging from I Clement, the Ignatian Epistles, and
          Polycarp. The bishops of Smyrna and Antioch had a knowledge of
          Paul which involved acquaintance with his letters, and the way
          in which they employ them shows that the letters were before
          them. Polycarp advised the Philippians to read Paul's letters
          for edification; Ignatius knew Eph. under the title used later
          by Marcion as part of an ecclesiastical collection. Polycarp
          included Phil. and Thess. in a group directed to the Macedonians
          just as Tertullian knew them a century later. Clement seems to
          make the collection begin with I Cor, an order which the
          Muratorian Canon supports, closing with. Rom. This aggregation,
          which contained also the order Phil.-Thess, and the title "to
          the Ephesians," has every claim to originality and to have
          circulated before 97. That there was an interchange of letters
          among the churches before this collection was made is clear from
          Col. iv. 16, but the circulation and use implied in II Pet. iii.
          15 involve a collection in one manuscript, perhaps not official
          but private. The passage last cited implies a Pauline letter to
          Jewish Christians, and I Cor. v. 9 and Phil. iii. 1 imply other
          letters of Paul which have not survived. These facts suggest a
          deliberate selection from the available letters of Paul, made
          probably in some important center of Christianity, which came
          into general use and was seen to be available for public
          service. But the settlement of the order of arrangement implies
          that the collection was made very early, soon after the death of
          Paul. Where this was done can not be stated, though the placing
          of I and II Cor. at the head suggests Corinth. Rome is also to
          be thought of as explaining the closing of this collection with
          the Epistle to the Romans.

    2. The "Gospel."

          The word euaggelion, which, 150-200, designated the collection
          of four Gospels, is frequently found in the earlier literature
          so used that by it must be meant a written exposition of the
          words and deeds of Jesus in possession of the churches and
          generally known to the communities (Didache, viii. 2; 11 Clem.,
          viii. 5; Ignatius, Smyrna, v. 1; Philadelphia, viii. 2). That
          "Gospel" was the authoritative document. The general knowledge
          of its contents involves its regular use in public service. It
          was cited with the formula "the Lord says," with or without the
          addition "in the Gospel," and with the formula (used with Old
          Testament citations) "it is written." But what was this "Gospel
          "? A clear understanding of what it was existed between the
          writers of the period 90-140 and their readers. Papias declared
          that during the lifetime of John in the vicinity of Ephesus a
          Gospel of Mark was used, and Cerinthus, a contemporary of John,
          preferred it to the others (Irenæus, Hær., III. xi. 7, cf. I.
          xxvi. 1). Papias asserted that the Hebrew Matthew was long used
          in the province of Asia with the aid of oral interpretation
          until a Greek version superseded it. Even the Fourth Gospel
          recalls the very words of Mark and Luke (T. Zahn, Einleitung,
          Leipsic, 1900, pp. 505-506, 520). The spurious passage Mark xvi.
          9-20 is derived from Luke, John, and Papias. The earliest
          Gospels of the Infancy and the Gospels of Peter and Marcion go
          back to the canonical Gospels. In the literature of 95-140 among
          a mass of ordinances for ecclesiastical direction only four
          gospel citations are not traceable to the four Gospels (11
          Clem., v. 2, 4, viii. 5, xii. 2-6; Ignatius, Smyrna, iii. 2).
          Such uncanonical sayings as these four were circulated orally as
          well as in writing; Papias about 125 collected many of them. Of
          the origin of the making of the Gospel canon there is no
          trustworthy report, nor can it be said where it took form.

    3. Other Writings.

          Other writings which are found afterward assigned to the New
          Testament were not unified in any one collection as were the
          Gospels and the Pauline Epistles. They appeared first either as
          indisputable or as debated parts of the New Testament in the
          stage it then had reached. A very wide use in extended circles
          of the Church during public service is provable for I Pet., I
          John, Rev., and the Shepherd, none of which was originally
          addressed to a single community.

  5. Origen and His School.

          During the third century the New Testament underwent no
          essential change. The achievement of Origen was the comparison
          of the content of the traditional possession of various
          communities. His varied life and travels gave him the
          opportunity to learn through observation existing variations;
          his philological training and his decided vocation for learned
          work in the service of the Church qualified him to pronounce a
          discreet judgment. Before 217 he was welcomed at Rome as one of
          the rising stars of the Church; his travels took him to Athens,
          Antioch, and Cæsarea in Cappadocia, while his later years were
          spent in Palestine. Students flocked to him both in Alexandria
          and in Palestine. But Bible student though he was, he was no
          thoroughgoing critic. He quoted Prov. xxii. 28 in reference to
          discussion of the canon; tradition spoke for him the last word,
          though indeed that tradition was to be investigated. Hence he
          voiced the distinction between the homologoumena, the writings
          universally recognized as scripture, and the antilegomena, or
          those more or less opposed. To the former, according to Origen,
          belonged the four Gospels, thirteen Pauline Epistles, I Pet., I
          John, Acts, and Rev., the last the closing book of the New
          Testament. To the latter belonged Heb., II Pet., II and III
          John, Jas., Jude, Barnabas, the Shepherd, the Didache, and the
          Gospel of the Hebrews. Hebrews was frequently cited by him as
          though Pauline and canonical, especially in his earlier
          writings; and he defended its Paulinity rather as coming through
          a member of Paul's school than from Paul himself. II Pet. was
          also frequently cited by him as scripture, in which his scholar
          Firmilian followed him. Jas. was also frequently cited both as
          scripture and as "the apostle James." Jude appears to have been
          valued by him, though not often appearing in his writings.
          Barnabas is called a Catholic Epistle and in the Onomasticon is
          put with the other Catholic Epistles. He regarded the Shepherd
          as an inspired work and useful. He appears also to have cited
          the Didache as scripture. The Gospel of the Hebrews is not
          mentioned in his list of the apocryphal gospels; on the other
          hand, it is often cited with the formula he used when citing
          from such writings. He sharply discriminated the
          Jewish-Christian communities, whose one gospel this was, from
          the heretical Ebionites on the ground that the former held fast
          the ecclesiastical rule of faith.

          The allegorical interpretation by means of which Origen
          undertook to reconcile the moat divergent materials and the most
          varied writings and to unite them thus in one Bible found
          opposition. The composition of Nepos, bishop of Arsinoe,
          "Against the Allegorists" advanced and spread a chiliasm which
          to Bishop Dionysius of Alexandria about 260 appeared
          unendurable. To Origen it appeared that Rev. was written by an
          inspired man of the apostolic age named John, but the difference
          in style and conception from the Fourth Gospel did not allow its
          ascription to the apostle. It was especially a book for the
          application of the allegorical method.

  6. The Original New Testament of the Syrians.

          On the beginnings of the church in Edessa there is a legendary
          report in Syriac, The Doctrine of Addai, ed. Phillips, London,
          1876, which contains some significant words about the books
          introduced there for use in the service. Addai, the founder of
          the church of Edessa, is made to say expressly that beside the
          Old Testament no other scriptures shall be read than the Gospel,
          the Epistles of Paul, and the Acts. And by the Gospel is
          doubtless meant the Diatessaron of Tatian. On the other hand,
          Ephraem knew well the four Gospels, and a Syrian canon contained
          not the Diatessaron but the four Gospels in our order. The
          Syrian collection of the Pauline letters embraced, about
          330-370, according to the commentaries of Aphraates and Ephraem,
          Heb. and the apocryphal III Cor., but not Philem. The last-named
          book failed to appear in the otherwise complete commentary of
          Ephraem. A summary from Sinai gives Philem. at the end and does
          not contain III Cor.; on the other hand, it has a II Phil, which
          may be another name for III Cor. It is now known that this
          apocryphal writing is but a section out of the Acts of Paul
          which belongs to the period about 170 at the earliest. It could,
          therefore, not have belonged to the original Syrian Canon.
          Tatian became a Christian at Rome, and, according to the legend,
          the canon of the Epistles was received from Rome. Eusebius
          (Hist. eccl., IV. xxix. 6) heard an obscure report that there
          was a recension of the Pauline Epistles by Tatian. The oldest
          Syrian text both of Epistles and of Gospels has a relationship
          to the Western text. The Sinai summary throws new light on the
          subject. The order of the Epistles there is Gal., I and II Cor.,
          Rom., Heb., and so on, and just this is the order in which
          Ephraem commented upon them and it is the order of Marcion, and
          no one was more likely to follow in the footsteps of Marcion
          than Tatian. It is very remarkable too that in the Syriac
          summary II Tim. is mentioned, but I Tim. is omitted. The Syrian
          Church could not maintain its original individuality. While
          before the time of Aphraates and in the third century it
          received Heb. and I Tim., it could not exclude all the Catholic
          Epistles. The Syriac translation of Eusebius's Church History,
          which Ephraem had diligently read, acquainted the Syrians with
          the older history of the New Testament. Intercourse sprang up in
          the fourth century between Greek and Syrian Christians, and
          Greeks and Greek Bibles appeared in Edessa; it is, therefore, no
          wonder that Ephraem was familiar with all the Catholic Epistles.
          In the Peshito a selection was made of Jas., I Pet., I John,
          while II Pet., II and III John, Jude, and Rev. were excluded.

  7. Lucian and Eusebius.

          While the New Testament of the early Church in Antioch had its
          individuality, the canon of Chrysostom was exactly that of the
          Peshito and carried the exclusion of II and III John back to the
          decision of the Fathers. This can not be due to the efforts of
          Eusebius, since he would set aside the Apocalypse, but would
          recognize the seven Catholic Epistles; to reach the roots of the
          matter, one must go back to the beginning of the exegetical
          school, to Lucian. Report says that Lucian was born in Samosata
          and that he labored in Edessa before he became a priest and the
          founder of the school in Antioch. It is doubtless true that he
          extended his text-critical work to the New Testament, and that
          his recension of that as well as of the Septuagint was diffused
          as far as Constantinople. So that the Antiochean school's text
          of about 380-450 probably goes back to Lucian and was a
          compromise between the Edessan and the Antiochean traditions.
          Rev. was excluded while Jas., I Pet., and I John of the Catholic
          Epistles were taken in. This doubtless influenced the Peshito.

          In Palestine the Bible-studies of Origen were continued by
          Pamphilus and Eusebius. But Eusebius was affected both by the
          Origenistic tradition and by the Antiochean school, with
          representatives of which he was connected in the debate over the
          Trinity. In his Church History according to his promise he has
          diligently given the pronouncements of earlier writers about the
          antilegomena of the New Testament, and also interesting
          information about both acknowledged and doubtful writings. With
          Origen, he found two classes, homologoumena and antilegomena;
          but the second he divided into two subclasses, the one
          containing the books he would have acknowledged and the other
          the notha or "spurious." His table then is: (1) Homologoumena,
          the Gospels, Acts, fourteen Pauline Epistles, I Pet., I John,
          and Rev.; (2) Antilegomena, (a) the better sort, Jas., Jude, II
          and III John, and (b) the notha, Acts of Paul, Shepherd,
          Apocalypse of Peter, Barnabas, and the Didache. But Eusebius's
          treatment is not always either clear or consistent. He uses a
          term endiathekos, "within-the-New-Testament," as a synonym of
          homologoumenos and appears thereby to exclude from the New
          Testament the first class of the antilegomena. On the other
          hand, in naming the second subdivision of the antilegomena
          "spurious" he seems to argue the genuineness of the first
          subdivision. But for him the seven Catholic Epistles are a
          closed collection. It was about Rev. that Eusebius found it hard
          to come to a decision. Many times he cites it and adduces the
          strongest testimony for its ecclesiastical importance (Hist.
          eccl., IV. xviii. 8, xxiv. 1, xxvi. 2, V. viii. 5, xviii. 14,
          VI. xxv. 9). But when in III. xxiv. 18 he reports the
          vacillation of opinion about the book, he calls attention to the
          influence of the Lucian school. He cites it as "the so-called
          Apocalypse of John" (III. xviii. 2, cf. xxxix. 6), briefly
          refers to the vituperation of Caius (III. xxviii.), and notes
          the more cautious criticism of Dionysius (VII. xxiv. 5). His
          conjecture that another John wrote it he follows out with
          diligence, and in the interest of this hypothesis seeks to prove
          the existence of a presbyter John as distinct from the apostle.
          He would disrobe the book of its apostolic dress and remove it
          from the New Testament, though he never expressly utters this
          decision. On account of its quite universal recognition in the
          Church he leaves open the choice between placing it among the
          homologoumena or among the notha. Apart from this book, however,
          his New Testament is the same as ours. The malting of fifty
          copies of the New Testament on parchment for Constantine gave
          him an opportunity to diffuse his opinions, and the result
          showed that he inclined to the Lucian form of text rather than
          to the Origenistic, though including therein the lesser Catholic
          Epistles.

  8. Athanasius.

          According to the Easter Letter of 367, recently recovered
          through a Coptic translation, in which is given a view of the
          continuous undiscriminating usage of all kinds of Apocrypha as
          scripture is the ecclesiastical province where Athanasius was,
          there was afforded him the opportunity of setting forth a
          definitely limited canon arranged in order of books and in
          groups. He was the first to name the twenty-seven books of the
          New Testament as exclusively canonical. He ignored the
          opposition to which several of them had so long been subjected,
          notably II Pet., which Didymus continued to oppose. But not to
          break completely with the Alexandrian tradition, he placed in
          sharp distinction from the "canonized" books and equally from
          the apocryphal ones a class of anagignoskomena. The Fathers had
          designated these as to be placed before the catechumens for
          their instruction. They included Wisd. of Sol., Ecclus., Esther,
          Judith, Tobit, the Didache, and the Shepherd. The Didache had
          great influence upon the liturgy in Egypt, and to the Shepherd
          Athanasius himself attached high value. The surprising element,
          however, is the complete silence concerning other writings which
          at least in Alexandria had equally with the Didache and the
          Shepherd been reckoned with New Testament writings. Serapion,
          the friend of Athanasius, had cited Barnabas as "the most
          honored apostle Barnabas" along with the Romans of Paul, and in
          Codex Sinaiticus it stood between Rev. and the Shepherd. The New
          Testament of twenty-seven books seemed to be as firmly settled
          as that of Eusebius's twenty-six had been. And this view came to
          have the victory in the Church, ruling out finally the shorter
          canon of Eusebius and the use of a class of books merely for the
          instruction of catechumens.

  9. The Development in the Orient till the Time of Justinian.

          The peculiar criticism of Theodore of Mopsuestia did not
          essentially change the situation established by Lucian and
          Eusebius. The concordant testimony of Theodore's opponent
          Leontius and of his admirer Jesudad is that Theodore rejected
          the seven Catholic Epistles. And since as an Antiochean he
          rejected the Apocalypse, his New Testament was the Syrian one of
          about 340. In the arrangement of the Pauline Epistles (Rom., I
          and II Cor., Heb., Eph.) he followed the Syrian usage in respect
          to Heb., and the Greek in respect to Rom. and Gal. He defended
          the canonicity of Philemon, but rejected III Cor. It is no
          wonder that, admired as he was by the Syrian Nestorians, these
          latter adopted his canon. And the Nestorian Jesudad (ninth
          century) still regarded the three greater Catholic Epistles as a
          sort of antilegomena. How tenacious the opposition to the
          Apocalypse was, as also that to the four lesser Catholic
          Epistles, has been shown above. Nevertheless, by the sixth
          century the Apocalypse had won all along the line from Jerusalem
          to Constantinople. If Philoxenus of Mabug, c. 508, had Rev. and
          the lesser Catholic Epistles translated for the first time into
          Syriac, this implies that in the contiguous Greek ecclesiastical
          province, in the patriarchate of Antioch, the Apocalypse was no
          more ignored as it was c. 400, that on the contrary it was again
          received. About the year 500 Andrew wrote in Cæsarea his great
          commentary on the Apocalypse, in which with a certain assiduity
          by appeal to the older teachers from Papias to Cyril he defended
          the inspiration of the book, and in a note on Rev. xxii. 18-19
          assailed the critics. About 530 Leontius designated, in lectures
          delivered in the monastery at Jerusalem, the "Apocalypse of the
          Holy John" as the latest canonical book of the Church.

  10. The Assimilation of the West.

          By the vacillation and the attempts at fixation which the canon
          underwent in the East the Latin Church was not immediately
          affected. Until the fourth century the New Testament there
          excluded Heb., had an incomplete canon of the Catholic Epistles,
          but included the Apocalypse, which was seriously assailed only
          by Caius. The events of the fourth century made isolation
          impossible. The settlement of Pierios, "the new Origen," in Rome
          was a significant preparation. There followed the councils, the
          exile of Athanasius in Trier (336-337), in Rome (340-343), and
          in other parts of the West (till 340); of Hilary of Poitiers in
          Asia Minor (356-360), of Lucifer of Cagliari, Eusebius of
          Vercelli, and others; the long sojourn of Jerome and Rufinus in
          Palestine, Egypt, and Syria, and during this whole period the
          close connection of Latin Church literature, especially of
          exegesis, with Greek models. The ecumenical consciousness of the
          Church overleaped all barriers and affected even the canon. The
          influence of Athanasius in this respect is not to be
          underestimated, especially in connection with the production of
          a recension of the Bible at Rome 340-343.

          Hebrews, prized by the Novatians as a production of Barnabas,
          began after the time of Hilary and Lucifer to be quoted more and
          more in the West as Pauline and, therefore, canonical. The
          growth of sentiment in favor of James took place unnoted, as did
          that of the lesser Catholic Epistles. The African Canon
          (350-365), published by Mommsen, has a more or less official
          air; it makes no mention of Heb., Jas., or Jude, but includes I
          and II Pet., I, II, and III John; but it was corrected by a
          reviser so as to omit II Pet. and II and III John. In a synod of
          c. 382 the controlling spirit was Jerome; so that II and III
          John were received as the presbyter's while the rest of the
          Catholic Epistles were ascribed to Apostles. Hebrews was
          reckoned as a fourteenth Pauline letter. The influence of
          Augustine was dominant in the synods of Hippo (383) and Carthage
          (397), the pronouncement of which was for thirteen Pauline
          Epistles, to which Hebrews was added as a sort of stranger.

          The history of the canon was closed in the West by the beginning
          of the fifth century, a hundred years earlier than in the East.

   Canonical Hours
          CANONICAL HOURS: Certain portions of the day set apart according
          to the rule (canon) of the Church for prayer and devotion. It
          seems likely that the Apostolic Church observed the Jewish
          custom of praying three times a day (Ps. lv. 17: Acts ii. 15,
          iii. 1, x. 30), at the third, sixth, and ninth hour. In the
          fourth century, the zeal of the Psalmist ("

          seven times a day do I praise thee," cxix. 164) was held up for
          Christian imitation by Ambrose, Augustine, and Hilary, and by
          the time of Cassian (d. about 435) it had become a general rule
          of devotion. (See [737]Breviary.) In England the term "canonical
          hours" also refers to the time within which marriage may legally
          be solemnized in a parish church without a license, which was
          from eight to twelve in the morning, until a recent Act of
          Parliament extended it to three in the afternoon.

   Canonization
          CANONIZATION: The process of attributing the title of saint to a
          man or woman already known as "blessed." The word refers to the
          inclusion of the person's name in the list (canon) of the saints
          and recognizing his right to a fitting veneration, which
          includes the setting apart of a day in the ecclesiastical
          calendar for the commemoration of the saint's feast, together
          with an office in the breviary and a mass for the day in his
          honor. To promote the veneration of a saint throughout the
          universal Church, no better method existed than to seek papal
          confirmation of his claims. This probably happened now and then
          even in early times, or the popes gave such confirmation of
          their own motion. We have definite evidence of the formal
          canonization of Bishop Ulric of Augsburg in 993. But
          canonization as a right reserved exclusively to the pope appears
          first under Alexander III. (1159-81). The bishops continued to
          feel justified in canonizing for their own dioceses, until this
          was declared unlawful by Urban VIII, in 1625 and 1634. At
          present a formal and very carefully regulated process is gone
          through before canonization. The candidate, having died in good
          repute, is first designated as "of pious memory," and when a
          regular investigation has been set on foot, as "venerable." If
          it is conclusively shown that he has lived a holy life and
          worked miracles, his beatification may be requested, but
          normally not until fifty years after his death. The process is
          first conducted by the bishop of his home; a commission of the
          Congregation of Rites examines whether it is permissible, in
          which case papal authority to proceed is granted. In order to
          make the necessary demonstration that the candidate possessed
          "heroic" virtues and worked miracles, three separate
          investigations are held--one before the Congregation of Rites,
          one before the whole college of cardinals, and one before a
          consistory held under the pope's presidency. When the pope has
          approved the request, a brief is drawn up which grants the title
          of beatus, and determines the limits of the consequent cultus,
          including commemoration and invocation in public worship, the
          erection of altars, public exposition of relics, and the like.
          The solemn publication of the decree of beatification takes
          place in St. Peter's. After repeated miracles and a similar
          process of investigation, canonization may follow later, with
          still more imposing ceremonies, the pope or his representative
          singing high mass in honor of the new saint. While the
          veneration of the "blessed " is limited to a certain definite
          part of the Roman Catholic Church, that of the saints is
          extended to the entire Church.

   Canstein, Karl Hildebrand, Baron von
          CANSTEIN, c??n´st?in, KARL HILDEBRAND, BARON VON: Founder of the
          Canstein Bible Institute at Halle; b. at Lindenberg (a village
          near fürstenwalde, 21 m. w. of Frankfort) Aug. 4, 1667; d, at
          Berlin Aug. 19, 1719. After completing his legal studies at the
          University of Frankfort-on-the-Oder, in 1686 he traveled through
          Holland, England, France, Italy, and southern Germany, but was
          called to Berlin by the death of the Elector in 1688. In the
          following year he was appointed gentleman of the bed-chamber,
          but resigned after a few years, and enlisted as a volunteer with
          the Brandenburg troops sent to Flanders. There he fell seriously
          ill, was converted, and after recovering his health, returned to
          Berlin, where he lived in retirement, devoting himself to
          philanthropy. In 1691 he became acquainted with Spener, and thus
          formed a lifelong friendship with [738]August Hermann Francke,
          whom he aided in all his enterprises.

          A literary result of Canstein's unceasing study of the Bible was
          his Harmonic und Auslegung der heiligen vier Evangelisten
          (Halle, 1718), but his crowning life-work was his establishment
          of the Canstein Bible Institute. Seeking to make the Scriptures
          known in the widest circles, he expounded his views in a small
          pamphlet entitled Ohnmassgebender Vorschlag, wie Gotteswort den
          Armen zur Erbauung um einen geringen Preis in die Hände zu
          bringen sei (Berlin, 1710), in which he expressed his conviction
          that the use of stereotype plates would render it possible to
          sell copies of the New Testament for two groschen, and of the
          entire Bible for six. His first edition of the New Testament
          appeared at Halle in 1712, and was followed by the entire Bible
          in the next year. Before Canstein's death the New Testament had
          appeared in twenty-eight editions, and the Bible in eight octavo
          and eight duodecimo editions, making a total of about 100,000
          New Testaments and 40,000 Bibles. When the founder died, Francke
          took charge of the Institute. In 1727 the buildings were
          enlarged, and in 1734-35 the Cansteinische Buckdruckerei was
          established. The Bible was printed in Bohemian and Polish in
          1722, and in 1868-69 versions in Wendish and Lithuanian
          appeared. The revised text of Luther's version was also first
          printed by this Institute (Halle, 1892). See [739]Bible

   Canterbury
          CANTERBURY: The ancient metropolitan see of England. The city is
          of great antiquity, succeeding the British village of Durwhern,
          the Roman Durovernum, and the Saxon Cantwarabyrig. Augustine,
          sent from Rome by Gregory the Great in 596 to convert the
          Anglo-Saxons, made it the headquarters of his missionary
          activity; but it was not until the episcopate of the great
          organizer Theodore of Tarsus (668-690) that the claim of the see
          to metropolitan jurisdiction over the whole of England was
          acknowledged by the other bishops and confirmed by Pope
          Vitalian. This authority extended over Ireland as well until the
          elevation of the see of [741]Armagh to primatial rights. Owing,
          however, to the important position of York in the north of
          England, the archbishops of that see for a long time contested
          the first place with Canterbury, and it was not until the
          pontificate of Alexander III. (1159-81) that the latter enjoyed
          an unquestioned primacy. Among the long line of archbishops some
          distinguished names occur: Dunstan (959-988); Ælfheah martyred
          by the Danes (1006-12); Lanfranc (1070-89) and Anselm
          (1093-1109), the great defenders of the rights of the Church and
          people against the first Norman kings; Thomas Becket (1162-70),
          murdered in the cathedral itself for his resistance to the
          king's encroachments; Stephen Langton (1207-28). William Warham
          (1503-32) was, with the exception of the two years' tenure of
          the see by Cardinal Pole under Mary (1556-58), the last Roman
          Catholic archbishop. Thomas Cranmer (1533-56) begins the
          Anglican succession, followed by Parker, Grindal, and Whitgift
          under Queen Elizabeth. William Laud (1633-45) kept up the
          earlier traditions of the see by giving his life for his
          principles; but in the post-Reformation annals few names of
          great significance occur--though Archbishops Tait, Benson, and
          Temple in the latter half of the nineteenth century were men of
          broad and statesmanlike abilities. The archbishop of Canterbury
          ranks as the first peer of the realm after the princes of the
          blood royal, and has the right to crown the sovereign and to
          other secular prerogatives. The cathedral in its present shape
          was begun by Lanfranc on the site of St. Augustine's monastery;
          it contains work extending from his time to that of Prior
          Goldstone in the fifteenth century, thus exhibiting specimens of
          all schools of Gothic, and affording the best guide to the study
          of the development of architecture in England. From the death of
          Becket until the Reformation, it was a favorite place of
          pilgrimage. His body, brought from the crypt, was placed in 1220
          in a shrine of such magnificence that Erasmus, who visited it in
          1512, recorded that "gold was the meanest thing to be seen." In
          1538 Henry VIII. destroyed the shrine, as that of a rebel
          against royal authority, and confiscated its treasures. Among
          the other interesting ecclesiastical remains in Canterbury are
          St. Martin's church, said to be the oldest in England and to
          date in part from the period of the Roman occupation, and the
          first house of the Dominicans in England. See the biographical
          notices of Augustine, Theodore, and other archbishops of
          Canterbury; also the articles [742]Anglo-Saxons, Conversion of
          the; [743]Celtic Church in Britain and Ireland; [744]England,

   Cantor
          CANTOR: A name applied in the early Church to those who were
          specially set apart to conduct the singing. They are mentioned
          as a special class in the Apostolic Constitutions and in the
          canons of the Council of Laodicea (365), and were set apart by
          the clergy with a particular rite. In the later Western Church
          the name was also applied in cathedrals and collegiate churches
          to one of the canons who had the oversight of the musical
          instruction of the younger members and led the musical part of
          the service; called also precentor. It is sometimes used quite
          generally for specially designated singers, whether clerical or
          lay, who intone or begin the psalms, antiphons, and hymns.

   Capecelatro, Alfonso
          CAPECELATRO, c??-pê´´chê-l??´trO, ALFONSO: Cardinal priest; b.
          at Marseilles Feb. 5, 1824. He entered the oratory of St. Philip
          Neri, and in 1878 was appointed sublibrarian of the Holy See.
          Two years later he was consecrated archbishop of Capua, and in
          1885 was created cardinal priest of Santi Nereo ed Achilleo. In
          the following year, however, he chose the church of Santa Maria
          del Popolo in preference to that of Santi Nereo ed Achilleo. He
          still retains his archiepiscopal see, and also remains the
          official librarian of the Holy See. In addition to a number of
          briefer contributions, he has written: Storia di Santa Caterina
          e del papato del suo tempore (2 vols., Naples, 1856); Newman e
          la religione cattolica in Inghilterra (2 vols., 1859); La vita
          di Gesù Cristo (1862); Storia di San Pier Damiano e del suo
          tempore (Florence, 1862); Scritti Vari religiosi e sociali (3d

          Sienna, 1879); Vita di San Filippo Neri (2 vols., Naples, 1879;
          Eng. transl., by T. A. Pope, London, 1882); Prose sacre e morale
          (Sienna, 1884); and Nuove Prose (2 vols., Milan, 1899). An
          edition of his works was published in eighteen volumes at Rome
          in 1886-93.

   Cape Colony
          CAPE COLONY: The most important of the British possessions in
          South Africa, comprising, in general, that portion of the
          continent south of the Orange River; area, 277,000 square miles;
          population (1904), 2,409,804, of whom less than one-fourth (not
          quite 580,000) are Europeans or whites; the remainder (still
          predominantly heathen) includes 1,114,100 Kafirs and Bechuanas,
          310,720 half-breeds classed as Fingo stock, 91,260 Hottentots,
          15,680 Malays, and 298,340 classed as half-breeds and of
          miscellaneous origin.

          The more important religious bodies of the colony are as
          follows: (1) The Dutch Reformed Church, with 399,500 members
          (1904), of whom 296,800 were white. It is the church of the
          original European (Dutch) settlers, who spread widely through
          the land by conquest from 1652 onward. Their Church is governed
          by a general synod, whose sessions are held every three years.
          The separate congregation is administered by a church council
          (kerkeraad), and six to twelve congregations constitute a
          congregational circuit ("ring"), whose chosen representatives
          become members of the General Synod. A standing committee of the
          Synod administers the principal affairs of the Church as a
          whole. The colored congregations are for the most part the
          result of missionary labor; only a small number of their clergy
          have a higher education. (2) The Church of England, 281,440
          members (122,560 white). The diocese of Cape Town was founded in
          1847; the incumbent has borne the title of archbishop since 1897
          and is metropolitan of the province of South Africa, which
          comprises nine dioceses besides the metropolitan see, viz.:
          Bloemfontein (formerly the Orange Free State, formed 1863),
          Grahamstown (1853), Lebombo (1891), Mashonaland (1891), Natal
          (formerly Maritzburg, 1853), Pretoria (1878), St. Helena (1859),
          St. John's, Kaffraria (1873), and Zululand (a missionary
          bishopric, 1870). (3) The Wesleyan Methodist Church of South
          Africa, 277,300 members (35,900 white). This body very early
          employed colored teachers and has applied less rigorous tests of
          conversion than others; in 1891 it had about 1,250 lay helpers.
          Two other Methodist bodies have an inconsiderable aggregate
          membership. (4) Congregationalists, 112,200 members (5,000
          Europeans), for the most part connected with the London
          Missionary Society. The Congregational Union of South Africa was
          formed in 1900 from the Union of South Africa (1877) and the
          Union of Natal and Southeastern Africa (1882). (5)
          Presbyterians, 88,660 members (26,360 of European origin). The
          Scotch Church began missionary activity in the east of the
          colony in 1821. (6) Lutherans, 37,050 members (13,100
          Europeans), mostly of German origin. They are united in the
          German Evangelical Lutheran Synod of South Africa. (7) The
          Rhenish Mission Church has 20,800 members and (8) the Moravians
          23,100, nearly all colored. (9) The African Methodist Episcopal
          Church has 12,060 members; (10) the Baptists number 14,100, of
          whom 9,950 are white, their congregations being organized
          practically on a European basis; (11) the Church of Christ has
          7,600 members (1,075 Europeans), and (12) the South African
          Reformed Church 6,210, nearly all Europeans. Further, there is a
          group of mission congregations, of which the largest is Dutch
          (4,790) and the smallest American (215), and more than forty
          additional sects or denominations witness the tendency to
          religious division which manifests itself in English-speaking
          lands. For further information concerning missionary activity,
          see [748]Africa, II.

          The Roman Catholic Church has had a vigorous growth in the last
          ten years, and now counts more than 37,000 members (28,500 of
          European origin). The organization includes the apostolic
          vicariates of western and eastern Cape Colony, dating
          respectively from 1837 and 1847, with residence at Cape Town and
          Port Elizabeth, and the apostolic prefecture of central Cape
          Colony (1874), with residence at Cape Town. The Roman Catholic
          Church is active throughout South Africa and has established
          vicariates for Natal (1850), the Transvaal (1904), and Orange
          Free State (1886), and a prefecture of Basutoland (1894).

          The Greek Orthodox Church reckons 1,050 adherents, almost
          exclusively European. The Israelites have decreased on account
          of emigration; still 19,500 remain. Mohammedanism is represented
          by 22,630 members (among them 15,100 Malays), and 2,035 Hindus
          are enumerated. In spite of the missionary zeal of so many
          Christian sects, more than half the natives continue in
          heathenism, the official figures of colored heathen being
          1,015,230.

          The number of illiterates, after deduction of children under
          school age, is 1,368,000. The religious bodies are engaged in
          active rivalry to meet the needs of education and thereby to
          increase their numbers, and the government has latterly applied
          itself to the building and equipment of schools on a scale of
          greatly increased expenditure. Attendance at school was made
          compulsory in 1905.

          CAPEN, ELMER HEWITT: Universalist; b. at Stoughton, Mass., Apr.
          5, 1838; d. at Medford, Mass., Mar. 22, 1905. He was graduated
          at Tufts College, 1860; admitted to the bar, 1863; was pastor of
          the Independent (Universalist) Christian Society of Gloucester,
          Mass., 1865-69; of the First Universalist Church of Providence,
          R. I., 1870-75; and after 1875 president of Tufts College,
          Medford, Mass. He belonged to the school of Universalists who
          make the final triumph of good over evil a corollary of the
          nature of God--a result to be wrought out through those moral
          processes which are seen in operation around us. He was member
          of the legislature from Stoughton, 1859-60. His publications
          consisted of sermons, addresses, reports, etc.

   Capernaum
          CAPERNAUM, c?-per´n?-Um: The name of a Galilean city, situated
          near the Sea of Galilee. The form of the word follows the textus
          receptus, though the best manuscripts give Capharnaum. It is a
          compound name meaning "village of Nahum" or "of consolation."
          Jesus made it the center of his Galilean activities and it was
          called "his own city" (Matt. iv. 13, ix. 1); his disciples Simon
          Peter and Andrew had a house there; he taught in the synagogue
          there, in Peter's house, and on the seashore, and performed a
          number of wonderful cures. There he obtained his disciples
          Peter, Andrew, and Levi-Matthew, and near-by James and John
          (Mark i. 16-17, 19, ii. 14). The city lay on the west shore of
          the sea, had a customs-office and royal collector and a garrison
          in command of a captain who was a friend of the Jews and had
          built them a synagogue. Josephus in describing the plain of
          Gennesaret (War, III. x. 8) speaks of a copious spring watering
          the plain which was called by the inhabitants Capernaum. There
          are still near the north of the plain two springs. One of these,
          the Ain-el-Tine, issues from the rock under the roots of a
          fig-tree not far from Khan Minyeh. But this can not be the one
          meant by Josephus, since it lies too low to water the plain. The
          other lies northwest of the first and outside the boundaries of
          the plain. This is the most copious spring in Galilee, stronger
          by far than the Banias source of the Jordan, known now as
          Ain-el-Tabigah, the waters of which are collected in a hexagonal
          reservoir of old masonry, showing that the spring was used for
          irrigation purposes. This is doubtless the spring mentioned by
          Josephus, and Capernaum must have been in the neighborhood, and,
          like the spring, not within the limits of the plain. Josephus
          states (Life, lxxii.), that in a skirmish against the troops of
          Agrippa II. which took place on the banks of the Jordan, he was
          thrown from his horse and wounded, and had himself carried to
          the village Cepharnome and in the following night to Taricheæ.
          In spite of different textual readings of the name of the place,
          it is probable that Josephus here meant Capernaum.

          Eusebius (Onomasticon, 273) discusses "in the borders of Zebulun
          and Naphtali" of Matt. iv. 13 in connection with Isa. ix. 1. The
          meaning of the phrase is "in the district of," not "on the
          boundary of." With Tel-Hum goes well Jerome's statement of two
          Roman miles as the distance between Chorazin and Capernaum (the
          "twelve miles" of Eusebius seems a copyist's error). Put
          alongside the foregoing that Capernaum and Bethsaida were
          adjacent (Epiphanius, Hær., 1. 15), and early reports are quite
          exhausted.

          Tel-Hum is the one old site in the vicinity of the spring, forty
          minutes distant in a northwestern direction. E. Robinson in 1838
          visited and described the ruins, some quite pretentious
          buildings, of black basalt and limestone, among which travelers
          have thought they identified the remains of a synagogue. The
          name of the fountain, even though forty minutes away, makes for
          the identification of Tel-Hum with Capernaum. And the form
          Tel-Hum may be an Arabic variation for Tenhum, abbreviated from
          the Talmudic Kaf Tanhumim ("Village of Consolation").

          The Franciscan Quaresmio in 1616-26 identified Khan Minyeh near
          Ain-el-Tine as the site of Capernaum, and he has been followed
          by many scholars. On this site appear the traces of the larger
          streets which a garrison city seems to require. A conclusion has
          been urged that John vi. 1-21 and Mark vi. 45-53 imply that
          Capernaum was on the plain of Gennesaret, but this falls after
          close examination of the passages. Arguments drawn from the
          element "Minyeh" in the modern name have also no cogency.

          The ruins of Tel-Hum belong now to the Franciscans, who have
          enclosed them with a wall, intending to excavate there in the
          future.

          which he attained the rank of brigadier-general. From the close
          of the war until 1868 he was secretary of the South Carolina
          Legislature, but in the mean time studied theology, and was
          ordained to the priesthood in 1867. He was then rector of Christ
          Church, Greenville, S. C., 1867-87, except for a year (1875-76)

          of South Carolina.

   Caphtor
          CAPHTOR, caf´ter: A locality provisionally identified with
          Crete, though the question can not be regarded as settled.
          According to Amos ix. 7 it was the original home of the
          Philistines; Jer. xlvii. 4 (Masoretic text) makes of it an
          island or coast-land; Deut. ii. 23 and Gen. x. 14 use the term
          "Caphtorim" of the inhabitants. The early tradition is indicated
          by the fact that the Septuagint, Vulgate, Peshito, and Targums
          use "Cappadocia" and "Cappadocians" in Amos ix. 7 and Deut. ii.
          23; this was based, however, on a misunderstanding. Attempts to
          find the meaning have been made by investigating the word
          "Cherethites" (I Sam. xxx. 14-16; Zeph. ii. 5; Ezek. xxv. 16),
          used of a people in the Philistine region and of Philistine
          stock. The transliterations of the Hebrew in the Septuagint show
          that the latter did not understand the meaning. In the
          prophetical books the form Kretes is used by the Septuagint,
          implying immigration from Crete; but how far this rested upon
          data known to the interpreters is indeterminable.

          On Egyptian monuments of the time of Thothmes III. appears
          mention of a land the name of which takes a form corresponding
          to "Caphtor" minus the final consonant (Kefti ). Ebers explained
          this by "Phenicians," only to have the explanation shown
          untenable by W. Max Müller. According to G. Steindorff, the
          Egyptian word connotes "islands of the Ægean"; and the same
          authority notes among the representations of tribute to Thothmes
          III. from the Kefti vessels of the Mycenæan type of about
          1450-1250 B.C. The Kefti must have been within the sphere of
          influence of Mycenæan culture. But Müller connects them with
          Cilicia. Evans in his investigations in Crete has discovered
          numerous evidences of the existence there of Mycenæan culture,
          thus bringing Crete within the sphere of influence of that
          civilization. Alongside of them are articles of Egyptian
          workmanship, showing exchange of commodities between Egypt and
          Crete. Steindorff puts the two facts together, and equates Crete
          and the Egyptian Kefti. But this may prove superfluous provided
          success is attained in geographically defining the word kptar
          recently found at Ombos, a word which closely corresponds with
          the Hebrew Caphtor. The equation Kefti = kptar is not fully
          proved.

   Capistrano, Giovanni di
          CAPISTRANO, GIOVANNI DI: Franciscan; b. at Capistrano (22 m.
          s.e. of Aquila), in the Abruzzi, 1386; d. at Illok (Ujlak, 26 m.
          w. of Peterwardein), Slavonia, Oct. 23, 1456. He first studied
          jurisprudence, but joined the Franciscans in 1416 and in the
          school of Bernardin of Sienna became a theologian and preacher.
          After 1426 he acted as inquisitor against the Fratricelli and
          Jews, and by cruel measures attained a moderate success. His
          main achievement was the defense and extension of the order of
          the Observantines, of whom he was made vicar-general in Italy in
          1446. In 1451 he was sent to Germany against the Hussites.
          Followed by large crowds, he went to Vienna, and is reported to
          have performed 320 miracles on the way, while the number of his
          hearers is said to have increased from 150 to 300,000. He
          intended now to go to Bohemia to destroy the heresy there; a
          disputation to which he was invited by the Utraquist bishop
          Rokyczana he managed to avoid, and finally he did venture to
          enter the country. Æneas Silvius states that he did, indeed,
          convert a few Hussites, but, considering the multitude of the
          heretics, they are hardly worth mentioning. At any rate Bohemia,
          in spite of his sermons, remained as it was before. By way of
          Bavaria, Saxony, and Lusatia, he went to Silesia and Poland, and
          on account of his sermons and miracles was everywhere revered
          like a saint. After the fall of Constantinople (1453) he tried
          to induce the princes of Germany at the Diets of Frankfort and
          Wiener-Neustadt to make war against the Turks, but failed, and
          was very little successful generally in preaching the cross. He
          went to Hungary in 1455 and when Mohammed II. advanced against
          Belgrade (1456) Capistrano, the papal legate Carjaval, and John
          Hunyadi were almost the only men who bestirred themselves to
          repel the foe. In spite of his age, Capistrano with a number of
          crusaders went to Belgrade and by a daring sally gave Hunyadi
          opportunity to beat the Turks. For this the friends of his order
          have celebrated him as savior of Europe. He died soon after,
          exhausted by hardships. Although revered in his lifetime as a
          saint, he was not canonized until 1690. Prominent
          contemporaries, among them the subsequent pope Pius II.,
          expressed some doubts as to his miracles and had no favorable
          opinion of him because of his bragging self-glorification and
          choleric irritability.

  I. The Historical Development of Capital Punishment.

    1. In Primitive Society.

          It must be borne in mind that the killing of a person guilty of
          grievous crime does not, in primitive society, belong to the
          class of deliberate ordinances enacted by the community. It is
          rather a form of the impulse of revenge, which the primitive
          institutions of all the older civilized nations first tolerate,
          and then regulate and uphold or limit (see [752]Blood-Revenge).
          In primitive conditions revenge has a twofold operation. It is
          directed in some cases against offenses which affect the
          individual or the family (such as theft, adultery, and the
          murder of a freeman); in these cases the injured family proceeds
          against the offender or his family, and the community takes part
          only in the interests of public peace, by establishing a penalty
          on payment of which the offender is to be safe from revenge.
          Quite a different form of procedure is that against crimes which
          offend the consciousness of the whole community (sacrilege,
          unnatural vices, treason in war, etc.). Here the vengeance of
          the community is provoked, and it acts first by formal delivery
          of the offender to the will of the members or outlawry, then
          later by actual execution, in connection with which sacred
          ceremonies analogous to those of sacrifice are often found. As
          organized government grows stronger, it takes an official
          interest in crimes which were originally in the private sphere,
          withdraws them from individual vengeance, and subjects them to
          capital punishment. Religion has its influence here; the
          interference of government in such cases is usually, brought
          about by the conception that the crime, apart from the injury to
          the immediate victims, defiles the community and must be
          punished in order to retain peace with the deity. This can be
          clearly shown in the Greek law of the post-Homeric age, less
          clearly but still probably in ancient Roman law; and the same
          course was followed in Hebrew history. In the primitive law (cf.
          Ex. xxi. 12 sqq.) the murderer is exposed to the pursuit of the
          avenger of blood, and the elders of the community cooperate only
          to the extent of driving the fugitive from an asylum and
          delivering him to the avenger. In the case of the other crimes
          mentioned in Ex. xxi. the punishment of death is either private
          vengeance, or at most a sort of tribal vengeance or lynch law.
          As late as the period of Deut. xix. the blood-vengeance is
          mentioned; but by the side of it appears the idea that the whole
          community is affected with blood-guiltiness by a deliberate
          murder, and must be purified by the death of the offender. The
          same law began, when priestly influence increasingly dominated
          all departments of life, to be applied to other offenders
          (blasphemers, traitors, adulterers, etc.). The formal
          abandonment to the avenger was replaced by stoning, in which all
          the men of the community took part.

    2. In Roman Law.

          In so far as the religious influence remained a permanent factor
          in the penal code, the Jewish State stands alone among the
          Mediterranean communities. In the others, especially the Greek
          and Roman, punishment became exclusively a matter of secular
          enactment. In the Roman the principle is continuously applied
          from the fifth century that the death penalty (whether by
          decapitation, burning, or throwing down a precipice) is due to
          all grave crimes (including murder, arson, perjury, treason,
          etc.); but in practise this was mitigated by the frequent
          substitution of the "interdiction of fire and water," i.e.,
          banishment from the community, especially after the introduction
          of the provocatio ad populum, an appeal to the whole body of the
          people against the decision of consuls and other magistrates
          empowered to pronounce sentence of outlawry. In the last two
          centuries of the republic capital punishment was seldom applied,
          to members of the upper classes at least. But it was never
          abolished, and when the reorganization of the Roman system took
          place under imperial legislation it was again more frequently
          employed, even against Roman citizens. Thus at the beginning of
          the Christian era it was an accepted institution throughout the
          Roman Empire, though with variations in usage due to local law.
          The teaching of Christ made no substantial alteration in these
          conditions. Of his own recorded sayings, the only one directly
          bearing on the subject is Matt. xxvi. 52, which (like Gen. ix.
          5) refers rather to the eternal working out of the divine
          justice in the abstract. But Paul speaks expressly in Rom. xiii.
          1 sqq. of the legal death-penalty--although here it is merely
          designated as reconcilable with the divine law, not required or
          imposed as a duty upon the State. Accordingly Christian teaching
          made no change in the Roman law, and, when the Christians became
          dominant, after having been for two centuries frequent victims
          to its provisions, they still allowed it to take free course. In
          fact, it was applied with increasing frequency even to Roman
          citizens of the higher classes, and from the time of Constantine
          to a large number of minor offenses.

    3. Attitude of the Church.

          Although the Church was more firmly and fully organized when it
          came into contact with the institutions of the new Germanic
          kingdoms, and assumed the right of extensive interference with
          their penal legislation on principles resembling those of the
          Jewish theocracy, its influence in the question of capital
          punishment was not decisive. Germanic law at first, like all
          primitive systems, made private vengeance and the mitigation of
          it by surrender of property on the part of the offender the
          principal factor in the punishment of crime. The Church
          undertook to regulate this to the extent of minimizing private
          vendettas, both by providing and supporting means of
          reconciliation between the contending parties and by
          strengthening orderly official justice. But in spite of the
          "horror of bloodshed" consistently emphasized by the Church,
          which from the tenth century on created an impressive mechanism
          against private vendettas in the [753]Truce of God, it was
          obliged to give a general support to the gradual upbuilding of
          the secular system of corporal, including capital, punishment in
          the kingdoms of western Europe. When the death-penalty had been
          finally established as a regular part of settled secular law,
          the Church in theory took the position of a simple spectator of
          its exercise. It forbade the clergy to take any part in its
          administration, laid down the principle Ecclesia non sitit
          sanguinem ("The Church does not thirst for blood"), and
          admonished ecclesiastical authorities to provide asylums and in
          other ways to work for mercy to the offender in the hope of his
          improvement. This position was somewhat modified when the war
          against heresy began. Even in the eleventh century the State
          threatened heretics with death in isolated cases in France and
          Germany; and by the middle of the twelfth century the growth of
          heresy led to a formal alliance between Church and State, by
          which Frederick Barbarossa in 1184, and then other sovereigns of
          southern Europe, pledged the pope the support of the secular arm
          for the suppression of heresy. The penalties were at first
          outlawry, infamy, and confiscation of goods; but in 1224
          Frederick II. approved of death by fire as the penalty in
          Lombardy; and this penalty, soon applied throughout Italy, was
          not only sanctioned but directly called for by Gregory IX. It
          was not long before the new principle was extended to Germany,
          France, England, and Spain, and the death-penalty, while
          theoretically administered by secular officials, was actually
          the consequence of an ecclesiastical condemnation.

          The teaching of the Reformers brought about no essential
          alteration in the general attitude toward capital punishment; it
          might seem that the Reformation strengthened the institution,
          but really this attitude is rather the result of contemporary
          conditions. The death-penalty had been more frequently employed
          in all European states since the fifteenth century as a result
          of violent proletarian risings and the increase of the dangerous
          unemployed and vagabond population, and the period from 1530 to
          1630 is that in which the number of executions reached its
          high-water mark. When a reaction came about, it was directed
          primarily against an excessive use of this penalty, and then
          toward the establishment of penitentiaries (London 1580,
          Amsterdam 1596, Hamburg 1622, etc.), which brought about a
          decrease in the number of executions. The movement for the
          abolition of capital punishment did not proceed from a religious
          source. While Locke, Voltaire, Montesquieu, and Thomasius had
          all recognized it as a necessary part of the social system, and
          Rousseau in the Contrat social had left it theoretically free
          play, it was Cesare Beccaria in 1764 who, as a deduction from
          Rousseau's general ideas, proclaimed its irreconcilability with
          abstract justice. In modern times no agreement has been reached
          on the basis of religious convictions.

  II. Place of Religious Ideas in the Question.

          The historical outline given above shows clearly that the
          sanction and province of capital punishment in secular law can
          not be brought directly under religious control. The old
          philosophical doctrine of the "Christian State" is now no longer
          recognized. On modern principles, the State's justification for
          existence lies in its necessity to the unhampered development of
          human activity; and on this rests its power of punishing, and in
          particular its right to apply the death-penalty. The essential
          characteristics of a just and proper punishment will thus have
          to be determined by a course of empirical historical research.

          In the older development of the penal code of all nations,
          corporal punishment is found concurrently with penalties
          affecting the property of the offender; but the corporal is
          finally preferred because it is capable of application alike to
          all, while money fines have a varying effect according to the
          wealth of the offender. By degrees the permission of compounding
          for corporal penalties is abolished, with the gradual building
          up from the twelfth century of modern principles of government.
          The death-penalty is increasingly preferred as emphasizing the
          thought of the equality of all men before the law. It is misused
          for a time as the easiest way of ridding society of dangerous
          persons, and then, in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries,
          the question is widely discussed how far it ought properly to be
          applied, sad the principle of justice is urged in favor of its
          restriction to very grave crimes. These arguments, however,
          produced no great effect until the reaction from the excessive
          use of it led to the creation of a third form of penalty in a
          regular system of imprisonment, thoroughly established about
          1700. The considerations which moved John Howard and others in
          the' eighteenth century to agitate for prison reform on the
          ground of humanity led also to the more frequent discussion of
          the desirability of abolishing capital punishment, and finally
          to an almost universal recognition of the sole ground on which
          its maintenance can be defended. It is now admitted that on
          grounds of humanity the State has no right to annihilate the
          individual existence, and that so far as these grounds go, the
          heaviest penalty that may be inflicted is that of penal
          servitude for life. From the standpoint, however, of abstract
          justice, it is still possible to defend the death-penalty, not
          in the interest of terrifying offenders, nor yet on the basis of
          a lex talionis, but on that of a proportion between crime and
          penalty, which may fairly demand that the severity of the
          punishment shall correspond in some measure to the importance of
          the social function injured by the crime. With this is connected
          the requirement that the penalty shall be impressive--as much so
          as the crime--in order that the authority of the law shall be
          upheld, and equal, falling with the same severity on all classes
          of the community. The validity of this argument will be denied
          by those who reject the principle of equivalent compensation
          and, taking their stand exclusively on the principle of
          humanity, seek as the result of punishment the amelioration of
          the offender and the deterrence of him from any further crimes.
          But the fact that many of those who take this theoretical view
          acquiesce in the retention of capital punishment in practise
          shows that the traditional verdict of many centuries as to the
          relation of crime and punishment is still to be reckoned with in
          any discussion of this question.

  III. Capital Punishment in Modern Times.

          In modern times the maintenance or abolition of the
          death-penalty has been considered mainly from the standpoint of
          social utility and social justice. In the history of penology
          the influence of Christian and humane sentiments has been
          distinctly felt; but many drastic punishments have been laid
          aside, not because they were cruel and severe, but because they
          were ineffective. As mutilation has been practically abandoned
          in civilized countries, so reliance upon capital punishment as a
          means of repressing crime has been greatly weakened. A
          conclusive proof of this is seen in the restriction of the
          number of offenses to which it is applied. Scarcely more than a
          century ago 200 offenses were included in the list of capital
          crime in England. Until 1894 twenty-five offenses were made
          capital under the military code of the United States, twenty-two
          under the naval code, and seventeen under the penal code. Under
          Federal laws the number of capital offenses has now been reduced
          to three. Many advocates of capital punishment today are willing
          to limit its application wholly to cases of murder.

          Publicity was formerly regarded as absolutely necessary for the
          deterrent effect of executions. Even after death the body of the
          criminal was exposed for weeks on the gibbet as a warning to
          malefactors. The practise of gibbeting has now been abandoned,
          and the practise of public execution is gradually following it.
          Within recent years seven or eight States of the Union,
          including New York, Massachusetts, New Mexico, North Dakota,
          have decided that attendance on executions should be limited to
          a number of legal or specified witnesses. The governors of
          Georgia and Kentucky have recommended similar legislation. In
          several States the electric chair has been substituted for the
          gallows with a view of mercifully rendering death instantaneous.
          Other States of the Union have abolished the death-penalty
          altogether. Michigan abolished it in 1847, Rhode Island in 1852,
          Wisconsin in 1853. Maine abolished it in 1876, restored it in
          1883, and again abolished it in 1887. In 1903 New Hampshire
          abolished the death-penalty for murder in the first degree
          unless the jury should have fixed the same to the verdict;
          otherwise the sentence is for life imprisonment. In Kansas there
          have been no official executions since 1872, as no governor has
          exercised his power to order the execution of a prisoner. In
          1907 the legislature amended the law by substituting life
          imprisonment for the death-penalty. The governor of Nebraska in
          1903 urged the legislature to abolish capital punishment.
          Colorado abolished the death-penalty in 1897, but restored it
          1901, as a result of a lynching outbreak in 1900.

          In its session 1906-07 the subject of the abolition of capital
          punishment occupied a prominent place in the discussions of the
          French parliament without final result. Russia, one of the first
          countries to respond to the appeal of Beccaria, abolished it in
          1753, except for political offenses. It was abolished in
          Portugal in 1867, in Holland in 1870, in Italy in 1890; and it
          has been abolished in the majority of the Swiss cantons, in
          Costa Rica, Brazil, Ecuador, Guatemala, Venezuela, and three
          states of Mexico. Some countries which have not formally
          abolished it by legislative act have suppressed it in practise.
          This is true of Belgium, and of some states of Mexico. It
          remains yet to be proven that an increase in capital crimes has
          followed the abolition of the death-penalty in any country. On
          the contrary, the higher development of civilization in these
          countries, the growth of the, humane sentiment, and increased
          reliance upon educational and preventive measures, instead of
          upon drastic deterrent laws, have led to a gradual reduction of
          crimes of violence.

   Capito, Wolfgang Fabricius
          CAPITO, WOLFGANG FABRICIUS: Reformer at Strasburg; b. at
          Hagenau) 16 m. n. of Strasburg) 1478; d. at Strasburg Nov.,
          1541. He was the son of a blacksmith named Koepfel, whence the
          Latin name Capito. Having passed the schools at Pforzheim and
          Ingolstadt, he studied at Freiburg first medicine, then law, and
          finally theology. In 1512 he became parish priest at Bruchsal
          and there made the acquaintance of OEcolampadius and Pellican.
          Called to Basel in 1515 as preacher and professor, he became
          intimate with the humanists, including Erasmus, and, abandoning
          scholasticism, betook himself to the study of the Bible. He
          published the Psalter in the original (1516), became personally
          acquainted with Zwingli and from 1518 corresponded with Luther.
          Contrary to all expectation, he was appointed in 1519 chaplain
          to Albert, elector and archbishop of Mainz. For a time he tried
          to mediate with humanistic liberality between the elector and
          Luther, but in 1522 he was brought over completely to the cause
          of the Reformation, and resigned his position at Mainz. In May,
          1523, he went to Strasburg and as provost of St. Thomas (a
          position obtained by the favor of Leo X.) preached in accordance
          with his conviction. In 1524 he married and became pastor of the
          Jung-St. Petergemeinde. From this time on, he belonged, with
          Butzer and the burgomaster Jacob Sturm, to the leaders of the
          Strasburg Reformation. In his Kinderbericht (1527 and 1529) he
          prepared a catechism, which, by its peculiar arrangement and
          characteristic treatment of the matter, forms a noteworthy
          pendant to Luther's contemporaneous smaller catechism. With
          Butzer, Capito prepared the Confessio Tetrapolitana (1530). His
          most important reformatory work is the Berner Synodus, the
          result of the synod held at Bern in 1532, a kind of
          church-discipline and pastoral instruction, distinguished by
          apostolic power and unction, great simplicity, and practical
          wisdom. He took an active part in Butzer's efforts to bring
          together the Evangelicals of Germany, France, and Switzerland.
          He also had part in bringing about the Wittenberg Concordia of
          1536. Toward the Anabaptists and other sectaries who disturbed
          the church at Strasburg he was more friendly and confiding than
          Butzer, and for a time sided with them, thus destroying the good
          understanding between himself and Butzer. But in 1534 he became
          convinced of the necessity of stricter measures against the
          Anabaptists. Characteristic of Capito were not only his mildness
          and large-heartedness, but also a certain timidity and
          uncertainty in his theological and ecclesiastical position.
          However, this was not due to diplomatic opportunism, but to a
          sincere repugnance to unfruitful theological controversy and a
          religious individuality which had more regard to the inner
          possession of the fruits of salvation than to a dogmatic
          definition of the doctrine of salvation.

          He died of the plague after having attended the Diet at
          Regensburg.

   Capitularies
          CAPITULARIES: A term which designates a certain class of royal
          edicts in the Carolingian period, and which is frequently
          employed not only for the Carolingian capitilaria but also for
          the edicta, præceptiones, decreta, or decretiones of the
          Merovingian kings and the mayors of the palace under Arnulf.
          They are distinguished from the other class of diplomata or
          mandata, not so much by the division into chapters, from which
          they get their name, or by the general nature of their
          provisions as by their form and by the absence of any
          attestation in the way of signatures or seal. This absence is
          explained by the fact that they were either put into execution
          by the kings in person or had to pass through the hands of
          officials. They attained their highest importance under
          Charlemagne, and were scarcely less used under Louis the Pious;
          after his death they ceased in the East Frankish kingdom, to be
          kept up for a while in the West Frankish and in Italy by his
          sons and grandsons, disappearing here also toward the end of the
          ninth century. They contain partly instructions for officials,
          especially the missi dominici, and partly supplements or
          modifications of the old tribal law; but to a still greater
          extent they are substantive regulations for all departments of
          both secular said ecclesiastical life. The former include the
          most diverse matters, of administration, commerce, the army,
          markets, coinage, tolls, protection against robbers, etc. These
          substantive regulations go deeply into not merely the external
          organization of the Church and its relation to the temporal
          power, but also the monastic system, education, church
          discipline, and even liturgical matters.

          The origin of the capitularies and the basis of their authority
          have been much discussed. The prevalent view, derived in the
          first instance from Boretius, distinguishes between capitularia
          legibus addenda and per se scribenda, which means practically a
          class of laws originating (like those specifically known as
          leges) in the assent of the whole people, and another class
          originating from the king alone, at most with the advice of the
          nobles assembled in a diet. But there seems to be no sufficient
          ground for this distinction between popular and royal law; in so
          far as there is any contrast between leges and capitularia, it
          may be fully explained by the special reverence which was felt
          for the ancient tribal law. In the cases in which the
          capitularies do not contain merely instructions to officials,
          they were less legislative enactments than promulgations of a
          law already existing. This law, so far as we can trace its
          origin, came into being with the assent of the temporal and
          spiritual lords, assembled in diets or synods. But the diet must
          not be conceived of as a representative assembly of the whole
          people; its decisions were held to be binding upon the
          individual by virtue of his allegiance to the sovereign, and the
          period of the capitularies is precisely that in which the oath
          of allegiance was most punctiliously required from all adults
          within the empire. The multiplication of capitularies led before
          long to the need of codification; for the collection made by
          Ansegis of Fontanella, see [754]Ansegis, and for the forged
          capitularies appended to his collection by Benedictus Levita,

   Cappel (Cappellus)
          CAPPEL (CAPPELLUS): A French family which produced many
          noteworthy statesmen and scholars between the fifteenth and
          seventeenth centuries, as well as three theologians, Louis
          Cappel the Elder, Jacques Cappel the Third, and Louis Cappel the
          Younger.

          1. Louis Cappel the Elder: Reformed theologian; b. at Paris Jan.
          15, 1534; d. at Sédan Jan. 6, 1586. Despite the early death of
          his father, he received an excellent education, and in his
          twenty-second year went to Bordeaux to study law, but before
          long accepted a professorship of Greek. Becoming acquainted with
          certain of the Reformers, he was converted to their doctrines,
          and went to study theology at Geneva, where Calvin controlled
          the Church. Returning to Paris about 1560, he won the confidence
          of his coreligionists by his zeal for the interests of the
          Reformed, and was finally ordained pastor. He officiated
          successively at Meaux, Antwerp, and Clermont, but the constant
          outbreak of disturbances rendered any continuous activity
          impossible, and he was repeatedly obliged to retire to Sédan,
          where he was safe, since it lay in the duchy of Bouillon. In
          1575 he was appointed professor of theology at the University of
          Leyden, but was recalled in the following year to France and
          made preacher and professor of theology at Sédan, holding these
          positions until his death.

          2. Jacques Cappel the Third: Nephew of the preceding; b. at
          Rennes Mar., 1570; d. at Sédan Sept. 7, 1624. After completing
          his theological education at Sédan, he went in 1593 to his
          ancestral estate le Tilloi, where he preached for several years.
          In 1599 he accepted a call to Sédan as professor of Hebrew, and
          eleven years later was appointed professor of theology. His
          learning, piety, and charity won him high esteem. Among his
          numerous works special mention may be made of his Observationes
          in selecta Pentateuchi loca (ed. J. Cappel, in his Commentarii
          et notæ criticæ in Vetus Testamentum, Amsterdam, 1689) and his
          Historia sacra et exotica ab Adamo usque ad Augusti ortum
          (Sédan,1612).

          3. Louis Cappel the Younger: Youngest brother of the preceding;
          b. at St. Élier (a village near Sédan) Oct. 15, 1585; d. at
          Saumur June 18, 1658. His father, Jacques Cappel the Younger,
          who had been a parliamentary counselor at Rennes, had been
          forced to resign on account of his conversion to the Reformed
          Church and had been driven by the adherents of the League from
          his estates of le Tilloi. During his flight to his brother Louis
          Cappel the Elder at Sédan, his son was born and named for his
          uncle. After his father's death in 1586, the boy was taken by
          his mother to le Tilloi, where he was educated by Roman
          Catholics until his brother Jacques Cappel took him from their
          charge. He then studied theology in Sédan, and in 1609 received
          from the church in Bordeaux the means to study four years in
          England, Belgium, and Germany. On his return he was appointed
          professor of Hebrew at Saumur, but in 1621 the war forced him to
          take refuge with his brother at Sédan, where he remained three
          years. In 1626 he became professor of theology, and through him,
          together with Moïse Amyraut and Josué de la Place, Saumur
          attained high fame. Of his five sons two died in early youth,
          the eldest, Jean, became a convert to the Roman Catholic Church,
          and the youngest, Jacques the Fourth, when eighteen years of age
          succeeded his father as professor of Hebrew at Saumur. Louis
          Cappel was a man of piety, sincerity, courage, energy, and
          learning. His life-work was devoted to the study of the history
          of the text of the Old Testament and the refutation of false
          views concerning it. His first book, Arcanum punctationis
          revelatum, was completed in 1623, and sought to prove that the
          Hebrew punctuation did not originate with Moses and the other
          Biblical authors, but had been introduced by Jewish scholars
          after the completion of the Babylonian Talmud. The novelty of
          the book is not its assertion, but its logical proof. The work
          was sent by its author to various scholars for their opinions,
          but while Buxtorf at Basel counseled caution, Erpenius at Leyden
          had it printed anonymously on his own responsibility in 1624.
          The book found a friendly reception in many quarters, but twenty
          years later Buxtorf's son attacked the author bitterly in his
          Tractatus de punctorum origine (Basel, 1648). Cappel replied
          with his Vindiciæ arcani punctationis, although it first
          appeared thirty years after his death in the Commentarii et notæ
          criticæ in Vetus Testamentum edited by his son, Jacques Cappel
          the Fourth (Amsterdam, 1689). His second famous work was the
          Critica sacra (Paris, 1650), based on the theory of the
          integrity of the text and completed in 1634, although it
          remained unprinted for many years on account of the opposition
          of the Protestants in Geneva, Leyden, and Sédan. The work is
          divided into six books with the following subjects: parallel
          passages in the Old Testament; citations from the Old Testament
          in the New; the various readings of the keri and kethibh, the
          manuscripts of the Oriental and Occidental Jews, printed Bibles,
          and the Masoretic and Samaritan texts of the Pentateuch;
          deviations in the Septuagint from the Masoretic text; variants
          in other ancient translations, the Talmud, and early Jewish
          writings; the choice of readings and the restoration of the
          original text. Cappel was obliged to meet repeated attacks. Even
          when his work first appeared, it contained a defense against the
          younger Buxtorf, who had learned the contents of the book before
          it was printed, and had combated it in the Tractatus already
          mentioned. Certain passages which had been omitted in the
          original edition against his will were added by Cappel in his
          Epistola apologetica (Saumur, 1651), another work in his own
          defense. A new edition of the Critica sacra was prepared by G.
          J. L. Vogel and J. G. Scharfenberg (3 vols., Halle, 1775-86).
          His third important writing was the Diatriba de veris et
          antiquis Hebræorum literis (Amsterdam, 1645), in which he proved
          the priority of the Samaritan script over the square characters
          and thus refuted the treatise of the younger Buxtorf, De
          litterarum Hebraicarum genuina antiquitate (1643). In these
          writings Cappel discussed problems which were of the utmost
          importance to the Protestants in their controversy with the
          Roman Catholics. Of his opponents the younger Buxtorf was the
          most important, and had practically all the theologians of
          Germany and Switzerland on his side, while many prominent
          scholars of France, England, and Holland defended the views of
          Cappel. The first sentences of the Helvetic Consensus Formula of
          1675 are directed against Cappel, the greater number of the rest
          being aimed at Amyraut. In later times a fairer and calmer
          judgment prevailed concerning the investigations of Cappel, and
          his results are now generally accepted. A list of his printed
          and unprinted works is given by his son Jacques in the
          Commentarii noted above. Special mention may also be made of his
          Templi Hierosolymitani delineatio triplex and Chronologia sacra
          both contained in Walton's Polyglot), as well as of his Historia
          apostolica illustrata (Geneva, 1634). [His Pivot de la foi et
          religion (Saumur, 1643) was translated into English by P.
          Marinel (London, 1660).]

   Capreolus, Johannes
          CAPREOLUS, JOHANNES: The most distinguished Thomist theologian
          of the fifteenth century; d. 1444. Little is known of his life.
          According to Quétif, he joined the Dominican order at Rodez. The
          subscriptions of the four books of his Defensiones (first
          printed in Venice, 1483), where he is described as of Toulouse,
          tell that he finished the first book in 1409 at Paris, where he
          was then lecturing, the others at Rodez in 1426, 1428, and 1433.
          So, at least, Quétif asserts; but an extant copy of the editio
          princeps assigns the composition of the first three books to
          1409, and the fourth to 1432, no place given; and the second
          edition (Venice, 1514-15) gives 1409 for the first two, 1428 and
          1432 for the others, all in Paris. The diversity renders all the
          dates uncertain; nor can we be sure of the date (Apr. 6, 1444)
          assigned to his death by an inscription on his tomb at Rodez, of
          evidently later composition. The Dominicans of Toulouse assert
          that he was for some time at the head of their studium generale.

   Capuchins
          CAPUCHINS: A branch of the order of Franciscans, founded in the
          third decade of the sixteenth century by Matteo di Bassi, an
          Observantine Franciscan. Repeated attempts had been made since
          the fourteenth century to restore the primitive strength and
          simplicity of the Franciscan rule, and one of these movements
          was concerned especially with the habit of the order. In
          connection with this attempted reform, Matteo was told by a
          brother mock that the cowl worn by St. Francis differed
          essentially from that adopted by his order.

    Early History.

          Matteo thereupon left his monastery of Montefalcone and hastened
          to Rome, where in 1526 he obtained permission from Clement VII.
          to wear a pyramidal hood and a beard, to live as a hermit, and
          to preach wheresoever he wished, on condition that he should
          report annually to the provincial chapter of the Observantines.
          Matteo's example was followed by his fellow Observantines
          Lodovico and Raffaelle di Fossombrone, both of whom received
          similar privileges from the pope; and the three, soon joined by
          a fourth, found a home with the Camaldolites and the duke of
          Camerino. Through the duke's influence, they were received among
          the Conventuals in 1527, whereupon Lodovico and Raffaelle
          returned to Rome and obtained from the pope the bull of May 18,
          1528, by which they were permitted to preach repentance, have
          the care of souls, especially of abandoned sinners, and form a
          congregation with the privileges already granted them. They were
          freed, moreover, from the Observantines and placed under the
          control of the Conventuals, since their vicar-general must be
          confirmed by the general of the Conventuals, while they were to
          receive visitations from the Conventuals and were obliged in
          their processions to march under the cross either of the
          Conventuals or the parish clergy. The members of the new order
          speedily became conspicuous by their long beards and pointed
          hoods or capuches, whence they were termed Capuchins in
          ecclesiastical documents as early as 1536 (Capucini ordinis
          fratrum minorum or Fratres minores Capucini). Their first
          monastery was given them by the duchess of Camerino, but by 1529
          they possessed four houses and in the same year their first
          chapter was convened. At the same time the rules of the order
          were drawn up, and thenceforth remained essentially unchanged.

    Rule.

          The Capuchins were required to preserve the primitive service,
          to refuse all compensation for singing mass, to devote two hours
          daily to silent prayer, to observe silence throughout the day
          with the exception of two hours, to practise flagellation, to
          beg only what was necessary for each day, to provide only for
          three or at most seven days, and never to touch money. The use
          of meat and wine in strict moderation was allowed, but the
          friars were forbidden to beg for meat, eggs, or cheese, although
          they might accept them when they were offered. The habit was to
          be poor and coarse, and the brothers, who might ride neither on
          horseback nor in wagons, were required to go barefoot, sandals
          being allowed only in special cases. The monasteries, which were
          to contain at most ten or twelve friars each, were to be fitted
          in the most meager manner possible. In addition to the general,
          the Capuchins had provincials, custodians, and guardians, but no
          procurators or syndics. Elections were held annually, except in
          the case of the general, who was elected by the chapter
          triennially.

    Since the Reformation.

          The first vicar-general was Matteo di Bassi himself, but two
          months after his election in 1529 he resigned, and in 1537
          returned to the Observantines. He was succeeded by Lodovico di
          Fossombrone, who failed of reelection in 1535 and was expelled
          for exciting dissatisfaction within the order. The next heads of
          the Capuchins were Giovanni de Fano and [758]Bernardino Ochino.
          The defection of the latter to Protestantism in 1543 caused Paul
          III. to contemplate the dissolution of the order, and for a
          number of years the Capuchins were forbidden to preach. The
          result of Ochino's act was the transformation of the Capuchins
          into a rigidly ultramontane order which renounced all
          independent judgment in matters of faith and doctrine.

          After the middle of the sixteenth century the spread of the
          order was rapid. Originally restricted to Italy, it was
          established in France at the request of Charles IX. in 1573, and
          in 1593 entered Germany, after having already been implanted in
          Switzerland. In 1606 it was in Spain, and thirteen years later
          was freed from the Conventuals and received its own general, as
          well as the right to march in processions under its own cross.
          The Capuchins, who then had 1,500 monasteries and fifty
          provinces, followed the Spaniards and Portuguese across the sea,
          and toiled valiantly for the Church in America, Africa, and Asia
          beside their great rivals, the Jesuits. In the suppression of
          the monastic orders in France and Germany at the end of the
          eighteenth century, the Capuchins suffered severely, and had
          also to endure much south of the Pyrenees. In the nineteenth
          century, however, they again prospered, and at its close
          numbered fifty provinces with 534 monasteries and 294 hospices.
          The twenty-five Italian provinces are officially suppressed, but
          retain a limited existence. Of the other twenty-five, Germany
          contains two, Austria and Hungary seven Switzerland two, Belgium
          and Holland one each, France five, Great Britain three, Russia
          and Poland two, and the United States two, that of Detroit with
          sixty-eight fathers and that of Pittsburg with sixty-five.

          Capuchin nuns were founded at Naples in the first half of the
          sixteenth century, although, strictly speaking, they are a
          branch of the Clares. They now have a number of houses in
          France, Italy, Spain, and America, and are subject, when the
          nunnery contains the full number of thirty-three, to the
          jurisdiction of the general of the Capuchins, and in other cases
          to the bishop of the diocese in which they live.

          Capuchin scholars have been authors of works of edification,
          practical exegesis, moral theology, and sermons. Among their
          most famous preachers have been Ochino, John Forbes, St.
          Laurence of Brindisi, Jacques Bolduc, Conrad of Salzburg, and
          Martin of Cochem. Father Joseph, the confidant and adviser of
          Richelieu, and Father Matthew, the noted temperance lecturer,
          were Capuchins.

   Caputiati
          CAPUTIATI, c??-pu´tî-??´´tî ("hooded," "capuched"; also known as
          Paciferi and Blancs Chaperons): A society founded in 1183 at
          Puy-en Velay (Le Puy, 68 m. s.w. of Lyons) in the Auvergne by a
          poor artisan called Durand to oppose the fearful devastations
          caused by the mercenary and predatory bands of the "Brabancons"
          or "Cotereaux." Durand claimed that the Madonna had authorized
          him to do this; the members of the society were to wear a white
          dress with a capuche and a leaden image of the wonder-working
          Madonna of Puy. Organized after the manner of an ecclesiastical
          brotherhood, the Caputiati followed the royal troops and took
          bloody vengeance on the destroyers of peace. The society did not
          last long. Later reports, but little reliable, make its members
          rebels against State and Church, who, as is alleged, were routed
          about 1186 and condemned to do penance. Even in late times, from
          too implicit reliance on these reports, the Caputiati have been
          considered a sect opposed to the Church.

   Caraccioli, Galeazzo
          CARACCIOLI, c??-r??´chî-O´´lî, GALEAZZO (Marchese di Vico):
          Italian Protestant; b. at Naples 1517; d. at Geneva July 5,
          1586. He was the most distinguished of the Italians who sought a
          refuge at Geneva when the reaction came over Italy; his mother
          was a sister of Pope Paul IV., he was in the royal service, and
          his wife was a Cáraffa. At Naples he became acquainted with Juan
          de Valdès and Peter Vermigli, who at that time preached there,
          and was deeply impressed by these reformatory men. The
          evangelical ideas which he imbibed at Naples and which caused
          him many struggles in his family and in society, were deepened
          by a journey to Germany in 1544. He found it impossible to make
          open profession at Naples; the efforts to introduce the
          Inquisition after the Spanish pattern were frustrated by the
          resistance of the people in 1547 bordering on a revolution; but,
          nevertheless, the vice-regent urged the suppression of every
          anti-Roman opinion. Caraccioli decided to forsake fatherland,
          position, and possessions rather than to continue as a
          hypocrite. Pretending to go to the imperial court at Augsburg,
          he left Italy, his wife refusing to follow him. He reached
          Geneva June 8, 1551, and joined the Italian community which was
          founded there in 1542. All efforts of his people to bring him
          back, renewed by Paul IV., after his accession in 1555, were in
          vain. Toward the end of 1555 he became a citizen of Geneva. He
          kept up correspondence with his wife and his son and in 1558 met
          them once more in a little isle of the Adriatic Sea and in the
          paternal castle at Vico; as they refused to follow him, in spite
          of his entreaties, he left them forever. The consistories of
          Geneva and other places declared his marriage dissolved, and in
          1560 he married again.

   Carchemish
          CARCHEMISH, c??r´che-mish (modern Jerabis): A city situated on
          the right bank of the Euphrates in the upper part of its course.
          In the cuneiform inscriptions the name denotes either a Hittite
          state or the capital of that state, which long maintained itself
          against the Assyrians. Its earlier identification with
          Circesium, at the confluence of the Chebar with the Euphrates,
          is obsolete. The earliest mention dates from Ammi-zaduga (about
          2200 B.C.), which speaks of the weight (measure) of Carchemish,
          a mention which agrees with a later Assyrian note of the "Mina
          of Carchemish," and with the city's location on one of the most
          important routes of commerce. It appears first in Assyrian
          annals in the accounts of Tiglath-Pileser I. about 1110 B.C. The
          Hittite power was at that early date already breaking under the
          pressure of the northern immigrations then going on, and was
          completed later by the Aramean migrations. King Sangara paid
          tribute to Asshurnasirpal (about 880 B.C.), was worsted in a
          conflict with Shalmaneser II., and was compelled again to pay
          heavy tribute and to send his daughter to the Assyrian's harem.
          Its last king, Pisiris, was taken prisoner by Sargon II., 717
          B.C., and under Sennacherib the region was made an Assyrian
          province. Near it was fought the battle between Nebuchadrezzar
          and Necho which decided the fate of western Asia.

   Cardale, John Bate
          CARDALE, JOHN BATE: Apostle of the Catholic Apostolic Church; b.
          in London Nov. 2, 1802; d. at Albury (26 m. s.w. of London),
          Surrey, July 18, 1877. After his schooling at Rugby he was
          admitted to the bar in 1822, became head of a London firm of
          solicitors, and retired with a competency in 1834. He had
          already become interested in the religious movement, originating
          in Scotland, known as the "[760]Catholic Apostolic Church",
          whose distinguishing feature is its belief in the revival of the
          ministries and gifts seen in the apostolic age of the Church,
          especially of the ministries of apostles and prophets. Mr.
          Cardale was the first called of the twelve "apostles" of the
          Church, [761]Henry Drummond being the second. This was in 1832,
          although it was not until July 14, 1835, when the number was
          completed, that the twelve were formally set apart to their work
          as an Apostolic College. Mr. Cardale was the author of a number
          of anonymous religious publications, the most noteworthy of
          which was Reagdins upon the Liturgy, London, vol. i., 1849-51,
          vol. ii., 1852-78. G. C. Boase, in the Dictionary of National
          Biography, says of him: "His strength of will, calmness and
          clearness of judgment, and kindness of heart and manner, added
          to the prestige of his long rule, made him a tower of strength.
          He was indefatigable in labour, of which he accomplished a vast
          amount; besides Latin and Greek, he was a good French and German
          scholar, and late in life learned Danish."

   Carey, William
          CAREY, WILLIAM: Baptist missionary and Orientalist; b. at
          Paulerspury, Northamptonshire, Eng., Aug. 17, 1761; d. at
          Serampur, India, June 9, 1834. By baptism a member of the
          Established Church, he was early in life convinced of the
          Scriptural authority for the Baptist views, and joined this
          sect, in which he soon became a preacher. His congregations were
          very poor, and he supported himself and family by shoemaking.
          But his thirst for knowledge was strong; and he managed,
          notwithstanding the pressure of poverty, to acquire Latin,
          Greek, Hebrew, and a goodly amount of other useful learning,
          especially in natural history and botany. His attention was
          turned to the heathen, and he saw plainly his duty to go to
          them. On Oct. 2, 1792, largely through his exertions, the first
          Baptist missionary society was founded; and on June 13, 1793, he
          and his family sailed for India, accompanied by John Thomas, who
          had formerly lived in Bengal. On reaching Bengal early in 1794,
          Carey and his companion lost all their property in the Hugli;
          but, having received the charge of an indigo-factory at Malda,
          he cut off his pecuniary connection with the missionary society,
          and began in earnest what, instead of regular missionary labor,
          was to be the work of his life--the study of and translation
          both from and into the languages of India. In 1799 the factory
          was closed; and he went with Thomas to Kidderpur, where he had
          purchased a small indigo-plantation. Here, joined by Marshman
          and Ward, he started, under bright hopes a mission, but soon
          encountered the opposition of the Indian government, which
          forbade the mission's enlargement, and compelled its removal, at
          a great pecuniary loss, to Serampur, a Danish settlement (1800),
          where it took a fresh lease of life. For some time Carey and
          Thomas had been diligently at work upon a version of the New
          Testament in Bengali. In 1801 it was published by the press
          Carey instituted. About the same time the Marquis of Wellesley
          appointed him professor of Oriental languages in the Fort
          William College, which the marquis had founded at Calcutta for
          the instruction of the younger members of the British Indian
          civil service. Carey held this position for thirty years, and
          taught Bengali, Mahrati, and Sanskrit. He wrote articles upon
          the natural history and botany of India for the Asiatic Society,
          to which he was elected, 1805, and thus made practical
          application of acquisitions of former years; but this was only a
          part, and by far the less valuable part, of his work. That which
          has given him his undying fame was his translation of the Bible,
          in whole or in part, either alone or with others, into some
          twenty-six Indian languages. The Serampur press, under his
          direction, rendered the Bible accessible to more than three
          hundred million human beings. Besides, he prepared grammars and
          dictionaries of several tongues; e.g., Mahratta Grammar, 1805;
          Sanscrit Grammar, 1806; Mahratta Dictionary, 1810; Bengalee
          Dictionary, 1818; and a dictionary of all Sanskrit-derived
          languages, which unhappily was destroyed by a fire in the
          printing establishment in 1812. Later students have discovered
          errors and omissions in these works; but all honor is due to
          Carey for "breaking the way," and every inhabitant of India is
          his debtor.

   Cargill, Donald (Daniel)
          CARGILL, DONALD (or DANIEL): One of the leaders of the Scotch
          Covenanters; b. in the parish of Rattray, Perthshire, 1619;
          beheaded at Edinburgh July 27, 1681. He was educated at Aberdeen
          and St. Andrews; and about 1650 he became pastor of the Barony
          Church, Glasgow. In 1661, when Episcopacy was established in
          Scotland, he refused to accept his charge from the archbishop,
          and was banished (1662) beyond the Tay; but he did not go;
          instead he became one of the "field preachers," who, deprived of
          their churches, preached in the open air. In 1679 he joined
          Cameron, Douglas, Hamilton, and others in the rebellion against
          prelacy, which arose out of the "Rutherglen Declaration" of May
          29 of that year, and with his fellow Covenanters endured the
          defeat of Bothwell Bridge, June 22. He fled to Holland, but soon
          returned. The next year he and Cameron, with their adherents,
          drew up the "Sanquhar Declaration," June 22. The government set
          a price upon the leaders' heads. They were attacked at Ayrsmoss,
          July 22, and Cameron was slain; but Cargill succeeded to the
          leadership, and, as if to testify in the most signal manner his
          abhorrence of the tyrannical persecutors, he publicly
          excommunicated the king and several of the nobles at a
          field-preaching held at Torwood in Stirlingshire in September.
          When the Duke of York, one of the " excommunicated," came to
          Scotland, the persecution of the followers of Cargill increased.
          He himself was hunted from place to place; but on July 11, 1681,
          he was captured between Clydesdale and Lothian, and taken to
          Edinburgh for trial. He readily confessed that he had done what
          the council had called treason. The council were equally divided
          whether to imprison him for life or to execute him; but the vote
          of the Duke of Argyle decided in favor of the latter--a vote
          which cost Argyle, later on, the support of the Covenanters, to
          say nothing of deep remorse. Accordingly Cargill was put to
          death. See [763]Covenanters.

          was educated at Highbury College, London, but did not take a
          degree. He entered commercial life in 1862, but in 1878
          matriculated at the London College of Divinity, and was ordered
          deacon in 1880 and ordained priest in the following year. He was
          curate of Kensington from 1880 to 1882, when he founded the
          Church Army in the Westminster slums, and in 1890 established
          the Social System of Church Army in Marylebone. He was also
          rector of Netteswell, Essex, in 1890-91, and since the latter
          year has been rector of St. Mary-at-Hill, Eastcheap, London. He
          was appointed a prebendary of St. Paul's Cathedral, London, in
          1906, and has written: The Church and Conversion (London, 1882);
          Spiritual Difficulties (1885), and The Continental Outcast (in
          collaboration with V. W. Carlile; 1906).

   Carlstadt (Karlstadt, Carolstadt), Andreas Rudolf Bodenstein von

          BODENSTEIN VON: Protestant Reformer; b. at Karlstadt (14 m. n.w.
          of Würzburg), Bavaria, c. 1480; d. at Basel Dec. 24, 1541. The
          assumption that he pursued his academical studies at foreign
          universities rests upon a confusion with his later journey to
          Rome. In the winter term of 1499-1500 he entered the University
          of Erfurt, where he remained until 1503, and then removed to
          Cologne. In 1504 he turned to the newly established University
          of Wittenberg, in which he acquired considerable fame as a
          teacher of philosophy. He was a zealous adherent of
          scholasticism, advocating the unconditional authority of Thomas
          Aquinas.

    Training and Life to 1518.

          By 1510 he had obtained all the higher academical degrees. In
          1508 he received a canonry at the collegiate church in
          Wittenberg and in 1510 became archdeacon. As such he had to
          preach and read mass once a week and to lecture at the
          university. In 1515 he left Wittenberg, without the permission
          of the university and the elector, and went to Rome, where he
          studied law and took a degree, hoping to obtain the first
          prelacy at Wittenberg, for which legal training was necessary.
          He did not succeed, however, in obtaining the position after his
          return. His journey to Rome brought about a rupture with
          scholasticism. The evidence of the worldliness of the papacy
          which Carlstadt saw in Rome may have been the chief factor in
          the change of his religious views. His 151 theses of Sept.,
          1516, contain the fundamental traits of his later theology. He
          combats the scholastics and Aristotle (theses xxxvii., cxliii.),
          and even anticipates Luther, on the basis of Augustine,
          concerning the inability of the human will to attain unto God
          and in attributing the act of redemption exclusively to the work
          of divine grace. Thus no direct dependence of Carlstadt upon
          Luther can be assumed; each influenced the other after 1516,
          although a bond of personal friendship never united them.

    Deviates from Church Teachings.

          In the spring of 1518 Carlstadt published a comprehensive
          collection of theses, on the occasion of Eck's attack upon the
          ninety-five theses of Luther. Here he affirms for the Bible the
          most absolute authority as a source of religious knowledge and
          adheres to its literal interpretation. In June and July a
          disputation took place between Carlstadt and Eck, and although
          the former was always equal to the dialectic cleverness of his
          opponent, he became more and more conscious of the impossibility
          of reconciling his convictions with the ruling doctrine of the
          Church. He emphasized more and more the efficacy of divine grace
          alone in the redemption of humanity, and wrote polemical
          treatises against the church doctrine of justification by works
          and against indulgences. In 1521 he went to Denmark by
          invitation of King Christian II. and helped in the establishment
          of ecclesiastical laws, but after a few weeks in Copenhagen he
          had to give way before the united resistance of nobility and
          clergy. In June he was again at Wittenberg, where he expressed
          his views concerning the Lord's Supper in a treatise Von den
          Empfahern Zeichen und Zusag des heiligen Sacraments. In this
          treatise he still clings to the corporal presence of Christ in
          the sacrament, but looks upon it only as a sign of divine
          promise. In another treatise Carlstadt places beside the literal
          explanation of Scripture a spiritual interpretation which
          penetrates its deeper sense and rests upon divine
          interpretation. Here are to be found certain points of contact
          between the views of Carlstadt and those of the enthusiasts.

    The Reformation at Wittenberg, 1521-22.

          The attitude of Carlstadt in the Wittenberg disturbances and his
          doings there during Luther's stay at the Wartburg have
          frequently been represented in an erroneous light. When the
          Augustinians, in Oct., 1521, refused to hold mass and demanded
          the administration of the Lord's Supper in both kinds, the
          university appointed a commission of four theologians, among
          them Carlstadt, to investigate. Against the more decided
          attitude of Melanchthon, Carlstadt conceded that the abolition
          of the mass could only be accomplished with the consent of the
          magistracy. A letter, expressing the same spirit and signed by
          seven professors, was sent to the elector. As the excitement did
          not abate, Carlstadt tried to quiet the more strenuous by
          emphasizing the Gospel as the proper guide in all actions.
          Nevertheless, the disturbances continued until on Christmas day
          he administered the Lord's Supper in both kinds. His action was
          approved by all Evangelicals. From this moment he was silently
          acknowledged as the leader of the reformatory movement in
          Wittenberg. He did not stop with the reformation of the Lord's
          Supper. At the end of 1521 and at the beginning of 1522
          auricular confession, the elevation of the host, and the
          injunctions concerning fasting were abolished. Jan. 19, 1522,
          Carlstadt married. On being informed of the events in
          Wittenberg, the so-called Zwickau prophets arrived (see
          [765]Anabaptists, II., § 1; [766]Zwickau Prophets), but
          Carlstadt kept aloof; it was only at the end of 1522 that he
          began to correspond with [767]Thomas Münzer. He proceeded in his
          reforms in entire conformity with the Council of Wittenberg, in
          which he saw the supreme authority in the ecclesiastical affairs
          of the city. He soon opened the battle against pictures in the
          churches, in which he was assisted by the council. Some small
          excesses occurred, which, however, were severely condemned by
          both the council and Carlstadt.

          These ecclesiastical changes had aroused the displeasure of
          Frederick the Wise, who was especially offended by the abolition
          of the mass. Carlstadt and Melanchthon were called to account.
          Melanchthon immediately showed himself submissive; Carlstadt
          also promised in Feb., 1522, to renounce further innovations
          after he had carried through the reforms which he deemed
          essential. But Frederick desired an entire rehabilitation of the
          Old Church usages. The course of events made it impossible for
          Luther to remain at the Wartburg. He did not agree with
          Carlstadt's radical measures, believing that forbearance ought
          to be shown toward the weak. After his arrival at Wittenberg, on
          Mar. 6, he succeeded in shaking the dominating position of
          Carlstadt and counteracting his reforms. The Lord's Supper sub
          una specie was restored, also the elevation of the host.
          Carlstadt remained as professor in the university, but lost all
          his influence. As he was thus deprived of the possibility of
          being active in a practical way, he devoted himself to
          speculative theology. His views were somewhat mystical, but,
          unlike the true mystics, Carlstadt was not satisfied with the
          contemplative rapture in the union of the soul with God, and set
          up ethical standards for the practical realization of his new
          convictions. In his desire to do away with all intermediary
          agencies in the religious communication between God and man, he
          denied the indelible character of orders and did not even
          acknowledge the ministry as a special profession. He called
          himself after 1523 "ein neuer Lai," put off his clerical robes,
          and lived for some time as a peasant in Segrena, near
          Wittenberg, with relatives of his wife.

    At Orlamünde, 1524.

          In 1524 Carlstadt became preacher in Orlamünde, where he carried
          on the reform of the church service as he had done two years
          before in Wittenberg. He expounded the book of Acts daily to his
          congregation, and on Sundays and holidays the Gospel of John. In
          the course of his development Carlstadt arrived at the
          conviction that baptism and the Lord's Supper are not
          sacraments. At the same time be strongly attacked the mass.
          Against Luther he wrote Verstand des Worts Pauli Ich begeret ein
          Verbannter sein. Without mentioning Luther's name, he shows the
          dangerous consequences to which the exaggeration of the
          principle concerning forbearance for the weak might lead. Apart
          from his controversial writings, Carlstadt emphasized the
          necessity of personal devotion and sanctification.

    Hardships of his Later Life.

          Carlstadt did not derive his political or social principles from
          his theological views. When Münzer's revolutionary measures in
          Allstädt became threatening, Carlstadt cautioned him, and he
          induced the people of Orlamünde to separate themselves formally
          from those of Allstädt. Nevertheless, the points of difference
          between Wittenberg and Orlamünde were so considerable that the
          university took active measures against Carlstadt. Luther met
          Carlstadt at Jena, in Aug., 1524, and thence proceeded to
          Orlamünde; he was not successful, however, in settling the
          difficulties. In September Carlstadt with his family, his
          adherents Martin Reinhard, preacher in Jena, and Gerhard
          Westerburg, his brother-in-law, were expelled from the territory
          of the elector. Carlstadt now encountered a time full of
          hardships and dangers, but he developed an extraordinary
          activity as a writer. The assumption of the corporal presence of
          Christ in the Lord's Supper is, according to him, in
          contradiction to the fundamental presuppositions of Christian
          doctrine. He found adherents to these ideas not only among the
          people, but many even in the clergy. In Oct., 1524, he sojourned
          at Strasburg, then lived temporarily in Heidelberg, Zurich,
          Basel, Schweinfurt, Kitzingen, and Nördlingen. He was active for
          a considerable time in Rothenburg-on-the-Tauber, where his
          sermons carried away the great majority of the citizens. It was
          at this time that the Peasants' War broke out in Rothenburg.
          Carlstadt was sent as envoy to the peasants, thus making himself
          unpopular among them. After the defeat of the South German
          peasants and the capture of Rothenburg by Margrave Casimir,
          Carlstadt escaped from the town with difficulty. The collapse of
          his hopes broke down his power of resistance. He wrote humbly to
          Luther to open the way for his return to Saxony. Luther took
          pity upon him, and Carlstadt returned to Wittenberg after he had
          recanted to some degree his doctrine concerning the Lord's
          Supper; but he had to pledge himself not to teach or preach. He
          lived at first in Segrena, after 1528 is Bergwitz, where he had
          to earn his living like a peasant. Before the close of the year
          he was reduced almost to poverty, and he removed to the little
          town of Kemberg and kept a small store. He soon retracted his
          former recantation and was compelled to flee. In Mar., 1529, he
          was with Melchior Hofmann, the Anabaptist, in Holstein. Being
          expelled hence also, he wandered with Hofmann to East Friesland,
          where he remained until the beginning of 1530 and gathered a
          great number of adherents. Thence he went to Switzerland, where
          he was kindly received by Zwingli, who secured for him a
          position as assistant preacher in Zurich. In Sept., 1531, he
          became preacher in Altstätten in the valley of the Rhine, but
          the unfortunate battle near Kappel (Oct. 11) compelled him after
          a few months to return to Zurich, where he lived in close union
          with the Reformers of that city. The preachers of Zurich took
          Carlstadt's part when Luther renewed his attacks. In 1534 he was
          called to Basel as preacher and professor in the university.
          Here he became involved in disputes with Myconius; the people
          took Carlstadt's part, but he estranged himself from his friends
          in Zurich. He fulfilled his last public task in 1536, when the
          government of Basel sent him with Grynæus to Strasburg to
          negotiate with the theologians of that city concerning a
          reconciliation with the Wittenberg theologians on the question
          of the Lord's Supper. He showed a very conciliatory spirit,
          which was not approved by the Swiss theologians.

    Writings.

          Carlstadt's earliest writings, De intentionibus (1507),
          Distinctiones sive formalilates Thomistæ (1508), were of a
          scholastic nature. His journey to Rome occasioned his treatise
          Von päpstlicher Heiligkeit (1520), in which he criticized the
          abuses of popery. In De canonicis scripturis (1520) he laid down
          the results of his investigations of the Old and the New
          Testament writings; he shows himself a free and independent
          critic, but does not shake the authority of the literal sense.
          In 1521 appeared Von den Empfahern Zeichen und Zusag des
          heiligen Sacraments and Von Gelübden Unterrichtung; in the
          latter treatise he advocated the abolition of monastic vows,
          especially the vow of celibacy. In Sept., 1521, appeared De
          legis litera sive carne et spiritu; here Carlstadt propounded
          for the first time an entirely new principle of interpretation
          which became of much importance in the further development of
          his theology--the spiritual interpretation of the words of
          Scripture. Against pictures in churches he wrote in 1522 Von
          Abthuung der Bilder. In 1524 he published Priestertum und Opfer
          Christi. After his expulsion from Saxony in 1524 appeared the
          most radical of his writings, Ob man gemach faren soll, in which
          he denies the corporeal presence of Christ in the Lord's Supper,
          and Anzeig etlicher Hauptartikel christlicher Lehre, which
          contains a comprehensive summary of his views. He combats the
          central position which the conception of sin had assumed in
          Luther's theology, as he understood it, and emphasizes the
          necessity that Christian liberty and justice must produce fruits
          in good works.

    Life and Writings.

          He was early noted for his extraordinary memory, and for his
          love of reading. He entered the University of Edinburgh in 1810,
          and distinguished himself as a mathematician, but declared that
          he owed nothing to the university but the miscellaneous reading
          afforded by its library. Having abandoned the study of theology,
          he taught mathematics in the high school at Annan for two years.
          In 1816 he was appointed rector of the Burgh School at
          Kirkcaldy. Here he devoted himself to the study of German, and
          translated Legendre's Geometry, adding an introductory essay on
          proportion.

          Carlyle removed to Edinburgh in 1818, where he supported himself
          by literary work, pursued a large and varied course of reading,
          and devoted much time to the study of German. From 1820 to 1823
          he contributed a number of articles to the Edinburgh
          Encyclopædia and the Edinburgh Review. In 1824 he introduced
          Goethe to English readers by the translation of Wilhelm
          Meister's Lehrjahre, and in 1825 published the Life of Schiller.
          He married Jane Welsh in 1826, and removed in 1828 to
          Craigenputtoch, where he wrote his Critical and Miscellaneous
          Essays, and Sartor Resartus, a philosophic romance in the form
          of a treatise on dress, containing his views on the problems of
          religion and life; it was published during 1833-34, in Fraser's
          Magazine.

          In 1834 he removed to London, to the house in Cheyne Row,
          Chelsea, where he resided until his death. In 1837 appeared The
          French Revolution, the first of his works to which his name was
          formally attached. In the same year he began lecturing, and,
          during 1837-43, delivered courses on German Literature, The
          Periods of European Culture, the Revolutions of Modern Europe,
          and Heroes and Hero-Worship, besides publishing Chartism, a
          political treatise, and Past and Present.

          One of his most important works, Oliver Cromwell's Letters and
          Speeches, was issued in 1845, and produced a great revolution of
          sentiment in favor of Cromwell. In 1840 Carlyle inaugurated the
          movement which resulted in the London Library, of which he was
          afterward elected president. During 1848-50 he wrote a number of
          political and social treatises, notably The Latter Day
          Pamphlets, the ultimate and most violent expression of his
          political creed.

          The Life of John Sterling, especially valuable as a partial
          expression of his own religious views, appeared in 1851. His
          magnum opus, The History of Frederick the Great, was begun in
          1858, and finished in 1865. It is a monument of patient industry
          and minute research, and contains a complete political history
          of the eighteenth century. In 1866 Carlyle was chosen rector of
          the University of Edinburgh, and delivered an inaugural on The
          Choice of Books. Mrs. Carlyle died during his absence on this
          occasion (Apr. 21). A few newspaper articles, with Historical
          Sketches of the Early Kings of Norway, and The Portraits of John
          Knox, marked the next five years, and completed his literary
          labors.

          Carlyle's life is marked by great unity of purpose and
          concentration of energy. He lived for literature. With his
          imaginative genius, his poetic insight, and his opulent diction,
          he was a poet by constitution; but his lack of the sense of form
          and proportion, and his impatience of measured expression, made
          him despise poetry. He is a preacher and a prophet rather than
          an artist. His keen sense of the grotesque, with the real depth
          of his nature, made him a humorist at once racy, subtle, and
          satirical; but this element developed itself disproportionately,
          and ran into cynicism as he grew older.

    Ethics and Philosophy.

          Notwithstanding the large admixture of ethics and philosophy in
          his writings, it is well-nigh impossible to define accurately
          his position as a philosopher, moralist, or religionist.
          Veracity is the basis of his ethical conceptions, by which he
          means the disposition to go behind appearances to facts, and the
          assertion of reality as against mere symbols and
          conventionalities. His hatred of shams is intense, and often
          leads him into needless roughness of speech. His ethical ideal
          is defective from its identification of physical and moral
          order, of might and right. It is too subjective, lodging the
          teat of right in each man's moral consciousness. Hence his
          fundamental fallacy, expounded in Hero-Worship, and applied in
          Frederick the reverence for strength, regardless of moral
          quality. He is a dangerous guide, therefore, as a historian and
          political philosopher. His conception of history as only the
          record of the world's great men is radically false. He has no
          sense of the popular power in the solution of political
          problems. The moral teaching of his histories is unsound in
          blinding the reader to vice through the admiration of greatness.
          The logical outcome of his political philosophy is slavery and
          despotism. As a historian he is distinguished by exact and
          laborious attention to detail. He studies folios and pasquinades
          alike; and no detail of topography, feature, or costume escapes
          him. His histories are a series of striking portraits or
          pictures. He stands committed to no philosophical system. With
          much talk about the real and practical, his philosophy is
          intuitional and sentimental, emphasizing feeling above reason.

    Religious Views.

          Theologically he can not be accurately placed. The Life of
          Sterling throws most light upon his religious views. He may
          fairly be regarded as a theist. He is mainly silent on the truth
          of creeds, always reverential toward Christ, and, while agreeing
          that Christianity is the supreme religion, denies that it
          embraces all truth. He seems to hold that responsibility to God
          is the essential truth foreshadowed in all religions, and that
          the essence of all religion is to keep conscience alive and
          shining. He believes in retribution as the natural outcome of
          wrong. He revered genuine piety, and his own moral life was
          singularly pure. As a critic he has great knowledge and keen
          discernment, but is too liable to be swayed by his personal
          prejudices.

          His earlier style, as in the essays on Burns and Scott, was
          natural, simple, dignified, and vigorous. His later style is
          figurative, abrupt, enigmatical, sometimes turgid and involved,
          inverted, declamatory, and at times coarse, yet withal often
          beautiful, rich, and powerful, and always picturesque.

   Carlyle, Thomas
          CARLYLE, THOMAS: Apostle of the [769]Catholic Apostolic Church;
          b. at King's Grange (90 m. s.w. of Edinburgh),
          Kirkcudbrightshire, Scotland, July 17, 1803; d. at Albury (26 m.
          s.w. of London) Jan. 28, 1855. After studying at Edinburgh
          University he was called to the Scottish bar in 1824. The same
          year by the death of a relative the dormant title of Baron
          Carlyle passed over to him. In 1831 he figured as legal counsel
          of the [770]Rev. John McLeod Campbell in the famous Row heresy
          case. He believed that the revival in Scotland of the speaking
          in prophecy and tongues was a true work of the Spirit, and in
          Apr., 1835, was. himself called to the apostolate. Thereupon he
          gave up his practise at the bar and settled with his wife at
          Albury, where was the seat of the Apostolic College, and the
          center of its work. He was much in Germany, and made the
          acquaintance of many theologians, among them [771]H. W. J.
          Thiersch and C. J. T. Boehm. In 1845 he published at London The
          Moral Phenomena of Germany, which introduced him to King
          Frederick William IV. of Prussia. He wrote many pamphlets, among
          which may be mentioned Pleadings with my Mother, the Church of
          Scotland (1854). A volume of his collected writings was
          published in 1878.

   Carmel
          CARMEL: The mountain in the west of Palestine which separates
          the Plain of Acre front the Plain of Sharon. I Kings xviii.
          40-46 locates it near the Kishon and between the Mediterranean
          and [772]Jezreel; Joshua xix. 26 and Jer. xlvi. 18 locate it as
          the southern boundary of Asher and as abutting on the sea. Jabal
          Karmal is the name it still bears, and it is also called "Mount
          of the Holy Elijah." In the Hebrew the name has the article, and
          means "wooded garden," setting forth the contrast between the
          greenness of Carmel and the bareness of the hills of central
          Palestine.. This fact is often referred to in Scripture, the
          wooded Bashan, Lebanon, and Carmel being named together, though
          the bushy rather than forest growth of the last is sometimes
          noted.

          The mountain is wedge-shaped, with the edge toward the sea; the
          western extension turning toward the south runs approximately
          parallel to the coast, while the northern cliffs curve gently
          along the plain of the Kishon. Its stone is a gray limestone,
          and caves are numerous. It is about thirteen miles in length and
          eight and a half broad at its eastern end. It is marked off by
          the Wadi-al-Milh, emptying into the Kishon, and the
          Wadi-al-Matabin, which flows to the coast plain.

          The northern point is occupied by the convent of the Carmelites
          and a shelter provided for pilgrims. The situation affords an
          unobstructed view both of the coast to the south and of that to
          the north as far as Acre. There are at present only two villages
          on the mountain, both in the southern part and inhabited by
          Druses. In earlier times the mountain was more densely
          populated, as is shown by the remains of cisterns and oil- and
          wine-presses. In 1820 the Druses made seventeen settlements
          there, but in the Turco-Egyptian war all were destroyed but two.

          From its striking characteristics of position, form, and
          abundance of tree-growth, it is hardly to be wondered at that
          Carmel was a sacred place. I Kings xviii. connects this fact
          with the memory of Elijah. The site of the episode related there
          is given by tradition as El-Mahraka, "the Place of Burning," a
          terrace, 1,600 feet above the sea, where are a [Druse] chapel
          and some ruins. Beneath this on the bank of the Kishon is a
          little mound to which the name "Hill of the Priests" is given,
          pointed out as the place where the priests of Baal were slain.
          Tradition locates also the place where Elijah dwelt, in a
          valley, in which there is a spring known as Ain-al-Sih, about
          two miles south of the convent. The Mohammedans regard the place
          as sacred, and point out the site of Elijah's garden, where
          appear numbers of "Elijah's melons," geodes which characterize
          the Carmel formation. Near it the first monastery was built
          about 1200, replaced by a new one somewhat later, which was
          destroyed by Abdallah Pasha in 1821 that it might not be used as
          a fort by his enemies. It was reconstructed about 1828, and the
          church is built over an "Elijah-grotto"; that is, a cave in
          which Elijah is said to have lived.

          The Old Testament does not determine to which of the tribes
          Carmel belonged, whether to Asher, Zebulun, or Manasseh. At
          various times it was counted to Galilee and to Phenicia.
          Tacitus, asserts that "Carmel" was the name of a mountain and a
          deity, and Vespasian had the oracle there consulted.

          The coast at the foot of the mountain is about 100 yards wide,
          broadening north and south. At the foot of the bay of Akko there
          was an old city called Sycaminum by Greeks and Romans and Haifa
          in the Talmud, coins of which are known. The place was destroyed
          and the material used to build the present Haifa at the mouth of
          the Mahon, 1780, the growth of which in recent years has been
          quite rapid.

          Reforms Within the Order (§ 3).

          Present Status (§ 5).

    1. Origin and Early History.

          Carmelites (Ordo fratrum Beatæ Virginis Mariæ de monte Carmelo)
          is the name of a Roman Catholic order founded in the twelfth
          century by a certain Berthold (d. after 1185) on Mount Carmel,
          whence the order receives its name. Carmelite tradition traces
          the origin of the order to a community of hermits on Mount
          Carmel that succeeded the schools of the prophets in ancient
          Israel, although there are no certain records of monks on this
          mountain before the ninth decade of the twelfth century.
          Berthold, who had gone to Palestine from Calabria either as a
          pilgrim or as a crusader, chose Mount Carmel as the seat of his
          community because it was the traditional home of Elijah. It was
          but natural that this community of Eastern hermits in the Holy
          Land should gain constant accessions from pilgrims, and in 1209
          they received a rule from the patriarch Albert of Jerusalem.
          This consisted of sixteen articles, which enjoined strict
          obedience to their prior, residence in individual cells,
          constancy in prayer, the hearing of mass every morning in the
          oratory of the community, poverty and toil, daily silence from
          vespers until terce the next morning, abstinence from all forms
          of meat except in cases of severe illness, and fasting from Holy
          Cross Day (Sept. 14) to Easter of the following year. This rule
          received the approval of Honorius III. in 1226. With the
          increasing cleavage between the West and the East, however, the
          Carmelites found it advisable to leave their original home, and
          in 1238 they settled in Cyprus and Sicily. In 1240 they were in
          England, and four years later in southern France, while by 1245
          they were so numerous that they were able to hold their first
          general chapter at Aylesford, England, where Simon Stock, then
          eighty years of age, was chosen general. During his rule of
          twenty years the order prospered, especially by the
          establishment of a monastery at Paris by St. Louis in 1259.

    2. Habit and Scapular.

          The original rule of the order was now changed to conform to
          that of the mendicant orders on the initiative of Simon Stock
          and at the command of Innocent IV. Their former habit of a
          mantle with black and white or brown and white stripes was
          discarded, and they wore the same habit as the Dominicans,
          except that the cloak was white. They also borrowed much from
          the Dominican and Franciscan rules. Their distinctive garment
          was a scapular of two strips of gray cloth, worn on the breast
          and back, and fastened at the shoulders. This, according to the
          traditions of the order, was given to Simon Stock by the Virgin
          herself, who descended from heaven and promised that all who
          wear it in this world, or at least in the hour of death, should
          be saved, she herself going each Saturday to purgatory to rescue
          those to whom this might apply. Thus arose a sodality of the
          scapular, which affiliated a large number of laymen with the
          Carmelites. The order speedily became infected with arrogance,
          however, contesting the invention of the rosary with the
          Dominicans, terming themselves the brothers of the Virgin, and
          asserting, on the basis of their traditional association with
          Elijah, that all the prophets of the Old Testament, as well as
          the Virgin and the Apostles, had been Carmelites. Their second
          general, Nicholas of Narbonne (1265-70), protested in vain, only
          to be deposed from his office.

    3. Reforms Within the Order.

          In the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the Carmelites, like
          other monastic orders, declined, and reform became imperative.
          Shortly before 1433 three monasteries in Valais, Tuscany, and
          Mantua were reformed by the preaching of Thomas Conecte of
          Rennes and formed the congregation of Mantua, which, was
          declared independent of the order by Eugenius IV. In 1431 or
          1432 the same pope sanctioned certain modifications of the
          Carmelite rule, and in 1459 Pius II. left the regulation of
          fasts to the discretion of the general. Soreth, who was then
          general, and had already established the order of Carmelite nuns
          in 1452, accordingly sought to restore the primitive asceticism,
          but died of poison at Nantes in 1471. In 1476 a bull of Sixtus
          IV. founded the Carmelites of the Third Order, who received a
          special rule in 1635, which was amended in 1678. The sixteenth
          century saw a number of short-lived reforms, but it was not
          until the second half of the same century that a thorough
          reformation of the Carmelites was carried out by St. Theresa,
          who, together with St. John of the Cross, established the
          Discalced Carmelites. In conscious opposition to Protestantism
          the order was now inspired with an asceticism and a devotion
          hitherto unknown to it. In 1593 the Discalced Carmelites had
          their own general, and by 1600 they were so numerous that it
          became necessary to divide them into the two congregations of
          Spain and of Italy, or St. Elise, the latter including all
          provinces except Spain. Henceforth there were four Carmelite
          generals: the general of the Observantines, of the independent
          congregation of Mantua, and of the two congregations of the
          Diacalced Carmelites.

    4. Controversies with Other Orders.

          By the middle of the seventeenth century the Carmelites had
          reached their zenith. At this period, however, they became
          involved in controversies with other orders, particularly with
          the Jesuits. The special objects of attack were the traditional
          origin of the Carmelites and the source of their scapular. The
          Sorbonne, represented by Jean Launoy, joined the Jesuits in
          their polemics against the Carmelites. Papebroch, the Bollandist
          editor of the Acta Sanctorum, was answered by the Carmelite
          Sebastian of St. Paul, who made such serious charges against the
          orthodoxy of his opponent's writings that the very existence of
          the Bollandists was threatened. The peril was averted, however,
          and in 1696 a decree of Rocaberti, archbishop of Valencia and
          inquisitor-general of the holy office, forbade all further
          controversies between the Carmelites and Jesuits. Two years
          later, on Nov. 20, 1698, Innocent XII. issued a brief which
          definitely ended the controversy on pain of excommunication, and
          placed all writings in violation of the brief upon the Index.

    5. Present Status.

          The French Revolution and the sequestration of monasteries in
          southern Europe were heavy blows to the Carmelites. At the
          present time there are five provinces of Calced Carmelites
          (Rome, Malta, Iceland, England, and Galicia) and eight of
          Discalced (Rome, Genoa, Lombardy, Venice, Tuscany, Piedmont,
          Aquitaine, and Avignon), in addition to a number of isolated
          cloisters and priories of both Calced and Discalced Carmelites
          in various countries.

    1. Origin of the Caroline Books.

          "Caroline Books" is the name given to a criticism of the
          proceedings of the Second Council of Nicæa (787), which appeared
          under the name of Charlemagne toward the end of the eighth
          century. The acts of the council had been sent to Charlemagne in
          a very imperfect Latin version. Already displeased with the
          attitude of the Byzantine court and the equivocal policy of Pope
          Adrian I., he took occasion to have the whole question of the
          iconoclastic controversy and of the validity of the council's
          action discussed by his theologians, and sent on the report of
          its proceedings to King Offa in England, with a request for the
          opinion of his bishops. Alcuin, then in England, drew up their
          reply, and brought it to Charlemagne. It has been lost, and thus
          it is not now known in what relation it stands to the work which
          the emperor caused to be written about the same time (790 or
          soon after), and promulgated as having the assent of the bishops
          of his realm, under the title Opus inlustrissimi et
          excellentissimi seu spectabilis viri Caroli, nutu Dei regis
          Francorum . . . contra Synodum, quæ in partibus Græciæ pro
          adorandis imaginibus stolide et arroganter gesta est.

    2. Manuscripts and Editions

          The work, whose contents and spirit are sufficiently indicated
          by this title, consists of four books containing 120 chapters.
          It is preserved in two manuscripts, the Codex Parisinus and the
          Codex Vaticanus, the latter somewhat defective and apparently
          dating from the beginning of the tenth century. Two more were
          known in the sixteenth century, but have since been lost. One
          was said then to be extant in Rome, and a chapter from it was
          quoted by Steuchi, the papal librarian, in a polemical work
          against Laurentius Valla. The other, then extant in France, was
          the basis of the editio princeps of 1549, printed probably in
          Paris and edited by Jean du Tillet, later bishop of St. Brieux
          and of Meaux. This edition, which the subsequent ones followed,
          was used by the Protestants (Flacius, Calvin, Chemnitz, and
          others) in their attacks on the Roman Catholic Church, and,
          therefore, put on the Index by the popes from 1564, which
          accounts for its rarity. Of the subsequent editions the best is
          that published by Heumann in 1731, which makes use of all the
          materials at his command and gives the introductions and notes
          of previous editors. The less perfect edition of Goldast (1608)
          is followed in MPL, xcviii.

    3. Problem of Authorship.

          The authenticity of the work was denied by many of the older
          Roman Catholic theologians, such as Surius (who thought it a
          sixteenth-century forgery), Bellarmine, Suarez, Baronius, and as
          recently as 1860 by Floss of Bonn, who succeeded in convincing
          Baur that it was at least doubtful. But these doubts have long
          since been abandoned by Catholic theologians (the Jesuit
          Sirmond, Natalis Alexander, Du Pin, Hefele). The oldest external
          evidence in its favor is the letter of Adrian himself (printed
          by Mansi, Migne, and Jaffé); the next is that of Hincmar of
          Reims, who says he has seen the book in the imperial palace, and
          quotes a chapter (iv. 26) from it. If, however, the origin of
          the work from Charlemagne's immediate entourage and by his
          authority is indubitable, the question as to the actual author
          is still unsolved. This can not, of course, have been
          Charlemagne himself, though his name is used, but must have been
          one (if not more than one) of the most prominent theologians of
          his court. The majority of scholars are inclined to favor
          Alcuin; but there is some reason to think that it may have been
          Abbot Angilbert of St. Riquier, who stood in close relations to
          Charlemagne and was entrusted by him with negotiations at Rome
          regarding this controversy.

    4. The Work Sent to Pope Adrian.

          The composition of the work was begun, as appears from the
          preface to the first book, not earlier than the winter of
          789-790 and not later than the summer of 791. When it was
          completed is not now known, but Charlemagne was not likely to
          have granted his theologians more time than was necessary, so
          that it may have been finished in 790 or 791. It was intended to
          affect public opinion in favor of Charlemagne's rejection of the
          Nicene decrees. He endeavored to obtain like action from Pope
          Adrian, and sent Angilbert to Rome for this purpose. Adrian's
          answer referred to above discusses and controverts eighty-five
          chapters somewhat fully. The question arises whether Angilbert
          laid before him the whole work or only these chapters, and
          whether these eighty-five were the basis for a revised and
          enlarged edition, or a condensation of the larger work. A
          supplementary question also arises as to the date of Angilbert's
          mission, whether it was before or after the Synod of Frankfort
          in 794. The answer to the first question is determined by
          Adrian's assertion that he has answered each chapter seriatim,
          and by a similar assertion of the Council of Paris (825).
          Hincmar was probably in error when he said that the "not small
          volume" which he saw had been sent to Rome.

    5. Relation of Original Work to Larger Recension.

          The second question involves more difficulty. The theory,
          recently supported by Hampe, that Adrian's answer led to the
          expansion of the original document into the present Caroline
          Books is invalidated by the fact that in their present shape
          they contain no reference to Adrian's answer, and make no
          attempt to rebut it. It is more likely that the eighty-five
          chapters consisted of extracts from the larger work. Adrian was
          asked to condemn certain propositions, not to confirm
          Charlemagne's official pronouncement. As to the date of this
          proceeding, it must have been before the Synod of Frankfort,
          whose decision was taken in the presence of papal legates and
          its validity never questioned, while the rejection of the
          eighty-five chapters would have been tantamount to a
          condemnation of it. Angilbert was in Rome in 792, and the
          occurrence probably took place then--possibly not till the next
          year. In consequence Charlemagne laid the matter before the
          synod.

    6. Book I.

          We come now to the contents and character of the Libri Carolini.
          Each book has its own preface. That of Book I. begins with a
          rhetorical eulogy of the Church as the ark of safety,
          Charlemagne's duty to which leads him to take up this question.
          Pride and ambition have led the Eastern princes and bishops to
          introduce innovations into the true doctrine "by notorious and
          senseless synods." The Council of Constantinople (754) erred in
          one direction, by abolishing the pictures which had from of old
          served to adorn the churches and commemorate past events,
          referring what God had spoken of idols to images. The Nicene
          Council, on the other hand, three years before the date of
          writing, had erred not less, by exhorting the people to worship
          such images. Both perverted the teaching of the fathers, who
          allowed the possession of images, but forbade the worship of
          them. We, however, resting on the foundation of the Scriptures,
          the orthodox fathers, and the six ecumenical councils, reject
          all innovations, especially those of the Nicene Council, whose
          acts have reached us. We have undertaken to combat these errors
          with the assistance of the clergy of our kingdom. Neither of
          these councils deserves the name of ecumenical; and in contrast
          with both, the via media must be followed, which consists in
          neither breaking down the images nor worshiping them, but
          retaining them as ornaments and memorials, adoring God alone and
          rendering due veneration to the saints. The standpoint being
          thus set forth in the preface, the polemic of Book I. is
          directed first against the imperial summons to the Nicene
          Council, whose phraseology is condemned in four several points.
          The council itself is accused of erroneous exposition of the
          Scriptures and erroneous employment of patristic citations. The
          author thinks it necessary (i. 6) to express his acknowledgment
          of the authority of the Roman Church, both in faith and in
          worship, founded not on human ordinances but on divine
          prescription. The section i. 7-ii. 12 examines the passages of
          Scripture alleged by the council, and ii. 15-20 the patristic
          passages, some of which are not authentic and others
          inconclusive.

    7. Book II.

          In ii. 26 the conclusion is drawn that, as the whole of
          Scripture proclaims in thunder-tones, "God alone is to be
          worshiped and adored," the "cultus of images" is altogether to
          be reprobated, as contrary to the Christian religion; whether or
          not pictures are retained in the churches is a matter of
          indifference, though, indeed, visible memorials of Christ and
          the saints are unnecessary. The friends of images (obviously
          including the pope) are warned not to disturb the peace of the
          Church and the prosperity of Charles's kingdom by their
          councils. The apostles never taught the veneration of images by
          word or example; it is an error to compare them with the ark of
          the covenant, and an absurdity to place them in the same
          category with the eucharistic host; nor must they be likened to
          the cross of Christ, the sacred vessels, or the Scriptures, all
          of which are venerated in their own way and measure for
          different reasons.

    8. Book III.

          Book III. begins with a confession of faith, for the purpose of
          evincing the orthodoxy of the Frankish Church. This is supposed
          to be taken from Jerome, but is really almost verbally the
          profession of Pelagius (the Libellus fidei ad Innocentium of
          417), which throughout the Middle Ages was received as orthodox,
          under the name of Symbolum Hieronymi or Sermo Augustini. The
          author then attacks the patriarch Tarasius on the ground of the
          irregularity of his consecration and the error of his teaching
          on the procession of the Holy Ghost. The latter reproach and
          that of further doctrinal aberrations are brought against the
          other members of the council, and one chapter attacks the
          impropriety of the empress Irene's assumption of the teaching
          office. A special onslaught is made on a proposition assumed to
          have been uttered by one of the bishops which clearly rests upon
          a gross mistranslation. A distinction is drawn between images
          and relics; and even if it is true that some of the former have
          worked miracles, no adoration is therefor due them. Still less
          can dreams and visions, or absurd apocryphal inventions, be
          adduced in favor of the "adoration of images." Not this, but the
          keeping of the divine precepts, is the beginning of the fear of
          the Lord.

    9. Book IV.

          Book IV. continues the attack upon expressions of individual
          members of the council, and upon its authority as a whole. It
          can in no wise be compared with the First Nicene Council; that
          asserted the equality of the Son with the Father, while this
          places pictures on a level with the Trinity. Apart from all the
          unseemly, obscure, perverted, absurd, illogical, and
          untheological expressions to be found in the acts of the latter,
          it does not deserve the name of ecumenical given to it by the
          Greeks, because it neither utters the pure Catholic faith nor is
          recognized by all the churches.

    10. Characterization of the Caroline Books.

          The Caroline Books, then, in their fundamental conceptions,
          attempt to preserve the golden mean indicated by Gregory the
          Great in his letter to Serenus of Massilia: "We approve
          unreservedly because you have forbidden to worship them
          [images]; but we do not approve of their being broken; if any
          one wants to make images, at least forbid him; but shun in every
          way the worshiping of them." But their polemic (apart from its
          vehement, almost passionate tone) does material injustice to the
          Nicene Fathers by ignoring their distinction between latreia
          [worship] which is due to God alone, and proskunesis timetike;
          [honoring obeisance] which may be given to creatures, and in
          ascribing to them the blasphemous proposition that the same
          "servitude of adoration" is due to the images as to the Holy
          Trinity. This is explained by the imperfection of the version of
          the acts sent to Charles, which always renders the Greek
          proskunesis by adoratio, and by a particular misunderstanding or
          wrong reading already referred to.

    11. Importance of the Work.

          The work as a whole, however, may be taken as giving a good
          general view of Frankish and Anglo-Saxon theology in its day, of
          considerable importance for the dogmatic, exegetical, dialectic,
          and critical attainments of the age. Of special interest is the
          attitude assumed toward the great fundamental questions of
          medieval theology--the relations of Scripture and tradition,
          authority and reason, the Roman and the universal Church. In
          spite of all its recognition of the teaching authority of the
          Church, and particularly of the Roman Church, the work
          postulates the right of critical examination in a way seldom
          found in the Middle Ages--though it will not do to interpret
          this tendency in terms of modern views.

    12. Theological Standpoint.

          The theological standpoint of the book as a whole is that of
          Gregory the Great, a somewhat weakened Augustinianism which
          allows the author to accept the profession of Pelagiua as "the
          Confession of the Catholic Faith." He follows Gregory, as in the
          question of images, so also in the doctrines of original sin, of
          the replacing of the fallen angels by an equal number of
          redeemed men, of purgatory and prayers for the dead. Other
          patristic authorities cited are especially Augustine and Jerome,
          and sometimes Ambrose and Sedulius. The author attempts to show
          his universal culture by all sorts of grammatical, rhetorical,
          philosophical, historical, and literary remarks; by quotations
          from Plato and Aristotle, Vergil and Cicero, Macrobius and
          Apuleius, Cato and Josephus; and by the use of scientific
          terminology and logical formulas. The work, however, has not the
          character of a theological treatise written by a private person;
          it is a state document, an official protest on the part of the
          Frankish Church against Byzantine and Roman superstition and
          against the unjustified anathemas pronounced by both the Greek
          and the Roman Church on all who differed from them as well as on
          their own purer past.

    13. Later Influence of the Caroline Books.

          The effect of this protest can not here be followed out in
          detail. Adrian was clearly much disturbed by it, and sent his
          defense to Charlemagne with many conciliatory expressions,
          declaring that he had not as yet given an answer to the
          Byzantine emperor, because the latter still persisted in his
          usurpation of what belonged to the Roman See, but that he must,
          following the ancient tradition of his predecessors, condemn
          those who refused to venerate the sacred images. Charles's
          answer was the Synod of Frankfort, the presence at which of the
          papal legates betokened Adrian's submission. The pope died on
          Christmas day, 795, and the question slumbered until it came up
          once more, under Louis the Pious and Eugenius II., at the Synod
          of Paris in 825. This synod adhered to the position of the Libri
          Carolini and the Synod of Frankfort, venturing openly to condemn
          Adrian for encouraging superstition, though unconsciously, in
          the cultus of images. It was mainly through the influence of the
          Caroline Books that the Frankish Church excluded this cultus all
          through the ninth century. Even in the tenth we find the Nicene
          Council spoken of as "The pseudo-synod falsely called the
          Seventh," and the principle adopted that pictures are tolerated
          in the churches "only for the instruction of the ignorant,"
          without any attempt on the part of Rome to enforce its anathema.

          Charles and his theologians must thus have the credit of holding
          back for a time the influx of superstition into the West, while
          at the same time they asserted the rights of Christian art and
          its value for ecclesiastical decoration. When in the sixteenth
          century Tridentine Catholicism reaffirmed the proposition
          assailed in the Caroline Books, that veneration was paid not to
          the pictures but to their subjects ("honos refertur ad
          prototypa"), and on the other hand Swiss Protestantism, in its
          abhorrence of idolatry, renewed the tumults of iconoclasm, the
          Lutheran controversialists, especially Flacius and Chemnitz,
          with cheerful confidence "went back to the moderation of
          Charlemagne."

   Carpenter, Lant
          CARPENTER, LANT: English Unitarian; b. at Kidderminster (15 m.
          s.w. of Birmingham), Worcestershire, Sept. 2, 1780; lost
          overboard from a steamer between Naples and Leghorn Apr. 5,
          1840: He studied at Glasgow College 1798-1801; became a popular
          and successful school-teacher and preacher; was minister at
          Exeter 1805-17, and at Bristol 1817-39. He did much to broaden
          his denomination and to consolidate its scattered congregations;
          was a leader in philanthropic work; and was one of the most
          efficient of English schoolmasters. His publications were
          numerous, the most noteworthy being: An Introduction to the
          Geography of the New Testament (London, 1805); Unitarianism the
          Doctrine of the Gospel (1809; 3d ed., with alterations, Bristol,
          1823); Systematic Education, in collaboration with William
          Shepherd and Jeremiah Joyce (2 vols., 1815); An Examination of
          the Charges Made Against Unitarians by the Right Rev. Dr. Magee
          (Bristol, 1820); Principles of Education (London, 1820); A
          Harmony of the Gospels (Bristol, 1835). After his death appeared
          a volume of Sermons on Practical Subjects (Bristol, 1840),
          edited by his son, Russell Lant Carpenter.

          CARPENTER, MARY: Philanthropist; b. at Exeter, England, Apr. 3,
          1807; d. at Bristol June 14, 1877. She was the eldest child of
          [774]Lant Carpenter, and received an excellent education in her
          father's school; she taught for several years; became interested
          in reformatory movements in India through the visit to Bristol
          of the Rajah Rammohun Roy in 1833, and also in work for
          destitute children in England through the instrumentality of
          Joseph Tuckerman, of Boston. She opened "ragged schools" and
          developed and set in operation a plan for reformatory schools
          which was legalized by Parliament in 1854; she was also one of
          the chief promoters of the Industrial Schools Act passed in
          1857. She visited India four times between 1866 and 1876, and
          came to America in 1873. Prison reform also received her
          attention, and she was earnest in advocacy of the higher
          education of women. She wrote much in behalf of her projects,
          and her reports and memorials to Parliament had no little
          influence in shaping legislation.

   Carpenter, William Boyd
          CARPENTER, WILLIAM BOYD: Church of England bishop of Ripon; b.
          at Liverpool Mar. 26, 1841. He was educated at St. Catherine's
          College, Cambridge (B.A., 1864), and was ordered deacon in 1864
          and ordained priest in the following year. He was successively
          curate of All Saints', Maidstone, Kent (1864-66), of St. Paul's,
          Clapham (1866-67), and of Holy Trinity, Lee (1867-70). He was
          then vicar of St. James's, Holloway (1870-79), and of Christ
          Church, Lancaster Gate (1879-84). He was chaplain to the bishop
          of London from 1879 to 1884 and canon of Windsor from 1882 to
          1884, while he was also honorary chaplain to Queen Victoria in
          1879-83, and chaplain in ordinary in 1883-84. In 1884 he was
          consecrated the bishop of Ripon. He was select preacher at
          Cambridge in 1875 and 1877, and at Oxford in 1883-84, and was

          Oxford in 1887, Pastoral Lecturer on theology at Cambridge in
          1895, and Noble Lecturer at Harvard University in 1904. He has
          been a clerk of the closet since 1903, and is also a knight of
          the Prussian Order of the Royal Crown. In addition to numerous
          volumes of sermons, he has written: Thoughts on Prayer (London,
          1871); Narcissus, a Tale of Early Christian Times (1879); The
          Witness of the Heart to Christ (1879; the Hulsean Lectures for

   Carpocrates and the Carpocratians
          CARPOCRATES, c??r-pec´r?-tîz, AND THE CARPOCRATIANS: An
          Alexandrian Gnostic of the first half of the second century and
          the sect which he founded. His teachings rested upon a Platonic
          basis, and were interspersed with Christian ideas. According to
          Irenæus (Hær., i. 25), supplemented here and there by Epiphanius
          (Hær., xxvii.), he taught that in the beginning was the divine
          primitive source, "the father of all," "the one beginning " (Gk.
          arche). Angels, far removed from this source, have created the
          world. The world-builders have imprisoned in bodies the fallen
          souls, who originally worked with God, and now have to go
          through every form of life and every act to regain their
          freedom. To accomplish this a long series of transmigrations
          through the bodies is needed. The words of Jesus in Luke xii. 58
          (Matt. v. 25) expressed this thought very clearly in
          Carpocrates's view; the "adversary" is the devil, who drags the
          souls to the highest of the world-builders; the latter delivers
          them to another angel, his messenger, to be incarcerated in
          bodies until they have paid the last farthing, i.e., have won
          freedom, and can rise to the highest God. During their
          transmigrations the souls have retained the power of remembering
          (Gk. anamnesis), though in different degree. The soul of Jesus,
          son of Joseph, possessed the power of remembering God in
          greatest purity. Therefore God bestowed upon him power to escape
          the world-builders and to despise the Jewish customs in which he
          was brought up. Whosoever thinks and acts like him obtains the
          same power; whosoever is still more perfect can reach higher.
          This is the faith and the love through which we are saved;
          everything else, essentially indifferent, is good or bad,
          godless or shameless only according to human conceptions; for by
          nature nothing is bad. This is the teaching which Jesus himself
          gave to his disciples, "privately in a mystery," ordering them
          to disseminate it among the faithful ("the worthy and
          believing"). The Carpocratians rendered divine honor to Jesus as
          to the other secular sages (Pythagoras, Plato, Aristotle). They
          claimed for themselves the power of ruling the world-builders:
          magic arts, exorcism, philters and love-potions, dreams and
          cures were at their command, and like other secret societies
          they had a special mark of recognition, which they burned with a
          hot iron on the back of the lobe of the right ear.

          Later writers follow Irenæus. Clement alone adds new matter in
          some quotations from a Carpocratian manuscript. He says that
          Carpocrates had a son, Epiphanes, whose mother was Alexandria of
          Cephalonia; that this son became an author, died when seventeen
          years old, and was honored as a god at Same in Cephalonia. This
          story has been declared mythical (cf. Volkmar; in the
          Monatsschrift des wissenschaftlichen Vereins in Zürich, 1858,
          pp. 276-277; Lipsius, Zur Quellenkritik des Epiphanius, pp.
          161-162, Leipsic, 1865), and it is maintained that traits of the
          moon-god worshiped at Same (Gk. theos epiphanes) were
          transferred to Epiphanes, the Gnostic. Though this suggestion is
          striking, there is hardly reason for making a myth of the entire
          statement of Clement, so much the more as he has filled out his
          account by a long extract from a work of Epiphanes "On
          Righteousness." In this work the young idealist advocated
          community of goods and women without the intention of preaching
          general immorality. Even Irenæus had written: "I can hardly
          believe that all the ungodly, unlawful, and forbidden things of
          which we read in their books are really done among them." One
          needs only to reflect how inconsistently highly endowed
          advocates of similar views think and act nowadays, though of
          course it must be admitted that such conceptions in earlier
          times might have caused in immature minds the same troubles as
          they do to-day. At all events, Carpocratianism can not be called
          Christianity. It is a specifically ethnic phenomenon, easily
          explicable from the religious syncretism of the second century.

   Carpzov
          CARPZOV: A family of German lawyers and theologians, of which
          the following are the most important members:

          1. Benedikt Carpzov: Lawyer; b. at Wittenberg May 27, 1595; d.
          at Leipsic Aug. 30, 1666. He was educated at Wittenberg,
          Leipsic, and Jena, and after a tour through Italy, France, and
          England became a member of the court of sheriffs at Leipsic,
          where he remained with little interruption for forty years. He
          was later appointed assessor of the supreme court in Leipsic and
          counselor of the Dresden court of appeals. In 1645 he was made
          professor in the faculty of law at Leipsic, and was for eight
          years a member of the privy council of Dresden, but returned to
          Leipsic in 1661. Although he had not a creative mind, his
          diligence, judgment, and system enabled him to become the
          founder of German jurisprudence, and in his Practica nova
          imperialis Saxonica rerum criminalium (Wittenberg, 1638) he
          formulated the first system of German criminal law, while his
          Jurisprudentia ecclesiastica seu consistorialis (Leipsic, 1649)
          formed the earliest complete system of Protestant ecclesiastical
          law. He distinguished carefully between ecclesiastical and canon
          law, and was the first to use the ordinances of the Evangelical
          Church, the rescripts of the sovereigns, and the decisions of
          the consistories, thus summarizing the legal development of
          Protestantism since the Reformation.

          2. Johann Benedikt Carpzov the Elder: Theologian, brother of the
          preceding; b. at Rochlitz (16 m. n.n.w. of Chemnitz) June 22,
          1607; d. at Leipsic Oct. 22, 1657. He studied at the University
          of Wittenberg from 1623 to 1627, and then entered the University
          of Leipsic. In 1632 he was appointed pastor at Meuselwitz and
          five years later became deacon at the Church of St. Thomas at
          Leipsic. In ten years he rose to the archdeaconry and received
          the additional appointments of assessor of the consistory and
          canon, having become professor of theology at the university in
          1641, although his pastoral duties allowed him little time for
          teaching. He maintained a certain reserve in the syncretistic
          controversies of the period, and though in harmony with his
          colleague Hülsemann, he carried on a friendly correspondence
          with Calixtus and later with his pupil Titius. His most
          important work, which has won him the title of the father of
          symbolics, was his Isagoge in libros ecclesiarum Lutheranarum
          symbolicos (Leipsic, 1665), which was completed after his death
          by Olearius, general superintendent of Magdeburg. Still more
          famous, however, is his Hodegeticum brevibus aphorismis olim pro
          collegio concionatorio conceptum et nunc revisum (1656), which
          gives 100 methods of arranging sermons.

          3. Johann Benedikt Carpzov the Younger: Theologian, son of the
          preceding; b. at Leipsic Apr. 24, 1639; d. there Mar. 23, 1699.
          He was educated in his native city and at Jena, and was also
          influenced by Buxtorf in Basel and by Johann Schmid in
          Strasburg. In 1659 be became privat-docent at Leipsic, and in
          1665 was appointed professor of ethics. Three years later he was
          made licentiate of theology and professor of Oriental languages.
          In 1684 he became professor of theology, having already been
          made deacon in 1671, archdeacon in 1674, and pastor of St.
          Thomas's in 1679. His pastoral duties forbade extensive literary
          activity, and he therefore restricted himself to editing the
          works of others, such as the Jus regium of Wilhelm Schickhard
          (Leipsic, 1674), the In Prophetas Minores commentarius of Johann
          Tarnov (1688), the Horæ Talmudicæ et Hebraicæ of John Lightfoot
          (1674), and an enlarged edition of his father's Hodegeticum
          (1689). Through this last-named work an interest was aroused in
          homiletics which completely overshadowed philosophy and
          exegesis. There was gradually evolved, therefore, an antagonism
          between Carpzov and Spener, which increased in bitterness until
          in 1691 three programs assailed Pietism, and five years later
          Carpzov attacked Thomasius in his De jure decidendi
          controrversias theologicas (1696), vainly attempting to support
          a failing cause.

          4. Samuel Benedikt Carpzov: Theologian, son of Johann Benedikt
          the Elder; b. at Leipsic Jan. 17, 1647; d. at Dresden Aug. 31,
          1707. After studying philosophy and philology at the university
          of his native city from 1663 to 1668, he went to Wittenberg,
          where he became a close friend of Calov and Aegidius Strauch. In
          1674 he was called to Dresden as court-preacher, and five years
          later he was transferred to the Kreuzkirche, being also
          appointed superintendent and thus given the right to attend the
          sessions of the high consistory. He conducted the negotiations
          for the call of Spener, and proved himself a true friend of the
          Pietist until his brother at Leipsic became the leader of the
          opposition and persuaded him to change his attitude. After the
          retirement of Spener and the death of Green, Carpzov was chosen
          to succeed them, and he accepted with much hesitation, although
          he held the position for the remainder of his life.

          5. Johann Gottlob Carpzov: Theologian, son of the preceding; b.
          at Dresden Sept. 26, 1679; d. at Lübeck Apr. 7, 1767. He was
          educated at Leipsic and Altdorf, and though the most learned
          theologian of his family, was indoctrinated with reactionary
          principles by his father and uncle. In 1708 he went from Dresden
          to Leipsic as deacon. He ranked among the foremost of Old
          Testament scholars, although in the preface to his Introductio
          in libros Veteris Testamenti (Leipsic, 1721) he declared that
          only the entire absence of such a work had rendered it possible
          for him to publish his own. This book, like his Critica sacra
          (1728), is characterized by clear arrangement, deep knowledge,
          and thorough criticism. Equally valuable was his Apparatus
          historico-criticus antiquitatum Veteris Testamenti (1748). His
          chief attacks were reserved for R. Simon, Clericus, and Spinoza,
          as representatives of the new criticism, and his point of view
          was that of Buxtorf and Hottinger, so that he postulated the
          verbal inspiration of the text of the Bible, and admitted no
          error whatsoever. He was, moreover, a consistent opponent of
          Pietism and the Moravians, and gladly accepted a call as
          superintendent to the orthodox city of Lübeck in 1730, after
          having been obliged to decline a similar invitation to go to
          Danzig. There he continued his polemics against the Moravians,
          publishing in 1742 one of the sharpest of all attacks on them in
          his Religionsuntersuchung der böhmischen und mährischen Brüder
          von Anbeginn ihrer Gemeinden bis auf gegenwärtige Zeiten.

          6. Johann Benedikt Carpzov: Classical scholar and theologian,
          grandson of Johann Benedikt the Younger; b. at Leipsic May 20,
          1720; d. at Königslutter (9 m. w.n.w. of Helmstädt) Apr. 18,
          1803. He was educated at the university of his native city,
          where he was appointed associate professor in 1747, but was
          called in the following year as professor of Greek to Helmstädt,
          and in 1757 became abbot of Königslutter. Adhering to the
          orthodoxy of his family, he was commissioned by the duke to save
          the reputation of the university, endangered by the rationalism
          of Albrecht Teller, and he accordingly published his Liber
          doctrinalis theologiæ purioris (Brunswick, 1768). His
          philological learning was shown in his editions of the classics
          and in his Sacræ exercitationes in epistolam ad Hebræos ex
          Philone Alexandrino (Helmstädt, 1750); Stricturæ theologicæ in
          epistolam S. Pauli ad Romanos (1756); and Epistolarum
          catholicarum septenarius (Halle, 1790). His lectures, which he
          delivered in Latin, were devoted to classics, the New Testament,
          patristics, and Dolscius's Greek translation of the Augsburg
          Confession.

   Carranza, Bartolomé
          CARRANZA, c??r-r??n´th??, BARTOLOMÉ: Archbishop of Toledo; b. at
          Miranda (175 m. n.e. of Madrid), Navarre, 1503; d. at Rome May
          2, 1576. He entered the order of the Dominicans and from 1528
          lectured on philosophy and scholastic theology at Alcala,
          afterward at Valladolid. Charles V. offered him the bishopric of
          Cuzco in Peru, but he declined. At the request of the emperor he
          took part in the deliberations of the Council of Trent after
          1546, and insisted that the bishops should reside in their own
          dioceses. Strange to say, Carranza came into conflict with the
          Roman theologians because he asserted that the bishops had their
          rights jure divino, not by papal appointment. When the council
          was suspended he might have gone to Flanders as confessor of the
          infante Philip, but he declined this influential position to
          work in Spain as provincial of his order. He accompanied Philip
          to England (1554) when the latter was married to Mary Tudor, and
          shared in the persecution of the Protestants there. For this he
          was rewarded by Philip in 1557 and made archbishop of Toledo,
          which proved the culmination of his career. When Charles V. was
          dying (1558), Carranza gave him the sacrament. His opponents
          circulated the report that the emperor had not died in the faith
          of the Church and that this was owing to Carranza. The
          Inquisition had statements made by prisoners, which offered
          sufficient material to justify intervention, and his enemies,
          especially the inquisitor-general Valdez and Melchior Cano,
          called attention to his catechism (Comentarios del
          reverendissimo Fray Bartolomé Carranza sobre el Catechismo
          Christiano, Antwerp, 1558), which contained anything but
          Protestant doctrines, but deviated in some expressions from the
          Roman tradition. Carranza was imprisoned, his papers were
          confiscated, and some further material for charges was found.
          The examinations of Protestants in Valladolid which he held in
          1558 and 1559 were especially scrutinized, and it was found that
          on the doctrine of justification and purgatory he had made oral
          statements which were not Catholic. In spite of his appeal to
          the pope, the Spanish Inquisition kept him in prison eight years
          and when he was transferred in 1567 to Rome at the behest of
          Pius V. be was kept there under examination nine years longer.
          The Roman process ended with a solemn abjuration of fourteen
          statements especially taken from his writings and with canonical
          punishment. He was suspended for five years and died in Rome
          without returning to Spain. The court of inquisition had
          overcome in his person the highest episcopal dignitary, but
          Gregory XIII. allowed a laudatory epitaph to be set up in Santa
          Maria sopra Minerva.

          CARRASCO, c??r-r??s´co, ANTONIO: Spanish Protestant; b. in
          Malaga. Jan. 19, 1843; lost with the steamer "Ville du Havre"
          Nov. 22, 1873, while returning home from the Sixth General
          Conference of the Evangelical Alliance held in New York Oct.,
          1873. He was converted at sixteen and joined a band of
          Bible-readers in Malaga connected with [775]Manuel Matamoros;
          was imprisoned for two years (1860-62), and then condemned to
          the galleys for a term of nine years, but at the solicitation of
          the Evangelical Alliance, supported by representations of the
          Prussian government, the sentence was changed to banishment
          (1863). He studied theology in Geneva; on the downfall of Queen
          Isabella in 1868 he returned to Spain and undertook the work of
          evangelization; at the time of his death he was pastor of the
          Free Church in Madrid, with a membership of 700, and president
          of the Protestant Synod of Spain.

   Carroll, Henry King
          CARROLL, HENRY KING: Methodist Episcopalian; b. at Dennisville,
          N. J., Nov. 15, 1848. He was self-taught, and early entered
          journalism, being successively editor of the Havre Republican,
          Havre, Md. (1868-69), and assistant editor of The Methodist, New
          York (1869-70), and of the Hearth and Home, New York (1870-71).
          From 1876 to 1898 he was religious and political editor of The
          Independent, New York, but resigned in the latter year to accept
          the appointment of special commissioner of President McKinley to
          Porto Rico. In 1881 he was a delegate to the Ecumenical
          Methodist Conference in London, and in 1884 was organizing
          secretary of the Methodist Centennial Conference, of which he
          edited the proceedings (New York, 1885), while in 1890 he was
          special commissioner of the United States census for religious
          denominations. In 1900 he was elected corresponding secretary of
          the Methodist Missionary Society, and was reelected four years
          later. He is a member of the Methodist Historical Society, a
          manager of the Methodist Sunday School Union and of the American
          Sabbath Observance Society, and a trustee of the United Society
          of Christian Endeavor. In theology he is in thorough accord with
          the doctrinal position of the Methodist Episcopal Church. In
          addition to a number of minor contributions, he has written:
          Religious Forces of the United States (New York, 1893, 2d and
          enlarged ed., 1895).

          b. at Upper Marlborough, Prince George's County, Md., Jan. 8,
          1735; d. in Baltimore Dec. 3, 1815. He studied with the Jesuits
          at Bohemia, on the east shore of Maryland, and at the College of
          St. Omer, France; joined the Jesuits in 1753; was ordained
          priest is 1759; taught at St. Omer, Liége, and Bruges; traveled
          through Europe as tutor to the son of a Roman Catholic nobleman;
          returned to America in 1774 and became missionary and priest of
          his native region with headquarters at his mother's residence at
          Rock Creek, not far from Washington. Like his kinsman Charles
          Carroll of Carrollton, he warmly supported the cause of the
          colonies in the Revolutionary war. When the Roman Catholic
          Church in the United States was organized as a distinct body,
          free from the authority of the vicar apostolic of London, he was
          made prefect apostolic in 1784; in 1789 he was chosen bishop of
          Baltimore and consecrated in England in 1790; in 1808 he became
          archbishop. He founded Georgetown College in 1791.

          ordained a Presbyterian minister at Tobermore, near Coleraine,
          County Londonderry, 1798. After a few years he left the
          Presbyterians and published as justification of his action
          Reasons for Separating from the General Synod of Ulster
          (Edinburgh, 1804); a portion of his congregation followed him,
          and for ten years he preached in barns or the open air. A stone
          church was built for him in 1814. In the early part of his
          independent career, while studying the New Testament in order to
          confute the Baptists, he became a Baptist himself, and
          thenceforth advocated their views with the exception of close
          communion. His Baptism in Its Mode and Subjects Considered
          (Edinburgh, 1831; enlarged ed., 1844) is a Baptist classic. His
          other writings were numerous and treat topics of Bible
          interpretation, philosophy, doctrinal and practical theology,
          and the like. He was a bitter controversialist. His collected
          works were published in six volumes at Dublin, 1847-64.

          Cathcart (5 m. w.n.w. of Glasgow) Feb. 11, 1649; d. in Edinburgh
          Dec. 28, 1715. He studied at Edinburgh (graduated 1667) and at
          Utrecht, whither he went because of the political troubles at
          home, in which his father was implicated. Toward the close of
          1674 he was arrested in London, being suspected of having a hand
          in the distribution of a seditious pamphlet and of being the
          bearer of despatches to the disaffected in Scotland from their
          sympathizers in Holland; he was kept in confinement till Aug.,
          1679. When released he entered actively into the plots which
          were then rife, and appears at different times in Ireland,
          England, Scotland, and Holland. After the discovery of the Rye
          House plot (a scheme to assassinate Charles II.) in July, 1683,
          he was caught in Kent, and was sent to Edinburgh and examined
          under torture before the Scottish Council, but displayed "great
          discretion" in the disclosures which he made. In 1686 or 1687 he
          settled at Leyden, and thenceforth was seldom separated from
          William of Orange, whom he had known from his student days in
          Utrecht and who trusted him implicitly and often took his
          advice, especially on Scotch affairs. After William became king
          of England, he made Carstares chaplain for Scotland, and the
          latter rendered valuable services both to his country and his
          king, especially in reconciling the Scotch Presbyterians to the
          new regime. His personal influence at court ceased with the
          death of William, and thenceforth he resided in Edinburgh, where
          he was made principal of the university in 1703; he also became
          minister of the Gray Friars' Church, and distinguished himself
          in both capacities. He retained his position as royal chaplain
          under Anne, and at the accession of George I. was chosen by the
          General Assembly to make the usual congratulatory speech. He was
          four times moderator of the General Assembly.

   Carthage, Synods of

  CARTHAGE, SYNODS OF.

          I. Synods before and under Cyprian.

          II. Synods during the Donatist Controversy.

          III. Synods in Connection with the Pelagian Controversy.

          IV. Concluding Synods.

          Carthage, the ancient rival of Rome, preserved a remnant of its
          former greatness in the commanding position assumed by its
          bishops, at least from the beginning of the third century, in
          the North-African Church. By right of their see, they were ex
          officio primates of their province, while this position in
          Numidia, and later in the other provinces of North Africa, went
          by seniority. But many bishops of these provinces paid great
          heed to the counsels of the bishop of the capital, at least in
          Cyprian's time, and even earlier than that had formed the habit
          of meeting there for conference. The decisions taken in regard
          to the controversies agitating the African Church, especially
          the Donatist and Pelagian, were of permanent and far-reaching
          importance for the development of theology.

    I. Synods before and under Cyprian.

          (1) That under Bishop Agrippinus (c. 220), to whose decision
          Cyprian appealed in the controversy about baptism by heretics.
          (2) That held c. 240 at Lambese in Numidia (or Carthage), which
          condemned the heretic Privatus. (3) The first under Cyprian
          after his return to Carthage, just after Easter, 251. After a
          long debate, it decided that the lapsed, especially those who
          had offered sacrifice, should be restored only on an extended
          penance, except in danger of death, while the libellatici (see
          [777]Lapsed) might, provisionally at least, be at once received.
          It seems to have been customary at this time to hold an annual
          Easter synod; and at least one (4) is known in 252, to which
          probably the letter of Cyprian and sixty-six bishops to Fidus
          (Epist., lxiv.) refers; here Privatus attempted to have his case
          reopened, but was refused and joined the opposition that set up
          Fortunatus as a rival bishop. (5) In 253, with reference to the
          new persecution under Gallus, the procedure in the case of the
          lapsed was modified, so that, if truly penitent, they might be
          at once restored (Epist., lvii.). Subsequent synods dealt with
          baptism by heretics, concerning which the African bishops held
          strict views: (6) One attended by thirty-one bishops in 255
          (Epist., lxx.). (7) A more general one, of seventy-one bishops,
          from Numidia as well, in the spring of 256 ((Epist., lxxiii.).
          (8) One of eighty-seven bishops, this time including the
          Mauritanians, in September of the same year. The views expressed
          in the last-named were controverted by Augustine, De baptismo
          contra Donatistas, vi., vii.

    II. Synods during the Donatist Controversy.

          (1) In 312, composed of seventy bishops, opponents of Cæcilian,
          who was excommunicated. (2) One of 270 Donatist bishops, about
          330, which showed a conciliatory spirit, and sanctioned the
          admission of traditores to communion. The succeeding synods for
          some time are all on the Catholic side, and show a more or less
          severe attitude toward the Donatiats according to the position
          taken at the time by the schismatics. (3) The so-called "First
          Council of Carthage," between 345 and 348, attended by fifty
          bishops, at the close of a heavy persecution. This, like 8, 10,
          11, 15, and 20, dealt only cursorily with the Donatist question,
          while 4, 5, 6, 7, 9, and 18, as far as we know, did not touch
          upon it at all. Under Bishop Genethlius of Carthage, who was
          much esteemed by the Donatists, took place (4) a synod in the
          "Prætorium," and a year later, or in 390, (5) the so-called
          "Second Council of Carthage," attended by sixty bishops. Under
          his successor, Aurelius, twenty synods are said to have been
          held, in the most important of which Augustine participated. In
          a general African council held at Hippo in 393 it was decided
          that the various provinces should take turns in holding such
          general gatherings; but this system was difficult of execution,
          since Mauritania and Tripolis were too distant, and the latter
          had only five episcopal sees. Among such general councils may be
          reckoned, besides that of Hippo which began the series, that of
          Hadrumetum, 394, those numbered here 3, 5, 8, 11, 12, 15, and
          20, and that of Mileve, 402. In 407 it was decided to abandon
          the attempt and call them when and where it seemed expedient,
          while the provincial synods were to go on as before. (6) and (7)
          Two synods held respectively on June 26, 394, and June 26, 397,
          of which little is known.

          What is known as the Breviarium canonum Hipponensium corresponds
          substantially with (8) the Carthaginiense III. of the Spanish
          collection, Aug. 28, 397. The canons of 393 and 397, confirmed
          at Mileve in 402, give a comprehensive view of the church life
          of the time. The most famous is that containing the list of
          Scriptural books, and dealing with the reading of the
          martyrologies. The position of the presbyters in relation to the
          bishops is restricted, aggressions by bishops on neighboring
          dioceses reprobated, and the whole conduct of the clergy within
          the bounds of the Church regulated. In regard to the Donatist
          matter, a change is made, allowing clerics coming from the
          schism to exercise their function, under certain conditions,
          where formerly they had been relegated to lay communion.
          Legations from the court often appeared, as at (9) a synod of
          Apr. 27, 399, when the right of asylum in churches was
          considered. From 401 on more attention is paid to the Donatist
          controversy, at first in a conciliatory spirit; in that year two
          synods were held (10) on June 16 and (11) on Sept. 13, both of
          which occupied themselves also with the removal of the remains
          of paganism. (12) The general synod of Aug. 25, 403, laid down a
          formula to be accepted by the Donatists which only increased the
          bitterness, and the following synod (13) of June 16, 404,
          appealed to the emperor to repress the schismatics by legal
          measures. This was done, and the next synod (14), Aug. 23, 405,
          returned thanks to him. At the general synod (15) of June 13,
          407, measures were adopted to facilitate the reception into the
          Church of entire schismatic communities; and, after the issue of
          an imperial decree which mitigated the former severity, both on
          (16) June 16 and (17) Oct. 13, 408, delegations were sent to
          impress the ecclesiastical view on the emperor. The only extant
          provision of (18) the provincial synod of June 15, 409, has no
          direct connection with the burning question; but after the issue
          of a decree of toleration, the next (19), on June 14, 410, sent
          another delegation to the emperor, and this time with success.
          (20) The synod of May 1, 418, is occupied again with the
          reception of Donatist communities and the duty of the conversion
          of heretics; while some of its provisions look forward to the
          next division.

    III. Synods in Connection with the Pelagian Controversy.

          For these see [778]Pelagius, Pelagianism.

    IV. Concluding Synods.

          At the head of these comes the frequently cited synod of 419,
          attended by 217 bishops, which held two sessions, May 25 and 30
          (designated in the Hispana as Carthaginiense VI. and VII.). It
          codified and to some extent shortened the preceding legislation.
          Part of its work dealt with the claims of the Roman See, based
          improperly on the decrees of the First Council of Nicæa. It drew
          up also a reply to a letter of Pope Boniface, who had laid four
          points before it--the question of appeals, the journeys of the
          African bishops to the imperial court, the right of
          excommunicated clerics to apply for restoration to neighboring
          bishops, and the conduct of the bishop of Sicca, in deposing a
          priest who had appealed to Rome. The council temporized on the
          first and third points, agreed to the restoration of the priest,
          though not in the same diocese. A still firmer tone was taken
          toward Rome by the synod which (after 422) wrote to pope
          Celestine in connection with the priest above mentioned, which
          showed that the ancient independence and conciliar spirit of the
          African Church were still unbroken.

          But with the invasion of the Vandals from the west, threatening
          Carthage in 439, the existence of the Church of North Africa
          drew to a close. In the face of such dangers as the persecutions
          of the Arian kings brought upon the Christians of those parts,
          minor differences disappeared. The conference on religion held
          in 484 did not give them much relief; but more was accomplished
          by the synod of Feb. 5, 525, in the reign of Hilderic, attended
          by sixty bishops from different provinces. After the annexation
          of North Africa by the Byzantine government, Bishop Reparatus
          held a synod of 217 bishops in 535; it dealt with Rome about the
          reception of converted Arians into the service of the Church,
          regulated the relation of monasteries to the bishops, and sent a
          deputation to Justinian to ask the restoration of property and
          privileges. Thenceforth the history of the North-African Church
          is merged in the general development of the state religion, and
          has no more separate importance before its final extinction by
          the Arabs.

          Scholarship (§ 6).

          The Carthusians are a Roman Catholic order founded by St. Bruno
          of Cologne at Grande Chartreuse (14 m. n. of Grenoble) in
          Dauphiné in the latter part of the eleventh century. The period
          was particularly favorable to the formation of new monastic
          orders. The monastery of [779]Cluny inspired a tendency to the
          religious life throughout the surrounding regions, but this
          cloister, which had adopted the cenobitic monasticism of St.
          Benedict, gave no impetus to eremitic life. In the course of
          time, however, the longing for meditation in solitude peopled
          the wastes of Burgundy and Lorraine, apparently gaining
          inspiration from Italy by way of Dauphiné. To this period
          belonged Hugo, bishop of Grenoble (1080-1132), who had barely
          ascended the episcopal chair when he renounced it to bury
          himself in the monastery of Chaise-Dieu, whence he was recalled
          to his high office by the mandate of Gregory VII. In a like
          spirit two canons of St. Rufus in Dauphiné retired to the north
          of France, returning after some years with Bruno.

    1. The Life of St. Bruno.

          He was born of noble parentage at Cologne before the middle of
          the eleventh century, and educated at the cathedral school of
          Reims. Successively canon of St. Cunibert at Cologne and
          scholastic of the cathedral of Reims, Bruno had held this latter
          office with distinction for some twenty years and had diligently
          inculcated the stern principles of Hildebrand and the monks of
          Cluny. Appointed chancellor of the archbishopric of Reims in
          1075, Bruno relaxed his energies as a teacher to assail the
          simony of his own archbishop, Manasseh of Gourney (1067-80).
          After a long struggle, in which Bruno was seconded by the best
          element in his chapter, as well as by the neighboring clergy,
          Manasseh was deposed. His antagonist, however, had become
          disheartened with the condition of the Church. In equal despair
          regarding the theology to which he devoted himself, he resolved
          to abandon the world and live the life of a hermit. Where he met
          the two canons who were later to take him to the Chartreuse is
          uncertain, but at all events he retired with a few friends of
          like sympathies to Molesme in the diocese of Langres to live the
          life of an anchorite in the center of French asceticism. He
          there joined the adherents of Robert, then abbot of Molesme and
          later founder of the Cistercians, and with his permission
          established a small community of hermits in the neighboring
          Sêche-Fontaine. Feeling that this refuge was insufficiently
          sundered from the world, Bruno left all his followers but six in
          Sêche-Fontaine, pushed southward, and in 1084 reached Grenoble,
          where the little company was welcomed by Hugo, who had but
          recently resumed his episcopal office.

    2. Foundation of Chartreuse.

          Partly through the influence of the abbot of Chaise-Dieu, Bruno
          and his companions received from Hugo the lofty and almost
          inaccessible valley of Cartusia as their place of refuge, and on
          June 24, 1084, they began the construction of the hermitage,
          originally consisting of three wretched huts, each to be
          occupied by two anchorites, and a chapel. At first the new
          community had no special rule, although they seem to have been
          influenced by the Italian Camaldolites in many respects. They
          were clad in white, and were bound to perpetual silence, to the
          observance of the monastic hours, to the most rigorous
          renunciation and mortification, and to the copying of books of
          devotion. After directing his little colony of hermits for six
          years, Bruno was summoned to Rome by Urban II., who had once
          been his pupil at Reims. Bruno obeyed with reluctance, but went
          accompanied by some of his monks, while others remained in their
          hermitage, although for some time they proved restive under the
          administration of Landuin, whom Bruno had placed at their head.
          In Rome the hermits found themselves longing for their mountain
          valley, and Bruno obtained permission for them to return,
          bearing letters of commendation from the pope to Hugo of
          Grenoble and Hugo, archbishop of Lyons. Bruno, however, remained
          in Rome, although he was neither energetic enough nor polemical
          enough to exercise an influence on Urban's rule of the Church.

    3. Carthusians in Italy.

          He declined the proffered archbishopric of Reggio in Calabria,
          and shortly before the first crusade, apparently in 1091, he
          retired to the wild region of La Torre near Squillace in
          Calabria, where he gathered about him a number of hermits and
          formed a community like that at the Chartreuse. In 1097 Count
          Roger of Calabria gave him La Torre and Santo Stefano in Bosco,
          and two years later presented him with San Jacobo de Mentauro,
          so that he was able to establish two large cloisters for his
          order. He was buried in Santo Stefano in 1101, but the
          monastery, which then contained thirty monks, soon passed into
          the hands of the Cistercians, nor was it until 1137 that the
          Carthusian cloisters even reached the number of four, all
          situated in France.

    4. Growth of the Order.

          After the middle of the twelfth century the order steadily
          increased, and in 1170 the Carthusians were deemed worthy of the
          special protection of the pope and were officially recognized by
          Alexander III. In 1258 the monasteries of the order numbered
          fifty-six, but in 1378 the Carthuaians were obliged to contend
          with a division corresponding to the papal schism and lasting
          until the Council of Pisa. The entire body of Carthusians
          recognized Martin V. as pope, and the two generals of the order
          resigned in favor of John of Greiffenberg, the prior of the
          Carthusian monastery of Paris, who thus became sole general. In
          1420 Martin V, granted the order exemption from tithes for all
          its estates, and in 1508 Julius II. issued a bull enacting that
          the prior of the mother house should always be the general of
          the order, and that the annual chapters should be held there.
          Five years later the Calabrian monastery of Santo Stefano, where
          the founder of the order was buried, was restored to the
          Carthusians, and in 1514 Bruno was canonized. At the beginning
          of the eighteenth century the Carthusian monasteries numbered
          170, of which seventy-five were in France. The Revolution struck
          the order a heavy blow, but it survived and in 1819 the mother
          house near Grenoble was again occupied. In 1905, in consequence
          of the legislation enacted in France concerning religious
          orders, the Grande Chartreuse of Grenoble as well as the other
          Carthusian monasteries was again vacated, and most of the monks
          retired to Spain.

    5. Organization.

          The Carthusian spirit may be learned from its rule. Until 1130
          the order had no special regulations, but in that year Guigo de
          Castro, the fifth prior of Chartreuse, prepared the
          Consuetudines Cartusiæ. In 1258 the resolutions of the chapters
          from 1141 were collected by Bernard de la Tour and designated
          Statuta antiqua, while additional collections were made in 1367,
          1509, and 1581. The chief aim of them all was the most absolute
          detachment, not only from the world and all its attractions and
          interests, but even from the brother monks of the order and the
          monastery. The lay brothers, who are divided into the three
          classes of conversi, donati, and redditi, are sharply
          distinguished from the professed. Each monastery is strictly
          separated from the surrounding population and from all other
          orders, while every form of ecclesiastical and secular
          influence, whether active or passive, is carefully avoided. The
          faithful adherence of the Carthusians to their rule spared them
          the necessity of reform felt by many orders in the transition
          from the Middle Ages to modern times.

          The Carthusians now control twenty-six monasteries, and still
          retain their absolute retirement from the world. The order
          likewise includes Carthusian nuns, who are said to have existed
          as early as the twelfth century, although in the eighteenth only
          five nunneries were known, all dating from the thirteenth or
          fourteenth century. Over these convents Carthusian monks
          presided, who as vicars ranked above the prioresses and lived in
          separate houses with other professed and lay brothers. The nuns,
          who were first permitted to become professed by the Council of
          Trent in the sixteenth century, may eat together and converse
          more frequently than is allowed to the monks.

    6. Scholarship.

          Although in scholarship the Carthusians can not rival the
          Benedictines, Dominicans, or Jesuits, they are not without their
          men of fame. From the pre-Reformation period mention may be
          made, in addition to the Guigo already noted, of such authors of
          the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries as Ludolf of Saxony,
          Hendrik of Coesfeld, Gerhard of Schiedam, and Henry of Kalkar,
          as well as of Jacob of Jülterbogk and Dionysius of Rickel.
          Noteworthy names of later date are the hagiographers Lorenz
          Surius and H. Murer, and such historians of the order as
          Petræus, Le Vasseur, and Le Couteulx. In recent times, moreover,
          the order entered upon a revival of literary activity.

          Tennessee, and forty-eight in the Illinois. He is said to have
          received more than 10,000 members into the Church, baptized more
          than 12,000 persons, and preached more than 15,000 sermons. He
          was known as the "backwoods preacher," and it is reported that
          when moral suasion proved ineffective with the rough characters
          with whom he had to deal he was able and willing to quiet them
          by physical force. He was once a member of the Illinois

          1846.

    1. Leader of the Puritan Party.

          Thomas Cartwright, English Puritan and Presbyterian, was born in
          Hertfordshire 1535; d. at Warwick Dec. 27, 1603. He was
          matriculated as a sizar of Claire Hall, Nov., 1547, and as a
          scholar at St. John's College, Cambridge, Nov. 5, 1550. Being a
          Protestant and refusing to return to the Roman Church, he was
          debarred from the university during Mary's reign (1553-59). In
          1560 he became a minor fellow of Trinity College, and on Apr. 6
          of the same year a fellow of St. John's College; in Apr., 1562,
          a major fellow of Trinity College. In 1567 he took his
          bachelor's degree, and in 1569 was chosen Lady Margaret
          professor of divinity, and began to lecture on the Acts of the
          Apostles. His lectures were exceedingly popular, and made a
          profound impression in favor of his distinctively Puritan views,
          but created a storm of opposition from the Prelatical party,
          headed by Dr. Whitgift. This conflict, under these two great
          champions, continued to grow more and more severe, and was
          continued by their successors in two great parties in the Church
          of England--the Presbyterian and the Prelatical. The Puritan
          platform is well stated in the six propositions which Cartwright
          delivered under his own hand to the vice-chancellor, the grounds
          of his persecution by the Prelatists:

          1. That the names and functions of archbishops and archdeacons
          ought to be abolished. 2. That the offices of the lawful
          ministers of the Church, viz., bishops and deacons, ought to be
          reduced to their apostolical institution: bishops to preach the
          word of God, and pray, and deacons to be employed in taking care
          of the poor. 3. That the government of the Church ought not to
          be entrusted to bishop's chancellors, or the officials of
          archdeacons; but every church ought to be governed by its own
          ministers and presbyters. 4. That ministers ought not to be at
          large, but every one should have the charge of a particular
          congregation. 5. That no man ought to solicit, or to stand as a
          candidate for the ministry. 6. That ministers ought not to be
          created by the sole authority of the bishop, but to be openly
          and fairly chosen by the people.

    2. Controversial Writings.

          Having been deprived of his professorship Dec. 11, 1570, and of
          his fellowship at Trinity College in Sept. 1571, Cartwright went
          to the Continent, and in Geneva conferred with Beza and other
          chiefs of the Reformed Churches. He was prevailed upon by his
          friends to return in Nov., 1572. An Admonition to Parliament for
          the Reformation of Church Discipline had been issued by his
          friends John Field and Thomas Wilcox, for which they had been
          cast into prison. Cartwright espoused their cause, and issued
          The Second Admonition, with an Humble Petition to Both Houses of
          Parliament for Relief Against Subscription, 1572. Whitgift
          replied in An Answere to a Certen Libell, Intituled An
          Admonition to the Parliament, 1572. Cartwright rejoined in A
          Replye to an Answere Made of M. Doctor Whitegifte Againste the
          Admonition to the Parliament, 1573. This was a renewal of the
          old discussion on a larger scale, going to the roots of
          difference; Cartwright and the Puritans contending that the
          church government and the discipline, as well as the doctrine,
          must be reformed according to the Scriptures. The discussion
          took a wide range--as to the standard of church government, the
          choice of ministers, the offices of the Christian Church,
          clerical habits, bishops, archbishops, the authority of princes
          in matters ecclesiastical, confirmation, etc. Whitgift replied
          in A Defense of the Ecclesiasticall Regiment in Englande Defaced
          by T. C. in his Replie againste D. Whitgifte, 1574, and also The
          Defense of the Answere to the Admonition, against the Replye of
          T. C., 1574, pp. 812, folio.

    3. Minister in Antwerp.

          An order for Cartwright's apprehension was issued Dec. 11, 1574;
          but he fled to the Continent, and became minister of the English
          congregation of merchants at Antwerp and Middelburg. In 1576 he
          went to the isles of Jersey and Guernsey, aided the Puritans
          there in settling the discipline of their churches, later
          returning to Antwerp, where he preached for several years. While
          abroad, he wrote the Second Replie of Thomas Cartwright Agaynst
          Maister Doctor Whitgiftes Second Answer Touching the Churche
          Discipline, 1575, and also The Rest of the Second Replie, 1577.
          He, in 1574, prepared also a preface to the Latin work of
          William Travers, and translated it under the title A Full and
          Plaine Declaration of Ecclesiasticall Discipline owt off the
          Word off God and off the Declininge off the Churche off England
          from the Same, 1574, which still more embittered his foes. In
          1583, at the solicitation of the Earl of Leicester, and Lord
          Treasurer Burleigh, and a large number of Puritan friends, he
          undertook to write a confutation of the Rhemish version of the
          Scriptures, which took him many years; but he was prevented by
          the ecclesiastical authorities of England from publishing his
          work. The year before his death, however, his Answere to the
          Preface of the Rhemish Testament, 1602, was issued; but the work
          itself, not until 1618, under the title A Confutation of the
          Rhemists Translation, Glosses, and Annotations on the New
          Testament, so farre as they containe Manifest Impieties,
          Heresies, Idolatries, etc., fol., pp. lviii., 761, xviii.,
          Leyden. In 1584 he was invited to the divinity chair in St.
          Andrews, Scotland, but declined.

    4. Again in England.

          In 1585 Cartwright returned to England without the royal
          permission, and was apprehended by Bishop Aylmer of London and
          cast into prison, where he remained from April until June, when
          he was released through the influence of his powerful friends,
          and the Earl of Leicester appointed him master of a hospital
          which he had founded at Warwick. His preaching was opposed by
          his enemies, but without success, until 1590. During this time
          he went over a great part of Proverbs and Ecclesiastes. The
          latter was published in 1604 under the title Metaphrasis et
          homiliæ in librum Solomonis, qui inscribitur Ecclesiastes, 4to;
          the former in 1617, Commentarii succincti et delucidi in
          Proverbia Solomonis, 4to. He is said to have been the first
          preacher in England who practised extempore prayer before
          sermon, although he usually employed forms of prayer. During
          this period the ecclesiastical conflicts waxed hotter and
          hotter. The Puritans had been making rapid progress. The first
          presbytery was organized at Wandsworth within the Church of
          England in 1572. Classes were rapidly organized in all parts of
          England, but secretly. In 1583 a rough draft of a book of
          discipline was drawn up by Thomas Cartwright and Walter Travers,
          and at an assembly held either at London or Cambridge it was
          resolved to put it in practise. It was revised at a national
          synod in London (1584), and referred to Mr. Travers "to be
          corrected and ordered by him." It was then passed around the
          various classes. It was adopted and subscribed by an assembly of
          all the classes of Warwickshire in 1588, and then by a
          provincial synod in Cambridge; and by 1590 the Directory had
          spread all over England, and was subscribed to by as many as 500
          ministers. The episcopal party were greatly alarmed, and
          determined to arrest Cartwright with the other leaders and to
          destroy as large a number of copies of the Holy Discipline as
          possible. A few copies were, however, preserved, two copies in
          manuscript, one in the British Museum, another in Lambeth
          Palace, in Latin, entitled Disciplina ecclesiæ sacra. These were
          discussed and the Lambeth manuscript published by F. Paget in
          his Introduction to the Fifth Book of Hooker's Treatise, London,
          1899, pp. 238 sqq. An edition in English with slight
          modifications was issued in 1644 by authority of the Long
          Parliament, entitled A Directory of Church Government anciently
          contended for, and as farre as the Times would suffer, practised
          by the first Non-Conformists in the Daies of Queen Elizabeth.
          Found in the study of the most accomplished Divine, Mr. Thomas
          Cartwright, after his decease; and reserved to be published for
          such a time as this.

    5. Attitude Toward the Brownists.

          The discussion between the Presbyterians and the Prelatists was
          complicated by the Brownist party and the [780]Marprelate
          tracts, which bitterly satirized the bishops. Cartwright took
          strong ground against the Brownists and their doctrine of
          separation, and opposed the Marprelate method of controversy;
          but it was the policy of the Prelatists to make the Puritans
          bear all the odium of the weaker and more obnoxious party.
          Manuscripts of Cartwright against the Brownists are preserved
          and lately published (see [781]Browne, Robert). In May, 1590, he
          was summoned before the High Commission, and committed to the
          Fleet. He and his associates were confronted with thirty-one
          articles of charges, afterward increased to thirty-four, besides
          articles of inquiry. He was willing to reply to the charges, but
          refused to give testimony against his brethren. He was then
          summoned before the Star Chamber with Edmund Snape and others;
          but the case never reached an issue. Powerful friends worked in
          his behalf, and he was finally released from prison in 1592, on
          the promise of quiet and peaceable behavior, in broken health.
          From 1595 to 1598 he lived on the island of Guernsey, and
          afterward at Warwick. To a bitter attack, he wrote A Brief
          Apologie of Thomas Cartwright against all such slaunderous
          Accusations as it pleaseth Mr. Sutcliffe in his Severall
          pamphlets most injuriously to load him with, etc., 4to, pp. 28,
          1596. In the main, the Presbyterian churches of Great Britain
          and America still stand by his principles.

          Other works besides those mentioned in their historical
          connections were published after Cartwright's death by his
          disciples: A Catechisme, 1611; A Treatise of the Christian
          Religion, 1611 (anonymous), 2d ed., 4to, 1616, edited by William
          Bradshaw; A Commentary on the Epistle to the Colossians, 1612;
          Harmonia Evangelica, Amsterdam, 4to, 1627; Commentaria Practica
          in totam Historiam Evangelicam, 1630, 3 vols., 4to. See also

          He was educated at the universities of Tübingen, Greifswald, and
          Strasburg (Ph.D., Tübingen, 1876), and after teaching in two
          realgymnasia in Dresden and in the Royal Saxon Cadet Corps, he

          translated the Chinese texts of Lâo-tse's Tao-Teh-King (Chicago,
          1898), as well as the Kan Ying P'ien (1906) and the Yin Chih Wen
          (1906).

   Cary, Alice
          CARY, ALICE: Poet and hymn-writer; b. on a farm 8 m. n. of
          Cincinnati Apr. 26, 1820; d. in New York Feb. 12, 1871. Her name
          is inseparably connected with that of her sister, Phoebe, b.
          Sept. 4, 1824; d. at Newport, R. I., July 31, 1871. Both began
          to write verses early and published jointly a volume of Poems in
          1850. In 1850-51 they removed to New York, where they supported
          themselves by literary work and gathered a wide circle of
          friends. Alice was the more productive writer and published
          stories and novels as well as poems. Ballads, Lyrics, and Hymns
          (Boston, 1865) is her most important volume of verse. Phoebe
          published independently Poems and Parodies (1854) and Poems of
          Faith, Hope, and Love (1868); with Dr. Charles F. Deems she
          compiled Hymns for all Christians (1869). The poems of both
          sisters are collected in the "Household Edition" (Boston, 1882)
          and Early and Late Poems (1887). The most familiar of their
          hymns is Phoebe's "One sweetly solemn thought comes to me o'er
          and o'er."

   Cary, George Lovell
          CARY, GEORGE LOVELL: Unitarian; b. at Medway, Mass., May 10,
          1830. He was educated at Harvard College (B.A., 1852), and was
          acting professor of Greek in Antioch College, Yellow Springs,
          O., in 1856-57, being appointed full professor of Greek and
          Latin in the following year and serving in this capacity until
          1862. In the latter year he was made professor of New Testament
          language and literature in Meadville Theological School, where
          he remained until 1902, when he became professor emeritus. He
          was also acting president of the institution in 1890-91 and
          president in 1891-1902. His theological position is, in general,
          that of modern Unitarianism. He has written: An Introduction to
          the Greek of the New Testament (Andover, Mass., 1878) and The
          Synoptic Gospels, Together with a Chapter on the Text-Criticism
          of the New Testament (New York, 1900).

          Church, Oxford (M.A., 1796), took orders, and became vicar of
          Abbot's Bromley, Staffordshire. In 1800 he removed to Kingsbury,
          Warwickshire, and after 1807 lived in London. He was assistant
          keeper of printed books in the British Museum, 1826-37. His
          translation of Dante was begun in May, 1800, and finished twelve
          years later; the Inferno was published in 1805 and the completed
          work in 1814. It attracted little attention at first, but was
          commended by Coleridge in his lectures in 1818, and Southey
          afterward pronounced it "one of the most masterly productions in
          modern times." Four editions were issued during Cary's life, and
          it still remains the standard translation in English blank
          verse.

          and became preacher at Lincoln's Inn; was appointed minister of
          St. Magnus' Church near London Bridge, 1645; ejected by the Act
          of Uniformity, 1662, but gathered a new congregation and
          continued to preach in the same neighborhood. He was a member of
          the Westminster Assembly and one of the triers for the
          approbation of ministers in 1653. He is remembered for his
          Exposition with Practical Observations on the Book of Job (12
          vols., 4to, London, 1664-66; 2d ed., 2 vols., folio, 1676-77;

          priesthood in 1860. Six years later he was appointed chamberlain
          by Pope Pius IX., and was then canon successively of the Lateran
          (1867-71) and of St. Peter's (1871-78). In 1878 he became
          domestic prelate, and in 1895 Leo XIII. created him titular
          Latin patriarch of Constantinople. He received the cardinal's
          hat in 1899, being created cardinal priest with the title of
          Santa Maria della Victoria.

          Geneva Feb. 18, 1559; d. in London July 12, 1814. His father was
          a poor Huguenot preacher, who could give his son little
          education, nevertheless he came to be considered the most
          learned man in Europe after Joseph Scaliger. He was professor of
          Greek at Geneva, 1582-96, at Montpellier, 1596-99; in 1600 he
          went to Paris, where he might have been professor in the
          university if he had embraced Roman Catholicism; this, however,
          he refused to do, although he offended the rigid Calvinists by
          denying their extreme positions. He was given a pension by Henry
          IV. (1600), and in 1604 became sublibrarian of the royal
          library. In 1610 he went to England, where he was well received
          by King James and the Anglican bishops and was made prebendary
          of Canterbury and Westminster. His works belong for the most
          part to the field of classical scholarship, but he edited a
          Greek New Testament (Geneva, 1587), and published some minor
          pamphlets of theological interest; his criticism of the Annales
          of Baronius, begun at the request of King James, was left
          unfinished. His letters (in Latin), with life, were published by
          d'Almeloveen (Rotterdam, 1709); his diary, Ephemerides, ed.
          Russell, was printed at Oxford, 1850.

   Caselius, Johannes
          CASELIUS, c??-sê´li-Us, JOHANNES, yO-h??n´es: German scholar; b.
          at Göttingen 1533; d. at Helmstädt Apr. 9, 1613. He belonged to
          the Dutch family of Chessel, which during the Reformation period
          had emigrated on account of its faith. His father, Matthias
          Bracht von Chessel, found a refuge at Göttingen and became a
          teacher there. Johannes studied at Wittenberg under Melanchthon
          and at Leipsic under Joachim Camerarius. Under their guidance he
          became one of the most distinguished humanists of Germany; he
          was made a doctor of law at Pisa in 1566, and was ennobled in
          1567 by the emperor Maximilian II. From 1563 to 1589 he labored
          at Rostock and then accepted a call to Helmstädt. He enjoyed
          there the favor of his prince, Duke Henry Julius of Brunswick,
          and the fame of his learning made him a kind of European
          celebrity. But the orthodox theologians in the university, who
          opposed Melanchthonianism, soon attacked Caselius. The leader of
          the orthodox was [784]Professor Daniel Hoffmann, who considered
          all use of reason and philosophy in theology as dangerous,
          because the revealed truth is injured thereby. In this and
          similar tendencies Caselius saw the approach of a new barbarism,
          and he was not far wrong. He had the encouragement of a few
          bright pupils, including the young [785]Georg Calixtus, and
          comforting messages came to him from friends abroad. But
          unfortunately his material circumstances became more and more
          wretched, and for this reason his life ended in discord and
          darkness. In the barbarism which came over Germany with the
          Thirty Years' War his numerous writings, distinguished by
          spirited contents and elegant form, were soon almost forgotten.
          As far as they are printed, they can only be found in larger
          libraries. They refer to Greek authors, ancient grammar,
          hermeneutics, and rhetoric, as well as to pedagogics and
          political science. Caselius was the first to separate political
          science from the Roman jurisprudence and raise it to a distinct
          discipline.

   Caspari, Carl Paul
          CASPARI, c??s´p??-rî, CARL PAUL: Norwegian Lutheran; b. at
          Dessau Feb. 8, 1814; d. at Christiania Apr. 11, 1892. He was of
          Jewish parentage and was brought up in the faith of his fathers.
          From 1834 to 1838 he studied at Leipsic, where he acquired a
          knowledge of Arabic and Persian under Fleischer. Partly from the
          influence of fellow students, among whom was Franz Delitzech, he
          adopted Christianity and was baptized in 1838. His Jewish
          training naturally fitted him for work in Old Testament
          exegesis, and he spent two years at Berlin under Hengstenberg.
          In 1842 he became doctor of philosophy at Leipsic, and in 1847
          he accepted a call to Christiania, where he remained from choice
          the rest of his life, declining calls to Rostock is 1850, to
          Dorpat in 1856, and to Erlangen in 1857 and again in 1867. His
          linguistic ability enabled him speedily to master the Norwegian
          language, so that he could begin lectures in less than a year.
          He was made full professor in 1857. In his university work
          Caspari interpreted various books of the Old and New Testaments
          and treated Old Testament introduction. His lectures were
          inspiring, thorough, earnest, and bore evidence of a living
          Christian faith. In his exegesis and apologetics he followed
          Hengstenberg, and he remained to the end an opponent of modern
          critical scholarship. But his work and interest were not
          confined to the Old Testament field. In 1825 a Danish preacher,
          [787]Nicolai Frederik Severin Grundtvig, propounded peculiar
          views, viz., that the baptismal formula, the renunciation, the
          Lord's Prayer, and the words of the Lord's Supper come directly
          from the Lord, have never been changed, and therefore stand
          above the Scriptures. The view found adherents in Denmark and
          Norway, and fear was felt that the formal principle of the
          Lutheran Church was in danger. Caspari undertook a careful
          investigation of the questions connected with the baptismal
          formula, and its history and thus was led on to extensive
          ecclesiasticopatristic studies. He published a long series of
          articles and books as the result, most of them in the Norwegian
          language. Under the auspices of the Norwegian Bible Society he
          assisted in making a new translation of the Old Testament, which
          was completed for the seventy-fifth anniversary of the Society,
          May 26, 1891; at the time of his death he was working on the New
          Testament (see [788]Bible Versions, B, XV., § 2). He was a
          member of the central committee of the Bible Society, president
          of the Norwegian mission among the Jews, and belonged to
          numerous learned and honorary societies.

          His most important publications were: A commentary on Obadiah
          (in Delitzech and Caspari's Exegetisches Handbuch zu den
          Propheten des Alten Bundes, Leipsic, 1842); Grammatica Arabica

          chapters of Isaiah (1867); a historical essay on the confession
          of faith at baptism (1871); on Abraham's trial and Jacob's
          wrestling with God (1871); on Abraham's call and meeting with
          Melchizedek (1872); a volume of Bible essays (1884); etc. With
          his friend [789]G. C. Johnson he established in 1857 the
          Theologisk Tidskrift for den evangelisk-lutherske Kirke i Norge,
          of which a volume appeared annually till shortly before
          Caspari's death. Most of the articles were written by the
          editors, and in this and other periodicals a large number of
          Caspari's writings were originally published.

   Caspari, Walter
          CASPARI, WALTER: German theologian; b. at Sommerhausen (a
          village of Lower Franconia) June 19, 1847. He was educated at
          the universities of Munich, Erlangen, and Leipsic from 1864 to
          1868, after which he was pastor in Memmingen and Ansbach until
          1885. In the last-named year he was appointed associate
          professor of practical theology, pedagogics, and dogmatics, and
          university preacher at Erlangen, and became full professor two
          years later. In addition to contributions to the Hauck-Herzog RE
          and briefer studies, he has written: ausgewählte Lesestücke der
          ausländischen Literatur (Munich, 1877); Die epistolischen
          Perikopen nach der Auswahl von Dr. Thomasius
          exegetisch-homiletisch erklärt (Erlangen, 1883); Die
          evangelische Konfirmation (Leipsic, 1890); and Die
          geschichtliche Grundlage des gegenwärtigen evangelischen
          Gemeindelebens (1894).

   Cassander, Georgius
          CAS-SAN´DER, GEORGIUS: Roman Catholic theologian; b. at Pitthem
          (15 m. s.e. of Bruges) Aug. 24, 1513; d. in Cologne Feb. 3,
          1566. He lectured at Bruges and Ghent on antiquities, theology,
          and canon law, but retired to Cologne in 1549 and devoted
          himself to study. The Duke of Cleves employed him in an effort
          to win back the Anabaptists in Duisburg, and still more
          important was the charge of the Emperor Ferdinand I., who
          endeavored to unite the Catholics and Protestants in his
          territories. Cassander had already published anonymously an
          irenic writing, De officio pii ac publicæ tranquillitatis vere
          amantis viri in hoc religionis dissidio (Basel, 1561), which
          elicited a sharp rejoinder from Calvin. Strict Roman Catholics
          also disliked the work, and it was placed on the Lisbon Index in
          1581. At the emperor's request Cassander prepared a Consultatio
          de articulis inter Catholicos et Protestantes controversis,
          which he presented to Maximilian II. in 1564, Ferdinand having
          died in the mean time (published at Lyons, 1608; ed. H. Grotius,
          Amsterdam, 1642). To bring about a union Cassander starts with
          the "consensus" of the most ancient church, expressed in the
          Apostles' Creed. Though the Holy Scripture is to be
          authoritative, he wishes to maintain the importance of
          tradition, especially of the great Church Fathers (down to
          Gregory I.); only a difference which concerns the position to
          Christ himself, not "opiniones" or "ritus," may become a cause
          of division, but the bond of "caritas" is by no means to be
          violated. In the doctrine of original sin, the Lord's Supper,
          and justification, he tries to mediate. He is even inclined to
          give the cup to the laity, and he will also admit of the
          marriage of the clergy as a makeshift. In the other
          controversial questions (worship of saints, monasticism,
          indulgences, papal power) he tries to soften the difficulties
          and do away with exaggerations. A recantation before his death
          has been imputed to him. It is hard to save him for the Roman
          Catholics, however, and still less can he be claimed by the
          Protestant side. Seckendorf is correct when he says in the
          Commentarius (Frankfort and Leipsic, 1680, p. 347): "Georgius
          Cassander, a good theologian, to be sure not a Lutheran, but a
          lover of truth."

   Cassel, Conference of
          CASSEL, CONFERENCE OF: A religious colloquy at Cassel, July 1-9,
          1661, between certain Reformed theologians from the University
          of Marburg and Lutheran theologians front the University of
          Rinteln, arranged by Landgrave William VI. of Hesse. The aim was
          to bring about agreement or at least mutual toleration. They
          succeeded in finding some not unessential points, in the
          doctrines of the Lord's Supper, predestination, the person of
          Christ, and baptism, on which both parties agreed. It was
          resolved, moreover, not to revile one another in the future
          because of the differences still remaining, to free sermons from
          the burden of confessional polemics, and in any case no longer
          to attack an opponent personally. But this peaceful agreement
          did not meet with a kind reception in the rest of Germany.
          Frederick William, the Great Elector of Brandenburg, was, to be
          sure, an exception, and the Reformed party in France and Holland
          were inclined to come half-way; but the Lutherans rejected the
          arrangement absolutely. The union became the subject of lively
          literary combats, and the final result was a further
          intensification of confessional differences.

          b. at Gross-Glogau (55 m. n.w. of Breslau), Silesia, Feb. 27,
          1821; d. at Friedenau, a suburb of Berlin, Dec. 23, 1892. He was
          of Jewish parentage, studied history at Berlin, and from 1850 to
          1856 edited a newspaper at Erfurt. On May 28, 1855, he was
          baptized at Büssleben near Erfurt, and the next year became
          librarian of the Royal Library at Erfurt. In 1859 he settled at
          Berlin, where he acted as tutor and devoted himself to literary
          work. In 1866-67 he was a member of the Prussian Parliament,
          then he entered the service of the London Jewish Missionary
          Society and became its minister at the Christuskirche in Berlin.
          In 1891 he resigned his position and died shortly afterward.
          Cassel was a most prolific writer, and his article on the
          history of the Jews from the destruction of Jerusalem by Titus
          to the year 1847, written while still a Jew for Ersch and
          Gruber's Allgemeine Encyklopädie, sect. II., vol. xxvii., pp.
          1-238, Leipsic, 1850, is still valuable. By public lectures
          delivered in different cities of Germany, he tried to influence
          the educated Jews in favor of Christianity, and baptized many.
          He also combated anti-Semitism. Other works by him include the
          commentaries on Judges and Ruth in Lange's Commentary; also
          Weihnachten, Ursprünge, Bräuche und Aberglauben (Berlin, 1862);

          Santa Maria Maggiore, and three years later became titular
          archbishop of Nicomedia and grand almoner to Pope Leo XIII. As
          titular patriarch of Antioch he was nominated vicegerent of
          Rome, in which capacity he acted as the deputy of the cardinal
          vicar. He was created cardinal priest of Santi Vito, Modesto a

   Cassian
          CASSIAN: A martyr whose death is described by Prudentius in the
          ninth hymn of his Peristephanon. The poet says that he saw the
          martyr's grave at Forum Cornelii (Imola), with a picture of him,
          and that the custodian related that Cassian had been stabbed by
          his own pupils with their styli and otherwise cruelly handled.
          Gregory of Tours gives substantially the same account. The
          Martyrologium Hieronymianum names Aug. 11 as the day of his
          death. The fact of his martyrdom at Forum Cornelii need not be
          doubted, but the manner related by Prudentius is improbable, and
          it is impossible to fix the date.

          (A. Hauck.)

   Cassianus, Johannes
          CASSIANUS, cas´´sî-??´nUs, JOHANNES: Monk of the fifth century
          and the real founder of [790]Semi-Pelagianism; b. probably in
          Provence c. 360; d. at Marseilles c. 435. He received a thorough
          education, and then visited the East with an older friend named
          Germanus. At Bethlehem he entered a cloister, but the desire to
          know the famous Egyptian hermits led him and Germanus to Egypt,
          where they remained seven years, after which they revisited
          Bethlehem, but soon returned to Egypt. Thence Cassianus went to
          Constantinople, where he became the pupil of John Chrysostom,
          who ordained him deacon. The exile of Chrysostom in 403,
          however, obliged Cassianus and Germanus to take refuge with
          Innocent I. When Cassianus was ordained priest and returned home
          is unknown, and the fate of Germanus is equally uncertain. At
          Marseilles Cassianus founded two cloisters, one for monks and
          the other for nuns, and seems to have died shortly after
          completing his polemic against Nestorius.

          His earliest work, written before 426, was entitled De
          institutis coenobiorum et de octo principalium vitiorum remediis
          libri duodecim, and was composed at the request of Castor,
          bishop of Apta Julia, who wished to introduce the Oriental and
          especially the Egyptian rules into the monastery which he had
          founded. His second work was his Collationes viginti-quattuor,
          completed before 429. Both were widely spread throughout the
          Occident; Benedict of Nursia commanded that they be read to the
          monks in the refectory; Cassiodorus esteemed them highly,
          although he warned his monks against the heretical views of the
          author concerning the freedom of the will; and Gregory of Tours
          mentions them as used, together with other Oriental rules, in
          the monastery of St. Yririx. A brief compend was made by the
          friend of Cassianus, Eucherius, bishop of Lyons, which served as
          a source for the Concordia regularum of Benedict of Aniane.

          The thirteenth collation of Cassianus is important in the
          controversy on Augustine's doctrine of grace. Against his
          enemies, who were centered in Marseilles, the latter addressed,
          shortly before his death, his De prædestinatione sanctorum and
          De dono perseverantiæ, his chief opponent being Cassianus, who
          in this collation had enunciated the doctrine called
          Semi-Pelagianism in the Middle Ages, although it might more
          properly be termed Semi-Augustinianism, since Cassianus
          separated himself sharply from Pelagius and branded him as a
          heretic, while he felt himself in complete harmony with
          Augustine. His Greek training, however, rendered it impossible
          for him to accept Augustine's doctrine of unconditional
          predestination, particular grace, and the absolute denial of the
          freedom of the will. Casaianus, on the other hand, recognized
          the necessity of divine grace throughout the process of
          salvation, while postulating the existence of free will as a
          necessary condition for the operation of grace, and asserting
          that God never destroys the freedom of the will, even in such an
          extraordinary case as the conversion of Paul. He regarded it as
          a religious axiom, therefore, that salvation through Christ is
          not restricted to a small number of the elect, but is intended
          for all. This non-Augustinian concept of the process of
          salvation conditions Cassianus's view of original sin. He
          believed that the fall of Adam had brought destruction on the
          whole human race, although it still retained the power to seek
          goodness in virtue of its original state of immortality, wisdom,
          and complete freedom of the will. After the victory of a
          modified Augustinianism at the Synod of Orange in 529, the
          doctrines of Cassianus were generally regarded as heterodox,
          although this did not injure his fame as a monastic author, and
          in southern Gaul he was officially honored as a saint. See
          [791]Semi-Pelagianism.

          In the latter part of his life Cassianus became involved in the
          Nestorian controversy, and at the request of the archdeacon Leo
          (later Pope Leo I.) wrote his De incarnatione Domini contra
          Nestorium libri septem, the date being subsequent to the letters
          written by Nestorius to Pope Celestine in 430. The work lacks
          the importance which it would otherwise possess as the only
          extensive contribution of an Occidental to the Nestorian
          controversy, through its restriction to personal attacks on the
          opponent of its author and a complete omission of positive and
          independent Christological statements. Cassianus sought to prove
          that the divinity of Christ had existed from eternity and had
          never been renounced, so that Mary must be called not merely the
          mother of Christ, as Nestorius taught, but the mother of God.
          The work is especially valuable as showing the close sympathy of
          the interests and methods of Nestorianism and Pelagianism, while
          Cassianus, following the Gallic monk Leporius, who had renounced
          Pelagianism in 426, held that Christ possessed in a single
          person the two coexistent substances of God and man.

   Cassiodorus (Cassiodorius), Magnus Aurelius
          CASSIODORUS, cas´´si-o-dO´rus (CASSIODORIITS), MAGNUS AURELIUS:
          Roman historian, statesman, and monk; b. at Scylacium (the
          modern Squillace, on the gulf of the same name, 40 m. s.s.e. of
          Cosenza), Calabria, c. 480; d. in the monastery of Vivarium,
          near Scylacium, c. 570. Owing to the esteem in which his father
          was held by Theodoric, a public career was early open to him;
          and he pursued it until he had reached the highest dignities
          under the Ostrogothic monarchs. He stood in close personal
          relations with Theodoric, with whose efforts to bring about a
          fusion between the Germanic and Roman elements among his
          subjects he thoroughly sympathized. About 540 he retired from
          public life to the peace and quiet of the monastery founded by
          him on his own estates at Vivarium. Here he devoted himself to
          literary work, of which he had already made a beginning amidst
          his political activity, and pursued it zealously until his
          ninety-third year. He insisted on the duty of intellectual labor
          for his monks, helped their studies by every means in his power,
          of which his own example was not the least, and so contributed
          largely to the establishment of the tradition which made the
          monasteries, especially of the Benedictine order, the homes of
          learning throughout the dark ages.

          His literary work, like his life, falls into two periods. To the
          first belong a consular chronicle written in 519; twelve books
          of Gothic history, composed in the spirit of the policy of
          fusion already referred to, known to us only in the recast
          version of Jordanes, De origine actibusque Getarum (the work of
          Cassiodorus seems to have borne the same title); panegyrics on
          the kings and queens of the Goths, of which only dubious
          fragments remain; a collection (made about 538) of rescripts
          composed by him during his long and varied official life, and
          formulas of appointment to a great variety of offices, in twelve
          books, under the title Variæ; a small philosophical work, De
          anima, written immediately after the completion of the Variæ, at
          the request of friends, whose questions about the soul he
          answers, following Claudianus Mamertus and Augustine. The
          last-named work forms a sort of transition to those of the
          second period. The most important of these, composed probably in
          544, is the Institutiones divinarum et sæcularium litterarum (or
          better lectionum). The first book is devoted to spiritual
          learning, the second to secular; and both together form the
          first part of a complete course of instruction designed by
          Cassiodorus for the Western clergy, and especially for his own
          monks. The first book is only an introduction to the study of
          theology, explaining the most important preliminary knowledge
          required and the literary helps at the student's command for his
          further education; the second gives brief compendiums of various
          branches of secular learning. To this the last work of
          Cassiodorus, De orthographia, forms a supplement. Another
          voluminous theological work, begun before the Institutiones but
          finished long after, was a full explanation of the Psalms in
          their threefold aspect, spiritual, historical, and symbolic. He
          wrote other exegetical works, of which his Complexiones in
          epistolas et acta apostolorum et apocalypsin is still extant. Of
          much greater value to posterity is his Historia ecclesiastica
          tripartita in twelve books, composed of extracts from the Greek
          historians Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, whose works he had
          translated by Epiphanius. It is in no sense an original work,
          and is put together in a patchwork fashion; but it filled up a
          great gap in the general Western knowledge of church history,
          and, incomplete as it is, was the principal handbook used in the
          Middle Ages for its period.

          (10 m. s.s.e. of Bedford), Bedfordshire, 1685. He studied at
          Emmanuel and St. John's colleges, Cambridge (B.A., 1625; M.A.,
          1628; B.D., 1635; D.D., 1661). He assisted Walton on his
          Polyglot (1657), contributing the editions of the Samaritan,
          Syriac, Arabic, and Ethiopic versions, and other
          (unacknowledged) portions, and also spent freely of his own
          fortune for the work. In 1669 he brought out in two volumes,
          folio, at London, his Lexicon Heptaglotton, Hebraicum,
          Chaldaicum, Syriacum, Samaritanum, Æthiopicum, Arabicum,
          conjunctim; et Persicum separatim, specially prepared to
          supplement the Polyglot. This work was the result of eighteen
          years of the most unremitting labor, cost the author £12,000,
          and left him ruined in fortune and health. His work was
          enthusiastically received on the Continent, but neglected in
          England. Late in life he received some favor from the king, was
          appointed chaplain in ordinary in 1666, prebendary of Canterbury
          and professor of Arabic at Cambridge 1667, and was successively
          vicar of Hatfield Peverell, Essex; rector of Wodeham Walter,
          Essex; and rector of Higham Gobion.

          Reformer; b. at Saint-Martin du Fresne (30 m. w. of Geneva)
          1515; d. at Basel Dec. 29, 1563. He pursued his studies under
          difficult circumstances until he became tutor to three young
          noblemen. In 1540 he went to Strasburg, lived in Calvin's house,
          and accompanied him to Geneva, where on Calvin's recommendation
          he became rector of the high school. But disagreement soon arose
          between him and the great Reformer, Castellio holding views of
          his own concerning election and Christ's descent into hell, and
          regarding the Song of Solomon as an erotic poem which should be
          excluded from the canon. He left Geneva in 1544 and settled in
          Basel, where he lived in great poverty till 1552, when he was
          appointed professor of Greek literature. His first publication
          was Dialogi sacri (Geneva, 1543; Eng. transl., The History of
          the Bible, collected into 119 dialogues, London, 1715; again
          under the title, Youth's Scripture Remembrancer, 1743), much
          used as a school-book. In 1551 he published in Basel his chief
          work, an elegant annotated Latin translation of the Bible, which
          he dedicated to Edward VI. of England (12th ed., Leipsic, 1778).
          The notes gave offense, as they betrayed skepticism as to the
          attainability of religious truth, and the dedication, a noble
          plea for religious toleration, was unacceptable to the age. In
          1555 he published at Basel a complete French translation of the
          Bible, with a dedication to Henry II. of France. He was
          violently attacked by Calvin and Beza because of his criticism
          of their conduct in burning Servetus, but defended himself
          vigorously in his De hæreticis (Basel, 1554); and in Contra
          libellum Calvini, in quo ostendere conatur hæreticos jure gladii
          coercendos esse. Calvin's influence suppressed the latter, and
          it was not published till 1612.

   Casuistry
          CASUISTRY: The name of a special form of discipline, or branch
          of ethics, constituting a somewhat elaborated scheme of doctrine
          concerning proper moral action in single and concrete instances.
          The evaluation of this kind of activity evolves itself generally
          as consequence of a lawful and rightful apprehension of the
          moral walk, whereby we accentuate external conduct according to
          definite prescriptive rules. Coordinately with a fundamental
          moral cede for this action, certain ethical norms with legal
          adjuncts were in practical operation so far back as the Jewish
          "scribes and Pharisees."

    Teaching of Jesus and Paul.

          Jesus came forward in sharpest contrast with this casuistical
          doctrine of morals. As he suffered his disciples to become
          derivately participant of his integral community with God, he
          kindled in them a love to God, which was to verify itself in
          love to men. To this love he brought back the conception of the
          Law fulfilled; and accordingly he teaches in the place of
          casuistry a direction of life spontaneously individual. Even
          where he appears himself to set up casuistical requirements
          (Matt. v. 21 sqq., vi. 1 sqq., xxii. 17 sqq.; Luke xiv. 3 sqq.)
          it is always expressly in order to lay emphasis upon the
          spiritual interpretation of the Law, over against legalizing
          constructiveness. These thoughts were but dialectically expanded
          through Paul's epistles, inasmuch as he teaches that faith in
          God's grace in Christ has its operation in the love which
          fulfils the requirements of God's will in agreement with the
          spirit of the Law. Yet he knew that even though faith and love
          be present, still the certainty is not immediately vouchsafed as
          to what is right in this or that particular instance (Rom. xii.
          2; Phil. i. 9, 10). He, therefore, dwells on a persistently
          proving examination of God's will, and gives corresponding
          instructions to his own congregations; which instructions now
          and then through their touching upon particular conditions have
          a certain casuistic stamp about them (cf. I Cor. vii. 8, 10);
          but, in distinction from every form of casuistic legalism by
          means of morally postulated direction, they seek to develop the
          proper moral consciousness of the congregations themselves.

    Development of Casuistry.

          But even early in the postapostolic age, the tendency set in,
          coordinately with a one-sided intellectualizing conception of
          the faith, to regulate by outward legalism the moral life as
          thus robbed of its religious mainspring; and the same tendency
          involved the casuistical treatment of ethics. Still further was
          this disposition fostered in Western theology through the
          influence of Stoicism, and in part through the legalizing
          development of ecclesiastical doctrine. It shows itself even in
          Augustine, despite his obliteration of ethics, and continued to
          be characteristic of the entire Western Catholic ethical system.
          What ministered still more widely to the development of
          casuistry was the very early and momentously elaborated
          ecclesiastical institution of penance, with the infliction of
          ecclesiastical penalties for individual sins. The appertaining
          customary rules of the ancient forms of procedure and the
          relevantly codified decrees of separate synods were brought
          together, supplemented, and arranged by the compilers. There
          thus arose the definite manuals on penance for the use of
          confessors; among which the best known were those attributed to
          Archbishop Theodore of Canterbury (d. 690) and the Venerable
          Bede (d. 735). A still greater amplification of casuistry was
          promoted by the entire method of the scholastic ethics, with its
          subtle disputations; by the influence of the canonical
          repetition; and by the universally obligatory institution of
          auricular confession (1215). Under such influences there arose a
          distinctive systematic discipline, which in contradistinction to
          the philosophic and legal came to be designated as theological
          casuistry. The scholars who cultivated the same constituted,
          under the name of casuists or schemists, both in the Middle Ages
          and at Roman Catholic universities much later still, a special
          class of teachers, notably so as against the canonists. The
          writings which embodied this discipline were the so-called
          "summæ of cases of conscience " (summæ casuum conscientiæ). Of
          these the most ancient was compiled in the thirteenth century by
          Raymond of Peñaforte (printed at Lyons, 1719). There then
          followed a good many such writings while scholasticism was
          approaching the term of its decay through the fourteenth and
          fifteenth centuries. The most renowned of these summæ, which are
          usually designated in brief by the author's name or birthplace,
          are the following: the Astesana (printed 1468, and often);
          Pisanella (written 1338; printed, Paris, 1470); Pacifica
          (written c. 1470; printed, Venice, 1576); Rosella; Angelica; and
          lastly the one usually known as summa summarum; properly the
          compilation merely of Sylvester Prierias, which dates from the
          beginning of the Reformation period.

    Casuistry in Protestantism.

          As the Reformers revived the Pauline idea of a free motive power
          in faith, casuistry proper was fundamentally set aside, and they
          even occasionally declared themselves expressly opposed to it
          (Calvin, "Institutes," IV. x. 1 sqq.; Luther, Resol. i. concl.
          Ecc., ii.). Existing conditions nevertheless gave rise to a
          certain evangelical counterpart to the Roman Catholic casuistry.
          The Reformatory movement introduced a multitude of new problems
          in morality. So in difficult contingencies people frequently
          appealed for enlightenment to the Reformers and other persons of
          esteem, or in turn to the theological faculties. In this way the
          collected letters of Luther and Calvin, as well as Melanchthon's
          counsels (Berathschlagungen, etc., issued by Petzel, 1601), have
          furnished copious illustrations at large in the matter of
          evangelical resolutions of conscience. The systematic
          collections of faculty decisions (Thesaurus consiliorum, etc.,
          by Dedekenn; Gerhard's In richtigerer Ordnung, 1676) even early
          denote the transition to a distinctive evangelical casuistry.
          The more legalizing spirit of the post-Reformation era became
          thus practically effective. Even here, however, the various
          particular moral transactions were not viewed, in their
          development, as in the Roman Catholic casuistry, but as fruits
          of faith, of knowledge in part, and of the life according to the
          spirit of Christ. The Reformed theology took precedence in the
          elaboration of casuistry. The first treatise of this kind is
          that of the Cambridge professor William Perkins (d. 1602; see
          [795]Perkins, William), A Case of Conscience (originally in
          English; Latin by Meyer, 1603), of a strict Puritan tone. A
          similar book of kindred thought was written by his pupil the
          Scotchman William Ames (De conscientia, Amsterdam, 1630).
          Somewhat prior to this, the German theologian Alstedt had
          published a work on casuistry (Theologia casuum, Hanover, 1621).
          But although he represented casuistry as a singularly important
          science, there were in the Reformed Church only a few English
          theologians that still espoused casuistry. The first Lutheran
          work on casuistry grew out of lectures delivered by Professor
          Baldwin at Wittenberg in opposition to the Roman Catholic
          casuistry, and with the design of systematically setting forth
          the import of the faculty's opinions. His manuscript was
          published after his death by the Wittenberg Theological Faculty
          (Tractatus de casibus conscientæ, Frankfort, 1659). Of the
          remaining Lutheran writings of this nature; there should still
          be noted the works of Dannhauer (1679), Bechmann (1692), and
          Johannes Olearius (1699). Pietism, although Spener's views on
          moral questions (Theologische Bedenken, 1700; Letzte
          theologische Bedenken, 1711) have a casuistical tone, still
          contributed not a little to the shelving of casuistry, in that
          it deepened the understanding with reference to the
          interdependency of the Christian's total transactions with his
          religious-moral basic intuitions. After Buddeus in his moral
          theology had shown casuistry to be superfluous, only isolated
          works on the subject appeared in the Lutheran Church.

          In the Roman Catholic Church, on the contrary, the ethics of the
          Jesuits came to be out and out casuistical. And even apart from
          them, in that quarter, casuistry was cultivated (cf. P.
          Lambertini, Casus conscientiæ, Augsburg, 1763; S. Sobiech,
          Compendium theologiæ moralis, Breslau, 1822).

   Casus Reservati ('Reserved Cases')
          CASUS RESERVATI ("Reserved Cases"): In the Roman Catholic
          Church, cases in which absolution can be given only by a priest
          specially authorized. The practise of such reservation is
          defended on the ground that Christ granted the power of
          absolution only to the apostles and their successors (John xx.
          21-23), and that the pope and bishops have thus the right to
          reserve to themselves as much of this power as in their judgment
          the good of the Church requires. This view is formally
          sanctioned by the Council of Trent (Sess. XIV., cap. vii., de
          poenitentia, 11). The cases in question are "certain graver
          cases of offense," "certain more atrocious and graver
          offenses"--grave external sins, definitely completed and
          specifically determined by the legislator, i.e., by the pope or
          bishop. The details were gradually fixed in practise. Ordinarily
          speaking, the popes reserved to themselves only sins for which
          excommunication was the penalty, from which only the apostolic
          see could release the culprit, though there are some to which
          this did not apply. The principal instances are these named in
          the bull [796]In coena Domini . Where, in these cases, the sin
          is not matter of public knowledge, the bishops are allowed to
          absolve (in person or by deputy) in foro conscientiæ; and other
          cases reserved to the pope are placed in their jurisdiction by
          their quinquennial faculties (see [797]Faculties). The
          constitution Apostolicæ sedis of Pius IX. (1869) gives precise
          details on the different classes of reserved cases at the
          present day. The cases reserved to the bishops vary according to
          the locality; in general, they include a number of the graver
          sins, certain forms of unchastity, homicide, breach of the seal
          of confession by priests, etc. Bishops commonly depute their
          powers over a number of these cases to subordinates, either
          permanently or for special seasons. In all kinds of reserved
          cases, however, a penitent may be absolved by any priest in case
          of urgent necessity, such as approaching death.

   Caswall, Edward
          CASWALL, EDWARD: Hymn writer; b. at Yateley (35 m. w.s.w. of
          London), Hampshire, July 15, 1814; d. at the Oratory, Edgbaston,
          near Birmingham, Jan. 2, 1878. He studied at Brasenose College,
          Oxford (B.A., 1836; M.A., 1838); was curate of
          Stratford-sub-Castle, near Salisbury, 1840-47; in 1850 he joined
          the Oratory of St. Philip Neri under Newman, to whose influence
          his conversion to Roman Catholicism was due. He wrote original
          poems, but is best known for his translations from the Roman
          breviary and other Latin sources, which are marked by
          faithfulness to the original and purity of rhythm. They were
          published in Lyra Catholica, containing all the breviary and
          missal hymns (London, 1849); The Masque of Mary (1858); and A
          May Pageant (1865). Hymns and Prose (1873) is the three books
          combined with many of the hymns rewritten or revised.

   Catafalque
          CATAFALQUE: A structure erected to represent a corpse lying in
          state, decorated with emblems of mourning (also called tumba,
          castrum doloris). The custom of erecting such structures arose
          in the Catholic Church when the corpse of the deceased was no
          longer brought into the church, where, according to the Roman
          rite, the office of the dead, the requiem-mass, and the Libera
          were to be sung, before the interment. The object of the
          catafalque was to keep the older custom in mind, and to add
          greater solemnity to the service. The bier is covered with black
          hangings, and surrounded with lights. The officiating priest
          sprinkles it with holy water, as a symbol of the purifying blood
          of Christ and the water of eternal life, and then censes it as a
          token of honor to the body of the deceased, which has been the
          temple of the Holy Ghost, and as a symbol of the prayers for the
          departed soul which are to go up as a sweet savor before the
          Lord.

   Cataldus
          CA-TAL´DUS: According to legend, a native of Ireland and bishop
          there of a place called Rachan, otherwise unknown. He is said to
          have made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem and to have been directed in
          a vision to preach the Gospel to the heathen at Tarentum. With
          signs and wonders he performed his mission, became bishop of
          Tarentum or even archbishop, and converted the entire region
          before his death. The historical fact which underlies the legend
          is probably that a pious Irishman named Cataldus or Cathaldus (
          = Cathal or Cathald, a real Irish name) preached in Lower Italy.
          His time can not be earlier than the sixth or seventh century.
          The veneration of Cataldus begins in the early Middle Ages. His
          relics were discovered in 1071, and many churches are dedicated
          to him in Lower Italy, and also in France, where he is honored
          as St. Carthauld or St. Catas. He is commemorated on Mar. 8, May
          8, and May 10, the last being the day of his death according to
          the Martyrologium Romanum.

    1. Origin and Signification of the Terms.

          The education which the Christian Church imparts to its immature
          members through its chosen servants, and the theory of this
          education, is called catechesis. The Greek word katechein means
          literally "to sound downward." Hippocrates, connecting it with
          the accusative of the person, signified by it the oral
          instruction which the physician imparts to the layman concerning
          the nature and treatment of disease. Lucian applied the word in
          a similar sense to the relation of the dramatic poet to his
          audience. Thus it gradually came to denote the making of an oral
          communication to another (Acts xxi. 21, 24), or the instruction
          of another. It is used in the sense of religious instruction in
          Luke i. 4; Acts xviii. 25; Rom. ii. 18; I Cor. xiv. 19; Gal. vi.
          6. In ecclesiastical usage it signified preparation of adults
          for baptism (see [801]Catechumenate). Here instruction was the
          principal, but not the only factor; heart, will, and conduct
          were to be influenced. The word catechesis, therefore, properly
          covers the whole training given by the Church to its children.
          It is distinguished from Christian pedagogics in that it
          furnishes only an elementary knowledge of Christian truth, while
          pedagogics leads to a detailed and scientific knowledge.

          In the ancient Church ecclesiastical education began as soon as
          a heathen announced his willingness to be received into the
          Church. He was then accepted among the catechumens and bore the
          name of Christian. Nowadays Christian education is concerned no
          longer primarily with the heathen, but with the children of
          Christians. They are baptized in infancy, on condition that
          their parents promise to give them a Christian education.
          Moreover, the baptized, when they come to years of discretion,
          must evince a desire for the blessings of the Church, and give
          promise of Christian conduct.

    2. Divergent Views of the Object of Catechesis.

          It is more difficult to define the aim of ecclesiastical
          education. This can not be intellectual only; for catechesis is
          to lead to Christian feeling, to a Christian formation of will
          and conduct. Nor is it merely to inculcate obedience to the
          teachings and commandments of the Church; for catechesis is
          intended to lead to personal conviction. Others have considered
          qualification for the Lord's Supper as its aim, but this
          definition begs the question; for who is really qualified for
          the Lord's Supper? Others regard living faith as the aim of
          Christian education; but children of Christian parents can not
          be regarded as unbelievers. They come from Christian
          surroundings and possess already a certain unconscious faith in
          God and the Savior; ecclesiastical education is rather to
          confirm this implicit faith and develop it into Christian
          conviction and conduct. Thus faith is the presupposition of
          ecclesiastical education, but not its aim. As to what this
          really is, Scripture does not give a definite answer; the
          distinction, however, between immature and mature Christians (I
          Cor. iii. 1; Eph. iv. 13; Heb. v. 12) brings nearer to a
          solution of the problem. There is a childlike faith in the Lord
          which is still ignorant and without a firm hold, and there is a
          faith of the adult who has attained a convinced knowledge of
          Christian truth and a certain perfection in Christian conduct.

    3. True Aim of Catechesis.

          Whoever of his own will and upon the basis of his faith seeks
          communion with Christ in the means of grace and in prayer is
          mature, and ecclesiastical education exists for the purpose of
          attaining that maturity. It is evident that no definite age can
          be laid down for such an attainment, because faith and Christian
          conduct are based upon moral freedom. Maturity depends
          altogether upon the individual, and can not be armed of any one
          because the heart can not be read. On that account every person
          must be considered mature who possesses a sufficient knowledge
          of Christian truth and who promises to lead a Christian life.
          Maturity is, therefore, more than a qualification for the
          reception of the Lord's Supper; a child of ten years may have
          the faith and knowledge necessary for receiving the sacrament in
          a becoming manner, but he is not mature. Ecclesiastical
          education must be continued after the first communion. This
          further growth may be gradually attained by the continuation of
          Christian fellowship in the family and in the Church; but since
          this, under the conditions of modern life, is not always
          applicable, theologians usually lay down the necessity of
          special institutions whose educational work shall continue until
          the attainment of maturity.

    4. Methods of Catechesis.

          Instruction is the principal although not the only means of
          education. Religious instruction is first and foremost
          instruction of the heart, intended to lead to a knowledge of
          God. But this knowledge is based upon inner experiences, and
          these experiences again have their foundation in observation.
          God has revealed himself in nature, but more completely in the
          spiritual life. This, as manifested in Christ, is the perfect
          revelation of God; and as the record of this life is found in
          Holy Scripture, the Bible is the principal book of instruction.
          Owing to the wealth of material contained therein, it has been
          considered advisable to condense and select certain stories
          specially adapted for the young without paying particular
          attention to their connection as a whole. From this book of
          stories the pupil is gradually led to the Bible itself. He is to
          memorize certain passages and read different portions of it in
          order to penetrate its spirit and attain practise in its use.
          The Gospels, some historical sections of the Old Testament, and
          the Psalms are best adapted for this purpose. Another source of
          material for religious instruction is found in the Church hymns,
          which awaken religious sentiment and enable the pupil to
          participate intelligently in public worship. After the pupil has
          acquired a number of religious truths from the selections or
          from the Bible itself, it is possible to present these truths in
          their most concise form and in their connection. This is
          necessary in order to give the pupil a clear survey of the
          Christian truths and to strengthen his conviction. Such an
          epitome is given in the catechism. The part of it longest in use
          is the Apostles' Creed; next followed the Lord's Prayer, and in
          the Middle Ages the decalogue was added as a basis of
          instruction, to give a proper understanding of sin. These three
          articles form the main portions of the Evangelical catechism;
          from the law the pupil learns the greatness of his sin, in the
          creed he professes his faith in the means of salvation from it,
          and in the Lord's Prayer he expresses his longing for Christian
          conduct as a disciple of Christ. Since the immediate aim of
          religious instruction is, participation in the Lord's Supper,
          the doctrine of the sacrament forms the fourth division of the
          Catechism. This is the order of the Reformation catechisms; and
          though objections have been made to it, they may be shown to be
          unfounded.

          As the catechist has not only to communicate knowledge, but to
          move the heart and will, the instruction must be oral and
          personal. No book ought to be used in religious instruction,
          except the Bible at the time fixed for reading it. Biblical
          stories, hymn-books, and catechisms are only aids to be used at
          home. As children like to hear stories, the teacher should begin
          his instruction with telling them. Verses of hymns, texts and
          answers from the catechism are to be used mainly in illustration
          of the Biblical story. As the child's attention is attracted
          only a short time by the talk of the teacher, his interest has
          to be retained by asking him questions. There is a distinction
          made between analytical and synthetical instruction. In
          analytical instruction the material is ready at hand, as in the
          Biblical story, in Scripture-reading, and hymns, and the
          religious truth is developed from it. In synthetical instruction
          only the theme is given, as in the catechism and Bible texts,
          and the material has to be gathered elsewhere.

          Owing to the amount of material, religious instruction must be
          spread over several years. In the German system it covers eight,
          during the first four of which the Bible story forms the basis
          of instruction. In the fifth year hymns are treated in
          connection with the church year, and Bible-reading and
          instruction, in the catechism are begun. The pupils receive
          practise in the use of the Bible, and some portions of the
          historical books are read in connection with the Biblical
          stories. The decalogue, the creed, and the Lord's Prayer are
          briefly explained and thus stamped upon the memory. The last two
          years place Bible-reading and the catechism in the foreground.
          The instruction should be imparted by both pastor and teacher.
          It is advisable that the pastor should instruct the pupils at
          least two years; he should confine himself mainly to the
          catechism in connection with Bible-reading, and leave the
          Biblical stories and hymns to the teacher. On any arrangement it
          is essential that pastor and teacher should work in harmony,
          each with an eye to the special instruction imparted by the
          other.

    5. Practical Application of Catechesis.

          As religious education addresses itself to the heart as well as
          to the mind, the cultivation of the former is not less the duty
          of the catechist. Common devotional exercises are held,
          consisting of the singing of hymns, reading of Scripture, and an
          extempore prayer by the teacher. Moreover, observance of Sunday
          and regular attendance on the Church services should be required
          of the children. As the sermons at those services can not be
          sufficiently grasped by younger children, special services are
          to be arranged for them. With the religious practise moral
          practise must go hand in hand. Order, diligence, modesty,
          obedience, truth, and other virtues must be inculcated.

          While the pupil must be taught obedience and respect, the
          teacher should not be immoderate and unjust in his demands or
          irascible. If he shows the least partiality or injustice, he
          weakens his authority. Reproof should come before punishment,
          and should be made to suffice as long as possible, so that the
          teacher shall not come too soon to the end of his resources.
          Older scholars should be won by private exhortation where
          necessary, and led to self-examination and self-judgment, so
          that they may find the path of goodness for themselves.

    6. Relation of Catechesis to Confirmation.

          Christianity as a spiritual religion demands a definite
          religious conviction and moral sentiment. The Christian Church,
          therefore, receives as members only those who make their
          confession of faith and promise Christian conduct. In the early
          Church a profession of faith and a vow were made before baptism,
          and the first communion followed after it. When infant baptism
          became general, the need was felt of bringing in this profession
          and vow later as a preliminary to the first communion. In this
          way originated the rite of [802]confirmation in the Protestant
          churches. Confirmation is not a declaration of maturity. The
          faith of a child may be of such a kind as to admit him or her to
          the Lord's Supper, but not yet to a life that may dispense with
          all further religious aid. The profession and the vow must be
          spontaneous, they must proceed from the candidate's own moral
          decision; therefore, the child should not be forced to
          confirmation at a fixed age. The custom of confirming children
          as a matter of course at the age of fourteen has led to
          insincerity and hypocrisy, and it is the duty of the Church to
          check it as much as possible, which can to a certain extent be
          accomplished by emphasizing the purely voluntary character of
          the act, and by having an intervening time between the
          examination in religious knowledge and the profession of faith.

          If the confirmed are still immature in the religious sense,
          their education must be continued. The influence of the
          Christian home and of church fellowship are hardly sufficient
          for this. Our ancestors in both the Lutheran and the Reformed
          churches demanded that the children should continue to
          participate, even after their first communion, in the regular
          catechetical instruction of the Church until their eighteenth
          year or until their marriage. These customs have disappeared in
          the last century because confirmed children have been considered
          mature, but this is a grave mistake, in view of the diminution
          of wholesome family influence and the observance of Sunday, and
          the reform of these conditions is an urgent necessity of our
          modern Church.

          (E. Sachsse.)

          The preceding article is written from the standpoint of a
          subject of Germany, where Church and State are united and
          religious instruction is consequently a part of the curriculum
          of the schools. A treatment of catechetics from a more general
          point of view is given by implication in [803]Catechisms.

          Catechisms are written or printed summaries of the principal
          doctrines of the Christian faith, intended for the instruction
          of the unlearned and the young. These formal aids to systematic
          instruction are of comparatively modern growth. For the system
          of the primitive Church, See [806]Catechumenate.

  I. The Middle Ages:

    1. Need of Catechetical Instruction.

          The beginnings of modern catechetical instruction, as to the
          development of which see [807]Catechesis, Catechetics, are found
          principally in the Germanic Churches. Here, as in primitive days
          and for the same reason, it originally addressed itself chiefly
          to adults. Sometimes whole tribes had been converted to
          Christianity in which the individuals did not possess the most
          elementary knowledge of the Christian faith, and it was
          necessary to impart by further teaching what had been neglected
          at the time of baptism. The Anglo-Saxon Church, and afterward
          Charlemagne, under the influence of his Anglo-Saxon adviser
          Alcuin, decreed that every baptized person should know by heart
          the Creed and the Lord's Prayer. But the rising generation was
          not left altogether out of view. There was from the beginning an
          indefinite feeling among the Teutonic Churches that the Church,
          by its acceptance of infant baptism, was bound to care for the
          instruction of the children thus brought into its fold. It was
          naturally impossible, in view of the widely scattered parishes
          and the necessity of instruction being almost exclusively oral,
          to undertake the actual teaching; but the need was to some
          extent indirectly met by the requirement that no sponsor should
          present a child for baptism without being able to recite the
          Creed and the Lord's Prayer, and that sponsors should teach the
          same articles to their godchildren.

    2. Influence of Confession.

          Another influence that helped to enforce a certain amount of
          Christian knowledge was the system of regular confession,
          especially after an annual confession was made obligatory by the
          Fourth Lateran Council of 1215. With the act of confession was
          usually connected a recitation of the articles which the
          sponsors were supposed to have impressed upon their godchildren.
          The system further led to an enlargement of the scope of regular
          instruction. As the Creed and the Lord's Prayer hardly formed a
          suitable basis for the confession of sins, there originated
          lists of the sins which required ecclesiastical penance; and
          these, with corresponding lists of virtues, were often ordered
          to be learned by heart; in this connection the decalogue was
          redeemed from oblivion. It became a regular practise to preach
          sermons on the Ten Commandments in Lent, the most usual time for
          confession; and thus catechetical preaching developed. The
          reformers of the fourteenth and fifteenth centuries, such as
          Gerson and Geiler von Kaisersberg, were strong advocates of
          these sermons on the foundations of Christian doctrine. The Ave
          Maria was included among the articles to be learned, and came to
          take equal rank with the Creed and the Lord's Prayer. The
          tendency was to enlarge the material, though some attempts were
          made, on the other hand, to condense it; thus Johann Wolf of
          Frankfort showed that all the articles used in confession could
          be traced to the decalogue. He also laid special emphasis upon
          the religious instruction of youth in a period when the councils
          of the Church paid no particular attention to it as a distinct
          branch of church work.

    3. Pre-Reformation Catechisms.

          The beginning of a reformation in this respect was the work of
          humanists like Jakob Wimpheling and Erasmus. Colet in England
          drew up a manual of religious instruction under the title of
          Catechyzon for the boys of St. Paul's School, which Erasmus put
          into Latin hexameters, thereby perhaps giving the impulse to
          Petrus Tritonius to produce a similar work. Outside, however, of
          such efforts, which were rather scholastic than ecclesiastical,
          catechisms in the modern sense, or compilations of the principal
          articles of faith for children, were practically unknown to the
          medieval Church.

          There were, indeed, such compilations for the clergy, which with
          the invention of printing began to circulate widely among the
          laity. The Tafel des christlichen Lebens (c. 1480) is in more
          ways than one a direct predecessor of Luther's smaller
          catechism, but a comparison shows the characteristic difference
          between the medieval and the Evangelical Church. In the Catholic
          table are found numerous pieces without any explanatory word,
          sacred formulas that were frequently repeated without
          comprehension; in Luther's catechism appear the five main
          articles, with the emphasis laid upon the explanation. Great
          importance was attached to the religious instruction of youth by
          the Bohemian Brethren and the Waldenses. The Interrogacions
          menors of the Waldenses date from the end of the fifteenth, or
          at least from the beginning of the sixteenth, century. The
          Kinderfragen of the Bohemian Brethren are still older, since
          they served as a model for the Interrogacions.

  II. The Post-Reformation Period:

          From the beginning of the Reformation care was taken to provide
          for the religious instruction of youth. Almost simultaneously
          the two places where the movement had its origin established
          institutions which were followed as models; in 1521 Johann
          Agricola was appointed catechist at Wittenberg, and in 1522
          systematic instruction of youth in the Christian faith was
          established in Zurich in place of the Roman confirmation.

    1. Early Lutheran Catechisms.

          Luther's popular expositions of the Ten Commandments, the Creed,
          and the Lord's Prayer, especially his Kurze Form and his
          Betbüchlein, are not catechisms in the proper sense of the word,
          but rather prepared the way for them. Several adaptations of the
          Kinderfragen of the Bohemian Brethren, German translations of
          Melanchthon's Enchiridion and Scholia, and numerous other
          compilations of the Christian truth adapted for children show
          the demand for an Evangelical text-book. Toward the end of 1524
          Justus Jonas and Agricola were ordered to write such a book;
          they did not execute their commission, but toward the end of
          1525 there was published the Büchlein für die Laien und Kinder
          (possibly by Bugenhagen), which provisionally at least supplied
          the want. About the same time Luther urged, in his Deutsche
          Messe, the introduction of religious instruction for children.
          His appeal called forth numerous expositions of the articles of
          faith, and in many places systematic teaching was begun. In 1529
          Luther published his Smaller Catechism (sometimes known as
          Enchiridion), and with it the material of the catechism was
          firmly established for the future (see [808]Luther's Two
          Catechisms). In some places, especially under the influence of
          the Nuremberg Kinderpredigten (1533), the power of the keys was
          added as a sixth article, and is still used as such in some of
          the churches of Germany.

    2. Gradual Supremacy of Luther's Smaller Catechism.

          At first Luther's catechism was merely one among several others,
          though it was almost universally adopted in both parts of
          Saxony, in Brandenburg, and in Pomerania. Apart from manuals
          produced under the influence of the Swiss theology, like those
          of Leo Jud and Bullinger, there are others which follow Luther's
          doctrine, among them Kaspar Löwer's Unterricht des Glaubens
          (1529), Johann Brenz's Fragestücke (1535), which is still used
          in Württemberg, Butzer's catechisms for Strasburg (1534 and
          1537), and others. It was only by degrees that Luther's work
          assumed the supremacy over other catechisms of the same
          tendency, until it finally attained the importance of a standard
          of doctrine. It was treated as such for the first time in 1561
          in the articles of Lüneburg, where it had its place beside the
          Augsburg Confession, the Apology, and the Schmalkald Articles
          (see [809]Corpus Docrinæ). It attained a still stronger position
          in contradistinction to the [810]Heidelberg Catechism. The
          latter, which from the first was considered in the light of a
          confession of faith, was compiled in 1563 by Olevianus and
          Ursinus from the catechisms of Leo Jud and Bullinger, from the
          Emden catechism of 1554, from Calvin's catechism of 1542 (see
          below), and from two catechisms used among Low-German emigrant
          churches of the sixteenth century, and was soon introduced in
          all countries where the Reformed faith prevailed. In 1580 the
          Smaller Catechism was included in the Book of Concord, and took
          rank everywhere as the corresponding standard of Lutheran
          doctrine. While the Heidelberg Catechism, as the more
          comprehensive work, retained everywhere its old form, Luther's
          Enchiridion formed frequently only the basis for fuller
          expositions, in connection, e.g., with Brenz's Fragestücke of
          1535 and a booklet printed in 1549 at Erfurt under Luther's
          name, though really compiled by Johann Lang, entitled
          Fragestücke fur die, so zum Sacrament gehen wöllen.

    3. Early Catechisms Based on Luther's Work.

          No little influence on the development of a traditional form for
          catechisms was exercised by the Latin ones prepared for the
          Latin schools. The material of these, based partly upon the Loci
          of Melanchthon, grew to such an extent that they almost formed
          regular dogmatic works. Among the catechisms which originated
          from such sources on the basis of Luther's Encheiridion the
          Kleiner Catechismus D. M. Lutheri, by Nicolaus Herco (1554)
          shows a fairly definite form already assumed by the development.
          A wider circulation was attained by the Fragestücke of
          Bartholomæus Rosinus (1580). The first regular catechism with
          expositions was the Goldene Kleinod of Johann Tetelbach (1568);
          and the first of such to receive official sanction was the
          Nuremberg Kinderlehrbüchlein. (1628).

    4. Orthodox and Pietistic Catechisms.

          During this whole period catechetical instruction consisted of
          nothing more than the memorizing by the children of the
          catechisms. Further explanations were left to the catechetical
          sermons which gradually became more common, modeled after
          Luther's Larger Catechism and the Nuremberg Kinderpredigten of
          1533. Frequently it was decided that the children should be
          questioned on these sermons. On the other hand, efforts were
          early made to guard children against a mechanical memorizing by
          making the text intelligible to them. A school edition of the
          Heidelberg Catechism (1610) gives four rules in this respect;
          (1) difficult passages are to be explained; (2) a long paragraph
          is to be condensed by the pupil; (3) the text of the catechism
          is to be analyzed by the teacher, putting questions which the
          children have to answer from the text; (4) the catechism is to
          be confirmed and proved by Bible texts and stories. The method
          laid down in these rules dominated catechetical instruction
          until a late time in the eighteenth century. Orthodox and
          pietistic catechists agreed in the use of the analytical method;
          but the latter emphasized more strongly the cultivation of the
          heart, and in formulating the questions and answers of the
          catechism laid stress upon the practical side of life, as may be
          seen from Philipp Jakob Spener's Tabulæ catecheticæ (Frankfort,
          1683). The two principal pietistic catechisms are Spener's
          Erklärung der christlichen Lehre (1677) and the Dresden
          Kreuz-Katechismus (1688). But even Pietism could not hinder the
          gradual degeneration of catechetical instruction into mere
          formalism.

    5. Rationalistic Catechisms of the Eighteenth Century.

          A fresh impulse was received from the new methods introduced by
          the rationalist school. Starting from rationalistic premises,
          [811]Johann Bernhard Basedow demanded in his Abhandlung vom
          Unterricht der Jugend in der Religion (Lübeck, 1764) that
          children should not be forced to memorize anything but what they
          already understood, and that they should be left to acquire new
          knowledge only by their own thinking, with the help of
          instructive questions. Basedow laid down these views in his
          catechism for two grades entitled Grundriss der Religion, welche
          durch Nachdenken und Bibelforschen erkannt wird (1764). This,
          which gradually became known as the Socratic method, was
          developed further by Karl Friedrich Bahrdt in his
          Philanthropinischer Erziehungsplan (Frankfort, 1776) and
          confirmed from the philosophy of Kant by Johann Friedrich
          Christian Graeffe in his Vollständiges Lehrbuch der allgemeinen
          Katechetik (Göttingen, 1799). Its most prominent representatives
          were Johann Peter Miller, Johann Christian Dolz, and especially
          Gustav Friedrich Dinter. With these new ideas new manuals
          appeared which either dropped altogether the old catechisms
          based on the articles of faith or relegated them to an appendix.
          Johann Gottfried Herder attempted to explain the smaller
          catechism of Luther according to the new principles (Weimar,
          1800). The weak point of the Socratic method is its inseparable
          connection with rationalist theology. Pestalozzi criticized this
          method because it tried to elicit from children what is not in
          them. Schleiermacher pointed out that the Socratic method
          ignored the revelation of the Christian religion and its
          history. Marheinecke, Nitzsch, Kraussold, Harms, and Hüffell
          followed him is opposition to it. The modern method of
          catechizing has retained from the Socratic method its feature of
          development; it does not, however, consider human reason and
          natural religion as the basis of this development, but rather
          the documents of revelation and the history of the Church.

    6. Modern German Lutheran Catechisms.

          The catechisms used in the different territories of Germany are
          too numerous to mention. In the territories of the Evangelical
          Union as well as among the orthodox Lutherans the Smaller
          Catechism of Luther forms the basis of instruction. But in
          accordance with their peculiar doctrines the Unionists have made
          concessions to the Reformed teachings, so that their manuals
          represent more or less a compromise between Luther's Smaller
          Catechism and the Heidelberg Catechism. The chief country of the
          Union is Prussia, and here the consistories in agreement with
          their respective provincial synods have selected a number of
          compendiums to be used in instruction. Manuals of the same sort
          are found in the other Unionistic territories, Anhalt, Baden,
          Hesse, Waldeck, Hanau, the Rhenish Palatinate, Nassau, and
          Birkenfeld.

          In the distinctively Lutheran territories Luther's Smaller
          Catechism is used everywhere, in Hesse in connection with the
          so-called Hessische Fragestücke, in Württemberg with Brenz's
          catechism. The text is at present formulated after the revision
          proposed by the Evangelical conference held at Eisenach in 1882.
          In the selection of aids to be used besides the text a certain
          freedom exists in Saxe-Coburg, in the Lutheran Church of
          Alsace-Lorraine, in Hamburg, in the Lutheran Church of the
          province of Hanover, and in Frankfort-on-the-Main. In certain
          places besides the text of the Smaller Catechism are mostly
          Spruchbücher, that is, collections of Bible texts and hymns. The
          use of such books for the explanation of Luther's catechism has
          been made obligatory in the kingdom of Saxony, in Altenburg,
          Meiningen, the principalities of Reuse, in Sleswick-Holstein and
          Eutin, in Oldenburg and Schaumburg-Lippe. Besides the
          Spruchbücher, various expositions of Luther's catechisms have
          been introduced, the use of which has been made obligatory in
          Mecklenburg-Schwerin, Lübeck, Mecklenburg-Strelitz, Brunswick,
          Schwarzburg-Sondershausen, Schwarzburg-Rudolstadt, the former
          county of Schaumburg, Weimar, Bavaria, and in the Free Lutheran
          Church of Prussia.

    7. Modern German Reformed Catechisms.

          As regards the Reformed territories, the Heidelberg Catechism is
          used in the Reformed Church of Lippe-Detmold, in the Reformed
          congregations of East Friesland, in the former county of
          Bentheim, in the synodal district of Bovenden (near Göttingen ),
          and in the confederation of Reformed Churches in Lower Saxony.
          In the Reformed territories of the consistorial district of
          Cassel (Lower Hesse) and in the synodal district of Hamburg the
          Hessischer Landeskatechismus, a Reformed revision of Luther's
          Smaller Catechism with the Hessische Fragestücke inserted, is
          used. In Bremen and in the Reformed Church of Alsace-Lorraine no
          special manual for religious instruction is prescribed.

    8. Switzerland.

          In Switzerland there appeared at St. Gallen in 1527 a
          compilation of the Kinderfragen of the Bohemian Brethren. About
          the same time OEcolampadius published his Kinderbericht for
          Basel. In 1534 Leo Jud published his catechism for Zurich. An
          epitome of it followed in the next year, which in 1598 was
          declared obligatory to the exclusion of the catechisms of
          Heinrich Bullinger (1559) and Burckhardt Leemann (1583), and was
          introduced also in Grisons and Schaffhausen. In 1536 Kaspar
          Grossmann (Megander) revised Jud's catechism for Bern; as in the
          course of time it was made to serve the views of Zwingli, it had
          to be revised anew, and in this form became known as the Bern
          Catechism. These old catechisms were either superseded or
          influenced by the Heidelberg Catechism. The Zurich Catechism of
          1609, the work of Marcus Bäumlein, originated in a combination
          of the Heidelberg Catechism with those used in Zurich. It was
          introduced in different cantons and used until 1839. Under the
          influence of rationalism most of the cantons adopted new
          catechisms between 1830 and 1850. Basel took the lead in 1832,
          then followed Zurich with a new catechism (1839). In French
          Switzerland Calvin's Catechismus Genevensis (1542) was used at
          the beginning. In the canton of Vaud it was replaced in 1552 by
          a translation of the Bern Catechism, which gave way to that of
          Heidelberg in the eighteenth century. In 1734 there appeared in
          Geneva the small catechism of Jean Frédéric Osterwald, which,
          after revision, was also adopted in Vaud. About 1620 Stephen
          Gabriel, pastor at Ilanz, compiled a catechism for the Romance
          districts which remained in use even after a translation of
          Osterwald's catechism had appeared. But entire freedom exists as
          to the choice of religious manuals in Switzerland. In many cases
          the individual preachers write their own books of instruction.

    9. Austria-Hungary.

          Since the edict of toleration of Joseph II., the Lutheran Church
          in Austria has used Luther's Smaller Catechism and the Reformed
          Church the Heidelberg Catechism. According to the constitution
          of the Evangelical Church in Austria, all further guides in
          religious instruction have to be sanctioned by the Evangelical
          Supreme Church Council in Vienna, and approved by the ministry
          of ecclesiastical affairs and public instruction. Some of the
          approved manuals are, in German, Buchrucker's and Ernesti's
          editions of Luther's Smaller Catechism, in Bohemian that of
          Molmar. Among those approved for the Reformed Church may be
          mentioned the enlarged German edition of the Heidelberg
          Catechism by Franz (Vienna, 1858), and the Bohemian by Von Tardy
          (Prague, 1867), and by Vesely (1885). In Hungary and
          Transylvania the same conditions exist as in Austria.

    10. Slavic Countries.

          In the Baltic provinces of Russia an Esthonian translation of
          the Smaller Catechism seems to have appeared as early as in
          1553. In 1586 a Lettish translation by J. Rivius was printed at
          Königsberg. It was revised in 1689 by E. Glück and used a long
          time among the Lettish congregations of Livonia. Another by H.
          Adolphi appeared in 1685 and found a large circulation in
          Courland. In accordance with a resolution of the Synod of
          Livonia and Courland in 1898, a new Lettish standard text has
          been established (Riga, 1898), which has supplanted all earlier
          translations. An Esthonian exposition of the Smaller Catechism
          was introduced in Esthonia in 1673 as the official catechism,
          and used almost exclusively until 1866. The catechism of Martin
          Körber (1864), modeled after the official catechism of
          Neustrelitz, has found a considerable circulation. The Germans
          in the Baltic provinces also produced numerous interpretations
          of their own; Jodocus Holst, Einfältige Auslegung des Kleinen
          Katechismus Luthers (Riga, 1596); Immanuel von Essen,
          Christliche Katechismusübung (1781); Werbatus, Dr. Martin
          Luthers Kleiner Katechismus (1895); and many others. For the
          Lutheran congregations of Poland there has been recently
          approved Maly Katechizm Doktora Marcina Lutra (Lublin, 1900). It
          is an exposition of the Smaller Catechism by Alexander
          Schönaich, preacher at Lublin. An official text of the Smaller
          Catechism has been published for the Russian-speaking Lutherans
          (St. Petersburg, 1865).

    11. Scandinavian Countries.

          The first catechetical writings in Sweden were a working-over of
          Luther's Betbüchlein, a translation of the revision of the
          Kinderfragen of the Bohemian Brethren published at Magdeburg in
          1524, and a translation of the Handbüchlein für junge Christen
          by Johann Toltz. The Smaller Catechism was translated by
          Laurentius Petri into Swedish perhaps as early as 1548; the
          oldest extant copy dates from 1572. 1n 1595 the Smaller
          Catechism was officially introduced, but came into general use
          only after the Church Order of 1686. An official translation of
          Luther's Larger Catechism dates from 1746. The exposition of the
          Smaller by Olaf Swebelius, which had been in use for some time,
          was revised in 1811 by Archbishop J. Axel Lindblom and
          introduced as an official catechism. In 1843 a new revision
          appeared, but in 1878 the Doktor Mårten Luthers Lilla Katekes
          med kort utveckling, stadfäst af konungen den 11. Oktober 1878
          took its place and is still used. In 1532 the Smaller Catechism
          was translated into Danish by Jorgen Jensen Sadolin. In 1537
          there appeared almost simultaneously two further translations,
          Den lille danske Catechismus by Franz Wormodson and Luthers
          lille Katekismus by Petrus Palladius. The latter was republished
          in 1538 as Enchiridion sive Manuale ut vocant and officially
          recognized. H. P. Petersen edited the Latin text of the Smaller
          Catechism side by side with a Danish translation for the use of
          schools (1608). In 1627 he used the Danish text for a manual
          destined for popular instruction. The text deviates frequently
          from the original, and these variants have crept into other
          compilations modeled after it. It retained its authority in
          Denmark until 1813, in Norway until 1843. The standard work for
          Norway is at present Dr. M. Luthers Lille Katekismus (9th ed.,
          Christiania, 1897), and for Denmark C. F. Balslev's Luthers
          Katekismua meden kort Forklaring (Copenhagen, 1899).

    12. Holland.

          In the Dutch Reformed Church absolute freedom exists in the
          choice of guides to be used in religious instruction. Besides
          the Geneva and Heidelberg catechisms, Abraham Hellenbroek's
          Vorbeeld der goddelyke Waarheden has been used.

    13. England.

          The Established Church of England uses to-day the catechism from
          the Book of Common Prayer, with but slight changes from the
          original form of 1552. An exposition of it by John Palmer
          (London, 1894) shows the text of the original catechism in
          prominent type and provides each individual paragraph with an
          introduction. The Congregationalists have also adopted the
          catechism of the Established Church, but besides this they use a
          manual by Samuel Palmer, A Catechism for Protestant Dissenters
          (London, 1772, 29th ed., 1890), which contains a brief history
          of non-conformity and treats of the reasons for it. In the
          Sunday-schools the Congregationalists use a catechism by J.
          Hilton Stowell revised by A. M. Fairbairn (1892). The
          Presbyterian Church of England and the Church of Scotland have
          accepted the Westminster Catechism as the basis of their
          instruction. It is divided into the doctrines we are to believe
          and the duties we are to perform (The Moral Law; Faith and
          Repentance; Sacraments; Prayer). The form of religious
          instruction chiefly cultivated in England is the Sunday-school,
          for which the Sunday-school Union furnishes manuals. Dr. Watt's
          first and second catechisms have also found a large circulation;
          the former contains a short survey of the doctrines of Christian
          salvation and especially a catechism on Scriptural names, the
          latter an interpretation of the decalogue and information on the
          sacraments and prayers. Before the catechism of the Book of
          Common Prayer appeared, Luther's Smaller Catechism was used for
          several years in England; at the instance of Cranmer the
          Nuremberg Kinderpredigten which interpret it was in 1548
          translated into English under the title A Short Introduction
          into the Christian Religion.

    14. France.

          In the French Reformed Church Calvin's catechism of 1542 was at
          one time almost universally used, later with Osterwald's smaller
          catechism, but has now been superseded by Bonnefon's Nouveau
          catéchisme élémentaire (14th ed., Alais, 1900) and Decoppet's
          Catéchisme populaire (Paris). Less popular are Babut's Cours de
          religion chrétienne (6th ed., 1897) and Nyegaard's Catéchisme à
          l'usage des Églises evangéliques (13th ed., 1900). The Free
          Church uses the same catechisms. In the "Église de la Confession
          d'Augsbourg" Luther's Smaller Catechism has always been in use.
          The Petit catéchisme de Luther (Chateauroux) has added to
          Luther's text Bible texts and stories and renders the Ten
          Commandments exactly as they are found in Ex. xx. 1-17,
          combining the ninth and tenth commandments and treating the
          prohibition of the worship of images as a separate commandment.

    15. Italy.

          As a result of the Evangelical movement in Italy, there
          originated about 1535 the "Christian Instruction for Children"
          by Juan de Valdés, apparently first written in Spanish, but
          published first in Italian and then translated into various
          languages (cf. the polyglot edition of E. Böhmer under the title
          Instruction cristiana para los niños por Juan de Valdés, Bonn,
          1883). To-day the "Free Church" uses Il catechismo ossia sunto
          della dottrina cristiana secondo la parola di Dio, by G. P.
          Meille (Florence, 6th ed., 1895). Of a similar nature are the
          catechisms used by the Waldenses, Catechismo della Chiesa
          evangelica Valdese o Manuale d'istruzione cristiana ad uso dei
          catecumeni di detta Chiesa (1866) and Catechismo evangelico
          ossia sunto della dottrina christiana (1895).

    16. American Lutheran Catechisms.

          The Lutherans in the United States use Luther's Smaller
          Catechism, which exists in many German, English, and
          German-English editions. In the Synodical Conference the Dresden
          Kreuzkatechismus of 1688 has a large circulation, in the
          Missouri Synod Dr. M. Luthers Kleiner Katechismus in Frage und
          Antwort gründlich ausgelegt by J. K. Dietrich (St. Louis, Mo.)
          and a condensed edition of the same are much used; the former
          also in English. In the Ohio Synod originated Der Kleine
          Catechismus Dr. M. Luthers mit erklärenden und beweisenden
          Bibelstellen, also in English (Allentown, Pa.). It contains
          besides the Smaller Catechism the "Order of Salvation," that is,
          a survey of the whole contents of Christian doctrine, an
          analysis of the catechism formed like Spener's catechetical
          tables, and the Württemberg Konferenz-Examen, which is an
          epitome of the Kinderlehre introduced in 1682 in Württemberg.
          Prof. M. Loy, Prof. F. W. Stellhorn, and Rev. C. H. Rohe wrote
          an exposition of the Smaller Catechism on the basis of
          Dietrich's, under the title Dr. M. Luthers Kleiner Katechismus,
          in Frage und Antwort ausgelegt (Columbus, O., 1882). On the
          basis of Caspari's catechetical exposition, W. J. Mann and G. F.
          Krotel, of the Synod of Pennsylvania, published Luthers Kleiner
          Katechismus in Fragen und Antworten zum Gebrauch in Kirche,
          Schule and Haus (Allentown, 1863). The General Council uses also
          a catechism which contains the Württemberg Konferenz-Examen as
          an appendix. It appeared under the title Dr. M. Luthers Kleiner
          Katechismus mit Erklärung für die evangelisch-lutherlische
          Kirche in den Vereinigten Staaten, also in English (New York). A
          recent addition explains Luther's text by Bible texts and
          stories--Luthers Kleiner Katechismus mit Bibelsprüchen
          (Philadelphia). The German-Evangelical synod, which is akin to
          the Evangelical Union in Germany, has published its own official
          catechism, Kleiner evangelischer Katechismus, also an edition
          with German and English on parallel pages (St. Louis). It is a
          free revision of the Smaller Catechism, differing from it
          especially in the doctrine of the sacraments. The German
          Reformed Church uses a catechism prepared in 1862 by Philip
          Schaff and entitled Christlicher Katechismus: ein Leitfaden zum
          Religionsunterricht in Schule und Haus (Philadelphia). These
          rather comprehensive books are intended for the school and
          especially for young people to be confirmed. In the numerous
          Sunday-schools the children are frequently instructed only in
          Biblical stories. A catechism intended for that purpose is The
          Little Lamb's Catechism by J. R. Lauritzen (Knoxville, Tenn.).
          The same author wrote another manual which has become very
          popular--Dr. M. Luther's Kleiner Katechismus, also in English
          (Knoxville, Tenn.). The German-Evangelical Synod possesses an
          excellent manual for the instruction of Sunday-schools in Kurze
          Katechismuslehre (St. Louis, 1899), which extends its material
          over three grades and is considered a preparation for the
          catechism proper.

    17. The Moravians and Bohemian Brethren.

          In the German Moravian congregations the department for churches
          and schools under the direction of the Unitas Fratrum has
          reserved to itself the right of selecting manuals to be used is
          instruction. Luther's Smaller Catechism is chiefly used, in some
          places also Hauptinhalt der christlichen Heilslehre zum Gebrauch
          bei dem Unterricht der Jugend in den evangelischen
          Brüdergemeinden (8th ed., Gnadau, 1891), compiled by Samuel
          Lieberkühn in 1769. Among the Bohemian Brethren the Katechismus
          der christlichen Lehre zum Gebrauch bei dem Unterricht der
          Jugend in den evangelischen Brüdergemeinden (Dauba) has become
          the standard. It is based upon a catechism written by L. T.
          Reichel for the American congregations of Brethren. Among the
          earlier catechisms which are out of use now may be mentioned
          Zinzendorf's works--;his strange production Lautere Milch der
          Lehre von Jesu Christo (1723) and his Gewisser Grund
          christlicher Lehre nach Anleitung des einfachen Catechismi seel.
          Herrn Dr. Luthers (1725).

    18. Methodist Catechisms.

          Among the German-speaking Methodists of the United States the
          only books used are the manuals written at the order of the
          General Conference in 1868 by Wilhelm Nast in Cincinnati,
          especially with the aid of Schaff's catechism, Der grössere
          [kleinere] Katechismus für die deutschen Gemeinden der
          Bischöflichen Methodistenkirche (Cincinnati). The English
          Methodists use A Brief Catechism for the Use of Methodists
          Compiled by Order of the Conference (London) and The Catechism
          of the Wesleyan Methodists (ib.). The latter work consists
          really of three catechisms, arranged in gradation for pupils of
          different ages.

    19. Baptist and Irvingite Catechisms.

          The manuals used among the Baptists in Germany are Rode's
          Christlicher Religionsunterricht für die reifere Jugend
          (Hamburg, 1882) and Kaiser's Leitfaden für den
          Religionsunterricht, which first appeared in English under the
          title of Prize Catechism. Besides these, Weert's Katechismus,
          ein Leitfaden für den Religionsunterricht (Cassel, 1899) is
          used. [Several catechisms were prepared by English Particular
          Baptists in the seventeenth century: A Soul Searching Catechism,
          by Christopher Blackwood (1653); Catechism for Children, by
          Henry Jersey (1673); The Child's Instructor: a New and Easy
          Primer, by Benjamin Krach (1664). The General Assembly of the
          Particular Baptists at its session in London in June, 1693,
          requested William Collins to draw up a catechism "containing the
          substance of the Christian religion, for the instruction of
          children and servants." It has been reproduced in authentic form
          in Confessions of Faith, and other Documents, edited for the
          Hanserd Knollys Society, by E. B. Underhill (London, 1854).
          Among the Baptists of the United States in the South and
          Southwest Question Books (four series) by A. C. Dayton, and a
          Catechism by J. A. Broadus, have been widely used.

          A H. N.]

          The catechism of the Irvingites contains three chapters; the
          first two represent practically the Prayer-book catechism; the
          third part treats of the doctrines peculiar to the Irvingites,
          the doctrine of the Church and its offices.

          [For the catechisms used in most Presbyterian communions see
          [812]Westminster Standards.]

    20. Unitarian Catechisms.

          The English Unitarians use especially two small manuals--Ten
          Lessons in Religion by Charles Beard (London, 2d ed., 1897) and
          A Catechism of Religion by H. W. Hawkes. While the former
          contains only an exposition of the Lord's Prayer and instruction
          on the Bible, the latter treats in fifty-two questions of the
          most important terms in Christian faith and interprets them in
          the Unitarian sense. The latter is in some respects dependent on
          An Evangelical Free Church Catechism for Use in Home and School
          (London), which is used by Unitarians, Methodists, Baptists,
          Congregationalists, Presbyterians, and some smaller
          denominations.

    21. Roman Catholic and Old Catholic Catechisms.

          The Roman Catholic Church learned from the Evangelicals its
          solicitude for the religious instruction of youth. Numerous
          manuals appeared as imitations of Evangelical catechisms. The
          catechism of John Dietenberger, a very popular book, was in some
          passages copied verbatim from Luther's. But all the catechisms
          previously published were far surpassed in popularity by the
          Summa doctrinæ christianæ, per quæstiones tradita et ad capitum
          rudiorum accommodata (1556) by the Jesuit Peter Canisius. It
          forms an epitome of his Summa doctrinæ christianæ of 1555 and
          was translated into all European languages. It was used even in
          India and remained for about two centuries the principal
          catechism of the Roman Catholic Church. In 1559 Canisius
          enlarged it under the title Parvus Catechismus catholicorum,
          which became the model for numerous expositions of the Summa. In
          1566 appeared the Catechismus ex decreto Concilii Tridentini ad
          Parochos Pii V. Pontificis Maximi iussu editus, intended as a
          homiletical and catechetical handbook for the clergy; but the
          influence of the Jesuits was so great that it could not compete
          with the catechisms of Canisius; and even those of Bellarmin,
          which appeared in 1598, did not attain equal popularity with
          them. The Roman Catholic books of instruction, like the
          Evangelical catechisms, did not escape the influence of
          rationalism, at first in method and then even to some extent in
          contents. A return to the stricter teaching of the Church made
          itself felt in the first decades of the nineteenth century.
          Since 1847 J. Deharbe's catechisms have been generally
          recognized as standard works. They include Katholischer
          Katechismus für Stadt- und Landschulen (Regensburg, 1847); and
          Kleiner katholischer Katechismus zunächst für solche
          Landschulen, welche nur während des Sommer-oder Wintersemesters
          besucht werden (1847). In the United States the Catholic Church
          provides manuals of catechetical instruction, such as those
          edited by W. Faerber in German and English (St. Louis, 1897 and
          often), and Catechisms of Catholic Teaching (New York, n.d.).

          The Old Catholic Church has two official catechisms, the
          Katholische Katechismus, herausgegeben im Auftrage der
          altkatholischen Synode (Bonn) and Leitfaden für den katholischen
          Religionsunterricht an höheren Schulen, herausgegeben im
          Auftrage der altkatholischen Synode (Bonn, 1877).

    22. The Greek Church.

          In 1721 the synod of the Russian Orthodox Church decreed that
          three small manuals for the instruction of youth and the common
          people should be made, one on the principal doctrines of faith
          and on the decalogue, a second on the special duties of each
          class, and a third containing sermons on the principal
          doctrines, virtues, and vices. On the strength of this order
          there appeared a book entitled "First Instruction of Youth,
          Containing a Primer and a Short Exposition of the Decalogue, the
          Lord's Prayer and the Creed, by order of his Majesty Peter L,
          emperor of all the Russias," which is probably the first real
          catechism in the Greek Church. The catechism used at the present
          time, the "Complete Christian Catechism of the Ortho dox
          Catholic Eastern Church," first published in 1839, originated
          under the influence of a manual composed by Jeromonach Platon in
          1765 for the heir to the throne, the Grand Duke Paul Petrovitch,
          which is influenced in the arrangement of material by the
          Confessio orthodoxa of Peter Mogilas (1643). Like the latter, it
          groups its material under the three Christian virtues of faith,
          hope, and love. After an introduction on revelation, Holy
          Scripture, and catechetical teaching, it begins with an
          exposition of the Nicene Creed, followed by the Lord's Prayer
          and the Beatitudes, the union between faith and love, and an
          exposition of the Ten Commandments. The book closes with the
          application of the doctrine of faith and of piety.

  CATECHUMENATE.

   Catechumenate
          Earliest Data (§ 1).

          According to the Church Fathers (§ 2).

          First Period of Development (§ 3).

          Second Period of Developent (§ 4).

          Decline of the Catechumenate (§ 5).

          Ritual Survivals (§ 6).

    1. Earliest Data.

          Catechumenate is a term applied to the method of receiving and
          instructing, in preparation for baptism, those who applied for
          membership in the early Christian Church. As soon as the
          apostolic mission had reached the stage of founding a Christian
          society, it was natural that those who wished to enter it should
          be required to go through a course of instruction as to the
          meaning of the hopes which it held out and the demands which it
          made of its members. Our information as to the method pursued in
          the earliest period is very scanty. Apparently the gatherings of
          the disciples were at first freely opened to any one (I Cor.
          xiv. 24) who desired to know more of their faith and practise;
          and baptism was probably often administered with but a short
          delay. As time went on, more care was exercised; the need of it
          was demonstrated by cases of relapse into heathenism and of the
          seeking of membership from interested or treacherous motives. We
          find traces of this greater caution as early as the first
          Apology of Justin (c. 150). A demand is made for some security
          as to the belief and conduct of the candidate, who is not
          apparently admitted to the assembly of the faithful until he has
          been adjudged worthy of baptism. How this security was obtained
          is not clear; the preparation seems to have been private, and
          the one who conducted it probably answered for the candidate, as
          at once sponsor and catechist.

    2. According to the Church Fathers.

          Tertullian portrays a somewhat different system; though
          catechumens are still excluded from the assembly, the
          application of this name to them implies that they were already
          reckoned as in a sense belonging to the Church and under its
          care. This is still more clearly the case in Origen's account.
          The much discussed passage Contra Celsum, iii. 51 shows plainly
          that there was a definite system of examination and of
          instruction. It gives also the fact that at this period, besides
          the class which (as in Justin and Tertullian) is excluded from
          the assembly, there is another which has advanced far enough to
          claim the privilege of admission, and is only waiting for the
          last decisive step of baptism. It is a mistake to attempt to
          deduce from his words three classes divided by a hard and fast
          line, or to apply to these classes the names audientes (Gk.
          akroOmenoi), genuflectente (gonuklinontes), and competentes
          (phOtizomenoi). The last occurs in the Apostolic Constitutions,
          and in Cyril of Jerusalem passim, for the candidates approaching
          baptism, who are definitely distinguished from the catechumens.
          The name akroOmenoi occurs for the first time in the passage of
          Origen referred to, but without a distinct meaning; its use
          later in the proclamation of the deacon in the liturgy,
          summoning those not entitled to be present to depart, relates to
          a class of penitents not allowed to hear a part of the service
          to which catechumens were admitted. In like manner the
          application of gonuklinontes to a class of catechumens rests on
          a misunderstanding of the corrupt Greek text of the fifth canon
          of the Synod of Neocæsarea (314), which really means that
          catechumens falling into sin are to be put among the penitents,
          and expelled altogether if they do not amend.

    3. First Period of Development.

          To sum up, then, what has been said, Origen shows a development
          of the catechumenate from what Justin gives, while Tertullian
          exhibits an intermediate stage. We must, however, remember that
          these witnesses are from different parts of the Church. The
          development was probably largely influenced by local conditions.
          In Tertullian's time, Septimius Severua had forbidden
          conversions to Christianity, and formal arrangements for the
          preparation of converts would have been direct rebellion. In
          Origen's day, on the other hand, the Church had enjoyed a long
          period of peace, and was not afraid to allow trusted catechumens
          to be present at its services; but the large number of converts
          made it more probable that some unworthy ones would be among
          them, and so to the original examination before baptism, a
          second and earlier one was added. Origen's account of the
          catechumenate gives all the essential features of the
          institution, as we meet with it when fully established, after
          persecution had ceased. Christianity had become the state
          religion, and it was possible to work out in detail institutions
          which had been carefully planned in the dark days preceding.

    4. Second Period of Development.

          This second or established period covers roughly the fourth and
          early fifth centuries. The candidate, accompanied by a sponsor,
          announces his desire, normally to a deacon, who informs the
          bishop or presbyter. The grounds of his desire are investigated;
          people of certain sinful or dubious occupations are ipso facto
          excluded unless they will abandon them. If the candidate is
          acceptable, he receives a preliminary instruction, and is then
          set apart by the sign of the cross, laying on of hands, and (in
          the West) with blessed salt, as a catechumen. For a time he
          receives no special instruction, sharing that which the whole
          congregation gets in the missa catechumenorum, though departing
          before the later and more solemn part of the liturgy. After two
          (or three) years, he may ask for baptism; he enters the class of
          competentes, and his name is inscribed on the church list. The
          immediate preparation includes special instructions, usually
          given by the bishop; certain ceremonies, especially of exorcism,
          which show the influence of the pagan mysteries; and finally the
          traditio symboli, or instruction in the precise words of the
          baptismal creed, whose general sense has long been known to him.
          After learning and repeating this, he is taught the words of the
          Lord's Prayer, which has also been withheld from him until now
          by the [813]Arcani disciplina. The recitation of the creed as a
          solemn act and the final renunciation of paganism accompany the
          act of baptism, which usually takes place in the night before
          Easter. During the following week the neophyte receives further
          instructions, and on the next Sunday, still wearing his white
          baptismal robe, he takes his place among the congregation as a
          baptized Christian, and joins in the recitation of the Lord's
          Prayer, the prayer of the children of God. As to the matter
          contained in the instructions to the catechumen in this period,
          fullest information comes from Augustine in the West and Cyril
          of Jerusalem in the East.

    5. Decline of the Catechumenate.

          The decline of the institution was brought about by the
          constantly increasing numbers of those who sought admission to
          the Church. A thorough examination of them all became
          impossible; the preliminary instruction was gradually dropped,
          and the catechumenate was reduced to the immediate preparation
          for baptism. The growing practise of baptizing infants and young
          children completed the process, since there was no place for
          instruction in their case. Something still remained, however, of
          the ancient procedure.

    6. Ritual Survivals.

          On the Monday after the third Sunday in Lent, notice was given
          to present the children who were to be baptized at Easter. On
          the following Wednesday their sponsors brought them to the
          church, where their names were registered. The ceremonies of
          signing with the cross, laying on of hands, exorcism, giving of
          salt, and a final prayer made them catechumens. Seven masses
          were said on succeeding days, five containing similar
          ceremonies, while the last two were especially solemn. The sixth
          contained the "opening of the ears," a reminder of the ancient
          traditio symboli; the book of the Gospels was borne in
          procession to the altar and a short extract from each Gospel
          read, after which the creed was given to the candidates, and an
          acolyte brought forward two children, a boy and a girl, and
          recited the creed for them (the ancient redditio symboli); with
          the subsequent communication of the Lord's Prayer were usually
          connected short expositions of each clause. The last "scrutiny"
          took place the day before Easter, and followed much the same
          order, but more solemnly and formally; and baptism took place at
          the traditional time.

          When the time came that nothing remained of the original
          institutions of the catechumenate except the outward ceremonies,
          these were more and more condensed, until they formed but a
          single rite leading up to the baptism which immediately followed
          them. In the Ordo baptismi of the Roman Ritual the order of the
          ancient preparations for baptism may still be traced without
          difficulty, and not a few relics of it remain in the evangelical
          baptismal ceremonies (see [814]Baptism).

          (Ferdinand Cohrs.)

          A very interesting survival of the ancient catechumenate is
          found in the Armenian work found among the modern Paulicians,
          translated and edited by F. C. Conybeare (The Key of Truth: A
          Manual of the Paulician Church of Armenia, Oxford, 1898) and
          believed by the editor to have been written not later than the
          ninth century and to represent an almost primitive form of
          Oriental Christianity. It is adoptionist in its Christology and
          drastic in its opposition to infant-baptism. It provides for a
          solemn consecration of the infant of Christian parents by the
          minister when it is seven days old, the careful training by
          parents and church until maturity is reached, the thorough
          testing of the candidates for baptism in life and in knowledge
          of Christian doctrine and morals, and the administration of
          baptism with considerable ceremony to those who have fulfilled
          all the conditions and have attained to the age at which Christ
          was baptized. A brief catechism, embracing the points of
          doctrine in which catechumens must be grounded, is given at the
          end.

          The term catena, "a chain" (plural, catenæ), designates a
          commentary on Holy Scripture made up by piecing together short
          extracts from the Fathers and older writers. This plan of
          construction was suggested by the accumulation of exegetical
          materials made both by Origen and his school and by the
          theologians of Antioch in the third and fourth centuries.

    1. Origin.

          The principal motive which impelled later scholars to collect
          and examine the early utterances was a dogmatic one. After the
          conversion of Constantine, the Church was anxious to put
          together in a clear and systematic form the results of previous
          theological work, and to emphasize the connection of the past
          with the present. For this purpose in regard to doctrine the
          decrees of the ecumenical councils answered admirably; but it
          was not so easy to attain the same result in the exposition of
          Scripture. The problem was to represent the results arrived at
          by the recognized commentators in propositions that had a unity
          of scheme and an admitted authority. The principles of its
          solution are laid down in the nineteenth canon of the Quinisext
          (Second Trullan) Council: that Holy Scripture is the standard of
          truth, that the limits of doctrine already fixed and the
          traditions of the Fathers are not to be transgressed, and that
          if any question concerning the Scripture comes up, it is to be
          expounded in no other way than as the great teachers of the past
          have given it in their works. The exposition of the Scripture
          was thus firmly attached to the recognized orthodox doctrine.
          The second canon of the same council had named some of the
          "lights and doctors" who were to be followed, and the first
          canon had given warning against all heretics, not merely against
          Arius, Macedonius, Apollinaris, and Nestorius, but also against
          Theodore of Mopsuestia, Origen, Didymus, Evagrius, and
          Theodoret. It was, however, found impossible to carry out these
          principles strictly. The writings of the authors suspected of
          heresy offered material too valuable to be neglected; and it was
          found impossible to arrive at a unity of results in an anthology
          of this kind without doing violence to the individuality of the
          authors and damaging their authority, so that nothing could be
          done but to put together what was selected.

    2. Meaning of the Term.

          In this manner arose the collections of extracts which are so
          characteristic of Byzantine theology, covering all the books of
          the Bible (especially Genesis, Job, the Psalms, Canticles,
          Isaiah, Matthew, and John) by extracts from patristic
          commentators, and setting an example of method which was widely
          followed in Western and medieval commentaries. These collections
          are usually known as Catenæ (Seirai). The origin of the name is
          obscure, but its meaning is plain. It refers to collections of
          material put together in a purely external but visible
          connection, and strung upon the thread of the text. There may
          have been originally a mystical significance attached to it. As
          the hermetic chain of the later Neoplatonists symbolized the
          harmonious conjunction of the bearers of wisdom to the world,
          hand joined in hand from the earliest to later times, so the
          line of the Fathers was to hand down the approved expositions of
          the one true Church.

    3. Sources.

          The first compilers have no fixed phrases to describe their
          process; but their lengthy titles give an idea of the plan they
          set before them. They collected their material according to the
          maxim of Seneca, Quod verum est, meum est ("What is true is
          mine"). The manner in which literary property was handled in the
          ancient world permitted not only straightforward appropriation
          of other people's work, but the utmost freedom in adaptation to
          the borrower's special purpose. The retention of the original
          authors' names here is an evidence of the weight attached to
          their testimony as authoritative expositors; where the compiler
          adds comments of his own, he is usually careful to distinguish
          his additions. Great variety is found in the manner of
          reproduction and in the extent of the material included. In the
          Catena of Possinus on Matthew we have one constructed on the
          exact lines laid down by the Quinisext Council--a mosaic of
          verbal citations from commentaries or other writings of orthodox
          Fathers. Where the compiler, like Nicetas of Serræ, added
          reflections of his own, he generally put them at the head of the
          group of quotations following a fresh section of the text. Where
          he adapted and condensed, he either kept to the serial order, or
          worked over all the material he had accumulated without making
          divisions for the separate authors. This is the manner adopted
          by Procopius, (OEcumenius, and Theophylact, who emphasize at the
          same time the fact that they are not originators but
          transmitters. There is no sharp dividing line between this kind
          of Catena and the Byzantine commentary; for the latter also
          patristic tradition is the standard, though the sources are not
          indicated in the margin as is usually the case in the Catenæ,
          and the exposition proceeds without a break.

    4. Value.

          The value of the Catenæ is measured by their judgment in
          selecting and their skill in combining the material they borrow.
          The difficulty of choice is increased by the dogmatic
          limitations, which are sometimes in inevitable conflict with the
          scholarly interest. Origen, for instance, the first great
          Christian critic and commentator, was of inestimable value to
          exegesis; and for the Old Testament Catenæ both Philo, who had
          been studied by all learned theologians from Origen down, and
          Josephus were invaluable authorities. A compromise was reached
          in the principle (still followed by Roman Catholic commentators)
          of Cyril of Alexandria: "We need not avoid or question
          everything that heretics have said; for they confess many things
          which we also confess." Another difficulty was found in the
          occasionally conflicting expositions; their diversity was
          explained by Drungarius, with reference to the obscurity of the
          text, as providential. He contents himself with placing side by
          side the varying renderings and explanations of Isaiah, leaving
          the reader to form his own judgment.

    5. Method.

          The simplest method of making a Catena was to follow one
          principal authority, to whose exposition shorter scholia are
          added from other sources. Thus Chrysoatom is the main source in
          the Catena of Possinus on Matthew, as well as in the Gospel
          commentaries of Euthymius and Theophylact, though all of these
          differ in the additions they make to what they take from him.
          Other Catenæ are indiscriminate anthologies, no one authority
          being preferred. Of this type are those of Procopius and
          Nicetas, and most of those on the Epistles.

    6. Form.

          The external form of the Catenæ differed according to their
          extent. Where they were not too extensive, the text was placed
          in the middle of the page, surrounded by the exposition, usually
          in smaller characters, sometimes even in tachygraphy. The names
          of the authorities are sometimes in the margin, sometimes in the
          body of the exposition, as a rule abbreviated. Occasionally
          diacritical marks show the connection between text and
          commentary. If the Catena is too extensive to allow this
          arrangement, the sections of the text are followed by the
          commentary, in separate paragraphs, with the authors' names on
          the margin, or else written without a break. The manuscripts, of
          which few date further back than the tenth century, differ much
          in execution. Some are of admirable workmanship, with
          illustrations; others are plain copies for students, with the
          marks of long use upon them, and some seem to have been hastily
          and carelessly made to supply the demand of the bookselling
          trade. Besides the commentaries, the Catenæ contain a good deal
          of introductory or illustrative matter. Thus the Gospels are
          frequently prefaced by the canons of Eusebius and his epistle to
          Carpianus, as well as by arguments and biographies of the
          evangelists; the Pauline epistles have a life of Paul, a list of
          his journeys, and an account of his martyrdom.

    7. Catenæ Previous to the Fourteenth Century.

          Whether the beginnings of the manufacture of Catenæ can be
          traced back to the patristic period it is impossible to say with
          certainty, though it seems not improbable. After Eusebius the
          work of theologians to a great extent took the direction of
          codifying and criticizing what had been handed down. But
          Procopius (d. 528) is the first who can be demonstrated to have
          made Catenæ. The value of his work, which rests not only upon
          the Fathers from the third to the fifth century but upon
          Josephus and Philo and upon some of the teachers before Origen,
          gave it an epoch-making position. From the manner in which he
          speaks of his task in the prefaces to Genesis and Isaiah, we may
          conjecture that he was not an imitator of others but an
          originator in this line. Other extant Catenæ were compiled by
          Andreas the presbyter (seventh to tenth century); Johannes
          Drungarius (tenth century); Michael Psellus, and Nicetas, bishop
          of Serræ, later metropolitan of Heraclea in Thrace (eleventh
          century); Nicolaus Muzalon and Neophytus Eucleistus (twelfth
          century); and Macarius Chrysocephalus (fourteenth century). To
          these may be added not only the commentaries arranged more or
          less in catena style, though without names of authorities:
          OEcumenius, of whose date and personality we know nothing
          certain, though he was probably a contemporary of Arethas of
          Cappadocia; and the Gospel commentaries of Theophylact and
          Euthymius, composed under the Comneni. There is, however, a much
          larger number of anonymous Catenæ; and this fact is surprising,
          since Byzantine theologians were not given to hiding their light
          under a bushel. It may possibly be explained by the theory that
          these Catenæ were produced not by any one man but by a group of
          collaborators. Their dates are very hard to determine; the
          surest way to reach conclusions on this point is by examining
          their relations to those whose dates we know, which requires a
          good deal more investigation than has yet been given to them. In
          fact, what has been done in the way of scientific study of the
          Catenæ in general has only covered certain specific points; and
          those which have been printed cover only a small part of the
          extant material, and that not always selected with judgment.

    8. Medieval Catenæ.

          The catena form impressed itself as a model upon medieval
          exegesis in the West, which also imitated the spirit in which
          the Eastern compilers went about their work. Here too the aim
          was to preserve the tradition of the Church in a uniform
          arrangement of Scriptural exposition, "so that the line of
          prophetic and apostolic interpretation may follow the norm of
          the ecclesiastical and catholic sense" (Vincent of Lerins). The
          principal sources were Ambrose, Hilary, Augustine, and Jerome;
          less often the Greek Fathers, such as Origen, Chrysostom, and
          Cyril of Alexandria, are cited. The prototypes of the medieval
          catena commentaries may be seen in the expositions of
          Cassiodorus and Isidore of Seville. On the Carolingian period
          the numerous commentaries of Bede exercised a decisive
          influence. He knew Greek, and shows some feeling for textual
          criticism; but he was not an exegetical individuality. He
          collects his fragments of exposition mainly from Jerome,
          Ambrose, Augustine, and Gregory, and lays his chief stress on
          the edifying explanation of the moral and mystical sense. In
          this tendency he was followed by Alcuin, Rabanus Maurus,
          Walafried Strabo, Dietrich of Hersfeld, Haimo, and Remigius of
          Auxerre, all less careful in the reproduction of their sources
          than Bede, with whom it was a matter of principle to designate
          clearly the intellectual property of his authorities. Among
          later commentaries of the catena sort especial influence was
          exerted by that of Peter Lombard on the Pauline epistles, which
          made no pretense of indicating sources, and the Catena Aurea of
          Thomas Aquinas on the Gospels, which makes use of some Greek
          Fathers as well as of Augustine, Jerome, Rabanus, and Remigius.
          Mention should also be made of the "glosses"--the Glossa
          ordinaria of Walafried Strabo, the Glossa interlinealis of
          Anselm of Laon (1110), and the Postillæ perpetuæ of Nicholas of
          Lyra (1340; see [816]Glosses, Biblical and Ecclesiastical).

    9. Post-Reformation Catenæ.

          These works lead up to the exegetical collections which were
          made after the Reformation and under its influence. The
          expository standpoint was different, but the method of
          compilation remained the same. They either gave the observations
          of certain selected expositors side by side without change, or
          they made groups of extracts from as large a number as possible.
          Instances of the first method are the Biblia magna of De la Haye
          (Paris, 1643), the Biblia maxima (ib. 1660), the English
          Annotations upon all the Books of the Old and New Testament
          (London, 1645), and the Critici sacri edited by J. Pearson and
          others (ib. 1660). The second class is represented by Matthew
          Pole's Synopsis criticorum aliorumque scripturæ sacræ
          interpretum et commentatorum (London, 1669), which contains the
          most varied extracts from more than eighty theologians of all
          ages and beliefs, even including the Jewish. The Roman Catholic
          expositors, such as Cornelius a Lapide, Estius, and Calmet,
          followed the lines laid down by the older Catenæ, to which,
          however, with their uncritical subservience to a tradition
          presupposed as authoritative, they are far inferior.

   Catharine, Saint, of Bologna
          CATHARINE, SAINT, OF BOLOGNA: Roman Catholic saint; b. at
          Bologna or, according to other accounts, at Verona Sept. 8,
          1413; d. at Bologna Mar. 9, 1463. About 1430 she entered the
          order of the Poor Clares at Ferrara after having been a lady of
          honor at the court of Princess Margaret of Este for about two
          years. She later became abbess of a convent of her order which
          was founded at Bologna. Her name was included in the Roman
          martyrology in 1592, and she was canonized by Benedict XIII. in
          1724. Later tradition wove many legends about her name, and her
          body was preserved undecayed in her convent until recent years.
          To St. Catherine is ascribed a prophetic work entitled
          Revelationes, sive de septem armis spiritualibus, composed about
          1438 and first edited probably at Bologna in 1475 and repeatedly
          since. In art she is represented in the habit of the Poor
          Clares, carrying the Christ-child, since the Virgin is said to
          have appeared to her and to have placed in her arms the infant
          Jesus in his swaddling-clothes.

   Catharine, Saint, of Genoa
          CATHARINE, SAINT, OF GENOA: Roman Catholic saint; b. at Genoa
          1447; d. there Sept. 14, 1510. She was the daughter of Roberto
          Fieschi, who had been viceroy of Naples under René of Anjou.
          Despite her desire for a life of religion, she was obliged to
          marry a nobleman of her native city named Giuliano Adorno,
          whence she is often called Catharina Flisca Adurna. After a life
          of extravagance her husband died in 1474, but not before he had
          been converted by his wife's piety and had become a Franciscan
          of the third order. For the remainder of her life his widow, as
          a member of the order of the Annunciation of St. Marcellina, was
          distinguished both for her care of the sick in the Genoese
          hospital Pammatone (especially during the plagues of 1497 and
          1501) and by her extreme asceticism. For twenty-three years
          during the seasons of Lent and Advent she is said to have fasted
          absolutely, taking at most a glass of water with salt and
          vinegar "to cool the raging flame within." She was formally
          canonized by Clement XII. in 1737, and the following pope,
          Benedict XIV., placed her name in the Roman martyrology,
          appointing her feast for Mar. 22. St. Catherine was one of the
          numerous mystic and prophetic authors of the latter part of the
          Middle Ages and wrote Demonstratio purgatorii or Tractatus de
          purgatorio (ed. C. Marabotto and E. Vernazza in their biography
          of St. Catherine, Genoa, 1551; Eng. transl., London, 1858),
          Dialogus animam inter et corpus, amorem proprium, spiritum,
          humanitatem ac Deum, and a treatise on the Christian life (both
          contained in the edition already mentioned). Her visions were
          assailed by Adrian Baillet in his Vies des saints (Paris, 1701)
          from the Gallican point of view, but other Roman Catholic
          authorities, such as St. Francis of Sales and the modern Jesuit
          Christian Pesch, have esteemed them highly.

   Catharine, Saint, the Martyr (Saint Catharine of Alexandria)
          CATHARINE, SAINT, THE MARTYR (SAINT CATHARINE OF ALEXANDRIA):
          One of the most honored saints both of the Eastern and the
          Western Church. Many modern hagiographers identify her with a
          wealthy and noble Christian lady of Alexandria who, according to
          Eusebius (Hist. eccl., VIII. xiv. 15), resisted the licentious
          advances of the emperor Maximinus, and was consequently deprived
          of her estates and banished. This identification, however, does
          not agree with the statement of Rufinus (Hist. eccl., viii. 17)
          that this lady was named Dorothea, nor does it harmonize with
          the legend of St. Catherine as given both by Simeon Metaphrastes
          and the Roman martyrology. According to these sources, St.
          Catharine was a maiden of royal birth (the daughter of King
          Konstos, in the Greek Officium), and of extraordinary wisdom and
          beauty. At the age of eighteen, she engaged in a controversy, at
          the command either of Maximinus or Maxentius (although the
          latter never ruled Alexandria), with fifty pagan philosophers,
          whom she converted so signally that they remained faithful to
          Christianity even to martyrdom. In prison, a few days before her
          own execution, she converted the empress, the general
          Porphyrius, and his 200 soldiers, all of whom suffered death by
          the sword for their faith. Resisting both the pleadings and the
          threats of the tyrant, Catharine remained unharmed by torture,
          even on a machine of sharp-pointed wheels, until she was finally
          beheaded by the command of Maximinus.

          The day of St. Catharine is celebrated either on Nov. 25 or on
          Mar. 5. Her body is said to have been borne by angels to Mount
          Sinai, where Justinian I. built a cloister in her honor and
          where her bones were said to have been discovered by Egyptian
          Christians in the eighth century, thus giving rise to the feast
          of the discovery of the body of St. Catharine on May 13 or 26.
          About 1027 Simeon, a monk from Sinai, is said to have carried a
          portion of the relics of St. Catharine to Rouen, and her
          monastery on Mount Sinai now retains only her head and one hand.
          [These are enclosed in a marble sarcophagus.] Inspired by the
          tradition of her victory over the philosophers of Alexandria,
          the philosophical faculty of the University of Paris later chose
          her as their patron saint. According to Occidental tradition,
          she is one of the fourteen "helpers in need," the only other
          feminine members of this band being SS. Barbara and Margaret.
          See [819]Helpers in Need.

          In Christian art, both of the East and the West, St. Catharine
          is an important figure. Her usual attributes are a sword and a
          wheel (either entire or broken), through which curved knives are
          thrust. To these are frequently added a palm of victory, a book
          in token of her learning, and occasionally a crown, or, more
          often, a bridal ring which the Christ-child himself is said to
          have placed on her finger in emblem of betrothal. The oldest
          Oriental picture of this saint is a mosaic over the apse of the
          basilica of the Transfiguration in the monastery on Sinai, which
          represents simply a female head without attributes. In a picture
          by Simon of Sienna (d. 1344) she bears in her hand a palm and a
          book. Among the numerous representations of St. Catherine in
          Western art, special mention may be made of the works of
          Altichiero da Zevio (c. 1380) in the frescos of the chapel of
          St. George at Padua, the frescos of Masaccio (c. 1420) in the
          upper church of St. Clement at Rome, eleven marble bas-reliefs
          (probably dating from the fourteenth century) in the church of
          Santa Chiara in Naples, nine pictures of 1385 in the cloister of
          St. Paul at Leipsic, and the miniatures in the Vie de Sainte
          Catherine d' Alexandrie by Jean Mielot, secretary of Philip the
          Good, duke of Burgundy (c. 1462). After the middle of the
          fifteenth century the most noteworthy artists of Italy,
          Flanders, and Germany, such as Fiesole, Raffael, Carlo Dolce,
          Jan van Eyck, Hans Memling, and Lukas Cranach, vied with one
          another in the production of pictures of St. Catharine, and the
          medieval Christian drama repeatedly represented the legend of
          the saint in mysteries, the earliest being that of the Norman
          Geoffrey, abbot of St. Albans, which was played at Dunstable
          about 1120.

   Catharine de' Ricci, Saint
          CATHARINE DE' RICCI, rît´chî, SAINT: Roman Catholic saint; b. at
          Florence [Apr. 23] 1522; d. at Prato (11 m. n.w. of Florence)
          Feb. 2 [1590]. She was educated in a convent at Monticelli and
          at the wish of her father lived in the world for a short time,
          after which she took the veil and entered the Dominican nunnery
          of St. Vincent at Prato. At the age of twenty-five she became
          prioress, and spiritual counsel was sought from her by bishops,
          cardinals, and princes. She was also a close friend of St.
          Philip Neri, with whom she maintained an active correspondence.
          The intensity of her meditation on the Passion was such that she
          actually felt the sufferings of Christ and frequently shed blood
          as if from scourgings and wounds. St. Catharine was canonized by
          Benedict XIV. in 1746 and her feast was appointed for Feb. 13.
          In art she has the attributes of the crown of thorns and a
          marriage ring. The elegant style of her letters ranks her as one
          of the best Italian classics of the second half of the sixteenth
          century [ed. A. Gherardi, Florence, 1890].

   Catharine, Saint, of Sienna
          CATHARINE, SAINT, OF SIENNA: Roman Catholic saint; b. at Sienna
          [Mar. 25] 1347; d. at Rome Apr. 29, 1380. She was the
          twenty-third child of a dyer named Jacomo Benincasa.

    Early Life.

          Her early home in the vicinity of a Dominican monastery made a
          deep impression on the sensitive child, and she believed that
          St. Dominic himself appeared to her in a dream and urged her to
          enter his order. Disregarding her mother's wish that she should
          marry, Catherine, then about twelve years of age, cut off her
          long blond hair to escape unwelcome attentions. Three years
          later smallpox destroyed her beauty and she was able to fulfil
          her heart's desire, to which her mother had consented sometime
          previously, by entering the order of penitents of St. Dominic.
          She no longer drank wine, while her only food was uncooked
          herbs, taken as a salad, or with oil, fruit, and bread. She
          scourged herself thrice daily according to the most rigid
          Dominican custom, once for herself, once for the living, and
          once for the dead. Under her habit she wore a shirt of haircloth
          for which she substituted later an iron chain about her waist.
          She passed the night in prayer until the bells on the monastery
          called to matins and then lay down between boards which
          symbolized her coffin. This asceticism she practised in a tiny
          room in her father's house which she scarcely left for three
          years except to attend mass in the neighboring Dominican church.
          After 1366, however, she appeared more frequently in public and
          became conspicuous for her deeds of mercy to the poor and sick,
          especially during the plague of 1374. Through her devotion and
          her piety she gathered around her a spiritual household of about
          twenty persons of both sexes, chiefly members of the Dominican
          order.

    Visions.

          The chief cause of St. Catharine's fame was her reputation for
          visions and for prophecy. Even during the time of her novitiate
          she believed that Christ often appeared to her and, toward the
          end of this period of preparation, that he himself betrothed her
          formally as he had the first St. Catharine (see [820]Catharine,
          Saint, the Martyr), by placing a ring upon her finger. This
          marriage symbol, she declared, was always visible to her,
          although no other eyes might see it. Her union with Christ was
          further sanctified by an interchange of hearts and finally by
          the divine stigmata, beginning with the print of a nail on her
          hand and ending with the painful impress of the four other
          wounds. This stigmatization also, as in the case of her German
          contemporary, [821]Margareta Ebner of Medingen, always remained
          invisible, whereas in St. Francis and the majority of the
          stigmatists, the wounds might be seen of all. She likewise
          believed that she associated much with the Virgin and with
          Christ, not only being convinced that she drank the blood from
          the wounded side of the Lord, and the milk from Mary's breast,
          but also that she received divine instruction, admonition, and
          comforts, which she was frequently able to communicate to others
          in her ecstasies. Many of her letters and writings, especially
          her "Dialogues," were dictated by her in trances. She once
          fasted during the forty days from Easter to Ascension, being
          supported solely by the Eucharist and thus becoming a model for
          later saints, particularly for the two Catharines of the
          fifteenth century.

    Political Activity.

          Despite her death to the world, St. Catharine was compelled,
          during the closing years of her life, to take part repeatedly in
          the political and ecclesiastical affairs of her country. After
          1374 she frequently left Sienna for the promotion of peace
          between the hostile nobles of Tuscany. In 1375 she was in Pisa,
          where she wrote Queen Joan of Naples to undertake a crusade to
          free the Holy Land. A year later she went to Avignon to
          reconcile the republic of Florence with Gregory XI., but was
          unsuccessful on account of the treachery of the Florentines.
          Later, however, after she had in great measure been instrumental
          in securing the return of the pope to Rome, she effected her
          purpose by a journey to Florence in 1378. The schism between
          Urban VI. in Italy and Clement VII. in Avignon also engaged her
          attention. She was a firm partizan of the former, who summoned
          her to Rome and after listening to her exhortations of peace
          sent her to the court of Joan together with St. Catharine of
          Sweden to win the queen from Clement to himself. The mission
          failed, since Bridget's daughter would not be subordinate to her
          sister saint, but Catherine of Sienna lived to see the
          longed-for, though brief, adherence of Naples to her pope. She
          was recalled to Rome by this turmoil and struggle and there
          died. She was buried in the Dominican Church of Minerva in Rome,
          although her skull is said to be in the Dominican Church of her
          native city. She was canonized by Pius II., in 1461, while Urban
          VIII. appointed her feast for Apr. 30. She is represented in art
          as carrying a crucifix with stigmata on her hands, as well as
          with the bridal ring. Occasionally she carries in her hand a
          lily or a book.

    Writings.

          The chief writings of St. Catharine of Sienna are 373 letters
          (best separate edition by N. Tommaseo, Le Lettere di Santa
          Caterina da Siena, 4 vols., Florence, 1860), many of them
          addressed to popes, cardinals, princes, and nobles, and
          important for the history of the period. She likewise wrote
          twenty-six prayers, various short prophetic oracles, and a
          dialogue between herself and God the Father, dictated in a
          trance in 1378, under the title Libro dells Divine Dottrina
          (Eng. transl., by A. Thorold, Dialogue of the Seraphic Virgin
          Catharine of Sienna, London, 1896), later divided by G. Gigli
          into four treatises on religious wisdom, prayer, providence, and
          obedience; an older division is into six treatises under the
          title Dialogi de providentia Dei. Historically, the most
          interesting of these treatises is the one on prayer, in which
          St. Catherine emphasizes the value of the prayer of the heart,
          which needs no words, in contradistinction to mere formalism. In
          her criticisms she spared neither priests, cardinals, nor pope,
          sternly reproving them for their derelictions and admonishing
          them of their high duty. Yet though she proclaimed the necessity
          of reformation, she desired it to be within the Church and was
          unswerving in her orthodoxy and in her allegiance to the Roman
          Catholic faith. Her complete works were first edited by Aldus at
          Venice in 1500, but the best of the older editions is that of G.
          Gigli, L'Opere della Serafica Santa Caterina da Siena (5 vols.,
          Sienna, 1707-26).

          CATHARINE, SAINT, OF SWEDEN: Roman Catholic saint; b. in Sweden
          1331 or 1332; d. at Vadstena (130 m. s.w. of Stockholm) Mar. 24,
          1381. She was the second daughter of St. Bridget, the founder of
          the Brigittines (see [822]Bridget, Saint, of Sweden). At the age
          of thirteen or fourteen she married a young nobleman of German
          extraction named Eggart of Kürnen--the marriage was, however, by
          mutual consent only nominal, and both parties preserved a
          lifelong virginity. During the lifetime of her husband,
          Catherine accompanied her mother on the last-named's first
          journey to Rome, where through a vision of St. Bridget she
          learned of her husband's death in Sweden. She then made a
          pilgrimage with her mother to the Holy Land, but was in Rome
          with her brother Birger when St. Bridget died there in 1373. She
          was one of those who escorted her mother's bones to Sweden, and
          she then took up her abode at Vadstena, the mother house of the
          Brigittines, where she ruled as the successor of St. Bridget.
          About the time of the return of the popes from Avignon, St.
          Catherine again resided for some years in Italy and twice
          secured papal confirmation of the rule of her order, first from
          Gregory XI. in 1377 and again from Urban VI. two years later.
          The day appointed for her feast in the Roman martyrology is Mar.
          22. In art her attribute is a hind. She wrote a "Consolation of
          the Soul," which has been lost. According to the preface, it was
          a compilation from many books and treated of the ten
          commandments, the seven benedictions, the seven joys of Mary,
          the seven gifts of the Holy Spirit, and the seven deadly sins.

   Catharinus, Ambrosius
          CATHARINUS, AMBROSIUS: The monastic name of Lancelotto Politi,
          Dominican, bishop of Minori and archbishop of Conza; b. in
          Sienna 1487; d. in Naples Nov. 8, 1553. In 1517 he entered in
          Florence the monastery of Savonarola, against whom he wrote a
          polemic treatise in 1548. Eager in opposing every form of
          heresy, he appeared against Luther in 1520 with an Apologia pro
          veritate catholicæ ac apostolicæ fidei. Luther replied in 1521
          (Ad librum A. Catharini responsio), and Catharinus answered.
          Then he went to France, and wrote in Paris against a member of
          his own order, Cardinal Cajetan, Annotationes in commentaria
          Cajetani. After returning to his country he wrote against his
          fellow townsman Bernardino Ochino, who in the mean while had
          fled from Italy to live according to his own belief (see
          [823]Ochino, Bernardino). A little later Catharinus issued two
          treatises against Italian Protestant works; viz., Trattato
          utilissimo del benefizio di Gesu Cristo crocifisso and Sommario
          della Sacra Scrittura. The polemic theologian was present at the
          Council of Trent. He arrived in 1545 with the legate Del Monte
          and made a speech at the third session. As a reward for his
          services Paul III. made him bishop of Minori in 1546. Julius
          III. made him archbishop of Conza in 1552, and was on the point
          of naming him cardinal when Catharinus died. The earliest of the
          works of Catharinus are collected in his Opuscula (Leyden,
          1542), but there is no complete edition.

   Cathcart, William
          CATHCART, WILLIAM: American Baptist; b. at Londonderry, Ireland,
          Nov. 8, 1826. He was educated at Glasgow University and Horton
          (now Rawdon) Baptist Theological College, Yorkshire, England,
          from which he was graduated in 1850. He was minister of a
          Baptist church at Barnsley, near Sheffield, from 1850 to 1853,
          when he went to the United States, and accepted a call to Mystic
          River, Conn., where he remained four years. He was then pastor
          of the Second Baptist Church, Philadelphia, from 1857 to 1884,
          and was also president of the American Baptist Historical
          Society from 1876 to 1884. He has written: The Papal System,
          from Its Origin to the Present Time (Philadelphia, 1872); The
          Baptists and the American Revolution (1876); and The Baptism of
          the Ages and of the Nations (1878), and edited The Baptist
          Encyclopædia (Philadelphia, 1881). Since 1884 he has held no
          regular charge, his health not permitting him to accept a
          pastorate, although he has been able to devote part of his time
          to literary labors.

   Cathedra
          CATHEDRA: The ancient Latin title for the special seat occupied
          by the bishop in Christian churches. Even in the catacombs such
          seats were used, either cut out of the solid rock or portable.
          In the basilicas the cathedra stood at the back of the
          semicircular apse, behind the altar, which was on the chord of
          the arc; but when it became customary to place the altar back
          against the wall, the bishop's seat was brought down into the
          choir and placed on the north or gospel side. The early Church
          preserved with great reverence the seats of its first bishops;
          thus it is learned from Eusebius (Hist. eccl., VII. xix. 32)
          that the church of Jerusalem preserved that of James, and the
          church of Alexandria that of Mark. A very ancient chair
          traditionally believed to be that of Peter is preserved in St.
          Peter's at Rome, and was used for many centuries for the
          enthronement of new popes, until Alexander VII. (1655-67), for
          its better preservation, had Bernini enclose it in a colossal
          bronze throne. At the celebration of the eighteenth centenary of
          the apostle's martyrdom in 1867, Plus IX. had it again exposed
          to view; an exact description and picture of it may be found in
          Kraus, Roma sotterranea, Freiburg, 1873. The bishop's seat was
          often used as a symbol of the teaching office of the Church,
          exercised through him; this is frequently referred to in the
          mosaics and carving of extant chairs dating from the fifth to
          the ninth century. Thus in the definition of the doctrine of
          papal infallibility, the pope is said to speak ex cathedra when
          he proclaims a doctrine "in the exercise of his office as pastor
          and teacher of all Christians."

   Cathedral
          CATHEDRAL: In the churches with episcopal organization, the
          principal church of a diocese, the especial seat of the bishop.
          It is the normal place for the principal episcopal functions,
          such as ordination, and is directly under the charge of the
          bishop, who is assisted in its administration and in the
          performance of divine service by a body of canons (see
          [824]Chapter), whose head is a dean or provost. In England, from
          the Reformation until 1840, a distinction was drawn between
          cathedrals of the old and of the new foundation. The former were
          those where the chapter had been always composed of secular
          canons, and whose constitution remained, therefore, unchanged;
          in the latter, after the suppression of the monasteries by Henry
          VIII., a new organization was required to replace the earlier
          monastic chapter. The older cathedrals, from their rank and
          importance in the history of the Church, offer some of the most
          splendid and imposing examples of Christian architecture. See
          [825]Architecture, Ecclesiastical.

   Catholic
          CATHOLIC (Gk. katholikos, "general, universal," from kath'
          holou, "on the whole"): The phrase he katholike ekklesia, "the
          catholic church," was first used by Christian writers to
          distinguish the entire body of believers from individual bodies.
          It then came naturally to designate the orthodox in distinction
          from heretics and schismatics. Later it was applied to faith,
          tradition, and doctrine; it was understood as expressing the
          universality of the Church ("in Greek that is called 'catholic'
          which is spread through all the world," Augustine, Epist., lii.
          1); it distinguished a cathedral from parish churches, or the
          latter from oratories or monastic chapels. After the separation
          between the Greek and Latin churches, the epithet "catholic" was
          assumed by the latter, as "orthodox" was by the former. At the
          Reformation it was claimed by the Church of Rome in opposition
          to the Protestant or Reformed churches; in England the theory
          was maintained that the national Church was the true catholic
          Church of the land, and the expression "Roman Catholic" came
          into use for the sake of distinction. "Anglo-Catholic" was
          coined by analogy with this at the time of the Tractarian
          movement. On the continent the single word "catholic" is the
          common designation for that branch of the Church in affiliation
          with Rome. By Protestants the term has generally been
          interpreted to mean the entire communion of the saved in all
          time and places. The word "catholic" in the phrase "the holy
          catholic Church" of the Apostles' Creed is explained by Pearson
          (Exposition of the Creed, art. ix.) as indicating that the
          Church is to be disseminated through all nations, extended to
          all places, and propagated to all ages; that it contains in it
          all truths necessary to be known, exacts absolute obedience from
          all men to the commands of Christ, and furnishes us with all
          graces necessary to make our persons acceptable and our actions
          well-pleasing in the sight of God. The word was not in the
          earliest form of the Creed.

   Catholic Apostolic Church
          CATHOLIC APOSTOLIC CHURCH: The outcome of a religious movement
          which began in Scotland in 1830, but took its full and
          distinctive form in 1835. Its adherents do not use the term "The
          Catholic Apostolic Church" as implying that they alone
          constitute the Church, but as affirming that they are members of
          it. It embraces all the baptized.

    Supernatural Utterances.

          In 1828 about fifty gentlemen, some clergymen and some laymen,
          but mostly of the Church of England, met at the country seat of
          [826]Henry Drummond at Albury, West Surrey, for the study of the
          prophetic Scriptures. The subjects considered were those
          connected with the return of the Lord and the present office of
          the Spirit in the Church. In Feb., 1830, some members of a
          Presbyterian family living near Glasgow began to speak in what
          were believed to be supernatural utterances. They affirmed that
          their organs of speech were used by the Spirit of God to express
          the divine mind and will. It is said by one who had intimate
          personal knowledge of those speaking that the subject of
          spiritual gifts had not at all occupied their attention; much
          less had they any thought or expectation of their revival. These
          utterances, both from the religious character of those speaking
          and from their own intrinsic nature, awakened great attention in
          all the region round; and having come to the knowledge of
          certain gentlemen in London, some of whom had attended the
          conferences at Albury, a deputation was sent up to Scotland in
          July to inquire into them, and ascertain whether the utterances
          were of the Spirit, or not. They returned fully convinced that
          the utterances were divine. In May, 1831, like utterances were
          heard in London, the first in a congregation of the Church of
          England. This being reported to the bishop, he forbade them in
          the future as interfering with the service. Their occurrence in
          several dissenting congregations brought forth similar
          prohibitions, and this led to the utterances being made chiefly
          in the church of [827]Edward Irving, he being a believer in
          their divine origin. But they were not confined to London. At
          Bristol and other places the same spiritual phenomena appeared.
          Of these utterances one of the earliest was, "Behold the
          Bridegroom cometh. Go ye out to meet him"; and another often
          repeated, "The body of Christ."

    Apostles Appointed.

          The meaning of this was for a long time not understood, but it
          was gradually made plain that the Lord could not return till due
          spiritual preparation had been made in the Church, and that this
          could be effected only through the Spirit working in all the
          ministries and ordinances appointed by God in it. It was also
          made known that it was his purpose to restore the ministry of
          apostles; and twelve men were designated as such by the Spirit
          speaking through prophets. The first was so designated in 1832;
          but it was not until 1835 that the number was completed, and in
          a solemn service they were separated to their work as an
          apostolic college. The names of the apostles were J. B. Cardale,
          H. Drummond, H. King-Church, S. Perceval, N. Armstrong, F. V.
          Woodhouse, H. Dalton, J. O. Tudor, T. Carlyle, F. Sitwell, W.
          Dow, and D. Mackenzie. The following account has been given of
          their antecedents by one who knew them personally:

          Classed by their religious position, eight of them were members
          of the Church of England; three of the Church of Scotland; and
          one of the Independents. Classed by their occupations and social
          positions, three were clergymen, three were members of the bar,
          three belonged to the gentry, two of them being members of
          Parliament; and of the remaining three, one was an artist, one a
          merchant, and one held the post of Keeper of the Tower. Some of
          them were of the highest standing socially and politically, some
          of them of great ability as scholars and theologians; and all of
          them men of unblemished character, soundness in the faith, and
          abundant seal in all Christian labors.

          To prepare them for their work two things were
          necessary--knowledge of the purpose of God in the Church, and of
          its present actual condition. Their separation was followed by a
          retirement to Albury that the Scriptures might be read with such
          light through prophecy as God might please to give. Later they
          visited the several countries of Christendom, which were divided
          among them, to seek for all that was good and true in doctrine
          and ritual. Another step was a work of testimony to the Church
          in general of the Lord's acts in the restoration of his
          ministries. In 1836 they delivered an address to the king of
          England and the privy councilors, and another later to the
          archbishops and bishops of the United Church of England and
          Ireland; and in 1837 a testimony addressed to the rulers in
          Church and State in Christian lands. So far as practicable,
          these testimonies were delivered by the apostles in person to
          the patriarchs, archbishops, bishops, emperors, kings, and
          sovereign princes to whom they were addressed.

    Doctrines.

          In these documents, as well as in the whole course of their
          apostolic labor, the apostles witnessed to such things as
          these:--That the Church is the company of the baptized, the body
          of Christ, and constituted by God in infinite wisdom that the
          Head in Heaven might manifest himself through it in word and
          act; that its constitution was permanent, having a fourfold
          ministry--apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors; that these
          ministries were adapted to the mental and spiritual
          constitutions of man; that all were needful that the Head might
          carry on his work and perfect his saints; that the Head only
          could appoint his ministers; that apostles chosen by him were
          his representatives, the bond of unity, having universal
          jurisdiction; that prophets speaking through the Holy Ghost were
          media of light from God to the apostles; that evangelists were
          to preach to those without the Church, bringing them to baptism,
          and then to transfer them to the pastor; that the pastoral
          ministry embraces bishops, priests, and deacons; that the
          retention by the Church of the pastoral ministry only points to
          its having departed in measure from the ways of the Lord, and
          that this departure ultimately leads to the apostasy and the man
          of sin spoken of by St. Paul. The adherents of this movement
          point to the apostolic congregations as the true credentials of
          apostles--their faith in the Scriptures, their order, their
          obedience, their worship, their calm and patient waiting for the
          Lord, their catholic spirit.

    Congregations and Worship.

          The gathering of these congregations was of necessity, not of
          choice, as otherwise the divine order in ministries and worship
          could not be manifested. Their relation to the members of the
          Church in general is thus defined: "We are not separatists nor
          schismatics. We are not gathered together and distinguished from
          others in any hostile or aggressive attitude. The Head is not
          erecting new altars, but rebuilding that which was decayed." The
          liturgy used was not a mere compilation from existing liturgies,
          but was based upon the Mosaic ritual, its spiritual antitype and
          fulfilment. In the worship the three great creeds of the Church,
          the Apostles', Nicene, and Athanasian, are used. In all
          congregations sufficiently large, daily worship is appointed at
          six A.M. and five P.M., the opening and closing hours of the
          day. The Eucharist is the chief forenoon service on every Lord's
          day, and at other times as appointed. The ministers of each
          fully organized local church are a chief pastor, or angel, or
          bishop, and under him priests and deacons. All members pay
          tithes of income as of obligation, and, as able, voluntary
          offerings.

          As no official statistics of the number of congregations have
          ever been published, it is impossible to say how many there may
          now be, but congregations are formed in most of the larger
          cities of Christendom. The death of the apostles made necessary
          some changes in the administration and worship, but the faith is
          apparently strong that the Lord will in some supernatural way
          speedily confirm the work already done, and will complete it.

          (Samuel J. Andrews.)

          This body repudiates the title "Irvingites," by which it is
          generally known (see [828]Irving, Edward). In the early days of
          the movement there was no little uncertainty as to the final
          arrangement of the offices and jealousy between the different
          ranks. In 1839 Cardale was recalled from his second mission
          abroad to compose the differences which had arisen on account of
          the claim of the elders, which was supported by the prophets, to
          a voice in the government of the church. The apostolate
          succeeded in suppressing this revolt, and to avoid any
          recurrence of it the full general council was not again
          convoked, and only revived in 1877 in the form of a conference
          of the seven angels of London under the presidency of the
          apostle. In the same crisis (1840) the principle was laid down
          that the purity of the prophets' doctrine must be attested by
          the apostles, and thus the superiority of the apostolic office
          vindicated. The same year marks the beginning of another
          important change. The apostles who had been traveling on the
          Continent had come there into contact with Roman Catholicism,
          and the result was a definite assimilation to its ways of the
          "Catholic Apostolic Church," as it was now officially called.
          All traces of Scotch Presbyterian or English non-conformist
          traditions were gradually eradicated. Altars were now erected
          separated from the body of the church by a rail at which the
          communicants knelt. The people were taught to regard the
          Eucharist as a sacrifice of praise and thanksgiving in which the
          elements, changed by the Holy Ghost into the body and blood of
          Christ, were offered to God in commemoration of his death. The
          same tendency appeared in the liturgy introduced in 1842 and
          drawn up mainly by Cardale, which went back to early forms,
          Eastern as well as Western. The eucharistic vestments were
          adopted practically as in the Roman Catholic Church; extreme
          unction was introduced in 1847; from 1850 the consecrated
          elements were reserved in a tabernacle and every morning and
          evening (on the analogy of the showbread) exposed, not as
          objects of adoration but to assure the people of the Lord's
          presence and abiding intercession. 1n 1852 the use of candles on
          the altar and incense was added, and in 1868 holy water. The
          most original ceremony is the "sealing," which was introduced in
          1847 on Cardale's motion; with reference to Rev. vii. 3 sqq. it
          was taught that those who were to be saved must be sealed in
          order to escape the great tribulation. This was to be done by
          the apostles with laying on of hands and unction; candidates
          must be at least twenty years old.

          The result of the discord which followed these innovations, of
          the defection of the apostle Mackenzie, and of the failure of
          prophecy to fix the exact date of the Lord's coming, all
          contributed to keep down the numbers of the body, which in 1851
          counted 4,018 members with thirty-two churches, a decline from
          the days of the first enthusiasm. But the movement had already
          spread to other countries. In 1835-36 it had gained a foothold
          in Geneva; in 1841 a propaganda had been undertaken in southern
          Germany by Caird (husband of Mary Campbell, one of the original
          claimants of the gift of tongues), and still more zealously in
          northern Germany by the apostle [829]Thomas Carlyle, who
          established public worship in Berlin in 1848. Outside of
          Holland, however, little progress was made in other countries.
          Doubts were awakened by the death of one apostle after another,
          and in 1860, at a meeting of the apostolic college at Albury the
          prophet Geyer called for the elevation of the evangelists Böhm
          and Caird to the apostolic office. These two then, and in 1870
          some others, were recognized as coadjutor apostles. Geyer was
          not satisfied, and in 1861, being in Königsberg with Woodhouse,
          proclaimed the call of a local evangelist Rogasatzki to the
          apostolate. The latter soon made his submission, but a schism
          ensued. In 1863 Geyer himself was called, and ten months later
          one Schwartz, especially for Holland; on the assumption that
          there must always be twelve apostles, there were six in Hamburg
          and three in Amsterdam by 1875. Woodhouse, the last English
          apostle, died in 1901. In the English body prophecy was allowed
          less and less importance, and Cardale's treatise Prophesying and
          the Ministry of the Prophet in the Christian Church (1868)
          practically gave it its death-blow.

          The accessible figures give the present number of churches in
          England as about eighty, and in the United Staten as ten, with
          1,491 communicants. Probably more numerous are the followers of
          the German and Dutch branch, which has increased in strength,
          though its separation from the English body has favored a
          tendency to fanatical extravagance and to the abandonment of the
          likeness to Roman Catholicism in externals. Apostles, prophets,
          and other functionaries appear in ordinary dress, and the altar
          is usually replaced by a common table. The element of adoration
          in public worship is less and less emphasized, while more stress
          is laid upon conversion by preaching and prophecy and the
          assembling of the faithful for the speedy coming of the Lord.
          The insistence on the number of twelve apostles which was the
          justification for the schism is now considered merely as the
          letter, the essential being the permanence of the office, so
          that in 1900 there were fourteen apostles ministering in this
          branch. Its principal seats are Brunswick, Hamburg, Berlin, and
          Königsberg. In recent years it has extended also to North and
          South America, and claims that with the help of a native
          missionary no less than 15,000 converts have been "sealed" in
          the island of Java. Its official organ is the Wächterstimmen aus
          Ephraim, published monthly by the apostle Fr. Krebs at Iserlohn,
          Westphalia, Prussia, containing reports of the journeys of the
          apostles and statistics of conversions.

   Catholic Emancipation
          CATHOLIC EMANCIPATION: The name given to the Act by which
          Parliament, on Apr. 13, 1829, finally removed the civil
          disabilities under which the, Roman Catholics of England and
          Ireland had labored ever since the reign of Elizabeth, when
          those who refused to take the oath of supremacy and conform to
          the Established Church were excluded from the House of Commons
          and from all political power. They suffered from a mass of
          accumulated disabilities, which, if the law had been strictly
          enforced, would have deprived them of their rights, not only as
          citizens, but as parents, proprietors, and men. With the growth
          of toleration, a bill abolishing some of these disabilities was
          passed in 1778, to be followed by the uprising of the London mob
          known as the "Gordon Riots." Pitt had intended that the union
          between England and Ireland should be followed by a measure
          admitting Catholics to Parliament, with a provision for their
          clergy and a commutation of tithes. This hope, informally held
          out, probably helped to win their support for the union; but
          George III. was inflexibly opposed to this measure of justice,
          and Pitt resigned in consequence of its failure. In 1821, with
          Canning for its eloquent champion, a measure of emancipation was
          carried through the House of Commons, only to be defeated by
          Lord Eldon in the upper house. But a mighty agitation followed
          in Ireland, led by Daniel O'Connell and fomented by a great
          Catholic Association. This body was dissolved when Canning
          became minister in 1825, but revived when he was replaced by the
          anti-Catholic ministry of Wellington and Peel, and soon showed
          such formidable strength that the great Duke, with his political
          insight, saw that the hour for concession had come. The bill
          which Peel introduced threw open to Catholics Parliament and all
          the great offices of state, except those of regent, lord
          lieutenant of Ireland, and chancellor, the crown remaining
          limited, by an Act of Settlement to the Protestant Concession,
          and gave the electoral franchise to English Catholics. As the
          removal of an unjust anachronism, this measure was inevitable;
          but it failed to restore tranquillity to Ireland, since the
          concession had been robbed of its grace by delay and
          enforcement, and since the chief cause of Irish disaffection
          was, after all, not the religious disabilities but the tenure of
          land, as the sequel clearly showed.

   Catholic Epistles
          CATHOLIC EPISTLES: A name given to seven of the epistles of the
          New Testament; viz., James, I and II Peter, I, II, and III John,
          and Jude. Different explanations have been given of the
          significance of the name. (1) It has reference to the writers,
          who were the apostles in general, whereas the other New
          Testament epistles were believed to be written by Paul. (2) It
          refers to the contents, which do not treat of any particular
          topic, but are general. (3) It refers to the recipients, the
          letters not being addressed to a particular church, but to the
          Church universal. (4) It refers to opinion concerning these
          writings and indicates that they were generally accepted as
          authentic, in distinction from the many writings current and
          ascribed to apostolic authorship but not everywhere so received.
          The name was given to the First Epistle of John in the East
          about the second century, and by the fourth century it included
          the seven epistles named. In the West they were called
          "canonical" epistles. Certain non-canonical writings (as the
          Epistle of Barnabas and the letter from the apostles at
          Jerusalem in Acts xv. 23-29) are also called "catholic" by early
          writers. See [830]Canon of Scripture, II., 2, § 5.

   Catholicus
          CATHOLICUS: In the time of Constantine, a civil officer
          established after the organization of dioceses, each diocese
          having its catholicus, or receiver-general. As an ecclesiastical
          officer occurring in several Eastern churches, the catholicus
          occupied a position between the metropolitan and the patriarch.
          The title is also applied to the head of an independent or
          schismatic communion, such as the Armenian Church.

   Cave, William
          CAVE, WILLIAM: Church of England patristic scholar; b. at
          Pickwell (13 m. e. by n. of Leicester) Dec. 30, 1637; d. at
          Windsor Aug. 4, 1713. He studied at Cambridge, in St. John's
          College, and was made M.A. in 1660, D.D. in 1672, in 1681 D.D.
          by Oxford. He was vicar of Islington, now part of London,
          1662-91; rector of All Hallows the Great, Thames Street, London,
          1679-89; became chaplain of Charles II. and canon of Windsor in
          1681; and in 1690 vicar of Isleworth, London. His reputation
          rests on his eminent attainments in patristics. His principal
          works are: (1) Primitive Christianity (London, 1672; reprinted,
          Oxford, 1840, in connection with his Dissertation Concerning the
          Government of the Ancient Church by Bishops, Metropolitans, and

          Sept. 27, 1836. He was ordained priest in 1859, and, after
          teaching for several years, went to Rome, where he studied canon
          law. In 1872 he became a member of the Congregation of the
          Council, and twelve years later was consecrated titular
          archbishop of Amida and appointed apostolic delegate to Peru,
          Bolivia, and Ecuador, where he remained until 1889. In the
          latter year he was appointed secretary of the council, with the
          title of archbishop of Nazianzum, and in 1903 was created
          cardinal priest of Santa Maria in Ara Coeli. He is a member of
          the Congregations of Bishops and Regulars, the Council, the
          Propaganda for the Oriental Rite, the Index, and Indulgences.

   Cayet (Cahier, Caiet, Cajetanus), Pierre Victor Palma

          Roman Catholic convert; b. at Montrichard (18 m. s.s.w. of
          Blois), Touraine, 1525; d. in Paris May 10 (or July 22), 1610.
          He studied at Paris and Geneva, was Protestant pastor at
          Poitiers and in its neighborhood, and in 1584 became chaplain to
          Catherine of Bourbon, sister of Henry IV.; in 1595 he embraced
          Romanism, was made professor of Hebrew in the Sorbonne in 1596,
          and became priest in 1600. He was accused of scandalous writings
          and immorality, but claimed that all charges were prompted by
          ill will because of his change of faith. His most noteworthy
          writings were Chronologie septénaire de l'histoire de la paix
          entre le roi de France et d'Espagne (Paris, 1605) and
          Chronologie novénaire sous le règne de Henri IV (1608).

   Cazalla, Augustino
          CAZALLA, c??-th??l´y??, AUGUSTINO: Spanish Protestant; b. at
          Valladolid 1510; executed by the Inquisition there May 21, 1559.
          He was a scholar of [834]Bartholomé Carranza and studied at
          Valladolid and Alcala. The influence of his father, the chief
          officer of the royal finances, opened to him a brilliant career
          in the Church, and his own ability won him the reputation of
          being one of the foremost preachers in Spain. In 1545 he became
          chaplain and almoner to Charles V. and accompanied the emperor
          to Germany on the outbreak of the Schmalkald war. There he
          undertook to confute the Lutherans, but ended by accepting their
          doctrines. Returning to Spain in 1552, he was cautious at first
          in expressing his opinions, but ultimately his mother's house in
          Valladolid became the meeting-place of the Protestants of the
          city and Cazalla himself the head of the congregation. In 1558,
          with his brothers and sisters and about seventy-five others, he
          was put into prison. On Mar. 4, 1559, when threatened with
          torture, he acknowledged that he had accepted Luther's
          teachings, but denied that he had taught them to others except
          to those already of like mind; further concessions he
          steadfastly refused to make. The auto da fé at which he perished
          was the first of these sad spectacles. Sixteen persons,
          including a brother and a sister of Cazalla, brought to judgment
          at the same time, were condemned to imprisonment for life; two,
          Cazalla's brother Francisco and Antonio Herezuelo, a lawyer of
          Toro, were burned alive; and twelve others, including Cazalla,
          were strangled before being burned. At the place of execution he
          was persuaded to address his fellow prisoners.

          spent some years at the monastery of Rathmelsige (Melfont, near
          Drogheda?) in Ireland. His oldest brother, [835]Cedd, chose him
          to succeed himself as abbot at Lastingham, Northumbria, in 664.
          After the [836]Synod of Whitby Wilfrid was elected to the
          Northumbrian bishopric and went to Gaul to be consecrated. As he
          did not return immediately King Oswy saw fit to appoint Ceadda,
          and he was consecrated (665?) by Wine of Winchester and two
          British bishops. Wilfrid acquiesced on going back to England,
          but when Theodore became archbishop of Canterbury (669)
          objection was raised to Ceadda's consecration; he expressed his
          willingness to lay down an office of which he had never deemed
          himself worthy, retired to his monastery in Northumbria, and
          Wilfrid was instated in his place. Theodore, however, impressed
          by Ceadda's humility and worth, reconsecrated him as bishop of
          the Mercians to succeed Jaruman, and he fixed his residence at
          Lichfield (Sept., 669). His simplicity, piety, and devotion to
          duty won the hearts of all, and in later times he was one of the
          most popular of English saints.

   Cecil, Richard
          CECIL, RICHARD: English "evangelical"; b. in London Nov. 8,
          1748; d. at Hampstead (London) Aug. 15, 1810. His early life was
          profligate, but he was converted about 1772, and in 1?73 entered
          Queen's College, Oxford (B.A., 1777); he was ordained priest
          1777 and, after holding various livings, was appointed minister
          of St. John's Chapel, Bedford Row, London, in 1780. He was the
          leading "evangelical" clergyman of his time, and exerted a wide
          influence. He had an original mind, dignified carriage, and
          impressive delivery. His works were collected and published with
          memoir by the Rev. J. Pratt (4 vols., London, 1811; new ed.,
          with his letters and memoir by Mrs. Cecil, 1854). Perhaps the
          most noteworthy of his works is The Remains of Richard Cecil,
          with numerous selections from his works, new ed., with
          introduction by his daughter and preface by R. Bickersteth
          (London, 1876), containing reminiscences of his conversations.

   Cecilia, Saint
          CECILIA, SAINT: Roman maiden of noble family, who is said by
          different versions of the uncertain and contradictory tradition
          to have suffered martyrdom under Marcus Aurelius and Commodus,
          under Alexander Severus, and under Diocletian. Her Acta relate
          that on the eve of her marriage she converted her husband,
          Valerianus, to Christianity. Angels appeared to both Cecilia and
          Valerianus charging them that her virginity should not be
          impaired. Tibertius, the brother of Valerianus, was then
          converted. The two brothers, refusing to sacrifice to the gods
          at the bidding of the prefect, Almachius were executed by the
          sword, and Cecilia was exposed to death in an overheated bath in
          her own house; when this means failed she too was beheaded. The
          remains of the three martyrs were placed in the catacombs of St.
          Calixtus, when Pope Paschal I., in 821, is said to have removed
          the relics of Cecilia to a church called after her name (Sta.
          Cecilia in Trastevere); her coffin of cypress wood was found
          there in 1599 (Baronius, Annales, ad an. 821). De Rossi
          discovered what is probably the original crypt of Cecilia,
          adjoining the papal crypt in the cemetery of Calixtus, and has
          attempted to prove that she belonged to the old patrician family
          of the Cæcilii; also that the date of her martyrdom was 177
          under Marcus Aurelius. Toward the end of the Middle Ages Cecilia
          begins to be represented in art with musical attributes. The
          conception of her as patroness of the organ dates probably from
          Raffael's painting of 1513, now in Bologna, and may be based
          upon a misunderstanding of certain words of her Acta which refer
          to the (secular) musical instruments at her wedding, but were
          thought to indicate a particular instrument played by herself.
          The rôle which she fills among both Roman Catholics and
          Protestants as patroness of church music in general may be due
          to the founding of a musical academy at Rome by Gregory XIII. in
          1584 under her protection and named after her.

          CEDD (CEDDA), ST.: Bishop of Essex; d, at Lastingham (25 m.
          n.n.e. of York), Northumbria, Oct. 26, 664. With his youngest
          brother [837]Ceadda or Chad, he was brought up at Lindisfarne,
          and was sent in 653 by his abbot, [838]Finan, and Oswy, king of
          Northumbria, as missionary, first to Peada, king of Mercia, and
          then to Sigbert, king of Essex. He was very successful and was
          consecrated bishop of the East Saxons by Finan and two Scotch
          bishops in 854. He founded two monasteries in Essex and the one
          at Lastingham and governed them strictly, according to the
          Columban rules. He was present at the [839]Synod of Whitby in
          664 and acted as interpreter; he inclined to the British side,
          but when the Roman prevailed he acquiesced. He died of the
          plague while on a visit to Northumbria. He has been called the
          second bishop of London, but Bede, who is the source of all
          information concerning him (Hist. eccl., iii. 21-23, 25, 26, 28;
          iv. 3), never speaks of him as such.

          Bar-le-duc May 14,1688; d, at Flavigny, near Nancy, Nov. 17,
          1761. He entered the Congregation of St. Vannes (reformed
          Benedictines) in 1705, and became titular prior of Flavigny. His
          great work was an Histoire générale des auteurs sacrés et
          ecclésiastiques, qui contient leur vie, le catalogue, la
          critique, le judgement, la chronologie, l'analyse, et le

          vols., 1782, new ed., 16 vols., 1858-69). This work is brought
          down to the middle of the thirteenth century, and is more
          complete and exact than the similar undertaking of [840]Du Pin,
          but is inferior in respect to style and critical judgment; it is
          of most value for the first six centuries, for which Ceillier
          was able to use Tillemont and the Benedictine editions.

   Cele, Johannes
          CELE, JOHANNES: Teacher at Zwolle; b. at Zwolle, about the
          middle of the fourteenth century; d. there May 9, 1417. He
          received his early education in his native place, continued his
          studies in some unknown school, and, returning to Zwolle, in
          1374 was entrusted with the school-management there. Having been
          awakened by the preaching of Gerard Groote, he thought of
          joining the order of Minorites, but was prevented from doing so
          by Groote, who advised him to complete his studies at Prague.
          Whether he went to Prague is not known. Depressed in mind, Cele
          spent some time in the monastery at Munnikhuizen and in company
          with Ruysbroeck. Through the influence of Groote, in spite of
          opposition, Cele was made rector of the school at Zwolle. He
          received much help from the Brethren of the Common Life and
          assisted them especially in the difficult task of securing
          houses at Zwolle for their adherents and those committed to
          their charge, but he did not join the brotherhood, remaining
          rector of the ever-growing school, which numbered 1,000 pupils.
          He taught Latin, grammar, and rhetoric, and expounded the
          Scriptures, admitting laymen to his lectures against the will of
          the city ministers. He founded a large library by buying and
          copying manuscripts. For more than forty years he stood at the
          head of the institution, highly esteemed for his learning and
          piety and his lasting influence on his pupils. The lazy and
          presumptuous were kept under rigid discipline. All wore the
          simple dress of the brethren. He had no method of his own, but
          labored in the spirit of his friend Groote, recognizing in a
          pious personality the source of all morality, and thus he gave
          to the growing humanism the right direction and true basis in
          the Christian faith and genuine piety. Many prominent men were
          his pupils, such as Heinrich von Herxen, Wessel Gansfort,
          Alexander Hegius, Rudolf Langen, Rudolf Agricola, Ludwig
          Dringenberg, Moritz von Spiegelberg, and Johannes Busch.

   Celestine
          CELESTINE: The name of five popes.

          Celestine I: Pope 422-432. He was a Roman by birth, and only a
          deacon when, in Sept., 422, he was raised to the episcopate. The
          main endeavor of his pontificate was to extend the jurisdiction
          of his see. To this end he made use of a conflict which had been
          going on for years in the African Church in order to assert the
          right of the Roman pontiff to receive appeals thence. He
          restored to communion Apiarius, an African priest who had been
          deposed by his bishop and had appealed to Rome under Zosimus and
          Boniface I. The Africans, however, in a synod at Carthage in 424
          or 425, denied his right to interfere. Celestine's part in the
          dogmatic controversies of his time was also influenced by
          political considerations (see [842]Semi-Pelagianism;
          [843]Nestorius). He died at the end of July, 432.

          enough to fulfil the hopes which his elevation had raised.

          Celestine III. (Jacinto Bobo): Pope 1191-98. After being a
          cardinal forty-seven years, at eighty-five he was elected, Mar.
          30 (?), 1191, the first pope of the house of Orsini. The times
          were troublous (see [844]Clement III.), and the aged pope, a man
          of mild temper and inclined to half measures, was no match for
          his formidable opponent Henry VI., who appeared before Rome and
          demanded his coronation, which Celestine was obliged to perform
          on the day after Easter. Henry surrendered Tusculum to him, but
          later forced him, in compliance with the agreement of May 31,
          1188, to give it up to the Romans for destruction. From 1194 he
          saw the Norman kingdom, with which his predecessors had invested
          Tancred, in the possession of the hated Hohenstaufen. Henry
          refused to take the oath of fealty or to pay tribute; he
          appointed bishops and judged them, and gave the lands of
          Countess Matilda to his brother Philip in fee. Celestine did not
          venture to excommunicate him, but did break off relations with
          him, though he offered reconciliation when Henry took the cross
          (May 31, 1195). It soon became evident that Henry was a crusader
          only for political advantage, and the territory and rights of
          the Church were invaded in various quarters. Humiliations beset
          the aged pope. He was obliged to release Philip Augustus of
          France from his unperformed vow to free the Holy Sepulcher; and
          could not force the recognition of his legate in England,
          William of Longchamp (the bishop of Ely, Richard Coeur de Lion's
          chancellor), by Prince John and the barons; nor did Philip
          Augustus heed his admonitions against the arbitrary dissolution
          of his marriage with Ingeborg of Denmark and the contracting of
          a new one. His fear of the emperor prevented him from protesting
          against Richard's imprisonment; only after the English king had
          paid his ransom did he excommunicate Leopold of Austria.
          Celestine survived Henry VI. by only a few months, dying Jan. 8,
          1198.

          Bibliography: Bower, Popes, ii. 559-560.

          Celestine V. (Pietro di Murrhone): Pope 1294. He was born about
          1215 in the Abruzzi; d. at Fumone, near Anagni, May 19, 1296. At
          twenty he entered the Benedictine order, and lived for years in
          retirement first on the Murrhone, then on the Majella, where
          numerous followers gathered around him (see [845]Celestines).
          After the death of Nicholas IV. (Apr. 4, 1292), dissensions
          among the cardinals hindered an election, until in March, 1294,
          Charles II. of Naples, who needed a pope to support his designs
          on Sicily, took up the matter. Since there was no hope of
          agreeing on a cardinal, Latinos, the head of the Angevin party
          in the sacred college, drew his attention to the hermit of the
          Abruzzi, whose sanctity was universally revered; and Pietro was
          elected on July 5. His unfitness for high affairs of state was
          equally well known; the various leaders hoped to rule through
          him. But the remarkable choice can only be fully explained by a
          study of the mystical reform movement represented by
          [846]Joachim of Fiore, which had spread so widely among a
          section of the Franciscan order. Their prominent men favored the
          election of Pietro enthusiastically, flocked to his coronation,
          and renewed their old relations with him by a formal embassy.
          The new pope sanctioned their observance of the rule of the
          order in its strictest form, and took them under his special
          protection, allowing them to be known by the name which he had
          assumed as pope. Meantime Charles was preparing to use his
          candidate for his own purposes; he surrounded him with Sicilian
          counselors, and brought him to Aquila, where he had him crowned
          in the presence of only three cardinals. The king's influence,
          however, finally induced the others to appear one by one, the
          last being Benedetto Gaetani, Celestine's successor as Boniface
          VIII., and the coronation ceremony was repeated. Celestine's
          whole interest was given to the promotion of monasticism; in
          other things he was merely a tool in the heads of Charles, who
          got him to create twelve Angevin cardinals, confirm his treaty
          with Aragon, and supply large sums of money for the Sicilian
          war. The strict regulation of Gregory X. for the conclave was
          reenacted, that Charles might have the next election also
          securely in his hands, and in October the curia was removed to
          Naples. Both the cardinals and the pope were discontented with
          the state of affairs, and the latter began to think of
          abdication, that he might be able to give himself once more
          wholly to his ascetic practises. The thing was without
          precedent, and offered great constitutional difficulties, which,
          when Celestine's resolve was seen to be fixed, were as far as
          possible removed by the legal wisdom of Gastani, and the
          abdication took place on Dec. 13. While Dante speaks scornfully
          of the pope "who made the great refusal," others lauded the act
          highly--Petrarch among them, who regarded it as an example of
          humility entitling the poor hermit to rank above the apostles
          and many other saints. Gaetani was later accused of having
          brought about the abdication by guile in order to secure his own
          advancement. The charge is not justified, but he undoubtedly had
          his eye on the tiara in view. After he had attained it, he
          wished to keep his predecessor with him in Rome, lest he should
          be used as a tool by the opposition; but the ascetic fled, and
          was finally taken and imprisoned in the mountain castle of
          Fumone, where he died the next year. He was canonized by Clement
          V.

   Celestines
          CELESTINES: A name borne by two monastic societies which owe
          their origin to [847]Pope Celestine V. (1) The Benedictine
          Celestines, known also as Moronites and Murrhonites, were
          originally composed of men who were members of the Benedictine
          order, but lived as hermits on Monte Majella in the Abruzzi from
          about 1258, under the guidance of the future pope Celestine, who
          gave them a severer rule and obtained papal confirmation for the
          congregation from Urban IV., probably in 1264, though the
          alleged bull of this year, as well as another of Gregory X. from
          1274, is of doubtful genuineness. The early history of the
          congregation is, in fact, frequently open to critical objection;
          as, for example, the statement that it already had sixteen
          houses in 1274, when its founder is said to have gone to the
          general council at Lyons and attracted great attention as a
          wonder-worker. After about 1290, the mother house seems to have
          been at Monte Murrhone near Sulmona. On the founder's elevation
          to the papacy in 1294, he attempted by rich grants of
          indulgences and other privileges to give it a commanding
          position in the Benedictine monastic family; indeed, he aspired
          to reform the mother house of the whole order at Monte Cassino
          on the principles of his congregation. But the brevity of his
          pontificate prevented the execution of his plans. The
          congregation, however, continued to grow, until in Italy it had
          at the beginning of the eighteenth century ninety-six houses.
          Its rule, which in some points, especially as to fasting,
          surpasses the original Benedictine rule in strictness, was
          revised by Urban VIII. in 1629. The French province never got
          beyond twenty-one houses. In Bohemia and Lusatia the
          congregation had some famous seats, as at Prague, K?nigstein,
          and Oybin near Zittau, the last of which was founded by Charles
          IV. in 1366 and suppressed in the sixteenth century.--(2) The
          Franciscan Celestines (Poveri eremiti di Celestino), called also
          Fraticelli, were a congregation within the Franciscan order,
          founded in 1294, on an impulse given by Celestine V., by two of
          the "spiritual" sections of the order, Pietro da Macerato
          (Liberato) and Pietro da Fossombrone (Angelo Claremo, d. 1357).
          It existed down to about 1340 in nearly all its original
          strength as a congregation of the Minorites. See [848]Francis,
          Saint, of Assisi, and the Franciscan Order.

    1. Celibacy in the Early Church.

          Celibacy, in the Roman Catholic Church, means the permanently
          unmarried state to which men and women bind themselves either by
          a vow or by the reception of the major orders which implies
          personal purity in thought and deed. The Jewish priests and high
          priests were married, being restricted only in the choice of a
          wife (Lev. xxi. 7, 8, 14, 15). In preparation for the exercise
          of their office, they were to abstain from commerce with their
          wives, which was also required of the whole people before the
          reception of the Law on Sinai (Ex. xix. 15). The New Testament
          contains no prohibition of marriage; some of the apostles were
          married (Matt. viii. 14; I Cor. ix. 5), and Paul recommended
          marriage to the heads of churches (I Tim. iii. 1), though he
          considered that under some circumstances it was better not to
          marry (I Cor. vii. 38). Very early in the history of the Church
          the idea grew up that the unmarried state was preferable
          (Hermas, I. ii. 3; Ignatius to Polycarp, v.), and grew into a
          positive contempt of marriage (Origen, Hom. vi. in Num.; Jerome,
          Ad Jovinianum, i. 4). As early as the second century examples of
          voluntary vows of virginity are found, and the requirement of
          continence before the performance of sacred functions. By the
          fourth century canons began to be passed in that sense (Synod of
          Neocæsarea, 314 A.D., canon i.; Synod of Ancyra, 314 A.D., canon
          x.).

    2. Marriage of the Clergy Still Permitted.

          Unmarried men were preferred for ecclesiastical offices, though
          marriage was still not forbidden; in act, the clergy were
          expressly prohibited from deserting a lawfully married wife on
          religious grounds (Apostolic Canons, v.). The Synod of Gangra
          (355?) anathematized in its fourth canon, against the
          Eustathians, those who refused to accept the ministrations of a
          married priest. The stricter view prevailed so far, however,
          that the Council of Nicæa could speak of it as an ancient custom
          that priests and deacons should not marry after ordination,
          unless, in the case of deacons, they had expressed an intention
          of marrying at the time of their ordination--though both were
          allowed to retain wives already married, and a marriage
          contracted in contravention of this regulation was valid.

    3. In the Early Roman Catholic Church.

          The standpoint of the Roman Church was different from this. Thus
          Pope Siricius declared in 385 that priestly marriage had been
          allowed in the Old Testament because the priests could only be
          taken from the tribe of Levi; but that with the abandonment of
          that limitation this permission had lost its force, and that
          "obscoenæ cupiditates" (i.e., marriage) hindered the proper
          performance of spiritual functions. Succeeding popes adhered to
          this view (cf. decretals of Innocent I., 404, 405, and Leo I.,
          456, 458), and the rest of the Western Church came to it (Synods
          of Carthage, 390, 401). Candidates for the higher orders were
          accordingly required to take a vow of celibacy, and from the
          fifth century those for the subdiaconate also. A breach of this
          vow entailed degradation from office, but not the nullity of the
          marriage. Those in minor orders were still permitted to marry,
          but not a widow or for the second time (Fifth Synod of Carthage,
          401; Gregory I., 601). Secular legislation confirmed these
          regulations in so far as it forbade married men, or men who had
          children, to be made bishops, and even went further by declaring
          the marriages of those in major orders void and their children
          illegitimate. The Eastern Church adhered to the older
          legislation, with the modifications introduced by the imperial
          decrees just referred to; prohibited marriages were now declared
          void, but married men could still be admitted to orders without
          giving up their wives, except in the case of bishops (Council of
          Constantinople, 692). This system the modern Roman Catholic
          Church still allows for the Uniat Greeks, as explained by
          Benedict XIV. in the constitutions Etsi pastoralis (May 26,
          1742) and Eo quamvis tempore (May 4, 1745). But within its own
          boundaries the Latin Church has held more and more strictly to
          the requirement of celibacy, though not without continual
          opposition on the part of the clergy.

    4. The Medieval Period.

          The large number of canons on this subject enacted from the
          eighth century on shows that their enforcement was not easy.
          After the middle of the eleventh century the new ascetic
          tendency whose champion was Gregory VII. had a strong influence
          in this matter. Even before Hildebrand's accession to the
          papacy, the legislation of Leo IX. (1054), Stephen IX. (1058),
          Nicholas II. (1059), and Alexander II. (1063) had laid down the
          principles which as pope he was to carry out. In the synod of
          1074 he renewed the definite enactment of 1059 and 1063,
          according to which both the married priest who said mass and the
          layman who received communion at his hands were excommunicate.
          Urban II. decreed in 1089 that the marriage of one in major
          orders should be punished by the loss of both office and
          benefice. The Councils of Reims (1119) and of the Lateran (1123)
          ordered that the parties to such a marriage should be separated
          and sent to places of penance. The Lateran Council of 1139
          confirmed this provision, with the declaration "that such
          connection was not marriage." These strict principles were not
          extended to the minor orders. It is true that Alexander III. and
          Innocent III. prescribed the loss of clerical rank and
          privileges for even the holders of these in case they married;
          but Boniface VIII. (1298) and Clement V. (1311) reasserted the
          older law.

    5. The Council of Trent on Celibacy.

          After the Reformation had done its work, Charles V. endeavored
          by the Interim of 1548 to bring about the abolition of these
          rules, and with several other princes requested the discussion
          of the question at the Council of Trent. The council, however,
          maintained the system as a whole, and the following rules are
          now in force: (1) through the reception of major orders or the
          taking of monastic or other solemn vows, celibacy becomes so
          binding a duty that any subsequent marriage is null and void.
          (2) Any one in minor orders who marries loses his office and the
          right to go on to major orders, but the marriage is valid. (3)
          Persons already married may receive the minor orders if they
          have the intention of proceeding to the major, and show this by
          taking a vow of perpetual abstinence; but the promotion to the
          higher orders can only take place when the wife expresses her
          willingness to go into a convent and take the veil. The Council
          of Trent further lays down that the functions of the minor
          orders may be performed by married men in default of
          unmarried--though not by those who are living with a second
          wife. In the nineteenth century attempts were not lacking, even
          within the Roman Catholic Church, to bring about the abolition
          of celibacy. They were rather hindered than helped by temporal
          governments, and always firmly rejected by Rome.

    6. Protestant Rejection of Celibacy.

          Celibacy has been abolished among the Old Catholics; and modern
          legislation in Germany, France, Belgium, Italy, and Switzerland
          authorizes the marriage both of priests and of those who have
          taken a solemn vow of chastity. Austria, Spain, and Portugal
          still forbid it. The evangelical churches at the very outset
          released their clergy from the obligation of celibacy,
          professing to find no validity in the arguments adduced in its
          favor on the Roman side. The question is carefully discussed and
          decided against the Roman practise in the Augsburg Confession
          (xxiii.) and the Apology (vi.). Similar ground is taken in Art.
          xxxvii. of the first Helvetic Confession and Art. xxix. of the
          second, as well as in Art. xxxii. of the Thirty-nine Articles.
          Likewise disapproval is expressed of binding vows of celibacy in
          the Augsburg Confession (xxvii.) and Apology (xi.).

   Cell
          CELL: Usually the room or hut in which a monk, nun, hermit, or
          friar lives, but also a dependency of a large monastery, ruled
          by a prior, dean, or abbot, who was the virtual choice of the
          abbot of the mother house. Such "cells" were frequently country
          houses which with the grounds were bestowed upon the abbey as a
          source of revenue, as the monks living therein had to pay a
          certain part of their revenue to the mother house. Sometimes the
          "cell" was an important building, as Tynemouth Priory near
          Newcastle, England, which was a "cell" of the Benedictine abbey
          of St. Albans (20 m. n. of London); or Bermondsey, which was a
          "cell" of the Cluniac abbey of La Charité (140 m. s. of Paris).
          Originally a "cell" was an oratory erected over the grave of a
          martyr or saint.

   Celsus
          CELSUS: A pagan philosopher and controversialist against
          Christianity.

    Origen's Contra Celsum.

          In the period of peace which the Church enjoyed under the
          emperor Philip in the year 248, Origen brought to notice, by an
          exhaustive reply (the Contra Celsum), a treatise written about
          seventy years earlier against Christianity by a highly educated
          Platonist. The occasion of this reply may have been the
          celebration in that year of the thousandth anniversary of the
          founding of Rome, which gave the Christians reason to fear
          religious excitement on the part of the pagan population. Origen
          gives the arguments of Celsus sometimes word for word, sometimes
          in substance; in the latter case there is little abbreviation
          and not many omissions, so that there is very fair material for
          an attempt to reconstruct the original text of Celsus. This
          attempt was first made, not very systematically or successfully,
          by Jachmann in 1836; in 1873 Keim undertook a restoration of
          Celsus in a German version which, in spite of its defects, has
          many merits, and this was partially improved on in the French
          version of Aubé in 1878. The recent reconstruction by Neumann in
          the Greek shows that not more than one-tenth of the original has
          been lost, and that three-fourths of what we have is
          word-for-word quotation.

    The "True Discourse" of Celsus.

          The "True Discourse" of Celsus was composed in the last years of
          Marcus Aurelius. It notices the rescript of that emperor, issued
          in 177 (or 176 at the earliest), against popular tumults caused
          by the introduction of a new religion (viii, 69). In viii. 71
          the author speaks of two emperors reigning at the time, which
          fixes the date in the joint rule of Marcus Aurelius and
          Commodus, from 177 to 180. He was thus at least a contemporary
          of the Celsus to whom Lucian dedicated his "Alexander," and some
          have supposed the two to be identical. Lucian's friend, however,
          was an Epicurean, while our Celsus, in spite of Origen, stands
          out clearly as a Platonist; and the books kata magon (Lucian,
          Alex., lxi.; Origen, i. 68, kata mageias do not seem to fit in
          with the conception and tone of the "True Discourse." The
          latter, though usually divided into eight books, seems to have
          been but one originally; and, according to Origen (viii. 76),
          Celsus intended to write another, "in which he engaged to supply
          practical rules of living to those who felt disposed to embrace
          his opinions." In iv. 36 Origen mentions two more books written
          by a Celsus whose identity with ours he leaves uncertain; but as
          he seems to know nothing of these, it is at least possible that
          he has misunderstood a notice referring to the two already
          mentioned: Keim, followed by Pélagaud, places the home of Celsus
          in the West, probably in Rome, where he thinks the "True
          Discourse" was written--partly on the ground that the Jew
          depicted by Celsus is a Roman and not an Eastern Jew. The old
          view, adopted also by Aubé, that the book was composed in the
          East, probably in Alexandria, rested upon its accurate knowledge
          of Egypt; and this view might be supported by the contention
          that as a matter of fact Celsus's Jew is really not the Roman
          type, but belongs to those Eastern Jewish circles in which the
          doctrine of the Logos was familiar; thus in Origen, ii. 31, the
          Jew of Celsus says, "If your Logos is the Son of God, we also
          give our assent to the same."

    Criticism of Celsus.

          After the introduction, there follow objections against
          Christianity from the Jewish standpoint, which should be
          compared with Justin's dialogue with Trypho. With book iii.
          begins the direct attack, which is directed not against
          Christianity alone, but also against Judaism, although a slight
          preference is shown for the latter. Celsus shows a good
          knowledge of Genesis and Exodus; Aubé thinks he can prove an
          acquaintance with the Prophets and with the Psalms, and a
          reference to Jonah and Daniel is indeed found in vii. 53. His
          knowledge of Christianity is sufficient to be of some value to
          the historian of today, and Harnack has used it in his
          Dogmengeschichte. The manner in which Celsus employs the New
          Testament corresponds to the stage of development of the canon
          which the Acts of the Martyrs of Scili show in 180. He knew and
          used our Gospels, showing a preference for the synoptic type;
          his acquaintance with the Acts is disputed, while familiarity,
          with Pauline ideas, though not with the epistles themselves, is
          generally admitted. Gnosticism he knew well; his relation to
          Marcion needs further investigation. His whole criticism is not
          irreligious; it is that of a pious pagan of Platonic tendencies,
          though his Platonism is that of his age, as we meet with it, for
          example, in Plutarch. It is the religion of well-to-do,
          self-confident people, and shows no conception of those crying
          needs of the time which helped Christianity to spread so
          rapidly, of the reasons why it was welcomed by the poor and
          oppressed. Again, he fails to appreciate the significance of the
          church idea, though he under stands the relation of the local
          communities to the Church at large (v. 59, 61), and knows that
          all Christians do not belong to the latter (iii. 12). But it
          presents itself to him rather in its opposition to the Gnostic
          sects than as a great bond of unity, whose importance he
          undervalues while seeing in the conflict of sects a sign of
          weakness. Still, Christianity seems to him important enough to
          make him desirous of winning back its adherents; and he closes,
          not, as he began (i. 1), with the accusation of secret and
          illegal association, but with the hope that an understanding may
          be reached.

    Later History of His Work.

          The book had no influence on the attitude of the Roman
          government, and scarcely a trace of acquaintance with it can be
          found in classical literature. Such traces have been seen, on
          the other hand, in Minucius Felix and in the Apologeticum of
          Tertullian; but Origen was the first to call general attention
          to it. The Neoplatonic controversialists naturally went back to
          it; certain fundamental thoughts reappear in Porphyry, whom
          Julian follows, and the Logoi philaletheis "Truth-loving
          Discourses") of Hierocles point to it in their very title.
          Meantime, however, the canon of the New Testament had been
          completed, and it was possible for assaults on Christianity to
          take the form of assaults on its sacred writings. Later
          Christian antiquity saw the typical literary attack from the
          pagan side not in Celsus but in Porphyry; Theodosius II. ordered
          the books of Porphyry, not those of Celsus or of Julian, to be
          burned in 448.

          (K. I. Neumann.)

          According to the account of Origen, the principal charges
          brought by Celsus against Christianity were as follows. The
          Christians were members of illegal secret associations which
          were necessary to them because they would suffer death if their
          practises were known. The origins, of Christianity were derived
          from secondary sources, some of these even barbarous, and Moses
          himself simply borrowed the ordinances which he promulgated. The
          alleged divinity of Jesus can not be proved from his miracles,
          since they were the mere tricks of a juggler, while the
          indications of his life and character are equally against the
          doctrine. Jewish converts to Christianity were ipso facto
          renegades, since the new religion was no improvement upon the
          old. Both the Jewish and the Christian religions were really
          rebellious against the state. The alleged theophanies were
          really the, appearances of demons, and the Christian eschatology
          is, irrational and incredible.

          some time thereafter maintained its independence by the aide of
          the new Anglo-Roman Church. It comprises two branches, one in
          Roman Britain and a continuation of it in Wales, the other in
          Ireland and Alba (Scotland).

I. Origin and Early History, to c. 500.

  1. In Britain.

          There is no trustworthy account of the introduction of
          Christianity into Britain. That the British Church of the first
          half of the sixth century had no knowledge or tradition of the
          time or manner may be inferred from the silence of Gildas. The
          Lucius story may be dismissed at once as fabulous (see
          [853]Eleutherus; [854]Chur, Bishopric of). Foreign writers give
          no more reliable information than the native sources. The
          arguments of Warren (pp. 46-62) for the introduction of
          Christianity into Britain from Greek churches in Lyons and
          Vienne as a consequence of the persecutions under Marcus
          Aurelius are not convincing [cf. F. Haverfield, Early British
          Christianity, in The English Historical Review, xi. (1896) 418,
          n. 2]. It is more probable that the Gospel came to the island by
          ordinary intercourse with other countries, and Gaul and the
          Lower Rhine lands are those of which it is most natural to
          think. Had there been organized or individual missionary effort,
          tradition would have preserved names. That Christianity was
          widely spread in Britain by the beginning of the third century
          can hardly be inferred from the notices in Tertullian and Origen
          (Haddan and Stubbs, i. 3-4), which are too rhetorical to be safe
          testimonies. It does seem certain, however, that much progress
          was made during the third century. This rests, not upon the
          sixth-century tradition of martyrs in Britain during the
          Diocletian persecution, which probably did not have any
          noteworthy extension into Britain (cf. Haddan and Stubbs, i.
          5-6), but upon the fact that three bishops, a presbyter, and a
          deacon from York, Lincoln [according to others Colchester or
          Carleonon-Usk], and London took part in the Synod of Arles in
          316 (Haddan and Stubbs, i. 7). The towns from which they came as
          well as the localities assigned for the martyrdoms mentioned by
          Gildas (St. Albans, Carleon-on-Usk) show distinctly that
          Christianity first took firm foothold in the cities and stations
          of the Roman highways.

    1. Heresies.

          The records are sufficient to show that throughout the fourth
          century there was a well-organized Church in Britain which stood
          in constant touch with the rest of the Church, particularly in
          Gaul, and considered itself an active member of that body
          (Haddan and Stubbs, i. 7-12). British bishops attended the synod
          summoned at Ariminum (Rimini) by Constantius in 359 [Haddan and
          Stubbs, i. 9-10], and their presence shows that their Church was
          drawn into general doctrinal disputes. Gildas maintains that it
          was much injured by Arianism (p. 32, ll. 20-25). His testimony
          is controverted by that of Hilary of Poitiers (c. 358) and
          Athanasius (363; both in Haddan and Stubbs, i. 7, 9). But it
          must be admitted that Arian views found acceptance in Britain
          during the second half of the fourth century, and as the Roman
          power was waning there from that time on, it is conceivable that
          such views may have lingered and found expression se late as
          600, possibly in the baptismal formula (cf. F. C. Conybeare, The
          Character of the Heresy of the Early British Church, in the
          Transactions of the Society of Cymmrodorion, 1897-98, pp.
          84-117). It is noteworthy that a life of Gildas written in the
          eleventh century, but based upon materials taken from the sixth
          century, and a life of Patrick of the second half of the seventh
          century lay stress on their devotion to the Holy Trinity
          (Chronica minora, iii. 95, ll. 8-9; Tripartite Life, ii. 273,
          ll. 12-13; 286, ll. 6-7); and Gregory the Great is said to have
          suspected Columba of not being quite sound in the doctrine
          (Bernard and Atkinson, i. 64, ii. 25). It is certain that
          Pelagianism appeared in Britain during the fifth century (see
          [855]Agricola). [856]Germanus, bishop of Auxerre, was sent
          thither in 429, and "overthrew the heretics and directed the
          Britons to the Catholic faith" (Prosper of Aquitaine, Chronicle,
          anno 429). Some years later, on a second mission, he completed
          the extirpation of Pelagianism in the island (Vita Germani, used
          by Bede, i. 17, 21). Gildas, writing a century later, does not
          mention the heresy. For a hundred years after the mission of
          Germanus nothing is heard of the Church in Britain. The land was
          abandoned by the Romans, and the Anglo-Saxon conquest caused
          Christianity to disappear completely from the East. With those
          Britons who kept their independence it found a refuge in the
          mountains of the West, whence it gradually comes again into view
          in the sixth century (see below, [857]II., 1).

  2. In Ireland.

    1. Native Tradition of Origin.

          There is native tradition of the introduction of Christianity
          into Ireland, the two oldest records of which can scarcely be
          dated earlier than the last quarter of the seventh century. They
          are (1) the life of Patrick, written by Muirchu Maccu-Machtheni
          at the wish of Bishop Aed of Sletty (d. 698), and (2) the
          collections of a certain Tirechan, a pupil of Ultan of
          Ardbrechan (d. 656), based upon information about Patrick which
          his teacher had communicated to him personally or had left in
          his papers. Both records, but with additions and amplifications,
          are in the Book of Armagh (Liber Ardmachanus), the several parts
          of which were written between 807 and 846. In brief this native
          tradition is as follows: In 431 Ireland was entirely heathen. In
          that year Pope Celestine I. sent a certain Palladius to preach
          to the people, but he turned back and died in Britain. His place
          was at once (c. 432) taken by a Briton, Patrick, who in his
          youth had been a prisoner in Ireland. He evangelized the entire
          land, founded churches everywhere, ordained bishops and
          presbyters, and died (459) universally revered as the head of
          the Church, in which he held a sort of metropolitan rank, with
          his see at Armagh in Ulster.

    2. The Tradition Unreliable.

          Everything discredits the authenticity of this tradition. (1) It
          represents Patrick as a personality comparable to Martin of
          Tours or Columba, the apostle to the Picts; such men do not fail
          to find a biographer among their admirers and associates; their
          fame grows and is spread in the next generation. But the name of
          Patrick does not appear till the second third of the seventh
          century, and then it is in the letter of [858]Cummian to the
          abbot Seghine of Iona, in connection with the introduction of
          the Dionysian (!) paschal computation, which is ascribed to him.
          He is not mentioned in the full report of the Synod of Whitby
          (664), although the arguments were historical and the Irish
          referred to the traditions of their forefathers and to Columba
          (Bede, iii. 25). Bede must have been well informed concerning
          the Church in North Ireland and his interest in the beginnings
          of Christianity in the British Isles was keen; yet he says
          nothing about Patrick in his Historia ecclesiastica. It seems
          impossible that there can have existed in the North of Ireland
          in the seventh century a tradition of a founder of the Irish
          Church called Patrick. And yet it is in the North (at Armagh)
          that the tradition (the first reports of which come from the
          South) represents Patrick as having his see and ending his days.
          (2) The tradition describes the Irish Church as episcopal,
          dependent on Patrick's see of Armagh. But as a matter of fact
          the Church of Columba and of Finnian of Clonard, i.e., from the
          end of the fifth century, is a monastic church without central
          organization and with no traces of such a past as the tradition
          presupposes. How intensely the Irish cling to the customs of
          their fathers was shown at Whitby; it took four hundred years to
          transform this monastic church of the sixth and seventh
          centuries even after the theoretical acceptance of an episcopal
          constitution. If, then, the organization was so fundamentally
          changed within one generation, as it must have been if the
          tradition be correct, an explanation is needed. And none is
          forthcoming. (3) There is good reason to believe that Ireland
          was not entirely heathen in 431. The island is easily accessible
          from Britain; and active intercourse, particularly between the
          Southwest of Britain and the Southeast of Ireland, existed as
          early as the third and fourth centuries (cf. Zimmer, Nennius
          vindicatus, pp. 85-93, Berlin, 1893; Kuno Meyer, Early Relations
          Between Gael and Brython, in the Transactions of the Society of
          Cymmrodorion, 1895-96, pp. 55-86). As has been seen, there was a
          well-organized British Church in the fourth century. It is
          natural to assume, then, that Christianity was carried to
          Ireland from Britain before the time assigned to Patrick. And
          the assumption is corroborated by certain saints' lives,
          particularly those of Declan, Ailbe, Ibhar, Ciaran, and Abban
          (ASB, July, v. 590-608; Sept., iv. 26-31; Apr., iii. 173; Mar.,
          i. 389-399; Oct., xii. 270-293; cf. also Ussher, Antiquitates,
          ed. of 1687, pp. 408 sqq.). In all these lives Patrick figures
          as "Archbishop of Ireland," but this is due to the time of
          redaction. These same men are not only Patrick's contemporaries,
          but older contemporaries, independent of him, and recognized as
          the apostles of their districts. Their locality is the
          Southeast, the coast counties of Wicklow, Wexford, and
          Waterford, and the adjoining inland counties of Kilkenny and
          Tipperary, where local testimonies to their cult still survive.
          Further evidence may be found in the fact that the two lives of
          Patrick, mentioned above, limit his activity to the North. The
          Patrick legend originated in the South and was forced upon the
          North from the time of Cummian's letter, the object being to win
          over the North Irish to conformity with the Roman Church. But
          this alone does not explain the silence of the lives concerning
          the South. It must be that, while the Southerners were willing
          to acknowledge Patrick theoretically as apostle of the North
          with his see at Armagh, hoping thereby to win over the mainstay
          of the opposing party, the abbot-bishop of Armagh, the
          traditions in the South concerning the founders of the
          monasteries there were too well known to admit of a description
          of Patrick as the apostle of the South. A third testimony is the
          fact that Ireland cherished the memory of the heresiarch
          Pelagius and was well acquainted with his writings (cf. Bede,
          ii. 19). In the seventh, eighth, and ninth centuries, the Irish
          Church possessed the original unmutilated commentary of Pelagius
          (when it had disappeared everywhere else in the West) and knew
          that Pelagius was the author. Pelagius may himself have been an
          Irishman (cf. Jerome, in MPL, xxiv. 682a, 758b). He was a
          sincere and earnest thinker and did not adopt heretical views
          until he went to Rome (c. 400). His learning was great and would
          naturally gratify the pride of his countrymen. If he came from a
          monastery of southeastern Ireland, it is easy to understand how
          his books were brought thither and how they came to be
          preserved. But, whatever may have been the nationality of
          Pelagius, his celebrity in Ireland is incompatible with the
          Patrick legend. Pelagianism was annihilated in the Roman State
          and See by Honorius and Zosimus in 418. In 429 Germanus
          successfully combated it in Britain. If, then, Ireland was
          wholly heathen in 431 and Patrick Christianized the land and
          organized its Church, he must himself have carried Pelagianism
          thither--which is, of course, absurd. But if the South was
          already Christian in the first quarter of the fifth century, it
          is quite comprehensible how Pelagianism found its way to the
          island. (4) Linguistic facts prove that Christianity came to
          Ireland from Britain. British and Irish are Celtic tongues, but
          certain differences of sound had developed by the fourth
          century. Ecclesiastical and other loan-words, introduced into
          Irish from Latin with the Christian religion, show forms hard to
          explain if they came directly from the Latin, but quite
          comprehensible if they came, through the medium of British (cf.
          Güterbock, Lateinische Lehnwörter im Irischen, pp. 91 sqq.
          Leipsic, 1882). Patrick himself was a Briton, it is true; but he
          is said to have studied on the Continent, and his associates are
          represented as of Romance origin (Tripartite Life, ii. 273, 305;
          Haddan and Stubbs, ii. 292). (5) Among the writings attributed
          to the supposed apostle of Ireland are two, the so-called
          "Confession" and the "Epistle Concerning Coroticus," which are
          undoubtedly authentic. They are the work of a man "unlearned and
          rustic, not at all such a one as later times extolled with the
          highest praises" (Schöll, p. 71; cf. p. 68), or one who could
          have founded in the fifth century the Irish Church--a Church in
          which from the sixth to the ninth century Christian and
          classical learning were united as nowhere else in the West.
          Moreover, the "Confession" is the work of a man looking back
          upon a long life, complaining bitterly of ingratitude, trying to
          defend himself from the reproach of having presumed to undertake
          a calling above his capabilities, and threatening to turn his
          back on Ireland because he recognizes the failure of his life's
          work there. And he makes not the slightest mention of ever
          having consecrated a bishop or established a single church in
          the island. (6) Finally there is the definite statement of
          Prosper of Aquitaine (Chron., anno 431) that Pope Celestine
          "ordained Palladius and sent him as their first bishop to the
          Irish believers in Christ." Prosper was probably in Rome in 431
          and issued the first edition of his "Chronicle," which contains
          the statement quoted, in 433. Here then is a record, as certain
          and credible as may be, which confirms the supposition that the
          Irish, in part at any rate, were Christians in 431. The meaning
          of Prosper's expression "first bishop" is clear, bearing in mind
          the organization of the Irish Church. Palladius was the first
          bishop canonically ordained according to Prosper's view, in
          distinction from the missionary and monastic bishops of the
          Irish Church during the fifth century. In his later Liber contra
          collatorem (written probably about 437), in the course of a
          fulsome eulogy of Celestine, Prosper states that "while he
          [Celestine] endeavored to keep the Roman island [Britain]
          Catholic, he made also the barbarous island [Ireland] Christian"
          (in MPL, Ii. 271b-c). But a rhetorical statement of this sort
          does not impair the value of the careful entry in the
          "Chronicle." Moreover, the supposition that Celestine ordained a
          simple deacon--for such Palladius still was in 431--as bishop of
          a land considered wholly heathen is in itself untenable. It was
          not customary to consecrate "bishops" for lands where there were
          no Christians. Augustine was sent by Gregory to preach to the
          Angles; but he was not consecrated till he had made converts
          among them.

    3. Prosper's Palladius the Same as Patrick.

          Before attempting to reconstruct the early history of
          Christianity in Ireland, it must be noted that the historical
          Patrick and Prospers Palladius are the same. Various reasons may
          be mentioned: (1) Palladius went from Rome to the Irish
          Christians in 431; Patrick appeared in Ireland in 432. In view
          of the difficulties of travel of the time, it is hardly
          conceivable that two different persons should have been
          despatched to Ireland within the space of one year. (2)
          Palladius went as the ordained bishop of the Irish Christians;
          Patrick (in the first sentence of the "Epistle") calls himself
          with emphasis the appointed bishop for Ireland. (3) Palladius is
          first mentioned by Prosper under the year 429 as instigating the
          mission of Germanus against Pelagianism, from which it may be
          inferred that Palladius was a Briton and stood in somewhat
          intimate relations with Germanus. This is true of Patrick
          according to his own testimony and statements of the lives
          ("Confession," Haddan and Stubbs, ii. 309, ll. 1-4; Tripartite
          Life, ii. 370, ll. 9-14; lives, ib. ii. 272, Il. 4-5; 302, ll.
          19-23). (4) If Palladius was a Briton, his Romanized name,
          according to the general custom of the time, should be a
          translation of his native name. Hence the latter should have
          some such signification as "war like" or "having to do with
          war." Patrick's British name was Sucat (Muirchu, Tripartite
          Life, ii. 494, l. 6; Tirechan, ibid. 302, l. 5; Fiacc's Hymn,
          ibid. 404-405), composed of su, "good," and cat, "war," a word
          still in use in modern Welsh in the form hygad, signifying
          "warlike." If, as was but natural, he resumed his native name on
          reaching Ireland and the name Palladius first became known there
          from Prospers work, it is easy to understand how the idea of two
          persons arose. As for the name Patrick, it is not improbable
          that Sucat-Palladius assumed it himself. He was especially proud
          of his alleged aristocratic descent (cf. his words in Haddan and
          Stubbs, ii. 316, ll. 15-17; 306, ll. 26-27; Tripartite Life, ii.
          377, ll. 19-22; 368, ll. 1-2), which, however, was not so
          distinguished as he would make out. In Rome at that time the
          title Patricius was often conferred upon high officials of the
          empire to indicate rank. The somewhat narrow-minded Sucat,
          applying Roman conditions to the little British country town of
          Bannaventa, where his father had been senator or mayor, may have
          taken to himself the title Patricius, and so figured in Ireland
          as Sucat Patricius, and in his writings merely as Patricius. If
          this name entered into the Irish vernacular of the fifth
          century, according to linguistic laws it should appear in Irish
          of the seventh century as Cathrige or Cothrige. And it is a fact
          that a number of sources (Tirechan, Fiacc's Hymn, and others)
          state that Patrick was also called Cothrige.

    4. True Origin of the Irish Church.

          As a result of the foregoing argument, the origin and early
          history of the Celtic Church in Ireland seems to be as follows:
          Christianity was brought to Ireland from Britain during the
          fourth century as a natural outcome of the close intercourse
          between southwest Britain and southeast Ireland. The actual
          foundation of a Church, extending over large parts of the
          island, must be regarded as a result of that first great wave of
          monasticism which swept over Gaul and Britain from the middle of
          the fourth century and carried a number of half-Romanized
          Christian Britons to Ireland. Two facts confirm this view: (1)
          The great repute of Martin of Tours in Ireland, so great that in
          the ninth century it was thought desirable to bring the new
          apostle, Patrick, into close relations with Martin, and he was
          even accounted the latter's nephew. (2) The difference between
          the organization of the Irish Church and that of the British
          Church from which it sprang. Just how fast and how far
          Christianity spread can not be ascertained, but it seems safe to
          say that the northeast coast was Christian about 400. It is
          noteworthy that Patrick, in the two passages of the "Confession"
          where he speaks of his six years' captivity in North Ireland
          (Haddan and Stubbs, ii. 296, ll. 5 sqq.; 300, ll. 16 sqq.;
          Tripartite Life, ii. 357, ll. 7 sqq.; 361, ll. 19 sqq.), does
          not intimate by a single word that the Irish with whom he lived
          were heathen. This is the more remarkable since he dwells with
          horror on the paganism of the pirates into whose hands he fell
          when he made his escape (Haddan and Stubbs, ii. 301, l. 16-303,
          l. 2; Tripartite Life, ii. 362, l. 19-363, l. 34). No doubt the
          Saxons drove a number of Christian Britons into Ireland, as well
          as to the Armorican coast of Gaul, during the fifth century.

    5. St. Patrick.

          A Briton named Sucat played a prominent part in the Irish Church
          during the second third of the fifth century. The following
          outline of his life is based upon his own statements in the
          "Confession," and the notices of Prosper, interpreted as above.
          He was born about 386 in the borough of Bannaventa in central
          Britain, probably near the modern Daventry in Northamptonshire.
          His family possessed some wealth and had been Christian for
          generations. He led an easy worldly life until the age of
          sixteen (402), when plundering Irish carried him off as a slave
          to North Ireland. For six years (402-408) he was a swineherd.
          Reflection and changed circumstances made him a new man. He
          practised austerities, saw visions, and heard voices which
          counseled him to flee. He reached the coast and fell in there
          with heathen (doubtless Saxons), who took him to Britain and led
          him about the country for sixty days. Then he escaped and
          finally arrived at his home (408 or 409). There he became a
          deacon. His visions continued, and eventually he came to believe
          himself called to be the bishop of Ireland. In his native place,
          where he was looked upon as an enthusiast, narrowminded, and of
          defective education, obstacles arose to his consecration. His
          parents and friends were against it. So he left home at the age
          of thirty-eight (c. 424), and followed the old road by way of
          Auxerre (where he stayed some time with Germanus), through the
          Rhone valley, by way of Arles, along the coast of Provence and
          the Lerinian islands, through Upper Italy, to Rome. If Ultan may
          be believed (Tirechan, Tripartite Life, ii. 302, ll. 19-23), he
          spent seven years wandering through Gaul and Italy. His
          barbarian name was Latinized into Palladius. At Rome he gained
          influence probably the more readily since for twenty years
          Britain had been separated from the empire and the connection
          between the British Church and Rome had become difficult.
          Perhaps also he exaggerated his family's position and influence
          to the leading ecclesiastical circles. In 429 he was
          instrumental in sending Germanus of Auxerre to Britain, and in
          431 he attained his heart's desire and was consecrated episcopus
          for Ireland. He reached Ireland in 432, dropped the Roman
          translation of his name, and assumed in its stead the title
          Patricaus. There are no trustworthy details of his activity in
          Ireland. But he was never recognized as its "appointed bishop."
          In the letter on Coroticua he says complainingly "although now I
          am despised by some," and in the "Confession," written near the
          end of his life, he characterizes himself as " despised by
          most." His very limited literary education may well have aroused
          the scorn and derision of his more cultured associates. How far
          he extended his missionary efforts in Connaught and the
          Northwest, where there must still have been opportunity for such
          work, can hardly be ascertained from the "Confession," the only
          source of any authority. Its words are those of a monkish
          ascetic to whom convertere ad deum is identical with "to enter a
          monastery," and definite inferences can not be drawn from its
          statements.

          There are some indications of the locality where the historical
          Patrick lived. Muirchu (Tripartite Life, ii. 275, l. 13) says
          that the legendary Patrick landed at a port called Hostium Dee,
          near the present Wicklow. As the tendency of the legend required
          Patrick to settle in the North as soon as possible, it is
          probable that an item, of true tradition is preserved here.
          Muirchu was himself from County Wicklow and used the
          "Confession" and "Epistle" of Sucat as sources of his life. Aed,
          at whose request Muirchu wrote, was bishop of Sletty in Queen's
          County, near Carlow. Cummian, who was the first to mention the
          legendary Patrick, was also a native of the South. Therefore the
          South of Ireland possessed the material left by the historical
          Patrick (the Confessio and the Epistola) as well as notices of
          his life. Hence it is probable that Patrick settled somewhere in
          County Wicklow. He died Mar. 17, 459, according to the statement
          in the Luxeuil Calendar and the most trustworthy entries of the
          Annals. He was soon forgotten save in the district of his
          special activity; and here, in the seventh century, under the
          influence of a specific tendency, he was resurrected and made
          the apostle of the Irish, as Augustine was the apostle of the
          Saxons and Columba of the Picts.

          It is not possible to say definitely why Patrick does not
          mention his consecration by Pope Celestine in the "Confession."
          But it may be recalled that for three hundred years the Roman
          Empire was a standing menace to the liberty of the Irish.
          Without doubt bitter feelings and hatred were still alive in
          432, and the Irish were not likely to distinguish carefully
          between spiritual and temporal Rome. If, therefore, when Patrick
          arrived in Ireland he tried to impress the Christian Irish with
          his ordination by Celestine, he must soon have found out his
          mistake. With his religious feelings and views, Patrick would
          look upon Celestine merely as the instrument of God, who had
          himself appeared to him in visions and dreams and appointed him
          apostle to the Irish. And it was only natural that to the old
          man on the brink of the grave Celestine's slight and casual
          intervention in his life should fade away before the image of
          God Almighty, whose chosen one he was. (For other views
          concerning St. Patrick, see the article [859]Patrick, Saint.)

  3. In North Britain (Alba).

          From statements by Beda (iii. 4) we know that a Briton named
          Nynia ([860]St. Ninian) founded a monastery on the peninsula of
          Wigtown, in the extreme Southwest of Scotland, about 400, and
          thence spread Christianity among the Picts south of the
          Grampians. The germs of the young faith seem to have been
          destroyed in the confusion which arose in North Britain early in
          the fifth century. In two passages of his letter concerning
          Coroticus Patrick with evident anger calls the Picts "apostates"
          (Haddan and Stubbs, ii. 314, l. 13; 318, l. 5; Tripartite Life,
          ii. 375, l. 26; 379, l. 7). Coroticus was probably a king of the
          Strathclyde Britons, ruling near the modern Dumbarton between
          420 and 450. His subjects were Christians; and as Patrick does
          not reproach the Irish (Scotti), living to the northwest, with
          paganism, it may be that they also, like their countrymen on the
          opposite coast of Antrim, were Christians.

II. Development and Full Maturity, 500-800.

  1. In Britain.

    1. The Church in Wales.

          The British Church reappears in Wales in the second third of the
          sixth century, and is the direct continuation of the Church of
          the fourth century. That the latter consisted mainly of Roman
          residents of the towns while is the Britons in the country
          remained heathen, and that the Celtic Church first arose after
          the withdrawal of the Romans, is an opinion based upon defective
          knowledge of conditions in Roman and post-Roman Britain and is
          disproved by the fact that the Christian missionaries to Ireland
          in the fourth century and the Christians who settled in Armorica
          in the fifth spoke British, i.e., they were native Britons, not
          Roman occupants of the country. The external organization of the
          sixth century, however, is not an uninterrupted development from
          the fourth. When the Britons fled from the Saxons to the thinly
          populated hill-regions of the West, they found there no cities
          to serve as centers of ecclesiastical organization. But
          monasticism, which had flourished in Britain from the end of the
          fourth century, soon created new centers. Dioceses were formed,
          each based on the monastery of a clan and comprising the
          territory belonging to the clan. In time these were combined
          into larger organisms, and during the seventh century the
          ecclesiastical organization of Wales was definitively fixed by
          the constitution of four bishoprics, corresponding to the four
          political divisions, viz.: Bangor on Menai Straits in Gwynedd;
          St. Asaph in the Northeast in Powys; Menevia (St. David's) in
          the Southwest in Dyfed; and Llandaff in the Southeast in Gwent.
          They were independent of one another and based on the chief
          monasteries of the territories named. Abbot and bishop were
          generally the same. According to the Annales Cambriæ, the
          founders of the four bishoprics died in 584 (Daniel of Bangor),
          601 (David of Menevia), and 612 (Dubricius of Llandaff and
          Kentigern of St. Asaph).

    2. The British Church and Augustine.

          The result of Gregory's mission to the Saxons (see
          [861]Anglo-Saxons, Conversion of the; [862]Augustine, Saint, of
          Canterbury) was to intensify and perpetuate the isolation from
          which the British Church already suffered. Two conferences were
          held between its representatives and Augustine (602 or 603), but
          the Britons rejected the proposals of the Roman missionary and
          refused to have him for archbishop (Bede, ii. 2; cf. Bright, pp.
          86-93). Augustine's unskilful management may have contributed to
          the result--he is said to have offended the Britons by not
          rising to meet them--but he offered to overlook all other
          differences if the Britons on their part would accept the Roman
          computation for Easter, would remove divergences from Roman
          practise in the baptismal rite; and would join him in preaching
          the Gospel to the Saxons. The third requirement was probably the
          chief obstacle, and union was not effected because the Britons
          regarded the missionary as the representative of their hated
          foes. In his disappointment Augustine is said to have threatened
          the obstinate Celts with death at the hands of the English if
          they would not preach to them the way of life. Eight, or perhaps
          twelve, years after Augustine's death Ethelfrid, the heathen
          king of Northumbria, massacred a large company of British
          priests and the monks of Bangor at Chester, and the prophecy was
          thought to be fulfilled.

          When the South Irish Church conformed to Rome, about 630, the
          Welsh Church was cut off on both sides, and this isolation
          proved fatal to its spiritual culture. Its most eminent
          representative in the sixth century is Gildas, and after him
          there is no one of greater literary merit than Nennius at the
          end of the eighth century. According to the Annales Cambriæ,
          Elbodug, bishop of Bangor, adopted the Roman Easter computation
          in 768: the Chronicle of Welsh Princes gives the date as 755 and
          says that South Wales followed in 777 (Haddan and Stubbs, i.
          203-204). But opposition did not cease at that time, for the
          same source says that when Elbodug died in 809 "a great
          controversy arose because of Easter."

  2. In Ireland and North Britain.

    1. The Irish Church not Revived from Wales in the Sixth Century.

          The earliest native and foreign sources show a flourishing
          church in Ireland in the sixth century. Its type is that of a
          mission-church, resting not on the labors of a single man, but
          growing, without central organization, in a land divided among
          many clans, through the constant activity of a missionary
          monkhood. It is the natural development of the seed sown in
          southeastern Ireland by British missionaries from the middle of
          the fourth century, springing up and increasing undisturbed by
          outside influences. This view is quite different from the
          prevalent one, which assumes, on the one hand, a complete
          collapse of the Irish Church at the end of the fifth century,
          and, on the other hand, a revival in the sixth century due to
          the influence of the Welsh Church, and particularly of such men
          as Gildas Cadoc, and David. A collapse about 500 is
          inexplicable, and is assumed only because necessitated by the
          Patrick legend and the hypothesis of a revival from Britain in
          the sixth century. This hypothesis rests upon: (1) statements
          concerning the activity of Gildas in Ireland, made in his life
          written at Ruys in Brittany in the eleventh century; (2) the
          view of the Irish Church of the fifth and sixth centuries found
          in the eighth century Catalogus sanctorum Hiberniæ; [12] and (3)
          notes of certain saints' lives [such as that of [863]St.
          Disibod], certainly not older than the eleventh or twelfth
          century (cf. Haddan and Stubbs, i. 115, n.a.). On the other
          hand, a mere enumeration of dates shows that the Irish Church
          was in no need of revival. Finnian of Clonard, the father of the
          "twelve apostles of Ireland," died in 548. Columbia founded the
          monastery of Derry about 546 and Durrow before 560. Ciaran
          founded Clonmacnoise 541 and died 548. Comgall founded Bangor in
          Ulster 554 or 558. Brendan founded Clonfert in Longford 552. In
          563 Columba went to Iona. The authority of an eleventh-century
          monk of Ruys is not to be put above such evidence as this. Nor
          can the statements of ignorant authors of saints' lives, who
          confuse different centuries, furnish the basis for a historical
          construction at variance with all fixed dates. There is no
          evidence of British influence in Ireland apart from the visit of
          Gildas there in 566 (cf. Mommsen, Chronica minora, iii. 6, ll.
          3-23). [This visit is considered doubtful by some; see
          [864]Gildas.] The Church of Gildas, Cadoc, and David, it may be
          noted, was episcopal; if then these men, and men like them,
          revived the dying Irish episcopal Church, why did they
          substitute another entirely monastic with no trace of an
          episcopal character? Furthermore, the Church in Britain at this
          time was in no condition to infuse fresh life into the Irish
          Church. In the trouble and turmoil of the fifth century it had
          lost all organization, and Gildas himself draws a gloomy picture
          of the state of things in Britain before 547. Ireland, however,
          did not suffer from barbarian attacks, and her Church was able
          to develop undisturbed. Hence the natural supposition is that at
          this time the Irish Church was the giver and the British Church
          the recipient. And we know that from the very beginning of the
          sixth century Irish clerics went to southwest Britain and to
          Brittany, giving and spreading knowledge, not receiving it. The
          foundation of new monasteries in Ireland by Finnian of Clonard
          and men regarded as his disciples between 520 and 560 can not be
          considered a restoration or reformation of the Irish Church.
          There was already a large number of older monasteries, such as
          Emly in Munster and Armagh in Ulster, which for centuries played
          a greater role in the entire life of the Irish Church than any
          of these new foundations. Finnian was a sort of Irish Benedict
          of Nursia; he established his new house at Clonard by the side
          of the older institutions--rather mission-stations than
          monasteries--with stricter rules, and through the influence on
          Comgall and Columba it became the model of the Irish monasteries
          in North Britain and on the Continent. [13]

    2. Learning of the Irish Monks.

          The Irish Church of the sixth, seventh, and eighth centuries,
          then, was the natural development of the Church of the fourth
          and fifth centuries, without interference from outside. This
          freedom accounts for the high standard of learning maintained by
          the Irish monasteries till the ninth century. They kept the
          knowledge and culture received with Christianity, and cherished
          it at a time when everywhere else, in Britain, Gaul, and Italy,
          barbarian hordes came near to stamping it out. The erudition of
          the Irish monks in the sixth century--surely not derived from a
          Church whose greatest scholar was Gildas--surpassed on the whole
          that of Italy. Greek was studied at Bangor when Gregory the
          Great probably had no knowledge of the language. In the seventh
          century Aldhelm, writing to a young friend returning home from
          the Irish schools (MPL, lxxxix. 94 c-d), reluctantly admits the
          superiority of Irish scholarship. And in the eighth century Bede
          speaks with admiration of Irish learning (iii. 7, 27; [cf.
          Plummer's note to iii. 27, p. 192]).

    3. Travels and Missionary Labors.

          Besides their zeal for learning, a noteworthy love of wandering
          characterized the Irish monks. Singly or in groups they went
          forth from the great monk-colonies--for such the monasteries
          really were--to seek a form of the anchorite's life. They were
          content at first with the isles of their own lakes and rivers;
          then they betook themselves to the many islands of the Irish
          coast; then to the Hebrides, the Orkneys, and the Shetland
          Islands, and before 800 they had reached Iceland. At the same
          time others went to Britain--where many Christian inscriptions
          of the fifth, sixth, and seventh centuries with Irish names and
          written in Ogham bear witness to their presence north and south
          of the Severn estuary--and to Brittany, and then through the
          land of the Franks to the Alps and across the Alps, so that
          Bobbio (perhaps Tarentum; see [865]Cataldus; [866]Columban)
          became the southern, as Iceland was the northern, limit of their
          wanderings. Their primary purpose was not missionary work; but
          circumstances made them missionaries and teachers of the people
          among whom they settled to lead the contemplative life.

    4. North Britain Christianized.

          The greatest achievement of the Irish Church and its monks in
          the sixth and seventh centuries, the Christianization of North
          Britain, must be regarded from the same point of view. With
          twelve companions [867]Columba left Ireland in 563, "wishing to
          go into exile for Christ" (Adamnan's Life of Columba, p. 9).
          They settled on the little island of Iona (Eo, Io, Hi),
          belonging to the Irish (Christian) state north of the Clyde,
          took up missionary work among the heathen Picts of the
          neighborhood and rapidly extended it, so that when Columba died
          (597), the mainland north of Glasgow and Edinburgh, as well as
          the western islands, was studded with monasteries, whose inmates
          looked after the spiritual welfare of the neighboring
          population, all of them dependent on the mother monastery at
          [868]Iona. A generation later Oswald, king of Northumbria, who
          had been converted to Christianity during a seventeen years'
          exile in Ireland, applied to Columba's successor for
          missionaries to introduce Christianity in his realm. [869]Aidan
          was sent (635) and under his lead and that of his successors,
          Finan (652-661) and Colman (661-664), with the earnest support
          of Oswald and his brother Oswy, the Gospel made rapid and
          splendid progress. Monasteries were founded, such as Mailros
          (Old Melrose) by Aidan, the first nunnery by Heiu at Hartlepool,
          the double monastery for both men and women at Coldingham by
          Oswald's half-sister, Ebba, the monastery at Whitby by Hilda,
          and others. Christianity and the Irish Church reached to the
          Angles living south of the Humber.

    5. Relations with Rome.

          This flourishing state of the Irish Church was disturbed by the
          Roman mission to the Saxons in 597. Like the British Church,
          that of Ireland differed in some respects from the Roman Church
          of Gregory's time, the most important divergences being the form
          of the tonsure and the method of computing Easter [cf. Plummer's
          Bede, ii. 348-354; Bright, pp. 86-93, 224-225]. In 604
          Augustine's successor, Laurence, with his fellow bishops,
          Mellitus and Justus, sent a letter to Ireland exhorting to
          conformity to Roman usage, but without success (Bede, ii. 4). A
          party favorable to conformity gradually arose through visits of
          Irish clerics to Gaul and Rome, and partly perhaps through
          influence of the Anglo-Roman Church, but in 627 it was still in
          the minority, for the exhortation of Pope Honorius I. to conform
          in 628 was again unsuccessful (Bede, ii. 19). Honorius then
          excommunicated Ireland (Cummian's letter, 977, ll. 5-6) and in
          629 the Southeast generally observed the Roman date. Farther
          west opinions wavered, but in 630 the abbots met in a synod at
          Mag Lena near Tullamore, and decided to celebrate Easter the
          next year with the Roman Church. Opposition, however, made
          another meeting necessary and the Roman party failed to win a
          decisive victory. They sent an embassy to Rome, which returned
          in 633. Through the influence of this embassy and the death
          (636) of Fintan, abbot of Taghmon in County Wexford (see
          [870]Fintan, Saint), leader of the opposition, the Roman party
          finally prevailed in the South. The North held out stubbornly
          for sixty years longer. Cummian's letter to Seghine, abbot of
          Iona (634), and a letter from Pope John IV. (partly preserved by
          Bede, ii. 19) in 640 to the prominent abbots of the North were
          ineffectual. The details of the struggle are not known, but it
          may be assumed that the Patrick legend was not the least
          important of the expedients resorted to to work upon the North
          Irish.

    6. The Patrick Legend.

          It was natural for the Irish to seek for an apostle who should
          be to them what Columba was to the Picts and Augustine to the
          Saxons. In the neighborhood of Wicklow a certain Patricius was
          remembered who had called himself the "appointed bishop of
          Ireland." Is it unreasonable to assume that about 625 it came to
          be believed in the Southeast that the apostle was found in this
          man? The scanty history of Patrick was filled out by analogy
          with that of Columba and Augustine. The Irish were supposed to
          have been all heathen in 432 as the Picts had been in 563 and
          the Saxons in 597. Patrick converted the land in a brief time,
          established a Christian Church, and won the favor of King
          Laeghaire as Columba had that of King Brude and Augustine that
          of Ethelbert of Kent. This legend was at once utilized, if not
          invented, by the Roman party, as is evident from the first
          mention of it in Cummian's letter. He attributes to Patrick the
          introduction of the Dionysian cycle in Ireland, although it was
          not introduced in Rome till the sixth century (col. 975c).

    7. Conforms to Roman Usage.

          The legend was also useful in winning over the bishop of Armagh.
          As the presumed successor of St. Patrick he was acknowledged in
          the South as metropolitan (cf. Tripartite Life, ii. 346, ll.
          21-24). The claims of Armagh, however, met with violent
          opposition in the eighth and ninth centuries both in Connaught
          and Munster. Northumbria conformed to Rome after the [871]Synod
          of Whitby in 664, whereupon the Irish returned to their native
          land (see [872]Colman, Saint). Adamnan, ninth abbot of Iona
          (679-704), was persuaded to yield while visiting the court of
          Aldfrid in Northumbria in 686 or 687-688, but was unable to
          control the abbots of the dependent monasteries or his own monks
          at Iona when he returned home (Bede, v. 15). Then he went to
          North Ireland and with an Angle, Egbert (see [873]Egbert,
          Saint), took the lead in efforts to win over the Irish party.
          The bishop of Armagh yielded in 697. The Columban monasteries
          continued obstinate. In 713 Naiton, king of the Picts, enlisted
          the services of [874]Ceolfrid, the distinguished abbot of
          Wearmouth and Jarrow; the latter wrote a long letter on the
          Easter question, which Naiton sent in copy to all clerics in his
          dominion with an order to obey (Bede, v. 21). Those who
          continued recalcitrant were expelled from the country in 717. In
          716 Egbert persuaded the abbot and monks of Iona to celebrate
          Easter at the Roman date. Their compliance, however, came too
          late to save the position of Iona as the center of a great
          monastic church. It was reduced to a mere parent monastery with
          a few affiliated houses on the west coast of North Britain and
          belonging to the Irish state. Armagh, on the other head, by
          timely yielding and a skilful use of the Patrick legend had
          prepared the way for becoming the head of an episcopal church
          comprising all Ireland.

III. Complete Assimilation to the Roman Church, 800-1200.

  1. In Wales.

          The Church in Wales, having been episcopal from the first,
          differed from the Roman Church only in subordinate points after
          it had conformed in respect to Easter and the tonsure. Political
          conditions hastened its complete assimilation to the Roman-Saxon
          Church. From the time of Egbert of Wessex (d. 836) the weaker
          Welsh chieftains sought the protection of the English kings
          against their more powerful countrymen. The attacks of the
          Northmen also, which from 853 on were felt more and more
          severely in Wales, promoted friendly feelings and relations
          between the two nations. That the culture of its clergy was
          higher after the isolation of the Welsh Church was ended is
          evident from the appointment and position of [875]Asser, a
          nephew of Bishop Novis of Menevia, as teacher, counselor, and
          friend of Alfred. At the end of the tenth and beginning of the
          eleventh century, consecration of bishops of Llandaff by the
          archbishop of Canterbury seems to have been the rule, and there
          is some reason to believe that an earlier bishop, Cyfeiliawc (d.
          927), was so consecrated. The Anglo-Norman archbishops Lanfranc
          (1070-89) and Anselm (1093-1109) repeatedly interfered in Welsh
          matters as if the Welsh bishops stood legally under the primate
          of England. Disputes concerning the boundaries of the Welsh
          dioceses of St. David's and Llandaff and the English diocese of
          Hereford between 1119 and 1133 were referred to Rome. About this
          time the bishop of St. David's began to set up the claim to
          metropolitan rank. After 1187, when Archbishop Baldwin of
          Canterbury as papal legate held a visitation in parts of Wales
          and preached the Crusade, the Welsh Church may be regarded as
          part of the English Church, although as late as 1284 the bishop
          of St. David's formally protested against the visitation of
          Archbishop Peckham of Canterbury. [Welsh tradition and the
          rapidity with which the Lollard movement in the fourteenth
          century spread among the English-speaking people on the borders
          of Wales favor the theory that the ancient British form of
          Christianity persisted in Wales throughout the Middle Ages side
          by aide with the Roman Catholic establishment. The mountainous
          character of the country and the character of the language,
          which Englishmen rarely acquired, were favorable to the
          perpetuation of evangelical dissent. A. H. N.]

  2. In Ireland.

    1. Incursions of the Norsemen.

          A systematic sketch of the development of the Irish branch of
          the Celtic Church in this period is not yet possible owing to
          the defective character of the special investigations. A factor
          deserving more attention than it has commonly received is the
          influence of the incursions and settlements of the Norsemen. The
          Viking period--beginning in 795 and lasting more than 150
          years--brought indescribable wo to all Britain and particularly
          to Christian Ireland. Churches and monasteries, as the centers
          of civilization and the Christian religion, were marked for
          destruction by the heathen Norwegians and Danes. Certain of the
          Irish monasteries (such as Iona, Bangor in Ulster, and many
          others) lay temptingly exposed to seafaring robbers. The rivers
          gave them easy access to the heart of the land from both the
          east and the west coast. The wooden structures of the
          monasteries were an easy prey to the flames, in which both books
          and monks perished. If any manuscripts escaped burning they were
          thrown into the water. A heathen Viking state in Armagh between
          832 and 845 compelled the abbot-bishop, Forindan, to flee to
          Munster. At the same time the Norwegian heathen were settling in
          the interior, but they were either ultimately expelled or
          absorbed by the native population and became Christian. In 852,
          however, a Viking kingdom was set up at Dublin, which remained
          heathen and plundered Ireland and all the coasts of the Irish
          Sea for more than a century.

    2. Irish Monks on the Continent.

          Under such conditions it is not surprising that the exodus of
          Irish monks to the Continent continued and increased from 800
          on. In the ninth century they were teachers in the monastic
          schools everywhere in the land of the Franks, at St. Denis,
          Pavia, and on the Upper and Lower Rhine, and they spread the
          repute of Irish learning so that it is almost a truism to say:
          Whoever knew Greek on the Continent in the days of Charles the
          Bald was an Irishman or had learned it from an Irishman (cf. H.
          Zimmer, Ueber die Bedeutung des irischen Elements für
          mittelalterliche Kultur, in Preussische Jahrbücher, lix., 1887,
          pp. 27-59; L. Traube, O Roma nobilis in Abhandlungen der
          philosophisch-philologischen Klasse der königlich-bayerischen
          Akademie, xix., 1892, pp. 332-363). They took their manuscripts
          with them in such numbers that no fewer than 117 Irish
          manuscripts, or fragments of such, older than the eleventh
          century are still extant in Continental libraries, not counting
          those in the Vatican or the Bibliothèque Nationale (cf. W.
          Schultze, Die Bedeutung der iroschottischen Mönche, in
          Centralblatt für Bibliothekswesen, 6th year, 1889, pp. 287-298).
          But if this was the Continent's gain, it was Ireland's loss.
          King Brian (1002-13) had to send across the sea "to buy books"
          (J. H. Todd, The War of the Gaedhil with the Gaill, Rolls
          Series, no. 48, p.138, London, 1867). The standard of education
          in the monasteries sank with each generation, and the new and
          inferior priesthood had less power to resist the forces which
          were substituting for the native monastic church an episcopal
          church with metropolitan head. The Irish chieftains and princes
          also, instead of uniting against the common foe, thought the
          time most fitting to fight out their domestic feuds. The
          monasteries were involved in these quarrels, not to mention
          fierce and bloody disputes between monasteries themselves when
          their interests happened to clash. Thus the old organization was
          weakened and broken up. Furthermore, the Patrick legend became a
          sort of dogma during the eighth century; and its view of the
          Christianization of Ireland and the position of the episcopus in
          church government was an additional force shaking the firmly
          built edifice of the monastic church of the sixth and seventh
          centuries.

    3. Rise of Armagh.

          It can be shown from the Annaia of Ulster that the abbot-bishop
          of Armagh, making free use of his opportunities, between 730 and
          850 attained to some extent to that primacy in the Irish Church
          which was the logical outcome of the Patrick legend. The year
          805 was decisive for Meath, 824 for Connaught, and 822, as well
          as Forindan's stay in Munster from 841 to 845, for South
          Ireland; thenceforth the see of Armagh had its tax-gatherers for
          Patrick's pence in all Ireland, excluding of course the Viking
          state whose ruler resided at Dublin. In 943 this ruler, Amlaib
          mac Sitricca (Norse, Olafr Sigtriggvasonr), became a Christian
          in England and was baptized by Wulfhelm, archbishop of
          Canterbury, Edmund, king of England, standing as his godfather.
          As Christianity spread among his subjects they naturally looked
          toward Canterbury and drew their clerics from England. The
          incumbents of newly established Norse bishoprics of Dublin,
          Waterford, and Limerick were consecrated at Canterbury. This was
          not satisfactory to the bishop of Armagh, who desired revenues
          from the rich Norse settlements in Dublin. He again had recourse
          to the Patrick legend, utilizing a detail of it which had
          already become current; namely, that Patrick had converted the
          Vikings. One of his adherents, writing about 1000, tells how the
          saint had converted the heathen Norse of Dublin, and
          consequently asserts that the successor of "Patrick of Armagh
          with the great revenues" had a right to an ounce of gold "from
          each nose" in the Dublin Viking state (cf. H. Zimmer, Keltische
          Beiträge, iii., in Zeitschrift für deutsches Alterthum, xxxv.,
          1891, pp. 54-85).

    4. The Culdees.

          Another phenomenon in the inner development of the Irish Church
          in this period which deserves attention is the appearance of the
          so-called Culdees (Irish, céli dé; Latin, colidei). It is
          difficult to define exactly the origin and position of these
          men. The Irish name does not furnish a trustworthy clue. It
          meant originally one who enters God's service and devotes
          himself to him to death, and could be applied, like vir dei in
          Latin, to monks and anchorites in general. Hector Boece, the
          Scottish historian of the sixteenth century, started the theory
          that the Culdei, as he calls them, were the direct continuation
          of Irish monasticism of the sixth, seventh, and eighth
          centuries, or even of Celtic monasticism in general. But Bishop
          Reeves has shown that the term as used from the ninth to the
          twelfth century was applied to members of spiritual associations
          whose existence can not with certainty be traced earlier than
          about 800. Hence the associations of the Colidei must have been
          formed in Ireland about this time and an existing term of
          general application was given a more limited signification to
          designate their members. Apparently Chrodegang's monastic rule
          (749), designed originally for Metz, was brought to Ireland in
          the eighth century, and Irish anchorites, who were not under
          regular monastic rule, were first associated in accordance with
          it. The Culdees were never of great importance in Ireland. They
          are mentioned in nine places, often in connection with
          monasteries to which the house of the Culdees forms a sort of
          annex. The care of the sick and the poor was their chief charge,
          and they also seem to have been entrusted with the choral part
          of the service. In North Britain, however, whither they went
          from Ireland, they attained to greater importance. Naiton's
          expulsion of the refractory monks of Iona in 717 left gaps in
          the clergy which the new associations of the Colidei helped to
          fill. They appear in Scotland as a mixture of secular clergy and
          anchorites organized after monastic pattern; at a later time
          they resemble the regular canons of the Continent. There was a
          want of connection between different convents due to the lack of
          a common head and fixed forms. Hence there were wide
          divergences, and contemporary descriptions and opinions differ
          greatly. They were ultimately absorbed in the Roman orders,
          which were introduced in Ireland and Scotland during the twelfth
          century.

    5. Final Subjection to Rome.

          The full subjection of the Celtic Church of Ireland to that of
          Rome was accomplished after 1050. Archbishop Lanfranc of
          Canterbury found opportunity to interfere in Ireland in 1074 and
          sent a letter to the king, Torlogh O'Brian, through Gilpatrick,
          the Norse bishop of Dublin. Instigated by both, Gregory VII.
          sent a letter to Ireland and appointed Gilbert, the Norse bishop
          of Limerick, papal legate for Ireland. As in the seventh
          century, so now, the bishop of Armagh resisted. But in the end
          Gilbert found a man who fell in with his views, when in 1106
          Celsus succeeded to the see of Armagh. At the Synod of
          Rathbreasail in 1120 it was decided to divide Ireland into
          twenty-four dioceses, all except Dublin subordinate to Armagh.
          In 1152 a synod was held at Kells, under the presidency of the
          papal legate, Paparo, and Ireland was divided into four
          provinces, Armagh was selected as the see of the primate, and
          the bishops of Dublin, Cashel, and Tuam were promoted to
          archbishops and received pallia brought from Rome. The complete
          Romanization of the Irish Church in internal affairs was
          effected in furtherance of the political interests of the
          Anglo-Normans at a synod held at Cashel in 1172 by command of
          Henry II.

  3. In North Britain.

          In 844 Kenneth mac Alpin, ruler of the Irish state in North
          Britain, mounted the throne of the united North and South Picts,
          and thereby created a united kingdom of Alba, later known as
          Scotland. In 850 Kenneth had the bones of Columba removed from
          Iona (which, because of constant attacks from the Vikings, had
          fallen into complete decay) and deposited at Dunkeld, in the
          land of the South Picts, the mainstay of his power. At the same
          time he established a bishopric at Dunkeld, apparently aiming to
          form here a center for a national church like Iona in the
          seventh century with a different basis, however, the
          abbot-bishop of Dunkeld being at the head of the church
          government as bishop and not as abbot. In 865 Kenneth's son,
          Constantine, removed the see of the bishopric to Abernethy,
          leaving Dunkeld with an abbot only. In 908 the see of the
          primate was transferred to St. Andrews and a parliament of the
          same year exempted the Church from taxation. Margaret,
          grandniece of Edward the Confessor and the queen of Scotland
          1069-93, took energetically in hand the reformation of the
          Scottish Church according to Roman rules and usages. She
          received efficient support from her confessor, Turgot, abbot of
          Durham (see [876]Turgot). Her sons, Edgar (1097-1107), Alexander
          (1107-24), and David (1124-53) continued and completed their
          mother's reforms. In 1107 Turgot was appointed to the see of St.
          Andrews and was consecrated at York. His successor, Eadmer, a
          Canterbury monk, at the desire of King Alexander was chosen and
          consecrated by Ralph, archbishop of Canterbury (1115). By 1188
          the outward and inward transformation of ecclesiastical Scotland
          into a Roman province was complete. It was then declared
          independent of Canterbury and, like the Irish Church, came
          directly under the sovereignty of Rome through a bull of Clement
          III. (cf. Haddan and Stubbs, ii. 273-274). The land was divided
          into nine dioceses with strictly defined boundaries, and
          Augustinian, Benedictine, and Cistercian monks were introduced
          and absorbed the remnant of the national Celtic monasticism.

IV. Some General Considerations.

  1. Reason for the Divergences from Rome.

          Concerning institutions and doctrine, neither tradition nor
          history offers any support to the view that the Celtic Church in
          its prime almost reproduced the Church of the Apostolic Age. The
          British Church of the fourth century was a part of the Catholic
          Church of the West, just as Britain was a part of the Roman
          Empire. And the Irish Church was an offshoot of the British
          Church. The divergences from Rome which both branches of the
          Celtic Church showed at the beginning of the seventh century are
          easily explicable. It must not be forgotten that the position of
          the bishop of Rome in the time of Leo the Great (440-461) was
          different from that of Pope Gregory the Great (590-604); that
          the fourth century knew nothing of that rigid uniformity of
          institutions which at the beginning of the seventh century was
          looked upon as an essential requirement of the unites catholica;
          and that innovations domesticated themselves slowly in the more
          distant members of the Church. About 400 the British branch of
          the Catholic Church was cut off because political Rome lost its
          hold on Britain. A series of events of the early fifth century
          is instructive for the immediate consequences. The popes
          Innocent, Zosimus, and Boniface (401-422) energetically opposed
          the teaching of Pelagius, and the emperor, Honorius, supported
          them by issuing a rescript (Apr. 30, 418) threatening banishment
          to every Pelagian. The suppression of the heresy in the empire
          was thus due to the civil power. But the arm of the emperor did
          not reach to Britain and in 429 Pope Celestine could only send
          Germanus of Auxerre thither to eradicate the heresy by moral
          suasion. Later all connection between the Celtic Church and Rome
          was broken for 150 years by a double and threefold wall of
          barbarians--Burgundians, Visigoths, Franks, and Saxons. The
          development of the Western Church during all this time left no
          impress on the Celtic; and local conditions could not fail to
          influence the latter. This explains how a Columban of Luxeuil
          presumes to address the pope in a way which two hundred years
          earlier would not have been remarkable in a bishop of North
          Africa or Alexandria. It explains why the Welsh Church of the
          sixth century knew only of independent bishops without
          metropolitan; the British Church in 400 knew nothing of this
          institution. The difference in the date of Easter is due to the
          fact that in 600 the Celtic Church still used the older
          supputatio Romana, which had been followed by Rome till 343, but
          was then superseded by the younger supputatio Romana. Other
          changes--the paschal table of Zeitz in 447, the nineteen-year
          cycle of Victorius in 501, the cycle of Dionysius about
          550--were all unknown to the Celtic Church.

  2. Consecration by a Single Bishop.

          The representatives of Britain at the Synod of Arles subscribed
          the canon that when possible seven and in any case three,
          bishops should take part in the consecration of a bishop. Yet
          consecration could be performed by a single bishop in both the
          British and Irish Churches long after their contact with Rome.
          This is not as surprising as it has been thought (cf. Warren,
          pp. 68-69). In the nature of things, particularly in the earlier
          period, consecration often had to be by one bishop if it took
          place at all. Gregory the Great recognized the necessity and
          gave Augustine permission to consecrate alone with the remark,
          "Since you are the only bishop in the English Church you can not
          ordain otherwise than without other bishops" (Bede, i. 27).
          Boniface V. gave the same permission to Justus, Augustine's
          third successor, "when the occasion made it necessary" (Bede,
          ii. 8). Custom with the English makes law without specific
          enactment. Hence it is comprehensible how consecration by a
          single bishop became first established usage and then law.

  3. Monastic Character of the Irish Church.

          In respect to the markedly monastic character of the Irish
          Church and the position of the bishop in it unlike that in the
          Western Church, it must be noted that in the older monasteries
          (such as Armagh in the North and Emly in Tipperary) the abbots
          were also bishops; that is, the heads of the dioceses were
          abbots and bishops in one person, but their power of church
          government rested on their position as abbots. This is explained
          by the political and social conditions of the Celts and the time
          and manner of their conversion. The first step was the
          establishment of a monastic missionary station with a clan. A
          member of the chief's family inevitably became the head of such
          a station. In some cases the right of succession to the abbacy
          remained hereditary in the chief's family for centuries. The
          necessity for some one to perform episcopal functions would not
          be felt immediately. When it did arise an original lay abbot may
          have received consecration, but, living as he did far from the
          sight and influence of an episcopal church, it was only natural
          that he should continue to perform the duties of church
          government in the church of the clan by virtue of his position
          as abbot and member of the chief's family.

  4. The Celtic and Roman Spirit.

          It is not advisable to attempt a complete picture of the
          doctrines and institutions of the Celtic Church in its prime.
          The material at hand is not sufficient, although it is adequate
          to support the conclusion that the Celtic Church of the sixth
          and seventh centuries was a reproduction of the Western Church
          of the fourth century, modified only in special points. An
          important difference, however, must be noted. The spirit of the
          Roman and Celtic Churches when they first came in conflict was
          not the same. The representatives of the former were intolerant
          and uncharitable, as Augustine toward the British bishops (Bede,
          ii. 2), Wilfrid toward Colman (ib. iii. 25), Aldhelm in his
          letter to Geraint (MGH, Epist., iii. 231-235). The Irish, on the
          other hand, such as Columban on the Continent and Aidan and the
          rest in Northumbria, only asked that they be allowed quietly to
          follow the customs of their fathers. As soon, however, as an
          Irishman went over to the Roman party a new spirit entered into
          him. Ronan, an Irishman who had been in Gaul and Italy, began
          the quarrel in Northumbria with the gentle Finan (Bede, iii.
          25). Cummian in his famous letter expresses the pious wish that
          God would "strike" Fintan (his chief opponent) "as he would"
          (col. 977b), although four or five years earlier he had himself
          kept Easter at the Celtic date. Again, the spirit of deliberate
          falsification to serve church interests does not appear in the
          Irish Church before its contact with Rome. That it appears
          immediately thereafter is abundantly shown by the history of the
          Patrick legend.

  5. Relics.

          Lastly, the new spirit which begins to pervade the Irish Church
          in the seventh century is indicated by the unprecedented
          extension of the cult of relics. Ireland had no martyrs. There
          is no reason to believe that relics were known or honored in any
          part of the Irish Church before contact with Rome. In 633 the
          embassy sent to Rome because of the Easter contest (see above,
          p. 475) returned laden with books and relics. And the next year
          Cummian writes to Seghine: "And we have proof that the virtue of
          God is in the relics of holy martyrs and the writings which they
          have brought. We have seen with our own eyes a girl totally
          blind open her eyes before these relics and a paralytic walk and
          many demons cast out" (col. 978b). Everything here, even to the
          wording (reliquiæ), is Roman, not Irish. Muirchu
          Maccu-Machtheni's life of Patrick witnesses the progress of the
          cult of relics in South Ireland during the seventh century.
          Speaking for his own time (before 697), the author mentions with
          emphasis that in three different places in the Roman-Irish
          territory relics are worshiped and he even makes Patrick
          prophesy such worship (Tripartite Life, ii. 281, II. 1-2; 283,
          II. 3-5; 497, II. 14-19). To Adamnan, writing his life of
          Columba in North Ireland at the same time and before he had
          joined the Roman party, relics are utterly unknown. But no
          sooner did Roman influence find entrance in the North through
          the yielding of Armagh (697) and Iona (716) on the Easter
          question than the same change of attitude took place which had
          occurred seventy years earlier in the South. The Annals of
          Ulster give much information on the history of the Church, but
          in the sixth and seventh centuries they contain not a single
          entry respecting relics. In 726, however, occurs the first of a
          long series of entries recording the transference or enshrining
          of relics, and a little later Armagh exhibited at the great
          fairs of Ireland the relics of Patrick, supposed to have been
          found at Downpatrick in 733, and took them to Connaught and
          Munster.

          Enough has been said to show that the spirit which animated the
          Celtic Church about 600 was quite different from that which the
          emissaries of the Roman Church brought to the British Isles.
          Both had the same dogmas. But on the one side was a striving
          after individual freedom and personal Christianity, on the other
          side a bigoted zeal for rigid uniformity and systematizing. The
          Celt emphasized a Christianity manifesting itself in word and
          deed, the Roman Catholic valued a formal Christianity above all
          else. As has been said, there is no reason to believe that the
          Celtic Church greatly resembled the Apostolic Church in
          institutions or doctrines. But the practical results of its
          teaching as seen in the life of such men as Aidan and Finan (cf.
          Bede, iii. 17) unquestionably come nearer the popular conception
          of the Apostolic Age than does the spirit manifested by the
          representatives of Rome.

          Tigernach (d. 1088). Since the sources upon which they are based
          are all lost, and the sources themselves appear in part to have
          been compilations of the eighth, ninth, and tenth centuries from
          older monastic annals, it is clear that statements concerning
          Irish church history of the fifth century have no decisive value
          when they coincide with the views concerning the earlier period
          current after 750. In using the collections of Welsh and of
          Irish Laws (Ancient Laws and Institutes of Wales, London, 1841;
          Ancient Laws of Ireland, 6 vols., Dublin, 1865-1902) it must be
          remembered that the former dates from the tenth century and the
          latter can not be much older. Other sources are: the Stowe

          The father of Celtic church history was Archbishop Ussher, whose
          work, Britannicarum ecclesiarum antiquitates, Dublin, 1639; 2d
          ed., enlarged, London, 1687, however, has now only historic
          interest. The monograph of C. Schöll, De ecclesiasticæ Britonum
          Scotorumque historiæ fontibus, Berlin and London, 1851, and the
          introduction and notes of Reeves's Adamnan, u.s., were pioneer
          work in the critical investigation and appreciation of the
          sources; it is to be regretted that not all their successors
          have continued in the same spirit. The legends of the Celtic
          Church are briefly but fully told in Cardinal Newman's Life of
          St. Augustine, chaps. i.-v., London, 1845. Works dealing with

          Cemeteries is a term used to designate the burial-places of the
          early Christians, including the subterranean burying-grounds
          commonly known as catacombs.

I. Names Used in Early Times.

          Among the various titles by which the Christians of the first
          few centuries designated the burial-places of their dead, the
          most frequent and probably the oldest is the Greek koimeterion
          or the equivalent Latin cæmeterium. It is not found in the
          Septuagint or in the New Testament, but the verb koimasthai, "to
          lie down to rest," "to sleep," occurs in both the literal and
          the metaphorical sense, usually the latter in the New Testament
          (metaphorical: Matt. xxvii. 52; Acts vii. 60, xiii. 36; I Cor.
          vii. 39, xv. 6, 18, 20, 51; I Thess. iv. 13; II Peter iii. 4;
          literal: Matt. xxviii. 13; Luke xxii. 45; Acts xii. 6). While
          the word koimeterion is of rare occurrence in classical Greek
          (it was applied by the Cretans, according to Athenæus, to a room
          for the entertainment of guests), it was constantly used by both
          Christians and Jews for single and family graves and for larger
          burying-grounds, whether above ground or under ground. On the
          other hand, there is only one doubtful case of its use in a
          heathen inscription for a burial-place (CIL, viii. 7543),
          against thousands in which other terms are used. That the
          expression was recognized as a distinctly Christian and Jewish
          term is evident from the way in which it is used as an
          unfamiliar term in the edicts of the Roman emperors (Eusebius,
          Hist. eccl., VII. xi. 13). Latin-speaking Christians also
          occasionally employed the term accubitorium, which originally
          meant (from the Roman habit of reclining at table) a
          dining-room. These words show their connection with the
          Christian hope, which saw in death only a sleep. Besides these
          specifically Christian expressions, the inscriptions give a
          number of others, of a more general nature. Besides some of
          minor importance, there is, for example, hypogæum (or in one
          place Gk. katagaion) to designate small underground
          burial-places among both Christians and pagans. Modern scholars
          frequently employ this term to designate underground
          burial-places, no matter what their size or arrangements. The
          word area is also found among the Latin-speaking races,
          especially in North Africa, and it has become customary,
          following De Rossi, to use it for all surface burying-grounds of
          the primitive Church. The name "catacomb" is more recent than
          any of the above named, but has come into more general use to
          designate not only the subterranean burial-places of the
          primitive Christians but frequently also those of the Jews and
          other races. It is first met with in connection with the circus
          of Maxentius near the Appian Way outside of Rome, in an
          inscription which has the phrase fecit et circum in catecumbas.
          As relating to a Christian burial-place, it is not demonstrable
          before the year 354, when it appears as a specific designation
          of the cemetery of St. Sebastian on the Appian Way, to which it
          was limited for centuries. Johannes Diaconus is the earliest
          evidence for its application to other Christian cemeteries,
          outside of Rome as well as within. Familiar as the word now is,
          however, there is no certainty as to its original signification.
          The most probable theory is that of De Waal, followed by
          Schultze, that the circus of Maxentius and the cemetery of St.
          Sebastian were called in catacumbas (Gk. kata kumbas, "in the
          ravine") because of the sudden dip which the land, including the
          Appian Way, takes at that point into a deep hollow.

II. Christian Burial and Burial-Places in General.

  1. Fundamental Ideas.

          The burial of Christ in the garden was taken as the model for
          that of his disciples. The fact that never in the oldest
          Christian literature (including the New Testament) and not often
          later is a prohibition of cremation found, and the absence of
          traces of cremation, cinerary urns, and the like, demonstrate
          that burial in the earth was the unwritten law. Based originally
          upon the example of Christ, it was supported later by reasoning
          which connected the resurrection of the body more or less with
          its burial. Minucius Felix, however, prefers burial to cremation
          merely as "the older and better custom" (Octavius, xxxiv. 11).
          Augustine (De civitate Dei, i. 22; De cura pro mortuis, iii.,
          etc.) takes burial for granted, and so does Origen in the East
          (Contra Celsum, v. 23, viii. 49; De principiis, ii. 10). It is
          impossible to decide how far Christians of the Apostolic Age
          were buried in Jewish and pagan graveyards; but later a strict
          line of demarcation was drawn, at least as early as Tertullian.
          The Christian graves were not required to be at a great
          distance, but there was to be a distinct interval between them
          and the heathen, and the burial of individual Christians in
          heathen graveyards was strictly forbidden, and vice versa.
          Primitive Christianity was thus as exclusive in death as in its
          worship during life.

  2. Predecessors of the Cemeteries.

          While Christian antiquity agreed in condemning cremation, it
          made no attempt at enforcing uniformity in the manner of burial.
          Both of the earlier methods of sepulture, under and above the
          ground, were employed. The choice between the two was determined
          partly by the geological conformation of the place, though
          perhaps not as largely as has been usually assumed. Other
          prevailing reasons are to be sought in the customs of
          pre-Christian times in regard to the disposal of corpses. That
          the early Christians should have undertaken, in the absence of
          any definite prescription, to strike out wholly new lines for
          themselves in this matter is unlikely, especially since they did
          not attempt this in the analogous matter of the construction of
          their houses and churches. Naturally, therefore, they adopted in
          each place the prevailing local custom--the Hebrew Christians of
          Palestine following the Jewish mode, and the Gentile Christians
          of Sicily that of their pagan neighbors. The fuller our
          knowledge grows of both ancient Christian and ancient pagan
          burial-places, the more clearly is this theory demonstrated, not
          only in regard to the choice mentioned above, but equally in
          regard to the shape, decoration, and equipment of the
          sepulchers. Thus it may be remarked, without anticipating too
          much what will be said later, that private vaults, holding but a
          small number of bodies, are characteristic of the earliest
          period of Christian burial. As far as inscriptions and other
          indications go, these were restricted to the members of one
          family, its friends, etc., with, it is true, the addition (as in
          the familia of the imperial period) of Christian freedmen and
          their Christian offspring. It is not yet certain whether so
          early as this (on the analogy of the older Roman and later
          Christian custom) individuals joined together in associations
          for the purpose of providing a common burial-place. In a word,
          it is safe to say that the primitive Christians followed Jewish
          models in Palestine and pagan elsewhere, almost without
          exception.

  3. Development of Cemeteries and Their Types.

          As in other things, so here Christianity proved itself a
          religion of development; and, once more following the general
          rule, this development was more rapid in the West than in the
          East. To take but a single important point, the development from
          the family vault to the general cemetery, the East never went
          beyond a few experiments, and burying-grounds for the whole of a
          local church remained exceptional, even at a much later period.
          The West, on the other hand, while it began with the family
          vault, and examples of this form persist through the whole of
          Christian antiquity, was not long in adopting the large common
          cemetery. The development was not everywhere equally rapid;
          Sicily was least affected by it, and Rome most. By the third
          century the common cemetery was the rule here.

    1. Origin of the General Cemetery.

          The Roman catacombs mark the highest point reached in the
          development of ancient Christian burial, the greatest and most
          speedy advance upon its pre-Christian prototypes and upon its
          own beginnings. The most striking feature of this is not the
          immense extent attained by the wonderful underground city, but
          the motive power which created it--the spirit of brotherly love
          and esprit de corps. As nearly as the obscure beginnings can be
          traced, this, rather than practical considerations or needs, was
          responsible for the vast extension of the system. Before the
          advent of Christianity, it was not uncommon for philanthropists
          to provide either individuals or whole classes, principally
          among the poor, with burial-places, and there was nothing in
          itself remarkable about Christians being inspired with the same
          benevolent idea. But the earlier instances were the product of
          mere kindness of heart, while the motive of the Christian
          benefactions was distinctly the spirit of brotherhood. The most
          famous among those who thus endowed the oldest Roman church was
          a member of the imperial family, Flavia Domitilla, who possessed
          an estate on the Via Ardeatina, of which she allowed portions to
          be used for burial. The largest common cemetery of Rome, the
          catacomb which bears her name, was constructed on this spot, and
          some of her own relations buried in it. Other Christians
          followed her example, and the Church as a whole, so renowned for
          its spirit of charity, can not have been idle in this good work.

    2. Period of the Catacombs.

          These beginnings date from the second century; the third is the
          great epoch of subterranean burial in Rome; and the new
          development ceased there first, as it had begun there. It is
          true that new catacombs were established in the fourth century,
          such as that of St. Felix on the Via Aurelia, but their number
          and extent were comparatively insignificant. Burial on the
          surface, previously rare, increased in frequency with the
          cessation of persecution, and by the beginning of the fifth
          century became the rule. The dated inscriptions give an accurate
          view of the change: if their proportion may be taken, one-third
          of the burials between 338 and 360, half between 304 and 369,
          two-thirds between 373 and 400, and after 450 all those who died
          were buried outside the catacombs. This striking change is not
          sufficiently explained by the recognition of Christianity; the
          decisive change does not coincide with the date of the Edict of
          Milan (313), and both in Sicily and in Palestine burial
          continued to be as before--in the former on the surface, in the
          latter underground. It may perhaps be better taken as merely an
          expression of the general consciousness of the change in the
          Church's position during the century, corresponding to the
          change which has been noticed in the ideal portrait of Christ in
          the same period (see [879]Jesus Christ, Pictures and Images of).

          After the Roman catacombs ceased to be burial-places, they were
          by no means deserted, but remained the destination of pious
          pilgrimages. The veneration of the martyrs and their relics
          received a great extension in the fourth century, and the use of
          the ancient burial-places in this way was furthered by the
          restoration of the passages and chambers and the opening of new
          approaches by Pope Damasus. A number of fifth and sixth-century
          popes followed his example. The old chambers were enlarged into
          chapels, or regular basilicas were established in the catacombs
          (Sant' Agnete, San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, Santi Nereo ed
          Achilleo).

    3. Burial in Mausoleums and Churches.

          While burial either in catacombs or in the open ground was the
          common practise of primitive Christianity, it sometimes took
          place in mausoleums or churches. The construction of churches to
          mark the sepulchers of the martyrs and render them accessible to
          large numbers of the faithful began soon after the recognition
          of Christianity. In churches of this kind burial was practised,
          either by graves dug in the earth or by sarcophagi. The
          principal churches used in this way in Rome were those of St.
          Peter and St. Paul, St. Laurence and St. Agnes without the
          Walls, and St. Pancreas, in and around which large numbers of
          Christians were buried until late in the sixth century. If in
          the first three centuries the Christians had respected the civil
          ordinance which required burial outside the walls of cities, the
          fourth witnessed a tendency to break down these restrictions. In
          Constantinople this took place about 381; in the mean while the
          relics of martyrs had been translated to the churches within the
          city, and promoted the desire of others to be buried in their
          neighborhood, so that an imperial edict was required which
          strictly prohibited such intramural burial. Chrysostom, however,
          who had sanctioned this restriction, was himself buried in a
          church in Constantinople in 438, and near him a number of
          persons of prominence. The increasing prevalence of the practise
          gradually broke through the law; in Rome there were intramural
          burial-places in the sixth century--a cemetery on the Esquiline
          and a number of places in and around the churches of the city,
          though the solemn translation of the relics of martyrs from the
          cemeteries outside to the city churches did not begin till the
          eighth and ninth centuries.

  4. Establishment and Administration of Cemeteries.

    1. Fossores.

          The same spirit of love which watched over not only the poor and
          the sick but also the dead in the primitive Church must have had
          before it the problem of the setting apart of definite officers
          for the care of this part of its work. It seems probable that as
          early as Cyprian's day special persons were officially charged
          with the care of funerals. Where vaults were hewn out of the
          rock or built up in masonry, special grave-diggers were not
          required; but the laying out of the larger catacombs required
          the services of technical knowledge. Thus it happens that next
          to nothing is heard about the organizers of cemeteries before
          the reign of Constantine, and in and after that reign more in
          the East than in the West. The Roman Church had no special
          officials in the middle of the second century, but at Cirta in
          North Africa as early as the beginning of the persecution of
          Diocletian fossores appear as the lowest of the clerical orders
          (see [880]Fossarians). Accordingly they came to be reckoned
          among the clerics between 250 and 350. Outside of Africa the
          fossores are sometimes named before the ostiarii. Their function
          was to dig the graves and act as custodians of the cemeteries.
          In the catacombs there are a number of pictures which show them
          at their work; here they are evidently of a higher class than
          mere laborers. In view of the complicated nature of their task,
          they are rather to be compared with architects. They seem to
          have been supported at first, like other church officials, from
          the free-will offerings of the faithful; but a number of fourth
          and fifth-century inscriptions imply that they received
          considerable sums from the sale of graves. This sort of traffic
          probably led to abuses, and so ultimately to the decline of the
          order as an order. It seems to have been definitely suppressed
          in Rome in the first half of the fifth century. Constantinople
          also had its official grave-diggers, though here they were not
          reckoned among the clergy. As a class established by Constantine
          and added to by Anastasius, they attended to burials without
          charge, but received immunity from taxation and other
          privileges, so that their position was a desirable one, and
          coveted even by well-to-do tradesmen. It is learned from Ambrose
          (MPL, xvii. 745) that in the church of Milan the whole charge of
          burials was in the hands of the clergy, but he gives no details.

    2. Administrative Officials.

          Earlier and fuller information is extant in regard to the
          officials who had the administration of the cemeteries. With the
          development from private vaults to burial-grounds for the whole
          local church, this naturally came within the bishop's sphere of
          influence. He would of course deputize some of his clergy to
          assist him, and in Rome from the third century the names of such
          clerics appear as administrators of the common burying-ground;
          the first who can be positively identified was in deacon's
          orders. The Liber pontificalis, in its account of Pope Dionysius
          (259-268), implies that each of the titular or parish churches
          of Rome had one cemetery specially assigned to it, and that the
          priest of each church had the oversight of the corresponding
          cemetery. At the beginning of the fourth century, the growth of
          the local church required an enlargement of the number, and a
          redistribution was made (again according to the Liber
          pontificalis) by Pope Marcellus (308-309). Assistants of the
          parish priest in this matter were those called from the end of
          the fifth century præpositi, who had charge of the more
          important cemeteries, and the mansionarii, who had charge of the
          less important burial-places. The præpositi of the catacomb of
          St. Calixtus, which was not classed with the others, and of St.
          Peter's, St. Paul's, and St. Laurence's, were subject not to
          parish priests but directly to the pope.

  5. Acquisition, Use, and Protection of Graves.

    1. Purchase of Grave.

          In Christian antiquity graves were acquired and prepared as in
          pre-Christian times, either by purchase or gift, and in the
          lifetime of the destined occupant or at death. People provided
          their relatives, friends, and servants with graves by their
          wills or by deed of gift. The only innovation is that which has
          been already remarked, that local churches provided
          burial-places for the poor out of the common funds. Both single
          graves and family vaults were frequently purchased, and the
          records of the transaction sometimes occupy more space than the
          funeral inscription proper, giving the names of buyer, seller,
          and witnesses, the price and location of the grave. In some of
          the Roman inscriptions, probably relating only to particular
          churches, the permission of the pope is mentioned. In cases
          where the purchase-price is mentioned, though it may have
          included the cost of construction, it seems in some instances to
          be excessive, and the fossores are likely to have driven a good
          bargain, especially for places near the tombs of the martyrs,
          for which there was an increasing demand. Gregory the Great set
          his face against the selling of graves, but after his death the
          system seems to have revived. Though the question can not be
          positively decided, it seems that in Christian antiquity the
          practise of providing a burial-place during life was more common
          in the East than in the West, and during the period after
          Constantine than that before.

    2. The Same Grave Used for Several Bodies.

          A passage in Tertullian (De anima, li.) and the decrees of
          certain councils against the crowding of bodies on top of one
          another or close together has led many archeologists to believe
          that in the primitive Church each Christian had a grave to
          himself. But this view is untenable, as is shown especially by
          the excavations of Paolo Orsi in the cemeteries of Sicily, where
          he frequently found more than one body in a grave, and in one
          case as many as eighteen. Even in Rome, where more respect was
          pad to the dead, the inscriptions not seldom show that an old
          grave was used again for fresh interments, the original tablet
          being reversed and made to bear the name of the new tenant. The
          practise seems to have originated and to have been carried on
          with the least scruple in the East, where as early as the third
          century measures had to be taken against the violators of
          graves, not merely those who opened them for the purpose of
          interring more corpses, but some even who did not shrink from
          robbing them.

    3. Violation of Graves.

          The custom of putting an inscription on a tomb to guard it from
          profanation is very old, and on the other hand was common in the
          Middle Ages. The Christian inscriptions of this kind warn those
          who read them most frequently and expressly against the use of
          the grave for burial by unauthorized persons; but the writings
          of fourth-century Fathers and the edicts of Christian emperors
          in the same period show that this was not the only danger
          feared. Gregory Nazianzen has left more than eighty epigrams
          directed against grave-robbers, and John Chrysostom was obliged
          to scourge this abuse again and again in his sermons. A
          startling fact is that the Christian inscriptions affixed to
          graves as a protection seem to be addressed mainly to
          Christians, if one may judge from their appeals to God and the
          last judgment. In all the principal sections of the ancient
          Church numerous inscriptions are found which threaten violators
          of tombs either with secular or with divine penalties, or with
          both; but they are nowhere so numerous as in Phrygia and the
          adjoining provinces of Asia Minor. This frequency may be
          explained partly by the open and comparatively unprotected
          nature of the cemeteries there, although such inscriptions are
          found also in the Roman and Sicilian catacombs; but it is
          probably due more largely to the pre-Christian tradition in Asia
          Minor, where pagan inscriptions of the kind were very
          numerous--while in Rome, on the other hand, they are equally
          rare, among pagans and Christians. Secular rulers imposed heavy
          penalties upon violators of graves; they were excluded from
          profiting by the usual Easter indulgences, and their wives were
          allowed to get a divorce from them. Nor was the Church
          behindhand in warning and punishing offenders. But the evil was
          so deeply rooted that in spite of all these measures it lasted
          much longer than Christian antiquity.

  6. Commemoration of the Dead in the Cemeteries.

    1. Various Commemorations.

          Besides the solemnities of interment, the primitive Church had a
          number of arrangements for the subsequent commemoration of the
          dead. The earliest recorded is the annual commemoration at the
          grave of Polycarp on the day of his martyrdom (Martyrium
          Polycarpi, xviii.). In the time of Tertullian it was customary
          in Africa to celebrate the anniversary of the death of other
          Christians (De corona, iii.; De monogamia, x.; cf. also
          Apostolic Constitutions, viii. 42; Cyprian, Epist., xxxix. 3).
          Other commemorations took place on the third, seventh, ninth,
          thirtieth, and fortieth days after death or burial. As has been
          seen in regard to the mode of burial, so here also these
          variations may be referred to the influence of pre-Christian
          local customs, whether Jewish or pagan. Thus Ambrose (De obitu
          Theodosii, iii.) ascribes the celebration of the thirtieth day
          to the example of Deut. xxxiv. 8 and of the fortieth to Gen. l.
          3; and Augustine (Quæstiones in Heptateuchum, i. 172) shows the
          pagan origin of the ninth by objecting to it as reminding people
          of the Roman novendial and being without Biblical precedent.

    2. Ceremonies of Commemoration.

          The place of these commemorations is not always mentioned in the
          early authorities. Those described in the Martyrium Polycarpi
          and the early Gnostic Acta Joannis took place at the sepulcher.
          What may be inferred from the latter to have been the practise
          of the Christians of Asia Minor is shown by Tertullian and
          Cyprian to have prevailed also in Africa--the celebration of the
          Eucharist in connection with these observances. By this sacred
          feast, which consolingly united the living with those who had
          gone before, the memorial ceremonies acquired a specifically
          Christian character. Later it came to be surrounded a number of
          other ceremonies. Of these the first to come up was a meal, not
          the ancient agape but one partaken of in the ordinary way as
          simple nourishment. These feasts on the anniversaries of the
          saints led to abuses and excesses which are frequently rebuked
          by the Fathers, especially in Africa, but also at Milan and in
          Rome. Offenses not merely against temperance but against
          morality seem to have taken place on these occasions in the
          East, according to Chrysostom, and also at the beginning of the
          fourth century in Spain, where a council legislates against
          them. In fact, the influence of the pagan dies parentales and
          femoralia continued to be felt, as was clearly the view of
          Ambrose and Augustine when they endeavored to regulate such
          customs, and especially to abolish anything which could seem
          like the heathen custom of offering food and drink to the dead
          (Augustine, De moribus ecclesiæ catholicæ, i. 34; Confessiones,
          vi. 2; and a canon of the Second Synod of Tours, 567). These
          authorities, however, do not raise any objection to other
          survivals of pre-Christian customs, such as the offering of
          balsam and other sweet-smelling spices, which were frequently
          poured into the grave in liquid form, through specially prepared
          openings such as are still to be seen in one of Orsi's
          discoveries in the catacombs of Syracuse, and at San Paolo fuori
          le Mura in Rome. Incense was also used. It was a common practise
          to deck the graves with flowers, and lights were sometimes
          burned, though this was forbidden by the Synod of Elvira on the
          singular ground that "the spirits of the saints are not to be
          disturbed." This custom is evidenced by the large numbers of
          small lamps found in the catacombs, either placed in niches or
          fastened to the walls, which can hardly have been intended
          merely for lighting the dark passages.

III. Arrangement, Structure, and Grave-Formation of the Cemeteries.

          In the consideration of these points, the geographical division
          is evidently the right one; but lack of space will allow it to
          be carried out only in the description of the subterranean
          burial-places, while a generic classification will have to be
          adopted for those above ground.

  1.a. Subterranean Burial-Places--The Oriental Group (Asia Minor, the Crimea,
  Lower Egypt, and Cyrenaica):

    1. Palestine.

          Palestine is rich in tombs hollowed out of the rock, more or
          less reminding the beholder of the sepulcher of Abraham (Gen.
          xxiii., xxv. 9). There has not been sufficient scientific
          investigation into their origin and age to enable an accurate
          distinction to be drawn between Jewish and Christian tombs in
          the individual instances. Either naturally perpendicular or
          artificially filled-out walls of rock were dug into
          horizontally, or, where such were difficult of attainment, an
          excavation was made downward in suitable rocky ground, into
          which a flight of steps or a ladder led down. Places for single
          or family graves were excavated horizontally, with a low and
          narrow door to each, closed with a stone, often cylindrical in
          form. In the single graves a sort of niche, or sometimes two,
          were chiseled out, at the base of which, on the semblance of a
          couch, the corpse was laid, wrapped in cloths without a coffin.
          A variant or development of this was the hollowed-out grave,
          corresponding to the arcosolium of the Roman catacombs, allowing
          the body to be laid in an excavation resembling a coffin. The
          best-known single graves in Palestine are those called the tombs
          of Absalom and of Zechariah at Jerusalem and a number of tombs
          on the south side of the Valley of Hinnom. The family tombs
          present the same forms, and later frequent instances are found
          of another kind, in which the excavation in the walls is shaped
          so as to allow the body to be pushed in head or feet foremost;
          of these a large number have been found in Palestine. This
          latter class may be taken to be exclusively Jewish in origin,
          and, where they are found in connection with indisputably
          Christian graves, it is commonly assumed that the Christians
          merely appropriated them. There is no doubt that the Jewish
          Christians also used the hollowed-out and the vertically sunk
          graves. An interesting burial-place with the latter type of
          grave is that on the Mount of Olives, which in more than one
          particular differs from the normal arrangement in Palestine, and
          probably belongs to a comparatively late period of Christian
          antiquity. Elsewhere in the country, even down to the fifth and
          sixth centuries, the original character of both single and
          family tombs was preserved.

    2. Syria.

          Syria offers a considerable number both of ancient church
          buildings and of ancient cemeteries, both above and below
          ground, and a type which is a combination of the two, at once
          hollowed out in the rock and built over above. The openings to
          the subterranean burial-places are either vertical or
          horizontal. In the former case they are covered by a stone like
          the lid of a sarcophagus, or sometimes by a roof with columns or
          a complete chamber; in the latter, a door leads directly into
          them by a flight of steps, or one passes first through a portico
          or anteroom. The inner space, usually rectangular, has in most
          cases two or three hollowed-out and vaulted graves, each along
          one wall; six is the largest number cited by De Vogüé. The
          coffin-shaped place for the body is generally covered, not by a
          slab, but by a heavy stone shaped like the arched
          sarcophagus-lids. The principal difference between the known
          Christian burial-places of Syria (mostly fifth century, to judge
          from the inscriptions) and their pagan prototypes is the almost
          universal choice of the arcosolium form among those used in
          pre-Christian times.

    3. Mesopotamia.

          The cemeteries of Mesopotamia seem to correspond in their main
          features to those of central Syria, including structures wholly
          or partially above ground and excavations in the rock. An
          important necropolis is that outside the walls of Constantina in
          northern Mesopotamia, above ground, containing nearly 2,000
          graves. The subterranean burial-places seem to have been mostly
          connected with ancient stone-quarries, and some of them are more
          extensive than the similar ones in Syria, though numerous
          smaller ones have been found.

    4. Asia Minor.

          The best-known early Christian cemeteries in Asia Minor are in
          the extreme southeastern provinces of Isauria and Cilicia, of
          which the former had the good fortune to be explored by L.
          Duchesne. Near the ancient Seleucia (now Selefkeh) are numerous
          rectangular chambers at irregular distances from each other,
          excavated in soft limestone and entered by doors. They contain
          from three to ten graves apiece, somewhat like arcosolia, but
          standing out further from the walls. Rock-chambers and isolated
          arcosolia are also found near the village of Libas, and many
          isolated coffins were scattered around three basilicas at Mout,
          the ancient Claudiopolis, as well as graves dug straight down
          and covered with stone slabs. Anazarbe in Cilicia has a large
          necropolis dating from a late period of Christian antiquity, in
          which both rock-chambers and rock-coffins are found, as also at
          Elæussa. A still larger cemetery was probably that of Corykos
          (now Ghorigos), where chambers are excavated in the rock;
          sometimes in several lines one above another. These seem to have
          been all for families or small groups. All about the neighboring
          hills are large isolated sarcophagi with saddle-back covers. In
          Pisidia, at Termessos, there are burial-chambers which the
          crosses show to have been Christian. Since Armenia has Christian
          rock-tombs at Arabissos (now Yarpuz), it is not unlikely that
          the intervening province of Cappadocia will yet furnish some
          examples. It is possible that the lack of interest hitherto
          shown in the Christian cemeteries of Asia Minor is due to the
          close resemblance between them and the pagan burial-places; and
          evidence is not lacking to support the theory that a
          considerable number which have heretofore been classed as pagan
          will, upon further investigation, be proved to be Christian.

    5. Egypt.

          Accurate modern scientific investigation of the Christian
          sepulchral remains of Egypt has borne no proportion to the
          importance of the northern part of that country in the early
          Church, and the question must be here discussed principally from
          the evidences to be found in Alexandria. Among the catacombs to
          which access was gained in the nineteenth century the best known
          is that discovered in 1858, lying near the Serapeum in the
          south-western part of the ancient city. A flight of steps leads
          down into a square anteroom, with a semi-circular niche
          adjoining it on the west side, and two burial-chambers extending
          out from it. One of these is long and narrow, vaulted above, and
          containing thirty-two tombs of the kind into which the body is
          pushed head or feet first. The other, smaller and square, has
          three hollowed-out graves, one on each side, and another sunk in
          the floor. That these were used by Christians is demonstrated by
          paintings and inscriptions, though more recent in date than the
          construction. Néroutsos, the most thorough student of the
          Alexandrian catacombs, mentions another, discovered in 1876,
          which he believes to be Christian. In this the anteroom
          resembles a Greek or Roman ædicula, though the capitals of the
          columns are decorated with lotus-flowers instead of
          acanthus-leaves. The oblong burial-chamber leading out of this
          has on three sides rows of graves of the kind described, at
          right angles with the wall, one above another, to the number of
          fifty-four. These cemeteries were probably family burial-places,
          serving for more than one generation. The pagans and Jews of
          Alexandria undoubtedly began with this system, but there is
          reason to believe that the Christians did not always adhere to
          it.

    6. Cyrenaica.

          Cyrenaica contains a great number of burial-places hollowed out
          in the rock, both pagan and Christian, especially in the old
          capital city; but they have not been explored with sufficient
          completeness and accuracy to allow the formation of definite
          conclusions. As far as can be determined, most of the
          burial-places of Cyrene are excavated in the side of
          perpendicular cliffs near the city. Only a few of them give
          positive evidence of Christian use, though there is reason to
          think that these are not all. A great variety of methods
          appears, including movable and immovable stone sarcophagi,
          arcosolia, loculi, graves sunk in the floor, and long, narrow
          holes in the cliff in which the dead were laid one above
          another, separated by horizontal slabs. The arcosolia show
          considerable artistic feeling, and where the vaulted roof occurs
          it resembles not a little the vaulting of the apse in early
          churches, like which, again, it is often painted. In these
          catacombs several chambers are sometimes united to form a larger
          whole, evidently serving for more than one family, and in one
          case it is possible to conclude with certainty that it was a
          common burial-place for the Christian community. In this
          particular alone the Christians of Cyrenaica developed beyond
          their predecessors' whom they followed only in the variety of
          shapes used for the graves.

  1.b. Subterannean Burial Places--The Western Group.

    1. North Africa.

          Even if the assumption frequently made that there were no
          subterranean cemeteries in North Africa is abandoned, it is
          true, at least, that they have but little significance compared
          with the large number in the open air or in and near buildings
          above ground. There seem really to be but two subterranean
          burial-places to consider. One at Tipasa has ten adjoining
          chambers dug out of the rock of the foot-hills. The chamber,
          trapezoid in form, approximately ten feet by nine, has an
          arcosolium on each of three sides and three graves dug in the
          floor, apparently covered with flat slabs. Gavault, its
          discoverer, compares it with some chambers in the Roman
          catacombs, but it is more analogous to the Oriental and
          Sicilian. The other cemetery, discovered in 1885, is at
          Arch-Zara. The accessible portion is elliptical in shape,
          terminating in a sort of apse. Four parallel passages, the
          longest about eighty-eight yards, crossed by others at right
          angles, are found in it. In the walls of these galleries are
          placed loculi, closed by slabs of brick. It is quite possible
          that the place extends further in, or even that there is a
          second level below the one which has been excavated.

    2. Sicily.

          The cemeteries of Sicily surpass in number those of any other
          province of the Roman Empire, and show more varied forms than
          even Rome itself can offer. Each of the races which successively
          ruled the island brought its own customs with it, while none was
          strong enough to enforce them to the exclusion of the old. In
          dealing with the problem of sepulture, Christianity had a number
          of methods, both aboriginal and mixed, to choose from, and
          needed only to adopt or adapt. Nor was it limited to Sicilian
          types; the many ties which connected the island, even in
          Christian times, with Asia Minor, Syria, Egypt, North Africa,
          and Rome rendered it possible for still other architectural
          types to find an entrance. The geological formation of the
          island favored the excavation of subterranean burial-places.
          Limestone and tufa abound, the latter usually of firmer
          substance than the tufa granulare of the neighborhood of Rome.

          The first stage in the development is formed by the family
          vaults, of which the simplest show a square, oblong, or
          trapezoid form with graves in the walls, usually of the
          arcosolium or loculus type. Next, the small vault developed into
          a hall, from which recesses ran off on each side, usually shaped
          like a bell or a flower-pot, though sometimes square, with an
          opening at the top for light and air. Structures based upon
          older cisterns are confined to the vicinity of Girgenti, and
          tombs with a baldachin covering, to eastern Sicily and Malta.
          Some of these stand free from the walls with the covering
          supported by pillars on all sides, like the ciborium of an
          altar; others are supported from one side on pillars, and from
          the other connect with the wall. In the eastern part are some
          with decorative facades in front either of a single grave or of
          a group, furnished with doors and windows.

          The main differences in structure depend upon the size of the
          cemetery. The galleries of the larger catacombs were laid out
          with one or more main alleys and a number of smaller ones
          running across or parallel to them. The passages are as a rule
          comparatively wide, much wider than in Rome. Occupying an
          intermediate position between passages and chambers are the
          recesses, as wide as or wider than the corridors, but shorter.
          These are met with frequently in Sicily, and often contain
          (besides other types of graves) sarcophagi, sometimes arranged
          in terraces. Where chambers occur in the large catacombs, they
          are connected with the galleries, and are in shape square,
          oblong, trapezoid, or circular, the last being especially
          preferred in the principal catacombs of Syracuse. The
          rectangular ones have either a flat or a vaulted roof, the
          circular are often covered with a cupola, with an opening in the
          top for light and air. Where the size was sufficiently great to
          admit the possibility of a fall of the roof, this was guarded
          against by the construction of pillars out of the solid rock or
          by the erection of columns. The corridors and chambers are
          sometimes all on one level, sometimes in different stories.

          The variety of grave-forms is even greater than that of the
          general structure. In most places the commonest type is the
          arcosolium, sometimes double, one above another. Single graves
          are found relatively seldom; usually several occur in a row (up
          to fifteen or even more) under the same vaulted roof. In Sicily
          loculi are much less common than arcosolia, and where they are
          numerous certain corridors contain them almost exclusively for
          children. The "table-tomb" and the grave at right angles with
          the wall are rare. Sarcophagi, on the other head, were common,
          either cut out of the natural stone, built up with masonwork, or
          made of better material, such as marble; and so were graves sunk
          in the floor of chambers, recesses, and galleries, to the extent
          of forming a characteristic of the Sicilian cemeteries. The most
          important of all the Sicilian catacombs was that of San Giovanni
          near Syracuse, which in extent and skilful laying out surpasses
          even the Roman.

    3. Malta.

          In Malta most of the ancient cemeteries lie near the capital, in
          the neighborhood of Carthaginian burial-places. Where the sides
          of rocky cliffs were accessible, the excavations were
          horizontal, vertical in the flat country. Some of these have
          nothing but galleries, others nothing but chambers. As a rule,
          the galleries are few and short, their height that of a man.
          Among the grave-forms is one which so far has not been found
          outside of Malta, known for convenience as the "oven-grave."
          This is an opening in the wall at a greater or less distance
          from the floor, with the bottom and sides straight, and the top
          in the shape of either an arch or a shell, or sometimes
          straight. These external parts are carefully constructed and
          decorated, often with pilasters in the front; at the back is a
          rectangular opening which gives access to the length of a grave
          usually for two, less often for one or three bodies. These
          graves are generally arranged in a row; in the catacomb of
          Tal-Liebru there are two rows, one above the other. This
          peculiar form can hardly be of Christian origin, but is rather,
          as Mayr has shown, the development of a type used by the
          Phenician population of the island. In a number of burial-places
          it is the only form used, in others it appears concurrently with
          the more usual types, among which the arcosolium is the most
          frequent. Both in the oven-graves and in the others a headrest
          with a semicircular depression is common. The Maltese
          cemeteries, most of which date from the fourth and fifth
          centuries, are as a rule small, and must have served for
          families or other small groups. Only a single catacomb is known
          on the neighboring island of Gozzo.

    4. Melos.

          Near the village of Trypiti in Melos, surrounded by pagan tombs,
          is a Christian necropolis unquestionably used as early as the
          fourth century, composed originally of five separate catacombs,
          four of which were afterward connected; and it is probable that
          others still lie concealed in the vicinity. The oldest, that in
          the middle, consists of a broad main gallery and several side
          corridors. The width of the galleries varies from 3 ft. 3 in. to
          16 ft. 4 in., the height from 4 ft. 7 in. to 7 ft. 6 in. The
          walls contain arcosolia with semicircular arches and a few
          loculi, and there are graves sunk in the floor of all the
          passages, usually in pairs. The three undoubtedly Christian
          catacombs have no chambers, but the other two, which are
          probably Christian, have them. Bayet counted 150 arcosolia and
          sixty-six sunk graves in the whole five.

    5. Apulia.

          Far as Melos and Apulia are from each other, it would be
          difficult to find a closer affinity between types of catacombs
          than exists between these just described and those of Venosa, of
          which the one most fully studied is apparently of Jewish origin.
          Here again one finds the same unusual breadth of galleries, in
          spite of the friable nature of the tufa, the arcosolium is the
          predominant form, at least in the main galleries, and the floor
          is full of sunk graves, while chambers are once more lacking.
          The principal difference is in the form of the arcosolia, which
          in Melos are of only one kind, in Venosa of several, answering
          to the Sicilian variety; and in fact the Jewish catacomb of
          Venosa offers to a certain extent the intermediate step between
          Melos on one side and Sicily and southern Italy on the other.

    6. Naples.

          The catacombs of Naples are the most important among those of
          Campania; and of these the largest and oldest are those of San
          Gennaro dei Poveri, whose beginnings apparently go back to the
          first century. Four are enumerated nowadays; but there is reason
          to suppose that there were originally more. The oldest is
          trapezoid in ground-plan, with a maximum width of thirty-three
          feet and length somewhat more. Other smaller rooms open from it
          to left and right, the latter of which was later remodeled into
          a church. At the back of the large hall are the entrances to two
          parallel galleries nearly 100 yards long, connected by numerous
          transverse passages. From the outer side of each of these
          stretch out other chambers and galleries, which in their turn
          ramify still further, though to a much less extent than in the
          Roman catacombs. The second catacomb is less important, and the
          other two still leas. They exhibit three types of
          graves--arcosolia, loculi, and sunk graves. The first are the
          most numerous in the halls and chambers, as well as in the
          oldest and most important galleries; unlike the Roman, but like
          those of Melos and Sicily, they are sometimes in two rows, one
          above the other. From the irregular disposition of the loculi,
          which look as if they had been crowded in, it is safe to
          attribute a later date to them. They form, however, an actual
          majority of the total number of graves.

    7. Castellamare.

          At Castellamare there is a later but not uninteresting catacomb,
          named after St. Blasius. Besides a nearly square entrance-hall,
          it contains a main gallery nearly twenty-two yards long, with an
          average breadth of 9 ft. 10 in., lined with arcosolia. On the
          left of it three side galleries branch out, and at its further
          end is a chamber from which further galleries continue. The
          weight of evidence is in favor of a Christian origin. The
          arrangement of the graves in the chambers at Castellamare and
          Sorrento is peculiar; they are placed in rows one above another
          so as to resemble a honeycomb, a form which is lacking in the
          older catacombs, though it is impossible to say whether it
          originated with the Christians of these places.

    8. Rome.

          The history of the immense and widely known catacombs of Rome
          begins, as is the case elsewhere, with the family plot. In the
          first two centuries, and even later, individual Christians
          picked out places for the interment of themselves and their
          families, including in some cases their freed-men. The
          arrangement of the first cemeteries is not demonstrably derived
          from pagan models, since there were many Jews in Rome and in the
          primitive Church there, and these also buried their dead in
          subterranean cemeteries. But there is reason to believe that,
          while it would be too much to say that Jewish traditions had no
          influence on the early development, the first beginnings of the
          Christian burial system in Rome were derived rather from pagan
          prototypes.

          With the extension of the family plot into the common cemetery
          for the faithful, underground Rome became apparently a
          labyrinth, though really its plan is more simple and
          intelligible than that of some of the larger catacombs outside
          of Rome. Since the ground was either flat or slightly rolling,
          the excavation was begun by digging down at an angle into the
          earth, the descent being furnished with steps, usually covered
          with brick or marble. After it had reached the required depth
          (averaging about twenty feet), the excavation continued
          horizontally in a main gallery and others roughly parallel with
          it, connected by cross passages into a regular network. The dead
          were interred usually in the walls, less often in the floor of
          the passages. Here and there, at the side, end, or intersection
          of passages, doors were cut which led to one or more chambers
          (cubicula). The shape of these was as a rule nearly rectangular,
          less often polygonal, semicircular, or circular; the roof nearly
          or quite flat or cross-vaulted in the rectangular ones, and of
          the nature of a cupola in the polygonal or circular. The later
          catacombs usually have smaller chambers, sometimes not more than
          about four square yards in extent.

          As to the form of the tombs, the loculus here is the most
          frequent, larger than necessary in the oldest cases, but later
          closely following the shape of the body. Sometimes they were dug
          in deep enough to afford room for several bodies. Above the
          arcosolia there was usually a nearly or quite semicircular arch.
          If two bodies were to be buried together in these, a loculus was
          cut at the back of the hollowed-out apace, or sometimes the arch
          was carried further back and two spaces hollowed out side by
          side; or again loculi were cut, especially for children, in the
          lunette of the arch. A combination of the loculus and the
          arcosolium is the so-called loculus a mensa or "table-tomb." The
          grave dug in the floor is found less often than in southern
          Italy and Sicily, and most of those which exist probably date
          from a time when the walls were already full. Sarcophagi were
          also used, made of marble in most cases; these were placed
          mostly in the cubicula and galleries, but sometimes on the side
          of the stairs. When the wall-space of a catacomb was filled, the
          fossores gained more room by digging the floor of the passages
          deeper. When this had gone so far as to threaten the stability
          of the walls, a second shaft or gallery was begun at a downward
          angle from the first, and the whole process repeated. Thus in
          the catacombs of St. Calixtus and St. Domitilla five different
          levels are found, the lowest more than eighty feet beneath the
          surface. An approximate conception of the vast extent of the
          Roman catacombs may be gained from the calculations of Michele
          Stefano de Rossi and of Marchi. The former estimated the total
          length of the passages at 550 miles, the latter at 750. The
          number of bodies buried there is variously given as from three
          and a half to six millions.

          The catacombs of the towns around Rome and in Etruria resemble
          the Roman, it is true, more than the Sicilian; but there are
          striking differences, as in the typical ones of Bolsena, Chiusi,
          and Soriano, which, when examined in detail, lead to the
          conclusion that the influence of the ancient Etruscan
          burial-customs had much to do with them. It extended, in fact,
          very nearly to the gates of Rome, and some of its
          characteristics are found in the catacombs of Rignano and at the
          twentieth milestone on the Via Flaminia.

  2.a. Cemeteries Above Ground--Plan and Construction:

    1. In the Open Air.

          The simplest form of cemeteries in the open air is found in
          Upper Egypt, where, in order, to save the soil available for
          agriculture and at the same time to protect the graves from
          inundation, the Christians laid their dead to rest on the border
          of the desert, in large cemeteries used by a considerable
          district. They seldom used wooden coffins, but tied the corpse,
          mummified with asphalt or natron, to a sycamore board, then
          wrapped cloths around it and buried it in an ordinary grave.

          The discovery in 1873 of a cemetery dating from the fourth and
          fifth centuries at Portogruaro, the ancient Julia Concordia,
          gives an accurate idea of other vanished burying-grounds,
          especially in northern Italy. Several hundred sarcophagi of
          Istrian limestone rest either directly on the ground or on large
          square bases. They are carved out of a single block of stone,
          usually without anything on their sides except inscriptions, and
          covered with heavy roof-shaped covers. The cemeteries of Arles,
          Vienna, and Treves were similarly laid out. At Arles five layers
          of graves ultimately existed, one above another, separated only
          by a layer of earth--the lowest heathen, the upper ones
          Christian. Much the same was the arrangement at Vienna and at
          Treves, except that in the latter there are both sarcophagi and
          graves lined with masonry or brick and covered with slabs of
          brick, limestone, or sandstone. Here again the lowest layer
          contains a number of pagan inscriptions and sarcophagi, the most
          probable inference being that the Christians in Gaul and the
          Rhine country occupied former pagan burial-places. The areæ of
          northern Africa attained a certain celebrity even during the
          epoch of persecution, and were carefully investigated by French
          scholars during the nineteenth century. One at Lambése, about
          sixty-five by fifty-three yards in extent, was surrounded by a
          slight wall, and apparently contained nothing but ordinary
          graves. Elsewhere, in addition to these, small vaulted
          structures were erected over the bodies, as at Cæsarea (modern
          Cherchel) in Mauretania. Two important open-air cemeteries
          existed at Tipasa; in the center of one was a basilica erected
          over the body of the martyr Salsa.

    2. Memorial Buildings.

          The word "mausoleum," now usually restricted to large and
          imposing monuments, was used in ancient times for less important
          tombs, and memoria is also frequently employed. These small
          memorial buildings have mostly disappeared. They must have been
          particularly numerous in regions where the small family
          burial-place was the rule, and where the custom of erecting them
          had been prevalent in pre-Christian times. Syria and Mesopotamia
          have supplied a considerable proportion of them, and Asia Minor
          probably had as many; but they existed also in countries where
          the common burying-ground was the rule. Some stood among graves
          in the open air, as above the Catacomb of St. Calixtus in Rome;
          others near or attached to churches, as at Tipasa and two that
          adjoined the old St. Peter's in Rome; others, again, were
          isolated, like the tomb of Galla Placidia and that of Theodoric
          at Ravenna.

    3. Ground-Plan and Form.

          The frequency of nearly or quite rectangular grave-chambers in
          the underground cemeteries would lead to the expectation of
          finding the same structure above ground; and as a matter of fact
          it is the rule in Syria and Mesopotamia, while the early
          existence of numerous examples of this class may be inferred
          from paintings and sculptures representing the raising of
          Lazarus, which nearly always depict an oblong tomb like a house
          or temple. Actual examples from the West are one built like a
          tower above the Catacomb of St. Calixtus in Rome, another
          vaulted one at Tropea, two adjoining ones by the side of a
          basilica at Morsott, and another at Tipasa in North Africa.
          Occasionally to the rectangular ground-plan was added a
          semicircular termination at the rear, as in the group of tombs
          in the cemetery of Manastirine near Salona, of the fourth
          century or earlier, and other examples at Tipasa and Ancona. The
          rotunda shape, however, was also of frequent occurrence from the
          earliest times. Two large mausoleums of this shape, Santa
          Petronilla and Santa Maria della Febbre, stand near St. Peter's
          in Rome, and the church of St. George at Salonica was probably
          sepulchral in origin. The tomb of Theodoric at Ravenna is
          externally a decagon, on the ground floor within a Greek cross,
          and circular above. After semicircular additions to an original
          rectangular plan became common, suggesting the form of a cross,
          the idea received further development at the hands of
          Christians. The most prominent representative of this was the
          mausoleum of the first Christian emperors, the church of the
          Apostles at Constantinople, of whose sumptuous structure,
          unhappily, little more is known now than that it had the shape
          of a Greek cross. The tomb of Galla Placidia at Ravenna also
          deserves study from this point of view. Probably earlier than
          the time of Constantine is the original construction of the two
          mausoleums above the catacombs of St. Calixtus, which later
          received the names of St. Sixtus and St. Soter.

    4. Cemeteries Connected with Churches.

          When, after the cessation of persecution, the erection of
          churches over or near the graves of the saints was carried out
          on a large scale, the development of cemeteries in connection
          with them followed as a consequence of the desire of Christians
          to be buried near the resting-place of the martyrs. In spite of
          the ancient law forbidding burial within the walls of the city,
          such burials continued after the relics of the martyrs were
          brought in to the principal churches of various places (see
          [881]Church-Yard). Burial within the church itself was not
          everywhere approved. In Spain and Gaul, particularly, it was
          even a subject of adverse conciliar legislation, although this
          barrier did not suffice to keep back the flowing tide of popular
          piety. Both literary and monumental evidence attests the
          existence in the most widely separated portions of the primitive
          Church of buildings used both for worship and for interment. A
          large number of them arose outside the walls of Rome.
          Unfortunately many smaller buildings of this class sank into
          decay or oblivion during and after the Middle Ages, while the
          larger ones were so transformed in course of time that to-day
          they have scarcely a trace of their original use. It is thus
          easier to examine the extant ruins in order to form an idea of
          the construction adopted in the first instance. Of these
          undoubtedly the most significant is that discovered and explored
          by Delattre at Damous-el-Karita near Carthage. Here, in the
          church proper and atrium as well as in the immediate
          neighborhood, more than 14,000 inscriptions or fragments of
          inscriptions were brought to light. The dead were buried in
          ordinary sunk graves, lined and covered with slabs, though some
          were constructed of masonry, frequently covered with stone
          slabs, and a number of sarcophagi were founds these latter sunk
          flush with the floor. Of the great burial-churches in Rome, the
          best example was until recently furnished by that of Santi Nereo
          ed Achilleo, the floor of which was literally crowded with
          graves and sarcophagi. The church of St. Paul without the Walls,
          also at Rome, which from the fourth century was a favorite
          burial-place, was surrounded by a space intended especially for
          interment, covered by a roof supported on columns, and adorned
          with paintings; and that of St. Balbina, also outside the city,
          had a teglata under which the dead were buried.

  2.b. Cemeteries Above Ground--Types of Graves.

    1. The Ordinary Grave.

          In the primitive age, the simple grave dug in the earth was the
          commonest form for cemeteries above ground. It was ordinarily
          not so deep as the graves of to-day, and was frequently lined
          with slabs of stone, with brick, or with masonry. This custom
          led to the enlargement of the simple grave into a vault capable
          of holding several bodies. Of these vaults none have been so
          thoroughly investigated as were these of the upper cemetery of
          St. Calixtus and the churches of St. Laurence and St. Paul
          without the Walls by De Rossi. In the first-named large holes
          were dug, and then divided off by partitions into spaces each
          large enough for one body. The materials used in construction
          were tufa, brick, marble, and thick layers of mortar. In these
          compartments the corpses were placed one above another, a slab
          covering the one first buried and serving as a support for the
          next. The place of the slab was occasionally taken by an arched
          covering of brick or by a layer of masonry. In this particular
          cemetery the excavation was carried deep enough to contain ten
          or even more bodies thus superimposed; the average is between
          eight and nine. The same system is found at Ostia, Porto, and
          Tropea in Calabria, as well as in North Africa and at Athens. In
          other cases, as in the same cemetery of St. Calixtus, the
          corpses were laid side by side and separated by an upright slab.
          While the usual shape of all these graves was rectangular, some
          occur in North Africa which correspond roughly to the shape of
          the body, and are rounded off at the head and foot. They were
          frequently also wider at the head than at the foot, giving a
          bell-shaped type which corresponds to examples found in the
          Sicilian catacombs. In both cases this type is a survival of
          native pre-Christian usage.

    2. The Covering of the Grave.

          The closing of the graves, whichever of these forms they took,
          was done in various ways. In Upper Egypt commonly, but elsewhere
          as well, the earth removed in excavation was heaped over the
          grave. In other cases slabs were laid either flat on the ground
          or on the top of the sides where an artificial lining was placed
          in the grave. These slabs were frequently decorated in the fifth
          century with mosaic, including an inscription and various
          pictorial representations, sometimes the portrait of the
          deceased or symbolic designs. Instead of slabs, large heavy
          stones cut into a rough shape were used in some places,
          especially in the East, and in North Africa, where it was an
          inheritance from Carthaginian custom.

    3. Sarcophagi.

          The term sarcophagus was originally used by the ancients in
          connection with a kind of stone found near Assos in Asia Minor,
          which was supposed to have the property of consuming the flesh
          of the corpse in a short time (Pliny, Hist. nat., XXXVI. xvii.
          27), but it was often employed for receptacles made out of other
          stone. The early Christians, taking over both name and things,
          used the stone they found at hand. For relief decorations,
          however, the porous and often flawed limestone was ill adapted,
          and marble was generally selected where these were desired. The
          most usual form was that of a parallelepiped, hollowed out to
          receive the body. The shape of the body was sometimes partially
          reproduced on the outside, especially in North Africa, or at
          least the head was semicircular; while at Rome the head and foot
          were alike. Sarcophagi for children seldom occur, because they
          were usually buried with their parents in the larger ones. When
          more than one body was to be placed in the same sarcophagus,
          stone partitions were sometimes placed in the interior.
          Christian sarcophagi were frequently adorned with more or less
          elaborate decorations, usually in relief, though the taste of
          the North African Christians for mosaic led them to employ it in
          some cases.

    4. Other receptacles.

          Wooden coffins were also used, either enclosed in the sarcophagi
          or buried in the earth; but on account of their perishable
          material they have almost disappeared. A coffin of cypress was
          found in the marble sarcophagus of St. Cecilia, and Gsell found
          others of oak and pine in sarcophagi at Tipasa. A plain
          rectangular chest of cedar, but richly decorated with plates of
          gold and silver, received the remains of St. Paulinus at Treves,
          and was afterward enclosed in a large sandstone sarcophagus.
          Coffins of lead were also known; but the most peculiar
          receptacles were those in the shape of an amphora or large
          water-vessel. These easily held the corpses of little children;
          when they were used for full-grown persons, they were sometimes
          taken apart and lengthened by the addition of cylindrical pieces
          taken from other amphoræ, and then cemented together.

IV. Equipment and Decoration of Tombs.

          Corresponding to the great variety of arrangement and structure
          noticed above is a still greater wealth of objects pertaining to
          the equipment and decoration of the resting-places of the dead.
          Many of these objects seem natural and intelligible to-day, but
          others appear peculiar, especially the provision of household
          utensils. The furnishing of tombs with inscriptions and with
          painted or carved images is but an inheritance of the traditions
          of earlier civilized peoples, especially the Greeks and Romans;
          and it seems on the face of it not unlikely that the provision
          of these various other objects was similarly a following of
          ancient custom. It is indisputable that these pre-Christian
          peoples regarded the grave as a house, and gave it corresponding
          arrangements and decorations. Roman tombs sometimes accurately
          resemble dwelling-houses, with atrium, triclinia, and the like.
          Numerous pagan inscriptions designate either a burial-vault or a
          single grave as a house, the eternal house, etc. These same
          designations and an analogous form of construction are not
          uncommon in early Christian usage, as might be shown, did space
          permit, from monuments, inscriptions, and the writings of the
          Fathers. This conception of the grave as a house offers the only
          satisfactory explanation of what would otherwise be so
          mysterious, the character of the objects in the tombs as gifts
          to the dead. In themselves unnecessary if not senseless
          additions, they merely demonstrate the power of long custom,
          from which even medieval Christianity was not able wholly to
          emancipate itself.

  1.a. The Grave Itself--The Interior.

    1. Objects Pertaining to the Corpse.

          Proper clothing for the corpse was universal, no matter what
          form of grave was used. Even those who died of the plague in
          Alexandria had their seemly vesture (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., vii.
          22). Linen seems to have been the usual material, and white the
          color, though costly stuffs, such as silk and purple and gold
          brocade were sometimes used. Ambrose, Chrysostom, and Jerome
          protested against the use of gold-embroidered garments, and the
          first and last also against silk. At a later period synods even
          found it necessary to legislate against luxury in grave-clothes,
          e.g., that of Auxerre in 578. In the same century Gregory of
          Tours relates that a kinswoman of King Childebert was buried
          "with great ornaments and much gold," which, however, were soon
          stolen. The indications thus given in the literature of the
          period are confirmed by numerous discoveries, the largest number
          of which have been in Upper Egypt. Here the garments are mostly
          of linen, less often of pure wool or silk. As to mere ornaments,
          though Gregory of Nyassa says that the body of his sister
          Macrina was stripped before burial of rings and necklaces, the
          discoveries show that this was not the common practise. On the
          contrary, the number of such objects found leads to the
          conclusion that many bodies were more richly adorned in death
          than in life. Among them are rings, earrings, bracelets and
          anklets, necklaces, combs and hairpins, fibulæ, etc., made of
          various materials and frequently bearing Christian emblems, such
          as the monogram of Christ, the Good Shepherd, the dove, fish,
          and cross. With these ornaments it is easy to confuse the
          amulets sometimes found, since many of them were made in the
          shape of rings, bracelets, or pendants for the neck (see
          [882]Amulet).

    2. Disposition of the Corpse.

          Where the grave-diggers of the catacombs, or the stone-cutters
          who made sarcophagi, designed the space for the corpse, as was
          often the case, so that its head was higher than its feet, there
          was no need for any support for the head But in other cases such
          supports were placed in the tomb, the most primitive sort being
          of one or more stones. In Upper Egypt rich leather cushions
          stuffed with tow have been found, so sumptuously decorated as to
          deserve the name of works of art. Vessels of clay served the
          same purpose in North Africa. Sometimes supports were provided
          for the whole body--in North Africa a layer of beton, here and
          elsewhere simple arrangements of flat bricks, in Catania
          perforated brick supports on low feet, like benches. On sanitary
          grounds the grave was often lined with unslacked lime, which was
          also sprinkled over the corpse. Traces of this custom have been
          found in the Roman catacombs and elsewhere, as in North Africa.
          The dead were also laid in some places on a bed of laurel
          leaves.

    3. Gifts to the Dead.

          While the Christians of the primitive age usually contemned the
          use of perfumed oils and waters, they used such things for the
          dead in considerable quantities. The dead were anointed before
          they were dressed for burial, and then sprinkled with perfumes
          or regularly embalmed with spices, though this latter practise
          seems to have been comparatively rare in Rome. Anything like
          mummifying was still more uncommon, outside of Egypt. Usually
          cloths wet with perfumes were laid upon the body, especially the
          face, and vessels of the most diverse shapes filled with
          perfumery were set near it. It is practically certain that some
          of the vessels known as [883]Ampullæ contained these perfumes,
          and others wine. As food and drink were set out for the martyrs
          and other saints at the commemorative feasts, it is safe to say
          that this took place also at burials. There is also the
          often-discussed possibility that such vessels contained the
          elements of the Eucharist, or at least the consecrated wine, in
          connection with the practice condemned at the Third Council of
          Carthage and often later, of making the dead partakers in the
          communion.

          Another class is formed by the large number of domestic utensils
          of every sort which have been found in the graves. These
          comprise vessels of all kinds, mostly of clay but sometimes of
          glass or more costly materials, knives, forks, spoons,
          writing-tablets, styluses, ink-stands, hammers, nails,
          spinning-wheels, chisels, and tools of many different kinds.
          Other objects of daily use pertain less to mere utility than to
          luxury and adornment. A varied collection of articles such as
          served the women of those days for the toilet have been
          discovered in and near the tombs of the catacombs, made of
          metal, mosaic, ivory, glass, enamel, and mother-of-pearl. The
          grave being conceived, in a certain sense, as the house or
          chamber of the departed, there is nothing surprising in the
          discovery that parents, for example, placed near the bodies of
          the children they had lost even the trifles which had been dear
          to them in life--dolls, small figures of men and animals, small
          lamps, spoons, etc., savings-banks, and ivory letters of the
          kind used in the schools. Even things relating to the amusements
          of grown-up people--boards for games, dice, and the like--are
          occasionally found. Pieces of money are of frequent occurrence.
          Since there is evidence that the old pagan custom of providing
          the dead with money to pay Charon for the ferriage persisted
          among Christians in Greece and elsewhere, there is no doubt that
          at least some of these coins were placed there from that point
          of view.

  1.b. The Grave Itself--The Exterior.

    1. Vessels for lights and Incense.

          After the burial was finished, it was a common practise to fix
          in the still wet mortar with which the loculi and arcosolia of
          the subterranean cemeteries were closed small vessels, usually
          of glass, sometimes shells, for the same purpose as the vessels
          inside the grave. A repeated renewal of these is evidenced by
          the tomb of one Peregrina (d. 452) in the Catacomb of San
          Giovanni at Syracuse, several glasses must have been broken and
          replaced, and there was also a clay censer still containing
          coals and some grains of intense. The lamps similarly affixed to
          the outside of the graves were intended to be lighted at the
          funeral and on memorial days. Semicircular niches were made in
          the adjacent walls to hold them. From the reign of Constantine
          the lamps burning at the graves of the martyrs were kept up with
          special reverence; the oil from them was credited with
          miraculous power, and pilgrims often took a small quantity of it
          home with them.

    2. Marks of Identification.

          Many of the objects mentioned above ([884]a, § 3) are found
          embedded in the mortar outside the graves, sometimes as gifts,
          but in other cases undoubtedly as means of identification among
          the thousands of graves in the large catacombs, the majority of
          which had no inscriptions, possibly owing to the poverty of the
          survivors. Some of these substitutes for the regular incised
          blocks of marble or other stone are letters, numbers, etc.,
          embedded or scratched in or above the place where the tomb is
          closed; others are small objects of great variety, rings,
          buttons, glasses, bits of mosaic, animals' teeth, shells, coins,
          stones of fruit and leaves of plants, fixed in the mortar before
          it dried.

    3. Inscriptions and Paintings.

          In their use of sepulchral inscriptions the early Christians
          merely continued the tradition of still older civilizations.
          Outside of the family vaults, on or over the door of which the
          name of the occupants or owners appeared, the inscriptions were
          placed on or at least near the graves. The most peculiar
          exception to the general usage is formed by those which have the
          inscriptions inside the graves, where they can not have been
          visible to passers-by. Karl Schmidt discovered a number of
          inscribed gravestones in the necropolis of Antinoe in Egypt
          which seemed to have been laid originally well down in the
          graves, at the foot, with the writing underneath. The
          inscriptions were either cut with a chisel or other sharp tool,
          scratched with a sharp point, painted with a brush, or composed
          in mosaic. These inscriptions offer most trustworthy and
          striking evidence of the mode of thought, faith, and hope of the
          primitive Christians, especially in regard to death, the grave,
          and the resurrection (see [885]Inscriptions; [886]Painting).

  2. The Chambers and Passages.

          In these the presence has already been noted of tables, benches,
          and chairs for the observance of the commemorations of the dead.
          The dimensions of such tables as have been discovered imply that
          the number of participants was small. While such furniture is
          practically absent from the Roman Catacombs, where wood must
          accordingly have been used, several tables of more durable
          material have been found in North African burial-places. The
          galleries and chambers of the catacombs also contained
          receptacles for the materials used in mixing mortar for closing
          up the tombs. Those which have been preserved, made usually of
          clay, with incrustations of mortar and lime still upon them, may
          have been used either for this purpose or on sanitary grounds,
          to counteract the effluvia of the place. Lighting arrangements
          are found here too, although the galleries must have been in
          comparative darkness, to judge from the way in which Jerome
          quotes Ps. lv. 15 and Vergil, Æneid, ii. 755 in connection with
          the memory of his visit to the Roman Catacombs. As the arcosolia
          were frequently ornamented with paintings in their vaults and
          lunettes, and the loculi on their exterior side, so also the
          chambers and less frequently the galleries of the catacombs were
          decorated in the same way. No doubt the structures above ground
          connected with the cemeteries were painted in much more numerous
          cases than the scanty remains extant at the present day would
          lead one to suppose.

   Censer or Thurible
          CENSER OR THURIBLE: The vessel in which incense is burned during
          divine service in the Eastern, Roman Catholic, and of late years
          many Anglican churches. The usual shape is that of a small metal
          bowl, with a base on which to stand it when not in use, and
          fitting over it a high conical cover in which are perforations
          to let the smoke out. The whole is carried by three chains, on
          which the cover slides up and down, when it is raised to allow
          incense to be thrown upon the live coals contained in the lower
          part. In connection with the censer another smaller vessel,
          called the incense boat, is used to carry the supply of incense;
          as its name implies, it is shaped like a small boat, but with a
          lid and a base on which to stand it.

   Censorship and Prohibition of Books
          CENSORSHIP AND PROHIBITION OF BOOKS: By censorship is meant the
          provision that no publication shall be issued without
          preliminary examination and permission by the authorities,
          either ecclesiastical or secular. The prohibition of books as
          dangerous to religion, to morals, or to the State dates back to
          an early period.

    Early Instances.

          Thus all works on magic were ordered to be destroyed by the
          later Roman Empire. Constantine issued an edict that the works
          of Arius should be burned, and numerous like edicts against
          books of other heretics followed. Those who used or possessed
          such books were threatened with death. The Church forbade, on
          its own account, the reading of pagan and heretical books
          (Apostolic Constitutions, i. 6, vi. 16; canon xvi. of the
          Council of Carthage, 398). During the Middle Ages, both Church
          and State adhered firmly to the same principles; a salient
          instance is the decree of the Council of Constance against the
          writings of John Huss and its execution.

    Censorship by the Church.

          After the printing-press was invented and used to advance the
          cause of the Reformation, measures for its regulation were
          introduced by the Church, which first established a formal
          censorship of books. In a letter addressed to the archbishops of
          Cologne, Mainz, Treves, and Magdeburg, Alexander VI. ordered
          (1501) that no book should be printed without special
          authorization. The Lateran Council of 1515 sanctioned the
          constitution of Leo X., which provided that no book should be
          printed without having been examined in Rome by the papal vicar
          and the master of the sacred palace, in other countries by the
          bishop of the diocese or his deputy and the inquisitor of
          heresies. Further and more detailed legislation followed, and
          the Council of Trent decreed (session iv.): "It shall not be
          lawful to print, or cause to be printed, any books relating to
          religion without the name of the author; neither shall any one
          hereafter sell any such books, or even retain them in his
          possession, unless they have been first examined and approved by
          the ordinary, on pain of anathema and the pecuniary fine imposed
          by the canon of the recent Lateran Council." On these
          regulations are based a number of enactments in different
          dioceses which are still in force. The Council decreed also that
          no theological book should be printed without first receiving
          the approbation of the bishop of the diocese; and this rule is
          extended in the monastic orders so far as to require the
          permission of superiors for the publication of a book on any
          subject.

    Present Practise.

          The Council of Trent left the further provision concerning the
          whole subject to a special commission, which was to report to
          the pope. In accordance with its findings, Pius IV. promulgated
          the rule submitted to him and a list of prohibited books in the
          constitution Dominici gregis custodiæ of Mar. 24, 1564.
          Extensions and expositions of this ruling were issued by Clement
          VIII., Sixtus V., Alexander VII., and other popes. The present
          practise is based upon the constitution Sollicita ac provida of
          Benedict XIV. (July 10, 1753). The maintenance and extension of
          the Index librorum prohibitorum was entrusted to a special
          standing committee of cardinals, the Congregation of the Index
          (see [887]Curia), which from time to time publishes new editions
          (the latest, Turin, 1895). There is also an Index librorum
          expurgatorum, containing books which are tolerated after the
          excision of certain passages, and another librorum
          expurgandorum, of those which are still in need of such partial
          expurgation. The prohibition to read or possess books thus
          forbidden is binding upon all Roman Catholics, though in special
          cases dispensations from it may be obtained. The most recent
          regulation of the whole matter was made by the bull Officiorum
          ac munerum of Leo XIII., Jan. 25, 1897.

          The State in many cases for its own purposes approved the
          principle of censorship until comparatively recent times. In
          Germany it was abolished only in 1848. In England after the
          Reformation the licensing power was in the hands of the
          archbishop of Canterbury; after Milton's famous onslaught upon
          it in the Areopagitica (1643), it came to an end by the refusal
          of the House of Commons in 1695 to renew the Licensing Act. The
          Reformed Church of Germany maintained similar regulations in
          some places, where the synodal form of organization prevailed.
          Among the Lutherans, the matter was as a rule left in the hands
          of the State.

          Census is a term used to designate an enumeration of the people,
          generally for purposes of taxation or for service in the army.

  [I. In the Old Testament.

          Of censuses of the whole population there are recorded in the
          Old Testament ten cases: (1-2) under Moses (Ex. xxxviii. 26, cf.
          Num. i.; Num. xxvi.); (3) under David (II Sam. xxiv. 1-9; see
          [888]David); (4) under Solomon (II Chron. ii. 17-18); (5) under
          Rehoboam (I Kings xii. 21); (6) under Jehoshaphat (II Chron.
          xvii. 14-19); (7) under Amaziah (II Chron. xxv. 5-6); (8) under
          Uzziah (II Chron. xxvi. 12-13); (9-10) under Zerubbabel (?) and
          Ezra (Ezra ii. 64, viii. 1-14). There are other enumerations
          given, but they concern merely the strength of the army, as in
          II Chron. xiii. 3.

  II. In the New Testament.

          The subject here is of interest principally in its relation to
          the census mentioned Luke ii. 2 and Acts v. 37, and in
          connection with the birth of Jesus.]

    1. The Roman Census of Citizens.

          Originally the Romans made a census of Roman citizens only, the
          primary object being the adjustment of their quota in the taxes
          for the costs of war. This census was intended to exhibit not
          only the pecuniary but the total effective utility of the
          individual toward the State. So it included attestation of
          personal circumstances, capacity for service, civil and
          military, and the moral worthiness of those enumerated.
          Gradually this census of Roman citizens lost significance. While
          in earlier times it was repeated every five years in connection
          with a religious festivity (lustrum), during the civil wars it
          lapsed. Augustus, it is true, consistently with his general
          policy of bringing about an ostensible restoration of the
          republican order (T. Mommsen, Römisches Staatsrecht, ii. 337,
          Leipsic, 1893), adopted the census anew. He put on record that
          he had thrice held a complete census of citizens, viz., in the
          years 29 B.C., 8 B.C., and 14 A.D. A census of this kind was
          made for the last time under the Emperor Vespasian.

    2. Provincial Census to Regulate Tribute.

          The census of the Roman provinces, introduced much later, was
          quite distinct from this census of citizens, the difference
          corresponding to that between the Roman people as conqueror and
          the provinces as conquered. Since in this light the provincial
          census was designed to regulate not the rights but the
          obligations of those enumerated, it served only to define
          military service and tribute. The forms of the latter in the
          various provinces showed great diversity. There was doubtless
          everywhere some sort of ground tax (tributum soli), usually in
          the form of a definite tribute, partly in money, partly in
          natural products, which could also be levied as communal tithes,
          except that if in case of a defective harvest the amount of the
          requisite tribute was not realized, the tithes were made good
          through other taxes. The real-estate tax was everywhere
          supplemented by a personal tax (tributum capitis), which might
          be levied as a uniform capitation tax for all, or (as in Egypt)
          as a graduated poll-tax; or as property or income tax. In all
          forms, however, it was let by contract to tax farmers. These
          taxes, which in the main came down from the republican era, were
          in the earlier period regulated partly by means of a census. But
          only from the time of the government of Augustus were they
          organized on a more extensive basis. Especially in the provinces
          incorporated by Cæsar and the emperors into the Roman Empire
          were the fiscal relations thus regulated.

    3. Cases and Methods of Roman Census.

          According to literary records well known, this was done three
          times in Gaul under Augustus, then under Nero and Domitian; in
          Syria, Judea, and Spain under Augustus; among the Clitæ under
          Tiberius; in Britain under Claudius; in Dacia under Trajan.
          Besides these provinces, the following are named in inscriptions
          as subjected to a census in imperial times: Aquitania, Belgium,
          Lugdunensis, Lower Germany, Macedonia, Thrace, Paphlagonia,
          Africa, and Mauritania. In the republican era the administration
          of these provincial censuses had been combined with the office
          of provincial governor; but in imperial times it was transferred
          to the emperor. Augustus personally executed this office in
          Gaul, in other cases the emperor was represented by men of the
          highest rank; for entire provinces, as a rule, persons of
          senatorial station were appointed; for smaller districts,
          knights. At the outset in the imperial provinces, the census was
          delegated only occasionally (Mommsen, ut sup., ii. 410, a, 4) to
          the provincial governor. The essential uniformity of
          organization of taxes and assessments throughout the empire,
          such as is proved for the later imperial times by the classic
          legal sources, although no traces are apparent of a sudden
          reorganization in relation to the provinces under the earlier
          period, was early anticipated by the census regulations of
          Augustus. As to the detailed constitution of this provincial
          census, which later became universal, there is still some
          debate; it is fairly certain, however, that it regulated a real
          estate tax for proprietors and a personal tax for the landless;
          that it included the taxpayers' personal assessment; that its
          organization was not communal but provincial; and that the
          formal declaration took place in the principal centers of the
          fiscal districts. Of the interval between censuses there is
          certain knowledge only in relation to Egypt, through the new
          discoveries of Egyptian papyri (U. Wilcken, Griechische Ostraka,
          in Archiv für Papyrusforschung, vol. i., 1899), according to
          which in that country two kinds of assessments (apographai) were
          executed at stated times: a popular enumeration every fourteen
          years, and a declaration of movable property annually.

    4. Palestinian Census of 6 A.D. Quirinius.

          In Palestine, at all events, a census quite in the Roman manner
          was executed in the year 6 A.D., though only in the southern
          part of the country, which in that year came under immediate
          Roman jurisdiction. The Syrian legate Quirinius was at that time
          entrusted with the extraordinary imperial commission of
          undertaking a census not only in the newly annexed country but
          also throughout Syria (cf. also CIL, iii., supplement, no.
          6687). The vehement opposition which the regulation provoked
          among the Jewish population and especially with a faction whose
          leader was [889]Judas of Galilee shows that in that form it was
          new to the region. This census, as the mention of Judas of
          Galilee implies, is referred to in the words of Acts v. 37, "in
          the days of the enrolment."

    5. Luke ii. 2 in Error. Jesus not Born Under Quirinius.

          More difficult of solution is the other New Testament passage,
          in which mention is made of a census decreed from Rome (Luke ii.
          2). It is here distinctly stated that this census, commanded by
          Cæsar Augustus for the whole Roman Empire, was the first which
          took place in Palestine (as decreed by Augustus) when Quirinius
          was governor of Syria; and that by it Joseph was obligated to go
          with Mary to Bethlehem, his place of enrolment, where the birth
          of Jesus came to pass. From the starting-point of Acts v. 37, it
          were most plausible to bring the birth of Christ, according to
          Luke ii., down to the time of the census of the year 6 A.D. This
          is antagonized by the chronology of Luke iii. 23, also by the
          fact that both Matthew and Luke presuppose the birth of Jesus
          during the reign of Herod the Great, who died in the year 4 B.C.
          of the Dionysian era (see [890]Herod and his Family); that is,
          the birth of Christ would have occurred in the last preceding
          years. But in those years Quirinius could not have been governor
          of Syria, because Sentius Saturninus was governor in the years
          8-6B.C. (Josephus, Ant., XVI. ix. 1), and from 6 B.C. until
          after Herod's death the governor was Quintilius Varus (Josephus,
          Ant., XVII. v. 2, x. 1). It has been therefore proposed on
          exegetical grounds to set aside the synchronism between the
          governorship of Quirinius and the birth of Jesus. But these
          attempts are impossible artifices. It has also been affirmed on
          the strength of the later governorship of Quirinius in the year
          6 A.D., that he served an earlier preceding term (T. Mommsen,
          Res gestæ divi Augusti, Berlin, 1865). But the evidences of this
          are quite uncertain. And since in no case can an earlier term of
          Quirinius as governor coincide with the reign of Herod the
          Great, it would not elucidate Luke ii. 2. If it be assumed that
          the census of the year of Christ's birth was begun by
          Saturninus, continued by Varus and completed by Quirinius
          (Zumpt), against this in Luke ii. 2, the governorship of
          Quirinius is evidently intended to indicate the time when the
          event recorded there took place; and a census by a Roman officer
          in Judea before the annexation of that country is improbable.
          Accordingly Zahn assumes that only one Roman census took place
          in Palestine, namely, under Quirinius, which is meant both in
          Luke ii. and in Acts v.; save that this occurred not in the year
          6 A.D., but in the year 4 B.C., several months after the death
          of Herod. But the particularity of the data in Josephus
          contradicts this hypothesis, which at all events does not clear
          the Gospel of Luke of error. On this account it is to be assumed
          that the governorship of Quirinius, Luke ii. 2, has been
          erroneously transposed from the census of the year 6 to the year
          of Christ's birth.

    6. No General Census Under Augustus.

          Still again, the report in Luke ii. of a general Roman imperial
          census is not historically warrantable according to the literal
          text. Disregarding later untrustworthy accounts, there are no
          literary or epigraphic traces of an imperial census in the time
          of Augustus, and such an event could not have occurred without
          leaving some traces. And from the monument of Ancyra it is
          evident that Augustus did not hold a census of Roman citizens in
          the period from 8 B.C. to 14 A.D. Only in the emperor's
          financial reform projects with reference to the whole empire,
          and in the assessments held by him in many parts of the empire,
          appears a certain nucleus of truth for that statement in Luke
          ii.

    7. Solution, a Census by Herod.

          If then in the light of Luke ii. the governorship of Quirinius
          and the Roman imperial census can not be verified, this report
          is not to be rejected as unhistorical in all other respects.
          That Herod at that time received orders from Augustus to
          undertake a census in his country is not an impossibility.
          Highly as Herod was esteemed even by the emperor, he
          nevertheless remained the emperor's subject. This is manifest
          from the words of Augustus, that he would henceforth treat him
          not as his friend but as his subject (Josephus, Ant., XVI. ix.
          3); as likewise from his rating in the number of the Syrian
          procurators (Ant., XV. x. 3). Consequently, since the Jews of
          Palestine from Pompey's time forth had been obliged to pay
          tribute in various forms to the Romans, Herod was also bound to
          the payment of tribute promptly after his appointment as king
          (Appian, Bella civilia, v. 75). It is, therefore, arbitrary to
          doubt (Schürer) that he also paid such dues continually (cf.
          Wieseler, TSK, 1875, pp. 541 sqq.). Nevertheless he was not
          deprived of the right of imposing and increasing taxes in his
          own name (cf. Josephus, Ant., XV. x. 4; XVII. ii. 1, xi. 2). It
          is accordingly to be assumed that he had to furnish tribute to a
          prescribed amount at Rome the collection of which was generally
          left to him out of Jewish revenues. Where, however, the Roman
          interest required it, the emperor, as a matter of course, could
          intervene for raising the necessary taxes to make up the
          tribute. This is apparent from a similar case, wherein Augustus
          commanded Archelaus to remit one-fourth of the Samaritans' taxes
          (Josephus, Ant., XVII. xi. 4). It is then conceivable that he
          commanded Herod to regulate the taxes necessary for the Roman
          tribute by means of a census by virtue of the forms already in
          vogue. For that Augustus did not at that time order a
          specifically Roman census in Palestine, but adhered to the
          Jewish practises, is borne out by other analogies in Roman
          procedure (Tacitus, Annales, iv. 72), by the operations of the
          Roman census of the year 6 A.D., and by indications afforded by
          the Gospel of Luke, according to which the census in question
          was decreed conformably to Jewish tribal enrolments. [For reply

   Central America
          CENTRAL AMERICA: The extreme southern portion of the continent
          of North America, including seven independent states, as
          follows, enumerated in geographical order from north to south:

                                     Area. Square miles. Population.
          Colony of British Honduras 7,562               40,000
          Republic of Guatemala      46,774              1,800,000
          Republic of Honduras       42,658              775,000
          Republic of Salvador       8,130               1,000,000
          Republic of Nicaragua      51,560              400,000
          Republic of Costa Rica     23,000              331,000
          Republic of Panama         31,890              330,000

          The population is overwhelmingly Indian, negro, and mixed. In
          British Honduras in 1891 there were only 400 whites. In
          Guatemala 60 per cent of the people are Indians and 28 per cent
          mixed. About one-twentieth of the population of Salvador and
          one-fifth of that of Nicaragua are classed as white. In Costa
          Rica there are 8,000 Indians, and the remainder is almost
          entirely creole. The Indians in many localities retain their
          native language and live in almost primitive conditions; where
          classed as Roman Catholic converts their relation to the Church
          is often little more than nominal. But few of the colored
          population still persist in heathenism.

          The republic of Panama was formed by revolution from Colombia in
          1903. Religious statistics for this state are not available, but
          it may be said, in general, that conditions are the same as in
          the rest of Central America and the mother country (see
          [892]Columbia). The five older Central American republics, after
          the disruption from Spain, formed from 1821 to 1839 the "United
          States of Central America." Their present independent status was
          attained gradually, often after internal dissension and warfare.
          During the revolutionary and formative period the Church
          suffered much. Its property was confiscated, monasteries were
          abolished, monks were banished, and the secular clergy were
          persecuted. Poverty has also been a heavy burden to the Church.
          Ecclesiastical affairs were regulated by a series of concordats
          with Pope Pius IX. between 1852 and 1863 (see [893]Concordats
          and Delimiting Bulls, VI., 5).

          The religion is everywhere Roman Catholic, but toleration is now
          legally assured in all states. The diocese of Guatemala was
          founded in 1534 and raised to archiepiscopal rank in 1743. The
          suffragan bishoprics are Nicaragua (1534), Comayagua (for
          Honduras, 1561), San Salvador (1842), and San José of Costa Rica
          (1850). A vicar apostolic has resided at Belize in British
          Honduras since 1893.

          An Anglican diocese of Honduras and Central America was founded
          in 1883. The bishop resides at Belize. Guatemala has
          approximately 4,500 Protestants representing English and
          American churches and including a congregation of about 1,000
          Germans resident in the capital. Protestants in Honduras number
          about 1,000 and in Costa Rica 3,200. They are barely represented
          in Salvador. In Nicaragua are fifteen "stations" of the
          Moravians.

          All the states have public schools, colleges, and universities,
          and progress is being made in both elementary and the higher
          education. As might be expected, however, the majority of the
          population is illiterate. Attendance at the elementary schools
          is compulsory in Costa Rica, Guatemala, and Honduras.

          CEOLFRID, chOl´frid, SAINT: Abbot of Wearmouth and Jarrow; b. of
          noble parents in Northumbria c. 642; d. at Langres, France,
          while on his way to Rome, Sept. 24, 716. He became a monk at the
          age of eighteen, and was made prior by [894]Benedict Biscop of
          his new abbey of St. Peter at Wearmouth, which was begun in 674;
          accompanied Biscop to Rome in 678; became abbot of his second
          monastery founded at Jarrow in 681 or 682 (where he had Bede
          among his pupils), and in 688, abbot of both Wearmouth and
          Jarrow. He was a good manager and increased and enriched his
          monasteries, at the same time making them centers of learning
          and industry. He took special pains to learn the Roman methods
          of reading and singing the services and influenced the Irish in
          Scotland to adopt the Roman date for Easter.

   Cerdo (Cerdon)
          CERDO (CERDON): A Syrian Gnostic, who, according to Irenæus (I.
          xxvii. 1, III. iv. 3) and Eusebius (Chron., ed. Schoene, i.
          168), lived in Rome in the time of the bishop Hyginus (c.
          136-140). Epiphanius (xli. 1) connects him with Saturninus. He
          is of importance chiefly as having been the teacher of
          [895]Marcion.

   Cerinthus
          CERINTHUS: Gnostic teacher of Asia Minor, about 100 A.D.
          According to Irenæus (I. xxvi. 1), he taught that the world was
          not created by the first God, but by a subordinate power. Jesus
          was a son of Joseph and Mary, but was wiser and more righteous
          than other men. After his baptism the spirit of the all-sublime
          power of God descended upon him in the form of a dove. From now
          on he preached the unknown Father and performed miracles.
          Finally the "Christ" forsook him, but "Jesus" suffered and rose
          again, whereas the spiritual Christ did not suffer. John
          directed his Gospel especially against Cerinthus (III. xi. 1),
          and in proof of the aversion which the apostle felt toward this
          heretic Irenæus (III. iii. 4) tells a story from Polycarp that
          the two met once in the baths at Ephesus, whereupon the apostle
          fled, "lest even the bath-house fall down because Cerinthus is
          inside." In the main the story is credible, but the later story
          (cf. Epiphanius, Hær., xxviii. and others) of the Judaism of
          Cerinthus is an invention. The assertion of the Roman Caius that
          Cerinthus is the author of the Apocalypse is certainly
          erroneous.

   Cesarini, Giuliano (Julian Cesarini)
          CESARINI, chê´´s??-rî´nî, GIULIANO (JULIAN CESARINI): Cardinal.
          He belonged to a distinguished family of Rome and attracted the
          attention of the curia as a humanist and teacher of law at
          Padua. Pope Martin V. made him cardinal (1426) and Eugenius IV.
          promoted him to cardinal bishop of Frascati. His knowledge of
          law and ability as a diplomatist fitted him for delicate
          missions. The Hussite question was entrusted to him and he
          entered Bohemia with a crusading army, but the army was defeated
          and the cardinal fled ignominiously (1431). From 1431 to 1438 be
          presided at the Council of Basel with marked ability. [14] In
          1438 and 1439 he was active in Ferrara and Florence, and shortly
          after went to Hungary to incite King Vladislav to war against
          the Turks. He succeeded, and war broke out in 1443, but
          Vladislav was defeated and slain at Varna, Nov. 10, 1444, and
          Cesarini also perished while trying to escape; he was probably
          assassinated and robbed while endeavoring to cross the Danube.

   Chaderton, Laurence
          CHADERTON, LAURENCE: Puritan; b. near Oldham (8 m. n.e. of
          Manchester), Lancashire, Sept. 14, 1536 or 1538; d. at Cambridge
          Nov. 13, 1640. He studied at Christ's College, Cambridge (B.A.,
          1567; B.D., 1578; D.D., 1613), and there embraced the Protestant
          religion, for which his father threatened to disinherit him. He
          became fellow, dean, tutor, and lecturer of his college, and as
          afternoon lecturer of St. Clement's Church, Cambridge, for
          nearly fifty years acquired fame as a preacher and exerted a
          far-reaching influence. When Sir Walter Mildmay founded Emmanuel
          College in 1584 he insisted on Chaderton's becoming master, and
          the latter filled the office with much ability and success till
          1622, when he resigned. From 1598 to 1640 he was prebendary of
          Lincoln. Though a Puritan he was moderate in views and
          conciliatory in manners. He was a member of the [897]Hampton
          Court Conference, and was one of the Cambridge committee of
          Bible translators. He appears to have published nothing except
          an anonymous tract, De justificatione, and a single sermon.

   Chadwick, John White
          CHADWICK, JOHN WHITE: American Unitarian; b. at Marblehead,
          Mass., Oct. 19, 1840; d. in Brooklyn Dec. 11, 1904. His father
          was a seafaring man, and he was apprenticed to a shoe-maker. But
          in 1857 he entered the State Normal School at Bridgewater,
          Mass., and while there determined to become a minister. From the
          Normal School he passed to Phillips Exeter Academy and the
          Divinity School of Harvard University, from which latter
          institution he was graduated in 1864. He was immediately asked
          to supply for three months the pulpit of the Second Unitarian
          Church of Brooklyn, N. Y., but made so favorable an impression
          that his relation became a permanent one and he was its pastor
          at the time of his death. Besides being well known as a preacher
          and lecturer and highly esteemed as a man, he won distinction as
          an author both in prose and poetry. He described himself as a
          "radical Unitarian," but he was heard with respect by those who
          most differed from him. Besides many other contributions to the
          press, he published: Life of Nathaniel Alexander Staples
          (Boston, 1870); A Book of Poems (1876, now in its 10th ed.); The
          Bible of To-day (New York, 1878); The Faith of Reason, a Series

   Challoner, Richard
          CHALLONER, RICHARD: English Roman Catholic prelate; b. at Lewes
          (50 m. s. of London), Sussex, Sept. 29, 1691; d. in London Jan.
          12, 1781. His father was a Protestant, but died soon after his
          son's birth, and the latter was brought up by Roman Catholics
          and embraced their religion at about the age of thirteen. In
          1704 he was sent to Douai and remained there as student,
          professor, and vice-president for twenty-six years (B.D., 1719;
          D.D., 1727; ordained priest 1716). In 1730 he joined the London
          mission, and in 1741 was consecrated coadjutor to Dr. Benjamin
          Petre, vicar apostolic of the London district; he became vicar
          apostolic on Dr. Petre's death in 1758. He was a learned and
          pious man, and performed his duties with faithfulness and
          ability, in the midst of persecution from the penal laws and the
          fanaticism of the English populace. He wrote upward of forty
          different works, controversial, devotional, historical, etc. His
          Memoirs of Missionary Priests . . . and of other Catholics . . .
          that have suffered death in England on religious accounts from
          the year 1577 to 1684, (2 vols., London, 1741-42; many later
          eds.) is the Roman Catholic "Book of Martyrs"; The Garden of the
          Soul (1740) is still the most popular prayer-book with English
          Roman Catholics; and The Rheims New Testament and the Douay
          Bible, with annotations (5 vols., London, 1749-50; 3d ed.,
          revised, 1752), prepared by Challoner and under his direction,
          is the best-known version of the Douai Bible. His Life was
          written by J. Barnard (London, 1784), and by Dr. John Milner (in
          the 5th ed. of his Grounds of the Old Religion, 1798).

   Chalmers, James
          CHALMERS, JAMES: London Missionary Society missionary; b. at
          Ardrishaig, Argyleshire, Scotland (45 m. w. by n. from Glasgow),
          Aug. 4, 1841; d. at Risk Point, Goaribari Island, Gulf of Papua,
          New Guinea, April 8, 1901. Converted at the age of fourteen, he
          was soon after called to the foreign mission field and after
          study at Cheshunt College and at Highgate, an institution
          conducted by the London Missionary Society, he was sent by that
          Society to Raratonga, one of the group of Cook Islands in the
          Southern Pacific, where he arrived in 1867. The island had been
          partially Christianized, but he did a good work in education and
          evangelization. In 1877 he removed to New Guinea, where he
          encountered cannibals and did a memorable work at the constant
          risk of life. It was on one of these many journeys that he was
          killed. He takes his place beside Williams and Patterson as a
          missionary hero in the South Seas.

   Chalmers, Thomas
          CHALMERS, THOMAS: The leader of the Free Church of Scotland; b.
          in East Anstruther, Fifeshire, Mar. 17, 1780; d. in Edinburgh
          May 30, 1847. The family to which he belonged was composed of
          middle-class people of the strictest type of Calvinism; and
          hence in his opening years, he received thorough indoctrination.
          He entered St. Andrews University when only eleven years old,
          and confined his attention almost exclusively to mathematics,
          but did not give up his original intention of becoming a
          preacher, and accordingly was licensed by the presbytery of St.
          Andrews Jan., 1799. His character early developed into maturity.
          Instead of beginning his professional work, he continued the
          study of mathematics and natural science; and during the winter
          of 1802-03 he acted as assistant to the professor of mathematics
          at St. Andrews. He showed an extraordinary power to awaken
          enthusiasm in almost any topic he took up; although it was this
          very fact which at that time cost him his place, the authorities
          disliking the novelty of his methods.

    Ministry at Kilmeny.

          He settled as minister of Kilmeny, nine miles from St. Andrews,
          May, 1803, and in the following winter, while preaching
          regularly, opened voluntary and independent classes in
          mathematics at the university, which were largely attended,
          although vigorously discouraged by the authorities. He was a
          faithful pastor at Kilmeny, and his preaching attracted wide
          attention, but his heart was not in his work. He was trammeled
          by the prevailing moderatism, which put culture above piety, and
          state support above independence. In 1808 evidence of the trend
          of his thinking appeared in his Inquiry into the Extent and
          Stability of National Resources. The supply of man's physical
          and social needs was uppermost in his mind. In the midst of such
          work he was visited with severe domestic afflictions, and a
          serious illness brought him to death's door; but he recovered
          after a year. David Brewster asked him to contribute to his
          Edinburgh Encyclopedia. He at first chose "Trigonometry," but at
          length took "Christianity" (separately published, 1813). And as
          he examined the doctrines of this religion, and went deeper into
          its mysteries, he realized its importance, and by studying about
          Christianity he became a Christian. The parishioners quickly
          became aware that he had really not so much resumed his work
          among them as begun it. His whole soul was on fire, and his
          culture was now used to make the saving truth of saving power.
          He cut loose from the moorings of moderatism, and became a
          decided Evangelical. His eloquence was expended in new channels,
          and with great results.

    In Glasgow.

          In July, 1815, he was formally admitted as minister of the Tron
          Church, Glasgow. In 1816 he delivered on weekdays the famous
          series of seven Discourses on the Christian Revelation, Viewed
          in Connection with Modern Astronomy. In Sept., 1819, he removed
          from the Tron parish to that of St. John's, in order that he
          might, in a newly constituted parish, have an opportunity of
          testing the practicability in a large city of the old Scottish
          scheme of providing for the poor. In the parish there were two
          thousand families. These he distributed into twenty-five
          divisions; and over each such district he put an elder and a
          deacon--the former to attend to their spiritual, the latter to
          their temporal needs. Two commodious school-houses were built;
          four competent teachers were employed, and by school-fees of two
          and three shillings each a quarter, seven hundred children were
          educated; while on Sunday the forty or fifty local schools
          supplied religious instruction. Dr. Chalmers not only presided
          over all this system of work, but made himself familiar with all
          the details, even visiting personally every two years each
          family of the parish, and holding evening meetings. He also
          assumed complete charge of the poor; and by thorough system, and
          consequent weeding-out of unworthy cases, he reduced the cost of
          maintaining them from fourteen hundred to two hundred and eighty
          pounds per annum. This efficient system, however, in 1837 was
          given up; and the "English" plan of compulsory assessments,
          which requires much less trouble, and probably does much less
          good, was substituted. In Nov., 1823, Dr. Chalmers became
          professor of moral philosophy in St. Andrews University, and in
          Nov., 1828, professor of theology in Edinburgh. In 1833 he
          issued his Bridgewater Treatise, On the Adaptation of External
          Nature to the Moral and Intellectual Constitution of Man. This
          work made a great sensation; and his biographer, Rev. William
          Hanna, says that, in consequence, he received "literary honors
          such as were never united previously in the person of any
          Scottish ecclesiastic." In 1834 he was elected fellow of the
          Royal Society of Edinburgh, and soon after one of its
          vice-presidents, in the same year a corresponding member of the
          Institute of France; and in 1835 the University of Oxford
          conferred on him the degree of D.C.L.

    The Organization of the Free Church.

          Up to this time he had taken little part in church government;
          from then on he was destined to have more to do with it than any
          other man of the century. The friction between Church and State
          in Scotland was rapidly producing trouble. The attempt to settle
          ministers who were obnoxious to the congregations was the
          commonest complaint. [15] The historic case is that of Marnoch.
          Here only one person in the parish signed the call; and yet the
          presbytery of Strathbogie decided, by a vote of seven to three,
          to proceed with the ordination, and did, although these seven
          were suspended. In so doing they were upheld by the civil
          authority, which annulled their suspension. But this case was
          only an aggravation of a common ill. Matters became so serious
          in all parts of Scotland that a convocation was held in Nov.,
          1842, to consider the matter; and a large number of ministers
          resolved that, if relief was not afforded, they would withdraw
          from the Establishment. No help came; and accordingly, on May
          18, 1843, four hundred and seventy clergymen withdrew from the
          General Assembly, and constituted themselves into the Free
          Church of Scotland, electing Dr. Chalmers as their first
          moderator. He had foreseen the separation, and drawn up a scheme
          for the support of the outgoing ministers. But, after he had
          safely piloted the new church through the stormy waters, he gave
          himself up more exclusively to professional work, especially in
          connection with the New College, Edinburgh, of which he was
          principal, and to the composition of his Institutes of Theology.
          He died suddenly.

          Dr. Chalmers is to-day a molding influence. All the churches of
          Scotland unite to do him reverence. He was a greater worker than
          writer, and a greater man than either. It was surely enough
          honor for one life to inspire spiritual life throughout an
          entire land; and as the tireless and practical reformer, as the
          Christian philanthropist, and, above all, as the founder of the
          Free Church of Scotland, he will live.

   [6] "Now ought we to praise the founder of the heavenly kingdom, the
   power of the Creator, and his wisdom, the deeds of the Father of Glory;
   how he, since he is God eternal, is the author of all things wonderful,
   and the one who first created the heaven as a roof for the sons of men,
   then the earth--the almighty guardian of the human race." Bede explains
   that he gives the sense, not the order of words, and wisely remarks
   that no verses can be transferred verbatim from one language to
   another, no matter how well it may be done, without losing much of
   their beauty and power.

   [7] The term Cæsaropapism is somewhat opprobrious in its implications;
   but if it is to be kept in use at all it is applicable to all
   monarchical governments in which union of Church and State, with civil
   control, prevails. In a limited monarchy like Great Britain it is not
   as much the king as the cabinet, representing a majority of the
   representatives of the people, that exercises authority in religious
   matters. Where imperial authority is less limited, as in Germany,
   ecclesiastical control by the sovereign or his representative is more
   complete. Where imperial authority is absolute, as in Russia until
   recently, the term Cæsaropapism is applicable without qualification.A.
   H. N.

   [8] Cajetan bore witness to Luther's ability when he exclaimed, "Ego
   nolo amplius cum hac bestia colloqui: habet enim profundos oculos et
   mirabiles speculationes in capite suo." (I do not want to have any
   further parley with that beast; for he has sharp eyes and wonderful
   speculations in his head.)

   [9] "Nam si modo valeat mea auctoritas vivum exire nunquam patiar (I
   shall never permit him to depart alive if my authority is great
   enough)." Calvin to Farel, Feb. 13, 1546 (cf. Calvin's Letters, Eng.
   transl., ii. 33).

   [10] P. C. Lucius, Die Therapeuten und ihre Stellung in der Askese,
   Strasburg, 1880, has proved that the De vita contemplativa was not
   written by Philo and consequently the classic passage--"In every house
   there is a sacred shrine, which is called the holy place, and the
   monastery in which they [the Therapeutics] retire by themselves, and
   perform all the mysteries of a holy life . . . studying in that place
   the laws and the inspired words through the prophets and hymns and the
   other [writings), by which knowledge and piety are increased and
   perfected" (De vita contempl., iii.), which is the only direct
   reference to the threefold division of the canon found in Philo's works
   (genuine and pretended)--must be given up. [The passage is translated
   by C. D. Yonge, Philo, in Bohn's Library, iv. 6. F. C. Conybeare, in
   his edition of Philo About the Contemplative Life (Oxford, 1895)
   defends the Philonian authorship.]

   [11] This passage in condensed form is as follows: "We have twenty-two
   books containing the records of all the past times, and justly believed
   to be inspired. Five of them are Moses'. These contain his laws and the
   traditions of the origin of mankind till his death. From Moses to
   Artaxerxes the prophets made the record in thirteen books. The
   remaining four books contain hymns to God, and precepts for the conduct
   of human life. The history written since that day, though accurate, is
   not so much esteemed, because there has not been an exact succession of
   prophets. No one dares add to, take from, or alter them; but all Jews
   esteem these books to contain divine doctrines, and are willing to die
   for them."

   [12] This document is the source of the familiar division of Irish
   saints into three "orders." It states that the first order belonged to
   the time of Patrick. They were all bishops, 350 in number, founders of
   churches. They had one head, Christ, and one lord, Patrick; they
   observed one mass, one celebration, and one tonsure from ear to ear;
   they kept one Easter, on the fourteenth day of the moon after the
   vernal equinox; and what was excommunicated by one church all
   excommunicated. They did not reject the services and society of women,
   because, founded on the rock of Christ, they feared not the blast of
   temptation. This order lasted through four reigns, and its members were
   all bishops, from the Romans, the Franks, the Britons, and the Irish
   (Scotti). In the second order bishops were few and presbyters many, 300
   in number. They had one head, our Lord; they celebrated different
   masses and had different rules, but their Easter and tonsure were as in
   the first order. They rejected the services of women, separating them
   from the monasteries. They lasted through four reigns, and received a
   mass from Bishop David, and Gildas, and Docus, the Britons. The members
   of the third order were holy presbyters and a few bishops, 100 in all.
   They dwelt in solitary places, and lived on herbs and water and alms,
   shunning private property. Their rules, masses, tonsure, and Easter
   were all different, and they lived through four reigns. The first order
   was sanctissimus; the second, sanctus sanctorum; the third, sanctus.
   They were like the sun, the moon, the dawn. These three orders were
   foreseen by Patrick is a vision from on high. Consult Haddan and
   Stubbs, ii. 292-294.

   [13] Irish monasticism of the sixth century was very different from
   that of a later period. It has been characterized as the transition
   from the hermit life to the religious orders of the Middle Ages--a
   transition that was soon made in the East, but in Ireland proceeded
   more slowly and lasted till the subjection to Rome. The primitive Irish
   monasteries were of the same type as those of Egypt and Syria. The
   nucleus was a church or oratory, always oblong (from ten to forty feet
   in length, rarely sixty), and without chancel, aisles, or apse. No
   remains have been found showing any approach to the basilica form or
   anything of Roman type. Round the church were grouped "beehive" huts or
   cells, each for a single occupant, and the whole was surrounded by a
   wall or rampart, with a ditch, and a hedge or palisade on top. There is
   mention of kitchens and the "great house" (refectory); and there were
   also guest houses, storehouses and barns, workshops, and the like. The
   so-called "Round Towers" are always connected with ecclesiastical
   foundations, and belong for the most part to the ninth and tenth
   centuries. They probably served as bell-towers, for refuge or defense
   in case of attack, and as beacons and lighthouses. The whole
   establishment was called a "city" (civitas), and the designation is not
   inapt for the larger communities, with two or three thousand members,
   each having his own house, and its complex of public or common
   buildings. The first step in the foundation was to obtain a site, which
   was frequently given by the chieftain when he was converted, and
   sometimes was his fortress. It was often necessarily in the forest, as
   the extent of cleared land was very limited. The building material was
   most commonly wood or wattles and clay, but stone sometimes was used;
   the earliest stone structures are without mortar. As the first building
   operation was commonly the driving of stakes, "to drive" came to be the
   usual expression to designate the founding of a monastery. Each
   monastery had its own rules, followed also by the affiliated houses,
   which were governed by a local head under the abbot. The abbot was not
   chosen by the monks, but was appointed by the chieftain, generally from
   his own family or that of the founder, and hence was known as the coarb
   or heir of the founder. He was seldom a bishop, but there were always
   one or more bishops in each community, always subject, however, to the
   abbot. Poverty, chastity, and obedience were considered essential. The
   rule of [905]St. Columban no doubt represents the life and practise of
   the Irish monasteries, particularly that at Bangor, of which Columban
   had been a member. Adamnan also gives many interesting details of the
   life at Iona in Columba' s time and this monastery, doubtless, did not
   differ materially from the others. Divine service and private devotion,
   study, and manual labor occupied the time of the brethren. Sundays and
   saints' days were marked by celebration of the Eucharist, rest from
   toil, and an allowance of better food. Easter was the chief festival
   and during the Paschales Dies (from Easter to Whitsunday) there was
   some relaxation in the severity of discipline. Christmas was the other
   great festival. Wednesdays and Fridays were fast-days except during the
   Paschales Dies. Lent was strictly kept, and the forty days before
   Christmas were observed by some in a like manner. Holy Scripture was
   the chief object of study and the Psalms were learned by heart. Much
   effort was spent in the copying of books and there are two Irish
   manuscripts of the Vulgate, known respectively as the Book of Kells and
   the Book of Durrow and dating from the seventh century, which are among
   the finest extant specimens of illuminated work. It is a question where
   such work was done, as it must have been impossible in the poorly
   lighted cells; perhaps it was executed in the open air, and we read of
   the monks writing "on their knees." Besides writing, the production and
   preparation of food was the chief labor. Strangers were hospitably
   received and fasts were relaxed in their honor. Consult: Reeves's
