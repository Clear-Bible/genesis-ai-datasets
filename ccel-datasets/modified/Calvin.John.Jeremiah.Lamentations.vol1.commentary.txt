   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.

   The Commentaries On Jeremiah, like those on The Minor Prophets, were
   delivered as Lectures In The Theological School At Geneva, taken down
   by some of the Pupils, and afterwards read to Calvin, and corrected. We
   find in them the production of the same vigorous and expansive mind:
   The Divine Oracles are faithfully explained, the meaning is clearly
   stated, and such brief deductions are made as the subjects legitimately
   warrant. Though the Lectures were extemporaneously delivered, there is
   yet so much order preserved, and such brevity, clearness, and
   suitableness of diction are found in them, that in these respects they
   nearly equal the most finished compositions of Calvin as proof that he
   possessed a mind of no common order.

   The Ministry Of Jeremiah extended over a large space of time from the
   thirteenth year of Josiah's reign till after the final overthrow of the
   nation; but for how long after that period, it is not known. [1]
   Between the thirteenth year of Josiah and the destruction of the city
   and Temple, there were about forty years. This was a remarkable period,
   and Jeremiah nearly alone labored among the people. Their sins had been
   for the most part the same for a long time -- for nearly two centuries,
   as it appears from the testimonies of his predecessors, Amos, Hosea,
   Isaiah, Joel, Micah, Nahum, and Zephaniah; for these seven had in this
   order preceded him. Zephaniah And Habakkuk were probably for a time his
   contemporaries, the first at the commencement, and the other near the
   end of his ministry. The contumacy with which Jeremiah often charged
   the Jews was here evident, as they continued in their evil courses
   after so many urgent remonstrances by the former Prophets.

   What an example of blindness and of the power of superstition does the
   history of the Jews at this period exhibit! No past nor present
   calamities, and no threatenings of still greater calamities, and no
   promises of Divine favor and of temporal blessings, were sufficient to
   keep them from idolatrous and immoral practices -- and such practices,
   too, as were plainly and explicitly condemned by that very Law which
   they professed to receive! Such inconsistency might have been deemed
   impossible, had it not been exemplified in the Jews: but it is an
   inconsistency which is still exhibited in the conduct of many calling
   themselves Christians.

   As to The Style Of Jeremiah, the opinion of the accurate and elegant
   Lowth is as follows:

   "Jeremiah, though not wanting either in elegance or sublimity, is yet
   in both inferior to Isaiah. Jerome seems to charge him with some
   measure of rusticity as to his expressions; but of this, I truly
   confess, I have found no traces. In thoughts, indeed, he is somewhat
   less elevated, being for the most part more loose and diffuse in his
   sentences, as one more conversant with the more tender feelings, being
   especially capable of expressing sorrow and sympathy. This, indeed,
   appears mainly in The Lamentations, where these feelings alone
   predominate; but it is also often found in his Prophecies, and
   particularly in the first part of his Book, which is chiefly poetical.
   The middle part is nearly all historical; and the last, consisting of
   six chapters, is altogether poetical, and contains several oracles
   plainly expressed, in which the Prophet nearly approaches the sublimity
   of Isaiah. But of the whole Book of Jeremiah, hardly the half do I
   consider to be poetical." -- Proel, 21.

   Venema mainly agrees with Lowth: he blames Jerome for ascribing
   rusticity of diction to our Prophet, and says that he was no good judge
   (peritus Judex) of such matters. Speaking of Jeremiah's style, he says,
   "His diction is not so lofty and sublime as that of Isaiah, though in
   the six last chapters, 46-51., it seems to me to be nearly equal to it,
   being no less pure, expressive, and copious, besprinkled also with
   tropes and metaphors as with lights, and fitted to move the feelings
   and to stimulate the heart to repentance, for which it was designed.
   The Lamentations alone are sufficient to defend Jeremiah against the
   charge of ignorance and rusticity; for antiquity, as Sanctums rightly
   observes, has nothing more grave, more harmonious, more expressive."
   Com. ad Jer., p. 8.

   "He is admirably pathetic," says Scott; "his descriptions of
   approaching judgments are peculiarly vivid; and his eloquence is very
   vigorous and impressive, when inveighing against the shameless audacity
   of the people in rebellion against God."

   Of Jeremiah as a Prophet, Henry mentions these particulars: 1. That he
   was made a Prophet when young;-2. That he continued long a Prophet;-3.
   That he was a reproving Prophet;-4. That he was a weeping Prophet; --
   and, 5. That he was a suffering Prophet, having been persecuted by his
   own nation more than any other.

   There are several references in the New Testament to Jeremiah and to
   his writings. See Matthew 2:17, 18; Matthew 16:14; Hebrews 8:8-13;
   Hebrews 10:15-17. "These last references, "observes Scott, "are
   peculiarly important; for in one of them God himself is mentioned as
   speaking the words referred to; and in the other it is said, Whereof
   the Holy Ghost is a witness to us.' This is decisive, as to the
   judgment of the inspired Apostles, respecting the Book on which we now
   enter, and is peculiarly suited to put us on our guard against those
   professed friends of the Scriptures, who speak of these books as
   venerable, authentic, or genuine remains of antiquity, of great value
   and high authority, but hesitate to vindicate them as divinely
   inspired." Pref. to Jer.

   Nothing is with any certainty known as having been written by Jeremiah,
   except this Book and the Lamentations. Ascribed to him has been a
   funeral song on the death of Josiah, (2 Chronicles 35:25) which,
   Josephus says, was extant in his day. It has been also said by some
   that he wrote the 137th Psalm (Psalm 137), and in connection with
   Ezekiel, the 46th Psalm (Psalm 46). His Letter to the captives in
   Babylon in the Apocrypha, appended to the book of Barite, is no doubt
   spurious: its style is very different from that of Jeremiah.

   It is universally admitted that the Chapters in this Book are not in
   their right order. How this has happened, none have been able to
   conjecture; but the fact is evident. According to Blayney, whose
   account seems correct, the twelve first chapters contain prophecies
   delivered in the reign of Josiah. Those in the thirteenth, and in the
   following chapters to the twentieth inclusively, were delivered in the
   reign of Jehoiakim. Now begins the disorder; the twenty -- first
   contains what was spoken in the time of Zedekiah, the last king: and
   afterwards we have what was delivered in a former reign. The kings of
   Judah, during Jeremiah's ministry, were these: Josiah; Shallum or
   Jehoahaz, his second son; Jehoiakim, his eldest son; Jeconiah, the son
   of Jehoiakim; and Zedekiah, the youngest son of Josiah. Blayney thinks
   that no prophecies were delivered in the reigns of Shallum and of
   Jeconiah. Then his classification may be stated as follows:-During the
   reign of

   Josiah, were delivered, chapters 1-12, inclusively.

   Shallum, none.

   Jehoiakim, chapters 13-20, inclusively, 22, 23, 25, 26, 35, 36, 45, 46,
   47, 48, and 49 to verse 33 inclusively.

   Jeconiah, none.

   Zedekiah, chapters 21, 24, 27 -34, 37-39, 49: from verse 34 to the end,
   1, and 51.

   The 40-44, inclusively, were written after the destruction of Jerusalem
   and the captivity of the people; and the 52, the last, during the same
   time, or as it is commonly supposed, by Ezra; it is an epitome of the
   progressive and final overthrow of the kingdom.

   There were several circumstances worthy of notice, with regard to The
   Jews, during the ministry of Jeremiah:

   1. The means which God employed to lead them to repentance, and to a
   reformation of their conduct, both as to religion and morals: he gave
   them a pious and a reforming king in Josiah; the Book of the Law was
   providentially discovered and widely made known; a reformation was
   carried on according to its requirements, while idolatrous practices
   were in a great measure put an end to; the people had also before their
   eyes the awful judgment of God on their brethren, The Israelites, in
   banishing them from their country; and the powerful preaching of
   Jeremiah sounded in their ears.

   2. The manifest evidences of God's displeasure: their good king,
   Josiah, was suddenly taken from them, no doubt as a judgment for their
   ingratitude; his successor, Suallum, was, after three months' reign,
   taken prisoner by the Egyptians, and the country was put under tribute;
   the country was visited with grievous famine, as recorded in chap. 14.;
   and Jeremiah, by God's command, denounced on them the punishment of an
   entire extinction as a nation.

   3. The extremely corrupted state of the people: they were both most
   idolatrous and most immoral, unfaithful to God and to man in a degree
   hardly credible. During Josiah's reign they pretended to cast away
   their gross superstitions, but after his death they returned to them,
   as it were, with increased avidity; and with these superstitions was
   combined the prostration of every moral principle, and of every natural
   feeling. Superstition ever destroys morality, and enfeebles all the
   social and natural sympathies of men. What a picture of the effects of
   superstition is given by Jeremiah in chapter 9!

   4. Notwithstanding this extremely degenerated state of things, The Jews
   harbored the conviction that their ruin, as denounced by Jeremiah, was
   impossible. While practically denying God, they yet rested their
   confidence on his promises respecting the perpetuity of David's
   kingdom, and on their outward privileges; taking as unconditional what
   was conditional, and regarding the mere possession of divine
   institutions as a sufficient security. And in this vain confidence they
   were encouraged and confirmed by false Prophets and corrupt Priests, in
   opposition to God's messages by his Prophet Jeremiah, and to the plain
   declarations of that Law, the authority of which they still ostensibly
   acknowledged!

   These things have been recorded for our instruction.

   Some of Jeremiah's Prophecies were fulfilled in the days of many of
   those who heard them; such as those which refer to the Captivity of the
   people, and to the destruction of the neighboring nations by the king
   of Babylon. Other prophecies extend farther, to times more remote, to
   the destruction of Babylon, to the restoration of the Jews after the
   term of seventy years, and to the destinies of various nations. There
   are also Prophecies respecting The Messiah, as The Lord Our
   Righteousness, The Evangelical Covenant, The Call of the Gentiles, and
   final Restoration of The Jews. So that there are in this Book some
   Prophecies which were soon fulfilled, others at a more distant time,
   and some which are still to be fulfilled. Who but GOD, the Sole and the
   Supreme Ruler of the world, and the regulator and disposer of all
   events, could have announced such Prophecies? All those which refer to
   the past have been fulfilled, fully and completely; and with no less
   certainty shall all such as refer to what is future be in due time
   fulfilled. Nothing can intercept the exercise of Divine Faithfulness;
   nothing can obstruct the working of Infinite Power.

   [1] According to an ancient tradition, mentioned by Jerome and others,
   Jeremiah was stoned to death by the Jews at Tahpanhes in Egypt, (see
   Jeremiah 43:8) shortly after their removal there, subsequent to the
   destruction of Jerusalem. So that he did not live long after that
   event: it may be two or three years.

   TO THE NOBLE

   AND VERTVOVS LADY,

   THE LADY LVCIE, COVNTESSE

   of Bedford: And to the Right Honorable and highly honored Lady, the
   Lady Anne Harrington, Barrones: mercy
   and peace be multiplied

   Right Honorable: The holy Prophet Jeremiah (according to the diuers
   subjects he had to work upon in his ministerial function) is forced
   sometimes, with Isaiah his forerunner, to lift up his voice like unto a
   Sonne of Thunder; (Isaiah 58:1) and eftsoones, with the same Prophet
   againe, to altar and change the same into the still and soft voice of a
   Sonne of Consolation: (1 Kings 19:20) wherein, as God's faithful
   messenger, hee carries himself faithfully: For as a Sonne of Thunder,
   he sharply inueyes against the sinnes and sinners of his time, boldly
   denouncing God's judgements against them; and as a Sonne of
   Consolation, (for their sakes whom the Lord had appointed to bee heires
   of sahation,) hee sweetly preacheth Christ, mixing often with the
   terrible threats of the Law the sauing promises of the Gospel; that if
   any came, by the ministry of the one, to be pricked in conscience and
   humbled, (Acts 2:37) he readily, like the good Samaritan, powreth in
   the mollifying and healing oyle of the other to cure and reuiue them.
   And thus, as a wise disposer and dispenser of the manifold secrets of
   God, (Psalm 101:1) his song (in a manner) throughout his Prophesy (like
   Aaron's Bels -- Exodus 28:33) soundeth forth judgement and mercy;
   preaching judgement to such as were and would be sinners in Sion,
   (Isaiah 33:14) and mercy to such as he saw to be mourners in Sion.
   (Isaiah 61:3). In which respects he may serue as a liuely patterne for
   all Preachers to follow in their ordinary course of preaching. These
   Sermons of his (many of them) doe notably sute to our times; and
   therefore ought to be read, and read againe, of all estates high and
   low.

   But for as much as in reading the Prophets sundry difficulties are met
   withall, which euery one hath not the skill of himself to dissolue, it
   would (as I think) be very beneficial for such if they had an holy
   helper, such an one as this, ready at hand: An interpreter; One
   (indeed) of a thousand, (Job 33:23) that might help to dissolve their
   doubts, and unloose their hard knots for them; that so understanding
   what they read, they might (by the blessing of God) with the more ease
   come to profit by their reading. This hath our Philip (Acts 8:34-35)
   faithfully performed (according to that light of understanding
   wherewith the Lord had extraordinarily endowed him) throughout the
   Prophets; and pity it is that so great light should after a sort he
   buried in darkness from many well minded Christians, onely because they
   are not (as they might be) turned into our owne natiue language.

   Not many yeeres since, a Lampe (if I may so speake) began to be
   kindled, for giuing them some insight into the harder passages of the
   Prophets, by translating this Author's Commentaries vpon the Prophecie
   of Isaiah into English; but much more cleere would the light haue now
   shined if thereunto had been added the translation of all his Lectures
   vpon the Prophesie of Ieremiah also. For mine owne part, seeing
   sufficiency of oyle hath failed me to furnish out this second Lampe
   vnto the end, I haue for the present proceeded onely through the flue
   first Chapters.

   The which (Right Honorable) as a testimony of that seruice and duty I
   owe your Honors, I have presumed (as one ouertaken with Ahimaaz his
   hast, sorewhat abruptly, I confesse) to dedicate vnto you: And if in
   token of your favorable acceptance thereof you shall be pleased to
   suffer the same to passe vnder your Honorable names and patronage, many
   may be occasioned thereby to blesse God for you, and my selfe still to
   pray, that the blessing of him who was ready to perish may come vpon
   you.

   Your Honor's humbly
   at commandment,

   CLEMENT COTTON.

   TO THE

   MOST ILLUSTRIOUS PRINCE,

   D. FREDERICK,

   LORD PALATINE OF THE RHINE, AND ELECTOR OF THE ROMAN EMPIRE, ETC.,

   AND HIS MOST BENEVOLENT LORD,

   JOHN CALVIN

   WISHES ALL HAPPINESS.

   As your heroic valor, Most Illustrious Prince, has been acknowledged by
   superior men and competent judges, and especially your singular piety,
   your labor to cherish and to promote true Religion, and uniform
   moderation through life; and also your great courtesy, such as can
   hardly be found in a private individual, and which I have not only
   known by report, but have also myself experienced, I have long wished
   by some public act to testify to posterity the high regard I entertain
   for you, being not satisfied with having it only in secret. This is
   well known to the noble -- minded Edward, the Count or Espach, whom I
   have consulted on the subject.

   But to discharge this duty at this time, not only an opportunity seems
   to be offered to me, but a certain necessity appears to constrain me;
   for, as you have reverently embraced the sound and orthodox doctrine
   concerning the Holy Supper of Christ, and have not hesitated freely and
   wisely to avow the same in your dominion, so turbulent and unreasonable
   men rage against you, as though you had upset all Germany! Hence they
   rush headlong to assail your Highness with violent clamors; and as they
   cannot prevail by authority and power, being full of presumption and
   insolence, they hesitate not to vomit forth their curses, of which men
   in their right mind would be ashamed; and not only so, but as it is not
   in their power to kill you, they fabricate shameful rumors respecting
   your death, as though a plot of flies were sufficient to darken the
   sun. And you, indeed, Most Illustrious Prince, according to the
   magnanimity of your mind, and in accordance with the high dignity in
   which God has placed you, do altogether disregard their mad conduct;
   but as they so busily labor to provoke you, and at the same time bring
   in my name to create an ill -- will to you, I have thought it my duty,
   in refuting these calumnies, to set up as a shield against them the
   very name which they wish to make so odious; for certainly they are
   wholly unworthy that your Highness should raise your little finger
   against them, or utter the smallest word. Were I indeed disposed to
   expostulate with them on account of their madness in hating so much a
   man who has done something for the Church of God, and of whose labors
   they avail themselves with the unlearned, though they acknowledge it
   not, they would have no plea for their ingratitude. While, then, they
   endeavor, by bringing forward Calvinism, to affix to your Highness some
   mark of infamy, they do nothing more than betray their own perversity,
   and also their folly and disgrace. But if they think that they gain
   something among those who are like themselves, my voice, on the other
   hand, in speaking of your just praises, will, I hope, be attended to by
   the godly, the well -- informed, and men of calm minds and sound
   judgment.

   Unprincipled men of this character do indeed pretend and loudly exclaim
   that they fight for God and their country; but whether it be so, it is
   easy for any one to judge: and I will not indeed discuss at large their
   delirious notions, as the greater part of them understand not what they
   vainly talk; I will only touch briefly on the main points in which we
   differ from their masters, for whom, nevertheless, I have a sincere
   regard.

   That we really feed in the Holy Supper on the flesh and blood of
   Christ, no otherwise than as bread and wine are the aliments of our
   bodies, we freely confess. If a clearer explanation is asked, we say,
   that the substance of Christ's flesh and blood is our spiritual life,
   and that it is communicated to us under the symbols of bread and wine;
   for Christ, in instituting the mystery of The Supper, promised nothing
   falsely, nor mocked us with a vain shew, but represented by external
   signs what he has really given us.

   Now the question rests on the mode of communication; and hence the
   conflict arises, because we refuse to subscribe to their fancy
   respecting a local presence. We say, that though Christ is in heaven,
   yet through the hidden and incomprehensible power of his Spirit, this
   favor comes to us that His flesh becomes life to us, so that we become
   flesh of his flesh and bones of his bones. (Ephesians 5:30.) By them,
   on the contrary, it is maintained, that except Christ comes down on
   earth, there is no participation. That they may, however, get rid of
   the absurdity of a local presence, it has been found necessary to
   fabricate the strange notion of ubiquity; which, if we think it not
   possible to reconcile to the principles of faith, we must beg them at
   least to pardon our ignorance. Here we follow not our own
   understanding; but according to the knowledge given us from above, we
   cannot comprehend that it is at all agreeable to Scripture to say that
   the body of Christ is everywhere. Both Christ himself and His Apostles
   clearly shew that the immensity of God does not belong to the flesh; a
   personal union is what they teach; and no one, except Eutyches, has
   hitherto taught, that the two natures became so blended, that when
   Christ became man, the attributes of Deity were communicated to his
   human nature. I am not indeed disposed to raise an odium against them
   by means of a man who has been condemned; they are yet to be reminded
   to think more attentively, and to consider how contention leads astray
   even good, learned, and acute men, when they are led away only by a
   desire to defend their own cause. Doubtless the best and the shortest
   way of confronting Nestorius at the Council of Ephesus would have been
   to say, that personal union communicates to two natures what is
   peculiar to each: to adduce this no one thought of doing on account of
   its absolute absurdity. I therefore greatly wonder that they who oppose
   us do not consider into what labyrinth they plunge themselves.

   For if the infinity of God appertains to the flesh of Christ, because
   God was manifested in the flesh, with equal reason His Divinity may be
   said to have grieved and to have been thirsty, and to have been subject
   to death, and, in short, to have died; for they cannot escape, as it is
   a similar mode of reasoning. Christ, while yet a mortal, declared that
   He knew not when the day of judgment would be. Does He not in these
   words clearly and distinctly ascribe something to His human nature
   which could not justly be ascribed to His Divinity? What they bring
   forward as to the communication of properties, it is unreasonable, and
   what I may say without offending them, they mistake in a matter that is
   very simple and plain; for to ascribe what is peculiar to Deity to the
   Son of man, and again to attribute to Deity what belongs only to
   humanity, is very improper and rash. To prevent the ignorant from
   stumbling by blending together different things, and to take away from
   the dishonest any occasion for contending, orthodox writers have called
   this figure, "The communication of properties." [2]

   What they have said of certain expressions, has been with little
   thought applied to the subject. While Christ was on earth he said that
   the Son of man was in heaven. That no one, ill -- informed, might think
   Christ's body to be infinite, it has been deemed necessary to meet this
   case by a plain admonition, that on account of the unity of person what
   is suitable only to Divinity has been said of the Son of man. Paul
   says, as it is recorded by Luke, that God redeemed the Church by His
   own blood. (Acts 20:28.) Lest no one may hence conceive that God has
   blood, the same admonition ought to be sufficient to untie the knot;
   for as Christ was man and God, what is peculiar to His human nature is
   ascribed to His Divinity. As it was the Father's design to employ this
   figure of speech for the purpose of teaching the simple and ignorant,
   it is absurd and even shameful to apply it for a different purpose, and
   to say that the communication of properties is the real blending of two
   natures.

   But Christ, it is said, sits at the Father's right hand, which is to be
   taken as meaning everywhere, confined within no limits. I indeed allow
   that God's right hand is unlimited, and that wherever it is there is
   the kingdom of Christ; which is metaphorically represented in Scripture
   by the tern sitting: for whatever is declared of God is beyond
   controversy to be now ascribed to Christ; and therefore to sit, which
   means to govern the world, is what Christ has in common with the
   Father; and still more, as the Father by Him sustains the world, rules
   all things by His power, and especially manifests the presence of His
   grace in governing His Church, He may be said, strictly speaking, to
   reign in His own person. It hence follows, that he in a manner is
   everywhere; for He can be limited to no place who sustains and protects
   all parts of heaven and earth, and rules and regulates by His power all
   things above and below. When now I name Christ, I include the whole
   Person of the only -- begotten Son, as manifested in the flesh. He, I
   say, God and man, is everywhere as to his authority and
   incomprehensible power, and infinite glory, according to what the
   faithful experience by evident effects, as they know and feel His
   presence. It is not then without reason that Paul declares, that He
   dwells in us. (Ephesians 3:17.) But to distort what is said of His
   infinite power, which is evident in His spiritual gifts, in the
   invisible aid which He affords, and in the whole of our salvation, and
   to apply it to His flesh, is by no means reasonable or consistent.

   I wish that many of those who are with little reason angry with us,
   were at least to recall to mind that common and notable saying used in
   the Papal Schools, "Christ is whole everywhere, but not altogether."
   [3] They may repeat' it as it is in the barbarous language of Peter
   Lombard, which is not pleasant to their tender and delicate ears. It is
   yet wisely expressed, from whomsoever it may have come, and I willingly
   adopt it. But I wonder whence is this daintiness! Seeing the
   Recantation of Berengarius delights Westphalus and those who are like
   him that Christ's body is broken by the teeth and digested by the
   stomach -- why is this sober distinction to be loathed, that Christ our
   Mediator is every -- where entire, but not as to His flesh, which is
   confined within certain limits, while this power is infinite, and its
   operation felt on earth as well as in heaven?

   There are two words commonly used, Union (unio) and Unity (unitas;) the
   first is applied to the two Natures, and the second to the Person
   alone. To assert the unity of the flesh and of Divinity, those would be
   ashamed to do, if I am not deceived, who yet inconsiderately adopt this
   absurdity; for, except the flesh differs and is distinct in its own
   peculiar properties from the Divine nature, they are by blending
   together become one. They, cavilling, facetiously ask, "In what region
   of the empyreal heaven does Christ sit?" let them indeed enjoy these
   fine speculations. I am taught by the Holy Spirit, that He is above all
   heavens, (Ephesians 4:10) according to the common mode of speaking in
   Scripture, I call whatever is beyond the world heaven. Hence it is
   enough for me, when Christ is to be sought, that our minds are to be
   raised above, that they may not remain on the earth and be entangled in
   gross superstitions.

   This, then, is the sum and substance of the whole controversy, which
   the chief leaders of the adverse party too pertinaciously agitate,
   unless, indeed, we add another subject that the wicked, as they
   contend, partake of the flesh and blood of Christ no less than the true
   servants of God. And we indeed allow that they are equally offered to
   both; and that whatever may be the difference between men, yet God ever
   continues like himself the same; and that hence the difference in those
   who presumptuously thrust themselves does not arise from the nature of
   the sacrament. When, therefore, Christ gives his body to the unworthy,
   the difference proceeds from the manner in which it is received. But we
   deny that those are capable of receiving Christ whom the devil holds as
   his slaves, and in whom he has his habitation. We do not, however,
   reject the usual mode of speaking, that Christ is received by them
   sacramentally, provided absurd interpreters pervert not the words of
   Augustine, in which sacramental eating is said to be the reception of
   the substance without the grace; but this is a foolish remark, and
   unknown to Augustine. The reason they adduce, as it is weak, may easily
   be refuted. They say, that Christ came not only for salvation to the
   elect, but also for condemnation to the reprobate, because the Gospel
   being not received, but rejected, is the savor of death unto death to
   those who perish. But who has ever heard that the participation of
   Christ produces death? But if Christ be the occasion of condemnation to
   unbelievers because He is rejected by them, I see not how it can be
   that they procure for themselves condemnation by receiving his flesh.
   They answer and say, that they are, nevertheless, closed up so as not
   to admit His grace. But that they may gain credit to what they say,
   they must first prove their strange notion that those who are alienated
   from Christ eat His flesh, while it is to those without life destitute
   of its own virtue, and empty.

   I have now faithfully and plainly explained why they who boast
   themselves to be the followers of Luther so hastily contend with us at
   this day. For the same reason they pour forth their execrations on
   Phillip Melancthon, now dead, a man who, for his incomparable knowledge
   in the highest branches of literature, his deep piety, and other
   endowments, deserves to be remembered by all ages, and whom they have
   hitherto regarded as their leader: and it is strange, that in order to
   obtain the favor of the public, they pretend to adopt that noble
   Confession Of Augsburg, of which he was especially the author, and
   ought to be deemed its true interpreter. I regard them as turbulent and
   unprincipled men, who possess no common courtesy, and feel no shame.

   But there are those who, in this respect, are different, and observe
   some moderation: and yet I have a just reason to complain, for some of
   them have acted so unfairly as to give my name in what they have
   published in German, and to withhold it in the Latin editions. Now this
   is to curse the deaf!

   But, to omit other things, I revert again to their violent clamors,
   which are similar to the clamors of those frantic zealots, mentioned by
   Josephus, through whose excesses a cruel war was kindled, which
   involved Judea in entire ruin. (De Bell. Jude., lib. 14 et 15.) They
   can find nothing more atrocious by which they can irritate your
   Highness, Most Illustrious Prince, than the word Calvinism. But whence
   this bitter hatred towards me it is not difficult to conjecture. For as
   they have thought the shortest way to victory to be by suppressing and
   concealing the real state of the case, and by dazzling the eyes of the
   simple, it is no wonder that they burn with rage when the clouds of
   ignorance in which they securely exulted were dissipated; and what
   especially drives them even to madness, is the fact, that they find
   that the whole subject is fully and really known by you, so that the
   doctrine, for which they triumphed while it was unknown, having
   obtained the patronage of high authority, and being supported by the
   pious and strong defense of a wise Prince, makes a freer progress.

   It would indeed be superfluous to exhort you, who are of yourself
   sufficiently disposed, to persevere. That you may, however, disregard
   their impotency, and pursue the object so happily as well as
   judiciously undertaken, it seems not an useless attempt to confirm you
   in your course by leaving a pledge of the high regard I entertain for
   you. And I thought it no act of ingratitude for your incredible
   courtesy to dedicate to your renowned name my Commentaries On Jeremiah.
   I indeed confess that it has not been elucidated with that care which
   so excellent a Book deserves; for as I delivered the Lectures from the
   pulpit, they were taken from my mouth; and I have indeed been before
   ashamed, that what might have been more accurately revised and polished
   by a longer meditation has come forth to light. I am also afraid lest
   the malevolent should accuse me of arrogance, for having obtruded on
   the public discourses extemporaneous and unwritten, and designed for a
   small auditory. It is easy to reply to the latter charge, for the first
   volume was sent to press against my will. That I may not, however, be
   without excuse, what I have to say is, that I have been led by the
   judgment of others. I hear of impartial and plain readers, who declare
   that they have received no small benefit from this kind of labor. And
   further, some think that a good end may be attained by making known my
   extempore mode of teaching, as its simplicity may cure many, who are
   too anxious of display, of that vice. Though learning and aptness to
   teach cannot satisfy all, I have yet carefully endeavored that Religion
   and Faith should not be found wanting by the impartial and well
   disposed. Nor do I, indeed, fear the charge of arrogance, when I fully
   avow, that I would have by no means suffered this Book to go forth to
   the public had I not thought that it would be useful and profitable to
   the Church of God.

   But it may be that some rigid and severe critics will deem it a present
   unworthy of your Highness; but relying on your rare courtesy, Most
   Illustrious Prince, I hope it will be favorably accepted. And if
   Jeremiah himself were now alive on earth, he would add, if I am not
   deceived, his recommendation; for he would acknowledge that his
   Prophecies have been explained by me not less honestly than reverently;
   and further, that they have been usefully accommodated to present
   circumstances. I feel not, however, over anxious to find an excuse,
   provided I know that I have done no wrong, except through an excessive
   desire to testify the veneration with which I regard your Highness.

   But, to omit now what I have slightly mentioned at the beginning, I
   should condemn myself for ingratitude, were I not to consider myself
   under obligations to you for being so ready and disposed to receive The
   Christian Exiles who flee to you. It is the saying of a heathen woman,
   as mentioned by a poet-

   "Being acquainted with evil, I learn to aid the miserable." [4]

   Let all who worship God and serve Christ be not ashamed, under similar
   circumstances, to be at least of the same mind. As my power of aiding
   is not equal to my wish, it becomes me at least to regard every
   kindness shewn to them as done to myself. Thirty years have passed away
   since my voluntary exile from France, because thence were exiled the
   truth of the Gospel, pure Religion, and the true Worship of God. I am
   now become so inured to my peregrination, that I feel no desire to
   return to my country. I am indeed here so far a stranger, (though once
   banished, I was yet so recalled, that I never feel ashamed,) that they
   deem me no more a foreigner than if I could name my ancestors as the
   citizens of this place. But the more kindly God has dealt with me, the
   greater concern ought I to feel for my brethren from France as well as
   from Flanders: and as they have been received with the same kindness by
   your Highness, this stimulates and constrains me to avow my gratitude
   to one so much entitled to it.

   Nor let it cause you any regret, Most Illustrious Prince, that you have
   been sometimes deceived in foreigners, and indeed in men of our
   language, but go on in your wonted course of benevolence. All know how
   basely you have been deceived by that most audacious and unprincipled
   man, at the same time vile, proud, and perfidious-in short, a monster,
   made up of a mass of filthy materials, even Francis Baldwin, and yet a
   skillful collector of the Civil Law. For having been in The University
   Of Heidelberg, and having, under the pretext of the Gospel, been
   received under your patronage, and being made a Professor of the Civil
   Law through your liberality in The University Of Heidelberg, he ought
   to have considered himself as altogether bound by kindness to so
   munificent a Prince; but he regarded his elevation as advantageous to
   him to seek, after his own manner, a new situation. Hence, as soon as
   hope appeared, he deserted his station, having despised the honorable
   office which he had fraudulently attained, and passed over to the
   enemies of true and pure Religion, the name of which he had assumed.
   And first indeed (as though he retained some portion of shame) he went
   on stealthily in a clandestine manner, he discussed some secret
   treacheries with The Cardinal of Lorraine, into whose favor he had
   insinuated himself. The object of the whole was to subvert the Churches
   Of France by means of a spurious doctrine and a mixture of ceremonies.
   But as there appeared no reward for masked and hidden perfidy, he not
   only rushed headlong into open defection, but so insolently boasted of
   his wickedness, that he has surpassed similar apostates in canine
   wantonness. It is however well, that the perfidy of one unprincipled
   man does not stop the course of your kindness towards others; and you
   have some recompense for your perseverance, for among the ornaments of
   your University are to be found some foreigners well known for their
   high character, whom it is unnecessary for me to name.

   Though I can add nothing to the character of your Highness, either by
   my praise or by the dedication of this Work, yet I could not restrain
   myself from doing what I thought to be my duty. Farewell, Most
   Illustrious Prince. May God enrich you more and more with His spiritual
   gifts, keep you long in safety, and render your dignified station
   prosperous to you and yours.

   THE PRINTER TO THE CHRISTIAN READER,

   HEALTH.

   Though Readers were sufficiently reminded, when the Lectures of the
   beloved and learned John Calvin, on The Minor Prophets and on Daniel,
   were published, by what means and by whom they had been attained, so
   that it is to no purpose to sing the same song, for so would I seem to
   do, were I again to explain at large what has been before set forth; it
   is yet necessary, if I am not mistaken, to add now, that these Lectures
   On Jeremiah and the Lamentations were taken down by our two brethren,
   John Budeus and Charles Jonville, with the same care, fidelity, and
   diligence as the former Lectures, which cannot but appear to every one
   who will attentively read them.

   The Hebrew Text has not been inserted; and among other things, for this
   reason, because it is already possessed by those who understand the
   language, and to others it would be of no advantage. We were also
   afraid, that by increasing the Volume and the expense, we should
   unnecessarily charge the buyer.

   But that I may not be prolix and tedious, I pass by the great and
   manifold benefit that may be derived from this Volume, which will
   appear to each one better when it is read: for it is so replete with
   the precious wealth of heavenly Truth, that from it, as from a
   storehouse, may be drawn the sum and substance of Religion; and so it
   will no doubt be of great service to the whole Church of God.

   It remains for you, Christian Reader, to ascribe to God alone whatever
   benefit you may derive from these Commentaries; and to pray for Calvin,
   who well deserves this from all the godly, until he shall at length
   enjoy his eternal inheritance. Make use also thankfully of this so
   valuable a treasure, and judge kindly and impartially of what is
   cordially presented to you.

   THE PRAYER
   WHICH JOHN CALVIN WAS WONT TO USE AT THE BEGINNING OF HIS LECTURES:

   MAY the Lord grant, that we may engage in contemplating
   the mysteries of his heavenly wisdom with really increasing devotion,
   to his glory and to our edification. AMEN.

   CALVIN'S PREFACE

   TO THE BOOK OF

   THE PROPHET JEREMIAH.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lecture First.

   After having explained The Twelve Minor Prophets, we reached at length
   to the end of Daniel. I now undertake to explain The Book Of Jeremiah,
   provided life be spared and leisure be given me. But if through God's
   grace time will be allowed, there will remain still one Prophet, that
   is, Ezekiel; which I hope will be undertaken by a more competent
   Interpreter.

   As to Jeremiah, it must be first observed, that he commenced his office
   as a Prophet under Josiah, and in the thirteenth year of his reign, who
   was a sincere servant of God, and yet the state of things was then very
   confused: the Book of the Law was unknown; so that every one indulged
   his fancy in inventing many impious forms of worship. No doubt at a
   time when such liberty prevailed, there were many turbulent men
   laboring to pervert the worship of God and pure doctrine, and
   fabricating for themselves many absurd things. For if the priests
   taught rightly, they must have derived all their knowledge from the
   Law: and though it is probable, that the memory of it was not wholly
   lost, yet a few fragments only remained, so that they could not with
   certainty learn how the Church was to be regulated according to what
   had been received from above. For it is related in sacred history, that
   the Book was found in the eighteenth year of Josiah, (2 Chronicles
   34:8, 15;) so that Jeremiah had been then teaching for four, and even
   for five years.

   Now this fact clearly proves how great is the carelessness and sloth of
   men in the great concerns of Religion. God had commanded Moses, that a
   copy of the Law should not only be kept reverently and carefully in the
   Temple, but also by the kings themselves, (Deuteronomy 17:18;) and
   there was also added a command, that the whole Law should be read to
   the people at their festivals. (Deuteronomy 31:11.) But when the kings
   departed from the true worship of God, no copy of the Law was preserved
   by them: and at length the whole Law became as it were extinct. No
   doubt this happened through the tyranny of King Manasse, who cruelly
   raged against the priests and against all the other servants of God.
   Wherever only a spark of religion appeared, he was intent on slaughter;
   so that blood, as sacred history testifies, flowed through all the
   streets of Jerusalem. (2 Kings 21:16.) It was then no wonder, if he
   took away from the Temple all the copies of the Law found there, in
   order to extinguish all memory of true doctrine. However, a book, which
   had been hid, was found, as we are told, by the priest Hilkiah.

   The first thing then to be observed is the time when he began to teach:
   as religion was then so corrupted, and every one invented errors to
   suit his own humor, the office of Jeremiah must have been hard and
   arduous.

   Secondly, the termination of his ministry must be noticed. He says,
   that from that time he pursued his office until the transmigration. He
   therefore continued in his course for forty years. We shall hereafter
   see what hard contests he had to undergo during his life. But had the
   people been teachable, he could not have performed what God had
   commanded him without great pain and even weariness: for we shall
   presently see what was the doctrine which he was commanded to proclaim.
   As then he was assiduous in his labor for forty years, we hence
   perceive with what a courageous spirit he was endued. If we further
   consider what storms had been raised, calculated to cast him down from
   his high station, and even wholly to drive him from the right way, more
   clearly still will shine forth the invincible firmness of his mind and
   his zeal; for he never desisted from executing the office committed to
   him.

   We must further observe, that after the city was cut off, and the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem were led captives into Babylon, Jeremiah still
   continued to discharge his office. He was indeed drawn into Egypt, as
   we learn from the end of his Book, especially from chapter 44 (Jeremiah
   44); nay, he was taken there by force, while yet he pronounced a curse
   on all the Jews who sought hiding -- places in Egypt. Though he was
   forced to go there, yet it much lessened his authority; for we know
   that ungodly men lay hold on any pretense for evil -- speaking. There
   was here a specious pretense; "He cursed, "they said, "all who went to
   Egypt, and now where does he dwell himself? In Egypt with the other
   refugees." No doubt the faith of the holy man was shaken by these
   banterings: ungodliness has been wanton in all ages. There, then, after
   the destruction of the city, Jeremiah was constrained to bend his
   course: and it may be, that he persevered in his work and labor beyond
   fifty years. It is said, that he was stoned to death, and not unlikely,
   for he inveighed with no less severity against the Jews who had fled
   into Egypt, than against the city while it was standing; and despair
   might have roused them into madness. It is hence probable that they
   slew the holy Prophet, and thought this lawful because he upbraided
   them with their miseries, while his object was to correct their
   perverseness, which was untamable; and this they did not consider.

   I come now to The Contents of the Book. As Isaiah and the other
   Prophets spent their labor almost in vain, nothing remained for
   Jeremiah but briefly to announce this sentence, -- "There is now no
   pardon, but it is the time of extreme vengeance, for they have too long
   abused God's forbearance, who has borne with them, kindly and even
   sweetly exhorted them to repent, and testified that he would be
   exorable and propitious, provided they returned to the right way."
   Since then God's kindness had been despised by them, it became
   necessary for Jeremiah to fulminate against them as men lost and in a
   hopeless state of perverseness. The main thing then in his teaching was
   this:

   "It is all over with the kingdom and the priesthood; for the Jews have
   so often and in such various ways, and for so long a time, provoked
   God's wrath and rejected the pious warnings of his servants."

   Isaiah also in his time used threatenings; but we see that to mitigate
   what was terrible, some hope of pardon was added whenever he spoke with
   severity. But after the ten tribes had been carried into exile, and the
   kingdom had been visited with various calamities, while the Jews still
   continued impenitent, and even hardened themselves more and more under
   God's scourges, it was necessary, as I have said, that he should deal
   more sharply with them. God had contended with them by Isaiah and the
   other prophets; by Jeremiah and also by Ezekiel, he proved them guilty,
   and denounced on them the sentence of condemnation. This difference
   between the teaching of Isaiah and that of our Prophet, ought to be
   noticed. [5] At the same time, that Jeremiah's teaching might not be
   imperfect, it was God's purpose that he should be also the herald of
   his grace and of the salvation promised in Christ. This exception,
   however, ought to be borne in mind, that he offered them no hope of
   mercy until they had suffered the punishment due to their sins.

   We now then understand what Jeremiah mainly taught: but particulars
   will be better and more distinctly understood by readers by following
   the course of the text. And I do not now treat in general of what is to
   be found in the prophets; for this is what I have done elsewhere. I now
   then say only, that Jeremiah was sent by God to proclaim to the people
   their last calamity; and also to speak to them of their future
   redemption, and at the same time, ever to remind them of the
   interposition of seventy years in exile. I come now to the words.

   CHAPTER 1
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 1:1-3

   1. The words of Jeremiah the son of Hilkiah, of the priests that were
   in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin:

   1. Verba Jeremiae filii Helkiae, ex sacerdotibus qui erant in Anathoth,
   in terra Benjamin,

   2. To whom the word of the LORD came in the days of Josiah the son of
   Amon king of Judah, in the thirteenth year of his reign.

   2. Nempe ('sr explicative hic ponitur) fecit sermo Jehovae ad ipsum, in
   diebus Josiea, filii Amon, regis Jehudah, decimo tertio anno regm ejus;

   3. It came also in the days of Jehoiakim the son of Josiah king of
   Judah, unto the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah the son of Josiah
   king of Judah, unto the carrying away of Jerusalem captive in the fifth
   month.

   3. Et fuit (hoc est, perrexit in, cursum vocationis suae) diebus
   Joakim, filii Josiae, regis Jehudah, usque ad complementum undecimi
   anni Zedechiae, filii Josiae, regis Jehudah, ad transmigrationem
   Jerusalem, mense quinto.


   I Have said that the time, when Jeremiah began to discharge his office
   of a Prophet in God's Church, is not stated here without reason, and
   that it was when the state of the people was extremely corrupt, the
   whole of Religion having become vitiated, because the Book of the Law
   was lost: for nowhere else can be found the rule according to which God
   is to be worshipped; nor can right knowledge be obtained from any other
   source. It was then, at the time when impiety had by a long custom
   prevailed among the Jews, that Jeremiah suddenly came forth. There was
   then laid on his shoulders the heaviest burden; for many enemies must
   have risen to oppose him, when he attempted to bring back the people to
   the pure doctrine of the law, which the greater part were then treading
   under their feet.

   He calls himself the son of Hilkiah The Rabbins think that this Hilkiah
   was the priest by whom the Book of Moses was found five years after:
   but this seems not to me probable. The conjecture also of Jerome is
   very frivolous, who concludes that the Prophet was a boy when he began
   to prophesy, because he calls himself nr (nor,) a child, a little
   farther on, as though he did not use the word metaphorically. [6] At
   what age he was called to the prophetic office, we do not know; it is,
   however, probable that he was of mature age, for it was a work of high
   authority; and further, had he been a youth, doubtless such a miracle
   would not have been passed over in silence, that is, that he was made a
   prophet before the age of maturity.

   With regard to his father, it is nothing strange that the Rabbins have
   regarded him as the high priest; for we know that they are always prone
   to vain boastings. Ambition possessed them, and hence they have said
   that Jeremiah was the son of the high priest, in order to add to the
   splendor of his character. But what does the Prophet himself say? He
   declares indeed that he was the son of Hilkiah, but does not say that
   this was the high priest; on the contrary he adds, that he was from the
   priests who were in Anathoth in the land of Benjamin Now we know that
   this was a mean village, not far from Jerusalem; and Jeremiah says,
   that it was in the tribe of Benjamin. Its nearness to Jerusalem may be
   gathered from the words of Isaiah, who says that small Anathoth was
   terrified. (Isaiah 10:30) He threatened Jerusalem by saying that the
   enemy was near.

   "What," he says, "is your security? Ye can hear the noise of your
   enemies and the groans of your brethren from your very gates; for
   Anathoth is not far from you, being only three miles distant."

   Since then Jeremiah only says, that he came from Anathoth, why should
   we suppose him to be the sort of the high priest? And frivolous is what
   the Chaldee paraphraser adds here, that Hilkiah had possessions in the
   town of Anathoth, as though it was allowed the priests to possess land:
   God allowed them only what was necessary to feed their flocks. We may
   then take it as certain, and what the Prophet indeed expressly
   declares, that he came from the village of Anathoth. [7]

   He further says, that he was of the priestly order. Hence the prophetic
   office was more suitable to him than to many of the other prophets,
   such as Amos and Isaiah. God took Isaiah from the court, as he was of
   the royal family, and made him a prophet. Amos was in a different
   situation: he was taken from the shepherds, for he was a shepherd.
   Since God appointed such prophets over his Church, he no doubt thus
   intended to cast a reflection on the idleness and sloth of the priests.
   For, though all the priests were not prophets, yet they ought to have
   been taken from that order; for the priestly order was as it were the
   nursery of the prophets. But when gross want of knowledge and ignorance
   prevailed among them, God chose his prophets from the other tribes, and
   thus exposed and condemned the priests. They ought, indeed, to have
   been the messengers of the God of hosts, so as to keep the law in their
   lips, that the people might seek it from their mouth, according to what
   is said by Malachi. (Malachi 2:7) But as they were dumb dogs, God
   transferred the honor of the prophetic office to others; but Jeremiah,
   as I have already stated, was a prophet as well as a priest.

   He begins in the second verse to speak of his calling. [8] It would
   have, indeed, been to little purpose, had he said that he came forth
   and brought a message; but he explains, in the second verse, that he
   brought nothing but what had been delivered to him by God, as though he
   had said, that he faithfully declared what God had commanded him. For
   we know that the whole authority belongs entirely to God, with regard
   to the doctrine of religion, and that it is not in the power of men to
   blend this or that, and to make the faithful subject to themselves. As
   God, then, is the only true teacher of the Church, whosoever demands to
   be heard, must prove that he is God's minister. This is, then, what
   Jeremiah is now carefully doing, for he says that the word of Jehovah
   was given to him.

   He had before said, the words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah; but any
   one of the people might have objected and said, "Why dost thou intrude
   thyself, as though any one is to be heard? for God claims this right to
   himself alone." Hence Jeremiah, by way of correction, subjoins, that
   the words were his, but that he was not the author of them, but the
   minister only. He says, then, that he only executed what God had
   commanded, for he had been the disciple of God himself, before he
   undertook the office of a teacher.

   As to the beginning of his time and its termination, it has been
   briefly shewn, why he says that he had been chosen a prophet in the
   thirteenth year of Josiah, and that he discharged his office till the
   eleventh year of Zedekiah.

   Now that Josiah is called the son of Amon, it is doubtful whether
   Josiah was properly his son. Amon began to reign in his twenty-second
   year, and reigned only two years. Josiah succeeded him in the eighth
   year of his age. If we number the years precisely, Josiah must have
   been born when Amon was in his sixteenth year; but it does not appear
   likely, that Amon was a father when he was sixteen years of age, for in
   this case he must have begotten a son in his fifteenth year; as the
   birth must have taken place nine months after. Then Josiah must have
   been begotten in the fifteenth year of Amon's age. It is hence a
   probable conclusion, that he was a son by law and not by nature,
   according to what is afterwards said of Zedekiah, that he was Josiah's
   son, because he was his successor, while he was, as many think, his
   nephew, a brother's son. But it was a common thing to call the
   successors of kings their sons, who were their sons by law, and not, as
   I have said, by nature. It now follows-
     __________________________________________________________________

   [6] The word does not properly mean a "child," as in our version, or
   "puer," as rendered by Calvin, but a youth, or rather a young man.
   Abraham's trained servants were thus called, Genesis 14:24, and his
   servant who dressed the calf for the angels, Genesis 18:7, and his
   "young men" who accompanied him to Mount Moriah, Genesis 22:5. Joshua
   had this name given him, when he was attending Moses at the tabernacle,
   Exodus 33:11. It is rendered "(neoteros)-a youth or a young man," by
   the Septuagint The most probable thing is, that he was, not as Adam
   Clarke supposes, about 14, but a young man verging on maturity. The
   length of time during which he prophesied, would lead us to conclude
   that he was young when he was appointed to his office. There are two
   remarkable resemblances between Jeremiah and Moses. They both made an
   excuse for declining the office to which God called them, and made a
   similar excuse. The other resemblance is what Lightfoot has noticed,
   that Moses was a teacher of the people for forty years before they
   entered the land of Canaan, and that Jeremiah was their teacher for
   forty years before they were banished from it and driven into exile. --
   Ed.

   [7] The reasons alleged against Jeremiah being the son of the high
   priest are by no means conclusive: indeed, all the circumstances being
   considered, the probability is in favor of that supposition. The family
   of the high priest resided no doubt at Anathoth; what is said in 1
   Kings 2:26, respecting Abiathar, is a proof of this. That the high
   priest resided at Jerusalem during the term of his office forms no
   objection; nor is the genealogy of the high priests as given in 1
   Chronicles 6:1-17, any objection; for though in verse 13, Azariah is
   said to be the son of Hilkiah, yet Jeremiah might have been one of his
   younger sons. Most commentators agree indeed with Calvin, -Gataker,
   Henry, Scott, Blayney, etc.; but they adduce no satisfactory reasons,
   sufficient to invalidate the opinion of the Rabbins and the intimation
   contained in the Targum: and this opinion is what the translators of
   the Geneva Bible have adopted. -- Ed.

   [8] The second verse begins with 'sr which Calvin renders "nempeeven,"
   and takes it in an exegetic sense: but this is not its meaning. Our
   version is no doubt correct, "to whom;" though there is no preposition
   before it, it is yet found before the personal pronoun "to him," that
   comes afterwards. It is an idiom of the language, and the very same
   exists in Welsh, in which the version is literally the same with the
   Hebrew a relative pronoun without a preposition followed by a personal
   pronoun with a preposition profixed to it. It would be literally in
   English, "whom the word of Jehovah came to him." The Welsh also retains
   the peculiarity of the Hebrew, in having prepositions prefixed to
   pronouns and attached to them, though this is not the case generally
   with nouns, Yr hwn y daeth gair Jehova atto. The verb too, as in the
   Hebrew, precedes its nominative; "came" is before "the word of
   Jehovah." It is rather singular that the Septuagint have rendered this
   relative by "hos -- as," which shews that the Hebrew idiom was not
   understood by them. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 1:4-5

   4. Then the word of the LORD came unto me, saying,

   4. Et fuit sermo Jehova ad me dicendo,

   5. Before I formed thee in the belly I knew thee; and before thou
   camest forth out of the womb I sanctified thee, and I ordained thee a
   prophet unto the nations.

   5. Antequam formarem to in utero novi to, et antequam egressus esses e
   vulva sanetificavi to, Prophetam in gentibus constituite.


   Here Jeremiah explains more fully what he had already mentioned that he
   had been called from above, for otherwise he would have presumptuously
   obtruded himself: for no one, as the Apostle says, takes this honor to
   himself; but the call of God alone raises up prophets and teachers to
   their dignity {see Hebrews 5:4}. Hence, that Jeremiah might secure
   attention, he declares that he had been called to the prophetic office,
   and that by the clear voice of God. For this purpose, he says, that
   this word was given him, Before I formed thee in the womb [9] I knew
   thee He introduces God as the speaker, that what he declares might be
   more emphatical, that it might be of more weight and more forcible:
   for, if he had said simply in his own person, that he had been made a
   prophet by God's voice, it would not have so much moved the hearers;
   but when he brings forward God as the speaker, there is necessarily
   more weight and force in what is said.

   I pass by here what might be more largely said on what is necessary in
   one's call, so that he may be attended to by God's people; for no one,
   by his own and private right, can claim this privilege of speaking, as
   I have already said, inasmuch as this is what belongs to God alone. But
   I have elsewhere spoken at large on the prophetic call; it is therefore
   enough now to point at such things as these as it were by the finger:
   and particular discussions must be sought elsewhere; for were I to
   dwell at large on every subject, my work would be endless. I will,
   therefore, according to my usual practice, give a brief exposition of
   this Prophet.

   Jeremiah then says, that he had been called by God, for this end, that
   he might on this account gain a hearing from the people. God declares
   that he knew Jeremiah before he formed him in the womb. This is not
   said specially of the Prophet, as though other men are unknown to God,
   but it is to be understood of the prophetic office, as though he had
   said, "Before I formed thee in the womb, I destined thee for this work,
   even that thou mayest undertake the burden of a teacher among the
   people." And the second part is a repetition, when he says, Before thou
   camest forth from the womb I sanctified thee Sanctification is the same
   as the knowledge of God: and thus we perceive that knowledge is not
   mere prescience, but that predestination, by which God chooses every
   single individual according to his own will, and at the same time
   appoints and also sanctifies him; for no one, as Paul declares, (2
   Corinthians 2:16,) is according to his own nature fitted for the work.
   Since then this fitness is the gratuitous gift of God, it is nothing
   strange that God declares that he had sanctified Jeremiah, as though he
   had said, "I formed thee man in the womb, and at the same time
   appointed thee for this particular work; and as it was not in thy power
   to bring with thee a qualification for the prophetic office, I formed
   thee not only a man, but a prophet." This is the import of the passage.

   But they refine too much, who think that the Prophet was sanctified
   from the womb as John the Baptist was, for the words mean no such
   thing; but only that is testified of Jeremiah, which Paul also affirms
   respecting himself in the first chapter of the Epistle to the
   Galatians, that he was known by God before he was born. Jeremiah then
   was not actually sanctified in the womb, but set apart according to
   God's predestination and hidden purpose; that is, God chose him then to
   be a Prophet. It may be asked, whether he was not chosen before the
   creation of the world? To this it may be readily answered, that he was
   indeed foreknown by God before the world was made; but Scripture
   accommodates itself to the measure of our capacities, when it speaks of
   the generation of any one: it is then the same as though God had said
   of Jeremiah, that he was formed man for this end that in due time he
   might come forth a Prophet.

   And no doubt the following clause is added exegetically, A prophet for
   the nations I made thee His sanctification, then, as I have said, was
   not real, but intimated that he was appointed a Prophet before he was
   born.

   It however seems strange that he was given a Prophet to the nations God
   designed him to be the minister of his Church; for he neither went to
   the Ninevites, as Jonah did, (Jonah 3:3,) nor traveled into other
   countries, but spent his labors only among the tribe of Judah; why then
   is it said that he was given as a Prophet to the nations? To this I
   answer, that though God appointed him especially for his Church, yet
   his teaching belonged to other nations, as we shall presently see, and
   very evidently, as we proceed; for he prophesied concerning the
   Babylonians, the Egyptians, and the Moabites; in short, he included all
   the nations who were nigh and known to the Jews. This was indeed as it
   were accidental: but though he was given as a Prophet especially to his
   own people, yet his authority extended to heathen nations. No doubt
   nations are mentioned, including many, in order that the power and
   dignity of his teaching might appear more evident. It follows-

   Jeremiah 1:6-7

   6. Then said I, Ah, Lord GOD! behold, I cannot speak: for I am a child.

   6. Et dixi, Ahah, Domine Jehova, ecce non novi loqui, quia puer ego.

   7. But the LORD said unto me, Say not, I am a child: for thou shalt go
   to all that I shall send thee, and whatsoever I command thee thou shalt
   speak.

   7. Et dixit Jehova ad me, Ne dicas, Puer ego (id est, sum puer,) quia
   ad quaecunque to misero, ibis, et quaeunque tibi praecepero, loqueris.


   After having spoken of his call, the Prophet adds, that he at first
   refused his office, and he states this for two reasons; first, that he
   might clear himself from every suspicion of rashness, for we know how
   much ambition prevails among men, according to what James intimates,
   that many wish to be teachers, (James 3:1) and there is hardly one who
   is not anxious to be listened to. Since, then, most men too readily
   assume the office of teaching, and many boldly intrude into it,
   Jeremiah, in order to avoid the very suspicion of rashness, informs us
   that he was constrained to take the office. Secondly, he says that he
   refused the office, that he might gain more esteem, and render his
   disciples more attentive. But why did he refuse to obey God, when
   called to the prophetic function? Because its difficulty frightened
   him: and yet this very reason ought to rouse readers to a greater
   attention, as it no doubt awakened hearers when Jeremiah spoke to them.

   If any one asks, whether Jeremiah acted rightly in refusing what God
   enjoined? the answer is, that God pardoned his servant, for it was not
   his design to reject his call, or to exempt himself from obedience, or
   to shake off the yoke, because he regarded his own leisure, or his own
   fame, or any similar considerations: Jeremiah looked on nothing of this
   kind; but when he thought of himself, he felt, that he was wholly
   unequal to undertake an office so arduous. Hence the excuse that is
   added is that of modesty. We then see that God forgave his timidity,
   for it proceeded, as we have just said, from a right feeling; and we
   know that from good principles vices often arise. But it was yet a
   laudable thing in Jeremiah, that he thought himself not sufficiently
   qualified to undertake the prophetic office, and that he wished to be
   excused, and that another should be chosen endued with more courage and
   with better qualifications. I shall proceed with what remains tomorrow.

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast not only provided for thine
   ancient Church, by choosing Jeremiah as thy servant, but hast also
   designed that the fruit of his labors should contilme to our age, O
   grant that we may not be unthankful to thee, but that we may so avail
   ourselves of so great a benefit, that the fruit of it may appear in us
   to the glory of thy name; may we learn so entirely to devote ourselves
   to thy service, and each of us be so attentive to the work of his
   calling, that we may strive with united hearts to promote the honor of
   thy name, and also the kingdom of thine only -- begotten Son, until we
   finish our warfare, and come at length into that celestial rest, which
   has been obtained for us by the blood of thine only Son. Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lecture Second

   We mentioned yesterday the reason why Jeremiah refused the office of
   teaching, even because he thought himself unequal to the work; and for
   this reason he called himself a child, not in age, but in knowledge.
   Hence the word "child" is to be taken metaphorically; for thereby the
   Prophet confessed that he was not sufficiently qualified as to
   knowledge and practice. Some, as I have said, have unwisely applied
   this to his age. Though then he was of a mature age, yet he called
   himself a child, because of his unskillfulness, and because he
   possessed not the gifts necessary for an office so important. [10]

   Now follows the answer given to him, Say not, I am a child; for thou
   shalt go, etc. God not only predicts here what the Prophet was to do,
   but declares also what he designed him to do, and what he required from
   him, as though he had said, "It is thy duty to obey, because I have the
   right to command: thou must, therefore, go wheresoever I shall send
   thee, and thou must also proclaim whatsoever I shall command thee." By
   these words God reminds him that he was his servant, and that there was
   no reason why a sense of his own weakness should make him afraid; for
   it ought to have been enough for him simply to obey his command.

   And it is especially necessary to know this doctrine: for as we ought
   to undertake nothing without considering what our strength is, so when
   God enjoins anything, we ought, immediately to obey his word as it were
   with closed eyes. Prudence is justly praised by writers; and it is what
   ought to be attended to by all generally; they ought to consider what
   the shoulders can bear, and cannot bear. For whence is it that many
   have so much audacity and boldness, except that they hurry on through
   extreme self -- confidence? Hence, in all undertakings, this should be
   the first thing, that every one should weigh well his own strength, and
   take in hand what comports with the measure of his capacity. Then no
   one would foolishly obtrude himself, and arrogate to himself more than
   what is right. But when God calls us, we ought to obey, however
   deficient we may in all things be: and this is what we learn from what
   God says here, Say not, I am a child; that is, "though thou, indeed,
   thinkest thyself destitute of every qualification, though thou art
   conscious of thine own weakness, yet thou shalt go, thou must go
   wheresoever I shall send thee." God, then, requires this honor to be
   simply conceded to him, that men should obey his commands, though the
   qualification necessary to execute them be wanting. It afterwards
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [10] The words admit of two meanings. l'-ydty dvr-I have not known
   word, or, I know not word. The phrase may signify, I have no word to
   say, or, I know not how to say a word. The first meaning is what the
   context seems to countenance. The answer given to him refers to his two
   objections -- that he had no word to say, and that he was a young man.
   The last is first answered, according to the usual mode of writing
   adopted by the prophets, "To every one whom I shall send thee to, thou
   shalt go;" and then the first objection is removed, "and everything
   that I shall command thee, thou shalt speak." The answer goes on, and
   refers to the points in the same order, "Fear not;" and then to remedy
   the want complained of; Jehovah is represented as putting his words in
   his mouth, so that he might have what was necessary for him to say. God
   promised courage though he was young, and gave him a message to
   deliver: thus his two objections were removed. We meet with a similar
   phrase in Jeremiah 6:15; Jeremiah 8:12, which is, literally, "and shame
   they know not." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 1:8

   8. Be not afraid of their faces: for I am with thee to deliver thee,
   saith the LORD.

   8. Ne timeas a facie ipsorum, quia tecum ego (id est, ego sum tecum) ad
   eripiendum to, dicit Jehova.


   We may learn from this verse that Jeremiah, when he observed the heavy
   and hard conflicts he had to undertake, was greatly disturbed; for he
   had not courage enough firmly and boldly to assail enemies so many and
   so violent. He indeed saw, that he had to do with a degenerated people,
   who had almost all departed from the law of God: and since they had for
   many years shaken off the yoke, and were petulantly exulting in their
   freedom, it was difficult to bring them back to obedience, and to a
   right course of life. It hence appears that the Prophet was restrained
   by this difficulty, so as not to venture to undertake the prophetic
   office. But God applied a suitable remedy to his fear; for what does he
   say? Fear not their face It appears, then, that when Jeremiah said that
   he was a child, he had in view, as I have already hinted, the
   difficulty of the undertaking; he could hardly bear to carry on
   contests so severe with that rebellious people, who had now become
   hardened in their wickedness. We hence see how he refused, in an
   indirect manner, the burden laid on him, for he ventured, not openly
   and ingenuously, and in plain words, to confess how the matter was; but
   God, who penetrates into the hearts of men, and knows all their hidden
   feelings and motives, heals his timidity by saying, Fear not their
   face. [11]

   Now this passage shews that corruptions had so prevailed among the
   chosen people, that no servant of God could peaceably perform his
   office. When prophets and teachers have to do with a teachable people,
   they have no need to fight: but when there is no fear of God, and no
   regard for him, yea, when men are led away by the violence of their
   lusts, no godly teacher can exercise his duty without being prepared
   for war. This, then, is what God intimates, when he bids his Prophet to
   be courageous; for he saw that there would be as many enemies as
   professed themselves to be the children of Abraham.

   The reason, also, for boldness and confidence, that is added, ought to
   be noticed, For I am with thee to deliver thee By these words God
   reminds the Prophet, that there would be sufficient protection in his
   power, so that he had no need to dread the fury of his own nation. It
   was, indeed, at first, a formidable undertaking, when Jeremiah saw that
   he had to carry on war, not with a few men, but with the whole people;
   but God sets himself in opposition to all men, and says, I am with
   thee, [12] fear not. We hence see that due honor is then conceded to
   God, when being content with his defense we disregard the fury of men,
   and hesitate not to contend with all the ungodly, yea, though they may
   rise up in a mass against us: and were their forces and power the
   strongest, we ought yet to feel assured that the defense of God alone
   is sufficient to protect us. This is the full meaning of the passage.
   It now follows-
     __________________________________________________________________

   [11] The proper rendering is, "Fear not before them," or, on their
   account: smny is invariably a preposition, before, from before, because
   of, on account of, for, by, through; Deuteronomy 2:21; Exodus 14:19;
   Deuteronomy 7:19; Jeremiah 6:13; and it is often, though not always, so
   rendered in our version. The very same phrase is found in Joshua 11:6,
   and rendered, "Be not afraid, because of them;" and also in this book,
   Jeremiah 41:18, "They were afraid of them." It may, indeed, be
   rendered, "Fear them not," or, "Be not afraid of them." To introduce
   "face" or "faces" is by no means right. Gataker's rendering is, "Fear
   not before them;" and Blayney's, "Be not thou afraid because of them."
   -- Ed

   [12] "Earthly kings and sovereigns," observes Gataker on this verse,
   "are not wont to go with those whom they send on embassage; God goeth
   along with those whom he sends, and is by his powerful protection, at
   all times and in all places, present with them." -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 1:9-10

   9. Then the LORD put forth his hand, and touched my mouth. And the LORD
   said unto me, Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth.

   9. Et extendit Jehova manum suam, et tetigit os meum; et dixit Jehova
   ad me, Ecce posui verba mea in ore tuo:

   10. See, I have this day set thee over the nations and over the
   kingdoms, to root out, and to pull down, and to destroy, and to throw
   down, to build, and to plant.

   10. Vide, constitui to (vel, praefeci) hodie super gentes et super
   regna, ad evellendum et ad destruendum et ad eruendum et ad perdendum,
   ad aedificandum et ad plantandum.


   Here Jeremiah speaks again of his calling, that his doctrine might not
   be despised, as though it proceeded from a private individual. He,
   therefore, testifies again, that he came not of himself, but was sent
   from above, and was invested with the authority of a prophet. For this
   purpose he says, that God's words were put in his mouth.

   This passage ought to be carefully observed; for Jeremiah briefly
   describes how a true call may be ascertained, when any one undertakes
   the office of a teacher in the Church: it is ascertained even by this
   when he brings nothing of his own, according to what Peter says in his
   first canonical epistle,

   "Let him who speaks, speak as the oracles of God,"
   (1 Peter 4:11)

   that is, let him not speak doubtingly, as though he introduced his own
   glosses; but let him boldly, and without hesitation, speak in the name
   of God. So also Jeremiah in this place, in order that he might demand
   to be heard, plainly declares that the words of God were put in his
   mouth. Let us, then, know, that whatever proceeds from the wit of man,
   ought to be disregarded; for God wills this honor to be conceded to him
   alone, as it was stated yesterday, to be heard in his own Church. It
   hence follows, that none ought to be acknowledged as God's servants,
   that no prophets or teachers ought to be counted true and faithful,
   except those through whom God speaks, who invent nothing themselves,
   who teach not according to their own fancies, but faithfully deliver
   what God has committed to them.

   A visible symbol was added, that there might be a stronger
   confirmation: but there is no reason to make this a general rule, as
   though it were necessary that the tongues of all teachers should be
   touched by the hand of God. There are here two things -- the thing
   itself, and the external sign. As to the thing itself, a rule is
   prescribed to all God's servants, that they bring not their own
   inventions, but simply deliver, as from hand to hand, what they have
   received from God. But it was a special thing as to Jeremiah, that God,
   by stretching out his hand, touched his mouth; it was, that he might
   openly shew that his mouth was consecrated to himself. It is therefore
   sufficient as to the ministers of the word, that their tongues be
   consecrated to God, so that they may not mix any of their own fictions
   with his pure doctrine. But it was God's will, as to Jeremiah, to add
   also the visible signs of the thing itself, by extending his hand and
   touching his mouth.

   God having now shewn that Jeremiah's mouth was consecrated to himself,
   and separated from common and profane use, proceeds to invest him with
   power: See, he says, I have set thee this day over nations and over
   kingdoms By these words God shews how reverently he would have his word
   received, even when conveyed by frail mortals. There is no one who
   pretends not, that he desires to obey God, but yet hardly one in a
   hundred really receives his word. For as soon as he speaks, almost all
   raise a clamor; or if they dare not furiously, and in a hostile manner,
   oppose it, we yet see how some evade it, and others secretly oppose it.
   The authority, then, which God ascribes to his own word, ought to be
   noticed by us: Behold, I have set thee over nations and kingdoms

   Farther, by saying, See, I have set thee, he encourages the Prophet to
   be magnanimous in spirit. He was to remember his calling, and not
   timidly or servilely to flatter men, or to shew indulgence to their
   lusts and passions: See, he says. We may hence perceive, that teachers
   cannot firmly execute their office except they have the majesty of God
   before their eyes, so that in comparison with him they may disregard
   whatever splendor, pomp, or power there may be in men. Experience
   indeed teaches us, that the sight of men, whatever dignity they may
   possess, be it the least, brings fear with it. Why are prophets and
   teachers sent? That they may reduce the world to order: they are not to
   spare their hearers, but freely reprove them whenever there may be
   need; they are also to use threatenings when they find men perverse.
   But when there is any dignity connected with men, the teacher dares not
   to offend; he is afraid of those who are invested with power, or who
   possess wealth, or a high character for prudence, or who are endued
   with great honors. In such cases there is no remedy, except teachers
   set God before their eyes, and regard him to be himself the speaker.
   They may thus with courageous and elevated minds look down on whatever
   height and pre -- eminence there may be among mortals. This, then, is
   the object of what God says here, See, I have set thee over nations and
   kingdoms; for he shews that there is so much authority in his word,
   that whatever is high and exalted on earth is made subject to it; even
   kings are not excepted.

   But what God has joined together let no man separate. (Matthew 19:6;
   Mark 10:9) God indeed extols here his Prophets above the whole world,
   and even above kings; but he has previously said, Behold, I have put my
   words, in thy mouth; so that whosoever claims such a power, must
   necessarily bring forth the word of God, and really prove that he is a
   prophet, and that he introduces no fictions of his own. And hence we
   see how fatuitous is the boasting of the Pope, and of his filthy
   clergy, when they wickedly dare to appropriate to themselves what is
   here said. "We are, "they say, "above both kings and nations." By what
   right? "God hath thus spoken by the Prophet Jeremiah." But these two
   things are to be joined together -- I have put my words in thy mouth,
   and, I have set thee over nations and kingdoms Now let the Pope shew
   that he is furnished with the word of God, that he claims for himself
   nothing that is his own, of apart from God; in a word, that he
   introduces nothing of his own devices, and we shall willingly allow
   that he is pre -- eminent above the whole world. For God is not to be
   separated from his word: as his majesty shines eminently above the
   whole world, yea, and above all the angels of heaven; so there is the
   same dignity belonging to his word. But as these swine and dogs are
   empty of all true doctrine and piety, what effrontery it is, yea, what
   stupidity, to boast that they have authority over kings and nations!
   We, in short, see from the context, that men are not here so much
   extolled, though they be true ministers of celestial truth, as the
   truth itself; for God ascribes here the highest authority to his own
   word, though its ministers were men of no repute, poor and despised,
   and having nothing splendid connected with them. The purpose for which
   this was said I have already explained; it was, that true prophets and
   teachers may take courage, and thus boldly set themselves against kings
   and nations, when armed with the power of celestial truth.

   He then adds, To root up, to destroy, to pull down, to lay waste God
   seems here to have designedly rendered odious his own word and the
   ministry of the Prophet; for the word of God in the mouth of Jeremiah
   could not have been acceptable to the Jews, except they perceived that
   it was for their safety and welfare: but God speaks here of ruin and
   destruction, of cutting down and desolation. But he subjoins, to build
   and to plant God then ascribes two effects to his word, that on the one
   hand it destroys, pulls down, lays waste, cuts off; and that on the
   other it plants and builds

   But it may, however, be rightly asked, why does God at first speak of
   ruin and extermination? The order would have seemed better had he said
   first, I set thee to build and to plant, according to what is said by
   Paul, who declares that vengeance was prepared by him and the other
   teachers against all despisers, and against all the height of the
   world, when your obedience, he says, shall be completed. (2 Corinthians
   10:5, 6.) Paul then intimates that the doctrine of the gospel is
   properly, and in the first place, designed for this end -- to call men
   to the service of God. But Jeremiah here puts ruin and destruction
   before building and planting. It then seems, as I have said, that he
   acts inconsistently. But we must ever bear in mind what the state of
   the people was: for impiety, perverseness, and hardened iniquity had
   for so long a time prevailed, that it was necessary to begin with ruin
   and eradication; for Jeremiah could not have planted or have built the
   temple of God, except he had first destroyed, pulled down, laid waste,
   and cut off. How so? Because the Devil had erected there his palace;
   for as true religion had been for many years despised, the Devil was
   there placed, as it were, on his high throne, and reigned uncontrolled
   at Jerusalem, and through the whole land of Judea. How, then, could he
   have built there a temple for God, in which he might be purely
   worshipped, except ruin and destruction had preceded? for the Devil had
   corrupted the whole land. We indeed know that all kinds of wickedness
   then prevailed everywhere, as though the land had been filled with
   thorns and briers. Jeremiah then could not have planted or sown his
   heavenly doctrine until the land had been cleansed from so many vices
   and pollutions. This is no doubt the reason why in the first place he
   speaks of cutting off and ruin, of exterminating and eradicating, and
   afterwards adds planting and building.

   The heap of words employed shews how deep impiety and the contempt of
   God had fixed their roots. God might have said only, I have set thee to
   pull down and to destroy; he might have been content with two words, as
   in the latter instance -- to plant and to build. But as the Jews had
   been obstinate in their wickedness, as their insolence had been so
   great, they could not be corrected immediately, nor in one day, nor by
   a slight effort. Hence God accumulated words, and thus encouraged his
   Prophet to proceed with unwearied zeal in the work of clearing away the
   filth which had polluted the whole land. We now then understand what is
   here said, and the purpose of using so many words. [13]

   But he speaks again of kingdoms and nations; for though Jeremiah was
   given as a Prophet especially to his own nation, yet he was also a
   Prophet to heathen nations, as they say, by accident, according to what
   we shall hereafter see: and it seems that, God designedly mentioned
   nations and kingdoms, in order to humble the pride of that people who
   thought themselves exempt from all reproof. Hence he says, that he gave
   authority to his servant, not only over Judea, but also over the whole
   world; as though he had said, "Ye are but a small portion of mankind;
   raise not then your horns against my servant, as ye shall do this
   without effect; for he shall exercise power not only over Judea, but
   also over all nations, and even over kings, as the doctrine which I
   have deposited with him is of such force and power that it will stand
   eminent above all mortals, much more above one single nation."

   We at the same time see that though the treachery of men constrains God
   to use severity, yet he never forgets his own nature, and kindly
   invites to repentance those who are not wholly past remedy, and offers
   to them the hope of pardon and of salvation; and this is what celestial
   truth ever includes. For though it be the odour of death unto death to
   those who perish, it is yet the odor of life unto life to the elect of
   God. It indeed often happens that the greater part turn the doctrine of
   salvation to their ruin; yet God never suffers all to perish. He
   therefore makes the truth the incorruptible seed of life to his elect,
   and builds them up as his temples. This is what we must bear in mind.
   And so there is no reason why the truth of God should be disliked by
   us, though it be the occasion of perdition to many; for it always
   brings salvation to the elect: it so plants them, that they strike
   roots into the hope of a blessed immortality, and then it builds them
   for holy temples unto God. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [13] The whole of this verse is arranged according to the usual manner
   of the Prophets. The word "nations" comes first, and then "kingdoms."
   Three lines follow; the first word in each line refers to "kingdoms,"
   and the last to "nations." The v, vau, in the second line is omitted in
   many copies, and there seems to be no need of it; and it is not true
   what Blayney says, that there are MSS. which supply the v before the
   last line, though it be supplied by the Septuagint To preserve the
   distinct meaning of each verb, I offer the following rendering: -- See,
   I have set thee this day
   Over nations and over kingdoms,
   To root up, and to break down,
   To destroy, and to erase,
   To build up, and to plant. He was to root up kingdoms, and to break
   down nations; then he adds stronger words, for he was to destroy, or
   wholly to destroy kingdoms, and to erase or to obliterate nations. The
   reason for the repetition is well stated by Calvin. As to his other
   work, two words only are used: he was to build up kingdoms, and to
   plant nations. A nation, of course, exists before a kingdom, and this
   order is observed in the second line; but the order, as it is usual
   with the sacred writers, not only of the Old, but also of the New
   Testament, is then reversed. See an instance in Romans 10:9, 10, where
   indeed the true order is given last, the ostensible act being in the
   first instance stated, and then the principle from which it proceeds.

   Jeremiah 1:11-12

   11. Moreover, the word of the LORD came unto me, saying, Jeremiah, what
   seest thou? And I said, I see a rod of an almond tree.

   11. Et (hoc est, postea) factus est sermo Jehovae ad me (datus est
   mihi, fuit, ad verbum,) dicendo, Quid tu vides, Jeremia? Et dixi,
   Baculum vigilis (aut, amigdali) ego video.

   12. Then said the LORD unto me, Thou hast well seen: for I will hasten
   my word to perform it.

   12. Et dixit Jehova ad me, Bene fecisti ad videndam (hoc est, recte
   vidisti,) quia vigilo (aut, festino, vigilans ego, ad verbum) super
   sermonem meum ut ipsum faciam (hoc est, ut compleam.)


   God confirms in this passage what he had previously said of the power
   of his word. These two verses, then, are to be taken as explanatory,
   for no new subject is introduced; but the former part is confirmed --
   that the Prophets spoke not in vain, or to no purpose, because they
   were invested with celestial power to plant and to build, and, on the
   other hand, to pull down and to root up, according to what we have
   quoted from Paul, who says that true teachers are armed with such
   power. (2 Corinthians 10:5, 6) We have in readiness, he says, vengeance
   against all the unbelieving, however proud they may be: and though
   their height may terrify the whole world, yet we have a sword in our
   hands which will stay them; for God's word has sufficient power to
   destroy the rebellious.

   God then proceeds with the same subject when he says, What seest thou,
   Jeremiah? He had set before him a staff or a rod of almond, as some
   render the word: and sqr, shaked, means an almond; but as it comes from
   a verb which means to watch or to hasten, we cannot fitly render it
   here, almond. I do not, however, deny that the Hebrew word has this
   meaning. But it is written here with Kamets; the participle which
   afterwards follows has Holem: we hence see what affinity there is
   between the two words. The word sqr, shaked, an almond, is derived from
   the verb, sqr, shakad, to watch; and it has been thought that this tree
   is so called, because it brings forth fruit earlier than other trees;
   for almonds, as it is well known, flower even in winter, and in the
   coldest seasons. Now, were we to say in Latin, I see a rod or a staff
   of almond; and were the answer given, Thou hast rightly seen, for I
   watch, the allusion in the words would not appear, the sentence would
   lose its beauty, and there would indeed be no meaning. It is hence
   necessary to give another version, except we wish to pervert the
   passage, and to involve the Prophet's meaning in darkness. It should
   be, "I see the rod, "or the staff, "of a watcher." Let us grant that
   the almond is intended; yet the tree may be called watchful, according
   to what etymology requires, and also the sense of the passage, as all
   must see. [14]

   God then caused his servant to see the staff of a watcher. For what
   purpose? The answer is given: Thou hast rightly seen the staff of a
   watcher, because I watch over my word to execute (or, fulfill) it
   Interpreters seem to have unwisely confined this to the punishments
   afterwards mentioned: they think that what is intimated is, that the
   threatenings which the Prophet announced would not be without effect,
   because God was prepared to inflict whatever he would denounce. But
   this, as I think, is too restricted a view; for God, I have no doubt,
   extols here his own word, and speaks of its accomplishment; as though
   he had said, that he spoke not by his servants, that what they said
   might vanish into air, or fall to the ground, but that power would
   accompany it, according to what is said in Isaiah,

   "Not return shall my word to me empty, but shall prosper in all
   things," (Isaiah 55:11)

   that is, "I will cause the prophetic doctrine to take effect, that the
   whole world may know that I have not spoken in vain, and that my word
   is not an empty sound, but that it has real power, which in due time
   will appear."

   Hence I have said that these verses ought to be connected with the
   last, in which God said, that he sent his Prophet to root up and to
   plant, to demolish and to build. He then gives a proof of this in other
   words, and says that he would watch over his word, that he might
   execute whatever he had announced by his servants; as though he had
   said, "I indeed allot their parts (so to speak) to the prophets; but as
   they speak from my mouth, I am present with them to fulfill whatever I
   command them." In short, God intimates that the might and the power of
   his hand would be connected with the word, of which the prophets were
   ministers among men. Thus it is a general declaration which refers not
   only to punishments, but also to promises. Rightly, then, hast thou
   seen, he says; for I am watching.

   God does not here resign his own office to Jeremiah, though he employs
   him as his teacher; for he shews that the power to accomplish what the
   Prophet would declare remained with him. God indeed does not here
   ascribe to Jeremiah anything as his own, or apart from himself, but
   sets forth only the power of his word; as though he had said, "Provided
   thou be my faithful minister, I will not frustrate thy hope, nor the
   hope of those who shall obey thee; for I will fulfill whatever thou and
   they may justly hope for: nor shall they escape unpunished who shall
   resist thee; for I will in due time bring on them the punishment they
   deserve."

   He therefore uses the word to watch, or to hasten, in order to shew
   that he stood ready to give effect to his word at the appointed time.
   The effect does not indeed always appear to us: it is on this account
   said by Habakkuk, that if prophecy delays, we are to wait;

   "for it will not be," he says,
   "beyond its time; but coming it will come." (Habakkuk. 2:3)

   God then bids us with quiet minds to wait for the accomplishment of his
   word; but he afterwards adds, in order to modify what he had said,
   "coming it will come;" that is, "I will accomplish and really perform
   whatever my prophets have spoken by my command." So there shall be no
   delay, for the suitable time depends on God's will, and not on the
   judgment of men. It then follows, -- but as the clock strikes, I cannot
   proceed farther today.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [14] The word is rendered "a rod of almond" by the Septuagint, the
   Arabic version, and Theodotion; and also by Piscator, Drusius, Grotius,
   and Blayney; and "the rod of the watcher" by Sym., Aq., and the Vulgate
   The latter is no doubt more suitable in a translation. Some conclude,
   from what is related in Numbers 17, that the head of each tribe carried
   a wand or a staff made of the almond tree as a token of watchfulness:
   if so, the probability is, that this wand was presented to the view of
   the Prophet. It being a well-known emblem of watchfulness, and called
   perhaps the watchful rod or staff, it was most suitable to the purposes
   here designed. The verb sqd does not mean to hasten, but to watch, or
   to be awake. Then the version of the passage would be the following: -
   11. And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, "What seest thou,
   Jeremiah?" and I said, "The rod of a watcher is what I see." 12. Then
   Jehovah said to me, "Thou seest rightly, for I am watching over my word
   to do it." -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou art pleased kindly to invite us to
   thyself, and hast consecrated thy word for our salvation, -- O grant
   that we may willingly, and from the heart, obey thee, and become so
   teachable, that what thou hast designed for our salvation may not turn
   to our perdition; but may that incorruptible seed by which thou dost
   regenerate us into a hope of the celestial life so drive its roots into
   our hearts, and bring forth fruit, that thy name may be glorified; and
   may we be so planted in the courts of thine house, that we may grow and
   flourish, and that fruit may appear through the whole course of our
   life, until we shall at length enjoy that blessed life which is laid up
   for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 1:13-14

   13. And the word of the LORD came unto me the second time, saying, What
   seest thou? And I said, I see a seething pot; and the face thereof is
   toward the north.

   13. Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad me secundo, dicendo, Quid tu rides? Et
   dixi, Ollam ferventem ego video, facies ejus a facie Aquilonis.

   14. Then the LORD said unto me, Out of the north an evil shall break
   forth upon all the inhabitants of the land.

   14. Et dixit Jehova ad me, Ab Aquilone aperietur (alii vertunt,
   pendetur; alii, solvetur; erumpet, proprie) malum super cunctos
   habitatores terrae.


   Jeremiah begins now to address the people to whom he was sent as a
   Prophet. He has hitherto spoken of his calling, that the authority of
   his doctrine might be evident: and he spoke generally; but now he
   accommodates his teaching specially to the people. Hence he says, that
   he had a vision, and saw a boiling-pot, whose face was towards the
   north. By God asking, and the Prophet answering, the design was to
   confirm the prediction; for if it had been only said that he saw a
   boiling-pot, and if an explanation of the metaphor had been given,
   there would not have been so much force and weight in the narrative.
   But when God is set forth as being present, and explaining what the
   boiling-pot signified, the prediction becomes more certain: and the
   Prophet no doubt gave this narrative, in order to shew that God, being
   as it were present, thereby proved himself to he the Author of this
   prophecy.

   Now the import of the whole is, that the Chaldeans would come to
   overthrow the city Jerusalem, to take away and abolish all the honor
   and dignity both of the kingdom and of the priesthood.

   This indeed had been previously announced by Isaiah as well as by other
   prophets; but all their threatenings had been despised. While indeed
   Isaiah was living, the king of Babylon had secured the friendship of
   Hezekiah; and the Jews thought that his protection had been opportunely
   obtained against the Assyrians. But they did not consider that the
   hearts of men are ruled by the hand of God, and are turned as he
   pleases: nor did they consider that they had for many years provoked
   God, and that he was become their enemy. Since, then, all threatening
   had been despised and regarded with derision, Jeremiah came forth and
   declared, that the northern nations would come, the Assyrians as well
   as the Chaldeans. For we know that the one monarchy had been swallowed
   up by the other; and the Chaldeans ruled over the Assyrians; and thus
   it happened that the whole eastern empire, with the exception of the
   Medes and Persians, had passed over to them; and with respect to Judea,
   they were northward. Hence the Prophet says, that he saw a boiling-pot,
   having its face towards the north.

   By the pot many understand the king of Babylon; but they seem not
   rightly to understand what the Prophet says: and I could easily
   disprove their interpretation, but I shall be satisfied with a simple
   statement of what is true; and the meaning will become evident as we
   proceed. The pot, then, as it will be presently seen more clearly, is
   the nation of the Jews: I say this now, as I do not wish to heap
   together too many things. They are said to be like a boiling-pot,
   because the Lord, as it were, boiled them, until they were reduced
   almost to nothing. It is said also, that the face of the pot was
   towards the north; because there, as Jeremiah immediately explains, was
   the fire kindled. And the comparison is very apposite; for when a pot
   is set on the fire, it boils on that side nearest the fire, and all the
   scum passes over to the other side. Hence he says that it boiled, but
   so that its mouth was on the north side; for there was the fire, and
   there was the blowing. In short, God intended to shew to his Prophet,
   that the people were like flesh which is cast into the pot, boiled, and
   afterwards burnt, or reduced after a long time almost to nothing. The
   Prophet saw the mouth or the face of the boiling-pot, and on the side
   on which it boiled it looked towards the north; hence God, the
   interpreter of the vision which he presented to his servant, answers
   and says, From the north shall break forth evil on all the inhabitants
   of the land, that is, of Judea. In these words God declares, that the
   fire was already kindled by the Chaldeans and the Assyrians, by which
   he would boil, as it were, his people like flesh, and at length wholly
   consume them, as it is commonly the case, when the flesh remains in the
   pot, and the fire is continually burning, and blowing is also added;
   the flesh must necessarily be reduced to nothing when thus boiled or
   seethed. [15]

   And thus God testifies that the fire was already kindled in Chaldea and
   Assyria, which was not only to boil the Jews, but also reduce them to
   nothing. And then he expresses the same in other words -- that evil
   would come from the north upon all the Jews. We shall hereafter see
   that there is presented here a brief summary of the truth which was
   committed to Jeremiah; at least it is a summary of one half of it; for
   God designed also to provide for his own elect; and he thus terrified
   them, that they might be subdued, and submit to him, and not that they
   might abandon themselves to despair. At the same time, this half of the
   prediction was -- that there was no hope of pardon, because the Jews
   had with extreme obstinacy provoked God's wrath, and had so abused his
   patience, that their impiety could no longer be tolerated. Hence, what
   other prophets had denounced Jeremiah now confirms more strongly, and
   points it out, as it were, by the finger. It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [15] Most agree with Calvin, that the pot means the Jewish nation; so
   the learned Gataker in the Ass. Ann., Grotius, Henry, and Scott. There
   is some difference as to "its face." The first of these authors,
   followed by the two last, thinks that the face means the front of the
   fire or the hearth, and therefore the front of the pot. This face or
   front was towards the north, signifying that the fuel and the blowing
   would be from that quarter, as it is afterwards stated. As to the
   metaphor, the pot, or cauldron, see Ezekiel 11:3, 7; 24:3, 5. The
   version of the Geneva Bible is, "I see a seething-pot looking out of
   the north;" and the Chaldean army is regarded as the pot: and Blayney,
   following the marginal reading of our version, has given a similar
   rendering, "and the face thereof is turned from the north." But mphny
   is a preposition, and rendered often, "from before," and, "before,"
   (see [2]note on verse 8;) and to say that its face was before the north
   means the same as towards the north: and this is the rendering of Jun.
   and Trem , and Piscator, "versus Aquilonem." "The boiling-pot" is a pot
   "kindled under-hupokaiomenon," by the Sept The literal rendering of syr
   nphvch is, "a pot blown," meaning the fire under it. It was a pot set
   on a fire that was blown, and the front of it was toward the north,
   from whence the blowing came. The same word as a noun is used by
   Jeremiah in Jeremiah 6:29, and signifies an instrument for blowing, and
   is rendered "bellows" in our version. It was then a pot set on a fire
   that was blown, which intimated the severe calamities which the Jews
   were soon to endure, as Grotius observes. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 1:15

   15. For, lo, I will call all the families of the kingdoms of the north,
   saith the LORD; and they shall come, and they shall set every one his
   throne at the entering of the gates of Jerusalem, and against all the
   walls thereof round about, and against all the cities of Judah.

   15. Quoniam ecce ego voco omnes familias regnorum Aquilonis, dicit
   Jehova, et venient; ponent quisque solium suum in ostio postarum
   Jerosolymae, et super omnes muros ejus in circuitu, et super omnes
   urbes Jehudah.


   This verse contains an explanation of the last; for God more dearly and
   more specifically expresses what he had before referred to -- that the
   evil would come from the north. He says that he would be the sender of
   this evil, and speaks thus of it: Behold, I call all the families of
   the kingdoms of the north The prediction would not have been so
   effectual had not this declaration been expressly added -- that the
   Chaldeans would come by the authority of God; for men are ever wont to
   ascribe to fortune whatever takes place: and we shall hereafter see in
   the Book of Lamentations (Lamentations 3:37, 38) that the Jews were so
   besotted, that in their calamities they attributed to the events of
   fortune the destruction of the temple and city, and the ruin of the
   kingdom. Hence God sharply expostulated with them, because they were so
   blind in a matter so clear, and did not acknowledge his judgments. The
   Prophet, then, after having testified that the evil would come from the
   north, now adds, that this evil would by no means be by chance, but
   through that war which the Chaldeans would bring on them; that God
   would be the chief commander, who would gather soldiers from all parts,
   and prepare an army to destroy the Jews.

   The Prophet uses the word, to cry: Behold, he says, I will cry to all
   the kindreds, or families, etc. [16] God employs various modes of
   speaking, when he intends to teach us that all nations are in his hand,
   and subject to his will, so that he can excite wars whenever it pleases
   him. He says, "Behold, I will hiss (or whistle) for the Egyptians;" and
   he compares them sometimes to bees. (Isaiah 5:26; Isaiah 7:18.) Again,
   in another place he says, "Behold, I will blow with the trumpet, and
   assemble shall the Assyrians." All these modes of speaking are intended
   to shew, that though men make a great stir, and disturb the whole
   world, yet God directs all things by his sovereign power, and that
   nothing takes place except under his guidance and authority. We then
   see that the Prophet does not speak as an historian; nor does he simply
   predict what was to be, but also adds a doctrine or a great truth. It
   would have been a naked prediction only, had he said, "An evil shall
   break forth from the north: "but he now, as I have already said,
   performs the office of a teacher, that his prediction might be useful,
   and says that God would be the chief commander in that war: Behold,
   then, I will cry to all the families [17] of the kingdoms of the north.

   There was then indeed but one monarchy; but as the self -- confidence
   of the Jews was so great, and hence their sottishness, so that they
   dreaded no evil, God, in order to arouse them, says that he would
   assemble all the families of the kingdoms: and doubtless those belonged
   to many kingdoms whom God brought together against the Jews. A regard
   also was had to that vain confidence which the Jews entertained, in
   thinking that the Egyptians would be ever ready to supply them with
   help. As, then, they were wont to set up the Egyptians as their shield,
   or even as a mountain, God here exposes their folly, -- that trusting
   in the Egyptians, they thought themselves sufficiently fortified
   against the power and arms of the whole Chaldean monarchy. For these
   reasons, then, he mentions the families, and then the kingdoms, of the
   north.

   It follows, And they shall come, and set each (man, literally) his
   throne [18] at the entrance of the gates The Prophet here means that
   the power of the Chaldeans would be such, that they would boldly pitch
   their tents before the gates, and not only so, but would also close up
   the smaller gates, for he mentions the doors (ostia) of the gates [19]
   And by speaking of each of them, he meant the more sharply to touch the
   Jews: for they, relying on the help of Egypt, thought themselves
   capable of resisting, while yet the Chaldeans, who had conquered the
   Assyrians, would be irresistible. Hence he says, that not only the army
   itself would encamp before the gates, but that each individual would
   fix himself there, and set up his tent as in a place of safety. In
   short, God intimates that the Chaldeans and Assyrians would be
   victorious, that they would entirely rule and rest themselves as at
   their own homes, in the fields and before the gates of the city
   Jerusalem. These things are afterwards more distinctly expressed, and
   many circumstances are added: but God intended at first to announce
   this declaration, that the Jews might know that it would be all over
   with them.

   He then says, On its walls around, and on all the cities of Judah The
   Prophet here declares, that the whole country would be laid waste, as
   though he had said, "The Jews in vain trust to their own resources, and
   help from others, for God will fight against them; and as the Chaldeans
   and the Assyrians shall be armed by him, they shall be victorious,
   whatever force the Jews may oppose to them." It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [16] Perhaps the more literal rendering would be, "I will call to," or
   for. The version of Septuagint is, "sunkalo-I will summon;" of
   Vatablus, "invitabo -- I will invite;" of Piscator, "vocabo -- I will
   call;" and of Blayney, "I will call for." -- Ed

   [17] They are called "families," say some, because kings are called
   fathers; but probable it is a mode of speaking retained from primitive
   times, as we find that those called "families" in Genesis 12:3, are
   called "nations" in Genesis 22:18. -- Ed.

   [18] The original word, ks', not only means a throne, but a seat; see 1
   Samuel 1:9; 1 Samuel 4:18; and 2 Kings 4:10, where it is rendered in
   our version "a stool." Grotius renders it here "praetorium castrense --
   a camp's tent." The "throne" is derived from the Septuagint. -- Ed

   [19] Literally it is "The opening of the gates." The preposition at is
   not in the original; and the word in some other places is found without
   it. See Genesis 19:11; Genesis 43:17. The preposition epi is given by
   the Septuagint, "epi ta prothura-at or in the vestibules," etc. We have
   the fulfillment of this expressly recorded in Jeremiah 39:3. The idea
   suggested by Adam Clarke, that they would sit as judges in the gates,
   as these were the courts of justice, is evidently not intended here;
   for they would also fix their tents or their seats by or on the walls,
   and in all the cities of Judah. The latter portion of the verse may be
   thus rendered, -- And they shall come, and set, each his seat,
   At the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem,
   And on all its walls around,
   And on all the cities of Judah. The description betokens an entire
   possession of the whole land. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 1:16

   16. And I will utter my judgments against them touching all their
   wickedness, who have forsaken me, and have burnt incense unto other
   gods, and worshipped the works of their own hands.

   16. Et loquar (vel, proferam) judicia mea cum ipsis super omni malitia
   eorum; quia (nam 'sr hic ponitur vice ky valet causalem particulam,
   quia) dereliquerunt me, et suffitum fecerunt diis alienis et prostrati
   fuerunt (vel, se prostraverunt) coram operibus manuum suarum.


   God now assigns the reason why he had resolved to deal so severely with
   the Jews. It was necessary to teach them two things, -- first, that the
   Chaldeans would not of themselves come upon them, but through God, who
   would gather and arm them; and secondly, that God Would not act in a
   cruel manner, nor forget his covenant, in becoming a rigid avenger, but
   that he would thus be angry, because there was extreme iniquity in the
   Jews, so that it was needful to distress and wholly to break them down,
   as moderate corrections had availed nothing. God, then, after having
   testified that he would be the leader in that war, now explains the
   reasons why he would chastise the Jews, and shews that his conduct
   towards them could not be ascribed to cruelty, inasmuch as that they
   had provoked him by their impious superstitions.

   Hence he says, I will speak my judgments with them This is referred by
   many interpreters to the Chaldeans and Assyrians, as though God would
   prescribe to them what was to be decreed, as chief judges are wont to
   do to those who are under them: but this exposition is strained, and
   confuted by what follows, on account of their wickedness What, then, is
   to speak judgments? It is done, when God summons the wicked before his
   tribunal, and executes the office of a judge. And this mode of speaking
   is common in Scripture, according to what we read at the end of this
   book, -- The king of Babylon spoke judgments with the King Zedekiah,
   (Jeremiah 52:9) that is, he dealt judicially with him, as we commonly
   say. [20] So now God declares that he would be the judge of the people,
   as though he had said, that hitherto he had been silent, not that the
   sins of the people were not known, but because he had borne with them,
   in order to try whether there was any hope of repentance. But he says
   now that he would become their judge, as he had found by long
   experience that they were past remedy.

   There is, then, to be understood a contrast between the forbearance of
   God, which he had long exercised while he dealt with the people, not as
   he might have justly done, but deferred his vengeance, and the time of
   vengeance which was now at hand; I will then speak my judgments with
   the Jews; that is, "I will now ascend my tribunal: I have hitherto
   abstained from exercising my right, and waited for them to return to
   me; but as there is no return, and I see that they are men wholly
   irreclaimable, and their disposition is so depraved that they
   continually add evils to evils, I will now begin to undertake mine
   office, the office of a judge." But we must bear in mind, as I have
   already said, the design of God in this declaration; for it was his
   object to clear himself from every charge, and from all calumnies,
   inasmuch as even the worst of men usually clamor against his judgments
   when he chastises them. Hence he presented before them his own
   judgments, as though he had said, "They shall not be able to blame me
   for dealing with them in a severe and cruel manner; for however severe
   I may be, I shall yet be an equitable judge." Hence he adds, on account
   of all their wickedness

   He afterwards shews what kind of wickedness it was, They have forsaken
   me, and burnt incense to strange gods The Jews had, indeed, in various
   ways, provoked his vengeance; but he mentions here one kind of
   wickedness, because it was the very fountain of evils, -- they had
   departed from the law and the pure worship of God; and yet he mentions
   generally all wickedness The word all is not here without meaning, "on
   account of all their wickedness:" for he intimates that they were not
   only in one way wicked, but that they had heaped together various sins.
   And then he adds, for they have forsaken me Here God introduces their
   defection; for it may be, as we daily see, that one offends in this
   thing, and another in that, and each one for different causes may
   expose himself to God's judgment; but God shews here that the Jews were
   become so depraved, that there was nothing sound or pure in them: hence
   he charges them with all wickedness; and then he mentions their
   defection, they have forsaken me; as though he had said, "They have
   wholly denied me; I say not that one is a thief, another an adulterer,
   and another a drunkard; but they are all become apostates, they are all
   perjurers and violators of the covenant: thus I am wholly forsaken by
   them, and they are in every respect alienated from me." We hence see
   how greatly the Prophet enhances the guilt of his own nation.

   It is afterwards added, for the sake of illustration, that they burnt
   incense to strange gods They had fallen away from God, and joined
   themselves to idolatry. He also adds this, -- that they bowed down
   before the works of their own hands The Prophet divests the Jews of
   every excuse, and more fully discovers their shame and baseness, --
   "they prostrated themselves before the works of their own hands."
   Whenever Scripture uses these expressions, it intimates that there is
   extreme madness in those men, who worship in the place of God not only
   the sun and moon, and other created things, but also the idols which
   they form for themselves. For how is it that they worship their own
   idols, except that they have formed for them a nose, and hands, and
   ears? A log of wood no one worships; a piece of brass or of silver all
   disregard; no one thinks a stone to be God: but when a thing is
   sculptured and artificially formed by the hand of man, miserable and
   blind idolaters immediately prostrate themselves; -- how is this?
   Because they have formed for their statues and pictures noses, eyes,
   and ears! hence they themselves have made gods. We now see the meaning
   of the Prophet, when he says, that the Jews bowed down before the works
   of their own hands But I pass over such things as these lightly, as ye
   must be well informed on the subject generally. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [20] The idea conveyed by the Septuagint is somewhat different, and I
   believe that it is what the original words mean, "laleso pros autous
   meta kriseos -- I will speak to them with judgment." The original
   literally is, "and I will speak my judgments to them;" that is, I will
   not speak words but judgments: or, I will not address them with words,
   but with actual judgments. Then in the following words the reason is
   assigned. The verse may be thus rendered, -- 16. And I will speak by my
   judgments to them, On account of all their wickedness, Because they
   have forsaken me, And have burnt incense to strange gods, And have
   bowed down to the work of their own hands. It is better to retain the
   outward act as expressed by the last verb, "bowed down." or, more
   literally, "bowed down themselves," as the verb is in the reflective
   mood, than to adopt the abstract term "worshipped." So the verb is
   rendered in the second commandment, Exodus 20:5; Deuteronomy 5:9. The
   first, line is rendered by Grotius, "Proedicam illis decreta mea -- I
   will declare to them my decrees, "that is, by Jeremiah and others, --
   by Jun. and Trem., "I will speak my judgments against them," that is,
   by the prophets, -- by Henry. "I will pass sentence upon them," -- by
   Blayney, "I will pronounce my judgments against them;" and Scott gives
   the same view. But Gataker says, "It seems rather to import an
   efficacious and actual decree that God would, in his own appointed
   time, pass upon them, and put in execution by the Chaldeans." Hence he
   renders the phrase like Henry, "I will pass sentence," or, "give
   judgment, upon them." -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 1:17

   17. Thou therefore gird up thy loins, and arise, and speak unto them
   all that I command thee: be not dismayed at their faces, lest I
   confound thee before them.

   17. Et tu accinge lumbos tuos et surge, et loquere ad ipsos quaecunque
   (vel, omnia quae) ego mandavero tibi; ne timeas a facie ipsorum, ne to
   conteram (vel, timere faciam) a facie ipsorum (est enim verbum sumptum
   ex eadem radice.)


   God first bids his Prophet to be the herald of the dreadful judgment,
   which we have already noticed: for it was not his purpose to speak only
   as it were in a corner, or secretly, to Jeremiah, but he committed to
   him what he intended should be proclaimed audibly to the whole people.
   It hence follows, And thou, etc. We therefore see that the Prophet had
   been taught by the Lord, that he might confidently and boldly declare
   what we shall hereafter see. These things should then be connected, --
   that God would ascend his tribunal to execute the vengeance he had
   deferred, -- and also that Jeremiah would be the herald of that
   vengeance he was prepared to inflict. Thou then, -- an illative is to
   be added here, for the copulative is to be thus taken in this place, --
   Thou then; that is, as thou hast heard that I shall be now the avenger
   of the people's sins, and that the time of vengeance is at hand; and
   also as thou knowest that this has been told thee, that thou mightest
   warn them to render them more inexcusable, -- Thou then, [21] gird thy
   loins We see why God addressed his servant Jeremiah privately; it was,
   that he might publicly exercise his office as a teacher.

   And hence we learn, that all who are called to rule the Church of God
   cannot be exempt from blame, unless they honestly and boldly proclaim
   what has been committed to them. Hence Paul says that he was free from
   the blood of all men, because he had from house to house and publicly
   declared whatever he had received from the Lord, (Acts 20:26, 27;) and
   he says in another place,

   "Woe is to me if I preach not the Gospel,
   for it has been committed to me." (1 Corinthians 9:16)

   God bids the Prophet to gird his loins This is to be understood of the
   kind of dress which the Orientals used and continue to use, for they
   wear long garments; and when they undertake any work, or when they
   proceed on a journey, they gird themselves. Hence he says, gird thy
   loins, that is, undertake this expetition which I devolve on thee. At
   the same time he requires activity, so that the work might be
   expeditiously undertaken. Arise, he says, and speak to them whatsoever
   I shall command thee In short, God intimates in these words, that he
   was unwilling to proceed to extremes, until he had still tried whether
   there was any hope of repentance as to the people. He indeed knew that
   they were wholly irreclaimable; but he intended to discover more fully
   their perverseness in bidding Jeremiah, in the last place, to pronounce
   the extreme sentence of condemnation.

   He now again repeats what he had before said, Fear not their face And
   this exhortation was very needful, as Jeremiah undertook an office in
   no small degree disliked; for it was the same as though he was an
   herald, to proclaim war in the name of God. As, then, Jeremiah had
   distinctly to declare that it was all over with the people, because
   their perverseness had been so great that God would no longer be
   entreated, it was a very hard message, not likely to be attended to,
   especially when we consider what great pride the Jews had. They gloried
   in their holy descent, and also thought, as we shall hereafter see,
   that the Temple was an impregnable fortress even against God himself.
   Since, then, their temper was so refractory, it was needful that the
   Prophet should be more than once confirmed by God, so that he might
   boldly undertake his office. The exhortation is, therefore, repeated,
   Fear not before them.

   He afterwards adds, lest I make thee to fear But the word cht, chet,
   means sometimes to fear, and sometimes to break in pieces. Jerome
   perverts the meaning of the Prophet, by rendering the phrase, "I shall
   never make thee to fear." It is indeed a godly truth, that God would
   give courage to his Prophet so as to render him invincible against his
   enemies; and doubtless he would exhort us in vain, were he not to
   supply us with fortitude by his Spirit. This is, indeed, true; but the
   word phn, pen, will not allow us thus to explain the passage. What then
   does God mean? We must either render the verb to break or to fear. The
   verb 'chtk achetak, is transitive; and either meaning would be
   suitable. For God, after having bidden the Prophet to be of a
   courageous and invincible mind, now adds,

   "Take heed to thyself; for if thou be timid, I will cause thee really
   to fear, or, I will break thee down before them."

   He then intimates, in these words, that the Prophet ought to be
   sufficiently fortified, as he knew that he was sent by God, and thus
   acted as it were under the authority of the highest power, and that he
   should not fear any mortal man. [22] There is also to be understood
   here a threatening, "See, if thou conductest thyself courageously I
   shall be present with thee, and however formidable at the first view
   thy opponents may be, they shall not yet prevail; but if thou be timid
   and faint -- hearted, [23] I will render thee an object of contempt:
   thou shalt not only be timid in heart; but I will make thee to be
   despised by all, so that thou shalt be contemptuously treated; for in
   that case thou wilt not be worthy that I should fight for thee and
   supply thee with any courage and power to put thine enemies to flight."

   We hence see what this means, Fear not, lest I should make thee to
   fear; that is, "Be of a good courage and of a ready mind, lest thou be
   justly exposed to shame; and fear them not, lest thou shouldest really
   fear them, and lest they should even tear thee to pieces and tread thee
   under their feet: for in case thou fearest them, thou wilt be unworthy
   of being supported by the strength of my Spirit."

   This passage contains a useful doctrine, from which we learn that
   strength shall never be wanting to God's servants, while they derive
   courage from the conviction that God himself is the author of their
   calling and become thus magnanimous; for God will then supply them with
   strength and courage invincible, so as to render them formidable to the
   whole world: but if they be unhinged and timid, and turn here and
   there, and be influenced by the fear of men, God will render them base
   and contemptible, and make them to tremble at the least breath of air,
   and they shall be wholly broken down; -- and why? because they are
   unworthy that God should help them, that he should stretch forth his
   hand and fortify them by his power, and supply them, as it has been
   already said, with that fortitude, by which they might terrify both the
   Devil and the whole world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [21] This is correctly given, only the v need not be rendered "then" or
   "therefore." It is an instance of the nominative absolute, or of the
   anticipative case, - And thou, gird thy loins,
   And arise, and speak to them
   All that I shall command thee. "And as for thee," by Blayney, is very
   tame and prosaic. The version of the Geneva Bible is, "Thou, therefore,
   trusse up thy loyns." -- Ed.

   [22] It is true that the primary meaning of the verb here used is, to
   be broken, or to be broken down, to be broken in pieces. It is applied
   to the breaking of a bow, and to the breaking down of images, 1 Samuel
   2:4; Jeremiah 50:2; and to the breaking down of nations, (Isaiah 8:3;
   Isaiah 30:31.) Such is its meaning when applied to what is material and
   visible; but when applied to the mind or spirit, it means to be
   dispirited, daunted, terrified, or dismayed, 2 Kings 19:26; Jeremiah
   8:9. It is here first in a passive sense, and then in Hiphil, as in Job
   31:34; and in Jeremiah 49:37, -- Be not dismayed at them,
   Lest I cause thee to be dismayed before them. or, Be not terrified by
   them,
   Lest I terrify thee before them. Blayney gives to the verb first its
   secondary meaning, and then its primary, "Be not thou afraid of them,
   lest I should suffer thee to be crushed before them." How crushed
   before them? By whom? And to say that there is no threat included in
   the last line is singular, as words could hardly be framed to express
   it more distinctly. The Targum expresses the meaning of the first line,
   "Restrain not thyself from rebuking them." Grotius renders the last
   line, "Ne ego to perterrefaciam coram illis -- lest I terrify thee
   before them;" which seems to be its best rendering. -- Ed.

   [23] Cotton, the old translator, has rendered it very strikingly, "If
   thou quailest," expressing the two words in one. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast been once pleased to fortify thy
   servant Jeremiah with the invincible power of thy Spirit, -- O grant
   that his doctrine may at this day make us humble, and that we may learn
   willingly to submit to thee, and so to receive and even cordially to
   accept what thou offerest to us by thy servant -- to sustain us by
   thine hand, and that we, relying on thy power and protection, may fight
   against the world and against Satan, while each of us, in his vocation,
   so recumbs on thy power, as not to hesitate, whenever necessary, to
   expose our very life to dangers: and may we manfully fight and
   persevere in our warfare to the end, until having finished our course
   we shall at length come to that blessed rest which is reserved for us
   in heaven, through Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 1:18

   18. For, behold, I have made thee this day a defenced city, and an iron
   pillar, and brasen walls against the whole land, against the kings of
   Judah, against the princes thereof, against the priests thereof, and
   against the people of the land.

   18. Et ego, [24] ecce posui to hodie in urbem munitionis (vel, munitam)
   in columnam (vel, fulturam) ferream, et in murum aeneum, super totam
   terram, contra Reges Jehudah, contra principes ejus, contra sacerdotes
   ejus, contra populum terrae ipsius.


   God supplies here his servant with confidence; for courage was
   necessary in that state of trembling which we have observed. Jeremiah
   thought himself unfit to undertake a work so onerous; he had also to do
   and to contend with refractory men, and not a few in number; for the
   whole people had already, through their ungodly and wicked obstinacy,
   hardened themselves in the contempt of God. As, then, there was no more
   any care for religion, and no regard manifested by the people for
   heavenly truth, Jeremiah could not, diffident as he was, undertake so
   heavy a burden, without being supported by the hand of God. For this
   reason, then, God now declares that he would make him like a fortified
   city and an iron pillar [25] Indeed, the word prop would be more
   proper; for mvr omud, comes from the root md, omed; and the Prophet
   understands by it, not a pillar that is raised and stands by itself,
   but that which sustains a building or a wall. There is no ambiguity in
   the meaning; for God means that his servant would be invincible, and
   that whatever his enemies might devise against him, they would not yet
   prevail, as we find it said in the next verse.

   Now, though this was said formerly to Jeremiah, yet godly teachers may
   justly apply it to themselves, who are honestly conscious of their
   Divine call, and are fully persuaded that they do nothing
   presumptuously, but obey the bidding of God. All, then, who are thus
   confirmed in their legitimate call from God, can apply to themselves
   this promise -- that they shall be made invincible against all the
   ungodly.

   But the particulars of this passage deserve to be noticed. It might
   have seemed enough that God called his servant a fortified city; but he
   compares him also to an iron pillar or column, and to a brazen wall
   This repetition only confirms what we have explained, -- that Jeremiah
   would be victorious, and that though Satan might rouse many to assail
   him, yet the issue would be prosperous and joyful, as he would fight
   under the protection of God.

   It is at the same time added, Over the whole land God doubtless speaks
   not of the whole world, but of the land of Judah; for Jeremiah was
   chosen for this purpose, -- that he might bestow his labor on the
   chosen people. It is then said that he would be a conqueror of the
   whole of Judea. It then follows, against the kings of Judah We know,
   indeed, that there was only one king in Judea; but God encourages his
   Prophet to be firm and persevering, as though he had said, that the
   course of his warfare would be long; and he said this, that he might
   not faint through weariness. The meaning then is, that the Prophet
   would not have to contend with one king only, but that as soon as one
   died, another would rise and oppose him; so that he was to know that
   there would be no hope of rest until that time had passed which God
   himself had appointed. We indeed know that those who are sincerely
   disposed to obey, do yet look for some definite period, when, like
   soldiers who have served their time, they may obtain a discharge; but
   God declares here to his Prophet, that when he had strenuously
   contended to the death of one king, his condition would be nothing
   better; for others would succeed, with whom he would have to fight, as
   the same wickedness and obstinacy would be still continued. To kings,
   he adds princes and priests; and, lastly, the whole people

   When a king forgets his office and rules tyrannically, it often happens
   that there are moderators who check his passions, when they cannot
   wholly restrain them: we indeed see, that the most cruel tyrants are
   sometimes softened by good counselors. But God here reminds his Prophet
   that the state of things in Judea would be so desperate, that ungodly
   and wicked kings would have counselors endued with the same
   disposition. When priests are added, it might seem still more
   monstrous; but the Scripture everywhere testifies, that the Levitical
   priests had almost all degenerated and become apostates, so that hardly
   one in a hundred shewed the least sign of religion. Since, then, that
   order had become thus corrupt, it is no wonder that Jeremiah had to
   declare war against the priests; and we shall hereafter see that this
   was done. Now the common people might have seemed to be excusable, as
   there was greater simplicity among them than among the higher orders;
   (for they who are elevated above others transgress through pride or
   cruelty, and often allow themselves too much liberty, relying on their
   own eminence; but the common people, as I have said, seemed apparently
   to have more modesty;) but God here declares that impiety had so
   greatly prevailed in Judea, that all, from the least to the greatest,
   were become perversely wicked. It was, therefore, necessary, as I have
   before stated, that the Prophet should be fully armed; for what could
   he have thought, had he not in time been warned, on finding afterwards
   such insolence, yea, such fury in high and low, as to constrain him to
   contend with God's chosen people no otherwise than with devils? It
   afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [24] We find here nearly the same form or mode of speech as at the
   beginning of the previous verse, "And I, behold I have made thee,"
   etc.: and Blayney renders it so here, though not in the preceding
   instance. -- Ed.

   [25] There is the preposition l before "city," "pillar," and "wall." It
   is an idiom. The full meaning is, "I have made thee to be for a
   fortified city." The same idiom exists in Welsh, the preposition yn is
   used, which implies that the verb to be is understood. But it is not
   necessary to retain the preposition in a language in which a similar
   idiom does not exist. The Septuagint render the preposition by "hos --
   as," and Jun and Trem , by "velut -- as," or like. And such a word
   would be suitable in our language, -- And I, behold I have made thee
   this day
   Like a city that is fortified,
   And like a pillar of iron,
   And like a wall of brass,
   With regard to the whole land,
   To the kings of Judah, to its princes,
   To its priests, and to the people of the land. "To" here means in
   opposition to-he was to stand opposed to the kings, etc., as a
   fortified city, etc. "Wall" is plural in the received text; but many
   MSS., the Septuagint, the Syriac, the Targum, and the Vulgate, have it
   in the singular number, which seems most suitable. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 1:19

   19. And they shall fight against thee; but they shall not prevail
   against thee; for I am with thee, saith the LORD, to deliver thee.

   19. Pugnabunt autem tecum (vel, praeliabuntur contra to,) sed non
   praevalebunt tibi, quia tecum ego (quia sum tecum,) dicit Jehova, ad to
   liberandum.


   God in this verse briefly reminds his servant, that though he would be
   supplied with invincible power, yet he would have great trials, so that
   his office would not be, according to a common saying, a mere play. He
   then shews for what purpose he would be made like a fortified city, an
   iron pillar, and a brazen wall, even that he might manfully fight, and
   not for the purpose of keeping away all dangers, and all fightings, and
   everything hard and grievous to the flesh. We, in short, see that the
   promise was given for this end, -- that Jeremiah, relying on God's aid,
   might not hesitate to set himself against all the Jews, and that
   whatever might be their fury, he might still be courageous.

   Now a profitable doctrine may be hence gathered, even this -- that
   whenever God promises his servants victory over their enemies, they
   ought not to make this the occasion of fostering their torpidity or
   idleness, but, on the contrary, of gathering courage, so that they may
   proceed boldly and unweariedly in the course of their vocation. In
   short, God promises to be their deliverer, but at the same time exhorts
   them to resist all the assaults of their enemies.

   Hence he says, They shall fight with thee, but they shall not prevail,
   for I am with thee to deliver thee [26] From these words we see that
   Jeremiah was fully armed, that he might not fear on seeing dangers
   surrounding him; for God does not here declare that he would be like a
   wall to him to prevent him from being assaulted, but he says that he
   would deliver him; as though he had said, "Prepare thyself to suffer;
   for except I were thy deliverer, it would be all over with thee, and
   thou mightest perish a hundred times; but there is no reason for thee
   to fear any dangers amidst thousand deaths, since I am present with
   thee as thy deliverer." Now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [26] It ought to be, "For with thee will I be, to deliver thee;" for
   the verb to be, being understood, it must be put in the same tense with
   the other verbs in the passage: and such is the rendering of Blayney.

   CHAPTER 2
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 2:1-2

   1. Moreover, the word of the LORD came to me, saying,

   1. Et fuit sermo Jehovae ad me, dicendo,

   2. Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith the LORD; I
   remember thee, the kindness of thy youth, the love of thine espousals,
   when thou wentest after me in the wilderness, in a land that was not
   sown.

   2. Vade et clama ad aures Jerusalem, dicendo, Sic dicit Jehova,
   Recordatus sum tui propter misericordiam adolescentiae tuae et
   dilectionem desponsationis tuae, quum me sequuta es (quum venisti post
   me, profecta es post me) in deserto, in terra non seminata.


   God now mentions to his servant the commands which he was to convey to
   the king and priests, and to the whole people; for by the ears of
   Jerusalem he means all its inhabitants. God here intimates that the
   Jews were unworthy of being cared for by him any more; but that he is
   induced by another reason not to reject them wholly, until he had found
   out by experience their irreclaimable wickedness. So then he makes this
   preface, I remember thee for the kindness of thy youth, and the love of
   thy espousals In these words he shews that he regarded not what the
   Jews deserved, nor acknowledged any worthiness in them, as the reason
   why he was solicitous for their salvation, and endeavored to bring them
   to the right way by the labors of his Prophet, but that this is to be
   ascribed to his former benefits.

   Some render the words, "I remember the piety or kindness of thy youth;"
   and lk lak, may be thus taken, as it is in other places. Others omit
   this word; while others consider a copulative to be understood, "I
   remember thee, and the kindness of thy youth." But none, as I think,
   have attained to the meaning of the Prophet: there is yet no obscurity
   in the words, if a preposition be considered as being understood, so as
   to read thus, -- that God remembered his people for the kindness which
   he had shewn to them, and for the love which he had manifested towards
   them from the beginning. Then the real meaning of the Prophet I think
   to be this, -- that God here takes away every ground for pride and
   boasting from the Jews; as though he had said, that they were worthy,
   they had no reason to think; but that he was still their Father, and
   was therefore unwilling that the benefits he had formerly conferred
   upon them should be wholly lost. There is, in short, given here a
   reason why God sent Jeremiah after the other prophets; as though he had
   said, "It is a testimony to you of the paternal care which I shew to
   you, when I send my Prophet to give you a hope of pardon, if ye return
   to the right way and be reconciled to me. But how is it that I still
   shew a concern for you, as ye have forgotten me, and wholly disregarded
   my law? It is so, because I wish to continue my favors to you." The
   kindness of thy youth he takes in a passive sense; for he does not mean
   that the Jews were kind or merciful, but that they had experienced the
   kindness of God.

   But the metaphor here used must be noticed. God compares himself here
   to a young bridegroom, who marries a youthful bride, in the flower of
   her age, and in the prime of her beauty: and it is a manner of speaking
   commonly adopted by the prophets. I will not now detain you with a long
   explanation, as the subject will be treated more at large in another
   place.

   As God, then, had espoused the people of Israel, when he redeemed and
   brought them out of Egypt, he says now, that he remembers the people on
   account of that kindness and love. He sets kindness or beneficence
   before love. The word chsr, chesad, properly means a gratuitous favor
   or kindness, which is shewn to the miserable, or beneficence. By the
   word love, God means in many other places the gratuitous election with
   which he had favored the whole people. The expression is indeed made
   clearer when kindness or gratuitous favor is placed first, and then
   love is added: though nothing new is added, yet the Prophet more fully
   shews that the people had been loved by God in no other way than
   through his kindness. [27]

   Now this is a remarkable passage; for God shews that his covenant,
   though perfidiously violated by the Jews, was yet firm and immutable:
   for though not all who derive their descent according to the flesh from
   Abraham, are true and legitimate Israelites, yet God ever remains true,
   and his calling, as Paul says, is without repentance. (Romans 11:29.)
   We may therefore learn this from the Prophet's words, -- that God was
   not content with one Prophet, but continued his favor, inasmuch as he
   would not render void his covenant. The Jews indeed had impiously
   departed from the covenant, and a vast number had deservedly perished,
   having been wholly repudiated; yet God designed really to shew that his
   grace depends not on the inconstancy of men, as Paul says in another
   place, for it would then presently fail, (Romans 3:4) and that were all
   men false and perfidious, God would yet remain true and fixed in his
   purpose. This we learn from the Prophet's words, when it is said, that
   God remembered the people on account of the kindness of their youth.

   As to youth and espousals, we may hence learn that they had been
   anticipated by God's kindness; for they became in no other way
   connected with God than by having been chosen by him: their espousal
   would not have been enjoyed by the people, had not God anticipated
   them. What was Abraham? and what were all his posterity? God then now
   shews, that the beginning of all blessings, and as it were the
   fountain, was this, -- that it pleased him to choose the people for
   himself.

   And the same thing is confirmed in other words: When, he says, thou
   didst follow me in the desert, in a land not sown The people, we know,
   did not obey God as they ought to have done, even when he had redeemed
   them. Hence God does not so much in this place commend the people for
   any merits of their own, but especially confirms what I have already
   stated, -- that he could not cast aside every care for a people whom he
   had once adopted, and whom he had led through the desert, that they
   might be a people separated from the rest of the world. He however
   concedes to them, according to his great goodness, the praise of
   obedience, because they followed God through rough ways, as though a
   tender young woman refused not to undergo hard and irksome toils from
   love to her bridegroom. He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [27] Though most of modern commentators, Grotius, Gataker, Blayney,
   Scott, Adam Clarke, etc., give the same view of this verse with Calvin,
   yet the probability is, and something more than the probability, that
   the sense in which it was taken by the ancients is the correct one;
   which is the sense given in our version, and adopted by Henry. A
   literal rendering of the verse is sufficient to shew its meaning, -- 2.
   Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, saying, Thus saith Jehovah, -- I
   remember, with regard to thee, The kindness of thy youth, The love of
   thy espousals, Thy coming after me in the desert, Through a land not
   sown. "Thy coming, or, walking after me," stands in the same relation
   to "remember" as the two preceding words: this is plainly the
   construction; and this construction determines the meaning of the
   foregoing lines. Our version is quite wrong in rendering lk, "thee;" it
   ought ever to be rendered as above, when the verb, as here, is followed
   by an accusative case. See Leviticus 26:45; Psalm 79:8; Psalm 106:45
   What has led commentators, no doubt, to divert this passage from its
   right meaning was their impression that more is here ascribed to Israel
   than their history warrants. But this is not the only instance in which
   their former conduct is contrasted with their latter conduct. This is
   done in Malachi 2:5, as to the priests. The object here is to set forth
   the difference between the people when brought out of Egypt, and
   following God's guidance in the wilderness, and their conduct at the
   time of Jeremiah. They were indeed very far from being what they ought
   to have been in the first instance, but their deportment in Jeremiah's
   age was incomparably worse. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:3

   3. Israel was holiness unto the LORD, and the firstfruits of his
   increase: all that devour him shall offend; evil shall come upon them,
   saith the LORD.

   3. Sanctitas Israel Jehovae, primitiae frugum ejus; quicunque
   comederint contrahent noxam (alii vertunt, peccabunt; sed ego potius ad
   poenam refero,) malun veniet super eos (exegetice additur hoc membrum)
   dicit Jehova.


   God here more clearly reprobates the ingratitude of the people: and
   first he enumerates his favors by which he had bound the people for
   ever to himself; and secondly, he shews how malignantly the people
   responded to the many blessings which they had received.

   In saying, then, that Israel was holy, he intends it not by way of
   honor. It was indeed in itself an illustrious testimony to their
   praise, that God had consecrated that people to himself, that he
   designed them to be the first -- fruits of his increase: but we must
   remember that there is here an implied contrast between this great and
   incomparable favor of God, and the wickedness of the people, who
   afterwards fell away from that God who had been so liberal and gracious
   to them. According to this view, then, does Jeremiah say, that Israel
   was holiness to God; that is, that they were separated from all other
   nations, so that the glory of God shone only among them.

   He then adds, that they were the first-fruits of his produce For though
   whatever produce the earth may bring forth ought to be consecrated to
   God, by whose power it grows, yet we know that the first -- fruits were
   gathered and set on the altar as a sacred food. As, then, God had
   commanded, under the law, the first-fruits to be offered to him, and
   then given to the priests, he says here, in accordance with that rite,
   that Israel were the first -- fruits of his produce. For the nations,
   who then everywhere dwelt, were not removed from under God's government
   (as he is the creator of all, and shews himself to all as the Father
   and supporter); but he passed by other nations, and chose the race of
   Abraham, and for this end, -- that he might protect them by his power
   and aid. Since, then, God had so bound the nation to himself, how great
   and how strong was the obligation under which that people was to him?
   Hence the more base and the more detestable was their perfidy, when the
   people despised the singular favors which God had conferred on them. We
   now see why the Prophet says that Israel was holy to God, and the first
   -- fruits of his increase.

   He also intimates that the time would come, when God would gather to
   himself other nations; for in the first-fruits the people dedicated and
   offered to God the whole produce of the year is included. So then
   Israel was like the first-fruits, because God afterwards took to
   himself other nations, which for many ages were deemed profane. But yet
   his special object was to shew that the guilt of the people was
   extreme, as they did not acknowledge the great favors which God had
   bestowed on them.

   He then adds, Whosoever will devour him shall be punished Of this
   meaning I approve, because the explanation immediately follows, evil
   shall come on them God then means not that they should be only guilty
   of a crime, who should devour the first-fruits, but refers rather to
   punishment; as though he had said, "The profane shall not be unpunished
   who shall devour the first-fruits which has been dedicated to me." For
   if any had stolen the first- fruits, God would have executed a
   vengeance such as sacrilege deserved. If, however, any one prefers the
   other explanation, -- that it would be a crime to injure Israel, or to
   do him any harm, because he was under God's protection, I shall not
   oppose him: but the wording of the sentence leads me to the other view,
   that is, that those who would injure Israel would not only be guilty,
   but would not be able to escape God's vengeance, -- and why? because
   evil will come upon them, saith Jehovah [28] He afterwards explains
   more clearly the import of his doctrine --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [28] Blayney considers this verse as referring to Israel in ancient
   times, and as spoken by God: hence he renders the last words, "said
   Jehovah." The first part seems to declare what Israel was, and the
   other appears to be the language of God respecting them, -- Holy was
   Israel to Jehovah,
   The first-fruits of his produce:
   "All his devourers shall be deemed guilty,
   Evil shall come to them," said Jehovah. The verb 'sm is rendered
   "plemmelesousi -- shall offend," by the Septuagint, as in our version,
   and by Grotius; "trespass," by Gataker; and, "guilty of a trespass," by
   Blayney. The contradiction of guilt is what is meant, as the punishment
   is announced in the next words. See Psalm 105:14, 15. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 2:4-5

   4. Hear ye the word of the LORD, O house of Jacob, and all the families
   of the house of Israel:

   4. Audite sermonem Jehovae domus Jacob, et omnes cognationes (vel,
   familiae) domus Israel:

   5. Thus saith the LORD, What iniquity have your fathers found in me,
   that they are gone far from me, and have walked after vanity, and are
   become vain?

   5. Sic dicit Jehova, Quid invenerunt patres vestri in me iniquitatis,
   quia alienati sunt a me, et ambulaverunt (vel, profecti sunt) post
   vanitatem, et facti sunt evanidi (vel, evanuerunt)?


   Here God explains why he had referred to what we have noticed, -- that
   he had consecrated Israel to himself as a peculiar people, and as the
   first -- fruits. God often mentions his favors to us, in order to
   encourage our hope, that we may be fully persuaded that whatever may
   happen we are ever safe, because we are under his protection, since he
   has chosen us. But in this place, and in many other places, God
   recounts the obligations under which the Israelites were to him, that
   thence their ingratitude might become more apparent.

   Hence he says, Hear ye the word of Jehovah By this preface he seeks to
   gain attention; for he intimates that he was going to address them on
   no common subject. Hear ye, then, O house of Jacob; hear all ye
   families of the house of Israel; as though Jeremiah had said, "Here I
   come forth boldly in the name of God, for I fear not that any defense
   can be brought forward by you to disprove the justice of God's reproof;
   and I confidently wait for what ye may say, for I know you will be
   silent. I then loudly cry like a trumpet and with a clear voice, that I
   am come to condemn you; if there is anything which ye can answer, I
   give you full liberty to do so; but the truth will constrain you to be
   mute, for your guilt is extremely odious and capable of the fullest
   proof." Hence it was that he exhorted them to hear attentively.

   Then follows the charge: What, iniquity have your fathers found in me,
   that having forsaken me they should walk after vanity and become vain?
   Here Jeremiah charges the people with two crimes, -- that they had
   departed from the true God, whom they had found to be a deliverer, --
   and that they had become vain in their devices; or, in other words,
   that they were become for no reason apostates: for their sin was
   enhanced, because there had been no occasion given them to forsake God,
   and to alienate themselves from him. As then God had kindly treated
   them, and they themselves had shaken off the yoke, and as there was no
   one whom they could compare with God, they could not have said, "We
   have been deceived," -- how so? "For ye have, he says, followed vanity;
   and vanity alone was the reason why ye have departed from me." [29] I
   wish I could proceed farther; but I have some business to which I was
   called even before the lecture.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [29] The literal rendering of this verse is as follows, -- 5. Thus
   saith Jehovah, What have your fathers found in me? Oppression? For they
   have gone far from me, And have followed after vanity, And have become
   vain. The word svl, oppression, injustice, or tyranny, is so placed in
   the sentence that it cannot be construed with "what." The word "vanity"
   means often an idol, and it is so considered here by the Targum, by
   Piscator, Grotius, Gataker, and others. It is often found in the
   plural, "vanities," as it is here in the Septuagint; see Deuteronomy
   32:21; 1 Kings 16:26; Psalm 31:6: but it is here the poetical singular.
   They "became vain," that is, foolish, sottish, having no more sense or
   reason than their idols, as idolaters are represented in Psalm 115:8.
   Their senselessness is set forth in the next verse. An idol is
   especially called "vanity," because it can do no good and avails
   nothing: deluded imagination alone gives it all its efficacy and power.
   Samuel gives a true account of idols, 1 Samuel 12:21. But as long as
   the devil deceives and deludes the world, idols and images will be in
   repute, though they are in themselves wholly useless and worthless,
   while yet they prove ruinous to the souls of men. -- Ed

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou continuest at this day, both morning
   and evening, to invite us to thyself, and assiduously exhortest us to
   repent, and testifiest that thou art ready to be reconciled to us,
   provided we flee to thy mercy, -- O grant, that we may not close our
   ears and reject this thy great kindness, but that remembering thy
   gratuitous election, the chief of all the favors thou hast been pleased
   to shew us, we may strive so to devote ourselves to thee, that thy name
   may be glorified through our whole life: and should it be that we at
   any time turn aside from thee, may we quickly return to the right way,
   and become submissive to thy holy admonitions, that it may thus appear
   that we have been so chosen by thee and called as to desire to continue
   in the hope of that salvation, to which thou invitest us, and which is
   prepared for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture Fifth

   WE heard yesterday God's complaint, and his expostulation with his
   people. He said in short, that if they came before any judge there were
   reasons sufficient to condemn their ingratitude, and that they were
   without excuse, because they had gone after vanity and were become
   vain; or, in other words, that they had without a cause forsaken him,
   and were carried away only by their own intentions. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 2:6-7

   6. Neither said they, Where is the LORD that brought us up out of the
   land of Egypt, that led us through the wilderness, through a land of
   deserts and of pits, through a land of drought, and of the shadow of
   death, through a land that no man passed through, and where no man
   dwelt?

   6. Et non dixerunt, (hoc est, non cogitarunt apud se,) Ubi est Jehova,
   qui eduxit nos e terra Egypti, et proficisci fecit nos per desertum in
   terra solitaria (vel, vasta) et squalida, in terra horribili et umbrae
   mortis; in terra per quam vir non transtit, et in qua non habitavit
   homo?

   7. And I brought you into a plentiful country, to eat the fruit thereof
   and the goodness thereof; but when ye entered, ye defiled my land, and
   made mine heritage an abomination.

   7. Et introduxi vos in terram fertilem, ad comedendos fructus ejus
   (vel, ad comedendum fructum ejus, in singulari,) et ubertatem ejus (ad
   verbum est, ad bonum ejus;) et ingressi estis et polluistis terram
   meam, et haereditatem meam posuistis in abominationem.


   The Prophet goes on with the same subject; for God adduces here no
   small crime against his people, as they had buried his favom's in
   oblivion. Indeed, a redemption so wonderful was worthy of being
   celebrated in all ages, not only by one nation, but by all the nations
   of the earth. As then the Jews had thus buried the memory of a favor so
   remarkable and valuable, their base impiety appeared evident. Had they
   not experienced the power and kindness of God, or had they only
   witnessed them in an ordinary way, their guilt might have been
   extenuated; but as God had from heaven made an unusual display of his
   power, and as his majesty had been manifested before the eyes of the
   people, how great was their sottishness in afterwards forgetting their
   God, who had openly and with such proofs made himself known to them!

   We now then understand what the Prophet means by saying, they have not
   said: for God here sharply reproves the stupidity of the Jews, -- that
   they did not consider that they were under perpetual obligations to him
   for his great kindness in delivering them in a manner so wonderful from
   the land of Egypt. By saying that they did not say, Where is Jehovah,
   he intimates that he was present with them and nigh them, but that they
   were blind, and that hence they were without an excuse for their
   ignorance, as he was not to be sought as one at a distance, or by means
   tedious and difficult. If then this only had come to their mind, "Did
   not God once redeem us?" they could not have departed after their
   vanities. How then was it that their error, or rather their madness,
   was so great that they followed idols? Even because they did not choose
   to make any effort, or to apply their minds to seek or to inquire after
   God.

   Here then the Prophet meets the objection of the hypocrites, who might
   have said, that they had been deceived, and had relapsed through
   ignorance; for they have ever some evasions ready at hand, when they
   are called to an account for their sins. But lest the Jews should make
   any pretense of this kind, the Prophet here shews that they had not
   been through a mistake deceived, but that they had followed after
   falsehood through a wicked disposition, for they had willfully despised
   God and refused to inquire respecting him, though he was sufficiently
   nigh them.

   This passage deserves to be especially noticed; for there is nothing
   more common than for the ungodly, when they are proved guilty, to have
   recourse to this subterfuge, -- that they acted with good intention,
   when they gave themselves up to their own superstitions. The Prophet
   then takes off this mask, and shews that where God is once known, his
   name and his glory cannot be obliterated, except through the depravity
   of men, as they knowingly and willfully depart from him. Hence all
   apostates are by this one clause condemned, that they may no more dare
   to make evasions, as though they have been through more simplicity
   deceived: for when the matter is examined, their malignity and
   ingratitude are discovered, because they deign not to inquire, Where is
   Jehovah?

   And he afterwards adds what explains this sentence. I have said that
   other nations are not here condemned, but the Jews, who had known by
   clear experience that God was their father. As then God had, by many
   testimonies, made himself known to them, they had no pretext for their
   ignorance. Hence the Prophet says, that they did not consider where God
   was who brought them from the land of Egypt, and made them to pass
   through the desert He could not have stated this indiscriminately of
   all nations; but, as it has been said, the words are addressed
   particularly to the Jews, who had clearly witnessed the power of God;
   so that they could not have sinned except willfully, even by
   extinguishing, through their own malignity, the light presented to
   them, which shone before their eyes. And here, also, the Prophet
   amplifies their guilt by various circumstances: for he says, not simply
   that they had been brought out of Egypt, but intimates that God had
   been their constant guide for forty years; for this time is suggested
   by the word "desert." The history was well known; hence a brief
   allusion was sufficient. He, at the same time, by mentioning the
   desert, greatly extols the glory of God.

   But the first thing to be observed is, that the Jews were inexcusable,
   who had not considered that their fathers had been wonderfully and in
   an unusual manner preserved by God's hand for forty years; for they had
   no bread to eat, nor water to drink. God drew water for them from a
   rock, and satisfied them with heavenly bread; and their garments did
   not wear out during the whole time. We then see that all those
   circumstances enhanced their guilt. Then follows what I have referred
   to: the Prophet calls the desert a dry or a waste land, a dreary land,
   a horrible land, a land of deadly gloom, as though he had said, that
   the people had been preserved in the midst of death, yea in the midst
   of many deaths: for man was not wont to pass through that land, nor did
   any one dwell in it [30] "Whence then," he says, "did salvation arise
   to you? from what condition? even from death itself: for what else was
   the desert but a horrible place, where you were surrounded, not only by
   one kind of death, but by a hundred? Since then God brought you out of
   Egypt by his incredible power, and fed you in a supernatural manner for
   forty years, what excuse can there be for so great a madness in now
   alienating yourselves from him?" Now this passage teaches us, that the
   more favors God confers on us, the more heinous the guilt if we forsake
   him, and less excusable will be our wickedness and ingratitude,
   especially when he has manifested his kindness to us for a long time
   and in various ways.

   He afterwards adds, And I brought you in, etc. Here Jeremiah introduces
   God as the speaker; for God had, as with his hand stretched forth,
   brought in the children of Abraham into the possession of the promised
   land, which they did not get, as it is said in Psalm 44:3, by their own
   power and by their own sword; for though they had to fight with many
   enemies, yet it was God that made them victorious. He could then truly
   say, that they did not otherwise enter the land than under his
   guidance; inasmuch as he had opened a way and passage for them, and
   subdued and put to flight their enemies, that they might possess the
   heritage promised to them. I brought you in, he says, into the land,
   into Carmel Some consider this to be the name of a place; and no doubt
   there was the mount Carmel, so called on account of its great
   fertility. As then its name was given to it because it was so fertile,
   it is nothing strange that Jeremiah compares the land of Israel to
   Carmel. Some will have the preposition k, caph, to be understood, "I
   have brought you into a land like Carmel." But there is no need
   laboriously to turn in all directions the Prophet's words. It is, as I
   think, a common noun, meaning fruitful, and used here to shew that the
   Israelites had been brought by God's hand into a fertile land; for its
   fertility is everywhere celebrated, both in the Law and in the
   Prophets. [31]

   That ye might eat its fruit and its abundance; that is, "I wished you
   to enjoy the large and rich produce of the land." By these words God
   intimates that the Israelites ought to have been induced by such
   allurements cordially to serve him; for by such liberal treatment he
   kindly invited them to himself. The greater, then, the bounty of God
   towards the people, the greater was the indignity offered by their
   defection, when they despised the various and abounding blessings of
   God.

   Hence he adds, And ye have polluted my land, [32] and mine heritage
   have ye made an abomination; as though he had said, "This is the reward
   by which my bounty towards you has been compensated. I indeed gave you
   this land, but on this condition, that ye serve me faithfully in it:
   but ye have polluted it." He calls it his own land, as though he had
   said, that he had so given the land to the Israelites, that he remained
   still the lord of it as a proprietor, though he granted the occupation
   of it to them. He hence shews that they impiously abused his bounty, in
   polluting that land which was sacred to his name. For the same purpose
   he calls it his heritage, as if he said that they possessed the land by
   an hereditary right, and yet the heritage belonged to their Father.
   They ought, therefore, to have considered, that they had entered into
   the land, because it had been given to Abraham and to his children for
   an heritage, -- by whom? By God, who was the fountain of this bounty.
   The more detestable, then, was their ingratitude, when they made the
   heritage of God an abomination It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [30] Though the general import of this verse is given, yet the version
   is not very accurate. I offer the following- And they have not said,
   "Where is Jehovah, Who brought us up from the land of Egypt, Who led us
   in the wilderness, Through a land of waste and of the pit, Through a
   land of drought and of the shadow of death, Through a land in which no
   man traveled, And no human being dwelt there?" The word "pit" is used
   poetically, the singular for the plural, and correctly rendered "pits"
   in our version. It is probably an allusion to the practice of digging
   pits and covering them over, in order to catch wild beasts; and the
   word is used here only to express hidden dangers. "The shadow of death"
   means a barren dreariness. After "land," in the last line but one, 'sr
   is supplied by three MSS., and by the Septuagint, though by no means in
   character with the Greek language; but the idiom of the Hebrew requires
   it, and is no doubt the true reading. I have rendered 'dm in the last
   line, after Blayney, "human being." The five last lines are thus given
   by the Septuagint, -- Who conducted you in the wilderness,
   In a land unknown and inaccessible (abato)
   In a land without water and barren (akarpo -- fruitless)
   In a land through which no man passed,
   And no son of man inhabited there. The word "barren" is rendered more
   literally by Theodotion, "skias thanatou -- of the shadow of death." --
   Ed

   [31] That the word means a fruitful field or country is evident from
   Isaiah 10:18; Isaiah 16:10; Jeremiah 4:26, etc. there was also a city
   bearing this name, situated in the tribe of Judah, Joshua 15:55, and
   also a mountain belonging to the tribe of Manasseh, Joshua 19:26. --
   Ed.

   [32] "And ye came" is left out. The same verb in a causative sense is
   used at the beginning of the verse, rendered, "I brought." It would be
   more striking to retain the same verb, and not to use "but when" in the
   latter instance, as in our version, -- And I caused you to come into a
   fruitful land, To eat its fruit and its rich produce; And ye came and
   polluted my land, And made mine heritage an abomination. The whole runs
   thus much better, and has the conciseness of poetry: and the idea
   intended to be conveyed is more apparent -- God caused them to come,
   and they came. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:8

   8. The priests said not, Where is the LORD? and they that handle the
   law knew me not: the pastors also transgressed against me, and the
   prophets prophesied by Baal, and walked after things that do not
   profit.

   8. Sacerdotes non dixerunt, Ubi Jehova? et qui tenebant (vel,
   servabant) legem (ad verbum est, apprehendentes, vel, tenentes legem)
   non cognoverunt me: et pastores perfide egerunt mecum; et prophetae
   prophetarunt in Baal (hoc est, per Baal,) et post ea qua non prosunt
   ambulaverunt (vel, profecti sunt).


   God assails here especially the teachers and those to whom was
   committed the power of ruling the people. It often happens that the
   common people fall away, while yet some integrity remains in the
   rulers. But God shews here that such was the falling away among the
   whole community, that priests as well as prophets and all the chief men
   had departed from the true worship of God, and from all uprightness.

   Now, when Jeremiah thus rebukes the teachers and the priests and
   others, he does not excuse the common people, nor extenuate the crimes,
   which then prevailed everywhere, as we shall see from what follows. As
   many think that they set up a shield against God, when they pretend
   that they are not acquainted with so much learning as to distinguish
   between light and darkness, but that they are guided by their rulers,
   the Prophet, therefore, does not here cast the faults of the people
   upon their rulers, but, on the contrary, he amplifies the atrocity of
   their impiety, for they had, from the least to the greatest, rejected
   God and his Law. We now, then, understand the design of the Prophet.
   [33]

   We may learn from this passage how unwise and foolish are they who
   think that they are in part excusable when they can say, that they have
   proceeded in their simplicity and have been drawn into error by the
   faults of others; for it appears evident that the whole community was
   in a hopeless state when God gave up the priests and rulers unto a
   reprobate mind; and there is no doubt but that the people had provoked
   God's vengeance, when every order, civil as well as religious, was thus
   corrupt. God then visited the people with deserved punishment, when he
   blinded the priests, the prophets, and the rulers.

   Hence Jeremiah now says, that the priests did not inquire where Jehovah
   was: and he adds, and they who keep the law, etc. The verb tphs
   taphesh, means to keep, to lay hold on, and sometimes to cover; so that
   there may be here a twofold meaning, -- that the priests kept the law,
   -- or, that they had it shut up as it were under their keeping. It
   would not, however, be in harmony with the passage to suppose that the
   law was suppressed by them; for God, by way of concession, speaks here
   honorably of them, thought he thereby shews that they were the more
   wicked, as they had no care for their office. He says, then, that they
   were the keepers of his law, not that they really kept the law, as
   though a genuine zeal for it prevailed among them, but because they
   professed this. They indeed wished to be thought the keepers of the
   law, who possessed the hidden treasure of celestial truth; for they
   wished to be consulted as though they were the organs of God's Spirit.
   Since, then, they boasted that they kept and preserved the law, the
   Prophet now more sharply rebukes them, because they knew not God
   himself. And Paul seems to have taken from this place what he says in
   the second chapter of the Epistle to the Romans,

   "Thou who hast the form of the law -- thou who preachest against
   adultery, committest adultery, and thou who condemnest idols art
   thyself guilty of sacrilege; for thou keepest the law, restest in it,
   boastest in God, and with thee is understanding and knowledge."
   (Romans 2:20-22.)

   Paul in these words detects the wickedness of hypocrites; for the more
   detestable they were, as they were thus inflated with false glory; they
   profaned the name of God, while they pretended to be his heralds, and
   as it were his prophets. We now see that this second clause refers to
   the priests, and that they are called the keepers of the law, because
   they were so appointed, according to what we read in Malachi. [34]

   He afterwards adds, The pastors have dealt treacherously with God We
   may apply this to the counselors of the king as well as to the
   governors of cities. The Prophet, I have no doubt, included all those
   who possessed authority to rule the people of God; for kings and their
   counselors, as well as prophets, are in common called pastors.

   And he says, that the prophets prophesied by Baal The name of prophet
   is sacred; but Jeremiah in this place, as in other places, calls those
   prophets (contrary to the real fact) who were nothing but impostors;
   for God had taken from them all the light of divine truth. But as they
   were held still in esteem by the people, as though they were prophets,
   the Prophet concedes this title to them, derived from their office and
   vocation. We do the same in the present day; we call those bishops and
   prelates, and primates and fathers, who under the papacy boast that
   they possess the pastoral office, and yet we know that some of them are
   wolves, and some are dumb dogs. We concede to them these titles in
   which they take pride; and yet a twofold condemnation impends over
   their heads, as they thus impiously, and with sacrilegious audacity,
   claim for themselves sacred titles, and deprive God of the honor
   rightly due to him. So then Jeremiah, speaking of the prophets, does
   now point out those as impostors who at that time wickedly deceived the
   people.

   He says that they prophesied by Baal: they ascribed more authority to
   idols than to the true God. The name of Baal, we know, was then
   commonly known. The prophets often call idols Baalim, in the plural
   number; but when Baal signifies a patron, when the prophets speak
   either of Baal in the singular number, or of Baalim in the plural, they
   mean the inferior gods, who had then been heaped together by the Jews,
   as though God was not content with his own power alone, but had need of
   associates and helpers, according to what is done at this day by those
   under the papacy, who confess that there is but one true God; and yet
   they ascribe nothing more to him than to their own idols which they
   invent for themselves at their pleasure. The same vice then prevailed
   among the Jews, and indeed among all heathen nations; for it was the
   plain and real confession of all, that there is but one supreme Being;
   and yet they had gods without number, and these all were called Baalim.
   When, therefore, the Prophet says here, that the teachers were
   ministers of Baal, he sets this name in opposition to the only true
   God, as though he had said that the truth was corrupted by them,
   because they passed over its limits, and did not acquiesce in the pure
   doctrine of the law, but mingled with it corruptions derived from all
   quarters, even from those many gods which heathen nations had invented
   for themselves.

   Nor does the Prophet insist on a name; for it may have been that these
   false teachers pretended to profess the name of the eternal God, though
   falsely. But God is no sophist: there is then no reason for the Papists
   to think that they are at this day unlike these ancient impostors,
   because they profess the name of the only true God. It has always been
   so. Satan has not begun for the first time at this day to transform
   himself into an angel of light; but all his teachers in all ages have
   presented their poison, even all their errors and fallacies, in a
   golden cup. Though, then, these prophets boasted that they were sent
   from above, and confidently affirmed that they were the servants of the
   God of Abraham, it was yet all an empty profession; for they mingled
   with the truth those corruptions which they had derived from the
   ungodly errors of heathen nations.

   It follows, And after those who do not profit have they gone [35] He
   again, by an implied comparison, exaggerates their sin, because they
   had despised him whom they had known, by so many evidences, to be their
   Father and the author of salvation, whose infinite power they had as it
   were felt by their own hands, and then they followed their own
   inventions, though there was nothing in all their idols which could
   have justly allured the people of Israel. Since, then, they followed
   vain and profitless deceptions, the more heinous and inexcusable was
   their sin. It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [33] It appears that the Prophet has already condemned the people in
   the foregoing portion of this chapter. In Jeremiah 1:18, we find the
   different classes thus arranged -- kings and princes, priests, the
   people of the land. At the beginning of this chapter, he addresses the
   people-the whole community, and here he names the priests, and the
   pastors, i.e., in the state, including kings and princes. Thus he
   reverses the order according to the common usage of Scripture: but to
   these are added here, prophets, because they were the spiritual
   pastors, as kings and princes were the civil. -- Ed.

   [34] Perhaps no better word can express the verb here used than that of
   our versions., "handle" --"they that handle the law," that is explain
   and teach it. To "handle the harp," is to play on it, Genesis 4:21; to
   "handle war," is to carry it on, Numbers 31:27; to "handle the oar," is
   to ply with it, Ezekiel 27:29; and to "handle the bow," is either to
   use it, or to know how to use it, Amos 2:15. They who handled the law
   were evidently those who undertook to explain and teach it to others.
   To lay hold on, seems to be the primary meaning of the verb, and that
   either for a good or a bad purpose. "The Scribes," observes Scott, "who
   undertook to expound the Scriptures, did not understand them." -- Ed.

   [35] Some say that idols are referred to; and others, as Calvin think
   that the false gods are intended: the meaning is the same; only the
   context seems more favorable to the latter idea. The Septuagint have a
   neuter adjective, "After what is profitless-anophelous -- have they
   gone." The verb for profit is plural; and if we take l' only as a
   negative, both the antecedent and relative are omitted: but l' here,
   and in Jeremiah 2:11, and in other places, is evidently a noun or a
   pronoun, signifying none or nothing: and like neb, none, in Welsh, it
   is either singular or plural, according to the verb in connection with
   it. It precedes here a verb in the plural number, and in Jeremiah 2:11,
   in the singular. The relative is often understood both in Hebrew and in
   Welsh before future verbs, and in both languages especially when the
   present time or act is intended. In the present instance, both
   languages may be considered to be literally the same. The Hebrew, word
   for word, may be thus rendered in Welsh: Arol neb a lesant y
   rhodiasant. After none (who) profit have they walked. That is, After
   none who can do them good have they gone. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:9

   9. Wherefore I will yet plead with you, saith the LORD, and with your
   children's children will I plead.

   9. Propterea adhuc contendam (vel, disceptabo) vobiscum, dicit Jehovah;
   et cum filiis filiorum vestrorum disceptabo.


   The particle vd oud, yet, or still, is not without weight; for the
   Prophet intimates, that if God had already punished the perfidy and
   wickedness of the people, he still retained whole his right to do so,
   as though he had said, "Think not that you have suffered all your
   punishment, though I have already severely visited your fathers for
   their wickedness and obstinacy; for as ye proceed in the same course,
   and as there is no moderation nor limits to your sins, I will not
   desist from what I have a right to do, but will punish to the last both
   you and your children, and all succeeding generations." We now then
   understand what the Prophet means.

   It is indeed usual with hypocrites foolishly to cast off all fear,
   especially after having been once chastised by the Lord; for they think
   it enough that they have suffered punishment for their sins; and they
   do not consider that God moderately punishes the sins of men to invite
   others to repentance, and that he is in such a way sharp and severe as
   yet to restrain himself, in order that there may be room for hope, and
   that they who have sinned, while waiting for pardon, may thus more
   readily and willingly return to the right way. This is what hypocrites
   do not consider; but they think that God on the first occasion expends
   all his rigor, and so they promise themselves impunity as to the
   future. As for instance, -- When God chastises a city, or a country,
   with war, pestilence, or famine, while the evils continue there is
   dread and anxiety: most of those whom God thus afflicts sigh and groan,
   and even howl; but as soon as some relaxation takes place, they shake
   off the yoke, and having no concern for their wickedness, they return
   again as dogs to their vomit. It is hence necessary to declare to
   hypocrites what we see to have been done here by Jeremiah, -- that God
   so visits men for their sins, that in future he ceases not to pursue
   the same course, when he sees men so refractory as not to profit under
   his scourges.

   Still, therefore, he says: this threat no doubt exasperated the minds
   of the nation: for as they dared to clamor against God, as we find in
   many places, and said that his ways were thorny, they spared not the
   prophets, and this we shall hereafter see: they indeed gave the
   prophets an odious character; and what? "These prophets," they said,
   "chatter nothing else but burdens, burdens, as though God ever
   fulminated against us; it would be better to close our ears than to be
   continually frightened by their words." It must then have been a severe
   thing to the Jews, when the Prophet said, Still God will contend with
   you But it was needful so to do.

   Let us then learn from this passage, that whenever God reproves us, not
   only in words, but in reality, and reminds us of our sins, we do not so
   suffer for one fault as to be free for the future, but that until we
   from the heart repent, he ever sounds in our ears these words, Still
   God will contend with you: and a real contention is meant; for Jeremiah
   speaks not of naked doctrine, but intimates that the Jews were to be
   led before God's tribunal, because they ceased not to provoke his
   wrath: [36] and he declares the same thing respecting their children
   and the third generation. It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [36] Gataker thinks that it was verbal pleading: "It is as if he had
   said, I have argued the case with your forefathers already, let me
   debate the matter a little further with you, and let your posterity
   also consider well what I now say, (see Deuteronomy 31:19, 21.) And so
   is the same word afterwards used for debating the case or pleading,
   verse 29 (Jeremiah 2:29)." Henry, Adam Clarke, and Blayney, take the
   same view; but Scott seems to agree with Calvin The verb rvv, followed
   as it is here by 't, ever means a verbal dispute or contention. See
   Numbers 20:13; Nehemiah 13:11, 17; Proverb 25:9; Isaiah 45:9. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 2:10-11

   10. For pass over the isles of Chittim, and see; and send unto Kedar,
   and consider diligently, and see if there be such a thing.

   10. Nempe (vel, nam) transite ad insulas Chittim (Graeciae, hoc est, ad
   omnes regiones transmarinas,) et videte, et in Kedar (hoc est, in
   oppositam partem, nempe versus Aratbiam) mittite, et considerate
   diligenter, et videte, an factum sit sicut hoc (id est, an factum sit
   aliquid simile:)

   11. Hath a nation changed their gods, which are yet no gods? but my
   people have changed their glory for that which doth not profit,

   11. An mutaverit gens deos, et ipsi non sunt dii? et populus meus
   mutavit gloriam suam in id quod non prodest.


   Here, by a comparison, he amplifies the wickedness and ingratitude of
   his own nation, -- that they had surpassed in levity all heathen
   nations; for he says that all nations so agreed in one religion, that
   each nation followed what it had received from its ancestors. How then
   was it that the God of Israel was repudiated and rejected by his own
   people? If there was such persistency in error, why did not truth
   secure credit among them who had been taught by the mouth of God
   himself, as though they had been even in heaven? This is the drift of
   the Prophet's meaning, when he says, Go into the islands of Chittim,
   and send into Kedar

   He mentions Greece on one side, and the East on the other, and states a
   part for the whole. The Hebrews, as we have seen in Daniel, called the
   Greeks Chittim, though they indeed thought that the term belonged
   properly to the Macedonians; but the Prophet no doubt included in that
   term not only the whole of Greece and the islands of the Mediterranean,
   but also the whole of Europe, so as to take in those parts, the whole
   of France and Spain. There is indeed some difference made in the use of
   the word; but when taken generally, it was understood by the Hebrews,
   as I have said, to include France, Spain, Germany, as well as Greece;
   and they called those countries islands, though distant from the sea,
   because they carried on no commerce with remote nations: hence they
   thought the countries beyond the sea to be islands; and the Prophet
   spoke according to what was customary. [37]

   He then bids them to pass into the islands, southward as well as
   northward; and then he bids them, on the other hand, to send to explore
   the state of the East, Arabia as well as India, Persia, and other
   countries; for under the word Kedar he includes all the nations of the
   East; and as that people were more barbarous than others, he mentions
   them rather than the Persians or the Medes, or any other more
   celebrated nation, in order more fully to expose the disgraceful
   conduct of the Jews. Go then, or send, to all parts of the world, and
   see and diligently consider, see and see again; as though he said, that
   so great was the stupidity of the Jews, that they could not be awakened
   by a single word, or by one admonition. This then is the reason why he
   bids them carefully to inquire, though the thing itself was very plain
   and obvious. But this careful inquiry, as I have said, was enforced not
   on account of the obscurity of the subject, but for the purpose of
   reproving the sottishness of that perverse nation, which must have been
   conscious of its gross impiety, and yet indulged itself in its own
   vices.

   Hence he says, Yea, pass over unto the islands; and then he adds, see
   whether there is a thing like this; that is, such a monstrous and
   execrable thing can nowhere be found. An explanation follows, No nation
   has changed its gods, and yet they are no gods; that is, religion among
   all nations continues the same, so that they do not now and then change
   their gods, but worship those who have been as it were handed down to
   them by their fathers. And yet, he says, they are no gods If it had
   been only said, that no nation has changed its gods, the impiety of
   Israel would not have been so grievously exposed; but the Prophet takes
   it for granted, that all the nations were deceived and led away after
   fictitious gods, and yet remained constant in their delusions. Now, God
   does not set this forth as a virtue; he does not mean that the
   constancy of the nations was worthy of praise in not departing from
   their own superstitions; but, compared with the conduct of the chosen
   people, this constancy might however appear as laudable. We hence see
   that the whole is to be thus read connectively, -- "Though no nation
   worships the true God, yet religion remains unchangeable among them
   all; and yet ye have perfidiously forsaken me, and you have not
   forsaken a mere phantom, but your glory."

   He sets here the favor of God in opposition to the delusions of false
   gods, when he says, My people have changed their own glory For the
   people knew, not only through the teaching of the law, but also by sure
   evidences, that God was their glory; and yet they departed from him. It
   is then the same as though Jeremiah had said, that all the nations
   would condemn the Israelites at the last day, because their very
   persistency in error would prove the greater wickedness of the Jews,
   inasmuch as they were apostates from the true God, and from that God
   who had so clearly manifested to them his power.

   Now, if one asks, whether religion has been changed by any of the
   nations? First, we know that this principle prevailed everywhere, --
   that there was to be no innovation in the substance of religion: and
   Xenophon highly commends this oracle of Apollo, -- that those gods were
   rightly worshipped who have been received by tradition from ancestors.
   The devil had thus bewitched all nations, -- "No novelty can please
   God; but be ye content with the usual custom which has descended to you
   from your forefathers." This principle then was held by the Greeks and
   the Asiatics, and also by Europeans. It was therefore for the most part
   true what the Prophet says here: and we know that when a comparison is
   made, it is enough if the illustration is for the most part, epi to
   polu, as Aristotle says, confirmed by custom and constant practice. We
   hence see that the charge of levity against the Jews was not unsuitably
   brought by Jeremiah, when he said, that no nation had changed its gods,
   but that God had been forsaken by his people whose glory he was; that
   is, to whom he had given abundant reasons for glorying. [38]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [37] Parkhurst doubts whether the word 'yym, rendered islands, has ever
   strictly that meaning. He renders the singular, 'y, a settlement, a
   habitation, and refers to Job 22:30; Isaiah 20:6; and says, that the
   plural, in Isaiah 42:15, ought to be rendered "habitable places," and
   not "islands," as in our version. It may be rendered here, "countries,"
   as by Blarney. -- Ed

   [38] "Their glory" are by some considered to be God himself, and not
   the glory, that is, the honor, dignity, and greatness which he bestowed
   on the people, as Calvin here intimates: but the latter is more
   consistent with what follows, which literally is, "for nothing that
   profits:" for the l' here, as in Jeremiah 2:8, is evidently a noun, or
   a pronoun. The comparison here is between what God gives and what false
   gods give; the comparison before was between God himself and the false
   gods. God gives glory, renders his people great and illustrious; but
   the false gods give nothing that profits, that really benefits, or does
   any good. -- Ed

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast made thyself known to us in
   so plain a manner, not only by thy law and prophets, but also by thine
   only -- begotten Son, that the knowledge of thy truth ought to have
   already struck deep roots in us, -- O grant, that we may continue firm
   and constant in thy holy vocation, and make continual progress in it,
   and ever hasten forward to the goal: and do thou so humble us under thy
   mighty hand, that we may know that we are paternally chastised by thee,
   and profit under thy discipline, until being at length purified from
   all our vices we shall come to enjoy that immortal life, which has been
   made known to us by Christ, when we shall be able fully to rejoice in
   thee. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 2:12

   12. Be astonished, O ye heavens, at this, and be horribly afraid, be ye
   very desolate, saith the LORD.

   12. Obstupescite coeli super hoc, et expavescite, desolamini (vel,
   arescite) valde, dicit Jehova.


   When the Prophet saw that he had to do with besotted men, almost void
   of all reason, he turned to address the heavens: and it is a way of
   speaking, common in the Prophets, -- that they address the heaven and
   the earth, which have no understanding, and leave men endued with
   reason and knowledge. This they were wont to do in hopeless cases, when
   they found no disposition to learn.

   Hence now the Prophet bids the heavens to be astonished and to be
   terrified and to be reduced as it were unto desolation; as though he
   had said, "This is a wonder, which almost confounds the whole order of
   nature; it is the same as though we were to see heaven and earth mixed
   together." We now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet: for by this
   representation he intended to shew, how detestable was the impiety of
   the people, since the heavens, though destitute of reason, ought justly
   to dread such a monstrous thing.

   As to the words, some render them, "Be desolate, ye heavens," and then
   repeat the same: but as smm shemem, means to be astonished, the
   rendering I have given suits the present passage better, "Be
   astonished, ye heavens, for this," and then, "be ye terrified and dried
   up;" for: chrv chareb, signifies to become dry, and sometimes, to be
   reduced to a solitude or a waste. [39] It afterwards follows: --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [39] Blarney, following the Septuagint, renders the verbs as in the
   third person plural. "The heavens are astonished," etc.; but it is
   better to take them as being in the second person in the imperative
   mood, as both Aquila and Symmachus do. Similar passages are so
   construed, see Isaiah 1:2. There is alliteration in the two first
   words, as though we said in our language, "Heave, ye heavens:" and
   there is a gradation in the expressions -- be astonished -- be
   horrified -- be wholly wasted, or consumed, or dried up, -- Astonished
   be ye, the heavens, for this, And be horrified, Be ye wholly wasted,
   saith Jehovah. The alteration in the last verb, in accordance with the
   Syriac, chrdv, which means to "tremble," instead of chrvv, though
   proposed by Secker and approved by Horsley, is by no means necessary,
   and countenanced by no MSS. Nor is the emendation of Blarney, in
   conformity with the Septuagint, to be at all approved. These
   alterations are not only unnecessary, but destroy the expressive and
   striking character of the passage. Learned men are sometimes led too
   much by an innovating spirit. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 2:13

   13. For my people have committed two evils; they have forsaken me the
   fountain of living waters, and hewed them out cisterns, broken
   cisterns, that can hold no water.

   13. Certe (vel quia) duo mala fecit populus meus, Me dereliquerunt
   fontem aquarum viventium, ut foderent sibi puteos (vel, cisternas,)
   cisternas contritas (vel, confractas,) quae non continent aquas.


   If a reason is given here why the Prophet had bidden the heavens to be
   astonished and terrified, then we must render the words thus, "For two
   evils have my people done:" but I rather think that the preceding verse
   is connected with the former verses. The Prophet had said, "Go to the
   farthest lands, and see whether any nation has changed its gods, while
   yet they are mere inventions." I think then the subject is closed with
   the exclamation in the preceding verse, when the Prophet says, "Be
   astonished, ye heavens." It then follows, "Surely, two evils have my
   people done," even these, -- "they have forsaken me," -- and then,
   "they sought for themselves false gods." When any one forsakes an old
   friend and connects himself with a new one, it is an iniquitous and a
   base conduct: but when there is no compensation, there is in it united
   together, folly, levity, and madness. If I despise what I know to be
   profitable to me, and embrace what I understand will be to my hurt,
   does not such a choice prove madness? This then is what the Prophet now
   means, when he says, that the people had sinned not only by departing
   from the true God, but also by going over, without any compensation,
   unto idols, which could confer no good on them.

   He says that they had done two evils: the first was, they had forsaken
   God; and the other, they had fallen away unto false and imaginary gods.
   But the more to amplify their sin, he makes use of a similitude, and
   says that God is a fountain of living waters; and he compares idols to
   perforated or broken cisterns, which hold no water [40] When one leaves
   a living fountain and seeks a cistern, it is a proof of great folly;
   for cisterns are dry except water comes elsewhere; but a fountain has
   its own spring; and further, where there is a vein perpetually flowing,
   and a perennial stream of waters, the water is more salubrious and much
   better. The waters which rain brings into cisterns are never so
   wholesome as those which flow from their own native vein: and when the
   very receptacles of water are full of chinks, what must they be but
   empty? Hence then God charges the people with madness, because he was
   forsaken, who was a fountain and a fountain of living waters; and
   further, because the people sought unprofitable things when they went
   after their idols. For what is to be found in idols? some likeness; for
   the superstitious think that they labor not in vain, when they worship
   false gods, and they hope to derive some benefit. There are then some
   resemblances to the true in false religions; and hence the Prophet
   compares false gods to wells, because they were made hollow, suitable
   to hold water; but there was not a drop of water in them, as they were
   broken cisterns.

   We now perceive what the Prophet meant, -- that we cannot possibly be
   free from guilt when we leave the only true God, as in him is found for
   us a fullness of all blessings, and from him we may draw what may fully
   satisfy us. When therefore we despise the bounty of God, which is
   sufficient to make us in every way happy, how great must be our
   ingratitude and wickedness? Yet God remains ever like himself: as then
   he has called himself the fountain of living waters, we shall at this
   day find him to be so, except he is prevented by our wickedness and
   neglect. But the Prophet adds another crime; for when we fall away from
   God, our own conceits deceive us; and whatever may appear to us at the
   first view to be wells or fountains, yet when thirst shall come, we
   shall not find a drop of water in all our devices, they being nothing
   else but dry cavities. It follows --

   [40] Blarney innovated here, because he seemed not rightly to
   distinguish between the two words that are here used. Both are rendered
   "cisterns" in our version; but they are two distinct words, though they
   are similar, and mean similar or the same things. The first is v'rvt,
   pits, and the other is v'rt in our received text, but ought evidently
   to be vrvt, or, as in one MS., vvrt, which means "wells" or pools. The
   first is a feminine noun, the last is a masculine noun; and hence we
   find that the adjective added here to the last word is masculine, as in
   other places, see Deuteronomy 6:11; 2 Chronicles 26:10; Nehemiah 9:25;
   while the first is accompanied with adjectives in the feminine gender.
   The verse may be thus rendered, -- For two evils have my people done,
   -- Me have they forsaken, the fountain of living waters; In order to
   dig for themselves pits, Broken wells, which cannot hold water. It is
   singular that Adam Clarke should say that these cisterns were "vessels
   in put together," since they were pits dug in the ground to receive
   rain-water. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:14-17

   14 Is Israel a servant? is he a homeborn slave? why is he spoiled?

   14. An servus Israel? An (vel, si) genitus domi? (hoc est, an verna?
   accipiunt enim puerum, domi natum pro verna:) quare factus est in
   praedam?

   15. The young lions roared upon him, and yelled, and they made his land
   waste: his cities are burned without inhabitant.

   15. Super eum rugient (vel, rugiunt) leones (alii vertunt, catulos
   leonum, et soepe significat minores leones hoc nomen sed ubi adjungitur
   reliquis, ubi autem solum ponitur, ego semper interpretor generaliter
   pro leonibus,) miserunt vocem suam; posuerunt terram ejus in
   vastitatem; urbes ejus exustae sunt (vel, destructae, nam, tststs
   tandem valet atque hoc loco) absque habitatore.

   16. Also the children of Noph and Tahapanes have broken the crown of
   thy head.

   16. Etiam filii Noph (hoc est, Mempheos, vocant enim Hebroei Noph urbem
   quae fuit olim metropolis Egypti) et Thaphanes (vel, Thaphis, ut
   vertunt Grraeci) frangent tibi verticem.

   17. Hast thou not procured this unto thyself, in that thou hast
   forsaken the LORD thy God, when he led thee by the way?

   17. An non hoc fuit tibi, deserere tuum, (hoc est, quod deserueris)
   Jehovam Deum tuum, quo tempore ducebat to per viam.


   These verses are to be read together; for the Prophet first shews that
   Israel was not as to his original condition miserable, but that this
   happened through a new cause, and then he mentions the cause. He then
   first asks, whether Israel was a servant or a slave? God had adopted
   them as his people, and had promised to be so bountiful to them as to
   render them in every way happy; and what was more, as a proof of their
   happiness, he said, In thee shall all nations be blessed. (Genesis
   12:3; Genesis 22:18; Genesis 26:4; Genesis 28:14.) We then see what was
   the original condition of Israel; they excelled all other nations,
   because they were God's peculiar people, they were his heritage, they
   were a royal priesthood.

   Hence the Prophet, as though astonished at something new and strange,
   asks this question, Is Israel a servant? He was free beyond all
   nations; for he was the first -- born son of God: it was therefore
   necessary to inquire for the cause why he was so miserable; for he says
   afterwards, that lions roared against him, and sent forth their voice;
   he says, that their cities were burnt, or destroyed; he says, that
   their land was reduced to desolation; and at length he adds, Has not
   this done these things to thee? This again is put as a question, but it
   is doubly affirmative, for it takes away every doubt: "What do you say
   is the cause why you are so miserable? for all are hostile to you, and
   you are exposed to the wrongs of all: whence can you say has all this
   proceeded, except from your own wickedness?" We now see what the
   Prophet means.

   But that what he says may be more clear, we must remember that he
   reminds the people, by way of reproach, of the benefits which God had
   conferred on them. As then the children of Abraham had been honored
   with so many singular favors that they had the preeminence over all the
   world, this dignity is now referred to, but only for the purpose of
   exposing their base conduct, as though he had said, "God did not
   deceive you, when he promised to be bountiful to you; his adoption is
   not deceptive nor in vain: hence you would have been happier than all
   other nations, had not your own wickedness rendered you miserable." We
   now see for what end the Prophet asked, Is Israel a servant or a slave?
   They were indeed on an equality with other people, as they were by
   nature; but as they had been chosen by God, and as he had favored them
   with that peculiar privilege, the Prophet asks, whether they were
   servants, as though he had said, "What is it that prevents that
   blessedness to appear among you, which God has promised? for it was not
   God's design to disappoint you: it then follows that you are miserable
   through your own fault." [41]

   And by saying, Why is he become a prey, he intimates that except Israel
   had been deprived of God's protection, they would not have been thus
   exposed to the caprice of their enemies. They were not then become a
   prey except for this reason, because God had forsaken them, according
   to what is said in the song of Moses,

   "How should one chase a thousand, and ten should put to flight as many
   thousands, except God had given us up as captives, except we had been
   shut up by his hand."
   (Deuteronomy 32:30.)

   For Moses in that passage does also in an indirect manner remind the
   people how often and how wonderfully God had given them victories over
   their enemies, and thus he leaves it to their posterity, when in
   distress, to consider how the change came that one should chase a
   thousand; that is, how could it be, that they, possessing great forces,
   should yet be put to flight by their enemies; for they were not wont to
   turn their backs, but to conquer their enemies: it then follows, that
   they were made captives by God, and not by the men who chased them. So
   also here the Prophet shews, that Israel would not have been made a
   prey, had they not been deprived of God's assistance.

   He afterwards adds, Over him roar the lions. The Prophet seems not
   simply to compare the enemies of Israel to lions on account of their
   cruelty, but also by way of contempt, as though he had said, that
   Israel found that not only men were incensed against them, but also
   wild beasts: and it is more degrading when God permits us to be torn by
   the beasts of the field. It is then the same, as though he had said,
   that Israel were so miserably treated, that they were not only slain by
   the hands of enemies, but were also exposed to the beasts of prey. And
   then he adds, they have sent forth their voice; which is the same as to
   say, that Israel, whom God was wont to protect by his powerful band,
   were become the food of wild beasts, and that lions, as it were in
   troops, were roaring against them.

   He then adds, without a metaphor, that his land was laid waste, and his
   cities burnt without an inhabitant This language cannot be suitably
   applied to lions or to any other wild beasts; but what he had
   figuratively said before, he now explains in a plain manner, and says,
   that the land was desolate, that the cities were cut off or burnt up.
   Now this, as we have said, could not have been the case, had not Israel
   departed from God, and had been on this account deprived of his help.
   [42]

   By way of amplification he adds, Also the sons of Noph and of Tephanes
   shall for thee break the head, or, the crown of the head. We shall
   hereafter see that the Israelites were wont to seek help from the
   Egyptians. The particle gm, gam, may be thus explained, "Not only those
   who have been hitherto professed enemies to thee, but even thy friends,
   in whose help thou didst confide, shall turn their power against thee
   and break for thee thy head." Some think that their degradation is here
   enhanced, because the Egyptians were an unwarlike people; and ancient
   historians say that men there followed the occupations of women; but as
   this is not mentioned in Scripture, and as the Egyptians are not thus
   spoken of in it, I prefer to follow the usual explanation, that the
   Egyptians, though confederate with Israel, would yet be adverse to
   them, and had been so already. By the head, some understand the chief
   men among the people of Israel: but we may render it thus, they will
   break for thee the head, as we say in our language, Ils to romperont la
   tete, or, Ils to frotteront la tete; and this, in my judgment, is the
   real meaning. [43]

   Now follows the cause; the Prophet, after having shewn that Israel were
   forsaken by God, now mentions the reason why it so happened, Has not
   this done it for thee? Some read in the second person, "Hast thou not
   done this for thee?" but the meaning is still nearly the same. More
   probable, however, is the rendering which others have given, "Has not
   this happened to thee, because thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God?"
   Jeremiah, in short, teaches us that the cause of all the evils was the
   defection of the people, as though he had said, "Thou hast concocted
   for thyself all this evil; then must thou swallow it, and know that the
   blame cannot be cast on God; for he would have been faithful to thee,
   except thine impiety had prevented him. God has not, indeed, chosen
   thee in vain, nor has he in vain preferred thee to other nations; but
   thou hast rejected his kindness. Thy condition then would have never
   been as it is, hadst thou not procured thine own ruin." How so?
   "Because thou hast departed from thy God."

   And he further exaggerates this sin by saying, At the time when he led
   thee in the way To lead in the way, is rightly to govern, so as to make
   people happy. The Prophet then shews, that the people's perfidy and
   defection were without excuse in rejecting the worship of their God,
   for they were happy during the time they served him. Had they been in
   various ways tempted, or tried, they might have reigned some pretense.
   "We thought ourselves deceived in hoping in the true God, for he
   concealed his favor from us; we were therefore compelled by necessity.
   There ought at least some indulgence to be shewn to our levity; for we
   could have formed no other conjecture but that God had removed far from
   us." The Prophet meets this objection, as he does in the fifth verse,
   "What iniquity have your fathers found in me?" and, as it is done in
   another place,

   "My people, what have I done to thee, or in what have I been
   troublesome to thee?"
   (Micah 6:4)

   for God in that passage shews that he was prepared to defend his own
   cause, and to clear himself from whatever the people might object to
   him. So also he does in this place, "I have led thee," he says, "in the
   way;" that is, "Thou didst live happily under my government, and yet I
   could not retain thee by my goodness while I kindly treated thee; and
   thou knewest that nothing could be better for thee than to continue
   under my protection; but thou hast determined to go over into the
   service of idols. Now what excuse hast thou, or what pretense is left
   thee?" We hence see, that the sin of the people is greatly enhanced,
   for they were induced by no temptation or trial to forsake God, but
   through mere perfidy gave themselves up to idols: and a confirmation of
   this verse follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [41] The difficulty of understanding this passage has arisen from not
   considering the questions in a negative sense, as implying a strong
   denial-"Is Israel a servant (or, rather a slave)?" No, by no means. "Is
   he one begotten in the house," that is, in a state of bondage? No, by
   no means. Then the following question comes naturally; since he is
   neither a purchased slave, nor a slave born in the house, "why has he
   become a prey?" That there were two sorts of slaves of this kind is
   evident from many parts of Scripture. See Genesis 17:12, Genesis 17:23,
   Genesis 17:27; Exodus 21:4; Leviticus 22: 11. This is the view taken
   evidently in our version, by Jun and Trem., Piscator, Gataker, Grotius,
   Henry, and Scott. Blarney renders the two first lines thus, -- Is
   Israel a slave? or if a child of the household, Wherefore is he exposed
   to spoil? He considers "the child of the household" to be the son and
   the heir, as Isaac was, and refers to Galatians 4:7. Horsley coincides
   with him. But the usus loquendi gives no countenance to this view,
   while it confirms the other. To refer to filiusfamilias in Latin is to
   no purpose. "The child of the house," as the expression literally is,
   and similar phrases, ever mean in Scripture those who were born slaves
   in a family. -- Ed.

   [42] The verse literally is as follows,- Over him shall young lions
   roar;
   They have uttered their voice,
   And have made his land a waste;
   His cities are grown over with grass,
   Without an inhabitant. The verb in the first line is future, the other
   verbs are in the past tense; and Blarney thinks that they are so put to
   denote the certainty of what is said, as it is often done by the
   prophets: and this is rendered probable by what is contained in
   Jeremiah 4:7, where the same judgment is spoken of. The verb ntsth, in
   the received text, ought evidently to be ntstv, according to the Keri
   and twenty MSS.; and so we find it in Jeremiah 9:10. Our version and
   Calvin give it the idea of "burning;" but according to Leigh and
   Parkhurst, its meaning is, to shoot forth, to produce grass, or to grow
   over with grass, as the case is with ruined cities; and the words
   connected with it here and in other places seem to favor this meaning.
   It is rendered in our version, "laid waste," in Jeremiah 4:7, and
   "desolate" in Jeremiah 46:19. -- Ed

   [43] There have been many expositions of this latter clause, which may
   be seen in the Assembly's Annotations, which were written, as to Isaiah
   and Jeremiah, by the learned Gataker. He gives the preference to the
   idea, that the crown of the head means the best and the principal part
   of the land, and to break the crown means the plunder of this portion.
   See Isaiah 28:4. This seems to correspond in meaning with the previous
   verse. It was the opinion of Blarney that an allusion is prophetically
   made to the slaying of Josiah by the Egyptians. The words literally
   are, -- They shall break thee, the crown of the head. "The crown of the
   head" seems to be explanatory of "thee;" it might then be rendered, --
   They shall break thee, even the crown of thy head. The Septuagint
   mistook one letter for another, and took the verb to be, ydvk, "they
   knew thee," instead of yrvk "they shall break thee;" but what they made
   the last word to be, it is hard to know, for they rendered it, "and
   searched thee." The Vulgate has followed the Septuagint; and the idea
   is a very indecent one: and there is nothing in the context to favor
   it. The Targum's paraphrase is this, "They shall slay thy brave men,
   and plunder thy riches;" which countenances the idea evidently conveyed
   by the figurative terms of the Hebrew. The next verse literally
   rendered is as follows, -- Is not this what thou wilt do for thyself,
   By thy forsaking of Jehovah thy God,
   At the time he was leading thee in the way? The first verb is no doubt
   future, whether it be rendered in the second or third person. The
   sentence may be rendered in Welsh without "Is," or the relative "what,"
   and word for word, -- Ai nid hyn a wnai i'th hun? And the future is
   understood as the present. Blayney's version is, -- Shall not this be
   done unto thee,
   Because thou hast forsaken Jehovah thy God,
   At the time that he led thee in the way? -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:18

   18. And now what hast thou to do in the way of Egypt, to drink the
   waters of Sihor? or what hast thou to do in the way of Assyria, to
   drink the waters of the river?

   18. Et nunc quid tibi ad viam Egypti, ut bibas aquas Nili? et quid tibi
   ad viam Assur, ut bibas aquam fluminis? (Nempe, Eeuphratis.)


   As I have just stated, the Prophet confirms what I said, -- that the
   people could not ascribe the cause of their evils to others; for they
   ought to have imputed to themselves whatever they suffered; and at the
   same time their sin was doubled, because they looked here and there for
   vain remedies, and thus accumulated for themselves new causes of
   misery; for they ought to have acknowledged no other remedy for their
   evils except reconciliation with God. If, for instance, any one being
   ill knew the cause of his disease, and instead of adopting the true
   remedy had recourse to some vain expedients injurious to his recovery,
   is he not deemed worthy to die for having willfully despised what might
   have healed him, and for indulging himself in what is deceptive and
   fallacious? The same thing does Jeremiah now reprove in the people of
   Israel. "If you carefully inquire," saith God, "how it is that you are
   so miserable, you will find that this cannot be ascribed to me, but to
   your own sins. Now, then, what ought you to have done? what remedy
   ought you to have sought, except to reconcile yourselves to me, to seek
   pardon from me, and to strive to correct your wickedness? I would then
   have immediately healed you; and had you come to me, you would have
   found me the best physician. And why do you now act in a way quite
   contrary? for you run after vain helps; now you flee to Egypt, then you
   flee to Assyria; but you will gain nothing by these expedients." We now
   understand the object of the Prophet. For after having proved the
   people to be guilty of impiety, and shewn that the evils which they
   suffered could be ascribed neither to God nor to chance, nor to any
   such causes, he now shews to them, that the one true remedy was to
   return into favor with God; but that it was an evidence of extreme
   madness to run now to Egypt, and then to Assyria.

   Now this reproof is supported by history; for the people had at one
   time the Assyrians as their enemies, and at another the Egyptians; and
   the changes were many. God employed different scourges to awaken the
   sottishness of the people; at one time, he whistled for the Egyptians,
   as we shall presently see; at another, he blew the trumpet in Assyria:
   so that the Israelites might know that they could never be safe without
   being under the government of God. But all these things being
   overlooked, such was the blindness of the people, that when they were
   assailed by the Assyrians, they fled to Egypt and sought aid from the
   Egyptians, and entered into a treaty with them; afterwards, when a
   change occurred, they sought a treaty with the Assyrians, and also
   bought it at a high price.

   This madness is what the Prophet now reprobates, when he says, What
   hast thou to do in the way of Egypt? that is, "What advantage dost thou
   gain? How great is thy folly, since thou knowest that God is angry with
   thee, and that thou art suffering many evils? God is adverse to thee,
   and yet thou thinkest nothing of reconciliation. Thy healing would be
   to flee to God and to be reconciled to him; but what dost thou now do?
   Thou fleest to the Assyrians and to the Egyptians. How wretched is thy
   condition, and how great is thy folly in thus wearying thyself without
   any advantage!"

   Now we may learn from this passage, that whenever God chastises us for
   our sins, we ought to seek a remedy, and not to rest in those vain
   comforts which Satan often suggests; for such charms introduce
   drowsiness, and healable diseases are by such means rendered fatal.
   What then ought we to do? We ought, as soon as we feel the scourges of
   God, to seek to return into favor with him; and not in vain shall be
   our effort. But if we look around us in all directions for help, our
   evils shall not be lessened but increased. To drink the waters of the
   Nile, and to drink the waters of Euphrates, is nothing else but to seek
   aids here and there.

   He indeed alludes to the legations which had been sent; for they who
   went to Egypt drank of the waters of the Nile, and others of Euphrates.
   He yet speaks metaphorically, as though he had said, "God was ready to
   help thee, hadst thou betaken thyself to his mercy as thine asylum; but
   having neglected him, thou thoughtest it more advantageous to have such
   aids as Egypt and Assyria could bring. Thou thus seekest drink in
   remote countries, while God could give thee waters." And he seems to
   refer to the similitude which he had shortly before used: he had called
   God the fountain of living waters; as though he had said, "God is to
   thee a refreshing and perennial fountain, and there would be abundance
   of waters for thee wert thou satisfied with him; but thy desire is to
   drink the waters of the Nile, and the waters of the Euphrates." [44] We
   now then perceive the meaning of the Prophet.

   He, no doubt, speaks of the waters of the Nile and of the Euphrates,
   because both those nations abounded apparently in wealth and power and
   in military forces. As, then, the people of Israel trusted in such
   auxiliaries, the Prophet here reproves their ingratitude, because they
   were not content with God's help, though that was not so visible and
   conspicuous. God, indeed, has help sufficient for us; and were we
   content with him alone, no doubt an abundance of good things would to a
   full satisfaction be given to us; and as he is not wearied in doing
   good, he would supply us with whatever is desirable: but as we cannot
   see his beneficence with carnal eyes, we are therefore carried away
   after the allurements of the world. We may hence learn that we are not
   to seek drink either from the Nile or from the Euphrates, that is, from
   the enticing things of the world, which make a great shew and display;
   but that we are, on the contrary, to drink from the hidden fountain
   which is concealed from us, in order that we may seek it by faith. It
   now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [44] No doubt this is the peculiar import of the passage, as though the
   Prophet had said, "What good to thee is to travel to Egypt to drink the
   waters of Sihor, a muddy river, (as the word imports;) and what good to
   thee is to travel to Assyria to drink the waters of the river, while
   thou hast at home a fountain of living, pure and perennial waters?" So
   Gataker considers the drift of the passage: -- "To drink the water of
   Nilus in Egypt is put here for to seek help and relief there: but he
   delivereth it in these terms, as if he should say, that they could have
   nothing to do there, or no errand thither, unless it were to drink of
   the puddle water of that river, when they had, or might have had, as
   good, yea, far better than that, nearer at hand, at home. See Jeremiah
   18:14; so 2 Kings 1:3." Then the plainest version would be thus, -- And
   now, what hast thou to do with a journey to Egypt, That thou mightest
   drink the waters of Sihor? And what hast thou to do with a journey to
   Assyria, That thou mightest drink the waters of the river? The
   comparison evidently is between the waters of Sihor and of the river
   Euphrates, and the living waters. As in other parts of Scripture the
   Euphrates is no doubt meant by the river, though here, as in Psalm
   80:11, and Isaiah 7:20, the article h is not prefixed to it. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 2:19

   19. Thine own wickedness shall correct thee, and thy backslidings shall
   reprove thee: know therefore and see that it is an evil thing and
   bitter, that thou hast forsaken the LORD thy God, and that my fear is
   not in thee, saith the Lord GOD of hosts.

   19. Castigabit to malitia tua, et aversiones tuae, (vel, defectiones
   tuae) poenam de to exigent; et cognosces et scies, quod malum et amarum
   tuum derelinquere (ad verbum, hoc est, quod reliqueris) Jehovam Deum
   tuum, et quod timor meus super to non fuerit, dixit Dominus Jehova
   exeercitum.


   Here again, the Prophet confirms what I have before stated, -- that the
   people would at length find, willing or unwilling, what it was to
   deport from God; as though he had said, "As thou hast not hitherto
   learnt by so many evidences, that thy perfidy is the cause of all thy
   evils, God will heap evils on evils, that thou mayest at length know,
   even against thy will, that thou receivest, a reward due to thy
   wickedness." This is the sum of the whole.

   But he says first, chastise thee shall thy wickedness, as though he had
   said, that though God ascended not his tribunal, nor put forth his hand
   to punish the people, yet judgment would be evident in their very sins.
   And this is much more powerful, and has greater weight in it than if
   the Prophet had said only, that God would inflict on the people a just
   punishment; thy wickedness, he says, shall chastise thee; and a similar
   mode of speaking is adopted by Isaiah;

   "Stand;" he says, "against thee shall thy wickedness,"
   (Isaiah 3:9; Isaiah 59:12)

   as though God had said, "If I were even to be silent and not to take
   upon me the office of a judge, and if there were no other accuser, and
   no one to plead the cause, yet stand against thee will thy wickedness,
   and fill thee with shame." To the same purpose is what is said here,
   thy wickedness [45] shall chastise thee

   But we must consider the reason why the Prophet said this. There were
   then, we know, complaints in the mouths of many, -- that God was too
   rigid and severe. Since then they thus continually clamored against
   God; the Prophet repels such calumnies, and says that their wickedness
   was sufficient to account for the vengeance executed upon them. He says
   the same of their turnings aside; [46] but what he had said generally
   before, he now expresses more particularly, -- that the people had
   withdrawn themselves from the worship of God and obedience to him. He
   therefore points out here the kind of wickedness of which they were
   guilty, as though he had said that there was no need of an accuser, of
   witnesses, or of a judge, but that the defections of the people alone
   would sufficiently avail to punish them.

   He afterwards adds, Thou shalt know and see how wicked and bitter it is
   to forsake Jehovah thy God These are words hard in their construction;
   but we have already explained the meaning; "Thy forsaking," or thy
   defection, means, "that thou hast forsaken thy God." And my fear was
   not on, or, in thee Here, again, the Prophet points out as by the
   finger the sins of the people. He had before spoken of their turnings
   aside; but he now mentions their defection, -- that the people had
   plainly and openly departed from the true God. They, indeed, ever
   continued some kind of worship in the Temple: but as the whole of
   religion was corrupted by many superstitions, and as there was no
   fidelity, no sincerity; and as they mingled the worship of idols with
   that of the true God, they had dearly departed from God, who is jealous
   of his honor, according to what is in the law, and allows of no rivals.
   (Exodus 20:5; Exodus 34:14) We now then perceive the meaning of the
   Prophet.

   He says, Thou shalt know that it is an evil and a bitter thing, etc.
   This must be applied to punishment; and he repeats what he had said
   before, -- that the evils which the people then suffered did not happen
   by chance, and that as they were overwhelmed with many bitter sorrows,
   the cause was not to be sought afar off, for their bitterness, and
   whatever calamities they endured, flowed from their impiety. Thou shalt
   then know by the reward itself; even experience will convince thee what
   it is to depart from God; and he says, from Jehovah thy God, or, to
   forsake Jehovah thy God. For, if God had not made known his grace to
   the Israelites, their perverseness would not have been so detestable;
   but since they had found God to be a Father to them, and since he had
   so bountifully treated them, having been pleased to enter into a
   covenant with them, their wickedness was inexcusable.

   And afterwards the person is changed, And my fear was not in thee Here
   at length the Prophet intimates, that they were destitute of every
   sense of religion; for by the fear of God is meant reverence for his
   name. Men often fall, we know, through mistake, and are deceived by the
   craft of Satan; and when made thus miserable they are to be pitied. But
   the Prophet shews here that the people were wholly undeserving of
   pardon. How so? Because there was no fear of God in them. "You cannot,"
   he says, "object and say, that you have been deceived, or make any
   pretense by which you may cover your wickedness: it is evident that you
   have acted shamelessly and basely in forsaking thy God, for there was
   no fear of God in you. [47] He subjoins at last, saith Jehovah of
   hosts: by which words the Prophet secures more authority to what he had
   announced; for what he had said must have been very bitter to the
   people: and many of them, no doubt, according to their usual manner,
   shook their heads; for we know how insolent were most of them. Hence
   the Prophet here openly declares, that he was not the author of what he
   had said, but only the proclaimer; that it proceeded from God, and that
   he had spoken nothing but what God himself had commanded.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [45] Blarney renders it "adversity." That the word sometimes means
   that, is true, but most commonly wickedness; and this is the sense
   required by the context: it must be that which corresponds in character
   with the word that follows -- apostasy, or turning aside. "Wickedness"
   is the meaning sanctioned by all the early versions, as well as modern.
   -- Ed.

   [46] The word is singular in all the early versions. It is rendered
   "apostasy -- apostasia," by the Septuagint, and, "turning aside --
   aversio," by the Vulgate Though there is no MS. in favor of the
   singular, yet the verb connected with it is in that number. The true
   reading no doubt is according to the versions, confirmed as it is by
   the number of the verb. -- Ed

   [47] The verse literally is as follows, -- 19. Chastise thee shall thy
   wickedness, And thy apostasy, it shall correct thee; Know then and see,
   That evil and bitter shall be Thy forsaking of Jehovah thy God; And my
   fear is not in thee, Saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts. The future is
   spoken of. They were warned; they were to know and see, or consider,
   that the forsaking of God, "the apostasy," would be afflictive and
   bitter: and then the cause of the "wickedness" first mentioned is
   stated, no "fear" of God. How "wickedness" was to chastise them, and
   "apostasy" to correct them, is signified, -- they would turn out to be
   "evil" -- afflictive -- hurtful, and "bitter" -- grievous -- painfully
   distressing. Hence Grotfius's exposition cannot be right --"Thy
   wickedness shall be a proof that thou art justly punished." The
   reference is to the very evils and miseries to which their "wickedness"
   and "apostasy" would inevitably lead them. Their foreign alliances were
   eventually the means of their degradation and misery; and in seeking
   them, they forsook God as their protector; and by adopting idols, they
   forsook him as the object of their worship. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast hitherto shewn to us so many
   favors, since the time thou hast been pleased to adopt us as thy
   people, -- O grant, that we may not forget so great a kindness, nor be
   led away by the allurements of Satan, nor seek for ourselves
   inventions, which may at length turn to our ruin; but that we may
   continue fixed in our obedience to thee, and daily call on thee, and
   drink of the fullness of thy bounty, and at the same time strive to
   serve thee from the heart, and to glorify thy name, and thus to prove
   that we are wholly devoted to thee, according to the great obligations
   under which thou hast laid us, when it had pleased thee to adopt us in
   thine only -- begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 2:20

   20. For of old time I have broken thy yoke, and burst thy bands; and
   thou saidst, I will not transgress; when upon every high hill and under
   every green tree thou wanderest, playing the harlot.

   20. Quia a seculo confregi, [48] jugum tuum, disrupi vincula tua; et
   dixisti, Non serviam (vel, non transgrediar, est enim duplex lectio;)
   quia super omnem collem excelsum, et super omnem arborem frondosam tu
   discurristi meretrix.


   As there are two readings in Hebrew, two meanings are given; for some
   think the verb to be, vd obed, and others, vr ober, the two letters
   being very similar. If we read, "I will not pass over," or, I will not
   transgress, the sense is, "When I broke thy yoke;" that is, "When I
   delivered thee from the tyranny of Egypt, then thou didst pledge thy
   faith to me." The covenant then made between God and the Israelites was
   mutual; for as God received them under his protection, when he became,
   as it were, their patron, so they, on the other hand, promised to
   submit to his authority. If we take this reading, the passage is an
   expostulation; as though God condemned here the people, for their
   ingratitude and perfidy. But the Prophet seems to mean another thing;
   and therefore I prefer the other reading, "I will not serve:" and yet I
   reject what interpreters have alleged; for this passage, I have no
   doubt, has been perverted. The prevailing exposition has been this, "I
   will not serve idols;" and they who seemed endued with some judgment
   did not see that this sense is unsuitable, and strained, or too far --
   fetched: and it may have been, and it seems to me probable, that for
   this reason the letter has been changed; for all gave this explanation,
   "Thou hast said, I will not serve idols:" but it is wholly a strained
   comment.

   Now, on the contrary, I think that God here complains that the liberty
   which he had given to his people was turned into licentiousness: and
   this view is exactly suitable, as it is evident from the context, --
   For from old time have I broken thy yoke and burst thy bonds: therefore
   thou hast said, (the v here is an illative,) I will not serve; that is,
   "When thou oughtest to have devoted thyself to me, who had become thy
   Redeemer, thou thoughtest that liberty to do thine own will was granted
   thee." And then the proof given of this is in every way appropriate,
   for on every high hill, and under every shady tree, didst thou run here
   and there like a harlot Then God shews that his redemption had been ill
   bestowed on the ungodly, who made a bad use of their privilege; for
   hence it was that they gave themselves up to all kinds of
   lasciviousness.

   If any one prefers the other reading, I will not contend with him; and
   then the sense is, "I have long ago shaken off thy yoke, and burst thy
   bands; and thou hast said, (he speaks of the people as of a woman, for
   the feminine gender is used; and this is done, because God sustained
   the character of a husband towards that people; and whenever he accused
   them of defection, it was as though a husband charged an unchaste wife
   with the crime of adultery,) thou hast then said to me, that is,
   promised to me that thou wouldest not transgress;" or, in other words,
   "thou hast promised to be faithful to me, and pledged mutual chastity."
   Then the particle, ky, ki, which is commonly a causative, is to be
   taken here, according to its meaning in some other parts of Scripture,
   as an adversative, Yet on every high hill and under every shady tree,
   thou didst run here and there like harlots, who are seeking lovers.

   But as I have already said, it seems to me more probable that God is
   here expostulating with the people, because they availed themselves of
   the favor of liberty as an occasion for licentiousness and wantonness:
   and thus the whole passage reads well, and every clause is most
   suitable, consistent the one with the other.

   What God says, that he had broken the yoke and burst the bands, is
   confined by some to their first redemption: but I approve of what
   others say, -- that the Prophet speaks here of many deliverances. We
   indeed know that the people were brought out of Egypt but once; but
   when they were afterwards oppressed, he stretched forth his hand to
   deliver them: God then had from old time, but at various periods,
   shaken off the yoke of the people; for this is evident from the book of
   Judges. As, then, the people were not made free, except through God's
   kindness, who redeemed them, ought they not to have devoted themselves
   to the service of their Redeemer? For on this condition, and for this
   end, they were redeemed by God, -- that they might consecrate
   themselves wholly to him. God then now condemns the people for their
   ingratitude, because they thought that the yoke was shaken off, that
   they might be, as we shall hereafter find, like untamable wild beasts.

   That what the Prophet means may be more evident to us, let us remember
   what Paul teaches us in the sixth chapter of his Epistle to the Romans
   (Romans 6), -- that while we serve sin we are free from righteousness;
   for we go astray after our lusts, and are restrained by no bridle: but
   when God really sets us free from the miserable bondage of sin, we
   begin to be his servants, and the servants of righteousness; for being
   freed from sin we become the servants of righteousness: and this is the
   end of our redemption. But many turn the favor of God into an occasion
   for licentiousness, and thus abandon themselves, as though there was no
   law and no rule for a holy and upright life. God complains that this
   was the case with the people of Israel: Thou hast said, I will not
   serve "It is base ingratitude, that thou hast not in the first place
   regarded me as thy Redeemer; and that in the second place thou hast not
   considered that I dealt so kindly with thee for this very purpose --
   that thou mightest be mine: for he who has been redeemed by another's
   kindness is no longer his own." God had redeemed that people; and
   redemption brought with it an obligation, by which the people were
   bound willingly to submit to God as their Ruler and King. Thou hast
   then said, I will not serve Thus God complains that his favor had been
   ill bestowed on the people, because they had abused their liberty, and
   turned it into lasciviousness. [49]

   And the reason that is subjoined more fully explains the meaning, for
   thou didst run here and there as a harlot, on every high hill and under
   every shady tree For we know that the Israelites, whenever they
   departed from God, had some particular places, on hills and under
   trees, as though greater sanctity were there than anywhere else. And at
   this day the case is the same with the Papists; for the devotion, or
   rather the diabolical madness, by which they are carried away, is of a
   similar kind. "O! this place, they say, "is more favorable to devotion
   than another; there is in it more sanctity." Of the same opinion were
   the Israelites: for they thought that they were nearer heaven when they
   went up to a mountain; they also thought that they had a more familiar
   intercourse with God when concealed under shady trees. And we see that
   the same folly has ever bewitched all heathen nations: for they
   imagined that God was nigher them on hills, and thought that there was
   some hidden divinity in fountains and under the shades of trees. As,
   then, this superstition had long prevailed among the Israelites, God
   here reproves them, because they ran here and there

   But we must further notice the comparison: he says, that they were like
   harlots, who, having cast off all shame, run here and there, not only
   because they burn with insane lust, but are also carried away by their
   own avariciousness. Thou, harlot, he says, didst run here and there on
   all the high hills, and under all the shady trees; as though he had
   said, "This is what I have effected in delivering thee! thou thinkest
   that unbridled liberty has been granted thee! Hence, then, it is that
   thou art become so wanton as to follow thy base lusts." It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [48] On the authority of the Septuagint and of the Vulgate, Blarney has
   rendered this verb and the following in the second person, "thou hast
   broken," etc. There is no MS. that has this reading except one, and
   that as to the first verb only. The Targum and the Syriac retain the
   first person; but the Arabic the second. There is no necessity of a
   change, as Blarney intimates, arising from the usus loquendi; see
   Jeremiah 28:2; Isaiah 9:4. Jerome followed the Septuagint; but all
   modern versions have adopted the Hebrew text. Horsley gives this
   version, -- 20. Verily of old time I broke thy yoke, I burst thy bands
   asunder; Yet thou saidst, I will not obey: Verily, upon every high
   hill, And under every green tree, Thou layest thyself along, playing
   the strumpet. Blarney having proposed to amend the last line, the
   Bishop justly says, "The text wants no correction." The verb tsh found
   only here, and in Jeremiah 48:12, and in Isaiah 51:14; Isaiah 63:1,
   means, according to Buxtorff and Leigh, to wander, to ramble, to travel
   up and down, and in a transitive sense, to cause to travel, or to
   migrate; but, according to Parkhurst, to stretch out, to lie along, and
   transitively to cause to be stretched out, that is, to throw down. The
   first meaning is more suitable to the passages referred to above. It is
   here a participle, preceded by a pronoun, "thou," the way in which a
   present act is commonly expressed in Hebrew. The line may then be thus
   rendered, -- Thou ramblest, playing the strumpet. The Targum gives the
   meaning, though not the right tense, "Thou didst worship idols." -- Ed.

   [49] The received Text has vd, to serve, and the Keri, vr, to
   transgress. In favor of the latter there are about 30 MSS., while the
   rest of those examined by Kennicott (in all 198, 71 examined
   throughout, and 127 on particular parts) retain the former verb, and
   also all the early versions, the Septuagint, the Syriac, the Arabic,
   and the Vulgate The Targum only has the latter. Piscator, Jun and Trem
   , Capellus, Blarney, and Horsley decide with Calvin in favor of the
   former; while Munster and Gataker side with our version and that of
   Geneva, in which the latter has been adopted. Clearly the former has
   the weight of authority: and the contrast, too, is striking, "I have
   broken thy bonds of slavery; but thou hast refused to serve or obey
   me." The former part of this verse is of the same purport with Jeremiah
   2:6, and the latter with Jeremiah 2:25. The verse begins with ky,
   rendered "for" in our version, by Calvin, and many others, but "surely"
   by Blarney, and "verily" by Horsley It is omitted in the Vulgate. Were
   it rendered "though," the meaning would be more evident, -- Though from
   old time I had broken thy yoke, I had burst thy bands asunder; Yet thou
   hast said, "I will not obey:" For on every high hill and under every
   green tree Thou ramblest, playing the strumpet. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:21

   21. Yet I had planted thee a noble vine, wholly a right seed: how then
   art thou turned into the degenerate plant of a strange vine unto me?

   21. Et ego plantavi to vineam electam (vineam nobilem, vel, exquisitam,
   hoc enim significat nomen, svrq,) totam fidele semen (hoc est, semen
   probum); et quomodo conversa es mihi degenerationes vitis alienae?


   God here confirms what is said in the last verse; for he condemned the
   Israelites for having perversely run here and there after their
   superstitions, when yet they had been redeemed for this end, -- that
   they might be ruled by the hand of God. Hence he says, I planted thee
   as a choice vine; that is, "When I redeemed thee from thine enemies, I
   did not give thee permission thus to prostitute thyself without any
   restraint, without any shame; for I planted thee as a choice vine."

   The metaphor is well known, and often occurs; for God frequently
   compares his Church to a vine. He calls it generally his heritage, or
   his land; but as vines excel other possessions, (for they are usually
   preferred to pasture lands, or to cultivated fields,) as then vines are
   the most valuable property, God hereby testifies how highly he values
   his Church; for he calls it his vine rather than his pasture or his
   field, when he speaks of it. So he does in this place, "I did not
   deliver thee from Egypt, that I might afterwards throw aside every care
   of thee; but my purpose was, that thou shouldest strike roots, and
   become an heritage precious to me, as an exquisite and a noble vine. I,
   therefore, planted thee a generous vine, svrq shurek, that thou
   mightest bring me forth fruit."

   Then he says, a wholly right seed; [50] that is, "I planted thee for
   this end, -- that thou mightest produce fruit acceptable and pleasant
   to me." God regards here his own grace, and not the character of the
   people; for that people, as it is well known, was never a true seed:
   but God here shews the purpose for which he had redeemed the people,
   which was, that they might be like a choice vine. How then? he adds.
   God speaks here of their corruptions with wonder, for the indignity was
   such as was enough to astonish all men: how then art thou turned to me
   into degenerations! So I render svrvm surim, though the word is not in
   common use in Latin: but it is enough for me if we understand the
   meaning of the Prophet. The word is derived from svr sur, to turn
   aside, or back. We ought to say then correctly, "into turnings aside."
   But as this would be obscure, when the vine is spoken of, I have not
   hesitated to fix on another word: How then art thou turned to me into
   the degenerations of a strange vine! Some give this version, "into
   useless branches of grapes:" but I know not whence they have taken the
   words. I wish to keep to what is more genuine, -- that the vine, which
   ought to have been fruitful, had so degenerated that it produced
   nothing, as we shall find in another place, but wild grapes. [51] And
   he calls them the turnings aside of a strange vine, which ceases to be
   the choice vine, svrq, shurek, and is turned to a wild vine, which
   produces nothing but sour or bitter fruit: and in the last place, as it
   brought forth nothing useful, God justly calls it a strange vine. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [50] The word means not only the seed of vegetables, but whatever forms
   that from which anything grows. It is applied as a verb to the planting
   of shoots or cuttings in Isaiah 17:10. The proper rendering here would
   be, -- The whole of it a genuine plant (or shoot). What is rendered
   "choice vine," svrq is the yellow vine; the best was so called, because
   it produced wine of that color. -- Ed

   [51] Much difference exists as to the literal meaning of this clause,
   though the general meaning is quite evident. None of the early versions
   are the same. The word svry is rendered, "into bitterness -- eis
   pikrian," by the Septuagint; "thou hast rebelled," by the Syriac; "into
   what is corrupt -- in pravurn," by the Vulgate; "thou hast declined
   from my fear," by the Targum Blarney takes it as a verb in the
   imperative mood, and renders the two lines thus, -- Yet how I find thee
   changed! Depart, O vine of spurious growth. But there is a harshness
   and incongruity in this version that renders it inadmissible. Besides
   "vine of spurious growth" is not the meaning of the words used, for it
   is "a foreign vine," that is, a heathen vine; which contains an
   allusion to the idolatry which had been imported from heathen nations.
   It is most probable that svry, or in full, svrym, means degenerate
   shoots or branches, as Parkhurst thinks. To turn aside, to decline, to
   degenerate, seems to be the most common meaning of the verb. There
   would in this case be a congruity in the whole verse, -- And I myself
   had planted thee a choice vine, The whole of it a genuine plant; How
   then art thou become to me The degenerate shoots of a foreign vine? The
   plant was of the best kind, but the shoots or the branches had become
   degenerated, such as a foreign or heathen vine produced. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:22

   22. For though thou wash thee with nitre, and take thee much soap, yet
   thine iniquity is marked before me, saith the Lord GOD.

   22. Etiam si lveris to nitro (ut vertunt,) et multiplicaveris tibi
   borith (alii exponunt, herbam fullonum; alii, saponem; quod ad rei
   summam spectat, nulla est ambiguitas, quoniam intelligit Deus nullo
   artificio, nullis herbis posse maculas populi purgari,) impressa est
   (vel, insculpta est, vel, signata, ut alii vertunt) iniquitas tua coram
   facie mea, dicit Dominus Jehova.


   We have already seen, and the Prophet will often repeat the same thing,
   -- that the people were become so refractory that they would not
   willingly give way to any reproofs; for they were almost all of such a
   hard front, and so obdurate in their wickedness, that they dared
   insolently to raise objections against the prophets; whenever they
   severely reproved them: "What! Are not we God's holy people? Has he not
   chosen us? Are we not the holy seed of Abraham?" It was therefore
   necessary for the prophets to apply a hard wedge to a hard knot, as
   they commonly say. As, then, the Israelites were like a knotty wood, it
   was necessary to strike hard their obstinacy.

   On this account Jeremiah now says, Even if thou wert to wash thyself
   with nitre, and multiply to thee borith, yet thine iniquity would be
   before me marked; that is, "Ye effect nothing when ye set forth various
   pretences for the sake of excusing your impiety: wash yourselves, but
   your iniquity remains marked before me." The Prophet speaks in the
   person of God, that he might add more weight to the denunciation he
   pronounced on the Israelites, and by which he reduced to nothing their
   self -- flatteries, according to what has been already stated.

   By nitre and borith they removed stains in cloth; and hence borith is
   often mentioned in connection with fullers. But there is no need of a
   laborious inquiry, whether it was an herb or dust, or something of that
   kind; for as to what is meant, it is generally agreed that the Prophet
   teaches us by this metaphor, -- that hypocrites gain nothing by setting
   up their pretences, that they may escape, when God condemns them. Hence
   he says, that all their attempts would be vain and fruitless. How so?
   Because their iniquity remained unwashed; that is, because they could
   not remove by washing what is imprinted. Spots or stains can indeed be
   cleansed or washed away by soap or other things; but when the stain is
   inward, and imprinted within, washing will avail nothing, for the marks
   are so deep that some more efficacious remedy must be adopted. So now
   the Prophet says, that the stains were imprinted, and therefore could
   not be washed away or cleansed by soap or borith. [52]

   But the Prophet says, that the stains were marked, or stamped, before
   God; for it was a common thing with the Israelites to clear themselves
   from every blame; nay, so great was their audacity, that they openly
   opposed the prophets, as though some great wrong was done to them; and
   they called the prophets accusers and slanderers, Hence he says, Thine
   iniquity is stamped before me? [53] that is, "However thou mayest by
   self -- flatteries deceive thyself, and hidest thy sins before the
   world, yet thou gainest nothing; for in my sight thine iniquity ever
   remains stamped." He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [52] What we call "nitre" is different from the "nitron" here
   mentioned. The verb, from which the noun is derived, means to loosen,
   to set free: and hence the article called nitron dissolves in water,
   and loosens and washes away spots and stains. Borith was an herb,
   which, being burnt, and its ashes dissolved in water, had a strong
   cleansing power. -- Ed.

   [53] The verb rendered "stamped" is only found here in Niphel, but, as
   a participial noun, it seems to mean gold stamped or marked to shew its
   genuineness. See Psalm 45:9; Proverbs 25:12. A stain or spot is not
   what it signifies, as given by the Septuagint and the Vulgate, nor
   "blot," according to Blarney; but it refers to the stamp or mark
   imprinted on a hard metal, such as gold: and this idea alone
   corresponds with the other parts of the verse. A stain, a spot, or a
   blot, might be cleansed by abstergents, but not a mark stamped on a
   metal, -- But thou washest thyself with nitron, And multipliest for
   thyself fuller's ashes: Stamped is thine iniquity before me, Saith the
   Lord Jehovah. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:23

   23. How canst thou say, I am not polluted, I have not gone after
   Baalim? see thy way in the valley, know what thou hast done: thou art a
   swift dromedary traversing her ways;

   23. Quomodo dices (hoc est, quomodo dicis; nam futurum tempus saepe
   accipitur apud Hebraeos pro acu continuo, quomodo igitur dicis) non sum
   polluta, post Baalim non profecta sum? Vide vias tuas in valle,
   cognosce quid feceris dromedaria velox corripiens vias suas (vel,
   circumiens, nam deducitur vox ista a corrigia calceamenti).


   Jeremiah goes on here with his reproof, and dissipates the clouds of
   hypocrites, under which they thought themselves to be sufficiently
   concealed: for hypocrites, when they allege their fallacious pretences,
   think themselves already hidden from the eyes of God and from the
   judgment of all men. Hence the Prophet here sharply condemns this
   supine self -- security, and says, How darest thou to boast that thou
   art not polluted? How darest thou to say, that thou hast not walked
   after Baalim? that is, after strange gods. I have already said, that by
   this word were meant inferior gods: for though the Jews acknowledged
   one Supreme Being, yet they sought for themselves patrons; and hence
   arose, as it is usual, a great number of gods. The superstitious never
   lapsed into that degree of impiety and madness, but that they ever
   confessed that there is some supreme Deity; but they added some
   inferior gods. And thus they had their Baalim and patrons, like the
   Papists, who call their patrons saints, for they dare not in their
   delusions to call them gods. Such was the sophistry of the Jews.

   How then, he says, canst thou excuse thyself, and say, that thou hast
   not walked after Baalim? See, he adds, thy ways, see what thou hast
   done in the valley, and know at length that thou hast been like a swift
   dromedary The Prophet could not have fully expressed the furious
   passions which then raged in the Jews without comparing them to
   dromedaries: and as he addresses the people in the feminine gender, the
   female dromedary is mentioned. I consider that she is called swift, not
   only on account of the celerity of her course, but on account of her
   impetuous lust, as we shall presently see.

   Now this passage teaches us, that the people had become so hardened,
   that they insolently rejected all reproofs given them by the prophets.
   Their impiety was openly manifest, and yet they ever dared to allege
   excuses, for the purpose of shewing that the prophets unjustly
   condemned them. Nor are we to wonder that such contumacy prevailed in
   that ancient people, since at this day we find that the Papists, with
   no less perverseness, resist the clear light of truth. For however
   gross and shameful their idolatry appears, they yet think that they
   evade the charge by merely saying, that their statues and images are
   not idols, and that the people of Israel were, indeed, condemned for
   inventing statues for themselves, but that they did this, because they
   were prone to superstition. Hence they cry against us, and say, that
   the worship which prevails among them is unjustly calumniated. We see,
   and even children know, that under the Papacy every kind of
   superstition prevails; and yet they seek to appear innocent, and free
   from every blame. The same was the case formerly: and as the temple
   continued, and the people offered sacrifices there, and as some kind of
   religion remained, whenever the prophets reproved the impious
   corruptions, which were blended with and vitiated the pure worship of
   God, and which were called adulteries, as they everywhere declare,
   "What!" they said, "Do we not worship God?" This very perverseness is
   what the Prophet now condemns by saying, How darest thou to say, I am
   not polluted, I have not walked after Baalim? So the Papists say at
   this day, "Do we not believe in one God? Have we devised for ourselves
   various gods? Yet they rob God of all his power, and dishonor him in a
   thousand ways: and at the same time they assert against us, with a
   meretricious mouth and an iron front, that they worship the one true
   God. [54] The case was exactly the same with the Jews: but the Prophet
   here proves their boasting to be vain and grossly false, See, he says,
   thy ways in the valley; see what thou, a swift dromedary, hast done As
   they could not be overcome by reasons, their willfulness being so
   great, the Prophet compares them to wild animals: "Ye are," he says,
   "like lascivious dromedaries, which are so carried away by lust, that
   they forget everything while pursuing their own courses." It follows --

     __________________________________________________________________

   [54] "The Jews, it seems," says Loath, "had found out distinctions,
   whereby to reconcile the worship of the true God with those religious
   rites which they paid to the deities of the heathen, called here
   Baalim. These, they pretended, were only inferior demons or spirits, or
   the souls of men departed, and might be worshipped in subordination to
   the supreme God." Scott adds to this quotation this just remark, "This,
   and nothing better, can the Papists urge in excuse of their manifest
   idolatry in worshipping saints and angels" -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:24

   24. A wild ass used to the wilderness, that snuffeth up the wind at her
   pleasure; in her occasion who can turn her away? all they that seek her
   will not weary themselves; in her month they shall find her.

   24. Onager (sed adhuc retinet foemineum genus, foemina igitur onagri)
   assueta deserto, in appetitu animae sum (hoc est, pro desiderio, vel,
   cupidine animae suae colligens ventura occasionis suae (vel, occursus
   sui) quis inde reducet eam? Quisquis persequitur earn non fatigabitur,
   in mense suo inveniet eam.


   As Jeremiah had called the people a dromedary, so he now calls them a
   wild ass: "Thou," he says, "art both a dromedary and a wild ass." For
   when a wild ass has caught the wind according to her desire, that is,
   when she has pantingly sought it, and has caught the wind of her
   occasion, that is, such as may chance to be; for he meant to shew, by
   this expression, that there is no choice made by beasts, no judgment
   shewn, no moderation exercised; -- when, therefore, she has caught the
   wind, wherever chance may take her, no one can restrain her from her
   impetuous course; and he who pursues her will in vain fatigue himself,
   until he finds her in her month

   By these words the Prophet intimates the untamable madness of the
   people, that they could not by any means be restrained, being like a
   wild ass, which cannot be tamed nor divested of its wildness,
   especially when she has caught the wind. For were she shut in, bolts
   might do something, so as to prevent her headlong course: but when a
   wild ass is free, and allowed to ramble over hill and dale, when she
   catches the wind, and catches it according to her desire; that is, when
   she can wander here and there, and nothing prevents her from rambling
   in all directions, -- when such a liberty is allowed to wild animals
   that they catch the wind, and the wind of occasion; that is, any wind
   that may chance to be, there is no reason, as the Prophet seems to
   intimate, in wild beasts, nor do they keep within any due bounds. When
   any one of us undertakes a journey, he inquires how far he can go in
   one day, he avoids weariness, and provides against it as far as he can,
   and after having fixed the extent of his journey, he thinks of a
   resting -- place; and he also makes inquiries as to the right way, and
   the best road. The case is different with wild animals; for when they
   begin to run, they go not to Lyons or to Lausanne, but abandon
   themselves to a blind impulse: and then when they are fatigued, they
   cease not to proceed in their course, for lust hurries them on. We now
   perceive the design of the Prophet.

   He then adds, Who can bring her back? As though he had said, that the
   people could not be stopped or brought back to anything like
   moderation, for a wildness, yea rather a complete madness, had taken an
   entire possession of them. [55]

   It afterwards follows, There is no reason for any one to weary himself,
   he will at length find her in her month All interpreters agree that
   this month is to be taken for the time of foaling. When the wild asses
   are in foal, and the time of parturition draws nigh, they are then
   restrained by their burden, and may be easily caught, as they retain
   not their previous swiftness, for they carry a burden. The Prophet then
   says, that the people were like wild asses, for they could be
   restrained by no instruction, and nothing could bridle their excesses;
   but that the time of parturition must be waited for.

   Let us now see how this similitude applies to the people. The verse
   contains two parts. The first shews, as I have already said, that the
   people could not be turned by any warnings, nor would they obey any
   counsels, but were carried away by their insane passions, as it were by
   the wind of occasion, or any wind that might blow. This is the first
   part. Now as the obstinacy of the people was so great, God here
   declares to hypocrites, that the time would come when he would put a
   restraint on them, and break down their impetuous infatuation. How? The
   time of parturition would come; that is, "when ye shall have done many
   iniquities, your burden will stop and restrain you." And he intimates,
   that it would be the time of his judgment; as though he had said, "you
   must be dealt with not as sane men, endued with a sound mind; for ye
   are wild beasts which cannot be tamed." What, then, remains to be done?
   As the wild ass is weighed down with her burden when the time of
   parturition approaches, so I will cause you at length to feel the
   burden of your iniquities, which will be by its weight intolerable; and
   though your perverseness is untamable, yet my hand will be sufficient
   to restrain you; for I shall break you down, as ye will not bend nor
   obey my instruction." We now, then, understand the import of the
   similitude, and how applicable it was to the case of the people; the
   use of which ought to be learnt, also, by us in the present day. The
   rest tomorrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [55] The grammatical anomalies at the beginning of this verse are
   satisfactorily removed by Parkhurst, and what he has proposed is
   approved by Horsley. He considers phrh to be the female dromedary, he
   derives lmd from md, measure, or extent, with a l prefixed, and regards
   nphsh as the true reading, being that of the Keri, and of the largest
   number of MSS. This verse and the preceding are to be thus connected,
   -- 23. How canst thou say, "I have not been polluted, After Baalim have
   I not walked!" See thy way in the valley, Know what thou hast done, --
   Like a swift dromedary which winds about her courses, -- 24. A female
   which, in the wide space of the wilderness, Through the desire of her
   natural instinct, Snuffs up the wind she meets with: Who can turn her
   back? All who seek her, Let them not weary themselves; In her month
   they shall find her. By "winding about her courses," or tracks, or
   ways, is meant running in this and in that direction, and not in a
   straight course. The word, as a noun, denotes the string or latchet by
   which the ancients fastened their sandals, and which they twined round
   the feet. "The wind she meets with," is literally, "the wind of her
   meeting." The Septuagint and the early versions have departed widely
   from the original; the Vulgate comes nearest to it; nor is the Targum
   far off -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that, as it pleased thee, when thou didst deliver
   us from the tyranny of Satan, to lay on our necks thy yoke: -- O grant,
   that we may be influenced by the spirit of docility, and of obedience,
   and of meekness, and willingly submit ourselves to thee through the
   whole course of our life, so that thou mayest gather from us the fruit
   of thy redemption: and may we so renounce sin that we may devote
   ourselves to thy service, and become the servants of righteousness,
   until having finished the course of our warfare, we shall be gathered
   into that blessed rest. which has been obtained for us by the blood of
   thine only -- begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 2:25

   25. Withhold thy foot from being unshod, and thy throat from thirst:
   but thou saidst, There is no hope: no; for I have loved strangers, and
   after them will I go.

   25. Prohibe pedem tuum a discalceare (hoc est, ne discalceeris) et
   guttur tuum a siti (quanquam alii existimant esse nomen substantivum
   ychph, et mihi placet; ita vertendum erit, Prohibe pedem tuum a
   discalceatione et guttur tuum a siti;) et dixisti, Acturm est; non,
   quia dilexi alienos, et post illos ambulabo.


   The words of the Prophet, as they are concise, may appear at the first
   view obscure: but his meaning is simply this, -- that the insane people
   could by no means be reformed, however much God might try to check that
   excess by which they were led away after idols and superstitions. In
   the first clause, God relates how he had dealt with the people. All the
   addresses of the prophets had this as their object -- to make the
   people to rest contented under the protection of God. But he employs
   other words here, Keep thy foot, he says, from unshodding, and thy
   throat from thirst For whenever there was any danger they ran, now to
   Egypt, then to Assyria, as we have already seen. Hence God complains of
   their madness, because they obeyed not his wise and salutary counsels.
   Had God bidden them to run here and there, either to the east or to the
   west, they might have raised an objection, and say, that the journey
   would be irksome to them; but he only commanded them to remain still
   and quiet. How great, then, was their madness, that they would not with
   quietness wait for the help of God, but weary themselves, and that with
   no benefit? Isaiah says nearly the same thing, but in other words; for
   he expostulated with them, because they underwent every kind of
   weariness, when they might have been protected by God, and be in no way
   wearied.

   We now, then, comprehend the design of the Prophet: for God first shews
   that the people had been admonished, and that in time; but that they
   were so taken up with their own perverse counsels, that they could not
   endure the words of the prophets. It was the highest ingratitude in
   them, that they refused to remain quiet at home, but preferred to
   undergo great and severe labors without any advantage, according to
   what is said by Isaiah in another place,

   "This is your rest, but ye would not." (Isaiah 30:15.)

   There is no one who desires not rest and peace; nay, all confess that
   it is the chief good, which all naturally seek. The Prophet says now,
   that it was rejected by the people of Israel. It hence follows, that
   they were wholly insane, for they had lost a desire which is by nature
   implanted in all men. The Prophet, then, does not here simply teach,
   but reminds the Jews of what they had before heard from Isaiah, and
   also from Micah, and from all the other prophets. For God had often
   exhorted them to remain quiet; and the Prophet now upbraids them with
   ingratitude, because they gave way to their own mad folly, and rejected
   the singular benefit offered them by God.

   Let us then know that the Prophet states here what others before him
   had taught, Keep back, he says, thy foot from unshodding. Some render
   the last word, "from nakedness," because they wore out their shoes by
   long journeys; but this I think must be understood of what was commonly
   done, for they were wont to make journeys unshod: keep then thy foot
   from being unshod, [56] and thy throat from thirst We know that thirst
   is very grievous to men: hence the Prophet here reproves the madness of
   the people, -- that they were so seized with the ardor of an impious
   passion, that they willfully exposed themselves to thirst even by long
   journeys. As then God required nothing from the people but to ask his
   counsel, their sin was doubled by their unwillingness to obey his
   salutary direction. A plausible excuse, as I have already said, might
   have been alleged, had God dealt in a hard and severe manner with the
   people; but as he was ready kindly and graciously to preserve them in a
   complete state of quietness, no kind of excuse remained for them.

   It then follows, Thou hast said, There is not a hope, no The Prophet
   shews here, as to the people, how perverse they were; for they
   obstinately rejected the kind and friendly admonitions which had been
   given them. They say first, There is not a hope, or, it is all over;
   for y's iash, in Niphal, means to despair, or, to be out of hope. It
   may be rendered, "It is weariness;" and this would not be unsuitable,
   if taken in this sense, "I have thoughtlessly tormented myself more
   than enough, so that weariness itself induces me to rest." No. The
   Prophet speaks concisely in order to express more strikingly the
   refractory conduct of the people. By saying, "There is not a hope," it
   is the same as though he had said, that they spurned all exhortations;
   and then he adds, No. There is no verb put here; but an elliptical
   expression, as I have said, is more forcible to set forth the ferocity
   of the people. [57]

   Isaiah expostulated with them in another way, and blamed them, because
   they did not say, "There is not a hope." (Isaiah 57:10.) Thus Isaiah
   and Jeremiah seem to be inconsistent; for our Prophet here reproves the
   people for saying, "There is not a hope;" and Isaiah, for not having
   said so. But when the Jews expressly answered, according to this
   passage, "There is not a hope," they meant that the prophets spent
   their labor in vain, as they were determined to follow their own course
   to the last. Hence by this expression, "There is not a hope," is set
   forth the extreme perverseness of the people; and he shews that no hope
   of repentance remained, since they said openly and without any evasion
   that it was all over. But Isaiah reproved the people for not saying,
   that there was not a hope, because they did not acknowledge after long
   experience that they were proved guilty of folly: for after having
   often run to Egypt and then to Assyria, and the Lord having really
   taught them how ill-advised they had been, they ought to have learnt
   from their very disappointments, that the Lord had frustrated their
   expectations in order to lead them to repentance. Justly then does
   Isaiah say, that the people were extremely besotted, because they ever
   went on in their blind obstinacy, and never perceived that God did set
   many obstacles in their way, in order to compel them to go back and to
   cast aside all their vain hopes, by which they deceived themselves. We
   hence see that there is a complete agreement between the two prophets,
   though their mode of speaking is different.

   Jeremiah then introduces the people here as saying expressly, and thus
   avowing their own perverseness, There is not a hope; as though they
   said, "Ye prophets do not cease to stun our ears, but vain and useless
   is your labor; for we have once for all made up our minds, and we can
   never be brought to revoke our resolution." But what does Isaiah say?
   He reproves the madness of the people, that having been so often
   deceived by the Egyptians as well as by the Assyrians, they did not
   understand that they ought by such trials and experiments to have been
   brought back to the right way, but continued obstinately to follow
   their own wicked counsels. As to the passage before, we perceive what
   the Prophet means, -- that God had kindly exhorted the Jews to rest
   quiet and dependent on his aid; but that they were not only
   stiff-necked, but also insolently rejected the kindness offered to
   them.

   It then follows, For I have loved strangers, and after them will I go
   Here he exaggerates the sin of the people, for they gave themselves up
   to strangers; and he retains the similitude which we have already
   observed. For as God had taken the people under his own protection, so
   the obligation was mutual: both parties were connected together as by a
   sacred bond, as the case is between a husband and his wife; as he
   pledges his faith to her, so she by the law of marriage is bound to
   him. Jeremiah here retains this similitude, and says that the people
   were like the basest strumpet, for they would not hear the voice of
   their husband, though he was willing and anxious to be reconciled to
   them. Now, a wife must be wholly irreclaimable when she spurns her own
   husband, who is ready to receive her into favor, and to forgive her all
   the wickedness she may have done. The Prophet then shews, that there
   was in the people so great and so hopeless an impiety, that they closed
   their ears against God who kindly exhorted them to repent; and worse
   still, they shamelessly boasted that they were resolved to worship
   idols and their own fictions, and to reject the only true God. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [56] That the word means to be barefooted, or without shoes, is clear
   from Isaiah 20:2-4, and also from 2 Samuel 15:30: and it is nowhere
   else found except here. It being here a noun, it signifies literally
   barefootedness. They are here exhorted not to travel for aid to foreign
   lands, so as to wear out their shoes and thus become barefooted. This
   was said in contempt, in order to pour ridicule on their folly in
   seeking foreign aid. -- Ed.

   [57] It has been disputed whether the negative "no," refers to the
   advice given at the beginning of the verse, or to the immediately
   preceding word. The latter is the most natural. The word nv's is a
   participle, as in Job 6:26. The verse may be thus rendered, -- 25. Keep
   thy foot from being bare And thy throat from thirst; But thou hast
   said, "Hopeless! No; For I have loved strangers, And after them will I
   go." The first part implies that they were pursuing a useless course.
   The insolent answer was, "Is it hopeless? By no means." The Septuagint
   omit the negative, and have only "andrioumai -- I will act manfully;"
   and this version has been followed by the Syriac and Arabic The Vulgate
   has, "desperavi, nequaquam faciam -- I have despaired, I will by no
   means do so." The most literal rendering is given above, and affords
   the best and the most suitable meaning. To confess that it was a
   hopeless thing to attempt to reform them, is not so appropriate, as to
   deny it to be hopeless to have recourse to foreign alliances: which
   seems to be the import of the passage. This is the view which Gataker
   seemed most inclined to take; and he mentions this rendering, "Should I
   despair? No." To the same purpose is the version of Jun. and Trem. But
   Grotius, Henry, and Adam Clarke, agree with the explanation of Calvin.
   -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 2:26

   26. As the thief is ashamed when he is found, so is the house of Israel
   ashamed; they, their kings, their princes, and their priests, and their
   prophets,

   26. Sicut pudor (vel, probrum) furi, cum deprehensus est, ita pudefacti
   sunt domus Israel, reges eorum, principes eorum, et sacerdotes eorum et
   prophetae eorum.


   Some render the words in the future tense, "So ashamed shall be the
   house of Israel," etc.; and they think that the Prophet is speaking
   here of the punishment which was impending over the people: but I
   explain the words as they are, -- that the impiety of the people was so
   gross, that there was no need formally to prove it, as it was so very
   palpable. Hence the Prophet compares the Jews to open thieves, as
   though he had said, that hypocrites among that people gained nothing by
   their evasions and subterfuges, for their impiety was quite public:
   they were like a thief when caught, who cannot deny nor hide his crime.
   Hence he says that they were caught, as they say, in the very act; that
   is, their flagitious deeds were so conspicuous, that whatever
   objections they might raise, they could not clear themselves, but their
   baseness was known to all. We now then perceive what the Prophet means.
   We have before seen that the people had recourse to many excuses, but
   Jeremiah shews here, that they attained nothing by their evasions,
   except that they more fully discovered their own effrontery, for their
   dishonesty was evident to all; it was so manifest that they could not
   cover it by any cloaks and pretences. [58]

   Nor does he speak only of the common people; but he condemns kings,
   princes, priests, and prophets, as though he had said, that they were
   become so corrupt from the least to the greatest, that having cast off
   all shame, they openly shewed a manifest and gross contempt for God by
   following their own inventions and superstitions. And yet the Jews no
   doubt attempted by many excuses to defend themselves; but God here
   shakes off all those fallacious pretexts, by which they thought to
   cover their flagitious deeds, and says that they were notwithstanding
   manifestly thieves.

   The Prophet had said before, that the Jews made a different
   declaration; and now he condemns their effrontery: but there is no
   inconsistency as to the meaning. The Jews denied that they were
   apostates and guilty of perfidy, or that they had forsaken the worship
   of God; they denied this in words; but the Prophet, in now proclaiming
   their shamelessness, does not refer to words; for they had ready at
   hand their false pretensions, as it has been already stated: but the
   Prophet now takes the fact itself as granted, and says that they
   wickedly and perversely resisted God, so that their wickedness and
   obstinacy were past all remedy. It now follows --

     __________________________________________________________________

   [58] The verb rendered "is ashamed," is in the past tense in Huphal,
   and means "made ashamed," or, "confounded," as rendered, by the Targum
   and the Vulgate. The Septuagint have converted it into the future
   tense, and so have the Syriac and the Arabic, which have been followed
   by most modern versions, and by commentators. If we rightly view the
   whole passage, we shall see reason to take this verb as we find it, in
   the past tense. The verse is an answer, as it were, to what is
   contained in the latter part of the previous verse, by a reference to
   what had already taken place as to the people of Judah; and the 30th
   verse (Jeremiah 2:30) countenances the past tense. This and the
   following verse may be thus rendered, -- 26. As a thief is ashamed when
   he is found out, So made ashamed have been the house of Israel, They,
   their kings, their princes, Their priests and their prophets; 27. Who
   have said to the wood, "My father art thou," And to the stone, "Thou
   hast begotten me." Though they have turned to me the back and not the
   face; Yet in the time of their calamity, They say, "Arise and save us."
   The participles in Hebrew are regulated as to their tense by the verbs
   in the passage. Hence 'mrym in Jeremiah 2:27, is to be in the same
   tense with the previous verb. The future in the last line is to be in
   the present, as it expresses what was commonly done. Then what was
   usually said to them is mentioned in the following verse, -- 28. But
   where are thy gods, which thou hast made for thyself? Let them arise,
   if they can save thee In the time of thy calamity: For according to the
   number of thy cities Have been thy gods, O Judah. Blayney has kept to
   the past tense as to the last line, and also as to the beginning of
   Jeremiah 2:26. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 2:27-28

   27. Saying to a stock, Thou art my father; and to a stone, Thou hast
   brought me forth: for they have turned their back unto me, and not
   their face: but in the time of their trouble they will say, Arise, and
   save us.

   27. Dicentes ligno, Pater meus tu (hoc est, tu es pater meus,) et
   lapidi, Tu genuisti me (si legamuss per y, si autem per v, Tu genuisti
   nos;) quia verterunt mihi cervicem (dorsum, alii vertunt, vel,
   posteriora,) et non faciem: in tempore autem calamitatis suae dicent
   (hoc est, dicunt,) Surge et serva nos.

   28. But where are thy gods that thou hast made thee? let them arise, if
   they can save thee in the time of thy trouble: for according to the
   number of thy cities are thy gods, O Judah.

   28. Et ubi sunt dii tui, quos fecisti tibi? Surgant, an servent to
   tempore mali tui (hoc est, afflictionis tuae, sicuti prius;) quia
   secundum numerum urbium tuarum fuerunt dii tui, Jehudah.


   The Prophet here confirms what he had before said of the perverse
   wickedness of the people. He shews that he had not said without reason,
   that their sins were extremely gross, and could not be excused by any
   evasions: for they say, he adds, to the wood, Thou art my father, and
   to the stone, Thou hast begotten, me By these words the Prophet shews,
   that idolatry was so rampant among the people, that they openly
   ascribed to their statues, made of wood or stone, the honor due to the
   only true God.

   But the Prophet points out here what is especially to be detested in
   idolatry, and that is, the transferring of the honor, due to God, to
   statues, not only as to the external act by bending the knee before
   them, but by seeking salvation from them.

   And this is what we ought particularly to notice: for the Papists at
   this day, though they prostrate themselves before their pictures and
   statues, do not yet acknowledge themselves guilty of idolatry, when
   such a charge is brought against them. They say that they worship the
   statues, not with the honor due to God, but with such honor as a
   servant renders to his master. [59] They think that they thus exculpate
   themselves. But were we to grant what they allege, they yet cannot deny
   but that they address prayers and supplications to statues. As then
   they ask the very statues to save them, whatever sophistry they may
   adopt, it is altogether nugatory: for the prophets condemn not merely
   the outward gesture, the bowing down, and other ceremonious acts, as
   they are called, when they condemned idolaters. What then? They
   condemned them, because they said to statues, Thou art my Father; that
   is, because they ascribed the power, which belongs only to God, to
   statues made of wood or stone. It is indeed certain, that the Jews
   never sunk into so great a depth of sottishness as expressly to profess
   that gods of wood and stone were equal to the true God, and they never
   said any such thing. Yet the Prophet did not calumniate them, in
   ascribing what is here said to them: but as it is clearly evident from
   other places, the Prophet regarded their thoughts rather than their
   words: for the Jews professed the same thing as the Papists of the
   present day, when they prostrated themselves before their statues; they
   said that they worshipped the only true God and sought salvation from
   him; and yet they thought that the power of God was inherent in the
   statues themselves: hence they said, Thou art my father, Thou hast
   begotten me The case is the same with the Papists of the present day.
   When any one prostrates himself before the statue of Catherine or of
   Christopher, he says, "Our Father." When he justifies himself in doing
   this, he says that it is done in honor to the one true God: and yet
   thou runnest blindly, now to one statue, and then to another, and
   muttcrest, "Our Father." There is not the least doubt but that the
   superstition which now prevails under the Papacy, is even more gross
   than that which prevailed among the Jews. But to say nothing of the
   Papists, because they mutter, "Our Father," before their statues, there
   is no doubt but that when they present their prayers to statues, they
   consider God's power to be in them.

   We must now, then, bear in mind, that the Jews were not only condemned,
   because they burnt incense and offered sacrifices to idols, but because
   they transferred the glory of God to their statues, when they asked
   salvation from them. And as this was not done in express words, the
   Prophet here brings to light their impious thoughts; for they did not
   raise up their minds and thoughts to God, but turned them to their
   statues.

   It afterwards follows, They have turned to me the neck [60] and not the
   face In these words, God again confirms what he had before said, that
   the apostasy or defection of the people was more manifest than what
   could be disguised by any colorings. He then adds, Yet (the v is to be
   taken here adversatively) in the time of their affliction, they will
   say, Arise, and save us God here complains that the Jews most strangely
   abused his kindness; for they came to him when any grievous calamity
   constrained them. "What have I to do with you?" he says, "Ye are wholly
   devoted to your idols, ye call them your fathers, and ascribe to them
   the glory of your salvation, when things go on peaceably with you; but
   when your idols in time of distress give you no aid, then ye return to
   me and say, Arise, and save us; but, since idols are your fathers, and
   ye expect salvation from them, I shall have nothing to do with you; be
   contented with your idols, and trouble me no more, for I have been
   forsaken by you."

   And hence he adds, Where are your gods? Here God laughs to scorn the
   false confidence by which the Jews deceived themselves: Where are your
   gods, which you have made for yourselves? Let them arise, let us see
   whether they will help you in the time of your distress. We now
   understand what the Prophet means: for he shews that the people acted
   in a most strange manner; for they worshipped idols when they were in
   safety, and afterwards would have God to be bound to them; and yet they
   denied the true God when they fell away unto idols. He then shews that
   they could expect no aid from God; for they robbed him of his own power
   when they devised idols for themselves. But we must ever remember what
   he said, that false gods were counted as fathers and authors of
   salvation by the people.

   The same thing is, no doubt, done at this day under the Papacy; for the
   Papists have their patrons; and when they find that their foolish
   superstitions can do nothing for them, they would have God to help
   them, and yet they leave nothing to him: after having taken away all
   his glory, and divided it as a spoil among dead saints, they would then
   have God to be their helper. But we see what God's answer to them is,
   "Where are your gods?" etc.

   Now this truth is of use to us; and we hence learn, that we are not to
   wait until we are really, and in the last state of despair, compelled
   to acknowledge that our labors have been useless, while we hoped and
   prayed for help from idols; but that we ought to come directly to God
   himself for aid in our distress.

   God proceeds farther with the sarcasm or the derision which he has
   employed, Where are thy gods? Let them now arise that they may help
   thee; that is, -- let them try their utmost whether they can aid thee.
   According to the number of thy cities have been thy gods, O Judah As
   the people were not satisfied with one God, every city chose a patron
   for itself. "Since, then, innumerable gods are invoked by you, how
   comes it that they do not help you?" We hence see that the unbelief of
   the people is here sharply reproved; for they did not acquiesce in God
   alone, but sought to procure for themselves gods without number: there
   were many cities in the tribe of Judah, and there were as many patrons.
   The one true God would have been fully sufficient for them, and would
   have brought them complete deliverance whenever needed; but the one
   true God they despised, and every city devised a god for itself. "Since
   ye trust," he says, "in such a multitude, let them now arise, that they
   may succor you; for I, who am one, am despised by you." We now
   understand what the Prophet means also in this part. It afterwards
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [59] The words employed by Calvin are the technical terms, latria and
   dulia, the fictions of the Papists. The first means specifically
   worship, and the second, service, obedience. The verb douleuo in the
   New Testament is never used in the sense of worshipping or adoring, but
   of serving and obeying: but to bow to images or to kiss them, is an act
   of adoration, and not of service. -- Ed

   [60] The "neck" here means evidently the hinder part, for it is in
   contrast with "face;" and the word generally means the hinder part.
   Hence it is properly rendered here "back" in our version and by
   Blayney, and so by the Targum and the early versions, except the
   Syriac, which retains the hinder part of the neck. We have no single
   word, except it be nape, which denotes the back part of the neck. There
   is one in Welsh, "gwegil," and so in Latin, "cervix," and in Greek,
   auchen But the Septuagint have adopted here "nota -- backs." -- Ed

   Jeremiah 2:29

   29. Wherefore will ye plead with me? ye all have transgressed against
   me, saith the LORD.

   29. Cur litigatis mecum omnes impie agentes in me (vel, perfide)? dicit
   Jehova.


   Jeremiah concludes here his previous subject: he says that the Jews
   gained nothing by alleging against God that they were innocent, and by
   thinking that they could by mere words escape his judgment, and not
   only by doing so, but also by hurrying on to such a degree of
   presumption as to challenge God himself, and to seek to prove him
   guilty. But God answers them in one word, and says, that they were
   perfidious. The meaning then is, that the Jews ill consulted their own
   interest in hardening themselves in their obduracy; for God would hold
   them fully convicted of impiety, so that they in vain alleged this or
   that as an excuse. [61]

   Now this passage deserves especial notice: for we know how prone we are
   by nature to hypocrisy; and when God summons us to his tribunal, hardly
   one in a hundred will acknowledge his guilt and humbly pray for
   forgiveness; but the greater part complains, nay almost all murmur
   against God, and still more, they gather boldness, and proudly dare to
   challenge and defy God. Since, then, hypocrisy thus prevails in us and
   is deeply fixed in the hearts of almost all, and since hypocrisy
   generates insolence and pride against God, let us remember what the
   Prophet says here, -- that all who dispute against God gain nothing by
   their excuses, because he will at length detect their defection and
   perfidy. It then follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [61] The verb rendered "plead" in our version, is followed by 'l,
   against or in opposition to. There are two other instances, Judges
   21:22; Job 33:13. Our version in Job is, "Why dost thou strive against
   him?" The most suitable rendering of this passage is, Why should ye
   contend against (or, with) me? Then follows a fact sufficient to put an
   end to all contention, -- All of you have rebelled against me, Saith
   Jehovah. The primary idea of phs is, to go, to pass, to march on. See
   Isaiah 28:4. Its meaning depends on the preposition which follows it.
   Followed by l, over, it means to transgress, it being a going or
   passing over the limits set by the law, Hosea 8:1, -- by m, to go from,
   to revolt, to apostatize, 2 Kings 8:22,-and by v, to go against, to
   rebel, as in this passage. Hence the noun has attained various
   meanings-transgression, apostasy, and rebellion. Its precise meaning in
   any case is to be determined by the context. Gataker and Blayhey render
   the verb here the same, -- All of you have rebelled against me, saith
   Jehovah. The early versions vary. The Septuagint have "esebesate -- ye
   have acted impiously," the Syriac, "ye have denied me," -- the Arabic,
   "ye have sinned against me,"-and the Vulgate, "ye have forsaken me."
   The general idea is the same, but the specific one is that of rebelling
   against God. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 2:30

   30. In vain have I smitten your children; they received no correction:
   your own sword hath devoured your prophets, like a destroying lion.

   30. Frustra (vel, in vanum) castigavi filios tuos, correctionem non
   receperunt; voravit gladius vester prophetas vestros quasi leo
   vastator.


   Some expound the beginning of this verse as though the meaning were, --
   that God chastised the Jews on account of their folly, because they
   habituated themselves to falsehoods: but the latter clause does not
   correspond. There is therefore no doubt but that God here expostulates
   with the Jews, because he had tried to bring them to the right way and
   found them wholly irreclaimable. A similar expostulation is found in
   Isaiah,

   "In vain," he says, "have I chastised you; for from the sole of the
   foot to the crown of the head there is no soundness."
   (Isaiah 1:6)

   There God shews that he had tried every remedy, but that the Jews,
   being wholly refractory in their spirit, were wholly incurable.
   Jeremiah speaks now on the same subject: and God thus exaggerates the
   wickedness of the people; for he testifies that he had tried whether
   they would be taught, not only by words, but also by scourges and
   chastisements, but that his labor in both instances had been in vain.
   He spoke before of teaching, "Keep thy foot from being unshod, and thy
   throat from thirst." The Prophets, then, had exhorted the Jews by God's
   command to rest quietly. This teaching had been useless and unfruitful.
   God now adds, that he had tried in another way to bring them back to a
   right mind; but this effort had been also useless and in vain: In vain
   have I chastised you; for ye have not received correction

   But he speaks of children, in order to shew that the whole people were
   unteachable: for though lusts boil more in youth, yet their obduracy is
   not so great as in the old; as he who has through his whole life
   hardened himself in the contempt of God, can hardly be ever healed and
   be amended by correction; for old age is of itself morose and difficult
   to be pleased, and the old also think, that wrong is in a manner done
   them when they are reproved: but when the insolence and obduracy of the
   young are so great that they reject all correction, it is more strange
   and monstrous. The Prophet then shews that there was nothing sound or
   right in that people, since their very children refused correction.
   [62]

   We now perceive his object, -- that, as God had sent his prophets, and
   as their labor availed nothing, he now shews, that not only the ears of
   the people had been deaf to wholesome teaching, but that they were hard
   -- necked and untamable; for he had tried to correct them by scourges,
   but effected nothing. It follows, their sword has devoured the prophets
   But I cannot finish now.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [62] Blayney renders the word "instruction." The Septuagint have
   "paideian -- discipline: "the Syriac, Vulgate, and the Targum are the
   same; but the Arabic has "instruction -- eruditionem." The strict
   meaning of the word mvsr, is restraint, check, discipline, correction.
   Not to receive restraint or correction, is not to be thereby improved
   or reformed, but to proceed in the same course, see Jeremiah 5:3. The
   word has also a secondary meaning, instruction, as the effect of
   correction, see Zephaniah 3:7. But here it clearly means correction. --
   Ed

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou, in thy paternal kindness, daily
   invitest us to thyself, we may not harden ourselves against thy holy
   and salutary admonitions: and whenever thou chastisest us with
   scourges, may we not become obdurate against thee, but learn humbly to
   submit to thy word, and receive thy chastisement, and so profit by
   both, that we may not be exposed to the extreme judgment which thou
   denouncest on the obstinate; but may we, on the contrary, open a way
   for thy paternal goodness, so that thou mayest kindly deal with us,
   until thou receivest us into that blessed rest which has been prepared
   for us in heaven, through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture Ninth

   IN yesterday's lecture, God complained that he had spent labor in vain
   in chastising the children of Israel; for they were of a nature utterly
   untamable and refractory, incapable of being improved. Hence he says,
   "I have in vain endeavored by punishments to bring you back to the
   right way." But he now exaggerates their crime of obduracy, as they not
   only had rejected wholesome instruction, but had also shed innocent
   blood, and persecuted as their enemies the prophets who had been sent
   to them from above, in order to promote their wellbeing. God then
   condemns them here not only for perverseness, but also for cruelty; for
   he says, that he had not gained his object in leading them to
   repentance, and also, that they had not only been refractory and
   incorrigible, but that they had besides cruelly raged against the
   prophets: and Jerusalem, we know, had been a slaughter -- house where
   many of the prophets had been killed.

   Some explain the passage of false teachers, as though the Prophet had
   said, that it was to be ascribed to the wickedness of the people, that
   prophets, who were false and mendacious, suffered just punishment; and
   they lay hold on one word, even because they are called their prophets.
   Hence Jerome says, that they were said to be your, and not my prophets;
   as though God thus denied that he had given them any commission. But
   this view is forced and strained.

   We must, then, understand the meaning to be what I have stated, -- that
   when God used means to heal the vices of the people, the very prophets,
   the ministers of salvation, were cruelly slain by the people. And this
   exposition best suits the expressions which follow, as a devouring lion
   For God says, that the Jews raged against the prophets, as though they
   had entered a forest full of lions. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 2:31

   31. O generation, see ye the word of the LORD. Have I been a wilderness
   unto Israel? a land of darkness? wherefore say my people, We are lords;
   we will come no more unto thee?

   31. Generatio, vos vidite verbum Jehovae, an deserturn fui Israel? an
   terra caliginis? Quare dixerunt populus meus (hoc est, dixit, sed
   plurali utitur, quia est nomen collectivum) dominati sumus (alii,
   recessimus,) non veniemus amplius ad to.


   The prophet assumes the character, no doubt, of one in astonishment,
   that he might render the sin of the people more detestable: for he
   speaks as one astonished, generation! The word, dvr, dur; as it is well
   known, means an age. It is then the same as if he had said, "On what
   time are we fallen? or in what an age do we now live?" We now then
   perceive the import of the word. Then he adds, See ye the word of
   Jehovah The word, see, seems not to be suitable; for he ought to have
   said, "Attend to, "or "hear." But he bids them to see, and most
   appropriate is the term; for he does not require the people to hear,
   but, on the contrary, to know, as though he had said, "See ye
   yourselves what this is which the Lord declares." And he emphatically
   says, 'tm atem, "ye yourselves." For the Jews might have been
   deservedly condemned by all nations, were they brought into judgment.
   But the Prophet shews, that however blind they were, they might see
   with their own eyes what the Lord now says. He does not refer to
   instruction, but to a fact, as though he had said, "The Lord by me
   expostulates with you; and though there should not be present any
   witnesses or a judge or an umpire, ye yourselves are able to understand
   and know the whole matter." We hence see how fitly the Prophet speaks,
   when he bids them to see the word of Jehovah [63]

   For he immediately adds, Have I been a desert to Israel? He makes the
   Jews themselves the umpires and judges of the cause, whether they had
   not experienced the bounty of God and had forsaken him, according to
   his former complaint, when he said that God was the fountain of living
   waters, and that they had dug for themselves broken cisterns. Hence he
   says, "How has it happened that ye have departed from me? Have I in
   vain promised to be bountiful and kind to you? Did I disappoint you or
   your expectation, while ye served me? Since then I had not been to you
   a dark and a gloomy land, a land without the light of the sun; but as
   abundance of blessings had ever been found in me, how has it been that
   you have departed from me?"

   He afterwards mentions another crime, Why has my people said, We are
   lords The verb rdnv, redenu, is variously explained by interpreters.
   Some derive it from ydr, ired, to descend, and think that the y, iod,
   is supplied by a point. But these differ in their views: some refer to
   the calamities with which the Jews had been visited, and others to
   their apostasy. The first give this explanation, "We have descended;"
   that is, "We have been oppressed with calamities, what then can we gain
   by calling on God, since our affairs are in so hopeless a state?" The
   second draw forth another meaning, "We have gone back;" that is, "There
   is no reason for the prophets to stun our ears by their clamors, for we
   have once for all resolved never to return to God; we have wholly
   renounced him; away with him, let him begone together with his
   exhortations, for we will not attend to them." Both these expounders
   think it to be the language of despair: but we perceive how they
   differ; the first apply "descend" to the calamities of the people, and
   the second to their perfidy, because they had bidden adieu, as it were,
   to God, and wished not to have any farther intercourse with him.

   But there are others who take the word more grammatically: for rdh,
   rede, and rvd, rud, signifies to be lord, or to rule. I therefore
   prefer the view of those who render the word, We are lords Some take
   the verb in a passive sense, but I know not for what reason: and the
   comment of others is very diluted, "We have kings and counselors." I
   consider it to be the language of pride and of vain boasting: for the
   Jews thought themselves to be kings, according to what Paul says of the
   Corinthians,

   "Ye are rich, ye have reigned without us, and I would ye did reign." (1
   Corinthians 4:8.)

   The Corinthians, being inflated with pride on account of the opulence
   of their city, despised the simplicity of the Gospel; they looked for
   refined things, and were much addicted to novelties. Hence Paul, seeing
   that they despised the grace of God, ironically reproved them, and
   said, that they wished to be rich and to be kings without him, to whom
   yet as an instrument they owed everything. The same vice is what
   Jeremiah now condemns in that people, We are lords, we will not come to
   thee; as though he had said, "Your happiness has hitherto proceeded
   from me; for whatever you have been, and whatever has been given you,
   ought to be ascribed to me and to my bounty: but now without me (for
   God himself speaks) ye are kings, but by what right and by what title?
   What have you as your own? Why then has my people said, We will come no
   more to thee?" We now understand the real meaning of the Prophet.

   As to the subject itself, he in the first place, as I have already
   said, is in a manner astonished at the wickedness of the people, as at
   something monstrous. Hence he exclaims, O generation! as though he had
   said, that what he saw was incredible. Then he immediately adds, see ye
   yourselves the word of Jehovah, This was much more severe, than if he
   had summoned them before God's tribunal; for he thus proved that their
   wickedness was extremely gross; for they had, without any cause, nay,
   without any pretext, and without shame, renounced God, who had been so
   bountiful towards them. He also in an indirect manner reproved them,
   because they refused to be instructed; for he commanded them to look on
   the fact itself, inasmuch as they were deaf, or having ears they closed
   them against all instruction; for, as we have said, he calls away their
   attention from the word to the fact itself, and this is what
   interpreters have not observed.

   Then follows an upbraiding, -- that God had not been a desert to them;
   but, as the Prophet had before shewed, abundance of all blessings had
   flowed to them so as fully to satisfy them. Since then God had enriched
   them through his blessing, their sin in departing from him was thereby
   more increased.

   In the last part of the verse God expostulates with them on their
   ingratitude, because they thought themselves to be lords. They were
   indeed a royal priesthood, but it was through God's favor. They did not
   reign through their own right, they did not reign because they had
   attained power through their own valor or efforts, or through their own
   merits or their own good fortune; how then? only through the favor of
   another. Though then they were kings only on the condition of being
   subject to the supreme King, yet they wished to reign alone, that is,
   according to their own pleasure; and thus trod under their feet the
   favor of God. It is with this wickedness then that the Prophet charges
   them. And the end of the verse is of the same import, we will come no
   more to thee; as though they stood in no need of God's aid; for they
   thought that they could supply themselves with whatever was necessary
   to support them. As then they were inflated with much pride, they
   despised the favor of God, as though they stood in no need of the aid
   of another. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [63] The beginning of this verse literally is "The age, ye," that is,
   "Ye of this age," or generation. He was speaking before more especially
   of the preceding age. He now appeals to the people of that generation,
   -- Ye of this age, see, spoken hath Jehovah, -- Have I been a
   wilderness to Israel, Or a land of darkness? Why have they said, even
   my people, "We have ruled, we will no more come to thee?" The above
   rendering of the latter part of the first line is favored by the
   Septuagint, "Hear ye the word of the Lord; thus saith the Lord." The
   Arabic is the same. The Vulgate has, "See the word of the Lord," -- and
   the Syriac, "Hear the word of the Lord." Blayney renders thus, "Behold
   ye the cause of Jehovah." Gataker takes "see" in the sense of
   considering, "See," or seriously consider, "the word of the Lord." The
   particle 'm after h, may be rendered "or," as in the Syriac See Joshua
   5:13. The word m'phlyh is found in two MSS., m'phylh, which seems to be
   the true reading, countenanced by the Targum, and all the early
   versions, except the Vulgate, which has "serotina -- lateward."
   Darkness is a common metaphor for wretchedness and misery "We have
   ruled" is the literal rendering of rdnv, and there is no other reading.
   The Septuagint gives the same meaning, though the form is different,
   "We shall not be lorded over -- ou kurieuthesometha." The Arabic is the
   same. It is the language of proud independence. The Targum, the
   Vulgate, and the Syriac have mistaken the verb for yrdnv, which means,
   to descend, to come down, to bring down. Blayney gives the correct
   idea, "We are our own masters, "which Horsley approves. The preterite
   in Hebrew often includes the present; so the full meaning is, "We have
   ruled and do rule." -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 2:32

   32. Can a maid forget her ornaments, or a bride her attire? yet my
   people have forgotten me days without number.

   32. An obliviscetur puella ornamenti sui? Sponsa ligaminum suorum (ad
   verbum; alii vertunt, murenulas; alii, torques; sed nomen hoc deducitur
   a qsr, quod est ligare; apud nos possemus vertere tressures proprie?)
   populus autem meus (nam vau debet resolvi in adversativam particulam)
   oblitus est mei diebus innumeris (quibus non est numerus, ad verbum )


   God here confirms what is said in the last verse, and would make his
   people ashamed, because they valued him less than girls are wont to
   value their ornaments. The necklaces of young women are indeed nothing
   but mere trifles, and yet we see that girls are so taken with them
   through a foolish passion, that they value such trinkets more than
   their very life. "How then is it, "says God, "that my people have
   forgotten me? Is there to be found any such ornament? Can anything be
   found among the most valuable jewels and the most precious stones which
   can be compared with me?"

   God shews by this comparison how perverted the minds of the Jews were,
   when they renounced and rejected a benefit so invaluable as to have God
   as their Father, and to be prosperous under his dominion; for nothing
   necessary for a blessed life had been wanting to them as long as they
   continued the recipients of that paternal favor, which God had
   manifested towards them, and wished to shew to them to the end. As then
   they had found God to have been so bountiful, must they not have been
   more than mad, when they willfully rejected his favor? while yet young
   women commonly set their thoughts and affections strongly and
   permanently on such trifles as are of no value. [64] But the Prophet
   designedly used this similitude, that he might introduce what is
   contained in the next verse: his object was to compare the Jews to
   adulterous women, who being led away by unbridled lust, follow wanton
   lovers. As then he intended to bring this charge against the Jews, he
   spoke expressly of the ornaments of young women; and hence it follows
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [64] The second word, klh, is rendered "sponsa -- a bride," in our
   version, by Calvin and Blayney, and so by the Vulgate, Syriac, and the
   Targum, but by the Septuagint, "parthenos -- a virgin:" and Parkhurst
   says that it never means a bride. The version then ought to be, -- Can
   a maid forget her ornaments,
   A virgin her bands? That the word qsrym means bands of some kind is
   evident, as the verb signifies to bind, to join closely. Bands or
   bandage for the breast -- stethodesmida, is the version of the
   Septuagint; the Arabic and the Vulgate are the same. Parkhurst
   considers that "head-bands" are meant. The word is found also in Isaiah
   3:20; where the Septuagint render it "daktuliois-rings," and the
   Targum, "murenulas -- chains," which were of gold, and worn around the
   neck. For any practical purpose it is only necessary to know that they
   were embellishments which young women delighted in: and women in every
   age are too fond of such things, and men too; but the case is
   introduced here only for the sake of illustration. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 2:33

   33. Why trimmest thou thy way to seek love? therefore hast thou also
   taught the wicked ones thy ways.

   33. Cur bonificas (id est, paras, concinnas) vias tuas ad quaerendum
   amorem? itaque etiam pravitates docuisti in viis tuis.


   This verse is differently explained: but the Prophet simply means; that
   the Jews were like lascivious women, who not only despise their
   husbands at home, but ramble here and there in all directions, and also
   paint their faces and seek for themselves all the charms of wantonness.
   He says that the Jews had acted in this way; and hence he says that
   they made beautiful their ways The verb in Hebrew has a wide meaning:
   it means to prepare, to conciliate favor. But its import here is, as
   though the Prophet had said, "Why dost thou disguise and paint thyself
   like strumpets, who use many artifices to allure young men and to
   inflame their lusts? why then dost thou undertake so much labor to gain
   a meretricious hire?" We shall hereafter see why he says this; for he
   upbraids them for applying to the Assyrians and the Egyptians.

   It was a common thing with the Prophets to compare the people to
   lovers; for the Jews, while they ought to have been firmly attached to
   God, (like a chaste woman, who does not turn her eyes here and there,
   nor gad about, but has respect to her husband alone,) thought to seek
   safety now from the Assyrians, then from the Egyptians. This sinful
   disposition is then what the Prophet here condemns; and hence he speaks
   of them metaphorically as of an adulterous woman, who despises her
   husband and rambles after any she can find, and seeks wanton and silly
   young men in all places, and subjects herself to the gratification of
   all. We now then understand what the Prophet means.

   The words must be noticed: he says, Why makest thou fine thy ways? But
   he refers here to the care which a wanton woman takes to adorn her
   person, as though he had said, "Why dost thou thus prepare thyself? and
   why dost thou seek for thyself what is splendid and elegant, that thy
   appearance may deceive the eyes of the simple?" For the Jews might have
   remained safe and secure under God's protection, and might have been so
   without any calamity. As a husband is content with the beauty of his
   wife, and seeks no adventitious and refined elegancies; so God required
   nothing from that people except fidelity, like a husband, who requires
   chastity in his wife. The meaning then is, -- "As a wife, really
   attached to her husband, has no need to undergo much labor, for she
   knows that her own native beauty pleases him, nor does she labor much
   to gain the heart of her husband, for the best recommendation is her
   chastity; so ye might have lived without any trouble by only serving me
   and keeping my law: but now what is your chastity? ye are like wanton
   women, who labor to gain the hearts of adulterers; for as they burn
   with lust, so there is no end nor limits to their attempts to seek
   embellishments; and they torment themselves, only that they might
   attach adulterers to themselves. Such then are ye (says God;) for ye
   spend much care and labor in seeking for yourselves strange lovers."

   He afterwards adds, Therefore thou hast also taught lewdnesses He
   alludes to the words he had before used, Thou hast made fine (or fair)
   thy ways: and now he says, thou hast also taught wickednesses by thy
   ways He declares that the Jews were worse than the Assyrians and the
   Egyptians, as a lascivious woman is far worse than all the adulterers
   whom she captivates as her paramours. For when a young man is not
   deceived, and the devil does not apply the fagot, he may continue
   chaste and pure; but when an impudent and wanton woman entices him, it
   is all over with him. The Prophet then says, that the Assyrians and the
   Egyptians were innocent when compared with his own nation. How so?
   "Because they have been led away," he says, "by your allurements, like
   young men, who are destroyed by the fallacious ornaments of strumpets;
   for it is the same as though they had fallen into snares: the evil then
   has proceeded from you, and the fault lies with you. [65]

   We now understand the Prophet's meaning: for he condemns the Jews,
   because they afforded an occasion of evil both to the Assyrians and to
   the Egyptians, while they of their own accord sought their favor. It
   now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [65] The exposition of this verse is no doubt materially correct. The
   words have been variously rendered, On the first clause there is a
   general agreement, The verb "taught" in the second, is in the first
   person in the received text; and to this reading Blayney gives the
   preference, and thus renders the line, -- Therefore also have I taught
   calamities thy ways. That is, "that God had directed calamities where
   to find them." But this is rather a remote idea. In favor of the second
   person, "thou hast taught," are several MSS., all the early versions
   and the Targum; and it is what has been by most adopted. "The wicked
   ones" of our version is a rendering not countenanced by any of the
   ancient versions, nor by the Targum; all render it evil or evils or
   wickednesses. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:34

   34. Also in thy skirts is found the blood of the souls of the poor
   innocents: I have not found it by secret search, but upon all these.

   34. Etiam in alis tuis repertus est sanguis animarum pauperum
   innocentum; non in suffossione repertae erant, sed super omnibus his
   (alii vertunt quia in onmibus illis; et particula est causalis, sed
   tamen hic adversative debet resolvi, quemadmodum multis locis.)


   The Prophet repeats, as I think, what he had before said, -- that the
   wickedness of his nation was incorrigible; for they repented not when
   warned, but on the contrary raged like wild beasts against the Prophets
   and religious teachers. Those interpreters are mistaken who think that
   the savage cruelty of the Jews in general is here condemned; and all
   are of this opinion. But the Prophet no doubt enhances this evil, by
   saying, that the Jews were not only obstinate in their vices, but also
   raged furiously against the Prophets. Hence he shews again, that God
   had used all remedies to heal the Jews, but without effect, for what
   better medicine could have been offered than for the Prophets to
   reprove the people and to shew to them how wickedly they had departed
   from God? God then wished thus to correct the vices of his own people;
   but so far was he from effecting anything, that at Jerusalem and
   through the whole of Judea, the Prophets were slaughtered, and the
   whole land was filled with and polluted by their blood.

   Hence he says, Even in thy wings has been found the blood of the souls
   of the poor innocents. He calls the borders of garments wings. He seems
   to say, that these slaughters were not hid, for the Jews were
   besprinkled with blood to the very extremities of their garment; as
   though he had said, "There is no cause for me to deal sharply with you
   in this instance; for your filthiness is most apparent: ye have not
   only been rebellious against my teaching, but ye have also cruelly
   murdered my prophets. If ye ask, Where these slaughters are to be
   found? Even in your wings, on the borders of your garments; so that
   your crimes are fully known." We now perceive what the Prophet means.

   We must also notice the import of the particle gm, gam, also, or even.
   Their cruelty was worse and more nefarious, because they thus rose up
   against their own physicians; for the prophets, as it has been said,
   were the ministers of their safety. As then they thus raged against
   God's favor so as to murder his prophets, it became still more evident,
   that they were utterly irreclaimable.

   He afterwards adds what serves for a confirmation. They have not been
   found in digging under Some give another explanation; but their opinion
   is right who think, that the Prophet alludes to what is said by Moses
   in Exodus 22:2, -- that if a thief should be found in digging under,
   (or undermining,) he might be killed with impunity: for he who thus
   breaks through into the houses of others, is equal to a robber in
   audacity; and he ought to be counted not only a thief, but also as one
   guilty of manslaughter and felony. God then says, that the Prophets,
   who had been slain by the Jews, had not been found in digging up, that
   is, had not been found guilty of any crime, either of robbery or of
   murder: for he mentions a particular act, instead of the general crime.
   But it has been on account of all these things; that is, "because they
   boldly dared to reprove you, because they severely condemned your
   vices, because they discovered your baseness, because they were enemies
   to your perfidy and to your sins: as then the prophets had thus by the
   divine Spirit carried on war with your sins, they have on this account
   been murdered by you. [66]

   We see how well the whole passage reads, provided it be applied to the
   prophets only. It was not indeed the object of Jeremiah to condemn
   murders generally among the Jews, but to shew that they were the
   enemies of the prophets, because they were opposed to every good and
   sound counsel, and were incapable of receiving instruction. The mistake
   of other expounders is hereby made evident: for in the last clause they
   touch neither heaven nor earth. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [66] Our version of this text seems on the whole the best. "Blood," dm,
   is to be taken here in a collective sense, as the verb to which it
   belongs is plural. Instead of "poor innocents, "it ought rather to be
   "the innocent poor," as the noun in Hebrew generally precedes its
   adjective. "Found" is in the first person, and there is no different
   reading, and it is so in the Septuagint, and the Vulgate, though the
   Syriac and Arabic give the second person, and the Targum the third
   person plural, as Calvin does. The last word is rendered "these" in the
   Vulgate and the Targum; but "oak" in the Septuagint, the Syriac, and
   the Arabic, and adopted by Blayney, but disapproved by Houbigant and
   Horsley As to the word, rendered in our version, "secret search," the
   early versions have pit, pits, or ditches, and so the Targum Blayney
   renders it "a digged hole," of which Horsley approves; and he refers,
   as an illustration, to Leviticus 17:13, and to Ezekiel 24:7. The word
   means digging, and seems to be used here metaphorically for searching;
   there is no need of adding "secret" to it, -- Also in thy skirts has
   been found
   The blood of the souls of the innocent poor:
   Not by searching have I found it,
   But upon all these (i.e., skirts.) The reference is to what is said in
   Jeremiah 2:30, where the Jews are charged with the killing the
   prophets. As to "the blood, "we find a similar passage in Ezekiel 24:7,
   8. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:35

   35. Yet thou sayest, Because I am innocent, surely his anger shall turn
   from me. Behold, I will plead with thee, because thou sayest, I have
   not sinned.

   35. Et dixisti (hoc est, dixisti tamen; nam copula hic accipitur pro
   tamen,) certe (nam ky causalis particula hic audaciam notat, vel illam
   jactantiam plenam impudentiae, ut auderent asserere Iudaei se esse
   innoxios, certe) ego sum munda (ego sum innocens;) tantum recedat furor
   ejus a me: Ecce ego judico to (vel, contendam tecum in judicio,) quia
   dixisti, non peccavi.


   The Prophet here shews that the Jews were possessed of such a brazen
   front, that they could not be led by any admonitions to feel any shame.
   Though then they were like adulterous women, and though they gave
   meretricious hire to such as they ran to in all parts, and though also
   they had murdered the prophets and the pious ministers of God, yet they
   boasted, as persons conscious of no evil, that they were innocent.

   Thou hast yet said; that is, "How darest thou to pretend to be
   innocent, since thou art proved to be guilty, not by allegations, but
   by manifest and glaring proofs?" In short, the Prophet shews that the
   condition of the people was past remedy, for they would not receive any
   admonition; nay, they dared, as it were with the front of brass,
   obstinately to boast that they were innocent: Thou hast said, (he still
   speaks of a woman, in the feminine gender,) Thou hast yet said, surely
   I am clean Thus hypocrites not only excuse themselves, and allege vain
   pretences, but dare to come forth publicly, and to fly as it were above
   the clouds, elated by their own self -- confidence. "Who will dare to
   allege anything against me?" Thus hypocrites willfully and
   impertinently challenge all the servants of God and seek by their own
   presumption to close the mouth of all. The Prophet now condemns this
   petulancy in the Jews; for though they were manifestly proved guilty,
   yet they boastingly asserted that they were innocent. Only ('k, ak, I
   take here to mean only) depart, etc. The Prophet upbraids the Jews with
   another crime, -- that they said, that wrong was done to them by God in
   seeking to bring them to a right mind by punishment and by reproofs.
   For God, as it is well known, had inflicted many punishments on the
   Jews, and had also added serious reproofs. He tried by these means to
   find out whether they were capable of being healed. What did they say?
   "I am innocent; and God is angry with me without a cause. Let him
   remove his anger from me;" that is, "only let not God deal severely
   with us, nor use his supreme authority, and we shall be able to prove
   our innocency." Thus ungodly men, when urged with severe warnings,
   vomit forth their blasphemies against God, -- "O what can I do? I know
   that I am not able to resist; God fights with a shadow when he afflicts
   me; his violence I must indeed bear though he may overwhelm me; yet he
   doeth me wrong: but were he to deal justly and fairly with me, I could
   prove that I do not deserve these evils." Such then was the language of
   the Jews, -- only depart let his fury from me, we could then shew that
   we are just, or at least excusable.

   Now also in this part we perceive the design of the Prophet: it was to
   shew, that the Jews not only dared dishonestly and proudly to claim
   innocency for themselves, but hesitated not to contend with God, and to
   intimate that he with too much severity oppressed them, and did not
   treat them justly, but announced a cruel sentence for the purpose of
   overwhelming them.

   Behold, he says, I will judge thee, because thou hast said, I have not
   sinned Some give this version, "I judge, or, condemn thee." But there
   is here no doubt a contrast between the fury of God and his judgment.
   The people said, that God was too rigorous; this was his fury: God now
   mentions his judgment. "There is no reason," he says, "for you to
   allege such a pretext as this, as it will vanish into nothing; for I
   will in judgment contend with you;" that is, "I will really prove that
   I am a just judge and not a tyrant, that I execute just punishments and
   according to the law, and that I am not like a man in anger, who takes
   vengeance on his enemies and does so precipitantly and rashly: I will
   shew," he says, "that I am a just judge."

   We may hence gather a profitable instruction. Let it in the first place
   be observed, that nothing is so displeasing to God as this headstrong
   presumption, that is, when we seek to appear innocent, while our own
   conscience condemns us. Then in the second place observe, that all who
   thus perversely rebel and strive dishonestly and shamelessly to defend
   their own vices, contend at the same time with God: for false excuses
   have ever this tendency -- to charge God with unjust severity. But we
   see what such men gain for themselves; for God shews that he will be at
   length their judge, and that he will openly discover the vices of those
   who thought that they could excuse themselves by evasions and by false
   charges against himself. They then who thus obstinately resist God,
   must at length, according to what the Prophet declares, come to this
   end, -- that they will be constrained to acknowledge that God has not
   been too violently angry with them, but has only executed a just
   punishment. [67]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [67] The literal rendering of this verse is as follows: -- 35. And thou
   hast said, "Verily I have been innocent; Surely turned away has he his
   anger from me:" Behold I will contend in judgment with thee, On account
   of thy saying, "I have not sinned." The Septuagint have rendered the
   second line, "Let his anger be turned away from me;" the Vulgate and
   the Arabic are the same. The Syriac is, "therefore he turns away his
   anger from me." "Turned away is his anger," is the Targum, Piscator,
   Jun. and Trem. Blayney renders it, -- Surely his wrath shall turn from
   me. There is no reason for construing the verb in the future tense, or
   in the imperative mood. It is in the past tense, and there is no other
   reading. The claim of innocency is made on the supposition that God had
   turned away his displeasure. Hence the declaration that follows -- that
   God would contest the matter -- would bring it as it were into trial,
   as the verb here when in Niphal means. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since we are loaded with so many vices, and
   provoke thee so often, yea, daily and in ways innumerable, -- O grant,
   that we may not at last become hardened against thy godly admonitions,
   but be teachable and submissive and in time repent, lest our wantonness
   and hardness should constrain thee to put forth thy powerful hand
   against us; but as we have hitherto experienced thy patental kindness,
   so may we in future be made partakers of it, and thus become more and
   more accustomed to bear thy yoke, until having at length completed our
   warfare, we shall come to that blessed rest, which has been provided
   for us in heaven, through Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 2:36

   36. Why gaddest thou about so much to change thy way? thou also shalt
   be ashamed of Egypt, as thou wast ashamed of Assyria.

   36. Quid discurris tantopere ad mutandum vias tuas? Etiam ab Egypto
   pudefies, sicuti pudefacta es ab Assur.


   The Prophet goes on with the same subject. He had said before that the
   people were like an unfaithful wife, who having left her husband
   rambles here and there to gratify her lusts. For this view he now gives
   the reason; for he might have appeared to treat the people too
   severely, had not the fact been pointed out as it were by the finger;
   and this he does now. He says, that they ran here and there, not in a
   common manner, but in a way to render evident their shameful levity,
   such as is seen in strumpets, who without any shame seek either
   adulterers or fornicators.

   But I have already briefly shewn what the Prophet means: When any
   danger was nigh, the Jews sought aid, now in Egypt, then in Assyria.
   Yet they knew that this was forbidden them; not that it was in itself
   an evil or a bad thing to seek help from neighbors; but because it was
   God's will that the safety and security of that people should be
   dependent on him only; for he had taken them under his safeguard. As
   then the Jews were God's dependents, they ought to have acquiesced in
   his protection. When they wandered here and there, it was an evidence
   of unbelief; and what they attributed to the Egyptians or to Assyrians,
   they took away from their own God, who had promised that their safety
   would be the object of his care. Hence he compares these movements to
   wanton levity; they were like those of strumpets, who ramble in all
   directions. Now a strumpet must be wholly shameless, when she thus
   seeks the gratification of her lust: for harlots often wait for the
   coming of lovers; but when they ramble everywhere, they are altogether
   abominable. This then is what the Prophet now means, that is, that the
   Jews ran here and there; and thus it was, that they changed their ways

   There remains indeed often in harlots some natural love; but it is a
   proof of a brutish, shameless, and monstrous lust, when a woman seeks
   the company of any one she may see, or when a man lusts after any woman
   he may meet with. When there is such a shamelessness as this, it
   appears that no modesty remains, nor even what is natural; for as I
   have already said, it ought to be deemed monstrous, when a woman is
   inflamed with lust at the sight of any one. And yet this lewdness is
   what the Prophet reprobates in the Jews when he says, that they ran
   here and there to change their ways: so that their love never
   continued, but they lusted after any they met with; nay, they went here
   and there to allure them. This subject is spoken of oftener and more at
   large by Ezekiel; and we shall find this comparison used also in other
   parts of this book. But it is enough for me to mention briefly the
   design of the Prophet. [68]

   He then adds, Ashamed shalt thou also be of the Egyptians, as ashamed
   thou hast been of the Assyrians Before the time of Hezekiah, the Jews
   had made a treaty with the Assyrians against the Syrians and the
   Israelites, as it is well known; and then against the Egyptians; for
   soon after a war arose between them and the Egyptians, who had been
   their confederates, and changing their policy, they went for help to
   Assyria. They afterwards reconciled themselves to their ancient
   enemies; but this second treaty also turned out unhappily. Hence the
   Prophet says, that the end would be the same with what they had before
   experienced. God had indeed chastised their ungodly defection when they
   went to Assyria. He now says, that no better success would attend the
   help of the Egyptians than what attended the help of the Assyrians. The
   Jews, we know, were ever subjected to plunder, and suffered more loss
   from their associates than from their open enemies. It was the just
   reward of their impiety and defection. God then declares that he would
   be the avenger of this second defection, as he had been of the former.
   It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [68] The idea of gadding, or of running here and there, is not
   countenanced by any of the early versions. The notion of vileness or
   degradation is what the versions convey. The Vulgate is, -- Quinn vilis
   factus es nimis, iterans vias tuas!
   How extremely worthless art thou become, iterating thy ways! The other
   versions are nearly of the same general import. Blayney's version is,
   -- Why wilt thou make thyself exceedingly vile, In repeating over again
   thy ways? Modern critics have considered the verb to be 'zl, and not
   zl. It no doubt may be either. As shame is threatened at the end of the
   verse, the latter verb is the most suitable, -- Why shouldest thou
   become wholly degraded By repeating thy course?
   Even by Egypt shalt thou be put to shame, As thou hast been put to
   shame by Assyria. "Course," or way, means here a proceeding, and to
   repeat it is to pursue a course similar to what had been previously
   adopted. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 2:37

   37. Yea, thou shalt go forth from him, and thine hands upon thine head:
   for the LORD hath rejected thy confidences, and thou shalt not prosper
   in them.

   37. Et jam ab hoc (ab hac re, hoc est, propter hoc scelus) egredieris,
   et manus tuae super caput tuum, quia detestatur Jehova confidentias
   tuas, et in illis non prospere tibi succedet.


   He expresses more clearly what he had said of the shameful character of
   his own nation, -- that the Jews, who thought that their safety would
   be secured by the Egyptians, were seeking their own entire ruin. This
   seemed to them indeed incredible; for as the Egyptians were neighbors,
   and as the Jews then only feared the Assyrians and Chaldeans, who were
   afar off, they thought that they had the best prospect: "What! our
   enemies are distant from us twenty or thirty days' journey; and those
   who are prepared to help us will be soon with us at the shortest
   warning." Hence the Jews thought, as we have said, that they were quite
   safe. But the Prophet here declares, that they were greatly mistaken;
   for on account of this wickedness, that is, because they trusted in
   their unlawful and accursed treaty, and promised themselves peace from
   their enemies, or thought that they could easily overcome them; on this
   account, he says, thou shalt go forth: but nothing could have been less
   credible to the Jews than what the Prophet said; for as the Egyptians
   opposed themselves as a wall against the Chaldeans, and were deemed
   unassailable, who could have otherwise thought but that the Jews would
   be preserved quiet in their own country? But he says, Go forth shalt
   thou, and thine hands on thy head [69]

   By this gesture he means extreme despair; for women did either strike
   or extend their arms when any great calamity happened, as we see it
   done often in the present day; for when a woman, not able to keep
   within due bounds, either loses a husband, or expects some very great
   calamity, she beats her breast, or raises up her hands, according to
   what is said here. Jeremiah then mentions this gesture as an evidence
   of extreme despair; as though he had said, "The treaty which fills the
   Jews with so much confidence shall be so far from being advantageous to
   them, that it will, on the contrary, bring on them utter ruin and
   disgrace. [70] But the reason which follows ought especially to be
   observed, because abhor does Jehovah thy confidences The Prophet here
   shews why he had spoken so severely. It might have appeared that he
   spoke hyperbolically when he said, that the people were like an
   abandoned harlot, who rambled here and there in all directions: but the
   reason here given ought to have been sufficient to take away all
   evasions, and that is, that they foolishly trusted in those fallacious
   helps which they knew were condemned by God. Had this been permitted by
   God, they would not have been so severely reprimanded; but as God had
   forbidden them to flee to the Egyptians, it was in the first place a
   disallowed confidence; and in the second place, they thus despised the
   aid of God, and cast aside, as it were, all his promises: for as their
   hearts were fixed on the Egyptians, and as they thought that their
   safety would be secured by them; so their prayer to God became not only
   cold, but almost wholly extinguished.

   We hence see that the Prophet did not exceed due limits when he spoke
   against the Jews with so much displeasure, and condemned them in such
   reproachful terms; for they had transferred the glory due to God to the
   Egyptians, when they considered them to be the authors of their safety;
   and they had thus despised the promises of God, so that there was no
   attention given to prayer: Abhor, then, does Jehovah thy confidences
   [71]

   He then adds, Thou shalt not prosper in them. It ought to be carefully
   observed, that whatever we resolve to do that is not approved by God,
   cannot possibly succeed; for God will subvert all our hopes. Let us
   then know that here is set before us the punishment of all unbelievers,
   who, being not content with God's protection, wander after vain and
   false objects of trust, and prefer to have men propitious to them
   rather than God himself. Now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [69] There are three other expositions of the words rendered by Calvin,
   "on this account." One is that of our version, "from him;" the second
   is, "from hence," i e , from Egypt, adopted by Piscator, Grotius, and
   Blayney; and the third is, "from here," i e , from this place, their
   own land; which, as Gataker says, is probably "the genuine sense:" it
   is a threatening, that they were to be led into captivity. The
   rendering of the Septuagint is, "enteuthen -- from hence," or from this
   place; of the Vulgate, "ab ista -- from that," meaning, evidently
   Egypt; of the Syriac and Targum, "ex hoc -- from this;" and of Arabic,
   "illinc -- from thence." The particle zh is "this," and not "that." --
   Ed

   [70] "The gesture" mentioned here, a striking example of, we find in 2
   Samuel 13:19. Many consider the v here as having the meaning of "with,"
   and render the line as Blayney does, -- With thy hands upon thy head.
   But more consistent with the genius of the language is to regard the
   auxiliary verb to be understood, -- And thy hands shall be on thy head.
   There is a similar phrase in Isaiah 35:10, which ought to be rendered
   thus, -- And everlasting joy shall be upon their heads. -- Ed.

   [71] The verb for "abhor" is m'm, which means to reject, that is, with
   disdain and contempt; and the same when followed by v, though often
   rendered "despise" in our version. It is rendered "reject, "without the
   v, in 1 Samuel 15:23; Jeremiah 7:29; and "despise" being followed by v
   in Judges 9:38; Jeremiah 4:30. The early versions and the Targum mostly
   differ, and none of them give the specific meaning of the verb, except
   that the Septuagint give its meaning when not followed by v, "aposato
   -- has rejected." The whole verse may be thus rendered, -- 37. Also
   from this place shalt thou go forth, And thy hands shall be on thy
   head: For rejected has Jehovah those in whom thou trustest, And thou
   shalt not prosper by them. It is not correct to render mvtchyk, "thy
   confidences;" for the word means "thy confided ones," it being a Huphal
   participle. The Syriac renders it, "those who afford thee confidence --
   fiduciam tibi praebentibus." Blayney's version is, "the objects of thy
   trust;" and he translates the verb, "reprobated." That this is its
   meaning when followed by v is evident from Jeremiah 6:30. -- Ed

   CHAPTER 3
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 3:1

   1. They say, If a man put away his wife, and she go from him, and
   become another man's, shall he return unto her again? shall not that
   land be greatly polluted? but thou hast played the harlot with many
   lovers; yet return again to me, saith the LORD.

   l. Dicendo, si dimiserit vir uxorem suam, et profecta ab eo, fuepit
   viri alterius, (id est, transierit ad alium virum) an revertetur ad eam
   adhuc? Annon pollutione polluta est terra in hoc? et tu scortata es cum
   sociis multis; revertere tamen ad me, dicit Jehova.


   Many regard this verse as connected with the last, and thus read them
   connectedly, "God hates false confidences, because he says, "etc. But
   this seems not to me to be suitable; for Jeremiah brings before us here
   a new subject, -- that God seeks to be reconciled to his people,
   according to what a husband does, who desires to receive into favor an
   unchaste wife, and is ready to grant her full pardon, and to take her
   again as a chaste and faithful wife. This verse, then, cannot be
   connected with the foregoing, in which, as we have seen, the people are
   condemned. The word lsmr lamer, means the same, as I think, as when we
   say in French, par maniere de dire, or as when it is commonly said,
   "Suppose a case." For the Prophet does not here introduce God as the
   speaker, but lays before us a common subject, with this preface, l'mr,
   lamer, that is, "Be it so, that a man divorces his wife, and she
   becomes allied to another husband, can she again return to her first
   husband? This is not usually done; but I will surpass whatever kindness
   there may be among men, for I am ready to receive thee, provided thou
   wilt in future observe conjugal fidelity, and part with thy adulteries
   and adulterers." [72]

   As to the main point, there is here no ambiguity: for God shews that he
   would be reconciled to the Jews, provided they proceeded not
   obstinately in their sinful courses. But in order to set forth more
   fully his mercy, he uses a comparison which must be a little more
   attentively considered. He had before said that he held the place of a
   husband, that the people occupied the station of a wife; and then he
   complained of the base perfidy of the people, who had forsaken him, and
   said that they had acted like a wife who, having despised her husband,
   prostituted herself to such adulterers as might happen to meet her: but
   he now adds, "Behold, if a man dismisses his wife, and she becomes the
   wife of another, he will never receive her again." And this was
   forbidden by the law. "But I am ready, "he says, "to receive thee,
   though I had not given thee the usual divorce at my pleasure, as
   husbands are wont to do who repudiate their wives, when there is
   anything displeasing in them." It is not a simple comparison, as many
   think; (I know not whether all think so, for I have not read any who
   seem to understand the true meaning;) for God does not simply compare
   himself to a husband who has repudiated his wife for adultery; but as I
   have already said, there are here two clauses. The Jews were then wont
   to divorce their wives even for slight causes, and for no cause at all.

   Now, God speaks thus by Isaiah,

   "Shew me the bill of your mother's divorcement,"
   (Isaiah 50:1)

   as though he had said, "I have not repudiated your mother." For if any
   one then departed from his wife, the law compelled him to take some
   blame on himself; for what was the bill of divorcement? It was a
   testimony to the wife's chastity; for if any one was found guilty of
   adultery, there was no need of divorcement, as it was a capital crime.
   (Leviticus 20:10; Deuteronomy 22:22.) Hence adulteresses were not
   usually divorced; but if any woman had conducted herself faithfully
   towards her husband, and he wished to repudiate her, the law
   constrained him to give her the bill of divorcement: "I repudiate this
   wife, not because she hath broken or violated the bond of marriage, but
   because her manners are not agreeable, because her beauty does not
   please me." Thus the husbands were then commanded to take some of the
   blame on themselves. Hence the Lord says by Isaiah,

   "Shew me the bill of your mother's divorcement;"

   as though he had said, "She has departed from me; she has broken the
   bond of marriage by her fornications; I am not then in fault for being
   alienated from you."

   God then does not mean in this place, that he had divorced the people;
   for this would have been wrong and unlawful, and could not have been
   consistent with the character of God. But as I have already said, there
   is here a twofold comparison. "Though a husband should fastidiously
   send away his wife, and she through his fault should be led to contract
   another marriage, and become the partner of another, as though in
   contempt of him, he could hardly ever bear that indignity, and become
   reconciled to her: but ye have not been repudiated by me, but are like
   a perfidious woman, who shamefully prostitutes herself to all whom she
   may meet with; and yet I am ready to receive you, and to forget all
   your base conduct." We now then understand the import of the words.

   In the second clause there is a comparison made from the less to the
   greater. For the return into favor would have been easier, if the
   repudiated wife had afterwards become acceptable to him, though she had
   become the wife of another; but when an adulteress finds her husband so
   willing of himself, and ready to grant free pardon, it is certainly an
   example not found among mortals. Thus we see that God, by an argument
   from the less to the greater, enhances his goodness towards the people,
   in order to render the Jews the less excusable for rejecting so
   pertinaciously a favor freely offered to them.

   But it may be asked, why the Prophet says, By pollution shall not this
   land be polluted, or, through this? I shall speak first of the words,
   and then refer to the subject. Almost all give this version, "Is not
   that land by pollution polluted." But I know not what sense we can
   elicit by such a rendering, except, it may be, that God compares a
   divorced wife to the land, or that he, by an abrupt transition,
   transfers to the land what he had said of a divorced wife, or rather
   that he explains the metaphor which had been used. If this sense be
   approved, then the copulative which follows must be rendered as a
   causative, which all have rendered adversatively, and rightly too, "But
   thou." I then prefer to read hhy', eeia, by itself, "by this;" that is,
   when a wife returns again to her first husband, after having married
   another; for the law, as we have said, forbad this; and the husband
   must have become an adulterer, if he took again the wife whom he had
   repudiated. Liberty was granted to women by divorce; not that divorce
   was by God allowed; but as the women were innocent, they were released,
   for God imputed the fault to the husbands. And when the repudiated wife
   married another man, this second marriage was considered legitimate.
   If, then, the first husband sought to recover the wife whom he had
   divorced, he violated the bond of the second marriage. For this reason,
   and according to this sense, the Prophet says, that the land would by
   this become polluted; as though he had said, "It is not lawful for
   husbands to take back their wives, however ready they may be to forgive
   them; but I require no other thing but your return to me."

   As to the words, we now see that the Prophet does not say without
   reason, "By this;" that is, when a woman unites herself to one man, and
   then to another, and afterwards returns to her first husband; for
   society would thus be torn asunder, and also the sacred bond of
   marriage, the main thing in the preservation of social order, would be
   broken.

   It is added, But thou hast played the harlot with many companions [73]
   What we have before observed is here confirmed, -- that the people had
   been guilty, not only of one act of adultery, but that they were become
   like common strumpets, who prostitute themselves to all without any
   difference; and this is what will be presently stated. Those whom he
   calls companions or friends were rivals. He says, Yet return to me,
   saith Jehovah: by which he intimated, -- "Pardon is ready for thee,
   provided thou repentest."

   An objection may, however, be here raised, -- How could God do what he
   had forbidden in his law? The answer is obvious, -- No other remedy
   could have been given to preserve order in society when men were
   allowed to repudiate their wives, except by adding this restraint, as a
   proof that God did not favor their levity and changeableness. It was
   thus necessary, for the interest of society, to punish such men as were
   too morose and rigid, by withholding from them the power of recovering
   the wives whom they had dismissed. It might otherwise have been, that
   one changed his love the third day, or in a month, or in a year, and
   demanded his wife. God then intended to put this restraint on divorce,
   so that no man, who had put away his wife, could take her again. But
   the case is very different as to God himself: it is therefore nothing
   strange that he claims for himself the right of being reconciled to the
   Jews on their repentance. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [72] The word at the beginning of this verse has puzzled most, the form
   being so unusual. It is left out by the Septuagint, the Syriac, and the
   Arabic The Vulgate has "vulgo dieitur -- it is commonly said." But l
   means at times "according to;" and it may be so rendered here, --
   According to what is said, If a man sends away his wife, And she goes
   from him and becomes another man's, Is he to return to her again?
   Polluted, shall it not be polluted, even that land? But thou hast
   played the harlot with many friends, Yet return to me, saith Jehovah.
   The particle hn in the first line is Chaldee for 'm; it is so rendered
   by the Targun and the early versions. The pronoun hhy' after "land"
   cannot be rendered as Calvin proposes; it agrees in gender with "land."
   It is singular that the Septuagint, the Vulgate, and the Arabic, have
   "woman" instead of "land;" yet the Syriac and Targum retain "land:" but
   in them all this pronoun is construed with the noun. Gataker takes
   "land" here, and in Deuteronomy 24:4, as meaning "the state," the
   community, and refers to Numbers 35:33; Psalm 106:38; Isaiah 24:5. --
   Ed

   [73] The Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Arabic, have by a mistake
   rendered the word "pastors" or shepherds; but the Vulgate has "lovers,"
   which our version and Blayney have adopted. But the word means
   companions, friends, intimates, neighbors. Gataker renders it "mates."
   -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 3:2

   2. Lift up thine eyes unto the high places, and see where thou hast not
   been lien with. In the ways hast thou sat for them, as the Arabian in
   the wilderness; and thou hast polluted the land with thy whoredoms, and
   with thy wickedness.

   2. Tolle oculos tuos ad loca excelssa (hoc est, ad colles,) et vide ubi
   non scortata fueris; super vias (vel, juxta vias) sedisti illis (hoc
   est, ad illos captandos,) quemadmodum Arabs in deserto; et polluisti
   terraim scortationibus tuis et malitia tua.


   As the Prophet had charged the Jews with being wanton in a loose and
   promiscuous manner, as it is the case with abandoned women, after
   having cast away all shame, that they might not evade the charge and
   object, that they were not conscious of any crime, he makes them in a
   manner the judges themselves, Raise up, he says, thine eyes to the high
   places and see; that is, "I bring forward witnesses sufficiently known
   to thee; there is no hill in the land where thou hast not been
   connected with idols." We have already said, and we shall find the same
   thing often mentioned by this Prophet, -- that superstitions are deemed
   idolatries by God. But it was a customary thing with the Jews to ascend
   high places, as though they were there nearer to God. This is the
   reason why the Prophet bids them to turn their eyes to all the hills:
   See, he says, whether is there any hill free from thy fornications. For
   as strumpets seek hiding -- places to perpetrate their obscenities, so
   the Jews sought hills as their brothels. And thus their impiety was the
   more execrable as they went forth openly, and especially as they wished
   their flagitious acts to be seen at a distance, ascending, as they did,
   elevated places; but strumpets, having found adulterers or paramours,
   are wont to seek some secret retreats. The Prophet then cuts off from
   the Jews every occasion for evading the charge, when he bids them to
   raise up their eyes to the high places; for when they prostrated
   themselves before their idols, it was the same as when strumpets commit
   acts of adultery.

   And he adds, that they sat by the ways, as the Arabian in the desert He
   again repeats what we have before observed, -- that the Jews were not
   led away by the enticement of others to violate the conjugal pledge
   which they had given to God, but were, on the contrary, moved by their
   own wantonness, so that they of themselves sought base and filthy
   gratifications, he had before said, "Thou hast corrupted others by thy
   wickedness;" and now he confirms the same, "Thou hast sat, he says, "by
   all the ways." This also is what is done by vile strumpets, who, as it
   has been said, have lost all shame. But the Prophet enhances this crime
   by another comparison, As an Arabian in the desert, who lies in wait
   for travelers, that he may rob and kill them: thus hast thou sat by the
   ways [74]

   We then see here a double comparison; one taken from strumpets, who
   having in time past made gain, when they find themselves neglected,
   besiege the ways, and offer themselves to any they may meet with. This
   is the first comparison; the other is, that they were like robbers, who
   lie in wait for travelers; as though he had said, that the Chaldeans
   and Egyptians were excusable when compared with the Jews, because they
   had been drawn by their wicked arts into illicit treaties, like a
   traveler who passing by is enticed by a robber, -- "What art thou but a
   helpless man; but if thou joinest me, and engagest to be my companion,
   there is the best prospect of gain, and new spoils will fall into our
   hands daily." Such a robber is twice and three times more wicked than
   the other. So also, the Prophet says of the Jews, that they were like
   old robbers, who had become hardened in intrigues, in plunders, and in
   every kind of wickedness, and had enticed to themselves both the
   Egyptians and the Assyrians. It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [74] Gataker suggests another idea,-that the reference is made to the
   Arabian traders, who fix their tents in the wilderness to wait for the
   merchants. Blayney renders the lines differently, -- Lift up thine eyes
   upon the open plains, and see; Where hast thou not been defiled in the
   highways? Thou hast sat waiting in them like an Arabian in the desert.
   To render sphym, "open plains," is without authority; it means "craggy
   eminences," or elevated places. See Numbers 23:3; Isaiah 41:18;
   Jeremiah 14:6. The division, too, is arbitrary. "The ways," or
   highways, connects better with the following verb; and lhm is not "in
   them," but to or for them, that is, her lovers, mentioned in the
   preceding verse. Our version is the most suitable, with which that of
   Calvin corresponds. "Arabian" is rendered "crow" by the Septuagint, the
   Syriac, and the Arabic; "robber" by the Vulgate, but "Arabian" by the
   Targum. It is true that the word for a crow is from the same root, but
   the iod attached to it shews it to be a proper name. Where the Vulgate
   got the word "robber," it is hard to know. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 3:3

   3. Therefore the showers have been withholden, and there hath been no
   latter rain; and thou hadst a whore's forehead, thou refusedst to be
   ashamed.

   3. Et prohibitae sunt pluviae, et serotina non fuit; et frons mulieris
   meretricis fuit tibi, recusasti erubescere.


   Jeremiah proceeds with his severe reproof, -- that the Jews were wholly
   given to wickedness, for they had altogether devoted themselves to
   superstitions, and also to unlawful alliances, and had in both
   instances despised God. He now shews how great and how strong was their
   obstinacy. Restrained, he says, have been the rains, there has not been
   the latter rain; yet the front of a harlot has been thine; as though he
   had said, that the Jews had not in any degree been subdued by
   punishment. It was a most atrocious wickedness to give no ear to pious
   warnings, when the prophets continually cried to them, and endeavored
   to restore them to the right way. That they thus hardened themselves
   against the addresses of the prophets, was a proof of the greatest
   impiety. But God tried also to restore them to himself by punishments,
   and those very heavy. He punished them with sterility; and the drought
   of which the Prophet speaks was no doubt so uncommon, that the Jews
   might perceive, had they a particle of a sound mind, that God was at
   war with them. It often happens that not a drop of rain fails from
   heaven; for we see that many summers are hot and dry: there is no doubt
   but that God then reminds us of our sins and exhorts us to repent. But
   as familiarity makes us to overlook God's judgments, he sometimes
   punishes us in a new and unusual manner. I doubt not then but that the
   Prophet, by saying, Restrained have been rains from them, refers to
   some extraordinary instance of God's vengeance, whereby the Jews might
   have perceived, except they were extremely besotted, that God was
   opposed to and displeased with them. [75]

   The import of what is said is, -- that the Jews had not only run here
   and there through a mad impulse, according to their own wills and
   inclinations, but that they had also been checked by evident judgments,
   since God had from heaven openly shewed himself to be the vindicator of
   his own glory, and as there had been so great a drought, that it
   appeared clear that the curse of the law had been fulfilled towards
   them,

   "I will make heaven iron to you, and the earth brass."
   (Leviticus 26:19)

   As to the latter rain, we have said elsewhere that by this word is
   meant the rain which falls just before harvest; and it is called
   "latter" with reference to the harvest. For, as there is great heat in
   those eastern parts, they want rain before the harvest commences; the
   extreme heat of the sun would otherwise scorch up the grain. Hence,
   they especially look for the latter rain, which comes shortly before
   harvest -- time. The other rain, in September and October, is called,
   on account of the sowing -- time, a seasonable rain; for it soaks and
   moistens the seed, that it may strike roots and gather rigor and
   strength. The object is to shew, that God had from heaven given to the
   Jews manifest tokens of his displeasure, and yet without any benefit;
   for they had the front of a harlot, and felt no shame; that is, they
   were moved by no judgments of God, and could not bear to be corrected.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [75] It is usual to render the v before "restrained," "therefore;" but
   the sentence will read better, connected as it is with the latter part
   of the previous verse, by giving it its most common meaning, -- And
   restrained have been the showers, And the latter rain has not been; Yet
   the front of a wanton woman hast thou had, Thou hast refused to be made
   ashamed. This last verb is in the Infinitive Huphal. It means in
   Hiphil, to make ashamed; and then in Huphal, to be made ashamed. The
   Targum expresses thus the general sense of the last line, "Thou hast
   been unwilling to humble thyself." The rest of the verse is rendered
   almost literally. The Septuagint and the Arabic wander very far from
   the Hebrew. The Vulgate is a literal version, and the Syriac is nearly
   so, only it connects "wickedness, "in the last verse, with restrained,
   thus, -- And for thy wickedness have been restrained the dews. And it
   is not improbable but that this was the original reading. -- Ed.

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast been once pleased not only to
   adopt us as thy children, but also to unite us to thyself by the bond
   of marriage, and to give us a pledge of this sacred union in thine only
   -- begotten Son, -- O grant, that we may continue in the faith of thy
   Gospel, and so honestly keep the pledge given to thee, that thou mayest
   also shew thyself to us as a Husband and as a Father, and that we may
   to the end find in thee that merciful kindness which is needful to
   retain us in the holy fear of thy name, until we shall at length enjoy
   fellowship with thee in thy celestial kingdom, through Christ our Lord.

   Jeremiah 3:4

   4. Wilt thou not from this time cry unto me, My father, thou art the
   guide of my youth?

   4. An non posthac clamabis ad me, Pater mi, dux adolescentiae meae tu
   es?


   God, after having set forth the wickedness of his people, and severely
   reproved them as they deserved, now kindly invites them to repentance,
   Wilt thou not say to me hereafter, he says, My Father! Some incorrectly
   render the words, "Wilt thou say to me, My Father," as though God would
   reject what they said: and they give the meaning, -- that the Jews
   would act dishonestly in thus glorying in God's name, from whom they
   were so alienated. But very different is the meaning of the Prophet:
   for God mitigates the severity of the reproof which we have observed,
   and shews that he would be ready to be reconciled to them, if they
   repented: nay, he waits not for their repentance, but of his own accord
   meets and allures these perfidious apostates: "What!" says God, "shall
   there be no more any union between us?" For God expresses here the
   feeling of one grieving and lamenting, when he saw the people
   perishing; and he seems anxious, if possible, to restore them.

   It is with this design that he asks, "Will they not again call on me as
   their Father and the guide of their youth?" And by this periphrastic
   way of speaking, he intimates that he was the husband of that people;
   for most tender is that love which a youth has for a young virgin in
   the flower of her age. God, then, makes use now of this comparison, and
   says, that he still remembered the love which he had manifested towards
   his people. In short, he shews here that pardon was ready, if the
   people sought reconciliation; and he confirms the same thing when he
   adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 3:5

   5. Will he reserve his anger for ever? will he keep it to the end?
   Behold, thou hast spoken and done evil things as thou couldest.

   5. An observabit in seculum? an custodiet in perpetuum? Ecce, loquuta
   es, et perpetrasti malitias (vel, scelera) et potuisti.


   God shews that it was the fault of the Jews, that he did not receive
   them into favor. And here he takes the argument from his own nature,
   and speaks of himself in the third person; and it is the same as though
   the Prophet had interposed this reasoning, "God is not inexorable, for
   he is as ready to forgive as he is long -- suffering: now, then, what
   prevents you from living happily again under his government? for he
   will spare you, provided he finds in you genuine repentance." We now
   then see, what the Prophet means here: for as God had kindly exhorted
   the people to repent, the Prophet speaks now generally of God's own
   nature, -- that he keeps not for ever, nor reserves perpetually

   These words, when put alone, mean that he does not cherish vengeance,
   and in our language we imitate the Hebrews, Il lui garde. This garde,
   when put without anything added to it, means, as I have said, that
   vengeance is cherished within. But nothing is more contrary than this
   to the nature of God. It hence follows, that the Jews had no obstacle
   in their way, except that they shunned God, and that being addicted to
   their own vices, they were unwilling to receive the pardon that was
   freely offered to them.

   As to the second clause, it admits of being explained in two ways. We
   may regard an adversative particle to be understood, "though thou hast
   spoken and hast done, "etc.; as if God had said, that he would be
   propitious to the Jews, however atrociously they might have sinned. But
   another view is more simple, -- that God here complains that there was
   no hope of amendment, as they had become hardened in their vices, "Thou
   hast spoken," he says, "thou hast done, and thou hast been able." And
   interpreters further vary in their views: for the copulative is
   explained by some as a particle of comparison, in the sense of k'sr,
   keasher, "according to what thou wert able, thou hast done wickedness."
   But others take the words more simply and more correctly, as I think,
   "Thou hast been very strong;" that is, thou hast exerted all thy power,
   so that thou hast put forth all thy strength in doing evil, as we say
   in Latin, pro virili, with all thy might; that is, as far as thy
   capacity extended, thou hast devoted thyself to wickedness. [76]

   I therefore give this explanation: God had before put on, as it were,
   the character of one in grief and sorrow, and kindly exhorted the
   people to repent, and testified that he would be ready to pardon them,
   and at the same time shewed in general that he would be propitious, as
   he is by nature inclined to mercy. After having set forth these things,
   he now adds, that he despaired of that people, because they gloried in
   their own wickedness: for to speak and to do means the same as if he
   had said, that the people were so impudent, that they boasted of their
   rebellion against God, and dared to call darkness light; for the
   superstitious, we know, glory against God without any shame. Now, such
   was the state of the people; for God, by his prophets, condemned this
   especially in them -- that they had corrupted the pure worship of the
   law; but they with a meretricious front dared to set up against him
   their own devotions and good intentions, as they are commonly called.
   As then, they thus presumptuously defended their wicked deeds, God here
   complains that they were in no way healable, and so he leaves them as
   past remedy. This I regard as the real meaning of the Prophet: and of
   similar import is the verb tvkl, tucal; "thou hast put forth all thy
   might," he says, that is, thou hast observed no limits in sinning, but,
   on the contrary, hast given thyself up to unbridled licentiousness. It
   now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [76] This and the preceding verse have been variously explained. The
   view given by Calvin has been most commonly adopted; but it is hardly
   consistent with a literal rendering of the original, which I consider
   to be as follows, -- 4. Hast thou not from this time called to me, "My
   Father, the guide of my youth art thou: 5. Will he reserve wrath for
   ever, Or keep it to the end?" Behold, thou hast so spoken, And hast
   done evils and persevered. "From this time," that is, the time spoken
   of before, when the people followed idolatry. During this time, they
   called God their Father, and promised themselves the remittance of his
   displeasure. They said this, and yet followed their superstitions. This
   is the view which Gataker seemed most disposed to take. Horsley thus
   paraphrases the last line, -- "Thou hast persisted incorrigibly in
   doing evil." The Septuagint give "called," in the past tense; the
   Vulgate, in the imperative, "voca -- call;" the Syriac, the Arabic, and
   the Targum, in the future tense, "Wilt thou not call," etc. The
   received text has qr'ty, which is no doubt wrong; the iod is not found
   in very many MSS., and all the early versions agree in giving the verb
   in the second person. The same is to be said of dvrty, it ought to be
   dvrt, though Horsley prefers the former; but neither the early versions
   nor the context favor it. The phrase mth is rendered by the Septuagint,
   "hos oikon -- as a house," and by the Arabic, "ut filia -- as a
   daughter." How such mistakes could have been made, it is difficult to
   say. The Syriac has "hereafter;" and the Targum, "from this time." --

   Jeremiah 3:6-8

   6. The LORD said also unto me in the days of Josiah the king, Hast thou
   seen that which backsliding Israel hath done? she is gone up upon every
   high mountain and under every green tree, and there hath played the
   harlot.

   6. Et dixit Jehova ad me in diebus Josiae regis, An vidisti quid
   fecerit aversatrix (alii vertunt, rebellis) Israel? Profecta est ipsa
   super omnem montem excelsum, et subtus omnem arborem frondosam, et
   scortata est illic:

   7. And I said after she had done all these things, Turn thou unto me.
   But she returned not. And her treacherous sister Judah saw it

   7. Et dixi, Post facere ipsam (hoc est, postquam fecit omnia haec,) Ad
   me revertere (alii in tertia persona reddunt, Revertatur;) et non
   reversa est: et vidit perfida ejus soror Jehudah.

   8. And I saw, when for all the causes whereby backsliding Israel
   committed adultery I had put her away, and given her a bill of divorce;
   yet her treacherous sister Judah feared not, but went and played the
   harlot also.

   8. Et vidi, quod super his omnibus (hoc est, quod propter haec, nempe
   'dvt significat occasiones vel causas,) quia scortata erat rebellis
   Israel, dimiserim ipsam (repudiaverim,) et dederim librum repudiorum
   ejus (repudii ejus) illi, et non timuit perfida Jehudah soror ejus, et
   scortata est etiam ipsa.


   Here the Prophet enters on a new discourse: he relates what God had
   committed to him, and mentions the time, even in the reign of Josiah.
   It is indeed well known, that the land was then cleansed from
   superstitions; for that pious king labored to restore the true worship
   of God, and to remove all the filth and defilements, by which the
   temple and the whole of religion had been corrupted. He strenuously
   exerted himself, and no doubt there was an improved appearance of
   religion throughout the land; but we shall see that a great portion of
   the people were under the influence of hypocrisy and deceit., as it is
   usually the case when rulers seek to support the pure worship of God,
   and to free it from all corruptions; for there are many hypocrites, who
   for a time dissemble, while the same antipathy to God still remains.
   Such was then the condition of the people.

   And this ought to be carefully observed; for Jeremiah might have
   appeared to have dealt somewhat too sharply and rigorously with his own
   nation, as reform was in the mouth of all, according to what we find to
   be the case with many now, who having left the superstitions of the
   Papacy, seemed at first to embrace the doctrines of the Gospel, but all
   now wish to be satisfied with any kind of reformation; at the same
   time, they shake off the yoke of Christ and can bear submission to no
   discipline: in short, their object, is to subvert all order; and yet
   they boldly claim to be the advocates of reformation, whenever their
   impiety is reproved. This was no doubt the contest which Jeremiah had
   to carry on, the same with that by which the Lord tries his servants at
   this day. He therefore says, that he received this commission in the
   days of Josiah, that is, when that king was laboring to establish the
   pure worship of God, and no one dared to oppose; for we find that God
   was then worshipped by the whole people without any external
   corruptions.

   But what is contained in this commission? Hast thou seen, he says, what
   apostate Israel hath done? God here compares the ten tribes with the
   tribe of Judah, with whom was united, as it is well known, the half
   tribe of Benjamin: he then compares Israel with the tribe of Judah, "Do
   you not see what rebellious Israel hath done?" But he introduces the
   kingdom of Israel, as well as the kingdom of Judah, under the character
   of women; for God, as it has already appeared, represents himself as
   the husband of his people. He then says that he had two wives, even
   Israel and Judah. God had indeed espoused to himself the whole seed of
   Abraham by one contract; but Jeremiah speaks here in a popular manner.
   Though the Israelites had departed from God, yet he had not wholly
   rejected them. The kingdom of Israel had then become adulterous; but
   God for a time bore with that sin, so that the covenant, in part,
   remained. For this reason he acknowledges as his wives both Israel and
   Judah. Hence he says, "Hast thou not seen what estranged Israel hath
   done?" The word msvh, meshibe, is derived from svv, shub, which
   signifies, both to return and to depart; and Jerome everywhere renders
   it aversatrix, one who turns aside, or is estranged. [77] But some
   render it "rebellious;" we might say more correctly in French,
   debauchee She went, he says, on every high hill, and under every shady
   tree, and there played the harlot In short, God complains that the ten
   tribes had violated the sacred bond of marriage, when they prostituted
   themselves to idols, even on all high hills and under all shady trees:
   for as I have already said, they chose those places as though there was
   some holiness both on mountains and under shades of trees.

   He afterwards adds, Yet I said; God here states, that he had long
   suspended his judgment before he punished the people of Israel. He then
   extols here his patience, that he had not immediately visited the
   Israelites as they deserved, but bore with them and for a long time
   waited to see whether they could be reclaimed: I said, then, after she
   had done all these things, Return to me If we read in the third person,
   the sense will be the same, "I hoped indeed that they would return to
   the right way, though they had thus fallen away, yea though they had
   denied me by an impious defection, and had become alienated from the
   faith and from piety." But I am more inclined to another view, -- that
   God here records the fact, that he had recalled to himself the ten
   tribes by his servants the Prophets, though they had by their many
   crimes provoked his wrath. Here then God shews how perverse the
   Israelites had been; for he had tried to restore them, if possible, to
   himself, but had spent all his labor in vain. I thus explain, I said,
   of the prophetic instruction: "Though then the Israelites had plunged
   themselves into impieties, I yet ceased not to try whether they could
   be restored to me." He intimates, in short, that he had been unlike
   those husbands, who will not be reconciled to their wives, burning with
   jealousy, because they see that they had been exposed to so much
   disgrace. God then shews that though the Israelites had departed from
   him, he yet sent his prophets, and of his own free will sought
   reconciliation with them, but that they had refused to return. [78]

   He then adds, See did she, that is, the whole kingdom of Judah, that,
   for al1 this, because the rebellious Israel had played the harlot, etc.
   We shall hereafter find the design of this comparison; for he amplifies
   the sin of the kingdom of Judah, inasmuch she had time enough to
   observe what he now relates, and was able to see it at a distance as it
   were from a watchtower; yet she saw it without any advantage. God then
   intended to shew how great was the hardness of the Jews, who had seen
   the defection of the ten tribes, and had seen how severely they had
   been reproved by the prophets.

   He then says, And I saw As he had said that the kingdom of Judah had
   seen what happened to Israel, so he now says, that he had seen both,
   See then did I Now, what does he declare that he had seen? Even that
   Judah had played the harlot; for he now speaks of Judah as of a woman.
   Then God says, that it was not a thing hid from him that Judah had
   surpassed the crimes of her sister, not through ignorance or deception,
   but through deliberate wickedness: See, he says, did I, that
   notwithstanding all these things, she played the harlot He thus
   explains more fully what he had briefly touched upon before. He had
   said, that Judah had seen, but this on account of its brevity might
   have appeared ambiguous: he therefore explains it more at large; "See
   did Judah that I gave a bill of divorcement to her sister, because she
   had played the harlot; and yet she feared not;" that. is, she thought
   not of repenting, when she had such a striking example of vengeance set
   before her eyes.

   But it may be here asked, how could it be said that a bill of divorce
   had been given to the Israelites, when he denies by the Prophet Isaiah
   that he had given it? (Isaiah 50:1.) But the Prophet here takes another
   view of the subject; for he does not speak here of the bills of
   divorce, such as were usually given, when a husband repudiated a wife
   who had been chaste and faithful; but he speaks of that lawful divorce,
   when a woman, convicted of adultery, is liable to a capital punishment.
   God then by his prophet Isaiah denies that he had given a bill of
   divorcement; but he says here that he had given it, because he had
   repudiated an adulterous woman. It was not indeed at that time
   customary among the Jews to divorce an adulteress, for she was led to
   execution. But we have seen at the beginning of the chapter that there
   is a difference between God and husbands. As then God did not deal, as
   he might have justly done, with the Israelites, and did not execute a
   capital punishment, as he might rightly have done, and what was usually
   done, he says that he had given a bill of divorce, that is, that he had
   repudiated that people. But by the bill of divorce he means exile; for
   when the ten tribes were banished, it was the same as though God openly
   shewed that he had no connection with that people: as long as they
   continued in the holy land and in the promised inheritance, some kind
   of union remained; but when they were dispersed here and there, and
   every sort of worship had ceased among them, and also when the very
   kingdom of Israel had no longer an existence, God had then divorced
   them.

   See then did her sister Judah, and she feared not It was indeed an
   instance of great insensibility, not to learn wisdom at the expense of
   others; and it is a complaint found everywhere in the prophets, -- that
   the Jews were not stimulated to repentance, while God spared them, and
   at the same time set before them examples which ought in all reason to
   have terrified them. For what ought they to have considered, but that
   God would punish those many transgressions by which they provoked his
   wrath, since he had not spared their brethren? They saw that the
   kingdom of Israel had been abolished, and yet all of them derived their
   origin from the same father, even Abraham: how was it then that they so
   heedlessly despised God's judgment, which had been for a long time
   before their eyes? Hence he complains that they feared not It now
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [77] It is correctly rendered as a noun, for had it been an adjective
   or a participle, it would have followed the word Israel. Literally it
   is, "the apostates," -- Hast thou seen what she did, the apostates
   Israel? Or, it may be rendered, "the backslider Israel," though the
   word is deficient, having no feminine termination. -- Ed.

   [78] The difficulty at the beginning of the eighth verse may be removed
   either by adopting v'r'h, as in two MSS., and taking the verb to be in
   Hiphil, or vtr', as in one MS., as a repetition of the former verb,
   according to the Syriac It is left out in the Vulgate But it is most
   suitable to the context to take the verb to be in Hiphil. Then the
   passage would read thus, -- 6. Hast thou not seen what she did, the
   apostate Israel? Go did she on every high hill and under every green
   tree, And play there the harlot: 7. And I said, after she had done all
   these things, "To me return;" but she returned not: And see this did
   the hypocrite, her sister Judah: 8. And I caused her to see, that on
   all these accounts, As adultery the apostate Israel would commit, I
   dismissed her, and gave to her The bill of her divorcement; Yet fear
   not, did the hypocrite Judah, her sister, But went and played the
   harlot, even herself. "On all these accounts," or, for all these
   reasons, refers to several things-the first apostasy -- God's
   invitation -- and Israel's refusal. God caused Judah to see these
   things by his prophets, but Judah feared not. The word vgdh, hypocrite,
   or the perfidious one, is a feminine participle, used as a noun. It is
   explained in the tenth verse by "feignedly" or falsely. Hypocrites
   would be the correct rendering. It is rendered by the Septuagint,
   "faithless -- asunthetos," -- by the Vulgate, "prevaricatress --
   praevaricatrix, "and by the Targum, "falsifier" or cheat. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 3:9

   9. And it came to pass through the lightness of her whoredom, that she
   defiled the land, and committed adultery with stones and with stocks.

   9. Et factum est a velocitate (vertunt tam Hieronymus quam alii
   interpretes, facilitatem; nomen deductum est a qll, quod significat
   interdum esse velocem; hic levitas notatur, vel petulantia, factum est,
   igitur, a levitate, aut petulantia) scortationum ejus, ut pollueret
   terram (vel, contaminaret; alii vertunt, peccare faceret; sed
   Hieronymus ubique fere reddit hoc verbum per contaminare, neque male
   quadrat,) et scortata est cum lapide et cum ligno.


   Here the Prophet completes his charge, -- that so far was it that the
   punishment which God had inflicted on the Israelites, had any effect on
   the tribe of Judah, that she surpassed by her levity and lustfulness
   the whoredomes of her sister. She has polluted, he says, the land, or
   made the land to sin, that is, rendered the land guilty. It is indeed
   what greatly exaggerates the crime, when it is said that the land
   became guilty or contaminated. The land, we know, was in itself pure,
   and could contract no pollution from the vices of men; but that the
   impiety of men might be exhibited the more detestable, the land is said
   to have been contaminated by them:

   Or, it may be said that the land was made guilty. How so? The reason
   why they are said to have contaminated the land or to have made it
   guilty or to have implicated it in their own vices, he gives in these
   words, she has played the harlot with stone and with wood [79] Of this
   metaphor of playing the harlot it is not necessary now to speak; for we
   have said already, that this similitude is often repeated, because God
   had united that people to himself and bound them to him, as it were, by
   the sacred bond of marriage. Hence whenever the people departed from
   the pure worship of God, they were justly said to have played the
   harlot, for they violated their pledged faith: as simplicity of faith
   is spiritual chastity, so apostasy is that shamelessness and perfidy,
   when a wife becomes unfaithful to her husband by following adulterers.
   It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [79] This verse may be thus rendered, -- And it was, that through the
   report of her fornication, She polluted the land; And she committed
   adultery with stone and wood. There is no instance of ql, in the sense
   of swiftness, etc., being used as a noun. It is the Chaldee for qvl,
   voice, fame, report. Gataker paraphrases the words thus, "by her
   notorious fornication." The early versions and the Targum all differ.
   Excessive addiction to idolatry is evidently what is spoken of. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 3:10

   10. And yet for all this her treacherous sister Judah hath not turned
   unto me with her whole heart, but feignedly, saith the LORD.

   10. Atque etiam in tote hoc (vel, in his onmibus) non reversa est ad me
   perfida (vel, fraudulenta: dgv est fraudare) sorer ejus Jehudah in toto
   corde suo, sed in mendacio, inquit Jehova.


   He goes on with the same subject, -- that the Jews were not moved by
   any fear when they saw the dreadful vengeance executed on their
   brethren on account of their sins. Her perfidious sister, he says,
   returned not to me, that is, after so many warnings by the prophets and
   such an example of punishment. He however adds an explanation, -- she
   turned not with her whole heart, but feignedly and falsely. [80]

   The Prophet anticipates here such objections as the Jews might have
   alleged, "What! thou deniest that we have returned! Is not the whole
   land cleansed from idolatries? Is not God worshipped according to the
   requirements of the law? Is there any more an altar seen under the
   shades of trees or on hills?" As then they might have thus evaded the
   charge as they usually did, the Prophet obviates such an evasion and
   says, "Though they have ill appearance given some tokens of repentance,
   yet they have only put on a disguise and have acted falsely towards
   God; for there is no integrity in them." We now more clearly see why he
   had before specifically mentioned the time of Josiah; for the Jews then
   returned feignedly to God: there was in the king and in a few a right
   feeling, but in the rest dissimulation only. God then in a few words
   shews, that he cares not for that reformation which is false and
   feigned, but that he requires a genuine feeling within: hence he thus
   concludes --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [80] This verse stands connected, not with the preceding, but with the
   eighth, -- Yea, even for all this, Return to me did not the hypocrite,
   Her sister Judah, with all her heart, But in falsehood, saith Jehovah.
   "In falsehood," or, by dealing falsely, as it may be taken by a
   participle preceded by a preposition. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 3:11

   11. And the LORD said unto me, The backsliding Israel hath justified
   herself more than treacherous Judah.

   11. Et dixit Jehova ad me, justificavit animam suam aversatrix Israel
   prae fraudulenta Jehuda (vel, perfida, semper est vgdh.)


   We now see more clearly for what purpose Jeremiah compared the ten
   tribes with the kingdom of Judah; it was done in order to shew that the
   Jews, who wished to be deemed far more holy than others, were yet more
   perfidious and deserved a heavier punishment, because they acted so
   deceitfully with God.

   It may be here asked, why he pronounces the Jews worse than the
   Israelites, while they still continued in a sort of middle state of
   things. We indeed know that the kingdom of Judah was become so corrupt,
   that hardly any religion remained there; yet the temple was still
   standing and the priesthood still existed at Jerusalem. But the Prophet
   condemns the Jews more than the Israelites for other reasons, even
   because they ought to have become wise through the calamities of
   others, and they ought to have been confirmed in true religion when
   they saw their brethren falling away from the pure worship of God:
   these things they ought to have maturely considered. It was this supine
   sottishness that rendered them worse than all their brethren, and also
   their pride, the chief cause of their condemnation, for they boasted
   that they remained perfect, while the ten tribes had become
   degenerated. These were the reasons why he says that Israel, though a
   perfidious woman, was yet more righteous than her sister Judah.

   The language indeed is not to be strictly taken when it is said, that
   she justified her soul; for God does not here excuse the Israelites,
   nor does he free or absolve them from guilt, (for he had severely
   punished them;) but this way of speaking is commonly used by the
   prophets; -- Sodom was righteous in comparison with Jerusalem; and Tyre
   and Sidon were just when compared with the Jews. (Ezekiel 16:47, 48.)
   Justified then has she her soul, [81] even the treacherous or the
   apostate Israel, in comparison with the perfidious Judah; that is, for
   the reasons which I have stated. The obstinacy of the Jews was greater
   and less excusable: the external worship of God, which they had
   retained, ought to have been a bridle to check them; and they had also
   seen how severe a judge God had been towards the ten tribes; but the
   judgments of God they despised, and derived no benefit from them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [81] This is the literal expression, but the word nphs is often taken
   for oneself, and ought often to be so rendered. See Numbers 30:5; Job
   18:4; Psalm 7:2; God is said to swear by his soul, that is, by himself,
   Amos 6:8 -- Then said Jehovah to me, -- Justified herself hath apostate
   Israel, More than the hypocrite Judah. Manifest and open apostasy is
   more honest than the double dealing of hypocrites, who combine God's
   worship with idolatry; nor is it so hateful to God. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast deigned to adopt us as thy
   people, and to unite us to thyself in thine only -- begotten Son, -- O
   grant, that we may continue pure and chaste in our obedience to thy
   Gospel, and never turn aside to those corruptions which disunite that
   sacred bond of union, which has been confirmed between us by the blood
   of thy Son, but that we may so persevere in serving thee, that our
   whole life and all our actions may be evidences of that holy calling,
   by which is laid up for us the hope of eternal salvation, until we
   shall at length come into the possession of that kingdom which has been
   obtained for us by so great a price, and there enjoy the fruit of our
   faith, sincerity, and perseverance, through Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 3:12

   12. Go and proclaim these words toward the north, and say, Return, thou
   backsliding Israel, saith the LORD; and I will not cause mine anger to
   fall upon you: for I am merciful, saith the LORD, and I will not keep
   anger for ever.

   12. Vade et clama (hoc est, cum clamore intona) sermones hos versus
   Aquilonem, et dic, Revertere rebellis Israel, dicit Jehova: non, non
   faciam incumbere (cadere, ad verbum) iram meam (alii vertunt, faciem
   meam; sed metaphorice slgnificat iram) in vos, quia clemens ego, dicit
   Jehova, non servabo in seculum.


   The Prophet, after having shewn that the tribe of Judah deserved a
   heavier punishment than the ten tribes, and having mentioned the cause,
   that they had seen their brethren severely chastised and were not
   moved, now turns his discourse to the Israelites themselves, or the ten
   tribes, and promises that God would be propitious to them. The kingdom
   of Israel had now been overthrown, and the people had been banished
   into Assyria, Persia, and Media. They had been scattered, and the name
   of the kingdom had been obliterated. The land had been often laid waste
   and the kingdom partly existed, as four tribes only were first driven
   to exile; but at, length the very name of a kingdom ceased to exist,
   and they were all, as I have said, led away into captivity. Hence the
   Prophet is bidden to address his words towards the north; for though
   the greater part of the people dwelt then in the east, yet as they had
   been banished by the Assyrians, God had a regard to the capital of the
   monarchy in bidding the Prophet to address those whom the enemies had
   led away to the north.

   Cry, then, not so much on account of the distance of the place, but
   that the Jews, who were deaf, might hear him crying; for the Prophet
   was bidden to speak not only for the sake of the Israelites, but that
   through them he might set before the Jews the mercy of God, if only
   they returned to a sound mind. Now the import of the whole is, -- that
   though the Israelites had been rebellious and had turned away from God,
   yet pardon was ready for them, if they returned. What the Prophet means
   by the word return, we have already in part explained, and we shall
   have to speak on the subject more fully elsewhere. He then requires
   repentance, and promises that God would be propitious to them in case
   they returned to him.

   He afterwards adds, I will not make my face, or rather, my wrath, to
   fall upon you; for this latter meaning is the most appropriate. God had
   already severely punished their sins; for what can happen to a people
   more grievous than to be banished from their own country, and then to
   be oppressed by cruel tyranny? They yet suffered a heavier punishment;
   for the worship according to the Law had been taken away from them,
   they had been repudiated by God, they had lost that glory by which they
   thought that they excelled all other nations in having been chosen as
   God's peculiar people. All these things had been entirely lost. In what
   sense then does God declare that he would not be angry with them? By
   this way of speaking the Prophet simply means, that God would not be
   irreconcilable, as though he had said, "My wrath shall not dwell, or
   shall not he upon you; but I will mitigate the punishment which I have
   inflicted." Hence I do not disapprove of Jerome's rendering, "I will
   not make steady," (firmabo;) though when he adds "face, "he does not
   sufficiently set forth the meaning of the Prophet. But this may be
   admitted, "I will not make steady my wrath upon you;" that is, "My
   wrath shall not lie or dwell on your heads, so as wholly to overwhelm
   you." God's wrath had already fallen upon them, but in such a way that
   there was still some hope of deliverance. God then denies, that the
   calamities, by which he had chastised their sins, would be fatal, for
   he would withdraw his hand and not pursue them to the last extremity.

   The meaning then is, -- that if the people returned to God they would
   obtain pardon, because God of his own free will invited them and
   promised that the punishment which he had inflicted on account of their
   sins, would be only for a time. [82]

   God further confirms this truth by mentioning what his nature is, for
   merciful am I, and I will not retain wrath for ever The promise was
   special in case the people returned; God now adds a general truth by
   way of confirmation, -- that he was disposed to shew mercy, and that he
   would readily forgive for his mercy's sake. Since God then is such, and
   cannot deny himself, there is no reason why a sinner should despair and
   thus close up the way, that he should not in his penitence implore
   God's mercy.

   We may hence gather a profitable doctrine, -- that whenever unbelief
   lays hold on our minds, so that we cannot apply to our benefit the
   promises of God, this should ever be remembered by us -- that God is
   merciful. As God then is so gracious, that he reserves not wrath for
   ever, but that it is only for a time, we ought to entertain hope; and
   corresponding with this is what is said in the Psalms,

   "A moment is he in his wrath;
   and life is in his goodness and mercy," (Psalm 30:5;)

   as though he had said, that God's wrath soon passes away, provided we
   repent, but that he shews his mercy through all ages; for this is what
   is meant by the word "life." He then goes on --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [82] 12. Go and proclaim these words towards the north, and say, --
   Return, apostate Israel, saith Jehovah; I will not cause my wrath to
   fall on you, For merciful am I, saith Jehovah; I will not reserve it
   for ever. That phny, commonly rendered "face," means sometimes wrath or
   anger, is evident, see Psalm 21:9; Lamentations 4:16. God is said to
   have his face against the wicked, Psalm 34:16, and to make his face to
   shine on his people, Psalm 80:3. This accounts for the word being taken
   sometimes, as it were, in a bad sense: He has an angry as well as a
   smiling face. The rendering of the Septuagint is, "I will not set firm
   (sterio) my face upon you," of the Vulgate, "I will not turn away my
   face from you," of the Syriac and Arabic, "I will not harden my face
   against you," and of the Targum, "I will not send my wrath upon you."
   The last comes nearest to the Hebrew. Blayney's version is a
   paraphrase, -- I will not look down upon you with a lowering brow; and
   so is his version of the last line, -- I will not keep displeasure in
   view for ever. Our version in both instances is much to be preferred.
   -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 3:13

   13. Only acknowledge thine iniquity, that thou hast transgressed
   against the LORD thy God, and hast scattered thy ways to the strangers
   under every green tree, and ye have not obeyed my voice, saith the
   LORD.

   13. Tantnm modo (vel, atqui) cognosce iniquitatem tuam, quia adversus
   Jehovam Deum tuum scelerate egisti, et dispersisti (vel, dissipasti,
   aut, prostituisti) vias tuas alienis, sub omni arbore frondosa, et
   vocem meam non audivisti, inquit Jehova.


   God lays down here a condition, lest hypocrites, relying on his
   goodness, should become more and more hardened, and yet think that he
   is bound as it were to them; for they usually reason thus, -- "God is
   so kind that he recalls us to himself, and of his own free will invites
   even sinners; we may therefore easily settle matters with him." Thus
   hypocrites by false thoughts' delude themselves, thinking that they can
   elude God, since he seeks nothing else but to restore sinners to
   himself. Hence with the promise of favor there ought ever to be
   connected an exhortation to repentance. God then reminds here the
   Israelites, that they were greatly deceived, if they thought they could
   without any difficulty obtain pardon.

   Hence he says, know thine iniquity The particle 'k, ak, may be rendered
   only, or but, or yet. I prefer the second meaning, but; for an
   exception, as I have said, is here added, lest the Israelites slumbered
   in their vices, if they persuaded themselves that God was, as it, were,
   in their power and subject to their will. We hence see that the
   Prophet, modifying what he had said, introduces this sentence, "But in
   the meantime know thine iniquity, otherwise thou canst expect no peace
   with God." Then these words follow, because thou hast acted wickedly
   against Jehovah thy God By these words the Prophet proves that the
   Israelites were guilty, lest they supposed that they could by evasions
   escape the wrath of God; for we know that often, even those who are
   conscious of their guilt, are not willing to confess their sins; and it
   is strange that men are so besotted as ever to contend with God. On
   this account the Prophets, when they exhorted the people to repent, at
   the same time brought to light their sins. Were there in men frankness
   and honesty, there would be no need thus to charge them; but as they
   either boldly deny their sins, or are so callous as to be moved by no
   fear, it is necessary to prick them sharply and even deeply to wound
   them. This is what the Prophet now does; Thou, he says, hast done
   wickedly against thy God; as though he had said, "I do not now in vain
   remind thee to own thy sins, for God himself condemns thee: think not
   thou that thou canst gain anything by thy subterfuges."

   He mentions also particulars, that he might come into closer quarters
   with them, Thou hast dispersed, he says, or scattered, thy ways to
   strangers, under every shady tree He again compares the Israelites to
   strumpets, who commonly so prostitute themselves, that they ramble from
   one place to another, invite and allure all they meet with. The Prophet
   then says, that the Israelites had thus dispersed themselves. He speaks
   delicately on an indelicate subject. But what he means is, that the
   Israelites were not content with one kind of superstition or with one
   idol, but blended together as many superstitions as they could, and
   borrowed false notions from all quarters: they were like a rambling
   strumpet, who prostitutes herself to all men indifferently. And
   strangers he calls all their fictitious gods; for as I have often said,
   they ought to have regarded him as their husband. When therefore the
   Israelites turned away to other gods, they became like a woman, who
   leaves her husband and prostitutes herself to any she can find. It is
   indeed a most common thing for those who forsake the true worship of
   God to seek for themselves various errors from all quarters, and to
   abandon themselves unreservedly to all kinds of superstitions.

   He at length adds, And thou hast not hearkened to my voice By this fact
   the Prophet enhances their sin; for they had been instructed in the
   doctrine of the law, and understood the right way of salvation: how
   then was it that they thus polluted themselves with so many
   superstitions? It could not have been attributed to ignorance. It was
   then their manifest rebellion against God. The Prophet then shews that
   they had been disobedient and intractable, and that they had relapsed
   into idolatry and pernicious errors, because they had shaken off the
   yoke of God, and suffered not themselves to be ruled and guided by his
   word. [83]

   We now then perceive the meaning of this verse: God first requires a
   confession of sins from the Israelites; and thus he sets forth how
   available that return would be which he had previously mentioned; for
   until a sinner knows his sinfulness, he will never really and from the
   heart return to God, as the beginning of repentance is the confession
   of guilt. He then proves them to have been guilty, that he might cut
   off from them every pretense for evasion. He mentions in the third
   place specific sins, that he might hold them as it were fast bound,
   even that they had polluted themselves with superstitions, and that
   they had become, not only like an adulterous woman who follows another
   man, but also like filthy strumpets, who run here and there and make no
   difference between men known or unknown. He shews in the last place,
   that all this happened through mere obstinacy; for they had cast aside
   every regard for God, though he had given them his law, and sent the
   prophets as its faithful interpreters, so that they understood what God
   approved and what was just and right. The reason then why they went
   astray was, that they closed their ears to God's word, and suffered not
   themselves to be ruled by it, but became wholly unteachable. Let us go
   on --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [83] But yet know thine iniquity, That against Jehovah thy God hast
   thou rebelled; For thou hast diversified thy ways for strangers, Under
   every green tree; And to my voice ye hearkened not, saith Jehovah. The
   word 'k is rendered by the early versions and the Targum, But, or But
   yet, or Nevertheless, "Verum," "Verumtamen." The third line is thus
   explained by Parkhurst, "Thou hast run after various heathen nations in
   their several idolatries." And this they did, while they refused to
   attend to the voice of God. To attend to, rather than to obey, is what
   is meant. So the Vulgate and the Syriac, "My voice ye heard not," or,
   as the former, "thou didst not hear." -- Ed

   Jeremiah 3:14

   14. Turn, O backsliding children, saith the LORD; for I am married unto
   you: and I will take you one of a city, and two of a family, and I will
   bring you to Zion:

   14. Revertimini filii rebelles, dieit Jehova, quoniam ego maritus
   vester (vel, dominatus sum in vobis, ut alii vertunt; alii, taedio
   affectus sum in vobis; dicemus postea de hoc verbo,) et assumam vos,
   unum e civitate, et duos e familia (vel, cognatione, vel, tribu,) et
   addueam vos in Sion.


   Jeremiah repeats the same thing in other words; but God by so many
   words shews clearer how ready he would be to grant pardon, provided the
   Israelites really repented. It would have been enough for God to
   testify once, that he would be reconcilable, but seeing that they were
   slow and hard to believe, he proceeds in the same strain. It is a
   wonderful forbearance and kindness that God, finding his favor
   neglected, and as it were rejected through the sloth of men, should yet
   persevere, and invite them again and again. What man would thus
   patiently bear the loathing of his favor and kindness? But we see that
   God does not immediately reject the tardy and the slothful, but adds
   new stimulants that he might at length move them, though this may seem
   more than necessary. How great is our torpidity? Were not God daily to
   urge us, how little attention would any of us give to his admonitions?
   It is, therefore, no wonder that he, pardoning our tardiness, should
   again and again invite us to repentance; which we find is done
   continually in the Church.

   This, then, is the reason why the Prophet now repeats the same thing,
   Return, now, ye rebellious children; for he had said before, "Return,
   thou rebellious Israel." He then adds, For I am a husband to you Some
   regard vl bol, in the sense of being wearied, when found as here, vlty
   vkm bolti bekem, "I have been wearied by you:" but this meaning does
   not comport with this passage. [84] More correctly, then, have others
   rendered the words, "I am lord to you: "but this lord is not to be
   taken indefinitely as in Latin, for it properly means a husband, who is
   a lord to his wife. God, then, no doubt, continues the same comparison,
   that of a marriage, which has already been often mentioned; for he
   charges the Israelites with adultery, because they had departed from
   him. Hence it is that he says, I am your husband He had previously
   said, "Though a person, when he repudiates his wife, and she be married
   to another, will never again be reconciled to her; yet I am ready to
   forgive your perfidy and wantonness: only observe chastity hereafter,
   and I will deal kindly with you." Similar is this passage, "I am your
   husband," though I have repudiated you. He had, indeed, said, that he
   had given them a bill of divorce, and thus testified, as by a public
   document, that there was no longer any connection between him and that
   people, for exile was a kind of divorce; but he says now, "I am your
   husband; for though I have been grievously offended with you, because
   you have broken your pledged faith, I yet remain in the same mind, so
   as to be ready to be your husband."

   We now, then, perceive the real meaning of the Prophet: despair might
   have laid hold on the Israelites so as to dread that access to which
   the Prophet had invited them; but that no terror might hinder them to
   repent, God here declares that he would become their husband, and that
   he had not forgotten that relationship with which he had once favored
   them. The sum of what he says is, "I have once embraced you with the
   love of a husband; ye have, indeed, become alienated from me, but
   return, and I am ready to forgive and to receive you, as though ye had
   always been faithful to me."

   Again will I take you, he says; and then he adds, one from a city, two
   from a family Deserving of especial notice is this passage; for God
   shews that they were not to wait for one another, and also, that though
   the whole body of the people rotted in their sins, yet a few would
   return to him, and that he would be reconciled to them. This was a
   point most necessary to be taught; for God's covenant was in common
   with the whole seed of Abraham; they might then have concluded that the
   covenant was extinct, except he gathered together the whole people; for
   he had not chosen one or two or a hundred or a thousand, but all the
   seed of Abraham. Since then the promise, without exception, was common,
   to all, any one might thus reason, "What connection have I with God,
   except as one born of the race of Abraham? but I am not alone, for we
   are all the children of Abraham: yet I see that none turn to God, so I
   must perish with the rest of the people." Now, that this thought should
   not hinder the godly, he says, "I will take one from a city, two from a
   family;" [85] that is, "If one only come to me from a city he shall
   find an open door; if two only from a tribe come to me, I shall receive
   them." We now apprehend the design of the Prophet.

   Interpreters, indeed, explain one from a city as meaning, that though
   the multitude should perish, yet God would not deny forgiveness to
   three or four; but they teach not what is especially worthy of notice,
   that two or three are mentioned, because this thought, as it has been
   said, might have perplexed them, that is, that they had been all in
   common chosen as a holy people.

   What is here taught may be useful to us in the present day. For we see
   many foolishly excluding themselves from the hope of salvation, and
   seeking no access to God, because they have a regard to one another,
   and the great mass hold them entangled. How is it under the Papacy,
   that so many pertinaciously resist God? even because they think
   themselves safely hid in the multitude. We also find among us that some
   are an hindrance to others. Let this truth be ever remembered, that
   when God stretches forth his arms, he is ready to receive, not only
   all, were they with one consent to come to him, but also two or three,
   even from one city, or from a whole people.

   He adds, I will cause you to come to Zion. This had been once said
   before: God intimates that their exile would be temporary, that the
   Israelites would again be made partakers of his inheritance, if they
   returned to God in sincerity and truth. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [84] Nor is there an instance of such a meaning. Literally it is, "For
   I have been married with (or to) thee." When this verb is followed by
   k, as in Jeremiah 31:32, this is its meaning; but when followed by l,
   as in 1 Chronicles 4:22, it means to rule, to exercise dominion. The
   Vulgate is, "For I am thy husband." The Targum gives the meaning, "For
   I have chosen you." The Septuagint went astray, "For I will rule over
   you." -- Ed

   [85] The word is taken sometimes in a limited sense, and means what we
   understand by family: but it has here evidently a more extended
   meaning, and signifies a tribe, a community; for it includes more than
   a city. Such is its meaning in Jeremiah 8:3; and in Amos 3:1, it
   comprehends the whole community of Israel. It is rendered "ek patrias,
   -- from a tribe," by the Septuagint, but improperly; "kindred," by the
   Vulgate and the Targum It no doubt means sometimes kindred, but not
   evidently in this place. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 3:15

   15. And I will give you pastors according to mine heart, which shall
   feed you with knowledge and understanding.

   15. Et dabo vobis pastores secundum cor meurn, et pascent vos scientia
   et intelligentia (hoc est, scienter et prudenter).


   Here God promises that he would so provide for the salvation of his
   people after their return from exile, that they should not again
   perish. But the cause of God's vengeance ought to be observed, which is
   expressed in the fifth chapter of Isaiah, "My people," he says, "have
   been led captive, because they had no knowledge; therefore the grave
   has widened its soul or its throat. [86] He then says, that the cause
   of the people's ruin was, because instruction had ceased among them,
   and pastors had become mute dogs or robbers. Here, on the other hand,
   God declares that he would give them faithful pastors, who would
   discharge in a befitting manner their office. I, indeed, allow, that
   under this term are included faithful and wise magistrates; but he
   especially refers to prophets and priests, whose office it is in
   particular to reform idolatry. [87]

   We hence learn that the Church cannot continue without having faithful
   pastors to shew the way of salvation. The wellbeing of the Church then
   is secured, when God raises up true and faithful teachers to proclaim
   his truth: but when the Church is deprived of sound teachers, all
   things soon fall into ruin. For God, no doubt, intimates by this
   promise that he would not only be the deliverer of his people, so as to
   restore them from exile, but that he would be also their perpetual
   guardian after the people had returned to their own country. It hence
   follows, that the Church of God is not only begotten by means of holy
   and godly pastors, but that its life is also cherished, nourished, and
   confirmed by them to the end. As it is not enough for civil order to be
   once set up, except the magistrates continue in their office, so
   nothing is more ruinous to the Church than for God to take away
   faithful pastors. It cannot indeed be, that people will return to God,
   unless prophets be first sent: but God speaks here of a continued
   course of instruction, and of a well regulated government in the
   Church, as though he had said, "I will not only give you prophets to
   lead you from your wanderings to me, and to restore you to the way of
   salvation, but I will also continually set over you sound and faithful
   teachers." But we must notice, that those who preside cannot rightly
   discharge their office unless they are endued with wisdom. God also
   intimates his paternal love, when he says, that good pastors would be
   dear to him. It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [86] Rather, "itself;" for the word often rendered soul, has sometimes
   this meaning. See [3]note on Jeremiah 3:11. -- Ed.

   [87] Blayney, following the Targum, renders pastors "rulers," and feed,
   "rule:" but this is to interpret and not to translate, as the words
   have never strictly these meanings, though what are sometimes to be
   understood by pastors are rulers, and by feeding, ruling or governing.
   But the interpretation in this instance seems not to be correct, and
   for the reason here assigned by Calvin It is indeed the opinion of
   Henry, Scott, Adam Clarke, and others, that both civil and
   ecclesiastical pastors are intended; and if so, "knowledge" may be
   applied to the latter, and "wisdom" to the former. The Septuagint have
   omitted "wisdom," and retain only "knowledge." The Targum has
   "knowledge and wisdom;" the Vulgate, "knowledge and doctrine;" the
   Syriac, "knowledge and prudence;" and Blayney, "knowledge and
   discretion." The verb rh means "to feed on," as in Isaiah 44:20, or, as
   here, to "feed with." It means also to "feed itself" as a beast does,
   Isaiah 11:7
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 3:16

   16. And it shall come to pass, when ye be multiplied and increased in
   the land, in those days, saith the LORD, they shall say no more, The
   ark of the covenant of the LORD: neither shall it come to mind: neither
   shall they remember it; neither shall they visit it, neither shall that
   be done any more.

   16. Et erit, cum multiplicati fueritis et fructificaveritis (vel,
   creveritis) in terra diebus illis, dicit Jehova, non dicent amplius,
   Arca foederis Jehovae, et non ascendet in cor, et non recordabuntur
   ejus, et non visitabunt, et non fiet amplius.


   Interpreters have perverted this verse, for none of them have
   understood the design of the Prophet. The Jews, for the most part, have
   adduced frigid and far -- fetched glosses, -- that they would no more
   bring out to battles the Ark of the Covenant, as no enemy would invade
   their land. They think then that a peaceable state is promised to the
   people, as they would be constrained by no hostile force to carry the
   Ark of the Covenant here and there. But we clearly see that the words
   mean no such thing: it is then a comment wholly foreign to the subject.
   Others say, that what is said must be applied to the time of the
   Messiah, and none even of the Jews deny this; for it afterwards
   follows, that the Israelites would return with the tribe of Judah. This
   had not yet been fulfilled; it hence follows, that the Prophet here
   predicts of the kingdom of Christ. But the Jews, while allowing this,
   do not understand that anything is said of the abrogation of legal
   ceremonies; it has yet been thought by almost all Christians, that the
   Prophet here teaches us, that when Christ should come, an end would be
   put to all the shadows of the law, so that there would be no more any
   Ark of the Covenant, as the fullness of the Godhead would dwell in
   Christ.

   This indeed is a view which seems plausible, but the meaning of the
   Prophet, as I think, is wholly different: for he refers here to that
   divorce or division which had for a long time existed between the
   kingdom of Judah and the kingdom of Israel. Though the kingdom of
   Israel, as to the number of its men, largeness of territory and wealth,
   was more flourishing and prosperous than the kingdom of Judah; yet
   there remained these advantages to the Jews, -- that they had a Temple
   built according to God's command, -- that its place had been chosen by
   God, -- that they had the Ark of the Covenant as a symbol of God's
   presence. Hence there was contention between the kingdom of Judah and
   the ten tribes: the Israelites were elated on account of their number
   and their riches, and other temporal advantages; and the Jews gloried
   in their Temple and the Ark of the Covenant. And what now does the
   Prophet say? He declares that such would be the concord between the
   Israelites and the Jews, that the Jews would no more say, "The Ark of
   the Covenant," "The Temple of God;" for God would be present with them
   all. And the Prophet proceeds to confirm more fully what I have just
   said: it is therefore necessary to add the two following verses. He
   then says --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 3:17-18

   17. At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the LORD; and
   all the nations shall be gathered unto it, to the name of the LORD, to
   Jerusalem: neither shall they walk any more after the imagination of
   their evil heart.

   17. Tempore illo vocabunt Jerusalem solium Jehovae, et congregabuntur
   ad eam omnes gentes ad nomen Jehovae, Jerusalem dico; et non ambulabunt
   posthac (vel, amplius) post duriciem (alii vertunt, obstinationem; est
   etiam interdum cogitatio, srrvt, post duriciem) cordis sui malam.

   18. In those days the house of Judah shall walk with the house of
   Israel, and they shall come together out of the land of the north to
   the land that I have given for an inheritance unto your fathers.

   18. In diebus illis venient domus Jehudah cum domo Israel, venient
   simul e terra aquilonis ad terram, quam dedi in haereditatem patribus
   vestris (vel, quam dedi possidendam jure haereditario patribus
   vestris.)


   We now understand more clearly what I have already said, -- that the
   Prophet promises here that there would be concord between the ten
   tribes and the kingdom of Judah, when both returned from exile; as
   though he had said, that their condition would be better than it ever
   had been; for the seed of Abraham had been torn as it were asunder; and
   the people whom God intended that they should continue in a holy union
   had become divided in the most shameful manner. We indeed know that
   there had been inveterate hatred between the Jews and the Israelites.
   As then there had been such disgraceful division for a long time
   between the children of Abraham, the Prophet now shews what would be
   the fruit of exile; for after having been for a time chastised by the
   Lord, they would return to their own country, not to entertain the same
   emulation as had existed, but to unite together in calling on God, in
   order that the Jews might be as brethren to the Israelites, and the
   Israelites might cultivate mutual concord with the tribe of Judah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou at this day mercifully sparest us,
   when yet in various ways we provoke thy displeasure, -- O grant, that
   we may not harden ourselves against thy chastisements, but that thy
   forbearance may lead us to repentance, and that also thy scourges may
   do us good, and that we may so truly turn to thee, that our whole life
   may testify that we are in our hearts changed; and may we also
   stimulate one another, that we may unite together in rendering
   obedience to thy word, and each of us strive to glorify thy name,
   through Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture Thirteenth

   WE began yesterday to explain what the Prophet means, when he says,
   that there would be no more a remembrance of the Ark of the Covenant
   after the return of the Israelites into their country and their
   increase in it, even because there would be no discord among them as
   there had been before they were led into exile. For the ten tribes, we
   know, worshipped God after their own manner, as they had departed from
   the pure and simple teaching of the law. The Prophet then means, that
   they would all be the worshippers of the only true God, and that there
   would be among them such an unity of faith, that the Jew would not call
   God his God only, and that an Israelite would not desire for himself
   another God. Hence he adds, It shall not ascend on the heart; that is,
   such a thought shall no more come into their minds; and they shall not
   remember it; that is, no monuments of their ancient disunion shall
   exist any more among them; and they shall not visit it, which means,
   they shall no more come stealthily into Jerusalem who may wish to offer
   sacrifices to God; and in short, he says, No such thing shall be done
   [88]

   Then he says, At that time called shall be Jerusalem the throne of
   Jehovah The Prophet may appear inconsistent with himself by saying that
   Jerusalem would be the throne of God, and yet that the Jews would make
   no mention of the Ark of the Covenant: but the two clauses wholly
   agree, for he means that Jerusalem would be the seat and habitation of
   the eternal God, without any dispute being raised among them. The
   Israelites before their exile boasted that they retained the worship of
   the true God, and so magnificent was the display, and so great the
   pomp, that Jerusalem was quite obscure as to any external splendor. But
   the Prophet says that this distinction would no longer exist, and that
   the Israelites would no more contend with the Jews, for all would allow
   Jerusalem to be the sanctuary of God; as though he had said, "Pure
   religion shall flourish among them all without exception, such as had
   not done before." And this passage he more clearly confirms by the
   words which follow: --

   Assemble into it shall all nations to the name of Jehovah; or, on
   account of the name of Jehovah (l, lamed, is here instead of a causal
   particle) shall all nations assemble at Jerusalem. [89] We see that
   there is nothing doubtful in these words, for the Prophet distinctly
   declares, that the worship of God, such as the Law required, would
   attain such esteem, that all nations would be ready to embrace whatever
   would be taught by the Jews. But by all nations we are to understand
   strictly the ten tribes, as they are called many nations in several
   places. If any one prefers to extend the meaning, let him enjoy his own
   opinion.

   As I have said yesterday, the Jews think that the time of the Messiah
   is described here, because what Jeremiah promises has never been
   fulfilled; for there was no assembling of nations when the Jews
   returned from exile to their own country, as the Jews alone returned at
   that time. Hence they conclude that this passage can be explained in no
   other way than by referring it to the kingdom of Messiah; which,
   indeed, I confess to be true. But as that return and restoration of the
   people was a prelude of Christ's kingdom, the prophets ever begin at
   that time whenever they prophesy of the Church being renewed. It is
   indeed true, that the restoration of the whole world was to be looked
   for through the coming of Christ; yet God began to restore his Church,
   when he stretched forth his hand to the Jews, and when they built the
   city and the temple; which was necessary to be done before Christ came
   forth. But as to this passage, whether by nations we understand the ten
   tribes, or both kingdoms, or all nations indiscriminately, the meaning
   of the Prophet is equally clear, which is this, -- that the Church
   would become larger than before, when God restored the people, and that
   God would then cause true religion to flourish, unaccompanied with envy
   and strife.

   What follows confirms the opinion, that the passage is to be explained
   of the two kingdoms, Walk, he says, shall they no more after the evil
   hardness of their own heart [90] It was not usual to speak thus of
   heathen nations, who had ever been strangers to the teaching of the
   Law. As this, then, can only be specifically applied to the Jews and
   Israelites, that explanation is the most to be approved, which makes
   all nations to mean the ten tribes, or the whole people.

   Then is added, what is of the same meaning, In those days shall come
   the house of Judah with the house of Israel It hence appears, that the
   Prophet speaks of the posterity of Abraham and not of other nations;
   for he adds this verse as explanatory. It might, indeed, have been
   asked, "What does this mean, All nations shall come?" To this he
   answers, "The house of Israel shall unite with the house of Judah;"
   that is, there shall be no more hatred between these two nations, for
   they shall acknowledge one another as brethren, and know that they have
   arisen from the same source, and that they ought to be one people. In
   short, the Prophet explains in this verse what he had said before. And
   we ought especially to notice what he adds, Come shall they together
   from the land of the north into the land which I have given to be
   possessed by their fathers The Jews had not yet gone into exile; the
   Prophet said this to them while they were quiet, as it were, in their
   own nest at Jerusalem, and in the country around; nor could he convince
   them of what they afterwards found to be true to their great loss, --
   that an exile was nigh them, like that which they then saw had happened
   to their brethren, the Israelites. But yet the Prophet spoke of them,
   as though they had been exiled and dwelt like the Israelites in the
   north country; Come together , he says, shall they from the land of the
   north [91]

   They might have objected and said, "We are as yet enjoying our own
   inheritance, and no one can drive us hence, for it cannot be that God
   shall be deprived of his own temple, as he has chosen for himself a
   perpetual habitation among us." Such words were no doubt clamorously
   spoken by them. But the Prophet here repels their vain confidence, and
   says, that their only hope of deliverance was in looking forward to the
   restoration which the Lord would grant them after they had been for a
   time banished from their country. Now the Prophet here sets forth to
   them the benefit which would arise from exile, in order that they might
   bear with more submission the punishment they were to endure: for they
   might have a hundred times despaired, had they no hope that this exile
   would be only for a time, and that they would again be gathered
   together with their brethren the Israelites. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [88] The literal rendering of this verse I conceive to be the
   following, -- 16. And it shall be, that ye shall multiply And be
   fruitful in the land. In those days, saith Jehovah, they shall no more
   say, -- "The Ark of the Covenant of Jehovah;" And it shall not come to
   their mind, Nor shall they mention it, nor visit it; And not made shall
   it be any more. The two first lines seem connected with the former
   verse. There is a gradation in the three last lines, -- It shall not be
   thought of, much less mentioned or named, as given by the Septuagint,
   -- still less be visited, -- and much less still, be made. This
   gradation is destroyed by Blayney by rendering the first line, Nor
   shall it be the delight of their heart; literally it is, "And it shall
   not ascend on the heart." The "heart" means often in Hebrew the mind;
   and "to come to mind" is the idea; it would not be thought of. The
   phrase occurs in this book in two other places, Jeremiah 7:31; Jeremiah
   44:21; and, not to think, or, not to come to mind, is the most suitable
   meaning, as it is given in our version. The purpose of this kind of
   gradation is to render the thing more certain and indisputable, so that
   there might be no room for doubt. -- Ed.

   [89] This seems to be the best rendering. Blayney leaves out the word
   "Jerusalem;" but for no sufficient reason. The whole verse is as
   follows: -- In that day call shall they Jerusalem, "The throne of
   Jehovah;" And gathered into it shall be all the nations, For the name
   of Jehovah, even to Jerusalem; And they shall no more walk after the
   resolutions of their wicked heart. -- Ed.

   [90] "Evil" is connected with "hardness;" but it belongs properly to
   "their heart." The word rendered "hardness" is srrvt a plural noun,
   found eight times in Jeremiah; here, and in Jeremiah 7:24; Jeremiah
   9:14; Jeremiah 11:8; Jeremiah 13:10; Jeremiah 16:12; Jeremiah 18:12;
   Jeremiah 23:17; and twice elsewhere, Deuteronomy 29:19; Psalm 81:12. It
   is so variously rendered by the Septuagint, that they evidently did not
   understand its specific meaning; enthumemata, thoughts, devices; ta
   aresta, things pleasing or agreeable; plane, wandering. These words are
   used for it in Jeremiah. The Vulgate ever renders it "pravitas --
   pravity -- wickedness." The Targum uniformly renders it "cogitatio --
   thought or imagination." The latter word is used in our version,
   (except in Psalm 81:12, "lust,") with a marginal reading
   "stubbornness." The Syriac and Arabic vary as much as the Septuagint,
   "appetites, lusts, will," etc. To "walk after" precedes it in most
   instances except in Jeremiah 18:12, where it is preceded by "doing."
   Now to "do the hardness of the heart," is no suitable expression; nor
   is "imagination" or "stubbornness" anything better. It can be derived
   from no verb which means to think or to imagine, or which has any
   connection with depravity or wickedness, or with appetites or lusts.
   Nor can we derive it from srh, which those do who render it
   "stubbornness;" for that will suit the passage referred to in Jeremiah
   18:12. It must then come from sr, to direct, to regulate, to rule, to
   exercise authority. It occurs three times in a reduplicate form; as a
   participial noun in Esther 1:22, and as a verb and a participle in
   Hithpael in Numbers 16:13, where it is applied in the sense of making
   oneself a prince or a tyrant. The literal meaning of the noun then is,
   in the plural number, predominances, domineerings, arbitraments; and it
   may be rendered determinations, resolutions, predominant influences or
   inclinations. "Walk shall they no more after the resolutions of their
   wicked heart." It is used in Jeremiah 7:24, in apposition with
   "counsels," being evidently a stronger word: it seems to mean
   resoluteness or resolvedness, a full determination, a willful decision.
   Parkhurst renders it, "the ruling principles." -- Ed

   [91] Calvin uses the verb "venient, "shall come, twice: but the first
   verb is to walk, and expresses the associating of Judah with Israel, or
   their union. The words are, -- In those days walk will the house of
   Judah with the house of Israel, And come shall they together from the
   land of the north, To the land which I made their fathers to inherit.
   They would be first united, and then advance together to their own
   land. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 3:19

   19. But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, and give thee
   a pleasant land, a goodly heritage of the hosts of nations? and I said,
   Thou shalt call me, My father; and shalt not turn away from me.

   19. Et ego dixi, Quomodo ponam to in filios, et dabo tibi terram
   desiderii (hoc est, desiderabilem,) haereditatem cupiditatis [92] (hoc
   est, quae concupiscitur,) exercitus gentium? Et dixi, Pater mi,
   clamabis ad me, et a me non recedes (de post me, ad verbtum, m'chry.)


   It is not my purpose to mention all the expositions of this verse; but
   it is enough to shew what seems to be the meaning of the Prophet.
   Whenever I touch on opinions which I disapprove, this I feel
   constrained to do, because when they present the appearance of truth,
   readers may be deceived by them: but when the truth itself is
   sufficiently conspicuous, I am not disposed to spend labor in refuting
   the opinions of others.

   What, then, the words of the Prophet mean is this, -- God here asks,
   How was it possible that the race of Abraham could again be propagated
   since it was nearly dead? The answer is, It shall be, when thou wilt
   call me Father, and turn not away from me The question was asked, that
   the Jews might feel as though their condition was past remedy. And
   doubtless, since they had so greatly and so obstinately provoked God by
   their wickedness, they might have seemed to have become wholly lost.
   God then assumes here the character of one filled with astonishment, as
   though he had said, "Ye are, indeed, in a state of despair, there is no
   hope of your salvation; but yet, as it is my purpose again to restore
   you, I wish now to find out a way, by which your race may again be
   propagated." How, then, is this to be done? He shews that the only
   thing required was, to call him Father, not with the mouth, but really
   with the heart.

   We now, then, perceive the meaning of the Prophet: for he humbles the
   Israelites by thus ascribing astonishment to God, as though it was a
   thing very difficult to be done; but at the same time he gives them
   hope, because salvation was prepared for them, provided they called on
   God with a sincere heart, and acknowledged him as their Father, and
   that perseveringly, without ever turning aside from him. In short, God
   intimates that the Israelites were like dead men, and that their
   salvation was hopeless, without a resurrection, he yet promises them
   salvation on this condition, -- that they called on him and did this,
   not with a double heart, nor by a sudden impulse, such as soon vanishes
   away; for he says, Thou shalt not turn aside from me; that is, "Be
   always obedient to me, and I will prove that I shall not be called in
   vain a Father by you." It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [92] Calvin takes the word in its Chaldee meaning; tsvy means in
   Hebrew, elation, splendor, glory; but in Chaldee, desire, what is
   desired; and this suits the passage best, "The inheritance of desire to
   hosts of nations;" that is, "The inheritance desired by hosts of
   nations;" This is the meaning preferred by Gataker I would render the
   whole verse thus, -- 19. But I, said have I, "How shall I put thee
   among the children, And give thee the land of delight, The inheritance
   desired by hosts of nations?" Said have I also, "My Father shalt thou
   call me, And from me thou wilt not turn away." When the pronouns are
   given before verbs in Hebrew, as 'nky I, here, they are ever
   emphatical. "But I," or, "as for me," or, "even I have said." -- Ed

   Jeremiah 3:20

   20. Surely as a wife treacherously departeth from her husband, so have
   ye dealt treacherously with me, O house of Israel, saith the LORD.

   20. Certe (subaudienda est particula sicut) perfideagit mulier a socio
   suo [93] (hoc est, perfide agit cum marito, ubi ab ipso discedit, vel,
   se alienat,) sic perfide egistis in me, domus Israel, inquit Jehovah.


   He confirms the first clause of the preceding verse: for he had said
   that it could hardly be that the Jews would recover what they had lost,
   and be formed again a new people; and he shews the reason, -- because
   they were like an adulteress, as he had before stated. But he did not
   yet wish to take away every hope; only he insists on this, that they
   were seriously to consider their sins, in order that they might become
   displeased with themsalves, and flee to God's mercy for refuge. Nor did
   he do this so much for their sake, as for the sake of the people among
   whom he dwelt. For he had respect, as it has been often stated,
   especially to the Jews, who had become so hardened in their vices as
   not to think that this example, by which God intended to terrify them,
   so as to bend their hard hearts to repentance, belonged to them. Hence
   it was for this reason that God so severely reproved Israel; for he had
   said before, that the Jews were still worse. He afterwards subjoins --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [93] Blayney, contrary to all the early versions, construes the word
   mrh with woman, "a wicked woman." "Friend," or associate, or partner,
   is here evidently put for husband; a thing commonly done in other
   languages. Our common version of this verse is by no means correct: the
   preposition m is not always "from," but sometimes "with." So here, --
   Surely, as a woman deals perfidiously with her partner,
   So perfidiously against me have ye dealt,
   O house of Israel, saith Jehovah. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 3:21

   21. A voice was heard upon the high places, weeping and supplications
   of the children of Israel: for they have perverted their way, and they
   have forgotten the LORD their God.

   21. Vox super excelsa audita est, fletus precationum filiorum Israel;
   quia perverterunt viam suam, obliti sunt Jehovae Dei sui.


   What I have stated becomes now more evident, -- that the case of the
   Israelites is here set before the Jews, that the perverse, whom God had
   spared, might know that the same punishment impended over them, except
   they returned in due time to him: for the Prophet declares, that the
   Israelites were weeping and in tears, because they had departed from
   their God, and violated their faith pledged to him. For what purpose
   did he do this? That the Jews, who indulged themselves in their own
   pleasures, might be awakened, and be convinced, that except they
   anticipated God's judgments, the same tears and the same weeping were
   prepared for them. The Israelites, indeed, did not as yet thus weep and
   shew signs of true repentance; for the Prophet does not here commend
   their feeling or their piety, but intimates, that they were thus
   severely afflicted, because they had forsaken their God.

   A voice, he says, was heard on high places, that is, It was everywhere
   sufficiently known how cruelly the Israelites were oppressed by their
   enemies. Now they cried, then they called themselves the most wretched
   of men: why was this lamentation? Because they had perverted their ways
   It is, then, the same as though he had said, -- that it was a monstrous
   perverseness in the Jews, that being warned by the punishment of their
   brethren, they did not repent: for the calamity which happened to the
   Israelites filled all men with terror. That kingdom had, indeed,
   flourished for a long time; but the land had been emptied of its
   inhabitants, and was occupied by wild beasts, until some were sent from
   Persia and other parts in the East to cultivate it. How could a land so
   pleasant and so fruitful have become like a desert? Even because God
   had so predicted:

   "Ye have neglected," he says, "my Sabbaths, and your land shall rest,
   and it shall no more be wearied by you."
   (Leviticus 26:34, 35.)

   It was an awful sight; and nations, far and wide, were able to see how
   great must have been the impiety of that people, on whom God had taken
   such dreadful vengeance. Were not the Jews, who had this solitude
   before their eyes, and this devastation of the land, extremely stupid
   in overlooking all this?

   We now see the design of the Prophet, when he says, A voice on high
   places was heard, as though the Israelites cried on the tops of
   mountains. And he adds, the weeping of the supplications, etc.: but he
   does not mean, that they were prayers which arose from faith; but
   simply that they were such lamentations as betokened misery and
   wretchedness. In giving a reason, the Prophet mentions not what the
   Israelites confessed, but only shews the cause why they so deeply
   deplored their calamities; it was, because they had perverted their
   ways, and forgotten Jehovah their God [94] He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [94] The verse may be thus rendered, -- 21. A voice on the high places!
   Heard is the weeping, the supplications Of the people of Israel;
   Because they had perverted their way, Had forgotten Jehovah their God.
   Instead of "high places," Blayney has "plains;" but there is no
   satisfactory reason for the change. As the verb in Hebrew commonly
   precedes its nominative, the construction adopted above is the most
   suitable to the character of the language. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 3:22-23

   22. Return, ye backsliding children, and I will heal your backslidings.
   Behold, we come unto thee; for thou art the LORD our God.

   22. Revertimini, filii rebelles; sanabo transgressiones vestras. Ecce,
   nos venimus ad to, quia Jehova Deus noster.

   23. Truly in vain is salvation hoped for from the hills, and from the
   multitude of mountains: truly in the LORD our God is the salvation of
   Israel.

   23. Certe fallacia a collibus, multitudo montium; certe in Jehova Deo
   nostro sans Israel.


   God here exhorts the Israelites to repent, that by their example he
   might move the Jews. The benefit of what is here taught might indeed
   have reached to the miserable captives and exiles; but as Jeremiah was
   especially the teacher of his own nation, he labored chiefly no doubt
   for their advantage, as we have before stated. God then here declares,
   that he would be reconcilable to the Israelites, how grievously soever
   they had sinned, he afterwards introduces them as answering, Behold, we
   return, or we shall come to thee: for the Prophet speaks here of the
   future conversion of the ten tribes.

   It is then a dialogue between God and the Israelites. God himself
   freely invites them to repent: Return, he says, ye rebellious children;
   and then he promises to be a physician to heal their diseases: I will
   heal thy transgressions; that is, I will blot out thy sins, and absolve
   thee from guilt. God then undertakes to do these things; first, to
   stimulate the Israelites to repentance, and then to give them the hope
   of pardon: and he says that a remedy was provided for them, except they
   hardened themselves. Now, the Israelites, on the other hand, make this
   answer, Behold, we shall come to thee Here Jeremiah condemns the
   obstinacy of his own nation, by saying, that the Israelites, when thus
   kindly invited by God, would not be perverse, but would, on the
   contrary, be tractable and obedient. This indeed was not fulfilled,
   when a liberty to return was given to the people, except in the case of
   a few, who had a right feeling, and preferred the glory of God to their
   temporal advantages. But the number was small; nor was it a matter of
   surprise; for God had not previously said, without reason, that if one
   came from a city, and two from a tribe, he would be received, though
   others continued fixed in their perverseness. However this may have
   been, God here intimates that the Israelites would not be so refractory
   as not to obey his admonition when the hope of pardon and salvation
   would be presented to them: and this is mentioned, that the
   perverseness of the Jews might appear more detestable.

   But some think that the Israelites are here upbraided, because they
   hypocritically pretended that they always sought God. Hence they elicit
   this meaning, "Ye indeed say, Behold, we return to thee, thou art our
   God;" as though he condemned their hypocrisy, because they falsely
   alleged that they always sought him. But this view seems to me foreign
   to the intention of the Prophet. Hence I doubt not but that Jeremiah
   sets before the Jews, as in a picture, what ought to have constrained
   them not to persist so obstinately in their sinful courses: "Behold,"
   he says, "God is prepared to receive into favor your brethren, who are
   undone and past all hope; and when they shall hear God's voice kindly
   and graciously inviting them to himself, they will doubtless return:
   why then do not ye obey?"

   And in the same sense is to be taken what follows, Surely, deceit is
   from the hills, and the multitude of mountains, or, from the multitude
   of mountains, as the letter m is to be repeated. Here the Prophet more
   fully expresses the evidence of their repentance, as though he had
   said, "We have been deceived by the hills and the multitude of
   mountains; we thought that there would be more defense from a large
   number of gods than if we worshipped one God: this deception has led to
   ruin. Let then all these deceits be now discarded; for we shall be
   content with the only true God." In short, the Israelites confess, in
   these words, that they had been drawn into ruin by the worst of errors,
   while they sought many gods, and did not acquiesce in the one true God.

   Then they add, for surely in Jehovah our God is salvation They set here
   the one true God in opposition to all their idols, as though they had
   said, that the cause of all their evils was, that they did not continue
   in the service of the one true God, but wandered after a multitude of
   Gods. We hence see that these two things cannot possibly be connected,
   -- to worship the true God, -- and to seek for ourselves various other
   gods, and to form vain hopes, as they do, who are not satisfied with
   the only true God. [95] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [95] The literal rendering of these two verses is the following:- 22.
   Return, ye apostate children, I will heal your apostasies. -- Behold
   us! We come to thee; For thou art Jehovah our God: 23. Surely, in vain
   are the hills, The multitude of mountains; Surely, in (or through)
   Jehovah our God Is the salvation of Israel. The word rendered
   "apostate," does not mean "rebellious," but such as turn away, i.e.,
   from God; and the word for "apostasies" means the same, being from the
   same root. The m before the word for "hills," is not a preposition, as
   it is commonly taken, but a formative: so it appears from all the
   versions. Blayney conjectures that it belongs to the former word, and
   makes it lsqrym; but then he does not account for the l prefixed to it.
   There is no different reading. The Septuagint is, eis pseudos hesan hoi
   zounoi -- for a lie were the hills. The Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic,
   are materially the same. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 3:24

   24. For shame hath devoured the labour of our fathers from our youth;
   their flocks and their herds, their sons and their daughters.

   24. Et pudor (vel, probrum) voravit laborem patrum nostrorum a pueritia
   nostra, oves eorum et pecora eorum, filios eorum et filias eorum.


   They confirm more fully the same complaint, -- That God had by manifest
   proofs shewed the sins of the nation; for he had consumed their labor,
   that is, whatever they had acquired by labor. He also adds sheep and
   cattle, and then sons and daughters He does not indeed ascribe this
   consumption to God; but the mode of speaking is more emphatic, when he
   says, Shame has consumed the labor of our fathers from our childhood:
   for by shame he understands wickedness, of which they ought to have
   been ashamed. The meaning then is, that all the evils they had endured
   could in no other way be accounted for, inasmuch as the whole was to be
   ascribed to their wickedness. Our shame, then, [96] that is, our
   wickedness, has consumed the labor of our fathers It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [96] Rather, "And the shame," i e , the idol-worship, referred to in
   the preceding verse; the article h is prefixed to the noun. This is the
   view taken by Gataker and Blayney See Jeremiah 11:13; Hosea 9:10. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 3:25

   25. We lie down in our shame, and our confusion covereth us: for we
   have sinned against the LORD our God, we and our fathers, from our
   youth even unto this day, and have not obeyed the voice of the LORD our
   God.

   25. Jacuimus in pudore nostro, et operuit nos ignomina nostra; quoniam
   cum Jehova Deo nostro scelerate egimus, nos et patres nostri, a
   pueritia nostra, et ad hunc diem usque; et non audivimus vocem Jehovae
   Dei nostri.


   As the Israelites say here nothing new, but continue the same subject,
   I propose only to touch briefly on the words, lest I should be too
   tedious. They say then that they were lying in their miseries; and why?
   because they had dealt wickedly with God We see that they are
   explaining what they had confessed, -- even that the labor of their
   fathers had been consumed by their shame, that is, by their wickedness;
   and they ascribe to themselves what might have been put to the account
   of their fathers, because they knew that they were heirs to their
   iniquity. We have lain, they say, in our shame [97] They here shortly
   confess that they were deservedly miserable, that they could not accuse
   God of cruelty, as that he afflicted them too severely. How so? because
   they were lying in their own shame, and their own disgrace covered
   them; as though they said, that the cause of all their evils was to be
   found in their sins, and that it was not to be sought anywhere else.

   Because we and our fathers, they say, have done wickedly By these words
   they intimate that they had acted thus, not for a day only, but had
   been so perverse, that from early life they had imbibed the iniquity of
   their fathers, and thus added evils to evils. They had said before,
   that the labor of their fathers had been consumed from their childhood,
   thereby signifying the continuance of their punishment; for God had not
   for a day chastised them, but had often repeated his scourges, and yet
   without any benefit. Now they add, "As we have from our childhood dealt
   wickedly towards our God, so also he has warned us from our childhood
   to return to him; and it has been our fault that we have not returned,
   for he called us; but as we were obstinate, so also God has justly
   executed on us his vengeance."

   They afterwards say, even to this day; by which they confirm what I
   have already stated, -- that they had been so perverse as not to cease
   from their vices. At the same time he points out the source of all
   their wickedness: they hearkened not to the voice of Jehovah Had they
   gone astray, and had God been silent, their fault might have been
   extenuated; but as God had daily sent prophets to them, who never
   ceased to cry in their hearing, and yet they continued deaf, their
   perverseness in their sinful courses was inexcusable. We then see that
   their sin was increased by the circumstance, that they refused to hear
   the voice of God; as though he had said, that God had done his part in
   calling them back from the way of ruin, but that they had been so
   obstinate as to disregard his favor, and that they thus justly
   suffered, not only for their impiety, but also for their ingratitude
   and perverse wickedness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [97] Calvin seems to have followed the Septuagint in rendering the verb
   in the past tense. The Vulgate and Syriac retain the future of the
   original; but the Targum gives the present, and rightly so, as the
   future in Hebrew is often to be so taken. It is the same in Welsh, the
   future conveys the meaning of the present. This distich might in that
   language be rendered exactly according to the Hebrew, and the future
   would be understood as expressing what the present state of things is,
   -- Gorweddwn yn ein cywilydd, A gorchuddia ni ein gwarth. But in
   English the present must be used, as it is the confession of the
   penitent when returning to God, -- We lie in our shame, And cover us
   does our disgrace, Because against Jehovah our God Have we sinned, we
   and our fathers, From our childhood even to this day; And we have not
   hearkened To the voice of Jehovah our God. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we cease not, though favored with many
   blessings, to provoke thee by our misdeeds, as though we avowedly
   carried on war against thee, -- O grant, that we being at length warned
   by those examples, by which thou invitest us to repentance, may
   restrain our depraved nature, and in due time repent, and so devote
   ourselves to thy service, that thy name through us may be glorified,
   and that we may strive to bring into the way of salvation those who
   seem to be now lost, so that thy mercy may extend far and wide, and
   that thus thy salvation, obtained through Christ thine only -- begotten
   Son, may be known and embraced by all nations. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 4:1

   1. If thou wilt return, O Israel, saith the Lord, return unto me: and
   if thou wilt put away thine abominations out of my sight, then shalt
   thou not remove.

   1. Si reverteris Israel, dicit Jehova, ad me revertere (vel, apud me
   quiesce;) et si abstuleris abominationes tuas a facie mea, et non
   fueris vagus (alii, et non migrabis.)


   The Prophet no doubt requires here from the people a sincere return to
   God, inasmuch as they had often pretended to confess their sins, and
   had given many signs of repentance, while they were acting deceitfully
   with him. As then they had often dealt falsely with God and with his
   prophets, Jeremiah bids them to return to God without any disguise and
   in good faith. With regard to what is here substantially taught, this
   is the Prophet's meaning; but there is some ambiguity in the words.

   Some read thus, "If thou returnest, Israel, to me, saith Jehovah,
   "connecting "to me, 'ly, "with the first clause, then they read
   separately "tsvv, teshub, thou shalt rest;" and so they think that what
   follows is the repetition of the same thing, "If thou wilt take away
   thine abominations from before me, thou shalt not migrate;" that is, I
   will not cast thee out as I have threatened. Others take the verb tsvv,
   teshub, in the same sense, (for it is the same verb repeated,) "If thou
   wilt return, Israel, return to me." The Prophet doubtless bids the
   Israelites to return to God in sincerity, and without any disguise, and
   not to act falsely with him, as they had often done.

   I have as yet mentioned only what others have thought; but, in my
   judgment, the most suitable rendering is, "If thou wilt return, Israel,
   rest in me, "arrete toi, as we say in French. Rest then in me; and then
   a definition is given, If thou wilt take away thine abominations (for
   the copulative is to be taken as expletive or explanatory) from my
   sight, and wilt not wander What some of those I have referred to have
   given as their rendering, "If thou wilt return to me, Israel, thou
   shalt rest," I wholly reject, as it seems forced: but I allow this
   reading, "If thou wilt return, Israel, thou shalt rest in me;" or this,
   "If thou wilt return, Israel, return to me;" for the difference is not
   great. The Prophet here evidently condemns the hypocrisy which the
   Israelites had practiced; for they had often professed themselves as
   ready to render obedience to God, and afterwards proved that they had
   made a false profession. Since then deceit and emptiness had been so
   often found in them, the Prophet demands here, in the name and by the
   command of God, that they should in truth and sincerity return to him.

   If this reading be approved, "Israel, return to me," the intimation is,
   that they ever took circuitous courses, that they might not return
   directly to God: for it is usual with hypocrites to make a great show
   of repentance and at the same time to shun God. If then we follow this
   reading, the Prophet means this, "Israel, there is no reason for thee
   hereafter to think that thou gainest anything by boasting with thy
   mouth of thy repentance; return to me; know that thou hast to do with
   God, who is not deceived, as he never deceives any: return then
   faithfully to me, and let thy conversion be sincere and in no way
   deceptive."

   But if the verb, tsvv, teshub, be taken in the other sense, there would
   be no great difference in the meaning; "If thou wilt return, Israel,
   thou shalt rest in me;" that is, thou shalt hereafter have nothing to
   do with idols and with thy perverted ways. Thus the Prophet briefly
   shews that the return of Israel would be nothing, except they
   acquiesced in God alone, and wandered not after vain objects, as they
   had often done. And with this view corresponds what follows, "Even if
   thou takest away (for the copulative, as I have said, is to be taken as
   explanatory) thine abominations from my sight, and wilt wander no more,
   vl' tnvd, vela tanud." For the vice which Jeremiah meant especially to
   condemn was this, -- that Israel, while pretending a great show of
   religion, yet vacillated and did not devote themselves with all their
   heart to God, but were changeable in their purpose. This vice then is
   what Jeremiah justly condemns; and hence I am disposed to embrace this
   view "Israel, if thou wilt return, rest in me;" that is, continue
   constantly faithful to me: but how can this be done? "Even if thou wilt
   take away thy abominations, and if thou wilt not wander;" for thy
   levity and inconstancy hitherto has been well known. [98]

   Whatever view we may take, this passage deserves to be noticed as being
   against hypocrites, who dare not openly to reject prophetic warnings;
   but while they shew some tokens of repentance, they still by windings
   shun the presence of God. They indeed testify by their mouth that they
   seek God, but yet have recourse to subterfuges: and hence I have said
   that this passage is remarkably useful, so that we may know that God
   cannot be pacified by those fallacious trifles which hypocrites bring
   forward, but that he requires a sincere heart, and that he abominates
   all dissimulation. It is therefore expressly said, If thou wilt take
   away thy abominations from my sight For hypocrites ever regard display
   and seek to be approved by men, and are satisfied with their
   approbation; but God calls their attention to himself. It must at the
   same time be observed, that he cannot be deceived; for he is the
   searcher of hearts. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [98] The best rendering is that which connects "to me" with the former
   clause: the end of the verse, as Grotius observes, proves this. If they
   returned to God, they were to return from captivity; and if they cast
   away their abominations, they were not to be vagabonds or to wander any
   more. This seems to be the meaning. The v before l' in the last clause
   is left out in ten MSS., and in the Vulgate, Targum, and Syriac. The
   verse then would be as follows, -- 1. If thou wilt return, Israel,
   saith Jehovah, to me, Thou shalt be restored, (that is, from
   captivity:) If thou wilt remove thy abominations from my sight, Thou
   shalt not be a wanderer. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 4:2

   2 And thou shalt swear, The Lord liveth, in truth, in judgment, and in
   righteousness; and the nations shall bless themselves in him, and in
   him shall they glory.

   2. Et jurabis, vivit Jehova, in veritate, in judicio et in justitia; et
   benedicent se in eo gentes et in eo gloriabuntur.


   Here the Prophet goes on with the same subject; for he denudes these
   flatteries, by which they thought that God could be pacified: for when
   they had his name in their mouth, they thought it sufficient for their
   defense, -- "What! do we not call upon God? do we not ascribe to him
   his due honor, when we swear by his name?" There is in the Prophet's
   words a part given for the whole; for swearing is to be taken for the
   whole of God's worship. When therefore the Israelites made a profession
   of God's name, they thought themselves absolved from all guilt.

   Hence the Prophet says, Thou shalt swear truly in the name of God; that
   is, "Ye are indeed self -- confident, because an external profession of
   religion seems to you to be a sort of expiation, whenever ye seek to
   contend with God: ye boast that you are Abraham's seed, and swear by
   the name of God; but ye are sacrilegious, when ye thus falsely profess
   God's name." Swear then, he says, in truth

   We hence see how the words of the Prophet harmonize together: he had
   said, that Israel had hitherto dealt falsely with God, because they had
   not performed what in words they had promised, for they went astray;
   and now he adds, that it availed the Israelites nothing, that they
   openly called on God and shewed themselves to be his people by an
   external worship: this, he says, is nothing, except ye worship God in
   truth and in judgment and in righteousness

   Truth is no doubt to be taken here for integrity, as we shall see in
   the fifth chapter: it is the same as though he had said, that God is
   not rightly worshipped, except when the heart is free from all guile
   and deceit; in short, he means that there is no worship of God without
   sincerity of heart. But the truth, of which the Prophet speaks, is
   especially known by judgment and righteousness; that is, when men deal
   faithfully with one another, and render to all their right, and seek
   not their own gain at the expense of others. When therefore equity and
   uprightness are thus observed by men, then is fulfilled what is
   required here by the Prophet: for then they worship not God
   fallaciously, nor with vain words, but really shew that they do,
   without disguise, fear and reverence God.

   What follows is variously explained by interpreters; but the Prophet, I
   have no doubt, does here indirectly reprove the Israelites, because
   God's name had been exposed to many reproaches and mockeries, when the
   heathens said, that there was no power in God to help the Israelites,
   and when the people themselves expostulated with God, as though they
   had a just cause for contending with him, -- "What! God has promised
   that we should be models of his blessing; but we are exposed to the
   reproaches of the heathens: how can this be?" Since then the Israelites
   thus deplored their lot, and cast the blame on God, the Prophet gives
   this answer, Bless themselves shall the nations and glory in him Some
   refer this to the Israelites, but not correctly. It had indeed been
   said to Abraham, "In thy seed shall all nations be blessed," or, shall
   bless themselves. But this blessing had its beginning, as it is here
   noticed by the Prophet. For we must look for the cause or the fountain
   of this blessing: how could the nations bless themselves through the
   seed or the children of Abraham, except God, the author of the
   blessing, manifested his favor towards the children of Abraham? Very
   aptly then does the Prophet say here, Then bless themselves in God
   shall all the nations, and in him shall they glory; that is, "Ye are to
   be blamed, that God's curse is upon you and renders you objects of
   reproach to all people, and also, that heathens disdain and despise the
   name of God: for your impiety has constrained God to deal more severely
   with you than he wished; for he is ever ready to shew his paternal
   clemency. What then is the hindrance, that the nations bless not
   themselves in God and glory in him? that is, that pure religion does
   not flourish through the whole world, and that all nations do not come
   to you and unite in the worship of the only true God? The hindrance is
   your impiety and wickedness; this is the reason why God is not
   glorified, and why your felicity is not everywhere celebrated among the
   nations." We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet, -- that the Jews
   groundlessly imputed blame to God, because they were oppressed by so
   many evils; for they had procured for themselves all their calamities,
   and at the same time gave occasion to heathens to profane God's name by
   their reproaches. [99] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [99] This is a very lucid and satisfactory exposition. The import of
   the passage is very clearly given. A simpler version may be made, and
   such as will exhibit the meaning more plainly. When two vaus occur,
   they may often be rendered, when and then: so here, -- 2. When thou
   shalt swear, "Live does Jehovah," In truth, in judgment, and in
   righteousness; Then call him blessed shall nations, And in him shall
   they glory. To swear is to avow Jehovah as our God. The verbs "bless"
   and "glory" are both in Hithpael, which has commonly a reciprocal
   sense, but not always. See Psalm 72:17; Psalm 105:3. This and the
   preceding verse belong to the last chapter. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 4:3

   3. For thus saith the LORD to the men of Judah and Jerusalem, Break up
   your fallow ground, and sow not among thorns.

   3. Quoniam sic dicit Jehova viro Jehudah (hoc est, Judaeis) et
   Jerosolymae, Novate vobis novale, et ne seminetis super spinas.


   The Prophet still pursues the same subject; for he reproves the
   hypocrisy of the Israelites, because they sought to discharge their
   duty towards God only by external ceremonies, while their hearts were
   full of deceits and of every kind of impiety and wickedness. Hence he
   says, that God required this from the Jews, -- to plough again the
   fallow, and not to sow among thorns.

   It is a most suitable comparison; for Scripture often compares us to a
   field, when it represents us as God's heritage; and we have been chosen
   by God as a peculiar people for this end -- that he may gather fruit
   from us, as a husbandman gathers produce from his fields. We can indeed
   add nothing to what God is; but there is a fruit which he demands; so
   that our whole life is to be devoted to his glory. God then would not
   have us to be idle and fruitless, but to bring forth some fruit. But
   what is done by hypocrites? They sow; that is, they shew some concern,
   yea, they pretend great ardor, when God exhorts them to repent, or when
   he invites them. They then make a great bustle; yet they mar everything
   by their own mixtures, the same as though one scattered his seed among
   thorns: but it will be of no avail thus to cast seed among thorns; for
   the ground ought to be well cleared and prepared. Hence God laughs to
   scorn this preposterous care and diligence, in which hypocrites pride
   themselves, and says, that they busy themselves without any advantage;
   for it is the same, as though an husbandman had wholly lost his seed;
   for when the ground is full of briers and thorns, the seed, though it
   may grow for a time, cannot yet bring forth fruit. For this reason God
   bids the Israelites to plough the fallows; [100] as though he had said,
   that they were like a rough ground, which is full of thorns, and that
   therefore there was need of unusual and by no means a common
   cultivation; for when thorns and briers grow in a field, of what
   benefit will it be to cast seed there? Nay, a field cannot be well
   prepared by the plough alone, so that it may produce fruit; but much
   labor is also necessary, as is the case with fallow ground, which is
   called essarter in our language.

   The Prophet then intimates that the people had become hardened in their
   vices, and that they were not only full of vices, like a field left
   uncultivated for two years; but that their vices were so deep, that
   they could not be well cleared away by ploughing alone, except they
   were drawn up by the roots, as they were like thorns and brambles,
   which have been growing in a field for many years. We hence see, that
   not only impiety and contempt of God, and other sins of the people of
   Israel, are referred to by the Prophet, but also their perverseness;
   for they had so hardened themselves for many years in their vices, that
   there was need not only of the plough, but also of other instruments to
   tear up the thorns, to eradicate those vices which had formed deep
   roots. As then, he had before warned them, that they would labor in
   vain except they returned to God with sincerity of heart and acquiesced
   in him; so here he bids them to examine their life, that they might not
   cast away their seed, like hypocrites, who formally acknowledge their
   sins. Hence he bids them wholly to shake off their vices, which were
   hid within, according to what they do, who tear up thorns and briers in
   a field, which has been long neglected, and left without being
   cultivated. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [100] Literally, "Plough for yourselves the ploughing," or, the
   plough-land; or, "Fallow for yourselves the fallow." They were not to
   sow a land once ploughed; but they were to plough again. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 4:4

   4 Circumcise yourselves to the Lord, and take away the foreskins of
   your heart, ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem: lest my fury
   come forth like fire, and burn that none can quench it, because of the
   evil of your doings.

   4. Circumcidimini Jehovae, et auferte praeputia cordis vestri, viri
   Jehudah et incolae Jerusalem; ne egrediatur tanquam ignis furor meus,
   et accendatur, et nemo extinguat, propter (a facie, ad verbum) malitiam
   actionum vestrarum.


   The Prophet expresses here more clearly what he had before said
   metaphorically or by a figure; for he had bidden them to eradicate
   their vices, according to what is usually done by breaking up the
   fallow ground; but now dropping that figure, he clearly shews what was
   to be done, and yet the clause contains what is figurative. He calls
   their attention to circumcision, which was a symbol of renovation, as
   though he had said, -- That they sufficiently understood what they were
   to do, except they were wholly unteachable; "For why, "he says, "has
   circumcision been enjoined? Does not God by this symbol shew, that if a
   man rightly aspires after true religion, he ought to begin by putting
   off all the evil propensities of his flesh? Is he not to deny himself,
   and to die as it were both to himself and to the world? for
   circumcision includes all this." Then the Prophet shews that the
   Israelites had no excuse, that they went not astray through mistake or
   through ignorance; but they were acting perversely and deceitfully with
   God; for circumcision, by which they had been initiated into God's
   service, sufficiently taught them, that God is not rightly nor
   faithfully served, except when men deny themselves.

   We now then see what the Prophet meant by these words, when he bids
   them to be circumcised to God, and to take away the foreskin of their
   heart: Be ye circumcised, he says, to Jehovah Circumcision was their
   great boast; but only before men; for nothing but ambition and vanity
   ruled in them, while they openly exulted and boasted that they were
   God's holy and peculiar people. Hence the Prophet bids them not to
   value what was of no importance, but to become circumcised to Jehovah;
   that is, he bids them not to seek applause before the world, but
   seriously to consider that they had to do with God. And hence he adds,
   Take away the foreskin of your heart, as though he had said, "When God
   commanded the seed of Abraham to be circumcised, (Genesis 17:10-12,) it
   was not his object to have a small portion of skin cut off, but he had
   regard to something higher, even that ye should be circumcised in
   heart."

   The Prophet, in short, teaches us here what Paul has more clearly
   explained, (Romans 2:29,) even this, -- that the letter is of no value
   before God, but that the spirit is what he requires: for Paul in these
   words means, that the external sign is worthless, except accompanied by
   the reality within; for the literal circumcision mentioned by Paul is
   merely the external rite; in the same manner baptism with us may be
   called the letter, when there is no repentance and faith. But the
   spirit, or spiritual circumcision, is the denial of self; it is
   renovation, and in a word, that true conversion to God, of which the
   Prophet speaks here. Nor has Moses been silent on this point; for in
   the tenth chapter of Deuteronomy he shews that the Jews greatly
   deceived themselves, if they thought that they did all that God
   required, when they were circumcised in the flesh; "Circumcise, "he
   says, "your hearts to the Lord." He indeed reminds us in another place,
   that this is altogether the work of God; but though God circumcises the
   heart, yet this exhortation, that men are to circumcise themselves, is
   not superfluous: and the same is the case with baptism; for when Paul
   exhorts the faithful to fear God and to lead a holy life, he refers to
   baptism. It is yet certain that men do not bestow on themselves what
   God signifies by the sign of baptism; but he counsels them to seek from
   God the grace of his Spirit, that they might not in vain be sealed by
   the external rite of baptism, while destitute of its reality. When
   therefore the Prophet bids the Israelites to take away the foreskin of
   their heart, it is the same as though he had said, that they were
   indeed liberal enough with regard to ceremonies and outward worship,
   but that these were empty masks unless preceded by a right disposition
   within.

   And he addresses the Jews, and also the inhabitants of Jerusalem, for
   they thought that they far excelled the Israelites, on whom God had
   inflicted so grievous a punishment. He then shews that the tribe of
   Judah, nay, that the very inhabitants and citizens of Jerusalem were
   not better than others, and that they could not be exempted, as it
   were, by privilege, except they returned to a right mind, except they
   seasonably and from the heart repented.

   He then adds, Lest my fury go forth like fire The Prophet here
   expressly declares, that the Jews were not to wait until God came forth
   as an avenger; for then, he says, if, would be too late to repent: in
   short, he bids them to anticipate in due time the judgment of God; for
   if once his fury went forth, it would burn like fire so as to consume
   them, and there would be no extinguishing of it. But if they repented,
   he holds forth to them the hope of pardon; for the fury of God had not
   yet gone forth.

   He afterwards subjoins, On account of the wickedness of your deeds
   [101] By these words the Prophet again reproves them sharply, and shews
   that they gained nothing by their evasions; for when God ascends his
   tribunal and begins to execute his vengeance, then all vain excuses
   will come to an end, such as, that they deserved no such thing, or,
   that the atrocity of their sins was not great: "God, "he says, "will,
   with his own hand, teach you how grievous has been the atrocity of your
   vices; he will not, then, deal with you in words." It then follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [101] Rather, "On account of the evil of your doings." Their doings
   were evil or wrong, both as to God and man. Impiety seems to be the
   special evil intended, as their defection from God had been more
   particularly referred to. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 4:5-6

   5. Declare ye in Judah, and publish in Jerusalem; and say, Blow ye the
   trumpet in the land: cry, gather together, and say, Assemble
   yourselves, and let us go into the defenced cities.

   5. Nuntiate (vel, promulgate) in Jehudah, et Jerusalem facite audire,
   (hoc est, publicate,) et dicite et clangite tuba in terra; vocate,
   colligite et dicite, Congregamini, et intremus civitates munitas.

   6. Set up the standard toward Zion: retire, stay not: for I will bring
   evil from the north, and a great destruction.

   6. Tollite signum (vel, vexilium) in Sion; congregamini (vel,
   confugite; alii vertunt, viriliter agite, deducunt enim hoc verbum ab
   zz, sed plures sequuntur diversum sensum ab zz, quod est fugere, vel,
   se colligere metus causa,) ne stetis (vel, non stabitis,) quoniam malum
   ego accerso (venire facio) ab aquilone, et contritionem magnam.


   Jeremiah treats his own people here with more severity, for he saw that
   they were refractory, and so obstinate in their vices, that they could
   not by wise counsels be restored to the way of safety. Hence he
   addresses them here as men wholly irreclaimable, and to whom
   instruction proved useless. But though according to the manner of the
   prophets, he sounds a trumpet for the sake of filling them with terror,
   he seems yet to speak tauntingly, when he bids them to proclaim in
   Judah, and to publish in Jerusalem; as though he had said, When
   distress shall seize you, you will then by experience perceive that God
   is angry with you: though to -- day ye believe not my warnings; yet
   that God may not, indeed, by a violent hand, bring you back to himself,
   and as ye seek evasions for yourselves, ye shall sound the trumpet, and
   proclaim, "The enemies are coming, and are nigh at hand; let,
   therefore, every one flee to Jerusalem, and enter into the city, and
   resort unto Zion: "that is, "If we cannot secure our safety in the
   city, we shall at least be safe in the fortress of Sion." But God, he
   says, brings an evil on you from the north; and whatever ye may think
   will be for your safety will be wholly useless. It is, however, proper,
   especially to regard the Prophet as God's herald proclaiming war; and
   that though he exults over their perverseness, he yet declares that
   such would be everywhere the terror, that they would seek safety by
   flight.

   Sound, he says, in Judah, and publish, or proclaim, in Jerusalem,
   (hgydv, egidu, announce, literally.) He speaks not here for the same
   purpose as Joel did, (Joel 1:1, 15,) when he bade them to sound the
   trumpet; for the latter exhorted the people to repent; but Jeremiah, as
   I have already said, tauntingly reproves here the people for their
   obstinacy and perverseness; as though he had said, "I see what ye will
   do, when God's vengeance shall come upon you, that ye may not even then
   repent; for ye will sound the trumpet through the whole land, Let all
   resort to Sion;' as though ye could resist there your enemies, and
   preserve your lives." He does not, then, bid them to sound the trumpet,
   but, on the contrary, shews what they would do.

   Some improperly give this rendering, "Fulfill ye, "but the common
   version is, "Assemble yourselves." But interpreters seem not to me to
   have regarded the etymology of the word; for it is of the same meaning
   in Hebrew as when we say, Amassez-vous, Gather yourselves. And say, Be
   ye assembled, and let us go into fortified cities It will, indeed, be
   announced to you to seek hiding -- places to protect you from the
   assaults of your enemies; if so, Raise a banner in Sion, and flee; but
   God will at the same time bring evil on you from the north

   The words 'l-tmdv, al-tomedu, may be explained in two ways, -- "Stand
   not," that is, "Hasten quickly," as it is the case with those in
   extreme fear; or, "Ye shall not stand," that is, "Though ye may seek a
   firm position on Mount Sion, ye shall not yet be able to continue
   there." The first exposition appears to me the best, as it is more
   suitable to the context. [102]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [102] These two verses contain a very spirited address, in a style
   truly poetical, -- 5. Announce ye in Judah, And in Jerusalem publish,
   and say, -- Yea, sound the trumpet in the land, Proclaim, do it fully,
   and say, -- "Be assembled, and let us enter into fortified cities; 6.
   Raise a banner towards Sion; Hasten ye, stay not:" For an evil am I
   bringing from the north, And a great destruction. The people of Judah
   were summoned to enter into fortified cities, and Mount Sion was to be
   the resort of the inhabitants of Jerusalem: "Hasten ye," speusate --
   hasten, Septuagint. This is the meaning of z in Hiphil. See Exodus
   9:19; Isaiah 10:31. In Jeremiah 6:1, it is translated "Gather
   yourselves to flee;" but "hasten," or remove vigorously or quickly,
   would be the best rendering. -- Ed

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we cease not daily to alienate ourselves
   from thee by our sins, and as thou yet kindly exhortest us to repent,
   and promisest to be appeasable and propitious to us, -- O grant, that
   we may not perversely go on in our sins, and be ungrateful to thee for
   thy great kindness; but that we may so return to thee, that our whole
   life may testify that our repentance has been unfeigned, and that we
   may so acquiesce in thee alone, that the depraved lusts of our flesh
   may not draw us here and there, but that we may continue fixed and
   immovable in our purpose, and so labor to obey thee through the whole
   course of our life, that we may at length partake of the fruit of our
   obedience in thy celestial kingdom, through Jesus Christ our Lord. --
   Amen.

   Jeremiah 4:7

   7. The lion is come up from his thicket, and the destroyer of the
   Gentiles is on his way; he is gone forth from his place to make thy
   land desolate; and thy cities shall be laid waste, without an
   inhabitant.

   7. Ascendit leo ex densitate sua (hoc est, ex oculto loco,) et vastator
   gentium profectus est; egressus est e loco sue ad ponendum (ut ponat)
   terram tuam in vastitatem, urbes tuae perdentur, ut non sit habitator.


   The Prophet more fully declares the import of the threatening which we
   briefly considered yesterday; for God said in the former verse, that he
   would bring an evil from the north; and the kind of evil it was to be
   he now describes, and compares the king of Babylon to a lion; and
   afterwards, without a figure, he calls him the destroyer of nations

   By the similitude of lion he means that the Israelites would not be
   able to resist; and when he adds that he would be the desolator of
   nations, he intimates that they would perish with the rest: for if
   Nebuchadnezzar was sufficiently able to destroy many nations, how could
   the Jews escape a similar calamity? He shall come, he says, the
   desolator of nations But he uses the past tense throughout, in order to
   shew the certainty of the prediction, and thus to shake secure men with
   fear, who had become torpid in their hypocrisy; for they would have
   otherwise deemed all threatenings as nothing: for as long as God spared
   them, they despised his judgment, and promised themselves impunity in
   their sins. Hence the Prophet, in order to awake them, set the matter
   before them, as though Nebuchadnezzar had already come with a strong
   and powerful army to lay waste Judea; for he says, that a lion had
   ascended from his hiding -- places: but the term for the last word
   means an entangled density, as when trees are entwined together, or
   when a place is filled with thorns. [103]

   But the similitude is most suitable, because the Jews never thought
   that the king of Babylon would come forth from places so remote; for
   the passing through was difficult, and the expedition attended with
   great toil: yet the Prophet says, that the lion would come from his
   recesses, and that nothing would hinder him from breaking forth and
   coming to the open country. He at last concludes by saying, that the
   cities would be laid waste, [104] so as to be without an inhabitant It
   now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [103] The word "thicket, "in our version, correctly expresses it; a
   tangled wood, where trees cross and entwine with each other. -- Ed.

   [104] "Laid waste" is the Chaldee sense; but the verb means in Hebrew
   to germinate, to produce grass, to grow over with grass as ruined
   cities do. The words which follow, "without an inhabitant," shew that
   this meaning suits here, -- Thy cities shall grow over with grass,
   without an inhabitant. The Targum is, Thy cities shall be desolate
   without an inhabitant. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 4:8

   8. For this gird you with sackcloth, lament and howl: for the fierce
   anger of the Lord is not turned back from us.

   8. Super hoc accingite vos saccis, plangite et ululate; quia non
   aversus est furor irae Jehovae a nobis.


   The Prophet seems not yet to exhort his own nation to repent: a more
   gracious doctrine will presently follow; but here he only reminds them
   that a most grievous mourning was nigh at hand; for he saw that they
   were hypocrites, immersed in their own delusions, and could not be
   assailed by any fear. Hence he says, that they were greatly mistaken,
   if they thought themselves safe while God was angry with them.

   Gird yourselves in sackcloth, he says, lament and howl; and then
   follows the reason, because the fury of God's wrath was not turned away
   from them. We indeed know, that the ungodly are wont to make God
   subservient to themselves, as though they could by their perverseness
   turn aside or drive afar off his judgment, and restrain, as it were,
   his hand from acting. As, then, hypocrites are insolent towards God,
   the Prophet says expressly that the fury of his wrath was not turned
   away: and thus he warns them, that they would be in every way miserable
   until they were reconciled to God.

   We now understand the design of the Prophet; for he confirms what the
   last verse contains, when he said that a lion had come forth, and that
   a desolator was already nigh; yea, he confirms what he had said, for
   there was no hope to them without having God propitious, and he
   declares that God was angry. Hence it follows, that all things would
   prove infelicitous to them.

   Jeremiah 4:9

   9. And it shall come to pass at that day, saith the LORD, that the
   heart of the king shall perish, and the heart of the princes; and the
   priests shall be astonished, and the prophets shall wonder.

   9. Et erit die illo, dicit Jehova, peribit cor Regis et cor procerum,
   et obstupescent sacerdotes, et prophetae mirabuntur (vel, attoniti
   erunt).


   As the royal dignity still continued with the Jews, though their power
   was greatly diminished, they, relying on that distinction, hoped that
   they had a sufficient protection: hence it was, that they were not
   moved by any denunciation; for the royal power, which remained not
   altogether secure, and yet so in some degree, was to them like a
   shield. We also know what pride filled the courtiers; for they extolled
   their kings, and thus made a show of their prudence and magnanimity.
   Since, then, this foolish notion of the chief men respecting their
   king, and their delusive boasting, deceived the Jews, the Prophet says,
   In that day perish shall the heart of the king, and the heart of the
   princes

   By heart he no doubt means the understanding or the mind, as the word
   is to be taken in many other places. Moses says,

   "God has not yet given you a heart to understand."
   (Deuteronomy 29:4.)

   The Latins also call men "hearted" (cordatos) who excel in intelligence
   and wisdom. [105] So, then, the Prophet shews, that it was a vain and
   deceptive fancy for the people to expect that the king would be an
   invincible defense to them; for "the king, "he says, "shall then be
   deprived of understanding and reason; and the counselors, who lay claim
   to understanding, shall be found then to be wholly foolish: there is,
   then, no ground for that vain confidence which deceives you." The
   Prophet briefly intended to shake off that false confidence, by which
   the Jews were inebriated, when they thought that there was a sure
   safety in the intelligence of the king and princes.

   He says the same thing respecting the priests as well as the prophets,
   as much glory belonged to the priestly order; for the tribe of Levi had
   not taken that honor to itself, but God himself had set priests over
   the people. Hence an opinion prevailed, that the priests could not be
   without understanding and wisdom. With regard to the prophets, Jeremiah
   no doubt conceded the name to impostors, who falsely professed the name
   of God; and this way of speaking is common in the writings of the
   prophets. He does not, then, mean those true and faithful ministers of
   God, who duly executed their office, but those who boasted of the name
   and title: and he says of these, that they would be astonished [106]

   He, in short, deprives the people of that false confidence, through
   which they hardened themselves, so as not to fear God's judgment.

   But this passage is entitled to special notice, because it shews that
   God's grace is not to be tied either to ranks of men or to titles. The
   prophetic office had always been in high repute; nor was the priestly
   without honor, for it was founded on God's command; but Jeremiah
   nevertheless declares, that there would be no understanding in the
   priests and in the prophets, because they would become stupefied and
   astonished. And with regard to the king, we know that he was the
   representative of Christ; and yet he pronounces the same thing of the
   king, and also of his counselors, -- that they would be made blind by
   the just vengeance of God, so as not to see anything. he afterwards
   adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [105] Though the most common meaning of lv, heart, is what is here
   stated, yet it means also strength, firmness, courage. See Deuteronomy
   20:2, 3; 2 Samuel 17:10; Psalm 22:14; Psalm 73:26. And this meaning is
   most suitable to this passage. -- Ed

   [106] The verse is as follows, -- And it shall be in that day, saith
   Jehovah, That perish shall the heart of the king And the heart of the
   princes, And confounded shall be the priests, And the prophets shall be
   astonished. "Confounded," that is, like persons at their wit's end, not
   knowing what to do, or what course to take. "Astonished," or amazed,
   that is, at witnessing the reverse of what they had prophesied; being
   filled with stunning and stupefying amazement. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 4:10

   10. Then said I, Ah, Lord God! surely thou hast greatly deceived this
   people and Jerusalem, saying, Ye shall have peace; whereas the sword
   reacheth unto the soul.

   10. Et dixi, Ha, ha, Domine Jehova, certe decipiendo decepisti populum
   hunc et Jerosolymam, dicendo, Pax erit vobis; et pertigit gladius usque
   ad animam (tamen pertigit, nam hic copula vice adversativae ponitur)


   Some so understand this passage as though the Prophet brought forward
   what was said by the people; for all the most wicked, when oppressed by
   God's hand, usually cast the blame on him, and in their complaints
   contend and dispute with him. Hence they think that the Prophet here,
   not in his own person, but in that of the whole people, speaks thus: "O
   Lord, what can this be? thou surely hast deceived us." Others give
   somewhat a looser explanation, that the Prophet here indirectly
   expostulates with God, because he had suffered the false prophets to
   flatter the people so as to stupefy the minds of all. But a different
   meaning is what I approve of: the Prophet, I think, tauntingly exposes
   those false adulations, by which the prophets had caused the ruin of
   the miserable Jews, by promising them God's forgiveness, and by ever
   announcing favorable predictions.

   God no doubt rendered the Jews their just reward, when he suffered them
   to be deceived by impostors: we, indeed, know that the world is ever
   afflicted with this disease, -- that they seek flatteries, as God
   upbraids them by Micah:

   "Ye seek prophets who promise to you an abundant harvest, an abundant
   vintage."
   (Micah 2:11)

   Since, then, the Jews wished their vices to be spared, and not only
   disliked their faithful and severe reprovers, but also hated them, they
   had deserved to be thus dealt with: it was God's will that many
   impostors should assume the prophetic name. Thus it happened, that the
   Jews thought that their peaceable condition would be perpetual; and
   this, as I have said, is usual with hypocrites. Now the Prophet, in a
   biting strain, exposes here these deceptions, and says, Ah, ah,
   Jehovah! surely thou hast deceived this people: for the Prophet does
   not speak in the person of the people, nor does he complain, that God
   permitted so much liberty to false prophets; but he derides these
   impostors as well as the people. And further, as they were all deaf, he
   turns to God, as though he had said, "Behold, Lord, worthy of this
   reward are they, who have sought flatteries, and have not attended to
   the holy warnings of thy servants: as, then, no kind of correction was
   what they could endure, let them now begin to learn that they have been
   deceived by others rather than by thee." [107]

   We then see that the Prophet ridicules that stupidity in which the Jews
   had been so long asleep; and the simple meaning is, that he turned to
   God: I have said, O Lord Jehovah, surely thou hast deceived this
   people. "Surely" is to be taken in an ironical sense; that is, "It now
   really appears that they have been deceived; but by whom? They wish,
   indeed, to throw the blame on thee; but they are justly chargeable with
   foolish credulity, so that they, whom the false prophets have deceived,
   have been rightly dealt with." What they said was, Peace shall be to
   you

   This never came from the mouth of God; for Jeremiah daily thundered and
   threatened approaching ruin; for he was like a celestial herald, who
   filled every place with terror; but he was not heard: and at the same
   time the Jews praised the false prophets, who soothed them with various
   promises. We hence perceive, that God had not spoken peace to them; but
   that the Jews, not only willingly, but with avidity, laid hold on those
   things by which the false prophets sought to gratify them.

   He afterwards adds, And reached has the sword unto the soul; that is,
   "Yet we are now destroyed by fatal evils." The Prophet here indirectly
   sets before them those delusive flatteries with which the Jews pleased
   themselves, and shews that they would at length really find how falsely
   they pretended the name of God. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [107] There are various expositions of this verse: but the simpler and
   the plainer mode would be to take 'mr as a noun, word, speech, saying,
   with an auxiliary verb, which is commonly omitted in Hebrew. The
   connection with the foregoing would be obvious and natural, -- And the
   saying will be, "Alas! Lord Jehovah, Surely, deceiving thou hast
   deceived This people and Jerusalem, By saying, Peace shall be to you;'
   And reach does the sword even to the soul." This would be the language
   of such as believed the false prophets, and considered them as sent by
   God. But Lowth, Henry, Venema, Scott, and others, take this view, --
   that God had permitted or suffered the people to be deceived by the
   false prophets. It is said that this verb in Hiphil, as the case is
   here, has sometimes this meaning, and Lowth refers, as instances, to
   Isaiah 63:17, and also to Psalm 119:10; Proverbs 10:3. But the
   sentiment of the passage in this case would not be very suitable: for,
   according to this view, the cause of the Prophet's grief is, that God
   had suffered the people to be deceived. "It shall be said," in the next
   verse, seems to be put in contrast with this "saying." Instead of what
   would be commonly said of the people, God reminds them of what he would
   cause to be said and effected. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 4:11-12

   11. At that time shall it be said to this people and to Jerusalem, A
   dry wind of the high places in the wilderness toward the daughter of my
   people, not to fan, nor to cleanse,

   11. In tempore illo dicetur populo huic (hoc est, de populo hoc; l enim
   hic accipitur pro v,) et de Jerusalem, ventus siccus (alii transferunt,
   vehementem) in excelsis deserti (in deserto, ad verbum,) versus viam
   filiae populi mei, non ad spargendum, neque ad purgandum;

   12. Even a full wind from those places shall come unto me: now also
   will I give sentence against them.

   12. Ventus plenior illis veniet mihi: nunc etiam ego loquar judicia cum
   illis (hoc est, proferam judicia cum illis.)


   Jeremiah proceeds with the same prediction: he says, that a terrible
   wind was coming, which would not only disperse or clear away, but
   dissipate and overthrow all things. He then expresses how great and how
   grievous would be the calamity which he had before mentioned. He
   compares it to dry or and wind; for tsch, tsach, sometimes means
   "clear," and sometimes "arid," as the greatest dryness is found on high
   places. He means, no doubt, here the wind, which is violent, and
   disturbs the whole atmosphere, when there are no clouds, and where no
   trees impede its course. Hence, he speaks of high and desert places. It
   is the same as though he had said, that so great would be the violence
   of God's vengeance, and so irresistible would be the eruption, that it
   would be like a violent wind when it passes through high regions and
   through dry land or desert places. He says, Towards the way of the
   daughter of my people; as though he had said, -- that the course of the
   wind would be such as to bear directly on Judea. The mode of speaking
   here used is well known to all who are in any degree acquainted with
   the writings of the prophets. "The daughter of my people, "means the
   people themselves. Come, then, shall wind towards Judea.

   He then adds, Not to scatter nor to cleanse Husbandmen are wont to
   winnow the corn when taken from the thrashing -- floor, that the chaff
   may be carried away by the wind: but the Prophet says, that this wind
   would not be to clear away or scatter the chaff; for it will be, he
   says, a very vehement wind He means, in short, that God would shew so
   much displeasure towards the Jews, that he would no longer chastise
   them in a moderate degree, or use any moderation, as he had done
   previously; for God had already often punished the Jews, but had
   hitherto acted the part of a physician, having endeavored to heal the
   vices of the people. As, then, these corrections had been without
   fruit, the Prophet now says, that God's wrath would now come, not to
   cleanse as before, nor to scatter the chaff, but to consume everything
   among the people. Hence he adds (for the two verses are connected
   together) a fuller wind, or one more complete, shall come to them. Some
   read, "from these places, "so they render m; but it is rather to be
   taken as noting the comparative degree, -- that this wind would be much
   rougher and more violent than other winds which usually clear the land
   or scatter away the chaff, and separate it from the corn: come, then,
   shall a much more violent wind

   And come, he says, unto me God, I doubt not, speaks here. Some think
   that the Prophet here represents the whole body of the people; and they
   consider them as saying, that there would come a wind which would rush
   on themselves. But this is too strained; and further, this explanation
   is disproved by the context: nor can what follows be applied to the
   Prophet, I will now pronounce judgments against them Here then God, in
   his office as a judge, declares that a wind was nigh, by which he would
   dissipate and overthrow the whole of Judea, and would no more cleanse
   it. And thus he shews, that the Chaldeans would not of themselves come,
   but would be sent to execute his orders; as though he had said, -- that
   he would be the author of those calamities which were impending over
   the Jews: come, then, shall wind unto me; that is, it will be ready to
   obey my orders.

   And he adds at last, by way of an exposition, I will then speak
   judgments with them To speak judgments is to execute the office of a
   judge, or to call to judgment, or to summon men to declare their cause,
   as kings are said to speak judgments when they constrain the guilty to
   render an account, of themselves. God briefly intimates, that he had
   hitherto exercised great forbearance towards the Jews; but that as he
   found that his indulgence availed nothing, except that they became more
   and more ferocious, he declares, that he would now become their judge
   to punish their wickedness. [108] He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [108] The Septuagint version of these two verses is as foreign to the
   original as it can well be; and the Syriac and Arabic are nearly the
   same. The Vulgate gives a fair version; and the meaning, as given by
   the Targum, is nearly the same. The latter part of the 11th and 12th
   are thus rendered by Blayney, -- A wind that scorcheth the plains in
   the wilderness, [Shall come] toward the daughter of my people, Not to
   winnow, nor to cleanse; 12. A full wind for a curse shall come at my
   bidding; Now even I will proceed judicially with them. Horsley differs
   as to the 11th verse, and renders it thus, -- The wind that scorcheth
   the craggy rocks of the wilderness Taketh its course against the
   daughter of my people, Not for winnowing or cleansing. The reason
   assigned for rendering m'lh for "a curse," and not "from those places,"
   as in our version, is, because the enemy did not come from that
   quarter. But this may be avoided, if we consider "as" or "like" to be
   understood before wind, which is no uncommon thing in Hebrew. To refer
   "those" or these to the winds implied in winnowing and cleansing, as
   Calvin does, and also Gataker and others, is not satisfactory, I would
   propose the following version, -- The dry wind of the cliffs in the
   wilderness Is advancing against the daughter of my people, Not to
   winnow, nor to cleanse; 12. As a full wind from these, it shall come
   for me: Then will I myself pronounce judgments on them. The word drk,
   as Horsley takes it, is a verb, or rather a participle; and it is usual
   in Hebrew to put a participle in the first clause, and in the second a
   verb, as here, in the future tense. The verb means to come upon, so as
   to tread down or subdue, Judges 5:21; Judges 20:43; Psalm 91:13. "The
   effect of this wind is not only to render the air extremely hot and
   scorching, but to fill it with poisonous and suffocating vapors." --
   Blayney. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 4:13

   13. Behold, he shall come up as clouds, and his chariots shall be as a
   whirlwind: his horses are swifter than eagles. Woe unto us! for we are
   spoiled.

   13. Ecce tanquam nubes ascendet, et tanquam turbo currus ejus;
   celeriores aquilis equi ejus: vae nobis, quia perditi sumus.


   The Prophet here concludes the prediction which referred to the
   dreadful vengeance that was coming; and he mentions here several
   similitudes, such as might rouse the Jews and constrain them to fear.
   He says, that the chariots of God would come as clouds and as a
   whirlwind; and then that his horses would be swifter than eagles

   As to the clouds, the whirlwind, and the eagles, (for the import of the
   three similitudes is the same,) the Prophet no doubt intended thus to
   set forth the quickness of God's vengeance; but yet there is some
   difference. We see how clouds suddenly arise and spread over the whole
   heaven; and thus it happens when a whirlwind is in the air. Hence when
   he compares God's chariots to clouds and the whirlwind, it is the same
   as if he had said, that the beginning of the calamity would be sudden,
   because God would unexpectedly arise, after having been apparently
   asleep for a long time. But when he says, that God's horses would be
   swifter than eagles, he means, that it would be easy for God, when once
   he had begun, to destroy the whole of Judea, as it were in a moment, or
   at least in a very short time; for we know how swift is the flying of
   the eagle; but he says, that the horses of God would be swifter than
   the eagles.

   We now understand the Prophet's meaning: for when the Jews derided the
   threatenings of the Prophets, they tauntingly used such a language as
   this, -- "O! we shall, at least in the meantime, feast cheerfully and
   joyfully; these Prophets will not allow us a truce for one hour; but
   yet many years will pass away before the evil overtakes us." We find
   profane men in our day, who in like manner trifle with God: and when
   they cannot wholly despise what God threatens, they yet delay the time,
   and think that they gain something by putting off the day of vengeance.
   This, then, was the reason why the Prophet said, that God's chariots
   would ascend, as clouds arise suddenly, and then as a whirlwind in
   clear sky, and lastly, in a manner swifter than the eagles, even in
   their swiftest course.

   The Prophet, in the last place, exclaims, in the name of the whole
   people, Woe to us! for we are lost [109] He speaks here concisely, that
   he might shew that the false prophets, as well as the people, were
   going astray to their own ruin, while they were asleep in their vices,
   and thought their insensibility would escape punishment. He hence
   exclaims, that though all were then seized with stupor, the people
   themselves were yet lost. It at length follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [109] Rather, "We have been wholly wasted," or desolated. The verb is
   in a reduplicate form, and signifies an entire waste or desolation, --
   13. Behold, like clouds will he ascend, And like a whirlwind will be
   his chariots, Swifter than eagles his horses: "Woe to us! for we have
   been wholly wasted." The mixture of the tenses is intended to shew the
   certainty of the event. Or we may consider the last line as containing
   what would be said after the coming of the enemy. What they would have
   to say was to acknowledge their entire desolation. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 4:14

   14. O Jerusalem, wash thine heart from wickedness, that thou mayest be
   saved. How long shall thy vain thoughts lodge within thee?

   14. Munda a malitia cor tuum, Jerusalem, ut salva sis: quousque
   manebunt in medio tui cogitationes vanitatis tuae? (alii vertunt,
   doloris tui; alii, concupiscentiae tuae; alii, iniquitatis, ac si esset
   vnk.)


   Here now the Prophet expressly and avowedly exhorts the people to
   repent. By bidding Jerusalem to wash from wickedness her heart, that
   she might be saved, he shews that there was no remedy, except the Jews
   were reconciled to God; and that this could not be, except they
   repented of their sins. He had said before, that while God was angry
   they could not but perish; he now confirms the same thing, -- that thou
   mayest be saved, wash thine heart from wickedness; as though he had
   said, that there was war between the Jews and God, and that salvation
   could by no means be hoped for, since God was armed for their
   destruction, and shewed himself a judge to punish their vices: he at
   the same time reminds them of the true way of repentance; it was by
   washing their heart from wickedness. For hypocrites ever seek to
   appease God by external rites and observances; but the Prophet shows
   that God cannot be pacified, except they from the heart return to him.
   He then means that the beginning of true repentance is an inward
   feeling. We now perceive what the Prophet means.

   But they reason foolishly who maintain that repentance is the cause of
   salvation, because it is said, "That thou mayest be saved, wash thy
   heart from wickedness:" and the Papists lay hold on such passages to
   set up free -- will; and they hold that sins are abolished and
   punishment remitted through satisfactions made by us. But this is
   extremely absurd and frivolous. For the Prophet is not speaking of the
   cause of salvation; but, as I have said, he simply shows that men are
   extremely thoughtless when they expect a peaceable condition, while
   they carry on war with God, and when he is armed to execute vengeance
   on them. We are not then to inquire here, whether a sinner delivers
   himself from God's hand by his repentance: but the Prophet had only
   this one thing in view -- that we cannot be safe and secure, except God
   be reconciled to us. He further shews, that God will not be propitious
   to us, except we repent, and that from the heart or from a genuine
   feeling within.

   He then adds, How long shall remain within thee the thoughts of thy
   vanity? He here touches on the hypocrisy of his own nation; and he in
   effect says, that whatever excuses they might make, they were yet
   proved guilty before God, and that their evasions were frivolous,
   because God penetrated into the inmost recesses of their hearts. He
   indeed speaks most suitably, for he had to do with hypocrites who
   thought that their outward performances pacified God; and they also
   thought that when they alleged their evasions they ought to be
   forgiven, as they could not be condemned by earthly judges. The Prophet
   derides these delusive thoughts, How long shall thoughts of vanity
   remain within thee? that is, "Though the whole world were to absolve
   thee, what yet would it avail thee? For vain thoughts remain in the
   midst of thee, that is, in the recesses of thy heart; and God knows
   them, for nothing is hid from him. There is then no reason for you to
   think that ye will gain anything by your outward display or your
   excuses; for God is the searcher of hearts. Let not these thoughts
   continue within thee."

   He calls them the thoughts of vanity The word, 'vn, aun, means
   sometimes substance, but, it also means power, and sometimes grief, and
   sometimes vanity or trouble. The Prophet means here, I have no doubt,
   trouble or vanity. But some expound it as signifying lust; but I know
   not whether it can be so taken. Either of the two foregoing meanings
   may suit the passage, though vanity seems the best, How long, then,
   shall thoughts of vanity remain within thee? that is, by which thou
   deceivest thyself: for when God suspended his vengeance, the Jews
   thought that they had escaped from his hand. [110] They might, at the
   same time, have been called the thoughts of trouble or sorrow from the
   effect; for how could it have been otherwise, but they must have found
   that they had procured a heavier judgment for themselves, by trifling
   with the indulgence and forbearance of God? Too strained is the
   explanation given by some, who render the words, "thoughts of grief,
   "because the Jews had done many wrongs to their neighbors, and caused
   them unjust vexations. I therefore doubt not but that the Prophet
   refers to those deceptive hopes, by which the Jews grew more perverse
   against God, so as not to fear any punishment.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [110] The word means also iniquity, wickedness: and this is the sense
   in which the Vulgate and the Targum have taken it, and also Blayney,
   "the devices of thine iniquity:" and this corresponds more with the
   former part of the verse. The whole is as follows, -- 14. Wash from
   evil thine heart, O Jerusalem, that thou mayest be saved: How long
   shall lodge within thee The thoughts of thy wickedness, Or, Thy wicked
   thoughts. The word for "wash" here, according to Parkhurst, is ever
   applied to express a thorough washing, the washing away of what is
   inherent, such as the dirt of linen and of clothes: and he says, that
   there is another word, rchph, which is used when the washing of the
   surface of anything is intended, such as the washing of hands. "Shall
   lodge," -- it is no objection that this is singular, and the "thoughts"
   plural. It is an idiom: the same exists in Welsh: and in no other form
   would this sentence be rendered in that language. The present
   translation is incorrect, as the verb is taken to be in the second
   person, and applied to Jerusalem; which cannot be, as in that case it
   must have been in the feminine gender. The correct rendering would be,
   -- Pa hyd y hetya o'th fewn Dy feddyliau drygionus! If the verb had
   followed its nominative case, it would have been in the same number;
   but as it precedes it, it is singular while the noun is plural. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou art pleased daily to invite us to
   repentance, and since our own conscience is a witness, how we have in
   various ways provoked thy vengeance, -- O grant, that we may not remain
   obstinate in our sins, nor harden our minds by perverse delusions, but
   suffer ourselves to be subdued by thy word, and so offer ourselves to
   thee with a pure and sincere heart, that our whole life may be nothing
   else but a striving for that newness which thou requirest; so that,
   being consecrated to thee in mind and body, we may ever labor to
   glorify thy name, until we be made partakers of that glory, which has
   been obtained for us by the blood of thy only -- begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 4:15

   15. For a voice declareth from Dan, and publisheth affliction from
   mount Ephraim.

   15. Quia vox annuntians e Dan, et promulgans cladem (vel, poenam) e
   monte Ephraim (alii vertunt, iniquitatem 'vn).


   The Prophet again repeats what he had said, -- that the Jews were given
   up, on account of their perverseness, to final ruin; for they had so
   often and for so long a time provoked God, and had not attended to
   pious admonitions, when God by his servants the prophets offered pardon
   to them on their repentance. But the whole passage, which I shall now
   explain, gives a lively representation of the ruin that was at hand;
   for we see that in this verse there is a scene presented to us, as the
   Prophet sets before our eyes what could not be fully expressed in
   words.

   A voice, he says, declares from Daniel This was the extreme border on
   the north He had before said, that an evil was coming from that
   quarter, that is, from the north; for God had chosen the Chaldeans as
   the executors of his vengeance: hence he says, "a voice is heard from
   Dan;" not that there was an army already prepared to attack the Jews,
   but Jeremiah speaks here by the prophetic spirit; and he sets the event
   as present before the Jews, who thought not that so grievous an evil
   was nigh. For we said yesterday, that when God for a time spares
   hypocrites, they become more hardened, and with haughty contempt deride
   his prophets. When, therefore, Jeremiah saw that he had to do with
   blocks, he deemed it necessary to use figurative language, which
   exhibited to them more clearly that the judgment, which the Jews
   imagined they had no reason to fear, was near at hand: hence he says, a
   voice is heard from Dan

   And proclaims 'vn, aun, that is, trouble, or punishment, or ruin. The
   other rendering, to which I have referred, is not suitable. The word
   'vn, aun, does indeed properly signify iniquity; but it is to be taken
   here for punishment. [111] But whenever the Prophets use this term,
   they intimate that evil is not inflicted by God except for just causes;
   and they remind us that its source or fountain is to be found in the
   wickedness of men. Ruin then was coming from Mount Ephraim which was
   near the tribe of Judah and also Jerusalem. But it was the same as
   though Jeremiah had said, that God was now thundering from heaven, and
   that it would be of no avail to the Jews to close their ears: for
   though they were even deaf, yet God's vengeance would soon come to
   light, accompanied with dreadful noise. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [111] The first meaning of the word is iniquity, wickedness; and as the
   fruit or the effect of wickedness is affliction, distress, misery, it
   is sometimes taken to express the latter idea. It may be rendered here,
   distress. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 4:16

   16. Make ye mention to the nations; behold, publish against Jerusalem,
   that watchers come from a far country, and give out their voice against
   the cities of Judah.

   16. Memorate in gentibus (vel, ad gentes,) ecce promulgate super
   Jerusalem, obsessores veniunt e terra longinqua, et mittunt super urbes
   Jehudah vocem suam.


   The beginning of this verse is variously explained. Some read,
   "Remember ye the nations, "and think that the Prophet says this,
   because many of the nations were heralds of that vengeance of God,
   which the Jews despised, as they thought that what the true heralds of
   God declared were mere fables. They therefore take the meaning of this
   passage, as though Jeremiah sent the Jews to the nations, intimating
   that they were unworthy that God should send them his usual teachers.
   But as the verb is in Hiphil, we ought rather to read, Rehearse it: and
   some give this explanation, "Rehearse, "or tell, "of the nations;" that
   is, "Announce that the Chaldeans are hastening to lay waste the land,
   to pull down the cities of Judah and to destroy the people." But there
   is a third meaning which, in my judgment, comports better with the
   passage. He literally says, Rehearse it to the nations; behold,
   proclaim against Jerusalem: for as the Prophet saw that he spent his
   labor in vain on that stupid people, who had become so hardened in
   their perverseness, that they were wholly inattentive and unteachable,
   he turned his address to the nations, and said, "Rehearse it to the
   Gentiles;" as though he had said, "I have long ago reminded this
   people, that God had other teachers; but what have we gained by our
   labor, except that the people become continually worse: since then it
   is so, now he says, Declare it to the nations concerning Jerusalem;'
   let the Jews hear nothing more of their ruin, but let God's vengeance
   on them be made known to the heathens." There is nothing strained or
   obscure in this explanation; and it is wholly consonant with the
   prophetic style. [112]

   He then deigned no longer to favor his own nation with heavenly truth;
   because this would have cast what was holy to the dogs; but he directs
   his discourse to the heathens, as though he had said, "There is more
   knowledge in the blind and unbelieving than in the chosen people of
   God." This does not shew but that he afterwards continued a long time
   in the discharge of his office; for the prophets, inflamed with zeal
   for God, often threatened the people with utter ruin, and afterwards
   performed their charge and tried whether they, of whom they seemed to
   despair, were healable.

   He says that besiegers would come from a far country. Some render
   ntsrym, netserim, keepers; and they think that Jeremiah alludes to
   Nebuchadnezzar, because his captains would come to destroy Jerusalem
   and to demolish the cities of Judah. But I prefer to render the word
   "besiegers." Though some think that ntsr, netser, sometimes means to
   destroy or lay waste; yet the other meaning seems more suitable, as it
   appears evident from the next verse. To render it keepers, seems to be
   frigid; though this is what is done almost by all. I render it
   "besiegers," -- Come then shall besiegers; for ntsr, netser, means not
   only to keep, but also to shut up in a strait place. Come, he says,
   shall besiegers from a far country. He used these expressions, that the
   people might not promise themselves impunity, as it has been before
   stated, through the forbearance of God: for when God deferred his
   vengeance, they thought themselves relieved from all fear. Hence he
   says, that though the enemy was not as yet present, though they did not
   as yet hear the sound of the coming enemy, God at the same time did not
   threaten them in vain; for he would in an instant send for those from a
   distant land, who would execute his vengeance.

   What follows, they shall send forth their voice against the cities of
   Judah, is added, in order that the Jews might know that they could by
   no hindrances prevent God from bringing quickly the Chaldeans to
   terrify their cities by their sound. What he indeed means is the shout
   by which soldiers rouse one another to fight: but as this is commonly
   done as a sign of victory, he intimates that it was all over with the
   Jews; for the soldiers had as it were already uttered their triumphant
   shoutings. [113] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [112] The verb in the first sentence followed by l is found in Amos
   6:10; where it clearly means "to make mention of," or simply, to
   mention. So it may be rendered here, "Make ye mention of the nations,"
   or, Mention the nations, that is, for the sake of frightening the Jews.
   He had before referred to the voice from Dan, etc.; he now commands the
   invading nations to be proclaimed as approaching. The meaning is not,
   as Blayney, as well as Calvin, renders the phrase, "Proclaim ye unto
   the nations," but, "Proclaim the nations," as approaching, according to
   what is afterwards stated. -- Ed

   [113] To make this verse consistent with the context, I render it as
   follows, -- Mention ye the nations, (and say,) "Behold them!" Repeat at
   Jerusalem, "The watchers are coming from a distant land, And shall
   raise against the cities of Judah their voice." It is not improbable
   that l here means "over," and that the "voice" means a triumphant
   shout, as Calvin seems to have thought. Then we may give this
   rendering, -- And shall raise over the cities of Judah their shout. --
   Ed.

   Jeremiah 4:17

   17. As keepers of a field, are they against her round about; because
   she hath been rebellious against me, saith the Lord.

   17. Sicuti custodes (est aliud nomen quam prius smrym,) agri erunt
   super eam in circuitu; quia me exacerbarit, dicit Jehova.


   He intimates here that there would be no escape to the Jews when God
   brought the Chaldeans, for every egress, all the ways, would be closed
   up, so that they could not migrate to another land. It is the same as
   though he had said, that such a calamity was nigh them that they could
   not escape it by exile, it is indeed a sad thing when men flee away
   naked as from the fire, and seek a place among strangers, and live
   there in misery and want; but the Prophet declares here, that so
   grievous was the punishment prepared for the Jews, that it would not
   indeed be possible for them to save themselves by expatriation and
   flight, for God would close up every avenue, and would as it were set
   guards to prevent any to depart.

   He afterwards assigns a reason for this, Because they have made me
   angry [114] The Prophet again shews that God dealt not cruelly with the
   Jews, nor that they were visited by chance with so many and so grievous
   calamities, but that they suffered justly, for they had provoked the
   wrath of God. It would indeed have availed the Jews but little that
   they dreaded an approaching evil, except they acknowledged that God was
   punishing them for their perverseness. Hence the reason is stated: it
   was mentioned, that the Jews might know that these calamities were
   brought on them by God's hand. And for the same purpose is what follows
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [114] Calvin has followed the Vulgate and the Syriac. The Septuagint
   and Arabic have, "thou hast neglected me," which is very wide from the
   original. "Rebel" is the rendering of the Targum, which is the Hebrew,
   and there is no other reading. Literally it is, For against me hath she
   rebelled, saith Jehovah. And this is the rendering of Blayney. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 4:18

   18. Thy way and thy doings have procured these things unto thee; this
   is thy wickedness, because it is bitter, because it reacheth unto thine
   heart.

   18. Via tua et actiones tuae fecerunt hoc tibi; haec malitia tua,
   quoniam amarum, quoniam pertigit ad cor tuum (vel, quamvis amarum sit,
   et quamvis pertigerit ad cor tuum.)


   As I have just said, the Prophet confirms what he had declared, -- that
   the Jews would not have to suffer, according to what is commonly said,
   an adverse fortune, but would be summoned by God to judgment, in order
   that being touched with the fear of God, they might repent, or at
   least, though destroyed as to the flesh, they might yet, being humbled,
   obtain pardon and be saved as to the Spirit.

   He therefore says, that their deeds had done this for them; as though
   he had said, "There is no reason for you to blame God, or your adverse
   fortune, as ye are wont to do, and as all the heathens also do; for
   your own deeds have procured for you these calamities. Thus God will
   perform his office of a judge; and whatever may happen to you is to be
   ascribed to your own wickedness." And to the same purpose is what he
   adds, This is thy wickedness. In short, the Prophet shews, that the
   Jews in vain transferred their calamities to this or that cause, for
   the whole blame was in themselves; they procured for themselves their
   own ruin by their impiety and evil deeds.

   In the second clause of the verse, ky mr ky ng, ki mer, ki nego, etc.,
   the Prophet intimates, that however bitter might be to them what they
   were to endure, and however it might penetrate into the inmost heart,
   it was yet to be ascribed to themselves. For hypocrites are wont in
   their lamentations to cast the blame on God, or at least to complain of
   fortune. The Prophet anticipates these evasions, by shewing that
   however bitter might be what the Jews had to endure, and that though
   God should pierce them through and penetrate to their very bowels and
   hearts, yet they themselves were the authors of all their calamities.
   [115] He then adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [115] Blayney, contrary to all the early versions, renders 'lh, "a
   curse," instead of "these," but there is no sufficient reason for the
   change. It is difficult to see what is the precise idea intended in our
   version as to the latter part of the verse. The meaning given by Calvin
   seems to be this, -- that though the visitation was bitter and reached
   to the heart, it was yet to be ascribed to their wickedness. Blayney's
   version is this, -- Such is thy calamity; for it is bitterness;
   for it is a plague even unto thy heart. The latter words are taken as
   explanatory of the calamity. The word rh does indeed mean sometimes a
   calamity; but all the early versions, as well as the Targum, render it
   here "wickedness." Hence the most suitable rendering would be, -- Such
   is thy wickedness!
   Though bitter, though reaching to thy heart. That ky may be rendered
   "though" is evident from Joshua 17:18; and it ought to be so rendered
   in Exodus 34:9; and in other places. But we may take the first kyin its
   primary sense, surely, certainly, truly, and the second as a causative,
   for, because; an instance of a similar kind we meet in Exodus 13:17:
   the first kyprecedes an adjective, and is rendered "Although;" and the
   second ky, a verb, and is rendered "for." Then our version would be, --
   Such is thy wickedness (that is, its effect)!
   Surely, bitter; for it reaches to thy heart. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 4:19

   19. My bowels, my bowels! I am pained at my very heart; my heart maketh
   a noise in me; I cannot hold my peace, because thou hast heard, O my
   soul, the sound of the trumpet, the alarm of war.

   19. Viscera mea, viscera mea doleo, parietes cordis mei (ad verbum, hoc
   est, praecordia mea,) cor meum tumultuatur mihi (hoc est, intra me;)
   non tacebo, quoniam vocem tubae (vel, clangorem tubae) audivit (vel
   audivisti) anima mea; et clamor belli auditus est (vel, clamourem belli
   audivit anima mea.)


   Some interpreters think that the Prophet is here affected with grief,
   because he saw that his own nation would soon perish; but I know not
   whether this is a right view. It is indeed true, that the prophets,
   though severe when denouncing God's vengeance, did not yet put off the
   feelings of humanity. Hence they often bewailed the evils which they
   predicted; and this we shall see more clearly in its proper place. The
   prophets then had two feelings: when they were the heralds of God's
   vengeance, they necessarily forgot their own sensibilities; but this
   courage did not prevent them from feeling sorrow for others; for they
   could not but sympathize with their brethren, when they saw them, even
   their own flesh, doomed to ruin. But in this place the Prophet seems
   not so much to mourn the calamities of the people, but employs
   figurative terms in order to awaken their stupor, for he saw that they
   were torpid, and that they neither feared God nor were touched with any
   shame. Since then there was so much insensibility in the people, it was
   necessary for Jeremiah and other servants of God to embellish their
   discourses, so as not simply to teach, but also forcibly and strongly
   to rouse their dormant minds.

   He therefore says, My bowels, my bowels! We shall see that the Prophet
   in other places thus laments, when he speaks of Babylon, of Edom, and
   of other enemies of his people, and why? The Prophet was not indeed
   affected with grief when he heard that the Chaldeans would perish, and
   when God declared to him the same thing respecting other heathen
   nations, who had cruelly persecuted the holy people; but since
   thoughtless men, as I have said, take no notice of what God from heaven
   threatens them with, it is necessary to use such expressions as may
   rouse them from their torpor. So I interpret this place: the Prophet
   does not express his own grief for the calamities of his people, but by
   the prophetic spirit enlarges on what he had previously said; for he
   saw that what he had stated had no effect, or was not sufficient to
   rouse their minds. My bowels! he says. He had indeed grief in his
   bowels, for he was a member of the community; but we now speak of his
   object or the purpose he had in view in speaking thus. It is not then
   the expression of his own grief, but an affecting description, in order
   that what he had said might thoroughly rouse the minds of those who
   heedlessly laughed at the judgment of God.

   He then adds, My heart tumultuates, or makes a noise: the verb means to
   resound, and hence it is metaphorically taken for tumultuating. He
   speaks of the palpitation of the heart, which takes place when there is
   great fear. But he calls it noise or tumult, as though he had said,
   that he was not now master of himself, so as to retain a calm and
   tranquil mind, for God smote his heart with horrible dread. He
   afterwards adds, I will not be silent, for the sound of the trumpet has
   my soul heard, or thou, my soul, hast heard, and the clamor of battle;
   for the word mlchmhchme, is to be thus taken here. He says that he
   would not be silent because this clamor made a noise in his heart. We
   hence conclude that he grieved not from a feeling of human sorrow, but
   he did that which he had been bidden to do by God; for he had been
   chosen to be the herald of God's vengeance, which was nigh, though not
   dreaded by the Jews. [116]

   Some think that soul is here to be taken for the prophetic spirit, for
   trumpets had not yet sounded, nor was yet heard the clamor of battle.
   They therefore suppose that there is to be understood here a contrast,
   that Jeremiah did not perceive the noise by his ears, but in his heart.
   But I know not whether this refinement may be fitly applied to the
   Prophet's words. I therefore think that Jeremiah means, that he spoke
   in earnest, because he saw God's vengeance as though it were already
   made evident. And this availed not a little to gain credit to what he
   had stated, so that the Jews might know that he did not speak of
   himself, nor act a part as players do on the stage. They were then to
   know that he did not relate what God had pronounced, but that he was
   God's herald in such a way, that he heard in his soul or heart, to his
   great terror, the tumult of war and the sound of the trumpet. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [116] Remarkably concise and striking are the words of this verse, --
   My bowels! my bowels! I am in pain! O the enclosures of my heart!
   Turbulent is my heart within me; I will not be silent; for the sound of
   the trumpet Have I heard; my soul, the shout of battle. To change the
   person of the verb, "I am in pain," or in labor, as it literally means,
   as Blayney does, destroys the force and the vehemence of the passage;
   and all the early versions retain the first person. "The enclosures,"
   literally "the walls," that is, what encloses or surrounds the heart,
   he mentions first the bowels, then what surrounds the heart, and
   afterwards the heart itself: and his pain was like that of a woman in
   travail. Being in this state, he resolved not to be silent but to
   declare their danger to the people. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 4:20

   20. Destruction upon destruction is cried; for the whole land is
   spoiled: suddenly are my tents spoiled, and my curtains in a moment.

   20. Afflictio super afflictionem vocata est; quoniam perdita est omnis
   terra subito; perdita (vel, destructa, est idem verbum) sunt
   tabernacula mea, repente cortinae meae.


   He pursues the same subject, but amplifies the dread by a new
   circumstance, -- that God would heap evils on evils, so that the Jews
   would in vain hope for an immediate relief. By saying, A calamity upon
   a calamity, he means that the end of one evil would be the beginning of
   another. For it is what especially distresses miserable men, when they
   think that their evils will continue long. They indeed imagined that
   God would be satisfied with an evil that would be soon over, like a
   storm or a tempest: and when an alleviation appeared, they would have
   thought that they had suffered enough and would have returned again to
   their old ways and derided God as though they had escaped from his
   hands. For this reason the Prophet declares, that their calamities
   would for a long time continue, so that no end to them could be hoped
   for, until the Jews were wholly destroyed. By saying that calamities
   were called, or summoned, he briefly reminds them, that God would sit
   on his tribunal, and that after inflicting light punishment on men for
   their sins, he would add heavier punishment, and that when he found
   their wickedness incurable, he would proceed to extremities, so as
   wholly to destroy those who could not be reclaimed. Called then has
   been distress upon distress: and how was this? Perished has the whole
   land; and then, my tabernacles have been suddenly destroyed, in an
   instant destroyed has been my curtains. [117]

   It is thought that the Prophet here compares strongly fortified cities
   to tents and curtains, in order to expose the foolish confidence with
   which the Jews were proudly filled, thinking that their cities were a
   sufficient protection from enemies. It is then supposed that the
   Prophet here deprives them of their vain confidence by calling these
   cities tents. There are also those who think that he alludes to his own
   city Anathoth, or to his own manner of life. It is indeed true that
   Jeremiah speaks often in other places as a shepherd; that is, he uses
   common and free modes of speaking. It would not then be unnatural to
   suppose, that he put on the character of a shepherd when he spoke of
   tents. Both these views may however be combined, -- that he used a
   language common among shepherds, -- and that he shews that it was a
   mere mockery for the Jews to think that they could easily escape, as
   they had on their borders many fortified cities capable of resisting
   the attacks of their enemies. But no less suitable view would be this,
   -- That no corner would be safe; for their enemies would penetrate into
   the most retired places and destroy the smallest cottages, which might
   be resorted to as hiding -- places.

   He says suddenly, and in an instant, in order that the Jews might not
   promise themselves any time for negotiating, and thus procrastinate,
   and think that they would have time enough to make their peace with
   God. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [117] The literal reading may be thus, -- Breach upon breach has
   happened; For laid waste has been the whole land; Suddenly laid waste
   have been my tents, In a moment my curtains. He relates what he had
   seen in a vision, and therefore represents the whole as past. The verb
   qr' in Niphal as here, as well as in Kal, means sometimes to happen, to
   befall, to take place. The Syriac and the Targum give it here this
   meaning; and Blayney has adopted the same. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 4:21

   21. How long shall I see the standard, and hear the sound of the
   trumpet?

   21. Usquequo videbo vexillum? audiam vocem (vel, clangorem) tubae?


   He concludes that part of his discourse, which, as we have said, he
   embellished with figurative terms, in order more fully to rouse slow
   and torpid minds: but he confirms what he said at the beginning of the
   last verse

   (Jeremiah 4:20)
   "Distress has been summoned upon distress."

   He indeed repeats in other words the same thing, How long shall I see
   the standard, he says, and hear the sound of the trumpet? that is, "You
   are greatly deceived, if ye think that your enemies, after having for a
   short time marched through the land, will return home: for the evil of
   war will for a long time afflict you, and God will protract your
   calamities, so that the sound of trumpets will continue, and the
   standard will often, and even every day, be exhibited."

   We now then perceive the Prophet's meaning: He first shews, that though
   their enemies were afar off, they would yet come suddenly, and that the
   horses of God would be, according to what he said yesterday, swifter
   than eagles. He afterwards refers to the continued progress of the war;
   for it was necessary to shew to the Jews, that as they had long
   heedlessly despised God, so his vengeance would not be momentary, but
   would lie on them, so as to be without end.

   Now we ought to know that at this day there is no less dullness than
   among the Jews. It is therefore not enough to summon the ungodly and
   the wicked before God's tribunal, but such metaphorical language ought
   to be employed as may strike terror, and constrain them to fear, though
   they may endeavor in every way to harden their own consciences and
   stupefy themselves, so as to be capable of easily despising God. It is
   then necessary, that at the present day the servants of God should also
   speak more strongly and vehemently, that they may rouse hypocrites and
   the obstinate from their torpor. It then follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 4:22

   22. For my people is foolish, they have not known me; they are sottish
   children, and they have none understanding: they are wise to do evil,
   but to do good they have no knowledge.

   22. Quoniam stultus populus meus, me non cognovit; filii insipientes
   ipsi, et non intelligentes ipsi (sunt; chmh demonstrativum pronomen
   ponitur vice verbi:) astuti ipsi (vel, sapientes) ad malum; sed ad
   benefaciendum non intelligunt.


   The Prophet again teaches us, that the cause of these evils arose from
   the people themselves, and was to be found in them, so that they could
   not transfer it to anybody else. Hence he says, My people are foolish.
   He speaks here in the person of God; for it immediately follows, Me
   have they not known: this could not have been said by Jeremiah. God
   then complains here of the folly of his people; whom he so calls, not
   by way of honor, but that he might double their reproach; for nothing
   could have been more disgraceful than that the people, whom God had
   chosen as his peculiar inheritance, should be thus demented: for why
   had God chosen the seed of Abraham as his adopted children, but that
   they might be as lamps, carrying through the world the light of
   salvation?

   "What people in the world, "says Moses, "are so noble, who have gods so
   near them?" He says also, "This is thy knowledge and wisdom."
   (Deuteronomy 4:6, 7.)

   God then shews here that it was a monstrous thing, which all should
   regard with abhorrence, that his people should be foolish; as though he
   had said, "Can it be that a people whom I have chosen for myself, and
   with whom I have deposited the covenant of eternal salvation, whom I
   have instructed by my word -- that this people should so madly ruin
   themselves?"

   The people, then, are foolish, because they have not known me. He here
   expresses what was the cause of the foolishness or blindness of the
   people, even because they did not know God; for the knowledge of him is
   true wisdom. Now God thus shews that the madness of the people was
   inexcusable. How so? because he had made himself so familiarly known to
   them, that the Israelites had no occasion to ask, as Moses says, Who
   shall ascend into heaven, or who shall descend into the deep? for the
   word was set before them. (Deuteronomy 30:12-14.) As, then, God had so
   kindly manifested himself to the Jews, he justly complains that he was
   not known by them.

   There are then here two things to be noticed; first, the kind of
   madness that is here mentioned, -- the people did not know God. And we
   hence learn that then only are we wise when we fear God, and that we
   are always mad and senseless when we regard him not. This is one thing.
   Secondly, we must know that no excuse of ignorance or mistake was
   allowed to that people, for God had made himself known to them. And
   this may be applied to us: God will justly upbraid us at the last day,
   that we have been foolish and mad, if we are without the knowledge of
   him; for we have the means, as I have said, of knowing him; and there
   is no excuse that we can plead for our ignorance, since God has not
   spoken to us in an obscure manner. God in these words accused the Jews
   of ingratitude, and of deliberate wickedness, because they knew him
   not. But since God has at this day made himself more fully known to us,
   it is, as I have said, a heavier condemnation to us, and our punishment
   will thus be doubled, if we know not God, who is so kind to us, and
   deals with us so graciously.

   Then he adds, that they were foolish children, and not intelligent. The
   antithesis in Hebrew is more emphatical than in Greek and Latin; for to
   say, "He is foolish, and not wise, "would be in Greek and Latin frigid,
   as the last clause would be weaker than the former. But in Hebrew it is
   different; for in this way is conveyed the idea, that they were so
   foolish that not even the least portion of a sound mind remained in
   them. Even those who are foolish and senseless do yet retain some
   knowledge, however small it may be: hence they say, that the foolish
   often speak what is suitable. But the Prophet means another thing, --
   that the Jews were not only senseless and stupid, but that they were so
   destitute of all knowledge, that they were like stones or brute
   animals, and that they had not a particle of sound mind or of rational
   knowledge remaining in them. [118] The rest we shall defer to another
   time.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [118] The specific meaning of the terms used in this verse is not given
   in our version, nor by Calvin, nor by Blayney. The following, as I
   apprehend, is a literal version, -- For stupid are my people, Me they
   do not know; Foolish children are they, And undiscerning are they; Wise
   are they to do evil, But how to do good they know not. "Stupid," 'vyl,
   is one grossly ignorant, so as to be without knowledge, and not capable
   of knowing how to do good, or what is the good to be done. The last
   line explains the two first. Then "foolish," sklym, are the perverse,
   or the perverted, who are foolish through a perverted mind, who are
   said in the next line to be undiscerning, and who, as in the line which
   follows, had wisdom enough to do evil. They were stupidly ignorant, and
   perversely foolish. They were ignorant as to good, and wise as to evil;
   but this their wisdom was folly. -- Ed

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast not only once kindled among
   us the light of celestial truth, but also invitest us daily to partake
   of the salvation which has been set before us, -- O grant, that we may
   not close our eyes, nor render deaf our ears, nor harden ourselves in
   our sins, but that as thou ceasest not continually to call us to
   thyself, so we may earnestly strive to hasten to thee, and to persevere
   in the course of our holy calling, so that we may draw nearer daily to
   its end, until thou receivest us at length into that celestial kingdom,
   which has been obtained for us by the blood of thine only-begotten Son.
   -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 4:23-26

   23. I beheld the earth, and, lo, it was without form, and void; and the
   heavens, and they had no light.

   23. Vidi terram, et ecce vasta et deformis, et coelos, et nulla lux
   eorum:

   24. I beheld the mountains, and, lo, they trembled, and all the hills
   moved lightly.

   24. Vidi montes, et ecce contremiscentes (contremiscebant), et omnes
   colles movebantur:

   25. I beheld, and, lo, there was no man, and all the birds of the
   heavens were fled.

   25. Vidi, et ecce nullus homo, et omnes aves coelorum evolaverant:

   26. I beheld, and, lo, the fruitful place was a wilderness, and all the
   cities thereof were broken down at the presence of the Lord, and by his
   fierce anger.

   26. Vidi, et ecce regio foecunda (vel, carmelus) desertum, et omnes
   urbes ejus destructae a facie Jehovae, et a facie excandescentiae irae
   ejus.


   The Prophet in this passage enlarges in a language highly metaphorical
   on the terror of God's vengeance, that he might rouse the Jews, who
   were stupid and careless: nor is the repetition in vain, when he says
   four times, that he looked. He might have spoken of the earth, heaven,
   men, and fertile places in one sentence: but it is the same as though
   he had turned his eyes to four different quarters, and said, that
   wherever he looked, there appeared to him dreadful tokens of God's
   wrath, and which threatened the Jews with utter ruin. Nor is it a
   wonder that the Prophet is so vehement; for we know that men would have
   heedlessly received all threatenings, except they were violently
   roused. And this mode of teaching ought to be well known to us; for all
   in any degree acquainted with the writings of the prophets, must know
   that they especially pursued this course, in order to rouse hypocrites,
   and the despisers of God, who, with a stiff neck and a hardened heart,
   were not moved by any apprehension of punishment. But this passage is
   remarkable above most others: we ought therefore to consider the import
   of the Prophet's words.

   He says first, that he looked on the earth, and that it was thv, teu,
   and vhv, beu. He employs the very words which Moses adopted in his
   history of the creation; for before any order was introduced, he says
   that the earth was thv, teu, and vhv, beu, that is, waste and unformed
   chaos; and it had no beauty pleasing to the eye. [119] It is the same
   as though He had said, that the order, which had been so beautifully
   arranged, had now disappeared through God's wrath, and that there was
   nothing but confusion everywhere. Thus he amplifies the atrocity of
   their sins; as though he had said, that men had become so fallen, that
   they had changed the whole form of the world, and blended heaven and
   earth together, so that now there was no distinction between things. As
   to the heavens, he says, that there was no light in them: he intimates
   that the light of the sun, moon, and stars, was in a manner
   extinguished, because men were unworthy to enjoy such a kindness from
   God; and as though the sun and moon were ashamed to be witnesses of so
   many sins and vices.

   We now then apprehend what Jeremiah chiefly means in the first verse:
   He says, that he looked on the earth, and that nothing appeared in it
   but dreadful chaos and waste, there being no form nor beauty; for the
   Jews had by their sins subverted the order of nature and the creation
   of God. And he says, that he looked on the heavens, and that they had
   no light; for the Jews had deserved to be deprived of that benefit
   which God had designed the sun and the moon to convey: and it is indeed
   a singular instance of God's kindness, that he has made such noble
   objects to be of such service to us. The Prophet, in short, means that
   such awful tokens of God's wrath appeared in heaven and on earth, as
   though the whole world had been thrown into confusion. This mode of
   speaking often occurs in the other prophets, especially in Joel 2:2.
   Though the words are hyperbolical, yet they do not exceed what is
   suitable, if we take to the account the extreme insensibility of men:
   for except God arms heaven and earth, and shews himself ready to take
   away all the blessings with which he favors mankind, they will, as we
   have lately said, laugh to scorn all his threatenings.

   Jeremiah descends afterwards from heaven to mountains, and says that
   they trembled, and that all the hills moved or shook; some say,
   destroyed, but I know not for what reason, for the Prophet no doubt
   confirms the same thing by another phrase: and as he had said, that
   mountains trembled, so he also adds, that hills shook; and this is the
   proper meaning of the verb. Now the reason why he speaks of mountains
   and hills is evident; for a greater stability seems to belong to them
   than to level grounds, inasmuch as mountains are for the most part
   stony, and have their roots most firmly fixed in rocks. Were indeed the
   whole world to be thrown into confusion, the mountains seem to be so
   firmly based that no commotion could affect them: but the Prophet says,
   that they trembled, and that the hills shook

   What he saw the third time was solitude; for he says that there were no
   men, and that all birds had fled away. The principal ornament of the
   world, we know, consists of men and of living creatures. For why was
   the earth made so productive, that it brings forth fruits, so many and
   so various, except for the sake of men and of animals? Though, then,
   the earth appears very beautiful on account of its trees, herbs, and
   every kind of fruit, yet its principal ornaments are men and animals.
   By stating a part for the whole, the Prophet, by mentioning birds,
   includes all earthly animals: he says then, that the earth was emptied
   of its inhabitants.

   What he saw the fourth time was this -- that the fertile land was
   turned into a desert. I indeed think that Carmel is to be taken here as
   meaning the place. That part of the holy land, we know, received its
   name from its fertility: Carmel means any rich and fruitful spot of
   ground. But, as I have just said, the mount was so called because it
   abounded in all kinds of produce; for there were on it fruitful
   pastures and fertile fields, and every part of it was remarkably
   pleasant and delightful. I am therefore inclined to consider Carmel
   itself to be meant here; and my reason is, because he immediately adds,
   that its cities were destroyed; and this can be more fitly applied to
   Carmel than generally to all fruitful regions. As to myself, I think
   that the Prophet speaks of Carmel; and yet he alludes to what the word
   means. [120] Even in this verse he mentions a part for the whole, as
   though he had said, that Carmel, which excelled in fertility, had
   become like a desert. When Isaiah speaks of the renovation of the
   Church, he says,

   "The desert shall be as Carmel," (Isaiah 32:15)

   as though he had said, that the blessing of God would be so abundant
   through the whole world, that deserts would bear fruit like Carmel, or
   those regions which are remarkable for their fertility. But Jeremiah,
   speaking here of a curse, says, that Carmel would be like the desert;
   and that all its cities would be demolished, even at the presence of
   Jehovah, and by the great heat of his wrath

   Some render chrvn, charun, fury: and this kind of language is not
   without its use; for men, as we have said, except God terrifies them as
   it were by thunders, will sleep and will not perceive his judgment, so
   that all threatenings become useless to them. This is the reason why
   Scripture speaks so often of the fury or of the great heat of God's
   wrath. Either of the two words might indeed be sufficient; either
   chrvn, charun, which means fury or great heat; or 'ph aph, which
   signifies anger or wrath. Why then are both mentioned? because it is
   necessary, as I have said, to tear in pieces our hardness as with
   hammers; for otherwise God could never turn us to fear him. This
   repetition then ought to avail for the purpose of subduing the
   perverseness of our nature; not that these turbulent feelings belong to
   God, as it is well known; but as we cannot otherwise conceive how
   dreadful his vengeance is, it is necessary that he should be set before
   us as one who is angry and burning with wrath: in a like manner,
   eternal death is described to us under the metaphor of fire.

   Now, as to the sum of what is here said, the Jews at that time no doubt
   enjoyed great abundance and indulged their pleasures; in short, they
   were fully pleased with their condition. But the Prophet here declares
   that he saw at a distance what these blind Jews did not see, even God's
   vengeance approaching, which would deprive them of that abundance, on
   account of which they were so swollen with pride, and which would
   reduce them all into such a state of desolation that nothing would
   remain above or below, but a disordered confusion, such as existed
   before nature was brought to order, when the earth was not separated
   from the heavens, and there was only a confused mass, including all the
   elements, and without any light. He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [119] These two words are viewed as synonymous by some, and the
   versions render them often by the same terms. As to the first, thv,
   there can be no doubt as to its meaning, for it occurs about twenty
   times, and in all these places the idea of emptiness is chiefly
   conveyed: hence it is most commonly rendered in our version, vain,
   vanity, in vain, nought, etc., 1 Samuel 12:21; Isaiah 40:17; Isaiah
   45:18; Isaiah 49:4. It is improperly rendered "without form," in
   Genesis 1:2, and "confusion" in Isaiah 34:11. When applied to the
   earth, as in Genesis 1:2, it imports emptiness, as it was then
   unfurnished either with productions or with any inhabitants. This
   appears evident from Isaiah 45:18, "He created it not in vain," rather,
   "not empty did he create it -- l'-thv vr'h;" "he formed it to be
   inhabited," or more literally, "for a habitation he formed it." As to
   the other word, vvv, it only occurs three times, Genesis 1:2; Isaiah
   34:11; and here. As the former evidently means emptiness, this may be
   taken to mean confusion or chaos, according to Symmachus,
   "sunkechumene, -- confused." Then the right rendering here would be, --
   23. I looked on the land, And behold emptiness and confusion; And
   towards the heavens, And they were without their light. It is not the
   earth, but the land of Judea is what is meant. The whole passage being
   so striking, shall be here given, -- 24. I looked at the mountains,
   And, behold, they were shaking, And all the hills made quick motions:
   25. I looked, and, behold, there was no man; And every bird of heaven
   had fled away: 26. I looked, and, behold, Carmel a desert; And all its
   cities had been demolished By the presence of Jehovah, By the
   indignation of his wrath. The whole is represented as already done. The
   Prophet speaks of what he had seen in the vision. -- Ed.

   [120] All the early versions, as well as the Targum, retain the word
   "Carmel." Blayney renders it "the fruitful field." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 4:27

   27. For thus hath the Lord said, The whole land shall be desolate; yet
   will I not make a full end.

   27. Quia sic dicit Jehova, Desolata erit (vasta, perdita erit) tota
   terra; et finem (vel, consumptionem) non faciam (atque tunc copula
   resolvetur in adversativam, non tamen consumptionem faciam.)


   The Prophet briefly explains here what he understood by the four things
   which he had seen and of which he had spoken. He then declares, as it
   were in the person of God, that there would be a dreadful desolation
   throughout Judea; Wasted, he says, shall be the whole land, or, in the
   whole land there shall be desolation. Some explain what afterwards
   follows, as though he mitigated the severity of his language. Hence, as
   they think, a mitigation is added, which was to relieve the faithful
   with some hope of mercy, lest they should wholly despond. And indeed
   were he to threaten only he might fill a hundred worlds with terror.
   Lest then despair should so overwhelm the faithful as to restrain them
   from fleeing to God for mercy, it is often added by way of mitigation,
   that God would not consume the whole land.

   The word klh, cale, sometimes means perfection, but in most places,
   consummation; for the verb signifies to perfect and to consume, and for
   the same reason. Though these two things seem inconsistent, yet what is
   consumed is said to be perfected, for it comes to an end. If this
   explanation is approved, we now see the reason why he declares that he
   would not make a consummation, with whatever severity he might punish
   the sins of his people; it was, that some hope might remain for the
   faithful, so that they might not be wholly discouraged; which would
   have been the case had not God promised to be propitious and mindful of
   his covenant.

   Some perhaps may approve of reading the sentence as a question, and
   think that the object is to beat down the pride of the ungodly, and to
   dissipate the boasting of those who relied on the hope of impunity; as
   though he had said, "Do ye still deny that I shall make a
   consummation?"

   Now, though the former exposition contains a richer truth, yet I prefer
   to take klh, cale, as signifying an end, as though he had declared that
   he would observe no moderation in executing his vengeance: [121] and a
   similar language occurs in the next chapter. The real meaning then is,
   -- that God would to the end carry on his work of desolation. The
   prophets indeed do not always speak alike when they announce God's
   judgments. Sometimes they denounce ruin where none seems to be safe;
   yet God ever preserves some hidden seed, as it is said in Isaiah 1:9;
   where also it appears evident what the prophets understood by making a
   consummation. For God there threatens and says,

   "Behold I will make a consummation;" yet he afterwards adds, "The
   consummation shall bring forth fruit,"

   that is, what remained of the consummation. The prophets elsewhere
   compare the Church of God to olive -- trees when shaken, or to vines
   after vintage, (Isaiah 17:6; Isaiah 24:13;) for some grapes ever remain
   which escape the eyes of the gatherers; so also, when the olive --
   trees are shaken, some fruit remain on the highest branches. Thus God
   says, that the consummation he makes in his Church is like the vintage
   or the shaking of olive -- trees, when some fruit remain and escape the
   eyes of the gatherers. We now perceive what the Prophet means, -- that
   there would be the ruin of the whole people, so that they would have
   neither a name nor existence as a body; which thing also happened, when
   they were driven as exiles into Babylon; for the people, as a civil
   community, then ceased to exist, so that there was an end made of them.

   I indeed allow that God's threatenings cannot avail for our salvation,
   unless connected with the promise of pardon, so that being raised up by
   the hope of salvation we may flee to him: for as long as we deem God
   inexorable, we shun every access to him; and thus despair drives us
   into a rage like that of fiends. Hence it is that the reprobate rage so
   much against God, and make a great clamor: and they would willingly
   thrust him from his throne. It is therefore necessary that a hope of
   salvation should be set before us, so that we may be touched with
   repentance: and as this promise is perpetual, whatever may happen, even
   if earth and heaven were mixed together, and ruin on every side were
   filling us with dread, we must still remember that there will be ever
   some remnant according to the passages we have referred to in the first
   and tenth chapters of Isaiah. But as the people were not prepared to
   receive consolation, the design of the Prophet here is different, for
   he only mentions punishment. He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [121] All the early versions and the Targum favor the former view, as
   they all render the sentence, "Yet a consummation I will not make."
   Gataker mentions another explanation, "I will not yet make a full end"
   with you; that is, I will punish you yet farther: and reference is made
   to Jeremiah 5:18. This view is adopted by Blayney and Scott. But the
   former view is no doubt the right one; for this is the meaning of the
   phrase as found in other places; see Jeremiah 30:11; where it is clear
   that klh sh is wholly to destroy. See also Nehemiah 9:31; Ezekiel
   11:13; Ezekiel 20:17; Nahum 1:9. The meaning then is, "Yet I will not
   make an entire destruction." Henry takes this view, and Lowth seems to
   prefer it. Indeed the phrase has no other meaning wherever it is used.

   Jeremiah 4:28

   28. For this shall the earth mourn, and the heavens above be black:
   because I have spoken it, I have purposed it, and will not repent,
   neither will I turn back from it.

   28. Super hoc lugebit terra, et nigrescent (vel, caligine aut nigredine
   obducti erunt) coeli desursum (nescio tamen an posset verti, a
   transgressione; nam ml significat etiam transgredi et inquietare;) quia
   1oquutus sum; cogitavi et non poenituit, et non convertar ab hoc.


   Jeremiah proceeds here with the same subject, and still introduces God
   as the speaker, that what is said might produce a greater effect. For
   this, he says, the land shall mourn. The mourning of the land is to be
   taken for its desolation; but he refers to what he had said before. He
   does not speak of the inhabitants of the land; for they who thus
   explain the passage, diminish much the force of the expression; for the
   Prophet here ascribes terror and sorrow to the very elements, which is
   much more striking than if he said, that all men would be in sorrow and
   grief. The same also must be thought of the heavens. Indeed, the latter
   clause proves that he does not speak of the inhabitants, but of the
   land itself, which, though without reason, seems yet to dread God's
   vengeance. And thus the Prophet upbraids men with their insensibility;
   for when God appeared as judge from heaven, they were not touched with
   any fear. Mourn then shall the land, and covered shall be the heaven
   with darkness; that is, though men remain stupid, yet both heaven and
   earth shall feel how dreadful God's judgment will be.

   He afterwards adds, Because I have spoken. Some consider 'sr, asher,
   what, to be understood between this sentence and the following verb:
   "Because I have spoken what I have purposed, and I have not repented."
   But the concise phrase is not unsuitable: God first intimates, that he
   had pronounced the sentence, which would remain firm and unchangeable;
   as though he had said, "I have once for all declared by my servants
   what I will do." For the prophets, we know, were the heralds of God's
   vengeance: and as their doctrine was often despised, so at this day
   also the world obstinately rejects it; and as it often now derides all
   threatenings, so it happened then. But Jeremiah introduces here God as
   the speaker, as though he had said, "My servants have been despised by
   you; but they have said nothing but what I have commanded them: I am
   therefore the author of that sentence by which you ought to have been
   moved and roused." In this sense it is that God testifies that he had
   spoken; for he transfers to himself what the Jews thought proceeded
   from the prophets, and hence supposed that they were at liberty to
   regard as nothing what the prophets pronounced against them: "I myself
   am He," says God, "who has spoken." So that we must understand a
   contrast here between God and the prophets; as though he had said, that
   the Jews in vain slumbered in their sins, because they thought they had
   to do only with mortals, since God himself had commanded his servants
   to denounce the ruin that was despised.

   But that they might not think that God had thus spoken to cause a false
   alarm, (for hypocrites flatter themselves with this pretense, that God
   does not speak seriously, but that he frightens them with bugbears, as
   children are wont to be,) he says, that he had purposed. He had said
   before that he had spoken, that is, by his prophets; but what he means
   now by this word is, that the predictions which he had made known as to
   their destruction proceeded from his own secret counsel: "This," he
   says, "has been decreed by me."

   He then adds, It has not repented me, and I will not turn from it. He
   briefly shews, that the Jews were now given up to death, that they
   might not think that God could be pacified as long as they followed
   their vices; for God had decreed to destroy them; and he had not only
   declared this by his prophets, but had also resolved within himself to
   do so. By the term repent, is to be understood a change; for God
   cannot, strictly speaking, repent, as nothing is hid from him; but he
   speaks, as I have lately stated, after a human manner: and every
   ambiguity is removed by the next phrase, when he says, I will not turn
   from it, that is, "I will not retract my sentence." [122] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [122] The latter part is very concise, -- Because I have said, I have
   purposed, And have not repented, And I will not turn from it. The
   turning refers to what he had said, and repentance to the purpose.
   Blayney followed the Septuagint, and changed the order of the words,
   and thus destroyed the right connection of the passage, and the common
   parallelism of the language. We may also notice this passage as an
   instance of what is often found both in the Old Testament, and also in
   the New, -- that when two or more things are consecutively stated, the
   most obvious, the most apparent, is mentioned first, and then the most
   hidden, or what is in order previous. Purpose is first in order, but
   speaking is first mentioned. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 4:29

   29. The whole city shall flee for the noise of the horsemen and bowmen;
   they shall go into thickets, and climb up upon the rocks: every city
   shall be forsaken, and not a man dwell therein.

   29. A voce equitis et jaculantis arcu fugiet omnis civitas; penetrabunt
   (vel, ingredientur) in densitates (alii, in nubes; myv significat
   densitates, ut sunt loca arboribus perplexa, significat etiam nubes;
   potius hic existimo accipi pro nubibus, quia sequitur,) ascendent in
   rupes (postea:) omnis civitas relicta erit, et nullus vir habitabit in
   illis.


   By saying, that at the voice or sound of horsemen and bowmen, there
   would be an universal flight, he means, that the enemies would come
   with such impetuosity, that the Jews would not dare to wait for their
   presence, but would flee here and there before they were attacked: for
   the word voice or sound, no doubt, is set here in opposition to wounds.
   They did swell, we know, with amazing pride; hence the Prophet
   ridicules that false confidence by which they were so inebriated as not
   to dread God's judgment: "The sound alone of enemies," he says, "will
   frighten you; so that all the cities, being left by their inhabitants,
   will easily fall into their hands, for walls will not defend
   themselves; nay, the gates will be open." Flee then will every city;
   that is, all the cities will have recourse to flight. Then it follows,
   Ascend will they into the clouds, or into thicknesses: this may be
   applied to the enemies, to shew that they would be so nimble and active
   as to fly, as it were, to the clouds, and climb the highest rocks. But
   I prefer to connect this sentence with the former, as intimating, that
   to ascend the clouds would not be too arduous for the Jews in their
   anxious flight. Inasmuch as the tops of mountains were often covered
   with thick trees, in order to form a dark shade, this passage may mean,
   that they fled to such places. However this may have been, the Prophet
   here, no doubt, refers to such high situations. Hence, the meaning
   would be more evident if we retain the word, clouds. As to what is
   intended, we see that that is clear; which is, that the enemies of the
   Jews would in swiftness be equal to the eagles while pursuing them; or,
   what is more commonly thought, that the terror felt by the Jews would
   be so great, that in their flight they would not seek recesses nigh at
   hand, but would flee to the highest tops of mountains, and hide
   themselves there among the trees, as though they had climbed into the
   clouds. They would ascend into craggy rocks, as they could not think
   themselves otherwise safe from the attacks of their enemies. [123]

   He then adds, that every city would be forsaken, so that no one would
   dwell in them. We see that the Prophet had ever this in view -- to
   rouse the Jews, who had deaf ears and stony hearts, so that they felt
   no concern for their own calamities, and even boldly despised God, as
   though they had made a covenant with death, according to what is said
   in another place. (Isaiah 28:15.) He afterwards subjoins --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [123] The verbs in this are all in the past tense, as in some former
   instances. The Prophet had already seen in a vision what he here
   states, -- At the voice (or sound) of the rider and of the handler of
   the bow, Flee did every city; They went into thickets, and into cliffs
   they climbed; Every city was forsaken, And dwell in them did no man.
   The word for "thickets" means sometimes "clouds." The verb signifies to
   be dense, thick, gross, bulky: but the plural noun means a thick wood,
   as well as a thick or dense mass of vapors, which form clouds. It is
   rendered "alse, -- forests," by the Septuagint and Syriac; and "sylvas
   -- woods," by the Targum. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 4:30

   30. And when thou art spoiled, what wilt thou do? Though thou clothest
   thyself with crimson, though thou deckest thee with ornaments of gold,
   though thou rentest thy face with painting, in vain shalt thou make
   thyself fair; thy lovers will despise thee, they will seek thy life.

   30. Et tu perdita (aut, vastata) quid facies? Quamvis to induas
   coccino, quamvis to ornes ornamentis auri (vel, monilibus aureis, ut
   alii vertunt,) quamvis distinguas fuco (aut, stybio, ut alii vertunt,)
   oculos tuos, frustra to decorabis (ad verbum, pulchrificabis;)
   abominabuntur to amatores tui, animam tuam quaerent.


   The Prophet boldly ridicules the Jews, in order to cast down their
   pride and haughtiness. It was indeed his object to check that pride
   with which they were elated against God. The Prophet could not have
   done this without assuming a higher strain than usual, and by rendering
   his discourse more striking by using metaphorical words. It is indeed
   the language of derision; he exclaims, What wilt thou do, thou wretched
   one? The Jews had hitherto been inflated with contempt towards God, and
   their high spirits had not been subdued. Since, then, their haughtiness
   continued untamed, the Prophet cries out and says, "Thou wretched, what
   wilt thou do?" as though he had said, "In vain do they flatter
   themselves and promise themselves aid from this and from that quarter,
   for their condition is past any remedy." [124]

   He afterwards adds, Though, etc.; for so I consider the connection of
   the verse; and they seem right to me who do not separate the words of
   the Prophet. But the view which others take appears frigid, "Who now
   adornest thyself, who now clothest thyself in scarlet, who adornest
   thyself with ornaments of gold, who paintest thy eyes black." To no
   purpose do they introduce the relative, for it renders the meaning of
   the Prophet different from what it really is.

   These parts follow one another, and the principal verb is found in
   these words, In vain dost thou adorn thyself; and the particle kyis to
   be rendered "though."

   There are those who consider ceremonies to be intended, as hypocrites
   think that they are by these protected against God's judgment: but this
   view is unsuitable and wholly alien to what is here set forth. It is
   indeed true, that ceremonies are to hypocrites dens of thieves, as we
   shall hereafter see, (Jeremiah 7:11;) but the Prophet in this place
   refers to meretricious ornaments; for the people, as it had before
   appeared, were become like an adulterous woman. God had formed with
   them as it were a marriage -- contract; they had violated it; and this
   perfidy was like the defection of an adulteress, who leaves her husband
   and wanders here and there, and lives as a prostitute. As then harlots,
   for the purpose of enticement, are wont to dress themselves elegantly,
   to paint their faces, and to use other allurements, the Prophet says,
   "In vain wilt thou adorn thyself; though thou puttest on scarlet,
   though thou shinest with gold even from the head to the feet, yet all
   this will be superfluous and useless; and though, in addition to all
   this, thou paintest thy face, [125] it will yet avail thee nothing."

   Now, we know whom he understands by lovers, even the Egyptians and the
   Assyrians. For the Jews, when oppressed by the Egyptians, were wont to
   seek help from the Assyrians; and again, when attacked by the
   Assyrians, they became suppliants to the Egyptians. The prophets
   compared this sort of conduct to that of strumpets; for whenever they
   courted the aid of either of these parties, they broke the bond of
   marriage, by which they were connected with God, and perfidiously
   violated their pledged faith. Hence, the Prophet says, "Even if the
   Egyptians promise wonderful things to thee, as a lover allured by thy
   beauty and by thy meretricious ornaments, yet they will deceive thee;
   and if the Assyrians shew themselves ready to bring aid, they also will
   disappoint thy hope: so that thou shalt be like a destitute strumpet,
   reduced to extreme want." I cannot finish today: I must therefore defer
   the rest until to-morrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [124] The words "thou wretched," or, more commonly, "thou spoiled," are
   left out in the Septuagint and Arabic, and are retained in this sense
   by the Vulgate, Syriac, and the Targum. But, as Blayney justly says, it
   is a rendering that is not correct. "Thou," as in the received text, is
   feminine, and "spoiled" is masculine. The Keri and many MSS. have 't
   instead of 'ty; and sdvd, as Blayney supposes, is not a passive
   participle, but a verb in the infinitive mood, used as a noun. So he
   gives this version, -- And against spoiling what wilt thou do? The word
   "spoiled," or wasted, may indeed refer to "every city," mentioned in
   the former verse, and the word for city is masculine. We may then
   render thus, -- And the city being wasted, what wilt thou do? "The
   city" may be deemed as the poetical singular for the plural. -- Ed.

   [125] The Septuagint, the Vulgate, and the Targum give this rendering,
   -- "Though thou paintest with stibium thine eyes." The Hebrew literally
   is, as it is rendered by Blayney, -- Though thou distendest with paint
   thy eyes. The verb qr, means first to rend, to divide, and then to
   divide in the sense of distending or enlarging. Large eyes were
   considered a beauty, and women used a sort of paint, or rather powder,
   for the purpose of enlarging them. See Lowth's note on Isaiah 3:16, and
   Parkhurst under the word phk. -- Ed

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that though we are torpid in our vices, we may yet
   be attentive to these examples of thy wrath, by which thou designest to
   warn us, so that we may learn by the misery of others to fear thee: and
   may we be also attentive to those threatenings, by which thou drawest
   us to thee, as thou failest to allure us by thy kindness: and may we,
   in the meantime, feel assured that thou wilt ever be propitious and
   merciful to all miserable sinners, who will from the heart seek thee
   and sincerely and unfeignedly repent; so that we may contend with our
   vices, and with real effort strive to deliver ourselves from those
   snares of Satan which he ever spreads for us, in order that we may more
   freely devote ourselves altogether to thee, and take such delight in
   thy righteousness, that our object and aim through the whole course of
   our life may be to please thee, and to render our services approved in
   Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   Lecture Eighteenth

   WE stated, yesterday, what the Prophet meant by the scarlet clothing,
   by the golden ornaments, and by the painting, which he mentions, even
   those delusive crafts, which the princes and the people employed in
   forming confederacies; for they ever acted perfidiously. But it was
   also said, that the Prophet refers to the spiritual marriage which God
   had formed with the people of Israel; for a kind of adultery was
   committed, when they sought foreign alliances; as they thus denied God,
   being not satisfied with his protection. As a wife considers herself
   sufficiently protected by her husband, so the Israelites ought to have
   depended on God only: but inasmuch as they ran here and there,
   following their own vagrant desires, the Prophet justly compares them
   to adulterous women.

   But he says, that they would be an abomination to their lovers; and not
   only so, but that both the Egyptians and the Assyrians, in whom they
   foolishly trusted, would be their worst enemies: Hate thee, he says,
   shall thy lovers; [126] yea, they will seek thy life; that is, those
   aids, by which thou thinkest to become safe and secure, will be for thy
   destruction. It then follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [126] Rather, -- Rejected thee have paramours. This is the meaning of
   the verb when followed as here by v. See note on Jeremiah 2:37. The
   word for paramours means not lovers, but lewd or mad lovers. The verb
   is rendered "to dote upon," Ezekiel 23:12. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 4:31

   31. For I have heard a voice as of a woman in travail, and the anguish
   as of her that bringeth forth her first child, the voice of the
   daughter of Zion, that bewaileth herself, that spreadeth her hands,
   saying, Woe is me now! for my soul is wearied because of murderers.

   31. Certa vocem parturientis audivi, afflictionem (vel, anxietatem)
   quasi puerperae (vel, parientis primogenitum; nam proprie hoc
   significat nomen) vocem filiae Sion; lugebit (vel, conqueretur, vel,
   ingemiscet,) scindet (vel, extender, ut alii vertunt, vel, confliget)
   manus suas: Vae nunc mihi, quia defecit anima mea propter interfectos
   (alii active, propter interfectores.)


   By these words Jeremiah confirms what the latter part of the preceding
   verse contains: nor was it for the sake of elucidating his subject that
   he enlarged on it; but when he saw his own nation so hard and almost
   like stones, he employed many words and set forth in various ways what
   he might have expressed in one sentence: and what he taught would have
   been often coldly received, had he not added exhortations and
   threatenings. It was on this account that he now expresses in other
   words what he had previously said, I have heard, he says, the voice as
   of one in labor This hearing, no doubt, is to be taken consistently
   with the representation which had been made to him; for Jeremiah could
   not hear in a way different from others; but he speaks according to the
   discovery made to him of the approaching judgment of God, which was
   then unheeded by the people; and he had this discovery, that he might
   by such a representation as this make it known to them. He then says,
   that he had heard, as though he had witnessed already all that was to
   come. He then exaggerates the evil; for he puts distress, tsrh, tsere,
   instead of "voice," qvl, kul; and then he mentions, as an instance of
   greater pain, a woman bringing forth her first -- born, instead of a
   woman in labor. Then Jeremiah means, that final ruin was nigh that
   people who could not then be restored from their sinful courses; but he
   intimates, as also the Spirit speaks in other places, that their
   destruction would be sudden; while they would be saying, Peace and
   security, sudden destruction would come upon them. (1 Thessalonians
   5:3.) And so the Prophet now declares, that the Jews in vain hardened
   themselves against God, as though their ruin was not approaching, for
   their sorrow would come suddenly. As a woman may be cheerful at meat or
   at her leisure, and may be suddenly seized with the pain of labor, so
   also the Prophet shews, that the Jews had no reason to think that they
   could escape God's vengeance by a false confidence, for their
   destruction would come upon them unexpectedly.

   He sets forth at the same time, as already said, the greatness or the
   extremity of their grief by this similitude, The voice of the daughter
   of Sion, who complains, etc.; for the relative may be here added. Some
   take the verb to be in the second person, "Thou wilt lament and extend,
   "or rend, "thy hands;" but this is not suitable, because the third
   person is immediately used, "thy hands." Then what he says is, that the
   voice of the daughter of Sion would be an evidence of her extreme
   grief, for she would lament; and he adds, at the same time, the smiting
   of the hands. This verb is variously rendered; but as phrs, peresh,
   means properly to rend or to divide, I think the Prophet expresses the
   posture of a woman in grief; for she usually smites her hands together
   and as it were divides them by putting the fingers between one another.
   Some render the word "expand, "for the hands are divided when raised
   up. As to what is meant, there is nothing ambiguous in the Prophet's
   words; for his object is to shew, that God's vengeance would be so
   dreadful, that the Jews would lament, not in an ordinary measure, but
   like women, when in the extreme pain of labor.

   He then concludes by saying, Woe to me, for failed has my soul on
   account of murderers Here the Prophet intimates, that all the rest were
   blind in the midst of light, yet God's judgment, which the ungodly and
   wicked laughed at, or at least disregarded, was seen clearly by him.
   His soul, he says, fainted for the slain; and yet no one had hitherto
   been slain: but by this mode of speaking, he shews, that he had as it
   were before his eyes what was hid from others, and hence their hearts
   were not affected. [127] Now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [127] This latter part is differently taken by most. It is considered
   to be the confession of the daughter of Sion. The whole verse is
   remarkably striking, -- For the voice as of one in travail have I
   heard, The distress as of one giving birth to a first-born, The voice
   of the daughter of Sion; Who pants for breath, who spreads her hands,
   -- "Wo now to me, For melted has my soul because of murderers." It is a
   common thing in Hebrew to omit the relative "who," before a verb in a
   future tense, especially when it means the present time. The scene is
   described as present. The passage might be expressed in Welsh without
   the relative. "Who pants for breath," is rendered by Horsley, "that
   draweth her breath short;" and he adds, "The passage is a most
   affecting picture of the last struggles of a woman expiring in labor."
   -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 5
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 5:1

   1. Run ye to and fro through the streets of Jerusalem, and see now, and
   know, and seek in the broad places thereof, if ye can find a man, if
   there be any that executeth judgment, that seeketh the truth; and I
   will pardon it.

   1. Circuite per vias (alii vertunt, inquirite, vel, explorate, vel,
   investigate per vias) Jerusalem, et videte, agedum, (hic enim 'n est
   hortantis, proximo versu debuit verti nunc, vae nunc mihi,) et
   cognoscite, et inquirite, in vicis ejus (in compitis ejus,) an
   invenietis virum, an erit quifaciat judicium (hoc est, rectitudinem,)
   qui quaerat veritatem, et parcam illi.


   In this verse, as in those which follow, God shews that he was not too
   rigid or too severe in denouncing utter ruin on his people, because
   their wickedness was wholly incurable, and no other mode of treating
   them could be found. We, indeed, know that it is often testified in
   Scripture, that God is patient and waits until sinners repent. Since
   then God everywhere extols his kindness, and promises to be merciful
   even to the worst if they repent, and since he of his own accord
   anticipates sinners, it may appear strange that he rises with so much
   severity against his own Church. But we know how refractory the ungodly
   are; and hence they hesitate not to expostulate with God, and willfully
   accuse him, as though he treated them with cruelty. It is then for this
   reason, that God now shews that he was not, as it were, at liberty to
   forgive the people; "Even if I would, "he says, "I could not." He
   speaks, indeed, after the manner of men; but in this way, as I have
   said, he shews that he tried all expedients, before he had recourse to
   extreme severity, but that there was no remedy, on account of the
   desperate wickedness of the people. And this is what the words fully
   express.

   Go round, [128] he says, through the streets of Jerusalem, and see, I
   pray, and know; inquire through all the cross-ways Jeremiah might have
   said in one sentence, "If one man be found in the city, I am ready to
   forgive: "but God here permits the whole world to inquire diligently
   and carefully what was the state of the holy city, which ever gloried
   in that title. But he now, as also in the next verse, speaks of
   Jerusalem. He had spoken also of the neighboring cities; but as the
   holiness of the whole land seemed then to have its seat and habitation
   at Jerusalem, God here addresses that city, which as yet retained some
   appearance of sanctity, and excelled other cities. He then says,
   Inquire, see, know, look, whether there is a man, etc. He allows here
   all men to form a judgment, as though he had said, "Let all be present,
   since the Jews seek to create an ill-will towards me, and complain of
   too much rigor, as though I treated them unhumanly; let all who wish
   come as judges, let them inquire, ask, make a thorough search; and when
   it shall be found out that there is not in it even one just man, what
   else can be done, but that the city must be destroyed? for what can be
   done to the abandoned and irreclaimable, except I execute my judgment
   on them?"

   We now understand the Prophet's object; for he intended here to shut
   the mouths of the Jews, and to expose their slanders, that they might
   not clamor against God or blame his judgment, as though it exceeded the
   limits of moderation: and he shews also, that though God was disposed
   to pardon, there was yet no place for pardon, and that his mercy was
   excluded by their untamable obstinacy, since there was not one man in
   Jerusalem who had any regard for uprightness.

   Here, however, a question may be started, Why does Jeremiah say that no
   good man could be found, since he himself was at Jerusalem, and his
   friend Baruch, and some others, an account of whom we shall hereafter
   find? There were then in the city some true servants of God, and some
   as yet remained who had true religion, though the number was small. It
   appears then that the language is hyperbolical.

   But we must observe, that the Prophet here speaks of the people to the
   exclusion of the faithful. That this may appear more evident, we must
   remember a passage in the eighth chapter of Isaiah,

   "Seal the law and bind the testimony for my disciples,"
   (Isaiah 8:16;)

   where it appears that God saw that he sent his Prophet in vain, and
   that his labors were spent in vain among a people wholly irreclaimable.
   Hence he says, "Bind the testimony and seal the law among the
   disciples." We see that God gathered as it were together the few in
   whom remained any seed of true religion, yea, in whose hearts any
   religion was found. They were not then numbered with the people. So now
   Jeremiah did not consider Baruch and a few others as forming a part of
   that reprobate people; and he speaks, as it has been stated, of the
   community in general; for there were some separated from the rest, not
   only by the secret counsel of God, but according to the judgment that
   had been pronounced. He hence truly declares, that there was not one
   just man.

   We ought also to consider with whom he was then contending. On the one
   side were the king and his counselors, who, inflated with the promises,
   which they perverted, did not think it possible that the throne of
   David would fall.

   "This is my rest for ever -- As long as the sun and moon shall be, they
   shall be my witnesses in heaven, that thy seed shall never fail."
   (Psalm 132:14; Psalm 89:37, 38.)

   With such words were they armed. But as hypocrites falsely claim God's
   promises, so these unprincipled men boasted that God was on their side.
   Jeremiah had also to fight with another party, as we shall hereafter
   see, that is, with a host of false prophets; for there was a greater
   number of them, as is ever to be found in the world. The whole priestly
   order was corrupt, and openly carrying on war with God; and the people
   were nothing better. Jeremiah then had to contend with the king and his
   counselors, with the false prophets, with the ungodly priests, and with
   the wicked people. So he says, that there was not one man among them
   who engaged himself in appeasing God's wrath.

   To seek judgment is the same thing as to labor for uprightness: for the
   word mspht, meshephet means rectitude, or equity, or the rule of acting
   justly. He says then, that there was no one who practiced what was
   just; that there was no one who sought the truth Truth, as in a verse
   that follows, is to be taken for integrity, honesty; as though he had
   said, that all were given to falsehoods and frauds and crafts. It was
   therefore impossible that God should have been propitious to the city;
   for the relative h after l, being of the feminine gender, cannot be
   otherwise applied than to Jerusalem. God then says, that he would be
   merciful to it, if there could be found a just man among the king's
   counselors, or among the priests, or among the prophets: but they had
   all united together in opposition to everything just and right. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [128] Our version is, "Run ye to and fro," which has been taken from
   the Septuagint-peridrumete; but this is a more correct rendering. The
   Vulgate is "circuite -- go round;" the Syriac is the same. "Streets"
   were the narrow ones, the lanes; and what Calvin renders "the
   cross-ways," and our version "broad places," were the wide streets, or
   the squares. In the former the poor people lived, and in the latter the
   great people, the chief men of the city. The examination was to extend
   to all the inhabitants. First, it takes place as to the poor in the
   lanes, and afterwards among the higher orders in the wide streets. The
   whole verse might be thus rendered, -- 1. Go ye round through the
   narrow streets of Jerusalem, And see, I pray, and know; Yea, seek in
   the broad streets; If ye can find a man, if there be any, Who doeth
   justice, who seeks faithfulness, Then will I spare it. The v after
   'mmay be often rendered "Then;" and this passage requires it to be so
   rendered. "That I may pardon her" is Blayney's version; but this hardly
   corresponds with the former part; "If," and "that," form no connection.
   -- Ed

   Jeremiah 5:2

   2. And though they say, The Lord liveth; surely they swear falsely.

   2. Etsi, vivit Jehova, dixerint, ob id in vanum (vel, fallaciter)
   jurabunt.


   This is added by way of anticipation; for the Jews, as it is well
   known, thought that they had a cover for all their vices, inasmuch as
   they had God's name continually in their mouths. Since then they
   professed to worship the God of Abraham, they thought that this pretext
   was sufficient to cover all their wickedness. The Prophet obviates this
   objection, and shews that this disguise was of no avail, because in
   thus using God's name, they profaned it: and he goes still further; for
   he shews that the Jews, not only in common practice, were wholly
   destitute of the fear of God, but that when anything of a religious
   kind appeared among them, it was sacrilegious; and this is far worse
   than when God's name is forgotten, and wretched men allow themselves a
   full license in sinning, as though they could not conceal their
   wickedness: for when they openly provoke God, and as it were dishonor
   him to his face, how detestable and how monstrous is their impiety!
   This then is what Jeremiah sets forth, Though they say, Live does
   Jehovah, yet in this they swear falsely

   We now perceive the Prophet's meaning: In the first place, he takes
   away from hypocrites their vain confidence in thinking that God would
   be propitious to them, provided they avowed his name, without
   considering how precious God's name is, but regarding it as nothing to
   swear carelessly by his name: but the Prophet not only condemns the
   hypocrisy of the Jews, but, as I have said, he enhances their
   wickedness; for they hesitated not to profane God's sacred name, and to
   carry on, as it were, an open war with him, by abusing his name in
   swearing.

   By mentioning, Live does Jehovah, he refers to the words which the
   godly also use when they make an oath; for when they appeal to the
   living God, it is the same thing as though they stood before his
   tribunal; and at the same time said, that they knew that though God may
   defer his vengeance, yet an account must be given, because he ever
   lives. Thus the godly acknowledge that there is nothing gained by
   delay, in case God suspends his vengeance, if they swear falsely. But
   the Prophet, as I have already said, applies this to hypocrites, who
   seemed to ascribe great honor to God, for nothing is more specious than
   their words: gall indeed was in their heart, while honey was on their
   lips. Hence the Prophet derides this false pretense, and says, "Even
   when they swear most solemnly as to the words used, and shew a high
   concern for religion, nevertheless they swear falsely." Some render
   lkn, lacen, surely, or certainly; but the meaning will be plainer, if
   we render it "nevertheless." [129] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [129] There are many MSS. which have 'kn, "surely, "but lknmay also be
   so rendered; yet, as "nevertheless" is its meaning, in Jeremiah 16:14,
   and other places, it may be so taken here. The Septuagint must have
   read l' kn, and the sentence is a question, "Do they not thus swear
   falsely?" But the early versions favor the present reading; and it
   gives a suitable meaning, -- And though "Live does Jehovah, "they say,
   Nevertheless falsely do they swear. The verbs are in the future tense,
   but used to express present acts, as is the case often in Hebrew, and
   also very commonly in Welsh. The words in the latter language might be
   expressed exactly as in the former, and be understood as speaking of
   what is present, -- Ac er "Byw yw Jehova" a ddywedant,
   Etto yn gelwyddog y tyngant. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:3

   3. O Lord, are not thine eyes upon the truth? thou hast stricken them,
   but they have not grieved; thou hast consumed them, but they have
   refused to receive correction: they have made their faces harder than a
   rock; they have refused to return.

   3. Jehova, oculi tui annon ad veritatem? Percussisti eos, et non
   doluerunt; consumpsisti eos, et renuerunt suscipere disciplinam (vel,
   correctionem;) obduraverunt facies suas magis quam petram (vel,
   lapidem, magis quam saxum;) renuerunt converti (vel, redire.)


   Some give a strained exposition of the beginning of the verse, or
   rather pervert it, as though the Prophet had said, that God would not
   turn his eyes from what was right, because he would rigidly execute his
   vengeance on his people. But Jeremiah goes on here with the same
   subject, for there is no importance to be attached to the division of
   the verses. They who have divided them have often unknowingly perverted
   the meaning. The divisions then are not to be heeded, only the number
   is to be retained as a help to the memory; but as to the context, they
   often are a hindrance to readers; for it is preposterous to blend
   things which are separate, and to divide what is connected. This remark
   has just now occurred to me, and it is necessary, as this place calls
   for it; for the Prophet, after having said that the Jews were
   perfidious and guilty of duplicity, and destitute of all integrity,
   immediately adds, But the eyes of God regard fidelity; as though he had
   said, that they in vain pretended to avow God's name, and made a shew
   of religion by ceremonies and by an outward display; for God searches
   the heart, and cares nothing for those external masks by which men's
   eyes are captivated.

   The Prophet very significantly turns his discourse to God, to shew that
   he was wearied in addressing the people, for he saw that he prevailed
   nothing with the obstinate; for had there been any teachable spirit in
   the Jews, he would no doubt have exhorted them to practice integrity.
   He might have said, "They are mistaken who swear falsely in God's name,
   and persuade themselves that he will be their Father; for his eyes
   regard fidelity and uprightness of heart." This would have been a
   regular way of proceeding, and this mode of teaching would have been
   most suitable: but Jeremiah abruptly breaks off his address, and leaves
   his own people; "O God, "he says, "thy eyes look on fidelity;" as
   though he had said, "What more can I have to do with this wretched
   people? I address words to rocks and stones: therefore I bid you adieu,
   and shall have no more to do with you; I will now turn to God." We now
   see how much more forcible and striking is this turning from the people
   to God, than if the Prophet continued his address to the Jews, and
   sought to instruct them: for he now shews that he was broken down with
   weariness; for he saw that his labor was useless, and that all whom he
   had addressed were altogether refractory: nor did he, at the same time,
   intend to speak these words at random, and to no purpose; nay, his
   object was more sharply to touch those who were stupid, by letting them
   know that he left off addressing them, because he had no hope
   respecting them.

   But what I have said elsewhere ought to be borne in mind, -- that the
   Prophets did not write all that they preached, but collected the
   substance of what they had delivered to the people; and this collection
   now forms the prophetic books. There is therefore no doubt but that
   Jeremiah had spoken at large on repentance, -- that he had exposed the
   sins of hypocrites, -- that he had denuded the fallacious pretences of
   the people, -- and that he had severely reproved their obstinacy. But
   after having done all these things, he found it necessary to desist
   from pursuing his course, for he saw that no fruit could be hoped from
   his labors and his preaching. Now, when the Jews knew this, they ought
   to have been deeply affected; and this ought to be the case with us
   now, when we see that God's Spirit is provoked by our perverseness; and
   as this is a dreadful thing, it is what ought more than anything else
   to touch our hearts. Consider what it is: God daily invites us most
   kindly to himself; but when he sees that our hearts and heads are so
   extremely hard, he leaves us, because we grieve his Spirit, as it is
   said by Isaiah. (Isaiah 63:10.) It was not, then, an usual or common
   mode of teaching which the Prophet adopted; but it was calculated to
   have more effect than plain instruction; for he shews that the
   wickedness of the people could no longer be endured.

   Jehovah, he says, thine eyes, are they not on the truth? In this
   address to God there is an implied contrast between God and men. The
   most wicked, we know, flatter themselves while they can retain the good
   opinion and applause of the world; and as long as they continue in
   honor, they slumber in their vices. This foolish confidence is what the
   Prophet evidently exposes; for he intimates that the eyes of God are
   different from those of mortals: men can see a very little way, hardly
   three fingers before them; but God penetrates into the inmost and the
   most hidden recesses of the heart: and the Prophet speaks thus of God's
   eyes, in order to shew how worthless are the opinions of men, who
   regard only a splendid outward appearance. By truth, the Prophet means,
   as in the first verse, integrity of heart. Hence without reason do they
   philosophize here, who seek to prove from this passage that we are made
   acceptable to God by faith only; for the Prophet does not speak of the
   faith by which we embrace free reconciliation with God, and become
   members of Christ. The meaning indeed is in no way obscure, which is
   this -- that God cares not for that external splendor by which men are
   captivated, according to what is said in 1 Samuel 16:7,

   "Man sees what appears outwardly; but God looks on the heart."

   There the Holy Spirit expresses the same thing by "heart" as he does
   here by fidelity or "truth." For Samuel shews that David's father was
   mistaken, because he brought forward his sons who excelled in their
   outward appearance: "Man sees, "he says, "what appears outwardly; but
   God looks on the heart."

   We now understand the true meaning of the Prophet, -- that though
   hypocrites flatter themselves, and the whole world encourage them by
   their adulations, all this will not avail them; for they must at last
   come before the tribunal of God, and that before God truth only will be
   approved and honored.

   He afterwards adds, Thou hast smitten them, and they have not grieved
   The Prophet reproves here the hardness of the people; for they had been
   smitten, but they repented not. Experience, as they say, is the teacher
   of fools; and it is an old proverb, that fools, when corrected, become
   wise. Both poets and historians have uttered such sayings. Since, then,
   the Jews had such a perverse disposition, that even scourges did not
   lead them to repentance, it was an evidence of extreme wickedness. And
   thus the Prophet here confirms what he had said before, that God would
   be merciful to them, if one just man could be found in the city: he
   confirms that declaration when he says, "Thou hast smitten them, but
   they have not grieved." The Jews, no doubt, groaned under their
   scourges; yea, they howled and poured forth grievous complaints: for we
   know how petulantly they spoke evil of God. They then had grieved; but
   grief here is to be taken in a special sense, according to what Paul
   says of repentance, that its beginning is grief or sorrow. (2
   Corinthians 7:9, 10.) In this sense it is that the Prophet says here,
   that they who had disturbed minds grieved not, for they did not feel
   that they had to do with God. He then means by this word what another
   Prophet means, when he says, that they did not regard the hand of him
   who smote them. (Isaiah 9:13.) For he does not say that they were so
   senseless as not to feel the strokes; but that the hand of God was not
   seen by them; and yet this is the principal thing in our sorrow. For if
   we blindly and violently cry out in our troubles, and cry, Wo, a
   hundred times, what is it all? our lamentations are only those of brute
   animals: but when we regard the hand of him who smites us, our grief
   then is of the right kind. Jeremiah says, that the Jews did not grieve
   in this manner, for they did not perceive that they were justly
   chastened by God's hand.

   He afterwards enlarges on the subject, Thou hast consumed them he says,
   and they refused to receive correction By saying that they had been
   consumed, he proves them guilty of extreme perverseness; for when God
   lightly chides us, it is no great wonder if, through our tardiness and
   sloth, we are not immediately roused; but when God doubles his strokes,
   yea, when he not only smites us with his rods, but draws his sword to
   consume us entirely; yea, when he thus deals with us, and executes his
   vengeance by terrible judgments, if then we are still torpid in our
   sins, and feel not how dreadful it is to endure his judgments, must we
   not be indeed wholly blinded by the devil? This is then the stupor
   which the Prophet now deplores in the Jews; for not only were they
   without a right feeling of grief when God smote them, but when they
   were even consumed, they did not receive or admit correction. And in
   this second clause he shews what we have already said, -- that the
   grief he speaks of is not to be taken for any sort of grief, but of
   that which regards God's judgment, and proves that we fear him.

   He adds, They have hardened their faces as a rock, and lastly, they
   have refused to return The Prophet means, that the Jews were not only
   refractory, but that they were also without any shame. If, indeed, they
   had given every evidence of being ashamed, it would have been still
   useless, except there was, as we have said, an integrity of heart. But
   it often happens, that even the worst, though inwardly full of impiety
   and of contempt towards God, and of perverseness, do yet retain some
   measure of shame. In order to shew that the Jews had arrived to extreme
   impiety, the Prophet says, that they had hardened their faces, that is,
   that they were wholly without shame; for they had cast away everything
   like reason, and made no difference between right and wrong, between
   honesty and baseness. As, then, they had put off every human feeling,
   he says that nothing remained to be done, but that God, as he had
   previously declared, should execute on them extreme vengeance. And he
   repeats what he had said, -- that they refused to turn He means, that
   they sinned and went astray, not through mistake or want of knowledge,
   but that they disregarded their own safety through willful and
   deliberate wickedness, and that they knowingly and avowedly rejected
   God, so that they would not endure either his teaching or his
   corrections. [130]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [130] The literal rendering of this verse is as follows, -- Jehovah!
   thine eyes, are they not on faithfulness? Smitten them hast thou, but
   they have not grieved; Thou hast consumed them, -- they have refused to
   receive correction; Harder have they made their faces than a rock; They
   have refused to return. The "truth" here, and in the first verse, is
   regarded by Calvin and most commentators, as faithfulness towards men.
   But a right view of the context will shew that it refers to fidelity
   towards God. Of what does the preceding verse speak? Of unfaithfulness
   towards God -- swearing falsely in his name; that is, making a false
   and hypocritical profession of him; and in this verse they are
   described as refusing to return to him. In the fifth and sixth verses
   they are represented as having "broken the yoke," and as having
   apostatized from him; and in the seventh their going after other gods
   is expressly mentioned. The word "judgment" has been taken in the same
   way, but not, in my view, agreeably to the context. To do judgment, is
   to do what is just and right; and "the way of Jehovah," and "the
   judgment of God," in the next verse, are the same, and hence put in
   apposition; the word "nor," in our version, being improperly
   introduced. The way of the Lord is the way he has prescribed in his
   word; and it is called his judgment, because it is what he has
   determined and ordained, or what is just and right. God had not only
   revealed his law, but had also appointed and ordained it for the people
   of Israel. His law is called a way, because it points out the course
   which we are to take; and it is his judgment, because it is what God
   has determined, fixed, and appointed. Hence in the fifth verse they are
   said to have broken the yoke and burst the bonds. The yoke was the law,
   and the bonds were those of loyalty and obedience; or they were the
   bonds of justice, such as were justly ordained and imposed on them. --
   Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as the devil ceases not to soothe us by his
   allurements, so that we may become torpid and stupefied, -- O grant,
   that thy word may so shine in our minds and hearts that we may not grow
   torpid in darkness; and do thou also so rouse us by thy Spirit, that we
   may attend to those warnings of thy prophets, by which thou wouldest
   bring us to the right way, that we may not perish; and may we so
   assiduously exercise repentance through the whole course of our life,
   that we may ever be displeased with ourselves on account of our sins;
   and may we judge ourselves daily, that we may turn away from us thy
   wrath, until having at length finished our warfare, which we have to
   carry on continually with our sins, we shall come to that blessed rest
   which has been procured for us in heaven, by Jesus Christ our Lord. --
   Amen.

   Jeremiah 5:4-5

   4. Therefore I said, Surely these are poor; they are foolish: for they
   know not the way of the Lord, nor the judgment of their God.

   4. Et ego dixi, Certe (alii vertunt, forsan, 'k) pauperes sunt hi,
   stulte egerunt, quia non cognoscunt viam Jehovae, judicium Dei sui:

   5. I will get me unto the great men, and will speak unto them; for they
   have known the way of the Lord, and the judgment of their God: but
   these have altogether broken the yoke, and burst the bonds.

   5. Ibo ad optimates (ad magnos, ad verbum) et loquar apud eos; quia
   ipsi cognoscunt viam Jehovae judicium Dei sui: atque ipsi fregerunt
   jugum, ruperunt vincula.


   Some think that the Prophet here makes an excuse for the people, and,
   as far as he could, extenuates their fault; but they are greatly
   mistaken. For there is no doubt but that he, by this comparison, more
   clearly shews how past remedy was then the state of things. The sum,
   then, of what he says is, -- that corruptions so prevailed, not only
   among the multitude, but also among the chief men, that there remained
   no soundness, as they say, from the head to the sole of the foot.
   Nearly the same thing, only in other words, is stated by Isaiah in the
   twenty-eighth chapter; for after having spoken generally against the
   people, he assails the leading men, and says that they were inebriated
   no less than the common people, that they were inebriated with wine and
   strong drink. But the meaning is, that they were like drunken men,
   because they felt no shame, while they abandoned themselves to deeds
   the most disgraceful.

   To the same purpose is what Jeremiah says here, when he declares, that
   he thought that they were the poor who had thus sinned, and obscure men
   and of no repute; but that he had found the same thing among the chief
   men as among the common people. He might, indeed, have only said, "Not
   only the lowest orders, the multitude, are become corrupt, but also the
   chief men, who ought to have excelled the rest." But much more striking
   is the comparison, when he says, "It may be, that these miserable men
   have thus sinned because they understood not the law of God, nor is it
   a matter of wonder; but greater integrity will be found in the chief
   men." By speaking thus the Prophet brings the reader into the midst of
   the scene, and shews to him that not only all the people were guilty,
   but also the priests and the prophets, and the chief men in the state.
   The design of the Prophet is thus evident.

   I said, he says, not that he thought so; for he saw that all things
   were in such a disorder, that nothing better could be hoped from the
   chief men than from the common people. This was clearly seen by the
   Prophet: but, as I have said, he wished to shew here, by a striking
   representation, how wretched was the condition of the whole people. He
   says, Surely The particle 'k, ak, is an affirmative, or, as in the next
   verse, an adversative. Some, indeed, take it here in the sense of 'vly,
   auli, perhaps, or, it may be; and regard it as signifying a concession,
   "Let us grant this," he says; "they are the poor, they are of no
   account, they are as it were the offscourings, who have thus sinned: it
   is nothing strange, if they conduct themselves thus foolishly, for they
   know not the way of Jehovah, nor the judgment of their God " [131]

   The law was, indeed, given to all without any difference; so that the
   common people had no excuse. But this evil has prevailed almost in all
   ages, -- that few attend to the teaching of the law; for there is no
   one who is not inclined to shake off this yoke. The common people,
   indeed, think that they have some excuse for neglecting it, because
   they have no leisure, and are not born for high stations. The Prophet
   then speaks according to this prevailing opinion; but he does not
   extenuate their fault who pleaded ignorance as an excuse, because they
   had not been taught in schools; for, as it has been said, God intended
   his law for the whole people without exception.

   By the way of Jehovah and the judgment of God, the Prophet means the
   same thing: such a repetition is very common in Hebrew. God, in
   prescribing to us the rule of life, shews to us the way in which we are
   to walk: our life, indeed, is like to a course; and it is not God's
   will that we should run at random, but he sets before us the goal to
   which we are to proceed, and also directs us in the only way that leads
   to it. For it is the office of the law to call us back from our
   wandering, and to lead us to the mark set before us. Hence the law is
   called the way of Jehovah; and judgment, mspht, meshephet, as it was
   said yesterday, means rectitude, or a rule of life. What he calls in
   the first clause the law of Jehovah, he calls in the second the
   judgment of God And thus he shews that they were inexcusable, who made
   the objection that they were miserably ignorant, and knew nothing; for
   it was God's purpose to shew to them, no less than to the most learned,
   how they were to live.

   He now adds, I will go to the great By the great he meant the priests
   and the prophets, as well as the king's counselors, and the king
   himself. I will go, [132] then, he says, to the great, and will speak
   to them It is the same as though he had said, that everywhere his labor
   was in vain, for not only he spoke to the deaf when addressing the
   illiterate vulgar, but also when addressing the chief men. I have said,
   that the Prophet did not make the inquiry as one doubtful, but his
   purpose was to make the chief men ashamed of themselves, and also to
   confirm what he had said before, -- that not one just and upright man
   could be found in Jerusalem.

   For they know, he says, etc. He declares the same thing in the same
   words. But we must ever remember, that the Prophet did not believe
   this; but he speaks of it as a thing that appeared probable: for who
   could have then thought that there was so much ignorance in the chief
   men? for they were in great esteem among the people. Since then the
   opinion prevailed, that all those who were rulers were well acquainted
   with the law, Jeremiah speaks according to what was commonly thought,
   and says, that they knew the way of Jehovah

   He afterwards adds, But (for 'k, ak, is to be taken here adversatively,
   and its proper meaning is, nay or but) they have alike broken the yoke,
   they have burst the bonds; that is, "If any one thinks that the rulers
   are better than the common people, he is much deceived; for I have
   proofs enough to shew that their conduct is the same; they have broken
   the yoke of God no less than the most ignorant." By this repetition he
   more fully confirmed their defection, and at the same time reminded
   them how shameful it was, that prophets, priests, and rulers, who
   occupied the first places in the state, had become so unbridled in
   their vices. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [131] It is better to take 'khere and in the next verse as an
   affirmative, Truly, surely, doubtless. Blayney, as well as Calvin,
   render nv'lv, "have acted foolishly." The verb occurs in three other
   places, Numbers 12:11; Isaiah 19:13; Jeremiah 50:36. To be, or to
   become, foolish, or rather stupid, sottish, or stupidly ignorant, seems
   to be its meaning. It is here opposed to knowledge; and evidently
   refers to the state of the mind, and not to the conduct. Their
   sottishness was their idolatry. This is the special sin referred to
   throughout the passage, -- Then I said, Doubtless, the poor are these,
   they have become stupid, For they have not known the way of Jehovah,
   The judgment of their God. -- Ed.

   [132] Literally it is, "I will go for myself," -- an idiomatic form of
   speech. The Welsh is exactly the same, af rhagof; which means, I will
   go forth; but it cannot be literally expressed in another language.
   After the verb, as in Hebrew, there is a preposition prefixed to "me."
   -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:6

   6. Wherefore a lion out of the forest shall slay them, and a wolf of
   the evenings shall spoil them, a leopard shall watch over their cities:
   every one that goeth out thence shall be torn in pieces: because their
   transgressions are many, and their backslidings are increased.

   6. Propterea percussit eos leo e sylva; lupus solitudinum (alii per
   rvvt intelligunt vesperas, quia deducunt ab rv quod significat
   vesperum; ita vertunt, lupus vesperinus) vastavit eos; pardus (alii
   vertunt, pantheram) vigilans super urbes eorum; quisquis egredietur,
   discerpet (vel, lacerabit;) quoniam multiplices sunt iniquitates eorum,
   auctae sunt defectiones ceorum.


   Here, at length, God shews that he was moderate in his judgments, so
   that the wicked in vain charged him, as it is usual with them, with too
   much rigor.

   Some render the words in the past tense, and think the sense to be,
   that the Prophet reminds the Jews that they had not been afflicted
   without reason by so many evils, as they had deserved heavier
   punishments. But another view may be taken; for we know that in Hebrew
   the tenses often change; and I am inclined to regard the future tense
   as intended; for the Prophet seems not here to record what they had
   already suffered, but to remind them of the heavy punishment that was
   awaiting them. Smite them shall the lion from the forest

   The wolf is called the wolf of solitudes, because of his coming forth
   from the desert. Some render the words, "the wolf of the evening;" and
   this may be allowed. We indeed know, that in other places hungry wolves
   are called the wolves of the evening; for after having sought their
   prey in the day -- time, and finding none, they become in the evening
   almost mad, and their hunger causes them to run furiously in all
   directions. This explanation, then, may be admitted. But as he says
   first, that the lion would come from the forest, it is more probable
   that the wolf is described as coming from the desert. [133] As to the
   general import of the passage there is not much difference.

   He mentions here three wild beasts -- the lion, the wolf, and the
   leopard. By these wild beasts he understands no doubt the enemies, who
   would shortly attack them with the greatest cruelty. It is indeed true
   that the Jews, before the time in which Jeremiah spoke to them, had
   been afflicted with many evils; for God had not punished them only
   once, but had given them frequent warnings; and had there been any hope
   of repentance, they might have still continued in safety, though
   considerably reduced. But Jeremiah seems to predict future punishment:
   he therefore refers, not only to the Egyptians and the Assyrians, but
   also to other enemies. For that people, we know, were hated by all
   their neighbors, and had suffered grievous wrongs even from their own
   kindred. Since, then, many nations were hostile to the Jews, it is
   nothing strange that the Prophet enumerates here three sorts of wild
   beasts; as though he had said, that enemies would come from every
   quarter, who would, like lions, wolves, and leopards, vent their fury
   on them, because they had so often, and for so long a time, provoked
   God's wrath. At the same time, God does here check those false
   complaints which are wont to be often alleged by the wicked, and shews
   that he is a righteous Judge, and that the punishments he inflicted
   could not be blamed by the Jews: and it was for this purpose that he
   used the particle, Wherefore -- l-kz, ol-kan.

   He also adds, A leopard shall watch, that he may tear all who shall go
   out of the cities This language is no doubt metaphorical; and what he
   means is, that when the enemies would occupy the land, the Jews would
   be shut up in their cities, and would not venture to go forth, for
   dangers would await them everywhere.

   At the end of the verse he repeats again, and speaks more fully of what
   he meant by "Wherefore -- l-kz, "at the beginning of the verse; [134]
   for he says, Because multiplied have their transgressions, and
   increased have their defections By these words he further proves what
   he had said, that God is a righteous judge, even when he seems to be
   too severe: for it could not have been otherwise, but that he must have
   visited with extreme vengeance a people so abandoned and irreclaimable.
   Nor does he only call them wicked, and apostates, but he says that
   their iniquities, [135] or evil deeds, were many, and that their
   defections had increased And by the last expression he amplifies their
   guilt: for though phs, pesho, does not mean simply to offend, but to
   act wickedly; yet to fall away from God is a baser and a more atrocious
   sin. We hence learn, that such was the wickedness of the Jews, that it
   could not be corrected by common means or moderate punishment. He
   afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [133] The word, as found here, is never used for the evening; it ever
   means the desert, or uncultivated plains. The plural termination of the
   word, when it means the evening, is -ym, and not -vt, as here. See
   Numbers 22:1; Joshua 5:10; Jeremiah 39:5. In these verses it is
   rendered "plains;" they were evidently uncultivated, and might properly
   be called deserts. The Vulgate and the Targum have led commentators
   astray as to this word. The Septuagint have completely misunderstood
   it, and have rendered the sentence, "The wolf even to the houses (heos
   ton oikion) has destroyed them." The version of Blayney is, "The wolf
   of the plains:" and he says in a note, that they were "unenclosed
   commons." used for sheepwalks, which were commonly "infested with
   wolves." -- Ed

   [134] This illative, "wherefore," or therefore, or, for this cause, is
   both retrospective and anticipative. It is a reason given for what is
   contained in the latter part of the last verse, and for what is
   contained in the last words of this verse; it anticipates the particle
   "because" before "multiplied." -- Ed.

   [135] It is rendered "asebeias -- impieties, "by the Septuagint;
   "prevarications" by the Vulgate; "rebellions" by the Targum. It does
   not mean "iniquities," but willful violations of the law in matters
   connected with God's worship and service. The other word means
   apostasies, defections from God, rendered by the Septuagint,
   "apostrophais -- turnings away, "and so by the Vulgate and the Targum.
   They were defections to various forms of idolatry. Their idols
   increased in number. The Septuagint render the last sentence thus,
   "They have become strong (ischusas) in their turnings away." The
   Vulgate and the Targum are the same. The Verb tsmmeans an increase in
   quality or in quantity. But both verbs may be rendered here as
   transitives, -- Because they have multiplied their transgressions,
   They have strengthened (or increased) their apostasies. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:7

   7. How shall I pardon thee for this? thy children have forsaken me, and
   sworn by them that are no gods: when I had fed them to the full, they
   then committed adultery, and assembled themselves by troops in the
   harlots' houses.

   7. Quomodo super hoc parcam tibi (hoc est, parcerem, nam debet resolvi
   futurum tempus in modum potentialem, quomodo, inquit, parcerem tibi
   super hoc?) Filii tui dereliquerunt me, et jurarunt in non Deo: ego
   autem saturavi eos, et scortati sunt (tamen scortati sunt;) et domus
   meretricis congregaverunt se (vel, in domum meretricis, ita subaudienda
   erit litera v servilis.)


   There is here what rhetoricians call a conference: for God seems here
   to seek the judgment of the adverse party, with whom he contends, on
   the cause between them, though it was sufficiently clear; and this is a
   proof of confidence. When advocates wish to shew that there is nothing
   doubtful or obscure, they thus deliberate with the opposite party, --
   "Why, I will propose the matter privately to yourself; have you
   anything to say? Even if you were at liberty to determine the question,
   would not reason compel you to pronounce such a judgment as this?" So
   now God shews that he was constrained, as it were, by necessity to
   inflict on the Jews a most severe punishment, and intimates that he was
   not, as it were, at liberty to do otherwise. "If I am, "he says, "the
   judge of the world, is it possible that they can escape unpunished, who
   thus openly provoke me? Should I not expose to ridicule my glory? and
   should I not also divest myself of my own power? I should cease to be
   what I am, and in a manner deny myself, were I not to punish a people
   so wicked and irreclaimable." We now perceive the Prophet's meaning.

   Some consider v, vau, to be understood, and take 'y, ai, for 'yn, ain,
   and read thus, "I will not spare thee for this." But as there is no
   reason to make any change, and many agree in the view that has been
   given, I prefer to follow what has been most commonly received. The
   meaning of 'y, ai, in Hebrew is "where;" but it also means "how: "and
   here it is to be understood, not of place, but of manner, "How could I
   for this be propitious to you?"

   We see how God, as it were, deliberates with the opposite party, and
   even appeals to them for judgment, "Say now, were I to allow you so
   much liberty and power as to decide the question, could I, who am the
   judge of the world, spare you who are guilty of such vices?"

   Thy sons have forsaken me This was the first sin: and when God
   complained that he was forsaken, he intimated that the people had
   willfully, and from deliberate wickedness, cast off the yoke; for the
   same thing could not have been said of heathens. It is indeed true, if
   we have regard to the beginning, that all may be charged with
   defection, for God had revealed himself to the sons of Adam and of
   Noah; and when they fell away into superstitions, they became
   apostates. But the defection of the Jewish people was much more recent,
   and less to be borne: nay, when they boasted that they were God's
   people, who could have alleged the pretense of ignorance? We now then
   see what the Prophet means when he says, that God had been forsaken by
   the people.

   He then adds, They have sworn by a no- god He means, by stating a part
   for the whole, that the worship of God was become corrupt and vitiated:
   for swearing, as it was stated yesterday, is a part of God's worship.
   Whenever we swear by God's name, we profess that we are under his
   power, and that we cannot escape if we swear falsely: we also ascribe
   to him his glory as the God of truth; and we further testify that
   nothing escapes him, or is hid from his view. Hence, by saying here
   that the Israelites swore by a no- god, he means that God was deprived
   of his own right. They were indeed guilty of other sins; but, as it has
   been stated, the Prophet includes under one kind all the superstitions
   which then prevailed among the people. It was then the same as though
   he had said, that they worshipped idols and gods, whom they had devised
   for themselves.

   He adds a circumstance which enhanced their guilt, I have filled them,
   he says, and they have committed adultery There is here a striking
   alliteration, which must not be omitted, he had said, ysvn, ishbon,
   "they have sworn;" and now he says, 'sv, ashbo, "I have filled them."
   The only difference is in a point; when placed on the left side of s,
   shin, the word means to fill, and when on the right, to swear. [136]
   The Prophet then says, that they had sworn to another God, and yet had
   been filled God shews here how base and disgraceful had been the
   ingratitude of the people; for they had been filled to the full with
   all blessings, and yet they did not acknowledge their own God, who had
   been to them a Father, so kind and bountiful: I have filled them, he
   says, and they have committed adultery

   Now this passage teaches us, that they who go astray, when allured by
   God's paternal kindness and bounty, are on that account the more
   unworthy of pardon. When men grow wanton against God, while he is
   kindly indulging them, they no doubt treasure up for themselves wrath
   against the day of wrath, as Paul tells us in Romans 2:5. Let us then
   take heed, lest we indulge ourselves, while God is, as it were,
   indulging us; and lest prosperity should lead us to wantonness: but let
   us learn to submit ourselves willingly to him, even because he thus
   kindly and sweetly invites us to himself; and when he shews himself so
   loving, let us learn to love him.

   He says, that they committed adultery This may be taken metaphorically:
   but as in the next verse he inveighs against their vagrant lusts and
   adulteries, this phrase may be taken in its literal sense. I yet think
   that adultery here is to be understood figuratively, as meaning that
   they had no spiritual chastity, inasmuch as they did not give God his
   own glory. He further says, And at the house of the harlot have they
   assembled together The word "house" may be taken in the nominative
   case, as the Jews might have been called the house of the harlot; as
   though the Prophet had said, that all Jerusalem and Judea were like
   brothels. But some consider v, beth, to be understood, so that they
   assembled themselves, as it were, at the house of a harlot; and that he
   thus alludes to the temple. And it is a mark of great shamelessness,
   when many adulterers or wanton men assemble in one house; for most are
   ashamed of their adulteries, so that they endeavor to hide their
   baseness: but when they come together in troops, as though under an
   uplifted banner, it is a proof that there is no shame, but that they
   thus disregard all decency, like brute beasts. The most suitable
   meaning then is, that they are said to have assembled together in
   brothels, because they gloried in their own superstitions and
   sacrileges. [137] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [136] This has been done by the Punctuists, and is no part of the
   language. -- Ed.

   [137] The last line may be rendered thus, -- And the house of the
   harlot they crowd. The verb for "crowd" seems here to be transitive,
   though it be intransitive in Micah 5:1. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 5:8

   8. They were as fed horses in the morning: every one neighed after his
   neighbour's wife.

   8. Equi saginati (alii vertunt, armati, intelligunt phaleratos) mane
   surgentes (alii vertunt, trahentes, deducunt a ksm, sed rectius alii
   deducunt a mks, et nomen esse existimant;) quisque ad uxorem proximi
   sui hinnit (est quidem futurum tempus, sed significat continuum actum.)


   Jeremiah comes now, I think, to the second table, and mentions one kind
   of evil; but his object was to shew that there was no chastity, no
   faithfulness, no honesty in that people. He therefore compares them to
   wanton and lustful horses, and thus exposes their infamous conduct. Had
   he said that every one did lie in wait for the bed of his neighbor, it
   would have been a heinous crime; but when he calls their lust neighing,
   and calls them horses, and those well fed, and who rise early after
   they are filled, he doubtless shews that such was their incontinence,
   that they were not only wanton and adulterous, but that they were worse
   and more base, for they differed nothing from lustful horses, and
   horses well fed. Some read the last word "armed, "deducing it from
   yvnizan, which means to be armed; and others derive it from zvn, zun,
   which signifies to eat, and hence they take mvzn, muzan, for food.
   There is indeed no doubt but that it means here "fed, "or fat; for why
   should he call them armed horses? What some say, that they rose early
   after having committed adultery, in order to exhibit their disgrace,
   and to boast of their vices, is too far-fetched. What is meant is, that
   they were strong horses, and active, and that they rose up early after
   having been well fed. [138]

   We now then understand the Prophet's object: the sum of the whole is,
   -- that there was no chastity among the Jews, for they gave themselves
   up to wanton lusts, not only like adulterers and whoremongers, but like
   lascivious horses. Nevertheless, as we have said, he includes here,
   under incontinency, thefts, frauds, rapines, and all vices of this
   kind; for he no doubt charges the Jews as guilty of transgressing
   against the second table of the law. He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [138] The literal rendering of this verse, and countenanced by ancient
   versions, is as follows, -- Horses well fed! libidinous have they
   become; They neigh, every one at the wife of his neighbor. Both Venema
   and Blayney agree in giving this meaning. It does not seem, when the
   whole context is viewed, that adultery here is to be taken in its
   literal sense. It is spiritual adultery, that is, idolatry, that is
   referred to throughout the chapter. Besides, the comparison in this
   verse is such, that its application is more suitable to idolatrous acts
   than to those which are adulterous. The same may be said of what is
   found in the preceding verse, -- that they crowded the house of the
   harlot. This is not so much the case in adultery as in idolatry, when
   people fill their idolatrous temples. A simile is sometimes carried
   beyond what is actually the case, in order to convey a right idea of
   what it is intended to illustrate. When they are said to be like
   well-fed stallions, and neighing at the wives of their neighbors, the
   purpose was to shew with what intense ardor they were devoted to
   idolatry: and the degrading comparison was no doubt made in order to
   pour contempt on their mad propensity: it was like the impetuous
   instinct of an animal, uncontrolled by any reason, persuasion, or
   remonstrance. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:9

   9. Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: and shall not my
   soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

   9. An non super his (vel, super hoc) visitabo (vel, non visitarem,)
   dicit Jehova? et an in gente quae talis est (quae secundum hanc) non se
   ulciscetur anima mea?


   God again holds, as it were, a conference with them, and for this
   purpose, -- that he might check all their complaints and close their
   mouths, lest they should object and say, that they were too severely
   treated. That this objection then might be removed, God repeats that he
   could not pardon such atrocious sins. And this principle is adopted,
   that it was impossible not to punish such wicked men who would not
   repent. For since God is the Judge of the world, he can no more
   surrender his judgment than his essence. As, then, the majesty of God
   and his office of a Judge are inseparably connected, the Prophet
   concludes, that what the Jews thought was impossible, that is, that
   they could escape unpunished, and yet continue to provoke God, as it
   were, by open war, with their dreadful sins: Should I not then visit
   for this, saith Jehovah?

   Here is introduced the name of Jehovah. An earthly judge may pardon the
   ungodly and the worst of men; but this cannot be done by God; for
   whenever God pardons, he leads sinners to repentance: so that he never
   suffers sins to be unpunished. For he who repents becomes his own
   judge, and thus anticipates God's judgment. Where then there is true
   conversion, God shews no indulgence to sins. But when persistency in
   sins is such, that they who are warned despise all instruction, it is
   impossible that God should forgive; as in that case he would renounce
   his own glory, which can never be. Should I not then visit for this,
   saith Jehovah?

   And on such a nation as this should not vengeance my soul take? God
   speaks here after the manner of men, for he seeks no vengeance; and
   when he speaks of his soul, even this is not strictly suitable to him;
   but there is here nothing obscure; for what is meant is, that he is at
   enmity with wickedness, as it is said in Psalm 5:5, that he cannot bear
   iniquity. Since it is so, it follows that he must either be thrust from
   his celestial throne, or punishment must be inflicted on the wicked,
   who remain perverse and set no end nor bounds to their sins. Whenever
   then delusion creeps over us and Satan seeks by his allurements to lead
   us to forget God's judgment, let this come to our minds -- that God
   would not be God, except he were to punish sins. It is then necessary
   that he should punish sins or be displeased with us: but, as it has
   been said, he cannot be inconsistent with himself or dissimilar in his
   nature, since no change can take place in him. Either then his hand is
   stretched out to punish our sins, or his judgment must be anticipated
   by us. And how can this be done? By learning to bring sentence against
   ourselves, by becoming displeased with our sins.

   When therefore our conversion will be of this kind, then God will be
   merciful to us; and thus he will not pardon our sins, as though he
   approved of them, or as though he did not exercise his office as a
   judge. But as I have said, what is here taught is rightly addressed to
   those who are either refractory, or whom Satan renders so stupid and
   forgetful, that they call not themselves to an account; in short, what
   is here said will render the ungodly, who go on in their perverseness,
   inexcusable, or it will awake those who are healable, that they may
   judge themselves, and not wait until God stretches forth his hand to
   execute extreme punishment.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are at this day inclined to those
   vices, to which we learn thine ancient people were too much given, -- O
   grant, that we, being governed by thy Spirit, may not harden ourselves
   against those thy holy warnings, by which thou daily reprovest us and
   our sins, but that we may be teachable and obedient: and as we have
   hitherto too much resisted thee and carried on war with thy justice,
   may we learn to fight with ourselves and with our sins, and rely on thy
   word, until we gain the victory, and at length attain that triumph,
   which has been prepared for us in heaven by Jesus Christ our Lord. --
   Amen.

   Jeremiah 5:10

   10. Go ye up upon her walls, and destroy; but make not a full end: take
   away her battlements; for they are not the LORD'S.

   10. Ascendite muros ejus et diruite (vel, dissipate;) et consumptionem
   ne feceritis (vel potius, finem;) auferte propagines ejus (vel, ramos,
   vel, dentes murorum, ut alii vertunt, vel, pinnas,) quia non sunt
   Jehovae.


   Here God by the mouth of his Prophet addresses the enemies of his
   people, whom he had appointed to be the ministers of his vengeance: and
   this was usual with the prophets, when they sought more effectually to
   rouse and more sharply to touch the hearts of men; for we know how
   great is their indifference when God summons them to judgment. As then
   Jeremiah saw that simple instruction availed but little, he used this
   mode of speaking. He then in the person of God addresses the Chaldeans,
   and bids them to come to attack Jerusalem. The prophets often speak
   thus, -- "Hiss will God for the Egyptians," or, "Sound shall the
   trumpet, and he will send for the Chaldeans." (Isaiah 5:26; Isaiah
   7:18.) But the representation is more effectual to penetrate into the
   hearts of men, when the Prophet at God's command assembles enemies as a
   celestial herald and bids them what to do, even to destroy the whole
   city.

   He says first, Ascend ye her walls By which words he intimates, that
   the Jews in vain boasted of the height of their walls, for God would
   make their enemies to ascend them, so that the entrance would not be
   difficult. They hoped indeed that they were safe, because the city was
   well fortified. Hence he says, that they were deceived; and he exposes
   their folly, for their walls would not protect them.

   He afterwards adds, An end do not make This sentence is explained in
   two ways. Some take it in a good sense, as though God mitigated the
   extremity of their punishment, according to the meaning which some
   attach to the words in the last chapter; for though God in that passage
   terrified the Jews, yet they consider that by way of mitigation this
   was added, "I will not yet make a consummation," that is, there will be
   some remaining. And the prophets are wont thus to speak, when they
   intend to shew that some seed will ever remain, so that the Church
   shall not wholly be destroyed. Thus also do the same interpreters
   explain this passage, as though God had said, that the ruin of
   Jerusalem would be such that the Church would still continue, for there
   would be no consummation. But others take klh, cale, as signifying an
   end: and this meaning is more suitable; for God in this verse severely
   threatens the Jews with destruction. It is no objection, that it is
   said elsewhere, that the consummation would not be complete; for it is
   quite evident that the prophets do not always adopt the same mode in
   speaking: when they denounce vengeance on the reprobate, they leave no
   hope; and so this mode of speaking often occurs, "I will make an end:"
   but when they address the faithful, they moderate the severity of their
   threatenings by saying, "God will not make a consummation." I am
   therefore disposed to take their view, whom regard consummation here as
   signifying an end; and kll, calal, means to finish. The meaning then
   is, "Demolish the city, and let there be no end," that is, destroy it
   entirely. [139]

   To the same purpose is what immediately follows, Take away her shoots,
   or her branches, or the teeth of her walls, as some render the word. I
   think, however, that the Prophet refers to the width of the walls in
   their foundations; for we know that walls are so built, that the
   foundation is wider than the upper structure. The word which the
   Prophet uses, means shoots, which spread far and wide. They who render
   it, the wings of the walls, seem not to me to understand what the
   Prophet means; for he speaks not here of the top of the walls, but of
   the foundations, as though he had said, "Overthrow or demolish from the
   foundation the walls of the city: "and why? They are not Jehovah's, he
   adds. The Jews were inflated with this empty confidence, -- that they
   were safe under the protection of God; for they imagined that God was
   the guardian of the city, because the sanctuary and the altar were
   there. Hence the Prophet declares, that the walls or the foundations
   were not God's. [140] Nor could it have been objected, that it is said
   elsewhere, that the city had been founded by the Lord: God had indeed
   chosen his habitation and his throne there; but on this condition --
   that the people should faithfully worship him. When Jerusalem was made
   a den of thieves, God departed thence, according to what is said by
   Ezekiel in chapter 14 (Ezekiel 14). Here then the Prophet reproves that
   foolish confidence, by which the Jews deceived themselves, when they
   thought that God was in a manner bound never to forsake the defense of
   the city. He denies that their walls and foundations were God's; for
   the Jews by their sins had so polluted the whole place, that God could
   not dwell in such filth. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [139] See [4]Note on Jeremiah 4:27.

   [140] It is true the word means shoots or branches; but as the root
   means to spread, it evidently signifies here battlements, bulwarks, or
   ramparts. It is rendered "huposterigmata -- props, pillars," by the
   Septuagint; "propagines -- shoots," by the Vulgate; "foundations," by
   the Syriac and Arabic; and "palaces, or towers," by the Targum. Our
   version has the most suitable word -- "battlements." Blayney has
   "branches," and thinks that the cities of Judea are meant; but this is
   not suitable to the context. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:11

   11. For the house of Israel and the house of Judah have dealt very
   treacherously against me, saith the Lord.

   11. Quoniam transgrediendo transgressi sunt in me domus Israel et domus
   Jehudah, dick Jehova.


   The verb vgd, begad, means to deceive, to act perfidiously. God then
   charges the Jews here with perfidy, because they had revolted from him:
   for he does not only complain that they had in some measure sinned
   against him, and that he was therefore offended with them, but he
   charges them with general defection. Hence he says, that both the
   Israelites and the Jews had become perfidious and apostates. The
   people, we knew, were now divided into two kingdoms: and though
   Jeremiah had been given especially as a teacher to the tribe of Judah,
   it was yet his duty to labor also for the Israelites. The kingdom of
   Israel was now in some measure fallen, for four tribes had been driven
   into exile, and the kingdom was dismembered and feeble. He yet wished
   to do all the good he could to the remnant. Hence he says here, that
   they were wicked apostates, for they had acted perfidiously towards
   God. [141] And as this charge was heinous, and might have deeply
   wounded their minds, he ascribes to God what the Jews would have hardly
   endured as coming from him; and says, thus saith Jehovah, as though he
   had said, "There is no reason for you to contend with me, as though I
   had dealt severely with you: contend with God himself, since he it is
   who declares that you are all perfidious." He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [141] The verb vgd, when followed by vas here, means to deal
   deceitfully, perfidiously, or treacherously, with one. See Exodus 21:8;
   Judges 9:23; Lamentations 1:2. It may be rendered here to dissemble, --
   For they dissembling have dissembled with me, The house of Israel and
   the house of Judah, saith Jehovah. As the verb is repeated, if we
   render it "to act perfidiously," instead of repeating the words, to
   give them their force and meaning, we must say, For they have dealt
   most perfidiously with me. To "deal unfaithfully," as rendered by
   Blayney, is too feeble an expression. To "prevaricate" is the word used
   by the Vulgate, and the same by the Septuagint and the Targum. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 5:12

   12. They have belied the Lord, and said, It is not he; neither shall
   evil come upon us; neither shall we see sword nor famine:

   12. Negarunt Jehovam (alii vertunt, mentiti sunt Jehovae,) et dixerunt,
   Non est, et non veniet super nos malum; et gladium et famem non
   videbimus.


   He expresses more clearly and fully what he had previously said. Their
   perfidy was, that they had denied God I do not wholly reject what
   others have said, that they lied to God: but as v is here used after
   kchs, I cannot see that it means to lie. It ought to have been in that
   case, kchsv, lyhvhcacheshu La-Jeve: but as it is vyhvh, Be-Jeve, I
   doubt not but that he simply declares that they denied God; and the
   context seems to require this meaning; for he immediately adds, that
   they said there was no God [142] This certainly was not to lie to God,
   but to reject him as one who did not exist. As then the sense would be
   less significant, were we to say, that they lied to God, I am inclined
   to take the other meaning, that they denied God; that is, that they
   wholly disregarded him or sought to erase the remembrance of him.

   The reason which follow requires special notice: They have said, He is
   not To render this more clear, he says, that they boasted of impunity.
   It seemed, no doubt, to exceed credibility, when the Prophet said that
   God was denied by the Jews; but that they might not evade the charge,
   he continued it, they have said, He is not We are further to consider
   why he brought against them so grievous and so atrocious a charge: it
   was, because they boasted that they should be free from the punishments
   which the prophets had threatened.

   We then see what Jeremiah alleges against them, even their contempt and
   also their perverseness. They felt themselves safe notwithstanding the
   prophetic threatenings. The Prophet says, this is nothing less than
   wholly to deny God. Were we judges, this declaration might appear too
   severe: but let us pause, and acquiesce in what the Holy Spirit has
   pronounced.

   And this is a remarkable passage, whence we may learn how abhorred by
   God is their indifference, who harden themselves against his
   threatenings, and wholly disregard his judgment. For if we acknowledge
   him as God, his power as a judge ought not to be taken away. What does
   God's name mean? Doubtless they who imagine that God remains quiet in
   heaven and enjoys his leisure and his rest, though they may not in
   words deny God, yet treat him with mockery: there is in them at the
   same time no religion and no thought of a divine being. Let us then
   carefully notice this passage, in which the Prophet testifies that God
   is denied by us, except we be moved by his threatenings; for the
   torpidity in which we indulge ourselves, when God denounces his
   judgment on us, is the same as the denial of him; nor is there anything
   by which they can extenuate their sin who thus despise the vengeance of
   God. For the Holy Spirit has once for all declared, that all who trifle
   with the prophets do in their hearts say, that there is no God,
   inasmuch as they deprive him of his power and of his office, and leave
   him only a naked essence; nay, they make him only a creature of the
   imagination or a mere phantom.

   We now then understand the meaning of the Prophet: he more fully
   explains the perfidy with which he had charged the Jews; for he says
   that they denied God, and said, He is not; and they proved that they
   did all this, for they did not believe the evil to be at hand which the
   prophets had announced. It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [142] According to all the instances in which the verb occurs, followed
   by v, its meaning is what Calvin states, though not so rendered
   uniformly in our version. The verb, followed by v, occurs elsewhere
   five times, -- Leviticus, 6:2, 3; Joshua 24:27; Job 8:18; Isaiah 59:13;
   Hosea 9:2. In Leviticus 6:3, vkchs vh, ought to be rendered, "and
   denieth it;" and so the verb ought to be, rendered in the previous
   verse, "and deny to his neighbor his deposit," etc. It is rendered here
   "lied to the Lord" by the Septuagint and the Targum; and "denied the
   Lord" by the Vulgate and the Syriac, and so also by Piscator, Venema,
   and Blayney. The denial seems to have been as to the Lord speaking in
   his prophets. Calvin appears to have gone too far in saying that they
   denied his existence. The expression which follows, "Not he," means
   that he was not in the prophets. The import is correctly given in our
   version, "It is not he," that is, who speaks in the prophets. The verse
   might be literally given thus, -- 12. And they deny Jehovah, And say,
   "It is not he, And come upon us shall not evil, And the sword and the
   famine we shall not see." Then the following verse, which is a
   continuation of what they said, proves clearly what the meaning of this
   is, -- 13. "And the prophets shall be wind, For the word is not in
   them: Thus shall it happen to them," or, Thus shall it be done to them.
   That is, they shall be found out to be like the wind, having spoken
   nothing real, such as shall be accomplished. Indeed the last line may
   be translated thus, -- Thus shall he do to (or, deal with) them. The
   reference in this case is to God, who, they thought, would render
   abortive, or turn as it were into wind, what the prophets had
   threatened. Their blindness and presumption appear to us to have been
   extreme. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:13

   13. And the prophets shall become wind, and the word is not in them:
   thus shall it be done unto them.

   13. Et Prophetae erunt in ventum, et sermo non est in eis; sic fiet
   illis.


   The Prophet goes on with the same subject; and this passage is worthy
   of especial notice, as it commends to us in no common way the public
   preaching of the truth. For what can be imagined more abominable than
   to deny God? yet if his word is not allowed to have authority, it is
   the same as though its despisers attempted to thrust God from heaven,
   or denied his existence. We hence see how the majesty of God is, as it
   were, indissolubly connected with the public preaching of his truth.
   The design of this verse is the same, in which Jeremiah refers to the
   contempt manifested by the people.

   He introduces the Jews as saying, The prophets shall become wind, there
   is not in them the word, and the evil with which they have threatened
   us, shall come upon their own heads It may have been, that the Jews did
   not openly give vent to such a blasphemous language; but so gross was
   the contempt they shewed towards the prophets, that this impiety was
   sufficiently conspicuous in their whole life. It was not then without
   reason that the Prophet charged them with so base an impiety, that they
   said, that the prophets would become wind. The same is the case now;
   the greater part, when God thunders and gives proofs of his vengeance
   by his servants, ridicule everything, and heedlessly cast away every
   fear, -- "Oh, they are mere words; for the preachers fulminate boldly
   and terribly in the pulpit; but the whole vanishes, and whatever they
   denounce on us will fall on their own heads." We see at this day that
   many ungodly and profane men use such a bantering language as this.
   Though it might not have been, as I have said, that the Jews dared thus
   openly to shew their contempt towards God; yet the Holy Spirit, who
   extends his authority over the hearts, minds, and feelings of men,
   justly charged them with this gross impiety. It may also be learnt from
   other places, that they made such advances in audacity, that they
   hesitated not to treat with scoffs the threatenings announced by the
   prophets. However this may have been, the Prophet sets forth by a
   striking representation how great was the contemptuous perverseness of
   the people towards God: for there is here a vivid description, by which
   he sets as it were before our eyes how impious the Jews had become;
   inasmuch as they dared openly to assault the prophets and willfully to
   charge them with declaring what was vain, The prophets, they said,
   shall become wind; and farther, There is not in them the word

   By these words the Jews denied that the prophets were to be believed,
   however they might pretend God's name, for they boasted falsely that
   this or that was committed to them from above. Thus it was, as we see,
   that every instruction was trodden under foot, and the same we find to
   be the case in the present day; for what reverence is manifested
   anywhere for God's word? This passage then ought to be especially
   noticed by us; for it shews as in a mirror to what extent of audacity
   and madness men will break forth when they begin to discredit God's
   word.

   They afterwards add, Thus shall it be done to them; or, "May it be thus
   done to them;" for some regard the words as an imprecation, as though
   the wicked had said, "Let the prophets find to their own destruction
   what the sword, the famine, and the pestilence are; as they cease not
   continually to stun our ears with these terrible things, may they
   themselves experience these scourges of God." But we may retain the
   form of the verb, Thus shall it be done to them; [143] as though they
   set themselves in opposition to God's servants, and pretended that they
   were God's prophets, "Oh! we have a prophecy too: they terrify us by
   announcing the sword, the famine, and the pestilence; we can in our
   turn retaliate on them, and declare that the pestilence, the war, and
   the famine are nigh them; for what authority have they thus to assail
   us? Have we not authority to do the same to them?" We now then perceive
   what is meant in this last clause. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [143] This sentence is left out in the Septuagint, the Syriac, and the
   Arabic, but retained by the Vulgate, -- "Haec ergo evenient illis --
   These things shall therefore come to them." This meaning the original
   will hardly bear. The reference seems to be to the Prophets becoming
   wind, being so proved by the event. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 5:14

   14. Wherefore thus saith the Lord God of hosts, Because ye speak this
   word, behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, and this people
   wood, and it shall devour them.

   14. Ergo sic dicit Jehova, Deus exercituum, Quia protulistis verbum
   hoc: Ecce ego dabo verba mea. (vel, ponam verba mea) in ore tuo quasi
   ignem (vel, in ignem,) et populus hic, lignum, et vorabit eos.


   God shews here how intolerable to him was their wantonness in despising
   the prophets, through whom he would have himself attended to. Though
   Christ did not refer to this passage, when he said,

   "He who hears you hears me,
   and he who despises you despises me,"
   (Luke 10:16)

   yet it contains an eternal law; for God's will from the beginning has
   been, that his servants should be obeyed, as though he himself had come
   down from heaven. Hence the Jews dealt no less contumeliously with God
   in despising his prophets, than if they had dared to treat God himself
   with contempt. God then now shews how much he abhorred that madness,
   through which they rendered void all the labors of his servants.

   Therefore thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts Jeremiah made this
   preface, that he might more effectually rouse the Jews; for if he had
   omitted Thus saith Jehovah, and had begun thus, "Because ye have
   announced this word, behold, as fire shall be the word of God, "his
   doctrine would have been objected to, and treated with contempt. But
   now, by alleging the name of God, and that not simply, but by adorning
   it with a high attribute, and calling him "the God of hosts, "he makes
   known his power in order to strike them with fear. He then says, "Thus
   saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, Because ye have spoken this word,
   "etc. Here he changes the persons often; and it behooved him to do so,
   that there might be more force and point in what he said. He ought to
   have said in the third person, "Because they have spoken thus, Behold,
   I will make my words in thy mouth, "etc.: but he now addresses the
   people, and then he turns to his servant Jeremiah. He therefore says,
   "Ye have indeed spoken thus;" that is, "Ye have scoffingly spoken, as
   though my prophets had nothing but the empty sound of words;" Behold,
   he says, I will make my words in thy mouth like fire, (he thus
   addresses the Prophet,) and this people shall be wood, and the fire
   shall devour them

   God compares his own word to fire, not as in other places, nor for the
   same reason; but this similitude has a particular meaning, -- that the
   prophetic word would consume the people as fire consumes dry wood or
   straw. In other places the word of God is called fire, because it
   kindles the hearts of men, because it cleanses or burns the filth
   within. But he treats not here of the benefit or the fruit which the
   faithful derive from God's word: but God declares only that the
   doctrine of the Prophet would prove fatal to the people; and hence he
   expressly says, "I make my words in thy mouth like fire." Had he said,
   "Behold, my words shall be like fire, and this people shall be stubble,
   "it would not have been sufficiently expressive. But as the people had
   been accustomed to scoff and say, "Ah! what are these prophets, and
   what are their words? they beat the air only;" as then the Jews had
   been wont to speak in this manner, he now replies to them, and says, "I
   will make my words in thy mouth like fire;" that is, Thy tongue alone
   shall be more than sufficient to destroy the whole people. Jeremiah
   teaches here the same thing with Paul, when he said,

   "We have vengeance in readiness against all altitude which rises
   against the gospel."
   (2 Corinthians 10:4, 5)

   For it has ever been an evil, common to all ages, either to neglect, or
   wholly to despise the servants of God. When Paul saw that the gospel
   was despised by many, he said that he and other ministers had vengeance
   in readiness; as though he had said, "As many words as we speak shall
   be so many swords to slay all the ungodly; and though their hardness
   now reject the judgment of God, their perverseness shall avail them
   nothing. Let them now then know that there is so much power in my word,
   as though God were openly to put forth his hand from heaven, as though
   he were to dart forth his lightnings." The same thing is what Jeremiah
   means here, Behold, he says, I will make my words in thy mouth fire;
   that is, there will be so much power in thy words, that the ungodly
   shall know to their own loss that thou art the executioner of my
   vengeance.

   This passage ought to be carefully observed by us, lest by our
   ingratitude we shall so provoke God's wrath against us, as that his
   word, which is destined for our food, shall be turned to be a fire to
   us. For why has God appointed the ministers of his gospel, except to
   invite us to become partakers of his salvation, and thus sweetly to
   restore and refresh our souls? And thus the word of God is to us like
   water to revive our hearts: it is also a fire, but for our good, a
   cleansing, and not a consuming fire: but if we obstinately reject this
   fire, it will surely turn to answer another end, even to devour us, and
   wholly to consume us.

   But he says that this people would be wood: as the ungodly set up an
   iron front against God, they think they can thus drive to a distance
   his vengeance; the Prophet now laughs to scorn this madness, and says
   that they would be like wood or straw. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 5:15

   15. Lo, I will bring a nation upon you from far, O house of Israel,
   saith the Lord: it is a mighty nation, it is an ancient nation, a
   nation whose language thou knowest not, neither understandest what they
   say.

   15. Ecce ego adduco super vos gentem e longinquo, domus Israel, dicit
   Jehova; gentem duram (hoc est, quae dura erit, quia sequitur 'vh,)
   gentem quae est e seculo, gentem cujus non tenebis (vel, cognosces)
   linguam (nam relativum est v) et non audies quid loquatur.


   The Prophet shews here how the people would become like straw or dry
   wood; for God would bring a sure calamity which they did not fear. But
   the context is to be here observed: the Prophet had said, that the word
   in his mouth would be like fire; he now transfers this to the Assyrians
   and Chaldeans. Now these things have the appearance of being
   inconsistent; but we have already shewn that all the scourges of God
   depended on the power of his word: when, therefore, the city was cut
   off by the Assyrians and Chaldeans, then the fire from the mouth of
   Jeremiah broke forth to destroy the city and the people.

   In short, Jeremiah intimates, that when the enemies came, no account
   was to be made of their strength nor of their forces, and that they
   would not bring with them any aids for the war, but that there would be
   the execution of what he had said, of what had proceeded from his
   mouth; for we shall elsewhere see that he was sent by God to besiege
   the city; but with what forces? He was alone and unarmed; this is true;
   but this siege was not understood by the wicked and reprobate, yet it
   was not without its effect; for as the Prophet spoke, so God executed
   what had proceeded from his mouth. We hence see that the Chaldeans
   proceeded as it were from the mouth of the Prophet, like willing
   enemies, who throw darts to demolish the walls of a city, who east
   stones and upset the walls by warlike engines, or like those who at
   this day use other warlike machines, by which they demolish cities.
   What then are all these instruments of war? They are the fire which God
   casts forth by the mouth of his servants; and the truth which had been
   declared by them, has accompanying it all those engines of war which
   can destroy not only one city and one people, but the whole world, when
   it shall so please him.

   I bring then upon you a nation from far We have said elsewhere why the
   Prophet refers to long distance, even because the Jews thought that
   there was no danger nigh them from nations so remote, as though we were
   to speak of the Turks at this day, "Oh! they have to fight with other
   nations: let those who are near them contend with the Turks, for we may
   live three or four ages in quietness." We see such indifference
   prevailing in the present day. Hence the Prophet, in order to deprive
   the Jews of this vain confidence, says that this nation was near at
   hand, though coming from remote quarters.

   He says that they were a hard, or a strong nation, and a nation from
   antiquity He means not simply that it was brave through age, but that
   it was hard and ferocious; for he says afterwards that they were all
   gvrym, geberim, that is, valiant. He then calls it a hard nation,
   because it was cruel, and he afterwards mentions the barbarity of that
   nation. But he says first that it was from antiquity: for it generates
   spirits more ferocious, when a nation has ruled for a long time, and
   from a period out of memory: this very antiquity is wont to inflate the
   minds of men with pride, and to render them more ferocious. He says
   then, that it was from antiquity

   He afterwards speaks of its barbarity: Thou wilt not, he says,
   understand its language, nor wilt thou hear what it speaks [144] By
   language, we know, not only words, but also feelings are communicated.
   Language is the expression of the mind, as it is commonly said, and it
   is therefore the bond of society. Had there been no language, in what
   would men differ from brute beasts? One would barbarously treat
   another; there would indeed be no humanity among them. As then language
   conciliates men one towards another, the Prophet, in order to terrify
   the Jews, says that that nation would be barbarous, for there would be
   no communication made with it by means of a language. Hence it followed
   that there would be no pity to spare the conquered, no, not if they
   implored a hundred times; nor could they be heard, who were miserable,
   and such as might obtain some favor, if they were understood.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [144] The verb smhere is not merely to hear, but to hear effectually,
   that is, so as to understand. It has this meaning in other places; see
   Deuteronomy 38:49; 2 Kings 18:26. The whole verse may be thus rendered,
   -- 15. Behold, I am bringing upon you a nation from far, O house of
   Israel, saith Jehovah, -- A nation, strong it is, A nation, from
   antiquity it is, A nation, thou wilt not know its language, Nor
   understand what it speaks. The third, fourth, and fifth lines, as well
   as the first of the next verse, are left out in the Septuagint, but
   retained by the Vulgate, Syriac, and the Targum. The two first render
   the word for "strong," "robustam," and the last by "fortis -- brave."
   Blayney renders it "strong," which is no doubt its meaning. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that though thou mightest justly condemn us at
   this day for the gross and wicked impiety, which thou didst formerly
   condemn by the mouth of thy Prophet in thine ancient people, -- O
   grant, that we may not proceed in our obstinacy, but learn with pliable
   minds, and in true docility of heart, to submit to thy word, so that it
   may not turn to our ruin, but that we may by experience find it to be
   appointed for our salvation, so that being inflamed with a desire for
   true religion, and also cleansed from the filth of depraved affections
   and of carnal lusts, we may devote ourselves wholly to thy service,
   until having put off the flesh and all its filth, we shall at length
   attain to that perfect purity, which is set before us in thy gospel,
   and be made partakers of thy eternal glory in Christ Jesus our Lord. --
   Amen.

   Jeremiah 5:16

   16. Their quiver is as an open sepulchre, they are all mighty men.

   16. Pharetra ejus tanquam sepulchrum apertum; omnes fortes.


   The Prophet had already threatened the Jews with the vengeance of God,
   and had said that the ministers and executioners of it would be the
   Chaldeans: he now continues the same subject, and says that their
   quiver would be like an open sepulcher The nations of the East, we
   know, made much use of arrows and darts, for they had no pitched
   battles; but they pretended a flight, and then suddenly turning, they
   hurled their darts and arrows against their enemies. The Prophet then
   had a regard to this mode of fighting, when he says that their quivers
   would be like open sepulchres. It may seem at first sight an unnatural
   comparison; but it is the same as though he had said, that they would
   be so skillful in throwing arrows as to destroy all who met them. [145]

   And he adds, that they would be all strong, that the people might know
   that it would not be a slight conflict: in short, it is the same as
   though he had said, that this war would be a certain ruin to the Jews,
   in which they should all perish. He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [145] The idea intended is capaciousness. The grave is represented as
   never satisfied, ready to receive any number. See Proverbs 27:20;
   30:16; Habakkuk 2:5. The Chaldean quiver would be so large as to
   contain a vast quantity of arrows, as though it was an open grave. --
   Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:17

   17. And they shall eat up thine harvest, and thy bread, which thy sons
   and thy daughters should eat: they shall eat up thy flocks and thine
   herds: they shall eat up thy vines and thy fig trees: they shall
   impoverish thy fenced cities, wherein thou trustedst, with the sword.

   17. Et vorabit messem tuam et panem tuum; vorabunt filios tuos et
   filias tuas; vorabunt greges tuos et armenta tua; vorabunt vitem tuam
   et ficum tuam; ad inopiam redigent urbes munitionum tuarum, in quibus
   tu confidis, per gladium.


   He continues to speak in a similar way of the cruelty of their enemies;
   as though he said that victory was already in their hand, for they were
   the scourges of God. He does not then set before the Jews the troubles
   of war, but speaks of them as conquered; and he only shews that the
   Chaldeans would be cruel in the use they would make of their victory.
   He takes it as granted that the Chaldeans would be conquerors, for they
   would come armed from above: and he makes this addition, -- that they
   would act cruelly and in an unusual manner towards the vanquished Jews.

   Hence he says, They will eat (it will eat, for he changes the number,
   though the sense remains the same [146] ) thine harvest and thy bread;
   that is, all that thou gatherest shall become a prey to thine enemies;
   for by harvest and bread he means every kind of provision. Then he
   adds, thy sons and thy daughters, which was still worse; it is indeed
   hard to be deprived of food, but it is still more dreadful for parents
   to see their children slain before them. The Prophet however says, that
   such would be the barbarity of their enemies, that they would not spare
   even boys and girls. He further mentions herds and flocks; and then he
   adds the vine and the fig-tree; as though he said, nothing would be
   safe among the Jews, for their enemies would plunder everything, and
   that being not content with meat and drink, they would kill their very
   infants. And further, as the Jews had fortified cities, and were on
   that account insolent towards the prophets, their vain pride is here
   brought down; for he says, that their fortified cities would be reduced
   to poverty; and he adds, in which thou trustest All these, he says,
   shall fall by the sword; for this last word, vchrv, becherab, applies
   to the whole verse, and to each part of it; as though he had said, "By
   the right of the sword shall the conquerors lay waste thy whole
   country, even all thy possessions; yea, and they shall slay thy sons
   and thy daughters." It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [146] According to the Hebrew, the verbs, except the second, are all in
   the singular number. The Septuagint have pluralized them, but the
   singular is retained by the Vulgate, the Targum, and the Syriac. It is
   the "nation" described in the 15th verse. The second verb may be
   rendered in a passive sense, and the meaning will be more appropriate,
   -- And it will devour thy harvest and thy food, Devoured shall be thy
   sons and thy daughters; It will devour thy sheep and thy ox, It will
   devour thy wine and thy fig-tree; It will wholly desolate thy fortified
   cities, In which thou trustest, by the sword. The language used here,
   and in the 15th verse, is remarkably like that of Moses in Deuteronomy
   28:48-52. The second line may be deemed parenthetic. It is better to
   preserve the poetic singular in sheep, ox, vine, and fig-tree. As it is
   a reduplicate verb, entire desolation is intended, and that by the
   "sword" in destroying all the occupants of fortified cities. Venema,
   and others, as well as Calvin, connect the "sword" with all the
   preceding clauses; but this is not necessary, nor is it indeed
   suitable. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:18

   18. Nevertheless in those days, saith the Lord, I will not make a full
   end with you.

   18. Atque etiam in diebus illis dicit Jehova, non faciam vobiscum finem
   (alii vertunt, consumptionem.)


   Different views may be taken as to the meaning of this verse; but the
   greater part of interpreters think that a hope is here given to the
   faithful; yea, nearly all are of this opinion; indeed I know not any
   one who takes another view. They then think that God moderates here
   what he had previously said, and that he gives some ground of hope to
   his servants, lest they should imagine that the Church would be so
   reduced as to have no seed remaining: and klh, cale, as it was said
   yesterday, is often taken in this sense. But when I now carefully
   consider the context, I feel constrained to take another view, even
   this -- that God here enhances the severity of his vengeance. And the
   particle gm, gam, "also, "or even, favors this view; as though he had
   said, "Think not that it will be all over when your enemies shall thus
   plunder you of all your possessions, deprive you of your children, and
   reduce you to extreme want; for ye shall not by any means be thus freed
   from all evils, as I shall pursue my vengeance still further." There
   will hereafter follow promises to moderate threatenings, that the
   hearts of the faithful may not despond: but in this place the Prophet,
   I have no doubt, introduces God as a Judge, executing vengeance, as
   though there was no place for mercy.

   Then also, he says; for the particle gm, gam, is inhansive and
   emphatic; Then also, in those days; that is, "When your enemies shall
   strip your land of its produce, and of all its animals, and of its
   inhabitants, I shall not even then cease to pursue you: I will not make
   an end with you, for there will still remain scourges, when ye shall
   think that rest is given to you, and that the end of evils and of all
   calamities had come." In this manner is God wont to deal with the
   impenitent; for such is their perverseness, that being smitten they
   become more and more hardened, and champ the bit, according to the old
   proverb. And hence is their hardness, because they think that God is,
   as it were, disarmed when he has punished them for their sins. He
   therefore declares that he has in his power different kinds of
   punishment and different ways of punishing. [147] And to the same
   purpose is what follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [147] See [5]note on Jeremiah 4:27. Even if the design pleaded for by
   Calvin be admitted, there is no necessity to give the expression a
   meaning different from what it has in other places, -- Yet even in
   those days, saith Jehovah,
   I will not make with you a completion, that is, I will not wholly
   destroy you. It depends on the context what the bearing of this may be,
   while the sentence itself retains the same meaning. "I will not wholly
   destroy you, for I intend to preserve a Church for myself," he might
   also say, "I will not wholly destroy you, for I have other punishments
   in reserve for you:" and the latter, as Calvin maintains, seems to be
   the purport of the expression in this passage. Still the words
   themselves have the same meaning. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:19

   19. And it shall come to pass, when ye shall say, Wherefore doeth the
   Lord our God all these things unto us? then shalt thou answer them,
   Like as ye have forsaken me, and served strange gods in your land, so
   shall ye serve strangers in a land that is not yours.

   19. Et erit quum dixeritis, Quare fecit Jehova Deus noster nobis omnia
   haec? Tunc dices illis, Sicuti dereliquistis me et serviistis diis
   alienorum (alieni, ad verbum, sed est enallage numeri) in terra vestra;
   sic servietis alienis (subaudiunt alii interpretes deos, sed pervertunt
   sensum Prophetae) in terra non vobis (hoc est, in terra quae non erit
   vestra.)


   It hence appears that what I have said is true, -- that the Prophet did
   not soften what was severe in the threatenings which we have noticed,
   but that he treated the Jews according to their perverseness; for he
   saw that they were untamable; and the Spirit had taught him that such
   would be their obstinacy, that until they were wholly broken down, they
   would not bend their necks to receive the yoke. He further assigns the
   cause here, that they might not contend with God, as hypocrites are
   wont to do, whenever God sharply chastises them; for they murmur
   against him, and complain and demand reasons why he treats them so
   severely, as though they were wholly innocent. As, then, hypocrites
   made such complaints, the Prophet here replies to them.

   It shall be, he says, when ye shall say: he addresses the Jews in the
   person of God. He then immediately turns God's address to himself, Why
   has Jehovah our God done to us all these things? He ascribes here to
   hypocrites what is ever in their mouths whenever they are summoned to
   judgment; for they are so well prepared to contend, as though their
   cause was the best that could be; and, could God be constrained to
   render an account, they would prove him guilty of cruelty and of
   immoderate rigor. We hence see how graphically the Prophet describes
   refractory men, who will not yield nor acknowledge their fault, but
   with an iron front rise up against God: and the same thing we find in
   other passages in the prophets, especially in the first chapter of
   Malachi; for there the Prophet often repeats the words of the people,
   "In what? In what? What means this?" So also here Jeremiah says, When
   ye shall say, Why has Jehovah done all these things to us? as though
   they were innocent: for the reprobate, as though they had washed away
   all their sins by having wiped their mouths, boldly come forth and
   demand a reason why God chastises them. So also in this place they
   hesitate not to call God their God, as though they had not denied God,
   according to what we have seen yesterday. For so gross an impiety
   prevailed among them, that they imagined that all things were ruled by
   chance, and that God unjustly punished them. Though then they had
   perfidiously forsaken God, yet the Prophet here, in order to expose
   their petulancy, introduces them here as saying that they regarded God
   as connected with them.

   Then, he says, thou shalt say God one while addresses the people, and
   at another time the Prophet. When, therefore, they shall begin thus to
   murmur, then thou mayest reply, Because ye have forsaken me That what
   was said might have more weight, God would have the Prophet to speak in
   his name, "because ye have forsaken me, "as though Jeremiah did not
   himself say the words, but God by his mouth; and have served the gods
   of the alien, that is, of aliens, in your land God shews here briefly
   what the Jews deserved; and he thought it sufficient to mention one
   kind of sin only. We shall see elsewhere, as we have often seen, that
   they were in other respects wicked and guilty before God. But the
   Prophet observes brevity here, and charges them only with one sort of
   sin. Ye shall serve tyrants, he says, in a strange land, who shall
   cruelly oppress you, because ye have served their gods in your own land

   God reproves them here for having abused his kindness; for he had
   expelled the heathen nations from Canaan, and gave that land, which was
   so pleasant and fruitful, as an inheritance to them, so as to be to
   them a perpetual rest. God called the land his own rest, because he
   protected the Jews there, and appointed them as the legitimate heirs of
   the land even to the end of the world. Hence he says now, your land The
   reminding them of this kindness was doubtless intended to amplify their
   guilt; for they possessed the land by the best title, though they had
   not acquired it themselves.

   In your land, he says, ye worshipped gods; he does not say, "strange
   gods, "but "the gods of the stranger, "or of strangers. The prophets
   often speak thus; they call them the gods of the strangers, or of
   strange people: but the expression is emphatical; for it was very base
   and less excusable for the Jews, while they had God dwelling among
   them, to seek gods here and there, and as it were to entreat heathens
   for gods, and say, "Give us your gods." It was then this base conduct
   that the Prophet now points out as with the finger, Because ye have
   served the gods of strangers.

   He afterwards adds, Ye shall serve strangers; he does not mean, as I
   think, strange gods; and it seems to me that those who introduce "gods"
   here, pervert the meaning. [148] He speaks of tyrants, according to
   what is said elsewhere,

   "I had given you my good laws, which if any one keeps he shall live in
   them; and ye would not obey: I will therefore give you laws which are
   not good," (Ezekiel 20:21, 25:)

   that is, "I will lay on you a tyrannical yoke, and conquerors, and
   those barbarians whose language shall be unknown to you, shall plunder
   you and your possessions, because ye have been disobedient and
   unteachable." It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [148] The last clause has been improperly omitted in the Arabic: it is
   found in the other versions. The word for "strangers" is different from
   that connected with "gods." They served "the gods of the alien," or, of
   the heathen: they would have to serve "strangers," or, foreigners, in a
   land not their own. As they had adopted the religion of heathens, they
   would have to submit to the dominion and tyranny of heathens: and as
   they did the former in their own land, they would have to do the latter
   in a foreign land. Thus their idolatry would expel them from their own
   country, and subject them to the tyranny of those from whom they
   derived their idolatry. Thus God often makes the tempters of his people
   (if they succeed) to be their tormentors. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:20-21

   20. Declare this in the house of Jacob, and publish it in Judah,
   saying,

   20. Nuntiate hoc in domo Jacob, et promulgate (ad verbum, audire
   facite) in Jehudah, dicendo,

   21. Hear now this, O foolish people, and without understanding; which
   have eyes, and see not; which have ears, and hear not:

   21. Audite agedum hoc, popule stulte et absque corde; oculi illis, et
   non vident; aures illis, et non audiunt (et non audient, ad verbum.)


   The Prophet confirms what he had said, lest the Jews should think that
   they were only terrified by words, and not dread the consequences.
   Hence he says, Declare this The Prophet, no doubt, alludes to a custom
   which prevailed; for wars were usually proclaimed by heralds. Enemies
   did not immediately march forth, but they proclaimed war that the cause
   might appear just. Hence God here declares, that he had spoken in
   earnest by the mouth of Jeremiah, as though war had been in the usual
   manner proclaimed, and armed enemies were already nigh at hand.

   Declare ye then this; and what is it? Hear, O foolish people, etc. Here
   he first reproves the Jews and Israelites for their stupidity, because
   they were even without common sense; for the heart in Hebrew means the
   mind or understanding, as we have seen elsewhere. He then says, that
   this people were destitute of all understanding. He first calls them
   fatuous or foolish; but as many are slow and heavy and yet not without
   common sense, he adds that they were a people without heart or
   understanding. He seems indeed to add by way of correction, that they
   had eyes and ears: but his object was ironically to enhance what he had
   said, and to shew that they were stupid, and no less so than blocks of
   wood or stones. How so? "Ye have ears and eyes, "he says, "but ye
   neither see nor hear." [149]

   He no doubt alludes to the idols to which they had become devoted: for
   it is said in Psalm 115:8, that those who made idols were like them, as
   well as those who trusted in them; for it had been previously said,
   that idols had ears but heard not, and eyes but saw not. Jeremiah then
   indirectly condemns the Jews here for having become so stupid in their
   superstitions as to be like dead idols: for there is in an idol some
   likeness to man; it has various members but no understanding. So also
   he says, the Jews had eyes and ears and the external form of men; but
   they were at the same time no less stupid than if they were stones or
   blocks of wood. Now follows the proclamation --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [149] It is better to retain the future tense, as their obstinacy is
   thereby more fully expressed; the whole verse may be thus literally
   rendered, -- Hear, I pray, this, Ye perverse people and without
   understanding, -- Eyes they have, but they will not see, Ears they
   have, but they will not hear. The "this" which they were to hear is
   contained in the next verse. The two last lines are only explanatory of
   the preceding. They were "without understanding," for they would not
   see, though they had eyes; and they were "perverse," or perversely
   foolish, for they would not hear, though they had ears. When two things
   are mentioned and afterwards referred to, the prophets usually explain
   the last, and then the first, as the case is here. The two last lines
   may be included in a parenthesis. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:22

   22. Fear ye not me? saith the Lord: will ye not tremble at my presence,
   which have placed the sand for the bound of the sea by a perpetual
   decree, that it cannot pass it: and though the waves thereof toss
   themselves, yet can they not prevail; though they roar, yet can they
   not pass over it?

   22. An me non timebitis, dicit Jehova? an a facie mea non
   contremiscetis? Qui posui arenam terminum mari, statutum seculi
   aeternum, et non praeteribit illud (vel, terminum illud; quidam enim ad
   proximum referunt, alii ad prius,) et movebunt se et non praevalebunt,
   et tumultuabuntur (vel, resonabunt) fluctus ejus (istud glyv extendunt
   ad duo verba,) et non transgredientur ipsum (non transilient, est idem
   verbum quod paulo ante usurpavit.)


   God shews here why he had said that the people were foolish and without
   understanding. It was indeed a monstrous stupidity, not to fear at the
   presence of God, since even inanimate elements obey his bidding: and he
   takes the sea especially as an example; for there is nothing more
   terrific than a tempestuous sea. It appears as if it would overwhelm
   the whole world, when its waves swell with so much violence. No one can
   in this case do otherwise than tremble. But the sea itself, which makes
   the stoutest to tremble, quietly obeys God; for however furious may be
   its tossings, they are yet under restraint. Now, if any inquires how
   this is, it must be confessed to be a miracle which cannot be accounted
   for; for the sea, we know, as other elements, is spherical. As the
   earth is round, so also is the element of water, as well as the air and
   fire. Since then the form of this element is spherical, we must know
   that it is not lower than the earth: but it being lighter than the
   earth shews that it stands above it. How then comes it that the sea
   does not overflow the whole earth? for it is a liquid, and cannot stand
   in one place, except retained by some secret power of God. It hence
   follows, that the sea is confined to its own place, because of God's
   appointment, according to what is said by Moses,

   "Let the dry land," said God, "appear," (Genesis 1:9:)

   for he intimates that the earth was covered with water, and no part of
   it appeared, until God formed the sea. Now the word of God, though it
   is not heard by us, nor resounds in the air, is yet heard by the sea;
   for the sea is confined within its own limits. Were the sea tranquil,
   it would still be a wonderful work of God, as he has given the earth to
   be the habitation of men: but when it is moved, as I have said, by a
   tempest, and heaven and earth seem to blend together, there is no one,
   being nigh such a sight, who does not feel dread. Hence then the power
   of God, and his dread might, appear more evident when he calms the
   turbulent sea.

   We now see the scope of the Prophet's words: He shews that the Jews
   were monsters, and unworthy not only to be counted men, but even to be
   classed with brute animals; for there was more sense and understanding
   in the tempestuous and raging sea than in men, who seemed endued with
   reason and understanding. This is the design of the comparison.

   But as it was a heavy complaint, the Prophet asks a question, Will ye
   not fear me? As though God had said, "What do you mean? How is it that
   I am not feared by you? The sea obeys me, and its fury is checked by my
   secret bidding; for I have once for all commanded the sea to remain
   within its own limits, and though it may be violently agitated by
   storms and tempests, it does not yet exceed my orders. Will not you
   men, endowed with reason, fear me? will you not tremble at my
   presence?" And he says, that he had set the sand to be the boundary of
   the sea: and this is much more expressive than if he had said that he
   had set boundaries to the sea; for the sand is movable and driven by a
   small breath of wind, and the sand is also penetrable. Were there rocks
   along all the shores of the sea, it would not be so wonderful. Had God
   then restrained the violence of the sea by firm and strong mounds, the
   keeping of it within its limits might be ascribed to nature; but what
   firmness is there in sand? for a little water thrown on it will soon
   penetrate through it. How then is it, that the sea, when tossed by
   violent storms, does not remove the sand, which is so easily shifted?
   We hence see that this word is not in vain introduced. And there is a
   similar passage in Job 38:11, where God, speaking of his infinite
   power, says among other things,

   "Hitherto shalt thou come, but no further:"

   for doubtless no storm arises, except when it pleases God. He might
   indeed keep the sea in the same quiet state; but he does not do so: on
   the contrary, he gives it as it were loose reins, but he says,
   "Hitherto shall it come." When therefore high mountains seem to
   threaten all mortals, and the earth seems nigh an overthrow, then
   suddenly the impetuous waves are repressed and become calm.

   And he adds, A perpetual ordinance It is indeed true that the sea
   sometimes overflows its limits; for many cities, we know, have been
   swallowed up by a flood; but still it is rightly said, that it is a
   perpetual ordinance or decree, that God confines the sea within its own
   limits. For whenever the sea overflows a small portion of land, we
   hence learn what it might do without that restraint, mentioned here by
   Jeremiah and in the book of Job. We hence learn, that there is nothing
   to hinder the sea from overflowing the whole earth, but the command of
   God which it obeys. In the mean time the perpetuity of which the
   Prophet speaks remains generally the same: for though many storms arise
   every year, yet the fury of the sea is still quieted, but not otherwise
   than by the command of God. True then is this -- that the sea has
   prescribed limits, over which its waves are not permitted to pass. And
   hence he says, Move themselves and not prevail shall its waves; and
   again, Resound, or tumultuate shall they, and shall not pass over [150]

   We now apprehend the design of this verse: God complains, that there
   was so much madness and stupidity in the people, that they did not obey
   him as much as the sea, even the stormy sea. He then condemns here the
   Jews, as though they were monsters; for nothing can be more contrary to
   nature than for the tempestuous sea to have more understanding than
   man, created in God's image and endued with reason. He then adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [150] The reference seems to be to the decree or ordinance, and not to
   the boundary: therefore "transgress" is the most suitable word. I would
   render the verse thus, -- 22. Should you not fear me? saith Jehovah;
   Ought you not at my presence to tremble? Who have set the sand a
   boundary to the sea. -- An ordinance perpetual, and it transgresses it
   not; Though toss themselves and prevail not, and roar do its waves, Yet
   it does not transgress it. The future tense in Hebrew may be often
   rendered subjunctively or potentially, and especially in questions. The
   non-transgressor is the sea -- the non-transgressor of the decree,
   notwithstanding the tumult of its waves. "An ordinance perpetual" is
   rendered "prostagma aio'nion -- an everlasting command," by the
   Septuagint, -- "praeceptum sempiternum -- a sempiternal precept," by
   the Vulgate and the Targum, -- and "lege perpetua -- by a perpetual
   law," by the Syriac. A perpetual ordinance is the version of Blayney.
   -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:23

   23. But this people hath a revolting and a rebellious heart; they are
   revolted and gone.

   23. Atqui populo huic fuit cor perversum et rebelle; deflexerunt et
   abierunt


   Here the previous verse is completed; for what is said here is
   connected with the question which we have noticed. But God now proves
   more clearly why he adduced what he said of the sea. The copulative v,
   vau, is to be taken here as an adversative, and to be thus rendered,
   But this people have a perverse heart: for svrr, surer, means
   "perverse;" some render it "revolting, "but improperly; for it appears
   from many other passages that it is something more: besides, the other
   meaning is more suitable to the context here; for he says first, that
   the people had a perverse heart; [151] and then, that they had a
   rebellious or an untamable heart. He no doubt compares the obstinacy
   with the obedience of the sea, or sets one in contrast with the other,
   and conveys simply this truth, that there was more fury and stupidity
   in that people than in the raging sea.

   And he proves that the people had a perverse heart by the effect; for
   they had fallen away and departed Had he said only that they had fallen
   away, the proof would not have been so complete; but by adding
   "departed, "he points out their obstinacy; as though he had said, that
   their corruption was permanent, like settled diseases, which can be
   healed by no remedies. They have then fallen away and departed; that
   is, "I could not bring them back." God had indeed often tried by his
   servants to restore them to a right course; but their perverseness only
   discovered itself more and more, and shewed itself to be irreclaimable;
   for they departed, so that there was no prospect of repentance. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [151] It is true that the idea of perverseness is conveyed by this
   word; but it means one bent on turning away from God. To turn away, or
   to apostatize, is its primary meaning, as in the latter clause of this
   verse; but here it is a participle in a reduplicate form, which has
   ever an expansive meaning. It means here either a heart continually
   turning away from God, or a heart resolutely determined to turn away
   from him. The last seems to be the meaning, as it appears to correspond
   with the next line, -- But in this people has been a heart,
   Thoroughly revolting and disobedient;
   They have revolted and gone away. When they turned away from God or
   revolted, they were remonstrated with and exhorted to return; but they
   disobeyed; hence their thorough revolt and their going away. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:24

   24. Neither say they in their heart, Let us now fear the LORD our God,
   that giveth rain, both the former and the latter, in his season: he
   reserveth unto us the appointed weeks of the harvest.

   24. Et non dixerunt in corde suo, Timeamus agedum Jehovam, Deum
   nostrum, qui dat pluviam et imbrem matutinum et serotinum (diximus de
   his verbis alibi) tempore suo; hebdomadas perpetuas messis (hoc est, ad
   messem) custodit nobis.


   The Prophet in other words proves here that the Jews had been justly
   charged with perverseness: he says, that it did not come to their
   minds, that they did not think, to fear God. We hence see that all that
   is said is designed to shew, that the people were no less senseless and
   stupid, than if they were lifeless elements; nay, that there was more
   stupidity and more furious madness in their hearts than in any created
   thing.

   To say in the heart means in Hebrew to weigh, to consider. We should
   say in Latin, "It did not come to their minds," (non venit illis in
   mentem;) that is, "Have they not been so void of common sense, that
   this thought did not come to their minds, or did not occur to them, Let
   us fear the Lord?" And here he takes away every pretense of ignorance,
   that they might not object and say, that they did not worship God
   through error or want of knowledge: "But ye had eyes," he says, and ye
   had ears, and all the faculties belonging to men; God gave you rain;
   there has been no year in which the earth did not bring forth its fruit
   for you; when ye eat bread, does not the bounty of God occur to your
   minds? and yet ye consider not that he ought to be worshipped." We
   hence see that he takes away every excuse for their ingratitude by
   saying, that they had been inattentive to those blessings, which were
   seen by the eyes, and felt by the hands, and touched by every part of
   the body. But of the rest we must speak to-morrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou daily invitest us to thyself with
   so much kindness and benevolence, and since thy word continually sounds
   in our ears, -- O grant, that we may not become deaf through the
   depravity of our flesh, but be attentive to hear the doctrine of
   salvation, and become so teachable and obedient, that we may be willing
   to be turned wherever thou pleasest, and to be guided in the way thou
   pointest out to us, until we shall at length reach that blessed rest,
   which has been prepared for us in heaven by Jesus Christ our Lord. --
   Amen.

   Lecture Twenty-Second

   Yesterday was exhibited the senselessness of those who were not induced
   by God's blessings to serve him. The Prophet indeed mentioned the
   benefits which God usually bestows on the good and the bad without
   distinction, -- that he gives rain and spring and autumn, and so
   regulates all the year as to ripen all the fruit; for by the appointed
   weeks he only means, that God so arranges the different parts of the
   year, that what men sow comes to maturity; and the word reserve, or
   keep, is intended to shew the same thing. For it is the same as though
   he had said, "The seasons through the whole year are so changed, that
   there is a regular succession of suitable weather preserved."

   We now then understand the Prophet's object: He shews that the Jews had
   been extremely thoughtless; for they did not regard the paternal favor
   of God as to their daily food, so as to be thereby moved to worship and
   serve Him. Paul, also, when addressing heathens, adduced this reason,

   "God," he says, "never left himself amarturon, without a testimony; for
   he gave rain and fruitful seasons,"
   (Acts 14:17)

   that is, he so arranged the seasons, that the care he takes of mankind
   may be thus seen as in a mirror. But it was the Prophet's object here
   to condemn the Jews for their ingratitude, because they did not
   consider how bountifully God had ever dealt with them and beyond what
   was common. For he had not only in an ordinary way allured them to
   himself by his benefits; but his object had been to attach them to
   himself by singular and unusual means. Since then he had shewn to them
   singular favors, the more base was their ingratitude; for they did not
   consider, that the many benefits which God conferred on them, were so
   many motives or allurements, by which he bound them as it were to
   himself.

   We now then see the Prophet's meaning, when he says, They have not
   said, "Let us fear Jehovah, who gives us rain; that is, the vernal rain
   and the rain that precedes the harvest, and that also in its season For
   hence God's providence shines forth, because the rain follows when the
   husbandmen have sown; and it supplies the earth with moisture; and then
   before the fruit ripens, God renders it plump by latter rain. And for
   the same purpose is added this, Who reserves the appointed weeks,
   (literally, the weeks of ordinances;) and he says, that they are the
   weeks of the harvest [152] It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [152] Blayney, following the Septuagint and the Vulgate, has rendered
   the latter clause thus, -- A sufficiency of the appointed things of
   harvest he secureth to us. But the Targum agrees with our version; and
   Gataker, Grotius, Venema, and others, take the same view, which is more
   expressive and more accordant with the passage, -- The weeks, the
   appointed seasons of harvest,
   He preserves for us. The word chqvt, means what is established, fixed,
   ordained, or appointed, as to time, place, course, portion, or law; and
   it is here, not in regimine, but in apposition with "weeks." -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 5:25

   25. Your iniquities have turned away these things, and your sins have
   withholden good things from you.

   25. Iniquitates vestrae averterunt haec, et scelera vestra prohibuerunt
   bonum a vobis.


   Inasmuch as hypocrites, according to what has been said before, often
   reply to God, and bring this and that objection, the Prophet here
   checks what they might have alleged; for he says that God's beneficence
   had been restrained by them, and that it was indeed their fault that it
   did not flow to them. For they might have thus objected, "Thou indeed
   preachest well respecting God's paternal bounty, because he supplies us
   with food; but the heat at one time burns our corn, the unseasonable
   rains at another time destroy our provisions: in a word, there is
   nothing certain, but all things are in a state of disorder." That he
   might therefore obviate this objection, he says, that it was on account
   of their wickedness and depravity, that God did not so regulate every
   part of the year as to allow them to see with their eyes his continued
   bounty.

   This passage is worthy of special notice: for God's paternal favor does
   not so continually shine forth in our daily sustenance, but that many
   clouds intercept our view. Hence it is, that ungodly men think that the
   years are now barren and then fruitful through mere chance. We indeed
   see nothing so regulated in every respect in the world, that the
   goodness of God can be seen without clouds and obstructions: but we do
   not consider whence this confusion proceeds, even because we obstruct
   God's access to us, so that his beneficence does not reach us. We throw
   heaven and earth into confusion by our sins. For were we in right order
   as to our obedience to God, doubtless all the elements would be
   conformable, and we should thus observe in the world an angelic
   harmony. But as our lusts tumultuate against God; nay, as we stir up
   war daily, and provoke him by our pride, perverseness, and obstinacy,
   it must needs be, that all things, above and below, should be in
   disorder, that the heavens should at one time appear cloudy, and that
   continuous rains should at another time destroy the produce of the
   earth, and that nothing should be unmixed and unstained in the world.
   This confusion then, in all the elements, is to be ascribed to our
   sins: and this is what is meant by the Prophet. Though indeed the
   reproof was then addressed to the Jews, we may yet gather hence a
   lesson of general instruction.

   These two things are then both true, -- that God is not without a
   testimony as to his beneficence, for he gives rain, he gives suitable
   seasons, he renders the earth fruitful, so as to supply us with food,
   -- and also, that heaven and earth are often in great disorder, that
   many things happen unseasonably, as though God had no care for us,
   because we provoke him by our sins, and thus confound and subvert the
   order of nature. These two things then ought to be viewed as connected
   together: for in the ordinary course of nature we may see the
   inconceivable bounty of God towards mankind; but as to accidental
   evils, the cause ought to be considered, even this -- because we do not
   allow God to govern the world in a regular and consistent order, but as
   far as we can we disturb and confound his providence. We hence see how
   suitably the Prophet has added this truth -- that the iniquities of the
   people had turned away the beneficence of God. [153] It afterwards
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [153] There is a correspondence between the terms here used, and those
   in the last verse. Their iniquities had turned aside, or diverted from
   their right course, the appointed seasons; and their sins had
   restrained the good, the seasonable rain which had been given them. As
   it is commonly the case in the prophets, the last thing mentioned in
   the previous verse, is the first thing referred to here, and then what
   is antecedently mentioned. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:26

   26. For among my people are found wicked men: they lay wait, as he that
   setteth snares; they set a trap, they catch men.

   26. Quia inventi sunt (aut, inveniuntur) in populo meo scelerati;
   aspicient (hoc est, astute observabunt) secundum ponere laqueos (hoc
   est, ac si decipulas tenderent;) perditionem locant, in qua homines
   capiant.


   What the previous verse contains is here confirmed, -- that the Jews,
   through their own fault, had deprived themselves of God's favor. It was
   necessary to do this; for otherwise they would have had some answer to
   give, inasmuch as hypocrites, being so perverse, do not easily yield.
   Hence the Prophet confirms what he had said, -- that there were wicked
   men among God's people. But this ought not to be confined to some among
   them, as it is done by interpreters, who seem not to explain quite
   correctly what the Prophet meant. For he does not reprove or condemn
   some only; but he says that the people, whom God had chosen, were
   wicked It is then a general condemnation of the whole people, when he
   says, that there were found wicked men among God's people; as though he
   had said, "The wicked are not to be sought among heathens, but iniquity
   so reigns among the elect people, that there is in them nothing sound,
   nothing pure."

   When he says found, I understand his meaning to be, found guilty, or
   convicted: for he means that their sins were not secret, so that they
   could escape by evasions; but he says that they were found, as thieves
   are found, according to a common saying, in the very act of stealing.
   The Prophet then intimates that there was no need of long dispute, as
   though the Jews could find out some excuse, for they were manifestly
   guilty. But it was much more disgraceful that they should be found
   wicked, than that the blind and unbelieving should be found so; for God
   had adopted them as his people on this condition -- that holiness and
   purity of life should prevail among them. Since then they were not only
   sinners, but rsym, reshoim, wholly impious and wicked, it was, as I
   have said, a far more atrocious thing. And thus he takes away from them
   every pretense for evasion.

   He afterwards urges still farther his charge, and says, that every one
   looked, or espied, for this is the meaning of the verb svr, shur. He
   indeed changes the number, but the sense is not rendered thereby more
   obscure: and to look here, is to lie in wait. Then look, or lie in
   wait, did every one, as though they were laying snares as fowlers do.
   He then says, that they were furnished with snares, by which they
   dragged men into destruction, after having caught them. [154] What is
   particular is here mentioned for what is general: for the Prophet meant
   to shew that there was then no faithfulness nor integrity among the
   people, for every one by frauds and wicked crafts oppressed the simple.
   Since then they were so perfidious one towards another, he fitly
   compares them to fowlers, who by their snares entrap the simple birds:
   but he explains this more clearly in what follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [154] There is a grammatical difficulty connected with the word ysvrThe
   Septuagint, and the Syriac and the Arabic, omit the word, and the
   Vulgate renders it in the plural number, as if it was ysvrv, which
   Blayney adopts. Venema renders it "upright" or just, and considers the
   root to be ysrand refers to Micah 7:4, when the upright is said to be
   "sharper than a thorn hedge," that is, such as were counted or ought to
   have been "upright." The reference here is evidently to the judge, who
   assumed the office of an upright one. See verse 28. The literal version
   would then be as follows, -- For found among my people are the unjust;
   The upright is like the setter of snares; They have set up entrapping,
   Men they catch. Thus all the parts correspond, and what is said
   corresponds with Jeremiah 5:28. The verb rendered "set up, "means to
   settle, to constitute, to establish; the office of the upright, that
   is, of the judge, was set up as an office for entrapping, he being like
   a setter of snares. The "unjust" among the people, as stated here, were
   the judges; the word, rsis the perverter of justice, and stands in
   contrast with tsdq, who acts justly. -- Ed

   Jeremiah 5:27

   27. As a cage is full of birds, so are their houses full of deceit:
   therefore they are become great, and waxen rich.

   27. Sicuti cavea plena est ave (hoc est, avibus,) sic domus eorum
   plenae sunt fraude: propterea aucti sunt et ditati.


   Jeremiah goes on with the same subject. He made use, as we have said,
   of a similitude taken from fowling: he now applies this similitude to
   the Jews, -- that their houses were full of fraud, as the cage (some
   render it basket [155] ) is full of birds: for fowlers, when they go
   for game, carry with them either bags or cages or baskets. So then
   Jeremiah says, that they collected plunder on every side, so that their
   houses were full of frauds: but by fraud he means spoils, which they
   acquired by unjust means. It may at the first view seem an obscure
   language; but if we take the word mrmh, mereme, in a passive sense,
   there will be nothing ambiguous. The Prophet then does not use a
   language strictly correct when he says, that their houses were full of
   deceit or fraud; but they were full of spoils which they had acquired
   by deceit and fraud. Hence, what he means by fraud were the plunders by
   which they had become rich, as he afterwards explains.

   We now perceive, that the meaning of the Prophet is, -- that there was
   no longer a proof required, that the Jews circumvented the helpless and
   the poor, for their houses were filled with such spoils as made evident
   their wickedness: they had scraped together their riches by depriving
   the helpless and the poor of their substance. And hence he adds, By
   this have they increased and become rich It is probable that they
   gloried in their wealth, like thieves, whose trade is to plunder: for
   when they increased, they thought themselves raised above all danger.
   They were like courtiers, who by rapines and frauds and tyrannical
   violence, draw to themselves from all quarters the possessions of
   others, so that one got annually sixty thousands and another a hundred
   thousands; and then they became the more ferocious, because they
   thought that they could not be called to an account, being blinded by
   the splendor of their riches. But the Prophet here derides this
   besotted glorying, and says, "Behold, they are become great in the
   world, and they would have themselves to be on this account exalted;"
   increased have they, he says, and become rich; that is, "If any one
   will now search their houses, he will indeed find many things by which
   they make a display before the eyes of the simple; but they are nothing
   but rapines, plunders, frauds, spoils, thefts, and, in a word,
   robberies." This is what he simply means. He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [155] It is so rendered in Amos 8:1, 2. This was no doubt a
   wicker-basket or cage for birds, to keep them, and not a trap-cage, as
   suggested by the Septuagint and Vulgate versions. The Targum is, "the
   house of feeding." The comparison is between a cage full of birds,
   which had been caught by snares, nets, or traps, and houses filled with
   spoils, which had been procured by frauds. And were "full" rendered
   "filled, "as it might be, there would be no need of the metonymy
   supposed to be in the word "fraud," -- As the cage is filled with
   birds, So their houses are filled by means of fraud: Hence they have
   become great and grown rich. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:28

   28. They are waxen fat, they shine: yea, they overpass the deeds of the
   wicked: they judge not the cause, the cause of the fatherless, yet they
   prosper; and the right of the needy do they not judge.

   28. Impinguati sunt (nam smnvdeducitur ab oleo, perfusi sunt
   pinguedine, si Latine et proprie reddere velimus,) postea nitent (vel,
   sunt candidi, alludit ad pingues et bene saginatos, quorum cutis est
   nitida;) etiam excedunt (vel, quamvis excesserint) verba impii (hoc
   est, scelera impiorum:) causam non judicant, causam pupilli, et
   prosperantur; et judicium pauperum non judicant.


   Here the Prophet reproves those who were high in dignity, station, and
   wealth, and who wished at the same time to be deemed inviolable,
   because they were the rulers of the people. He had spoken before
   generally, but now he assails the higher orders, the king's counselors,
   the priests, the judges, and all endowed with authority. He says, that
   they were swoln with fatness, that they were shining, though they had
   exceeded, etc We see how he confirms what he had briefly referred to;
   for as they protected themselves under the pretense of being rich, that
   they might not be called to an account, he says, by way of concession,
   "I allow that ye are bright and splendid, and indeed that ye are all
   over gold; but whence is this splendor? whence is this specious
   appearance, which dazzles the eyes of the simple? Ye are bright, ye are
   fat, though ye have surpassed the words of the impious, that is, the
   ways, the doings, and the designs of the impious." He means, in short,
   that it was of no avail to the wicked, that by their aspect they
   terrified people, that they gained great respect by their riches, and
   made men afraid of them: the Prophet admits that they had honors,
   wealth, splendor, repute, dignity, and such things; but he says, at the
   same time, Ye have surpassed all the doings of the wicked [156] And
   then he brings this charge against them, that they did not judge
   judgment

   It hence appears that the Prophet was not dealing with the common
   people nor with private individuals; but that he openly and avowedly
   reproved the king's court and the judges. "They judge not judgment, "he
   says; which means, that they had no care for executing justice, but
   suffered thefts and robberies to go unpunished: and he still enhances
   their guilt and says, They judge not the judgment of the fatherless
   Pity towards young orphans is often found in those who are otherwise
   cruel; for that age, especially when deprived of all protection,
   touches our feelings in a peculiar manner. Since then young orphans
   were plundered with impunity, and found no defense from the judges,
   their dishonesty appeared most glaringly.

   And he says, that they yet prospered. He again repeats, by way of
   concession, what he had before intimated, -- that it was a foolish and
   vain pretense, that they openly boasted of their wealth, honors, and
   fortunes. How is this, he says? They prosper; but yet they judge not
   the judgment of the poor, that is, they help not the poor, but
   dissemble and connive at all the wrongs done to them. We now then see
   that he exposes to view the wickedness of the people, so that not even
   the principal men should be able to hide themselves; for the Lord shews
   that they had wholly neglected their duties, and were even destitute of
   all humanity. It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [156] Expounders differ as to the meaning of these words. They are
   partly omitted by the Septuagint and Syriac. The Vulgate is, "et
   praeterierunt sermones meos pessime -- and they have passed by my words
   very haughtily." The Targum is a loose version, "They have also
   transgressed the words of the law, they have done what is evil." Such
   meanings do not correspond with the context. The words literally are,
   "They have passed over (or, by) the words of wrong;" but as the term
   for "words" often means things, affairs, matters, the version may be,
   "matters of wrong," or wrong things. These "matters of wrong" are
   afterwards specified, as will be seen in the following version, -- 28.
   They have become fat, they have shined: Moreover, they have passed by
   matters of wrong; The cause they have not defended -- The cause of the
   orphan, yet have they prospered; And the right of the meek have they
   not pleaded. The word "moreover," may be rendered "though," as Blayney
   does, (see Nehemiah 6:1:) but the rest of the sentence is not so well
   rendered, -- Though they have gone beyond the claims of the wicked. He
   conceived that the meaning is, that they granted to the wicked man more
   than he claimed, while they denied justice to the orphan and the poor.
   But what is more accordant with the words is, that he states here what
   he afterward specifies. It is not properly the "poor" who are meant,
   but the quiet, the humble: for the poor, strictly speaking, had not
   much to lose; hence the judges were not bribed to allow them to become
   a prey to dishonest men. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 5:29

   29. Shall I not visit for these things? saith the Lord: shall not my
   soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

   29. An super hoc non visitabo dicit Jehova? an in gente quae talis est,
   non se ulciscetur anima mea?


   He repeats what we have before noticed, so there is no need of an
   explanation. But the repetition is not without its use; for the Jews
   had become so torpid, that all reproofs and threatenings were regarded
   with indifference. Hence God rouses them with great vehemence, Shall I
   not, he says, visit for these things? He takes it for granted, that we
   ought to be fully persuaded, that he is the judge of the world. It is
   the proper office of a judge to punish the wicked, and also to relieve
   the helpless and the oppressed, and to check the audacity of those who
   allow themselves every liberty. God then reasons here from his own
   nature and office, as though he had said, "Since I am God, can I suffer
   so much impiety and wantonness to prevail unpunished among my people?"
   Then he adds --

   On such a nation as this, shall not avenged be my soul?

   God transfers here to himself, as we have said elsewhere, what does not
   strictly belong to him; but it is the same as though he had said,
   "There is no one among earthly judges so void of feeling as to bear
   such indignities; for when the judge sees that he is treated with
   contempt by the wicked, is he not provoked?" Avenged then shall be my
   soul; as though he said, that he is not so soft, or so slothful, or so
   careless, as not to take vengeance on such wanton contempt. It follows
   --

   Jeremiah 5:30-31

   30. A wonderful and horrible thing is committed in the land;

   30. Stupor (vel, res stupenda) et foeditas in terra (vel, res pudenda;
   sr, unde nomen deductum est, significat proprie cogitare vel reputare;
   sed videtur per antiphrasin Deus hoc loco, ut aliis quibusdam, notare
   rem prodigiosam, quae non cadit sub sensum humanum, quasi diceret hoc
   non posse concipi neque apprehendi hominis mente; scio hoc posse videri
   novum, sed tamen subest optima ratio, ut mihi videtur. Postea addit.)

   31. The prophets prophesy falsely, and the priests bear rule by their
   means; and my people love to have it so: and what will ye do in the end
   thereof?

   31. Prophetae prophetant in mendacio, et sacerdotes dominantur per
   manum ipsorum (vel, accipiunt in manus suas,) et populus meus voluit
   ita (hoc est, ita vult et appetit:) et quid facietis in novissimo ejus?


   The Prophet, being not satisfied with the reproof which we have
   observed, speaks still more strongly against the wickedness of the
   people. He then says, that so deplorable was their state as to make all
   to feel amazed. A stupendous thing, he says, has happened, which
   exceeds all human conception, and cannot be comprehended. By the two
   words he uses, he intimates that the impiety of the people could not be
   expressed in words or could not be conceived by the mind; for it was a
   monstrous thing. This is the meaning. [157]

   Let us now see what was this monstrous thing which the Prophet here
   refers to, and which he abhorred. The prophets, he says, prophesy
   falsely It was no doubt enough to make all astonished, when these
   impostors assumed the name of prophets at Jerusalem, where God had
   chosen his habitation and his sanctuary: how great and how base a
   profanation was it of God's name? There were indeed at that time
   impostors everywhere, who boasted that they were God's prophets, who in
   many places passed as oracles the delusions of Satan; but to see the
   ministers of the devil in the very sanctuary of God, (which was then
   the only one in the world,) even in the very city where he had, as it
   has been said, his habitation and dwelling, was a monstrous thing,
   which ought to have made all men astonished. It is indeed a detestable
   thing under the Papacy, when monks and similar unprincipled men ascend
   the pulpit, and there most shamefully pretend that they are the true
   prophets of God, and faithful teachers; but still it would be doubly
   monstrous, were any among us to corrupt pure doctrine with their errors
   and infect the people with their superstitions. It was not then without
   reason that Jeremiah introduced his subject by saying, that it was an
   astonishing thing and hardly to be conceived, when prophets prophesied
   falsely

   He then adds, Priests receive into their hands; so some render the
   words: but there may be a twofold meaning. Sampson is said in Judges
   14:9, to have received into his hands honey from the lion, and the same
   verb is found there: but as it means also to rule, to govern, the
   exposition most suitable to this place is, -- that the priests ruled by
   the means of the false prophets. At the same time, if any one takes the
   other view, -- that the priests received into their hands, that is,
   that they gathered and accumulated gifts from all quarters, the meaning
   would not be unsuitable. [158]

   However this may be, the Prophet evidently shews that there was a
   mutual collusion between the false prophets and the priests. The false
   prophets, he says, deceive the people by their flatteries, and what do
   the priests? It was their duty to oppose them: they receive, he says,
   into their hands; that is, they are satisfied, for they see that these
   fallacies bring gain to them, and therefore they easily assent to what
   is taught by the false prophets. The same thing is to be seen at this
   day under the Papacy: the monks flatter the people and prop up the
   whole system of Popery; and hence these unprincipled men call
   themselves the chariots of the Pope; for the Pope is carried as it were
   on four wheels -- the four mendicant orders. And this they boast, when
   they wish to shew what adepts they are in lying. The Pope then is
   carried by the four wheels of the mendicants. We see how he has honored
   and daily honors these mendicants with privileges, and why? Because
   they prop up his tyranny. Such was at that time the state of the
   people; the priests took their prey, and the false prophets snatched
   also a part of it, like these hungry dogs at this day; who yet do not
   act so oppressively as the Pope: they lick as it were his seat, like
   dogs; while he and his mitered bishops devour the fattest spoils. The
   meaning then, that they received into their hands, is not unsuitable.

   But when we consider the main drift of the passage, it is more in
   harmony with it to say, that the priests ruled by their means; for
   without the false prophets they could not have retained their influence
   over the people; they must have been repudiated by them all. Since then
   they ruled by their means, there was a mutual collusion between them.

   He then adds, And my people have wished it to be so The common people,
   no doubt, exculpated themselves, as they do at this day, who hold forth
   this excuse as their shield, "O, we are not learned, we have never been
   in school, and what can we do but to follow our bishops?" Thus, then,
   at this day, the lower orders, the multitude, seek to cast off every
   blame from themselves. But the Prophet says here, that the people loved
   to have things so. And, doubtless, we shall find that to be ever true
   which is said in Deuteronomy 13:3, that when false prophets come, it is
   for the purpose of trying God's people, whether they from the heart
   love God. It is then his object to try our religion, whenever he gives
   loose reins to impostors and false prophets: for every one who truly
   loves God will be preserved by his Spirit from being led away by such
   deceivers. When, therefore, ignorant men are deluded, it is certain
   that they are justly punished for their neglect and contempt of God,
   because they have not been sufficiently attentive to his service; yea,
   because they have wished for impostors, according to what has been also
   often said by the monks, "The world wishes to be deceived, let it be
   deceived in the name of the devil." These impostors have become so
   shameless, as to boast that they are the ministers of Satan to deceive
   men. However, that common saying has been found true; for the world is
   never deceived except with its own consent, and willingly; for those
   who are the most ignorant close their eyes against clear light, and
   shun God as much as they can, and seek to hide themselves in darkness,
   according to what Christ says,

   "Whosoever committeth sin hateth the light." (John 3:20)

   The Prophet adds in the last place, And what will ye do at last, or at
   the end of it? Some omit the pronoun h, he; and others apply it to the
   false prophets and the priests; but the Prophet, I have no doubt,
   refers to Jerusalem, What will ye do at the end of it? For we know that
   as Jerusalem had been founded by God's hand, and while it had him as
   its protector and guardian, it was safe; but this was a false
   confidence, when they despised God and gloried in their wickedness.
   What, then, he says, will ye do at the end of it? as though he had
   said, "You deceive yourselves, if you think that this city will be
   perpetual; for its overthrow is nigh at hand: what then will ye do,
   when the city itself shall bc destroyed, except that you shall be all
   destroyed together with it?" [159]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [157] The words literally are, -- Amazement and horribleness has been
   done in the land. That is, what occasioned both had been done, or what
   ought to have filled all with the feeling of amazement and horror. --
   Ed.

   [158] The Septuagint and the Vulgate have, "And the priests have
   applauded with their own hands;" and the Targum, "And the priests have
   helped their hands." Both mean the same thing, though the words are
   different: and Blayney gives the same meaning, "And the priests have
   concurred with them." Horsley says that the words literally are, "And
   the priests go down according to their hands;" that is, he adds, "the
   priests go which way their bands permit; i.e., the priests are directed
   by them." Though the points lead us to regard yrdvas future from rdh,
   to bear rule; yet the context requires it to be in the past tense, as
   the previous verb is so, and that which follows: and therefore it must
   be yrd, to come down, to descend. When followed by l, as here, the
   preposition never means "according to," as Horsley renders it, but
   ever, upon, toward or against, and mostly "upon." See Exodus 9:19;
   Numbers 11:9; Psalm 7:16; Psalm 72:6. Therefore the literal rendering
   is this, -- And the priests have descended upon their hands. An
   idiomatic expression, which seems to mean, that the priests assisted
   the prophets, according to what is expressed by the Targum. "Hand"
   signify labor, efforts; the priests joined their efforts to those of
   the prophets. To "concur with them" is too feeble: the line may be
   rendered, -- And the priests have aided them. -- Ed.

   [159] The "it" refers rather to the "strange and horrible thing" which
   had been done in the land, -- But what will ye do at the end of it?
   That is, when this dreadful thing shall come to an end, when the
   prophets, encouraged by the priests and approved by the people, shall
   be found liars, what then shall you do? The Septuagint render the last
   words by "meta tauta -- after these things," referring evidently to the
   particulars just mentioned, the acts of the prophets, priests, and
   people: but the same thing is meant. Then in the next chapter he
   reminds them of the approaching destruction, which the false prophets
   denied. -- Ed

   Prayer

   Grant, Almighty God, that since we have been hitherto extremely deaf to
   thy many exhortations, and also to those threatenings by which thou
   hast sharply stimulated us to repentance, -- O grant, that this
   perverseness may not always remain in us, but that we may at length
   submit to thee, not only for a short time, but continually, so that we
   may to the end devote ourselves wholly to thee, and thus glorify thy
   name, that we may at last become partakers of that glory, which has
   been procured for us by the blood of thy only -- begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 6:1

   1. O ye children of Benjamin, gather yourselves to flee out of the
   midst of Jerusalem, and blow the trumpet in Tekoa, and set up a sign of
   fire in Bethhaccerem: for evil appeareth out of the north, and great
   destruction.

   1. Congregamini filii Benjamin e medio Jerusalem, et in Thekua clangite
   tuba, et Bethhacherem tollite signum; quia malum visum est ab Aquilone
   et afflictio magna.


   WE have already seen that oftentimes punishment is not only mentioned
   by this Prophet as being nigh at hand, but is also set as it were
   before our eyes; and we have shewn the reason for this, -- because men
   are not only deaf, but wholly thoughtless, whenever God threatens them.
   As reproofs make no impressions, and even threatenings are not
   sufficient to arouse and awake them, it is necessary to set before them
   vivid descriptions, and to represent the event as present. Jeremiah
   continues this mode of teaching; he addresses the tribe of Benjamin;
   for one half of Jerusalem was in the territory of that tribe; And as he
   was from Anathoth, he addresses his own people and kindred rather than
   others, as he could use greater freedom. Had he directly reproved the
   Jews, they might not have so well borne with him; but as he begins with
   his neighbors, the tribe of Benjamin, it became more easy to bear his
   reproofs.

   Some understand the words, "Be ye assembled, and flee;" others read,
   "Go ye in haste, "but for what reason I know not. I do not think that
   flight is meant here; but I rather regard the Prophet as ironically
   encouraging the citizens of Jerusalem and their neighbors to go forth,
   as it is usual, to meet their enemies; and this we may easily learn
   from the context: Be ye assembled, he says, from the midst of
   Jerusalem; that is, Be aroused and go forth. And he indirectly condemns
   their indulgences, for they had been lying as it were in the bosom of
   their mother. Like infants in the womb, the Jews were not apprehensive
   of any danger; they indulged themselves, and were wholly secure and
   thoughtless. Hence he says, "From the midst of Jerusalem be ye
   assembled." [160]

   Then he says, Blow ye the trumpet in Tekoa. They were wont, no doubt,
   when any danger was at hand, to blow the trumpet in that town; and then
   the citizens of Jerusalem went forth in large bodies to resist their
   enemies: for the Prophet follows the usual custom, and speaks as of
   things well known. And set up a sign on the house of Haccerem, hkrm. No
   doubt this place was so called, because many forces were planted there.
   It means literally the house of the vineyard. It is, indeed, a proper
   name; but its etymology ought to be borne in mind; for as vines were
   usually planted on hills, it is probable that this place stood high;
   and a sign might have been thence given to many around. He therefore
   says, "Set up a sign, ms't, meshat, a word derived from ns', nesha,
   which is also found here: but some interpreters render it "fire" or
   bonfire; others "banner;" and others "tower." They who render it tower
   or citadel have no reason in their favor; for towers could not have
   been suddenly raised up. But it is probable, as I have already said,
   that thence a sign was given to those around, as from a watch -- tower,
   whenever there was any cause of fear. I am therefore inclined to take
   the word as meaning a sign; for the word "banner" would have been too
   restricted. Literally it is, "Elevate an elevation." The word "sign,
   "then, is the most suitable. [161]

   For an evil, he says, from the north has appeared [162] The Prophet
   points out whence ruin would soon come, even from the Chaldeans, for
   God had appointed them as the ministers and the executioners of his
   vengeance in destroying Jerusalem and the whole tribe of Judah. We
   hence see what the Prophet means: he ridicules the Jews, who were
   asleep in their vices, promising to themselves impunity, and despising
   all the judgments of God: "Be now assembled, "he says, "from the midst
   of Jerusalem;" as though he said, that they could not be safe in the
   city, without going forth to meet their enemies: "Blow ye the trumpet
   in Tekoa;" and then he adds, "Let the inhabitants of Bethhaccerem,
   "that is, of the house of the vineyard, "set up signals; for an evil is
   nigh at hand, and a great distress;" from whom? from the Chaldeans. The
   prediction was more likely to be believed, when he thus pointed out
   their enemies, as it were, by his finger. It afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [160] See note on Jeremiah 4:6. The meaning of the verb is, no doubt,
   to haste, or to hasten. It is singular that the Septuagint render it in
   Jeremiah 4:6, "Haste ye," and here, "Be ye strong." The Targum renders
   it "migrate," or, remove ye. The idea of assembling it never has. The
   line rightly rendered is, -- Hasten, ye sons of Benjamin, from the
   midst of Jerusalem. Where Blayney got the phrase, "Retire in a body,"
   it is difficult to say. -- Ed.

   [161] "Raise ye a sign (semeion)" is the Septuagint and the Targum;
   "Raise ye a banner (vexillum)" is the Vulgate and the Syriac. The word
   has no connection with "fire," as mentioned in our version, which has
   been derived from the Rabbins. Blayney's rendering is, "light up a
   fire-beacon;" but the words admit of no such meaning. It is a general
   expression, and may be rendered, "Raise ye a signal;" there is no
   definition as to what the signal was to be. -- Ed

   [162] Literally, "For evil is seen from the north." So the Vulgate and
   the Targum. The verb in Kal, Niphal, and Hiphil, is rendered "look" in
   our version. See Genesis 19:28; Judges 5:28; Deuteronomy 26:15. But in
   Niphal, as it is found here, it may be rendered passively, "is seen;"
   and also in Psalm 85:12; and in Cant. 6:10, and in most other places.
   Blayney renders it, "is seen coming onwards," which is a paraphrase. --
   Ed.

   Jeremiah 6:2-3

   2. I have likened the daughter of Zion to a comely and delicate woman

   2. Quietae (alii vertunt, speciosam; sed alter sensus melius quadrat,
   quietae igitur) et delicatae similem feci filiam Sion.

   3. The shepherds with their flocks shall come unto her; they shall
   pitch their tents against her round about; they shall feed every one in
   his place.

   3. Super eam venient pastores et greges eorum, figent adversus eam
   tabernecula sua in circuitu; pascent vir ad manum suam (hoc est,
   quisque ad locum suum).


   As the place, where the Prophet was born, was pastoral, he retained
   many expressions derived from his education; for God did not divest his
   servants of every natural endowment when he appointed them to teach his
   people. Hence the Prophet here speaks according to notions imbibed in
   his early age and childhood. The daughter of Sion, he says, is like a
   quiet maid, that is, one dwelling at leisure and enjoying herself; and
   yet she would be exposed to many indignities, for come shall shepherds,
   and around fix their tents; and the whole country would be subjected to
   plunder. But it is doubtful whether the Prophet says, that the daughter
   of Sion might be compared to a maid, tender and delicate, dwelling at
   ease and cheerful, or whether he means, that rest had been for a time
   granted to the people. There seems, indeed, to be no great difference,
   though there is some, between the two explanations.

   If we take the verb, dmyty, damiti, in the sense of comparing, as
   interpreters do, then it is the same as though the Prophet had said, "I
   seem to see in the state of Jerusalem the image of a tender and
   delicate maid." Thus Jeremiah speaks in his own name. But the sentence
   may be more fitly applied to God, -- that he had made the daughter of
   Sion quiet for a time, and had given her peace with her enemies, so
   that she lived at ease and cheerfully.

   Though these two views differ, yet the subject itself is nearly the
   same. The Prophet, no doubt, condemns here the Jews for their extreme
   torpidity, inasmuch as they had wholly misapplied the quietness granted
   them by God. He then proves that they were very thoughtless and stupid
   in thinking that their tranquillity would be perpetual, for it was
   God's favor, and only for a time. Hence he says, that the Jews were
   until that very day like a tender maid. For though the country of the
   ten tribes had been laid waste, and all had been driven away into
   exile, yet the kingdom of Judah continued safe. They had, indeed, been
   plundered by enemies, but in comparison with their brethren they had
   been very kindly treated. This, then, is the reason, why he says that
   they were like a maid delicate and tender. [163]

   But he afterwards adds, Come shall shepherds, etc.; that is, there is
   no ground for the Jews to deceive themselves, because God has hitherto
   spared them, and restrained the assaults of enemies; for now shall come
   shepherds. He keeps to the same metaphor; "come, "he says, "shall
   shepherds, "together with their flocks; that is, come shall leaders of
   armies with their forces. But I have already reminded you, that the
   Prophet here has a regard to the city where he had been born, and
   adopts a pastoral language. Come then shall shepherds with their
   flocks; fix shall they their tents, and feed shall each in his place,
   he means that the whole of Jerusalem would be so much in the power of
   enemies, that each one would freely choose his own part or his own
   portion; for when there is any fear, then the shepherds gather their
   flocks, that they may assist one another; but when everything is in
   their own power, they move here and there as they please. This free
   acting then intimates, that the Jews would have no strength, and would
   be helped by no aid; but that the shepherds would surround the whole
   city and besiege it: every one, he says, would be in his own place.
   [164] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [163] Calvin, with our version, has followed the Vulgate and the Syriac
   in this verse. Both the Septuagint and the Targum are widely different.
   The former have, "And taken away shall be thy height, daughter of
   Sion;" the latter, "Fair and delicate, how hast thou corrupted thy
   ways? Therefore confounded is the assembly of Sion." The Arabic is the
   same with the Septuagint, only it has "pride" instead of "height"
   (thoupsos) Some have viewed the two first words as substantives, and
   have rendered the verse thus, -- To a pasture and a delightful
   habitation Have I likened the daughter of Sion. Disposed to this view
   were Gataker and Lowth. But what Blayney has said is true, that
   whenever the verb here used has the sense of likeness, it is followed
   by a preposition. Besides, the two first words are not substantives but
   adjectives, as the form, especially of the last, clearly shews. The
   verb dmytyhas in various passages the sense of thinking, counting,
   esteeming, regarding; as the result of comparing things together. See
   Judges 20:5; Esther 4:13; Psalm 48:9. There is a passage in Ezekiel
   32:2, which is like the present, only the verb there is in Niphal; its
   literal rendering I consider to be the following: "The young lion of
   the nations art thou deemed," or, thought to be. The literal rendering
   of this verse is as follows, -- Home-resident and delicate,
   Have I deemed the daughter of Sion. She was so regarded by God. Not
   like other nations, migratory, she had a home allotted to her by God
   himself; and she was nursed and sustained with all tenderness, like a
   delicate person. But owing to her sins, foreigners, as stated in the
   next verse, would come and take possession of her house, and deprive
   her of her enjoyments. -- Ed.

   [164] There is evidently a vor a y wanted before the second verb in
   this verse. The Septuagint and the Syriac read with v, and the Targum
   with y. The same is the case with the third verb, rv; but there are two
   MSS. which have the vhere, with which the Septuagint, the Syriac, and
   the Targum agree. Then the version would be, -- To her shall come
   shepherds and their flocks, And pitch by her their tents around, And
   they shall feed, every one in his border. "To pitch against her" seems
   improper: the proposition lmeans by or near, as well as against. And
   yddoes not mean properly place, but side or border. It is indeed
   rendered place often in our version. See Numbers 2:17; Deuteronomy
   23:12; Isaiah 56:5, 11; and in Isaiah 57:8, "quarter." The ancient
   versions differ; the word seems not to have been understood. It is
   rendered by the Septuagint, "by his hand;" by the Vulgate, "those under
   his hand;" and by the Targum, "his neighbor." -- Ed

   Jeremiah 6:4-5

   4. Prepare ye war against her; arise, and let us go up at noon. Woe
   unto us! for the day goeth away, for the shadows of the evening are
   stretched out.

   4. Sanctificate super eam proelium; surgite et ascendamus meridie: vae
   nobis, quia inclinavit dies, quia extensae sunt umbrae vespertinae.

   5. Arise, and let us go by night, and let us destroy her palaces.

   5. Surgite et ascendamus noctu, et demoliamur palatia ejus.


   The Prophet leaves here the similitude he had adopted; for he does not
   now speak of shepherds, but expressly describes the enemies, as coming
   with great force, and furiously attacking and laying waste both the
   city and the whole of Judea. He was before like God's herald,
   proclaiming war; but he now, by a sort of personification, introduces
   the Chaldeans encouraging one another to fight. Sanctify, he says, war
   against her. So the Hebrews speak; for in all ages wars, we know, were
   proclaimed by a solemn rite. God, no doubt, has implanted this feeling
   in all nations, that no wars should be suddenly undertaken, and that no
   arms should be taken up except for a lawful reason: for the
   proclamation of war was a testimony, that they did not contend with one
   another but for causes just and necessary. It is indeed true, that wars
   have been often undertaken rashly, and for no just causes; but yet it
   was God's will that this custom should remain and continue in use, in
   order to take away excuse from men given to cruelty, or led by ambition
   to disturb the world and harass others. This then is the reason for
   this manner of speaking, Sanctify war; it is the same as though they
   declared and proclaimed a just war by a solemn ceremony. It was
   according to the common practice that the Prophet spoke when he said,
   Sanctify war against her, as we say in our language, Sommez -- la

   Then follows the readiness of the enemies, yea, their incredible
   quickness, for he shews that they were extremely swift, Arise ye, and
   let us ascend at mid-day. But they who come to assail a city do so
   usually in the morning. When the heat prevails, it is not a suitable
   time, for the heat of the sun debilitates the body. Then enemies rest
   when night comes, except an unexpected advantage should offer itself:
   but having been refreshed, they rise early with recruited strength for
   fighting; they scale the walls or assail the city by other means, or
   beat down the walls by warlike instruments: but to begin the work at
   mid-day, when a city is to be attacked, is by no means usual. Hence the
   Prophet intimates, that so ripened was God's judgment, that the
   Chaldeans, after having come to the walls of the city, would not wait,
   no, not even a few hours. Arise ye, and let us ascend at mid-day

   He then subjoins, Alas for us, for declined has the day, and the
   evening shadows are extended. He employs a military language; for
   soldiers, we know, are for the most part fierce and barbarous, and
   never speak in moderate terms. They have ever in their mouths, "Alas
   for us!" or they use some other words, reproachful either to God or to
   men. The Prophet then expresses the words of the soldiers; for he
   describes the Chaldeans, and represents, as I have said, to the Jews
   the scene as present, that he might dissipate their delusions, in which
   they were wholly asleep. Alas, then, for us! for declined has already
   the day, already have the evening shadows extended: they who have
   added, "Too far," because they had declined more than usual, have
   mistaken the meaning of the Prophet. It is the same as though he had
   said, "Already the night is nigh, and why should we give over? and why
   do we not make such an impetuous assault as to take the city in a
   moment?" This is the real meaning of the words.

   He afterwards adds, Arise ye, and let us ascend in the night; that is,
   "As we cannot take the city in six hours, (from mid-day to night were
   six hours, for they divided the day into twelve hours, and the first
   hour began at the rising of the sun, and the twelfth hour closed the
   day,) as then we cannot take the city in six hours, let us attack it in
   the night." We see here how graphically is described the extreme ardor
   of their enemies; for they were urged on by the hidden power of God;
   and this is what Jeremiah intended to express. [165] He afterwards adds
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [165] These two verses seem to have been the language of the enemies on
   their march towards Jerusalem. When men go to a chief city from any
   quarter, it is always ascending. When on their march, they encouraged
   one another to ascend by mid-day, as v may be rendered, but the day
   declined before they reached the city; then they encouraged each other
   to continue their march in the night, -- Proclaim ye against her war:
   Rise, and let us ascend by mid-day. -- Alas for us! for declined has
   the day, For extended have become the shadows of the evening: Arise,
   and let us ascend by night, And destroy her palaces. The last word is
   rendered "foundations" by the Septuagint, -- "houses" by the Vulgate,
   -- and "palaces" by the Targum. This is an instance of the loose way in
   which the versions were often made. To "sanctify war," is not to
   prepare it, but to proclaim it, as Calvin says, by a solemn ceremony.
   -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 6:6

   6. For thus hath the Lord of hosts said, Hew ye down trees, and cast a
   mount against Jerusalem: this is the city to be visited; she is wholly
   oppression in the midst of her.

   6. Quia sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Excidite ligna et fundite super
   Jerusalem aggerem (alii vertunt, balistam; sed nomen aggeris hic melius
   convenit;) ipsa est urbs visitationis (hic variant interpretes, et
   quidem exercitati in lingua Hebraea sic depravant sensum ut piqeat
   referre quid ipsi ausi sunt scribere,) tota oppressio (vel, rapina; nam
   sqsignificat rapere, rapina ergo) in medio ejus.


   The Prophet now points out the cause why a near calamity awaited both
   the city and the whole of Judea. Two things were necessary to be done:
   as the Jews had hardened themselves in their thoughtlessness, so that
   they disregarded all the threatenings of the prophets, it was necessary
   to expose and reprove this stupidity. This is what the Prophet has
   hitherto done. But the other thing needful to be done was, to make the
   Jews to know that they had not to do with the Chaldeans or other
   nations, but with God himself, with whom they had for a long time
   carried on war. The Prophet then, after having set before the eyes of
   his own kindred the calamity which was then nigh at hand, shews now
   that God was its author.

   Thus saith Jehovah of hosts. He reminds them here of the judgment of
   God, lest they thought that they could overcome their enemies, even if
   they fought with the greatest ardor and the greatest courage, for they
   could not overcome God. Thus then saith the God of hosts; as though he
   had said, "The Chaldeans will indeed bring their forces, which shall be
   great and strong; but the contest will be now with God, whom ye have so
   often and for a long time and so pertinaciously provoked." Thus then
   saith now the God of hosts, --

   Cut ye down wood; that is, "The Chaldeans will not of themselves attack
   you, but they will fight for God, and serve him as hired soldiers." As
   we have seen elsewhere that God blows the trumpet, and sends by a hiss
   for whomsoever he pleases; so also he says now that the Chaldeans would
   carry on war under the authority and banner of God. Command them then
   did God to cut down wood and to cast up a mound. We indeed know that
   warlike engines were made of timber, but the most suitable word here,
   as it is evident, is mound.

   It follows, She is the city of visitation. Jeremiah shews here that God
   would justly act towards the Jews, though with much severity, because
   they had nearly become putrid in their vices; for this reason he calls
   it the city of visitation. They therefore who render the words, "that
   it may be laid waste, "or, "it is laid waste, "misconceive the meaning;
   and indeed they touch neither heaven nor earth, for they consider not
   the Prophet's design, but only dwell on the words. But it is certain,
   that Jerusalem is called the city of visitation, because God had
   exercised long patience and suspended punishment, until the ripened
   time of vengeance came, so that it could no longer be endured, inasmuch
   as it had become more and more corrupt through the forbearance of God.
   It is, he says, the city of visitation; that is, "The time of extreme
   vengeance is now come; for I have tried all means to see whether there
   was any hope of repentance; but I now find that she is wholly
   irreclaimable. She is then the city of visitation; its ruin cannot be
   suspended any longer."

   The Prophet obviates here, as I have already said, all those complaints
   which the Jews were ever ready to make; for they were wont to murmur
   when any severity appeared, and say, "God deals cruelly with us; where
   is his covenant? where is that paternal kindness which he has promised
   to us?" As then the Jews were wont thus to expostulate with God, the
   Prophet says that it was the city of visitation, and the whole of it,
   and not a part only. As then there was nothing pure in it, he says that
   it could no longer be spared: and he adds one kind of evil; but stating
   a part for the whole, he means (as it is said elsewhere, Jeremiah 7:11)
   that Jerusalem was a den of thieves: he therefore says that it was full
   of rapines, and that oppression was in its very bowels. [166] It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [166] The two last lines may be thus rendered, -- She, the city, to be
   visited is the whole of it:
   Oppression is in the midst of it. The verb hphqdis an infinite Niphal.
   Some, not perhaps without reason, have rendered the first line, "For
   thus has Jehovah of hosts said." -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:7

   7. As a fountain casteth out her waters, so she casteth out her
   wickedness: violence and spoil is heard in her; before me continually
   is grief and wounds.

   7. Sicuti scaturire facit puteus aquas suas (hoc est, sicuti scaturiunt
   aquae ex fonte, vel, puteo,) sic scaturire fecit malitiam suam;
   violentia et deceptio (aut, vastatio) audita fuit in ea coram facie mea
   assidue, dolor et percussio (alii vertunt, plagam; sed nomen
   percussionis melius convenit.)


   The Prophet enlarges on what he had said in the last verse; for he had
   shewn, by mentioning one kind of evil, that Jerusalem was a den of
   thieves, as oppression dwelt in the midst of it. But he now, by a
   comparison, amplifies his former statement, and says, that violence,
   oppression, devastation, grief, and smiting, streamed forth like waters
   from a fountain. It is possible for many vices to break out from a
   place, but repentance afterwards follows; but when men cease not, and
   heap vices on vices, it then appears that they swell with wickedness,
   and even burst with it, as they cannot repress it: they are like a
   fountain, which ever bubbles up, and cannot contain its own waters. We
   hence see the object of the Prophet.

   The word vvr, bur, means a fountain, and v'r, bar, means also a
   fountain, or a well, and they are no doubt synonymous: and hence
   appears the mistake of a very learned man among the Hebrews, who makes
   a difference between the two, and says that the first is a cistern,
   which receives waters, but has no streaming. That this is false appears
   from the words of the Prophet; for a cistern does not cast forth water.

   But with regard to what is taught, we sufficiently understand that what
   the Prophet means is, -- that the Jews had so given up themselves to
   their vices, that they were ever contriving some new way of doing evil,
   as waters never cease to stream forth from the fountain; and it is a
   proof, as I have said, that a nation is wholly irreclaimable, when
   there is no cessation from evil deeds, when there is no intermission of
   injuries, when men ever indulge in their vices; and as the Jews could
   not deny that such was the atrocity of their wickedness, the Prophet
   again assumes the name of God, and says, Heard have been oppressions,
   and smitings are before me; as though he had said, "They will gain
   nothing by evasions, for if they make a hundred excuses before men, it
   will be wholly useless to them when they shall come before God's
   tribunal." And he again adds the adverb dymt, tamid, continually, which
   answers to the perpetual streaming of waters. [167] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [167] The verse, literally rendered, is as follows: -- 7. As cast forth
   does a spring its waters, So cast forth is her wickedness: Violence and
   plunder are heard of in her; Before me continually are wounding and
   smiting. The first verb is in Hiphil, the second is in Huphal.
   "Violence" was the visible act; "plunder" or spoiling was the object or
   the motive; "wounding" was the effect; "smiting" was the cause. Such is
   often found to be the way of stating things observed by the Prophets.
   Blayney renders the two last words "sickness and smiting," and adds,
   that the two words are a Hendiadis, and signify "sickness occasioned by
   blows." The true reason for the order is what has been stated: it is
   according to what is commonly done in Scripture; what is found often is
   not the progressive, but the retrogressive order. The Septuagint and
   the Targum have strangely rendered this verse in a manner wholly
   inconsistent with the context; nor are the other versions much better.
   The Hebrew is plain enough. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:8

   8. Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, lest my soul depart from thee; lest
   I make thee desolate, a land not inhabited.

   8. Erudire Jerusalem, ne discedat (vel, avellatur) anima mea abs to; ne
   ponam to desertum (vel, solitudinem) et terram inhabitabilem (hoc est,
   quae non habitatur.)


   Though the Prophet had spoken as though there was no remedy for the
   evils of Jerusalem, he yet exhorts it to seek peace with God, and
   addresses men past remedy in his name. It is then the same as though
   God was stopping in the middle course of his wrath, and saying, "What
   is to be done? Shall I destroy the city which I have chosen?" He then
   attributes here to God a paternal feeling, as we also find in several
   other places: God appeared as unwilling to proceed to extreme rigor in
   punishing his people.

   "Alas! I will now take vengeance on mine enemies,"
   he says by Isaiah. (Isaiah 1:24)

   He called them enemies, and justly too; for as it was said before, they
   ceased not to carry on war against him; but he spoke with grief: "Alas!
   must I take vengeance on mine enemies; I would, however, willingly
   spare them, were it possible." God is not indeed subject to grief or to
   repentance; but his ineffable goodness cannot be otherwise expressed to
   us but by such mode of speaking. So also, in this place, we see that
   God as it were restrains himself; for he had previously commanded the
   enemies to ascend quickly the walls, to overturn the towers, and to
   destroy the whole city; but now, as though he had repented, he says, Be
   instructed, [168] Jerusalem; that is, "Can we not yet be reconciled?"
   It is like the conduct of an offended father, who intends to punish his
   son, and yet desires to moderate his displeasure, and to blend some
   indulgence with rigor. Be then instructed; that is, "There is yet room
   for reconciliation, if thou wishest; provided thou shewest thyself
   willing to relinquish that perverseness by which thou hast hitherto
   provoked me, I will in return prove myself to be a father."

   There is no doubt but the object of the threatenings of the prophets
   was to lead the people to know their sins, and suppliantly to seek
   pardon; for why were the unbelieving threatened, except that God
   thereby proved whether they were healable? It is indeed true that the
   reprobate are known by God, and that God does not try or seek to find
   what is in their hearts, as though he did not know their obstinacy; but
   as I have already said, God speaks here after the manner of men: and he
   also shews what is the end of teaching, which is to lead men to
   repentance; and this cannot be done without giving them the hope of
   pardon and reconciliation. The Prophet thus briefly shews here for what
   purpose he had hitherto so dreadfully threatened the Jews, even to lead
   them at length to repentance.

   Lest torn shall be my soul from thee [169] Here God more clearly shews
   that he was as yet restrained by love. He alludes no doubt to a
   similitude which we have observed in another place; for God sustains
   the character of a spouse to his Church; and hence he shews, that he
   had not yet divested himself of that love which a husband has towards
   his wife. For a husband, when grievously offended at his wife, cannot
   immediately throw aside his conjugal affection; some feeling of this
   kind will ever remain. And we have seen in the fourth chapter, that God
   surpasses all husbands in kindness; for he says there, "When a
   repudiated wife has found another husband, will the former receive her
   again? Return to me, thou harlot, return to me, thou strumpet and
   adulteress, and I am ready to pardon thee." It is the same course that
   God pursues here, "Be instructed, Jerusalem, lest my soul wholly depart
   from thee;" as though he had said, "Even though I am now angry, and
   have resolved severely to punish thy perfidy and rebellion, I shall yet
   be reconciled to thee, provided thou returnest." And it is added, Lest
   I make thee a desolate land, a land uninhabited

   The Prophet in short shews in this verse, that however grievously
   offended God was with his people, there was yet a hope of pardon; for
   he would be propitious to the people, if they turned and humbly
   confessed their sins, and sought to return into favor with him. It
   follows --

   [168] Or, "Be warned," or, "Be reformed." The verb in Niphal is found
   in four other places, Leviticus 26:23; Psalm 2:10; Proverbs 29:19;
   Jeremiah 31:18, and rendered reformed, instructed, corrected, and
   chastised. It is the same as to receive correction and to become
   reformed. -- Ed.

   [169] Or, "Lest forced shall be my soul from thee." The verb means to
   drive, to thrust, to force. To "depart," as rendered by the ancient
   versions, and by our version, is too weak, and is not the idea; and
   still worse is "alienated," as rendered by Blayney. It intimates God's
   unwillingness, as it were, to give up his chosen people, according to
   what Calvin observes. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 6:9

   9. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, They shall throughly glean the remnant
   of Israel as a vine: turn back thine hand as a grapegatherer into the
   baskets.

   9. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Racemando racemabunt quasi vitem
   reliquias Israel; reduc (vel, redire fac) manum tuam quasi vindemiator
   ad canistra (alii vertunt, ad ramos.)


   God here confirms the former statement, as though he had said, that he
   dreaded a sight so sad and mournful, which yet the Jews disregarded. He
   then shews, that he did not in vain exhort the Jews, even though late,
   to repent, for he foresaw how dreadful would be their calamities. Hence
   he says, Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, Gleaning they shall glean; for
   the word here does not mean to gather the vintage, but to glean,
   grapiller, after the vintage. As after the harvest the poor follow and
   gather ears of corn here and there, until nothing remains in the field;
   so also in vintages when there is a gleaning, nothing remains. Hence
   God in the law forbade the vineyards to be gleaned, that there might be
   something left for the poor. (Leviticus 19:10; Deuteronomy 24:21.) But
   he says here, "Gleaning they shall glean as a vine;" he speaks not of
   the people but of the remnant.

   The ten tribes had been plundered, and at length their whole country
   had been laid waste, most of them had been led into exile, but a few
   had sought hiding -- places for a time: and he says that they were like
   gleanings: "though, "he says, "there be a few grapes, yet these shall
   follow." In short, the Prophet sets before the Jews that vengeance of
   God, which was known already to them as much as to the Israelites, the
   ten tribes: and yet he shews that God's vengeance was not completed,
   for there were still a few remaining, a gleaning: "What then shall come
   of you? What indeed! ye have seen that your brethren have been
   plundered, ye have seen that they and their children have been slain;
   ye have seen that all kinds of cruelty have been exercised towards
   them; and yet after the name of Israel has been obliterated, and their
   country now deserted, has become a waste, God will still punish the
   remnant, and ye shall see that his judgment will shortly overtake them;
   and what do ye, wretched beings, yet look for? and how great is your
   torpidity, which never comes to an end? why do you not seek to be
   reconciled to God, when such an opportunity is offered to you?"

   We now then apprehend the Prophet's object. And then he says, Return
   thy hand as a vintager to the baskets; that is, "Behold the vintagers,
   they stimulate one another; so that there is no end of gleaning, as
   they ever return to their baskets, until they gather everything, until
   there remains not a grape on the vine." [170]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [170] Blayney's version is, -- Turn again thine hand, like a
   grape-gatherer, unto the baskets. "That is, Take thou again into thine
   hand, and begin the work of gathering or gleaning anew." He takes it as
   God's address to the Chaldeans, in which they are exhorted repeatedly
   to return and to carry away captives the remaining inhabitants. But
   this does not comport with the simile of the vintager returning the
   hand to the baskets. It seems to be a command to put in safe custody
   those whom they took or gleaned, as a vintager, who, when he plucks a
   grape or a cluster, puts it safely in a basket to be carried away. The
   "hand" is put here for what the hand holds-the grapes or clusters. It
   is then the same as though he had said, "Lay up, as a vintager, what
   you glean, in baskets." The Jews were gathered, not to be destroyed,
   but to be carried away into captivity. This seems to have been the
   intimation here, -- Return thine hand, like a vintager, unto the
   baskets. That is, Throw not away what you gather, but let the hand,
   that is stretched forth to reach the grapes, bring back what it gleans
   into the baskets. The Vulgate is, "Turn (converte) thine hand as a
   vintager to his basket." The Septuagint. "Turn ye (epistrepsate) as a
   vintager to his basket." The Syriac is the same with the Vulgate,
   except that it has "gleaning" instead of "basket." The Arabic
   corresponds with the Septuagint. The Targum has an unintelligible
   paraphrase. -- Ed

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou kindly invitest us to repentance,
   and urgest us also by setting before us examples of thy wrath, -- O
   grant, that we may not continue perversely disobedient, but render
   ourselves tractable and submissive to thee, so that we may not meet
   with that dreadful severity which thou didst threaten to thine ancient
   people, but anticipate the wrath which thou didst formerly denounce on
   them; and may we thus with a pious heart return to thee, that we may
   find by experience that thou art ever a propitious Father to sinners,
   whenever with a sincere heart and without dissimulation they return to
   thee, through Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   LECTURE TWENTY-FOURTH
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:10

   10. To whom shall I speak, and give warning, that they may hear?
   behold, their ear is uncircumcised, and they cannot hearken: behold,
   the word of the Lord is unto them a reproach; they have no delight in
   it.

   10. Ad quem loquar? et quem contestabor ut audiant? Ecce incircumcisa
   auris eorum, et non poterunt attendere; ecce verbum Jehovae fuit illis
   opprobrio? non acquieverunt in eo (hoc est, non oblectati sunt; phphch
   significat capere oblectationem, Ils n'y ont prins nul plaisir.)


   The Prophet here shews there was no reason for him to labor any longer
   in trying to reform the people, for he spoke to the deaf. He had said
   before, according to our lecture yesterday, that God was still ready to
   be reconciled to the Jews, if they repented; but now, referring to
   himself, he says that his words were wholly lost. Hence he asks a
   question as respecting a thing strange or unexpected. To whom, he says,
   shall I speak? and to whom shall I protest? He had indeed, as we found
   yesterday, exhorted the people to repent: but there is nothing
   inconsistent in all this; for he wished, as far as he could, to secure,
   the safety of the people. Even God had commanded this; and it was his
   will, as it was yesterday stated, that a testimony should be borne,
   that it was not his fault, according to what had been taught, that he
   was not reconciled to the people.

   We now then see that the whole passage harmonizes; for Jeremiah
   performed his office in trying to find out whether the people were
   healable; but when he saw that such were their obstinacy that it
   allowed of no remedy, he exclaims as one astonished, To whom shall I
   speak? and to whom shall I protest? The meaning is, that the people
   were so given up to impiety, that the prophets spent their labor in
   vain while endeavoring to reform them. And the first clause he confirms
   by another, To whom shall I protest? He intimates that they had
   despised not only what had been plainly taught them, but also
   protestations, which possess much greater power. He means that their
   wickedness could be cured by no remedies, that they had not only
   rejected plain truth and serious warnings, but had also perversely
   resisted solemn protestations.

   That they may hear, he says. He intimates, that though he had
   faithfully performed his office, yet his labor was without any fruit,
   for all the Jews were deaf. Hence he adds, Behold, uncircumcised is
   their ear This metaphor is common in the prophets. The uncircumcised
   ear is that which rejects all true doctrine. An uncircumcised heart is
   that which is perverse and rebellious. But we ought to understand the
   reason of this: as circumcision was an evidence of obedience, so the
   Scripture calls those uncircumcised who are unteachable, who cast away
   every fear of God and all sense of religion, and follow their own lusts
   and desires. But to be thus called was greatly disliked by the Jews;
   for circumcision gave them no common ground of confidence, since it was
   the symbol and pledge of adoption, and since they knew that they were
   thereby separated from other nations so as to be called God's holy
   people. But the Prophet divested them of this vain conceit by calling
   them uncircumcised in heart and ears, for they had dealt perfidiously
   with God when they promised to be obedient to his will.

   The external sign was of itself nothing, when the end was disregarded.
   It was God's will to consecrate his ancient people to himself by
   circumcision: but when they became satisfied with the visible sign
   only, there was no longer the reality, and God's covenant was profaned.
   It is the same at this day with respect to baptism; they who wish to be
   deemed Christians, boast of it, while at the same time they shew no
   fear of God, and while their whole life obliterates the true character
   of baptism. It is hence evident, that they are sacrilegious, for they
   pollute what is holy. And for this reason Paul calls the letter [the
   outward rite] of circumcision, a sign without the reality. (Romans
   2:27.) So at this day baptism may be called the letter in all the
   profane, who have no regard to its design: for God receives us into his
   Church on the condition that we are the members of Christ, and that
   being ruled by his Spirit we renounce the lusts of our flesh. But when
   we seek under the cloak of baptism to associate God with the Devil, it
   is a most detestable sacrilege. Such was the stupid presumption of the
   Jews. This was the reason why the prophets so often charged them with
   being uncircumcised in hearts and ears: "Ye are God's holy people; give
   a proof of this: ye indeed boast that you have been circumcised;
   surely, the cutting off of a small pellicle does not satisfy God; shew
   that your hearts and ears have been circumcised: but uncircumcision
   remains in your hearts, and it remains in your ears; ye are then
   heathens."

   We now then see the meaning of the Prophet, and also the reason why
   Scripture speaks so much of the uncircumcision of the hearts and ears,
   and it was this, -- to prove the Jews guilty of profaning that sign,
   which ought to have been a pledge of their adoption, and to have served
   as a profession of a new life.

   It was not to lessen their guilt that Jeremiah said, They could not
   attend or give ear. If any one objects and asks, "Ought it to be deemed
   a crime that they could not attend?" The Prophet, as I have said, did
   not extenuate their guilt, but on the contrary shewed that they were so
   sunk in their vices, that they were not masters of themselves; as the
   case is with a drunkard, who is not in his right mind; but as he has
   contracted this vice of intemperance, his going astray or his ignorance
   is in no way excusable. So also the Prophet says, that the Jews could
   not attend to the word of the Lord, because they had surrendered
   themselves up to the Devil, so that they were become his slaves; as
   Paul says of those who were without the grace of God, that they were
   sold under sin, (Romans 7:14;) and the Scripture says elsewhere the
   same.

   In short, Jeremiah here teaches us, that such was the habit of sinning
   contracted by the Jews, that they were no longer free to do what was
   right; for the Devil led them here and there at his pleasure, as though
   they were bound in his chains. And thus he sets forth their depravity
   as hopeless. Even Aristotle, though he is of no authority as to the
   power of the will, for he holds free-will, (he knew nothing of original
   sin and of the corruption of nature,) yet allows that those who are
   otherwise wholly free cannot do what is right, when they become so
   hardened in their vices, that intemperance, akrateia, rules in them:
   for intemperance is a tyrant, which so subdues all the feelings and
   senses of men, that all liberty is destroyed. We now then see what the
   Prophet had in view: he meant not that the Jews sinned, because they
   had not the power to resist; but because they had so plunged themselves
   into the abyss of wickedness, that they had sold themselves as it were
   to the Devil, who held them fast bound, and furiously drove them along
   as he pleased.

   And this we learn more fully from what follows; for he says, Behold,
   the word of Jehovah has been to them a reproach; and it has not pleased
   them, or they have not delighted in it; for chphphmeans to take delight
   in a thing. The Prophet now more clearly shews, that the fault was in
   the Jews themselves, because they had despised God. Whence then was the
   impotence of which he had spoken? Even from their licentiousness,
   because they deemed God and his prophets as nothing. Since, then, their
   minds were thus hardened so as impiously to despise the truth, it
   followed that they could not hear and attend, inasmuch as they were
   deprived of all right knowledge. Whence was this? Even because they had
   closed their eyes and deafened their ears, and given themselves up
   altogether to the Devil, so that he led them into every kind of
   madness. In short, he shews at the end of the verse what was the
   beginning of all their evils, even because the word of God did not
   please them, that is, because they had cast aside every care for true
   religion, because they were not pleased when the prophets came and
   offered to them the favor of God. As then the truth had become unsavory
   to them, so that they rejected it, when it ought to have been
   especially delightful to them, so it happened that they became wholly
   stupid and void of all judgment and reason; and hence also came the
   uncircumcision of the ears of which mention has been made. [171] It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [171] This is a remarkable verse, and shews, as Calvin explains, the
   degraded and corrupt state of the nation in a very striking manner, --
   To whom shall I speak, And protest, so that they will hear? Behold,
   uncircumcised is their ear, So that they cannot hearken; Behold, the
   word of Jehovah Has become to them a reproach, They delight not in it.
   "A reproach" is to be the subject of reproach: the word of God by his
   prophets was despised and treated with contempt. This was the visible
   and palpable effect, but the cause was, that they had no delight in it
   or love for it.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:11

   11. Therefore I am full of the fury of the Lord; I am weary with
   holding in: I will pour it out upon the children abroad, and upon the
   assembly of young men together: for even the husband with the wife
   shall be taken, the aged with him that is full of days.

   11. Ergo indignatione (vel, ira) Jehovae repletus sum (copula hic
   ponitur vice illativae particulae, nisi adversative resolvere libeat,
   atqui, vel, ego autem) et laboravi continendo, ad effundendum super
   parvulum in compitis (hoc est, in publico, foris,) et super consilium
   juvenum ( vchvrymsunt proprie electi, nam vchr est eligere; sed ita
   vocantur juvenes, qui sunt in flore aetatis) similiter: quoniam etiam
   vir cum uxore capientur, senex cum pleno dierum.


   The prophet here rises higher; for it was not enough simply to set
   forth the truth to refractory men, but it was necessary to stimulate
   them even sharply, and sometimes to wound them, for they could not
   otherwise be roused, so great was their hardness. Hence the Prophet
   proceeds in the same strain with what we observed yesterday; and he
   declares that he was full of the indignation of God. This may be taken
   passively and actively, -- that the Prophet was indignant with holy
   zeal, because he undertook the cause of God, -- or, that he dreaded the
   judgment, which the Jews nevertheless in no way heeded. But he speaks
   here no doubt according to the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, as
   though he said, that he did not announce what his own mind suggested,
   but what was dictated by the Spirit of God. This indignation is, in
   short, to be applied to what was taught, as though he had said, "If I
   address you with great vehemence, think not that as a man I forget
   moderation, being influenced by wrath; but the Spirit of God leads and
   impels me. Whatever indignation then is found in my language, whatever
   vehemence and sharpness and menacing, all this is from God's Spirit,
   and not from my own feelings as a man." It was on this account that he
   says, that he was filled with the indignation of God.

   What follows confirms this statement; for he says, that he was wearied
   with restraint; as though he said, that so great was the impulse of
   God's wrath, that it could not be withheld from breaking out into
   vehemence. And hence we learn, as I have said, that the Prophet
   declares no other thing than that he was not moved by his own
   indignation, or by any feeling of his own nature, but that he of
   necessity followed where he was led by the hidden influence of God's
   Spirit, lest what he taught might be despised; for the Jews had long
   accustomed themselves to use their taunts and to say, that they were
   not to be frightened like children. That the Jews then might not thus
   trifle, Jeremiah declares, that he was so filled with the indignation
   of God, that he could contain himself no longer, but must denounce on
   his own kindred what God had committed to his charge. As we shall
   elsewhere see the same mode of speaking, and in more express terms, I
   shall proceed without making any farther remarks.

   He afterwards says, I shall pour it out, etc. He no doubt continues the
   same subject. He then says, that since he could no longer suppress the
   vengeance of God, whose herald he was, he would now pour it out, and
   that upon the children, he says, in the streets He doubtless means by
   these words that there was nothing pure among the people, for the very
   children were involved in the same guilt. Since, then, impiety so
   prevailed that even children in their tender age were not exempt from
   it, it was an evidence of a hopeless condition. This is what the
   Prophet means by saying, that he would pour wrath upon children. Then
   he adds, upon the assembly, etc. The word svd, sud, means a
   congregation, or an assembly; and it means also counsel. But as the
   Prophet speaks of streets, there seems to be a contrast between streets
   and counsels, as though he said, that children playing in the streets
   were without any counsel or understanding: but still I include with
   them the old and the grown up men, for they are all exposed to God's
   judgment. He then adds, the counsel of young men; for there is more
   discretion and prudence in young men grown up to maturity. The Hebrews
   do not call youths of fifteen vchvrym, bachurim, but men of full and
   mature age; and the word is derived from a verb which means to choose.
   They then who are in the flower of their age are called vchvrym,
   bachurim, because they are endued with discretion, and do not play in
   the streets like children. The Prophet then says, that God's wrath
   would now be poured forth on children, and also on men grown up to the
   age of twenty or thirty.

   For the husband, he says, with his wife shall be taken, the aged with
   the full of days Some think that the full of days was the decrepit: but
   by zqn, zaken, I understand the aged, and by the full of days, all
   those already grown into maturity, as those from fifty to eighty may be
   so called. He means, in short, that no one would be exempt from
   suffering God's vengeance, as impiety had pervaded all stations, ranks,
   and ages. [172] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [172] There are two or three points in this verse differently
   explained. The fury or indignation of Jehovah has been viewed as the
   message which the Prophet had to deliver, which strongly expressed
   God's displeasure. See Jeremiah 1:9, and Jeremiah 20:9. The verb for
   pouring forth is either in the imperative or in the infinitive mood.
   The Vulgate and the Syriac render it as an imperative; but the
   Septuagint, the Targum, and the Arabic give it, as in our version, in
   the future indicative, the first person. Venema follows the Vulgate:
   but Blayney takes it to be in the imperative mood; which seems most
   consistent with the whole of the passage. The view of most as to "the
   old" and "the full of years" is, that the first is mature old age, and
   that the second is the last stage of life, the age of decrepitude. The
   full of days is "one" as Blayney says, "who has arrived at the full
   period of human life;" and hence "Abraham, Isaac, David, and Job are
   said to have died full of years, or of days." See Isaiah 65:20. Though
   the general meaning is given in our version, yet the more literal I
   conceive to be the following, -- But with the wrath of Jehovah have I
   been filled; I am weary of restraining to pour it forth On the child in
   the street, And on the assembly of young men also; Yea, both man and
   woman shall be taken, The aged and the full of days. It is unusual to
   have two infinitives following one another: but the Welsh is capable of
   expressing the Hebrew literally, -- Blinais ymattal dywallt. Nothing
   can express the original more exactly. It is better to say "man and
   woman, "as Gataker proposes, than "husband and wife;" for the object is
   to shew, that all, including every age and both sexes, were to be
   visited with judgment. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:12

   12. And their houses shall be turned unto others, with their fields and
   wives together: for I will stretch out my hand upon the inhabitants of
   the land, saith the Lord

   12. Et volventur (quasi per circuitum, haec est propria significatio,
   vertentur) domus eorum ad alienos, agri et uxores similiter; quia
   extendam manum meam super habitatores terrae, dicit Jehova.


   One kind of vengeance only he mentions, -- that the Jews would be
   deprived of their land, which they thought would ever remain in peace
   to them. Inasmuch as it had been said,

   "This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell," (Psalm 132:14)

   they imagined that they could not be driven out of it: and they
   entertained the thought, that their dwelling in the land of Canaan was
   as certain as that of the sun and moon in the heavens. As then they
   deceived themselves by this foolish confidence, the Prophet says, that
   there would be a change, that God would transfer their houses to
   foreign nations.

   He then mentions their fields and their wives All this seemed
   incredible to the Jews: but it was necessary to denounce on them so
   dreadful a vengeance, that they might at length be awaked. And then he
   subjoins the reason why: For God will extend his hand. The Prophet here
   reprobates their obstinacy, because it made God their enemy; as though
   he had said, that there was no cause for them to think that the
   possession of the land would be undisturbed, for God was offended with
   them. Whence, indeed, did the possession of the land come to them,
   except from God's gratuitous favor? Now, if God was adverse to them,
   what hope remained for them? We now, then, see that the Prophet at the
   end of the verse mentions the cause, that the Jews might know that what
   he said of the transfer of their houses, lands, and wives to others was
   not incredible. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:13

   13. For from the least of them even unto the greatest of them every one
   is given to covetousness; and from the prophet even unto the priest
   every one dealeth falsely.

   13. Quia a parvo eorum usque ad magnum eorum omnis (vel, quilibet) con
   cupiscit cupiditatem (hoc est, cupidus est lucri, vel, addictus
   avaritiae;) et a propheta usque ad sacerdotem quilibet operatur
   mendacium (hoc est, fraudulenter agit.)


   The Prophet now again declares, that it was nothing strange that God
   resolved to deal with so much severity with that people, and to execute
   on them extreme vengeance; for no part was whole and sound, but impiety
   had pervaded all ranks. It might, indeed, be ascribed to the young, as
   well as to the old, for he says, From the small to the great; but I
   prefer to understand the first clause of the poor and the lower orders,
   and the second of the higher ranks, who excelled in power and wealth
   among the people. He says, then, that contempt of God and every kind of
   wickedness prevailed, not only in one part but in the whole community,
   so that there was no soundness from the head to the soles of the feet.
   We now, then, perceive what the Prophet means by saying, From the small
   to the great [173]

   And this appears still clearer from the end of the verse, where he
   says, From the prophet to the priest He amplifies here what he had said
   of the small and the great. Hence we see, that by the great he
   understands not those of mature or advanced age, but such as were in
   dignity and honor, who were in esteem on account of their wealth or of
   other endowments. So also, on the other hand, he does not call those
   small who were young, but such as were despised, who were of the lowest
   order, and formed as it were the dregs of society: for as I have said,
   he amplifies what he had said, by adducing the prophets and the
   priests. Even though the king and his court were extremely wicked, yet
   some care for religion ought to have prevailed among the prophets and
   the priests; there ought at least to have been among them some decency;
   for they were appointed for the purpose of carrying light for others.
   As, then, even these were apostates, and had degenerated from the true
   worship of God, what could have been found among the rest of the
   people?

   We now, then, see that the mouth of the ungodly was here closed, so
   that they could not expostulate with God or blame his severity, for
   they had all arrived at the highest pitch of impiety, inasmuch as the
   prophets and the priests were no less corrupt than the common people.

   By saying that all coveted covetousness, he refers to frauds and base
   gain; in that he includes every kind of avariciousness. [174] By saying
   that the priests and the prophets wrought falsehood, or acted
   fraudulently, he means the same thing, but in other words, even that
   there was no integrity in those teachers who ought to have been leaders
   to the blind: for God had ordained them that they might, as I have
   said, carry light to all others and shew them the way of salvation. It

   [173] "From the small of them even to the great," Septuagint; "From the
   less to the greater," Vulgate; "From the least of them even to the
   greatest of them," Targum, Syriac, and Arabic. The last is the best.
   The positive degree is often put in Hebrew for the superlative. See
   Jonah 3:5. -- Ed.

   [174] The words literally are "gaining gain," rendered in Proverbs
   1:19, and Proverbs 15:27, "greedy of gain." The Septuagint give only a
   general idea, "performed unlawful things;" the Vulgate has, "given to
   avarice;" the Targum, "gape after riches." The prevailing sin of all
   ranks was covetousness; and the special sin of the priests and prophets
   was falsehood: they taught falsely. The verse may be thus rendered, --
   For from the least of them to the greatest of them, His all is to gain;
   And from the prophet to the priest, His all is to act falsely. "His
   all" means all his object, or all that he did. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 6:14

   14. They have healed also the hurt of the daughter of my people
   slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

   14. Et sanarunt plagam filiae populi mei super levitate (hoe est, super
   nihilo, de nihilo,) dicendo, Pax, pax, et non pax.


   This is to be applied to the prophets and priests alone; they not only
   corrupted the people by their bad example, but also shook off every
   fear of God, and by their impostures and false boasting took away every
   regard and respect for the teaching of the true prophets. He then says,
   that they healed to no purpose, or with levity or slightness, [175] the
   wound of the people He says, by way of concession, that they had healed
   the wounds of the people: but it was no cure, when the evil was
   increasing. They were like the unskillful, who by rashly applying false
   remedies, cause inflammation, even when the disease is not serious; or
   like those who are only bent on easing pain, and cause the increase of
   the disease within, which is the more dangerous as it is more hidden.
   This is not to heal, but to kill. But the Prophet, as I have said,
   concedes to them the work of healing, and then states the issue, --
   that they were executioners and not physicians. They have healed, he
   says, the wound of my people: He takes the words, as it were, from
   their mouth, "Ye are verily good physicians! for by your flatteries ye
   have soothed my people: there was need not only of sharp medicine to
   stimulate and to cause pain, but also of caustics and of amputations;
   but ye have only applied lenients. This is your way of healing! ye have
   thus healed the wound of my people, even by plasters and ointments to
   drive inward the disease; but what has been the effect?"

   He then immediately shews what sort of healing it was: It was saying,
   Peace, peace The evil we know is an old one, common almost to all ages;
   and no wonder, for no one wishes otherwise than to please himself; and
   what we observe daily as to the ailments of the body, is the same as to
   the diseases of the soul. No sick person willingly submits to the
   advice of his physician, if he prohibits the use of those things which
   he desires: "What am I then to do? it were better to die than to follow
   this advice." And then, if the physician bids him to take a bitter
   dose, he will say, "I would rather a hundred times endure any pain than
   to drink that draught." And when it comes to bleeding and other more
   painful operations, as caustics and things of this kind, O the sick man
   can stand it no longer, and wishes almost any evil to his physicians.
   What then experience proves to be true as to bodily diseases, is also
   true, as I have said, as to the vices of the mind. All wish to deceive
   themselves; and thus it happens that they wish for such prophets as
   promise them large vintages and an abundant harvest, according to what
   is said by the Prophet Micah:

   "Behold," says God, "ye wish to have prophets who will speak to you of
   rich provisions and of every kind of affluence; and ye do not wish them
   to prophesy evil; ye would not have them to denounce on you the
   punishment which you fully deserve." (Micah 2:11)

   As, then, the despisers of God wished to be soothed by flatteries, and
   reject the best and the most salutary remedies, hence God has from the
   beginning given loose reins to Satan, and hence impostors have gone
   forth, whose preaching has been, Peace, peace; but to no purpose; for
   there is nothing real in such healing, for the Lord says, there is no
   peace

   The bolder any one is who professes to heal, if he be unskillful, the
   more disastrous will be the issue. Hence the Prophet shews that the
   cause of the extreme calamity of the Jews was, because they were
   deceived by their own priests and teachers. He does not at the same
   time, as it has been elsewhere observed, excuse them, as though the
   whole blame belonged to their false teachers. For how was it that the
   false prophets thus fascinated them? Even because they knowingly and
   willfully destroyed themselves; for they would not receive honest and
   skillful physicians: it was therefore necessary to give them up to such
   as killed them. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [175] The words l nqlh -- "with what is worthless," or base, or
   contemptible, are rendered, "exouthenountes -- regarding as nothing,"
   or despising, by the Septuagint; "cum ignominia -- with reproach" or
   contempt, by the Vulgate and Arabic; "illusione -- by illusion," by the
   Syriac; and "with false words," by the Targum. The same phrase occurs
   in Jeremiah 8:11. The whole verse is there omitted by the Septuagint;
   the Vulgate has "ad ignominiam -- to reproach;" the Arabic, "in jocos
   -- for sport; the Syriac, "nugis -- with trifles;" but the Targum is
   the same as here. None give the same version but the last. In the
   Complutensian Edition, which has this verse in Jeremiah 8:11, the Greek
   version is evidently a version of the Vulgate. The idea of "slightly,"
   or "superficially," as rendered by Blayney, is not countenanced by any
   of the foregoing versions, nor can the original words bear this
   meaning. The word nqlh, is found as a Niphal participle, and applied to
   man, as a despised, contemptible, or worthless being, -- 1 Samuel
   18:23; Proverbs 12:9; Isaiah 3:5; Isaiah 16:14. But here it refers to
   the means used for healing, which, according to all the versions, was
   something contemptible, worthless, useless, and which is afterwards
   named, being no more than saying, Peace, peace, when in fact there was
   no peace. And healed have they the bruise Of the daughter of my people
   with what is worthless, Saying, "Peace, peace;" and there was no peace.
   -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 6:15

   15. Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they
   were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore they shall
   fall among them that fall: at the time that I visit them they shall be
   cast down, saith the Lord

   15. An confusi sunt (vel, an puduit eos,) quia abominationem patrarunt?
   etiam non puduit eos (hoc est, nihil prorsus in ipsis fuit pudoris)
   etiam erubescere nescierunt: propterea cadent inter cadentes, in
   tempore visitationis eorum ruent, inquit Jehova.


   Jeremiah turns now his discourse to the whole people. In the last verse
   he reproved only the priests and the prophets; he now speaks more
   generally, and says, that they had put off all shame. "Behold," he
   says, "they are sufficiently proved guilty, their wickedness is
   manifest, and yet there is no shame. Their disgrace is visible to
   heaven and earth; angels and all mortals are witnesses of their
   corruption; but they have such a meretricious front that they are
   touched by no sense of shame." He means, in these words, that the
   wickedness of the people was past all remedy; for they had arrived to
   that degree of stupor, of which Paul speaks, when he calls those
   apelgekotas, who were obstinate in their vices, who saw no difference
   between right and wrong, between white and black. (Ephesians 4:19.)

   This, then, is what the Prophet means when he says, Have they been
   ashamed? But a question is much more emphatical, than if it was a
   simple reprobation or affirmation. They have not been even ashamed, he
   says. In their very shame, they knew not what it was to be touched by
   any shamefacedness. This may be classed with those reproofs, by which
   they had not been subdued; as though he had said, "Efforts having been
   made to expose their effrontery, in not humbling themselves under the
   hand of God; they shall therefore fall among the fallen;" that is, "I
   will dispute no longer with them, nor contend in words, but will
   execute on them my judgment." Fall, then, shall they among the fallen;
   as though he had said, "I have more than sufficiently denounced war on
   them: had they been healable it would have availed to their conversion,
   that they had been so often warned; and still more, that I have so
   sharply stimulated them to come to me: but I will now no more employ
   words, on the contrary, I will execute my vengeance, so that the
   calamity which they have derived may devour them." [176]

   They shall wholly fall, he says, in the day of their visitation From
   this second clause we understand more clearly what it is or what he
   means when he speaks of falling among the fallen, which is, that they
   should wholly fall, when God would come as it were with a drawn sword
   to destroy them, having been wearied with giving them so many warnings.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [176] The Syriac is the only version that puts the first verb in an
   interrogatory form. "They have been confounded," is the Septuagint and
   Vulgate; and similar is the rendering of the Arabic and the Targum. The
   verb, taken literally, it being in Huphal, may be rendered, "They have
   been put to shame," or have been made to be ashamed; that is, they had
   been exposed to shame; but this shame they felt not, according to what
   follows. Their previous evils were enough to make them feel ashamed;
   but they had not that effect: hence entire ruin is denounced on them at
   the end of the verse. The rendering of the whole is as follows, -- 15.
   Exposed to shame have they been, Because abomination have they wrought:
   Neither with shame are they ashamed, Nor how to be abashed do they
   know; Therefore fall shall they with the fallen; At the time when I
   shall visit them, They shall perish, saith Jehovah. There is no
   necessity to make this verse and the 12th of chap. 8 (Jeremiah 8:12)
   the same in every particular, as Blayney attempts to do. Both passages
   are the same in meaning, with a little variety in some of the words.
   The particle gm, repeated, may be rendered by, either and nor. See
   Numbers 23:5. The verb hklymis an infinitive Huphal. It is rendered as
   an infinitive by the Vulgate. "They shall perish," which is according
   to the Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Arabic, is literally, "They
   shall be made to stumble." -- Ed

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that inasmuch as thou seekest daily to restore us
   to thyself, and so arrangest thy word, as now kindly to allure us, and
   then to reprove us severely, and even to drive us by threatenings, -- O
   grant, that we may not be altogether unteachable; but so rule us by the
   spirit of meekness, that we may submit ourselves to thee and to thy
   holy word, and be so terrified by the fear of thy judgment as yet ever
   to taste of the sweetness of thy mercy, so that we may cleave to thee
   in Christ thy Son, until we shall at length fully know that thou art
   our Father, and enjoy the fruit of our adoption in the same Christ
   Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 6:16

   16. Thus saith the LORD, Stand ye in the ways, and see, and ask for the
   old paths, where is the good way, and walk therein, and ye shall find
   rest for your souls. But they said, We will not walk therein

   16. Sic dicit Jehova, State super vias, et videte, et inquirite de
   semitis seculi (hoc est, antiquis) quaenam via sit recta; et ambulate
   in ea, ut inveniatis requiem animae vestrae: et dixerunt, Non ibimus
   (vel, non ambulabimus.)


   The Prophet teaches us here that the fault of the people could not be
   extenuated as though they had sinned through ignorance; for they had
   been warned more than necessary by God. The same sentiment is found in
   Isaiah,

   "This is your rest; but they would not hear." (Isaiah 28:12.)

   But our Prophet more at large condemns the Jews; for God had commanded
   them to stand in the ways, to look and to inquire respecting all the
   old paths. He uses a similitude: and we ought not to doubt respecting
   the way, since it has been shewn to us by the mouth of God. But the
   impiety of the people is exposed and reproved, because they did not so
   much as open their eyes, when God shewed them the way and allowed them
   a free choice: for he introduces God here, not strictly as one who
   commands, but as one who shews so much indulgence, that the people were
   free to choose the way they approved and thought best. When God deals
   so kindly with men, and so condescendingly sets before them what is
   useful and expedient, it is the basest ingratitude to reject such
   kindness on God's part.

   We now then understand the Prophet's design in saying, that God had
   commanded them to stand in the ways and to consider what was best to be
   done. Consider, he says, and ye shall find rest, that is, that ye may
   find rest (for the copulative here denotes the end) to your souls [177]
   Here the Prophet means, that it remained only with the Jews to secure
   prosperity and a quiet state; for if they had obeyed the counsel of
   God, rest would have been provided for them: in short, he means, that
   they were miserable through their own willfulness; for God had set
   before them the prospect of a happy condition, but this favor had been
   despised by them, and wantonly despised, as these words intimate, And
   they said, We will not walk in it

   We see that the people's perverseness is here discovered; because they
   might have otherwise objected and said, that they had been deceived,
   and that if they had been in time warned, they would have obeyed good
   and wise counsels. In order to cut off this handle, Jeremiah says, that
   they from deliberate wickedness had rejected the rest offered them by
   God: they have said, We will not walk in it. This resolution deafly
   shews that they obstinately remained in their sins; so that the rest,
   which was within their reach, was not chosen by them.

   This passage contains a valuable truth, -- that faith ever brings us
   peace with God, and that not only because it leads us to acquiesce in
   God's mercy, and thus, as Paul teaches us, (Romans 5:1,) produces this
   as its perpetual fruit; but because the will of God alone is sufficient
   to appease our minds. Whosoever then embraces from the heart the truth
   as coming from God, is at peace; for God never suffers his own people
   to fluctuate while they recumb on him, but shews to them how great
   stability belongs to his truth. If it was so under the Law and the
   Prophets, as we have seen from Isaiah, how much more shall we obtain
   rest under Christ, provided we submit, to his word; for he has himself
   promised it, "Come unto me all ye who labor and are heavy laden, and I
   will refresh you." And ye shall find rest, he says here, to your souls.
   This passage then serves to commend this celestial truth, that it
   avails to pacify consciences, so that there is no perplexity nor doubt.
   It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [177] Blayney renders the word for "rest," mrgv, "restoration;" but his
   long note is not satisfactory. It is rendered, strangely enough, by the
   Septuagint, "purification -- hagnismon;" but by the Vulgate,
   "refreshment -- refrigerium;" and by the Syriac and Targum, "rest --
   requiem;" which seems to be its meaning, especially here, as it stands
   in contrast with the false peace promised by the false prophets. The
   representation is that of travelers, who, when doubtful as to the right
   road, are to stand, that is, to stop, to look, and also to inquire.
   There were several old paths before them, but they were to inquire
   which was the good way, and to walk in it. This was what Jehovah by his
   prophets had exhorted the people to do, who had false prophets among
   them; but they refused to do so. It is a relation of what God had done,
   -- Thus has Jehovah said, -- "Stand ye by the ways and look, And ask,
   as to the paths of old, Where that is, the good way; And walk ye in it,
   And ye shall find rest to your souls:" But they said, "We will not walk
   in it." There were many paths of old, or of antiquity, as there are
   still; but there was one good way, the way of God's word. That the way
   is old is no proof that it is good. Error's ways are as old as the way
   of truth. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 6:17

   17. Also I set watchmen over you, saying, Hearken to the sound of the
   trumpet. But they said, We will not hearken.

   17. Et constitui super eos speculatores, ut attenderent [178] ad vocem
   (hoc est, clangorem) tubae: et dixerunt, Non attendemus.


   This is an explanation of the last verse, yet not simply so; for the
   Prophet by a similitude aggravates the obstinacy of the people, who
   were not only deaf to the Prophet's admonitions, but would not be
   roused by the sound of the trumpet, nor even attend to it. The sound of
   the trumpet ought to have penetrated into their minds more than
   anything else for two reasons, -- because it was louder than any voice
   of man, -- and also, because we do not usually hear the trumpet
   sounding, except when war is at hand, or when there is the fear of war.

   We hence see why the Prophet, after having announced his message,
   mentions the sound of the trumpet; as though he had said, that not only
   the prophets were despised, while teaching the people, but that the
   sound of the trumpet, announcing the approach of war, was not attended
   to by them. The stupidity of the people, and not only their stupidity,
   but as I have said, their perverseness also, was more fully proved,
   than if the Prophet had simply said, that they had resolved not to
   hear. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [178] There are several MSS. which have v before this verb, and such no
   doubt was the copy of Calvin. But all the versions render the verb as
   an imperative, as no doubt it is -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:18-19

   18. Therefore hear, ye nations, and know, O congregation, what is among
   them.

   18. Propterea audite gentes, et cognosce coetus quid in ipsis futurum
   sit.

   19. Hear, O earth: behold, I will bring evil upon this people, even the
   fruit of their thoughts, because they have not hearkened unto my words,
   nor to my law, but rejected it.

   19. Audi, terra, Ecce ego adduco malum (hoc est, cladem) super populum
   hunc, fructum cogitationum ipsorum, qui ad verba mea non fuerunt
   attenti, et legem meam spreverunt (ad verbum, et legem meam spreverunt
   in ipsa; sed non est ambiguus sensus, quod scilicet vel abjecerint vel
   spreverint, vel pro nihilo duxerint; verbum hoc significat rejicere et
   spernere, significat etiam reprobare; jam semel hoc usus est Propheta
   et saepius utetur.)


   He turns now to address the nations, which had never heard anything of
   true religion. But the design of the apostrophe was, to make the Jews
   ashamed of their insensibility and deafness, for more attention and
   understanding were found among heathen nations. This was surely very
   great shame: the Jews had been plainly taught by the Law and by the
   Prophets, God had continued morning and evening to repeat the same
   things to them, that the nations, who had never heard the prophets and
   to whom the Law had not been given, should still be endued with more
   understanding and judgment than the Jews -- this was very shameful and
   really monstrous. Thus the Prophet's design was to expose their
   disgraceful conduct by addressing the nations, and saying, Hear, ye
   nations

   Then he says, Know, thou assembly The words used are dy, doi, and dh,
   ode; and though the letters are inverted, there is yet an alliteration
   by no means ungraceful. With regard to the meaning, the Prophet shews
   that he found no disciples among the elect people, for they were like
   brute beasts or stones or trunks; he therefore turned to address the
   nations, as he despaired of any fruit to his labors among the Jews: ye
   nations, then, hear, and know, thou assembly, (the reference is to any
   people,) what shall be to them Some interpreters apply this to their
   vices, and give this version, "What their state is, "or, "What
   atrocious vices prevail and reign among them." But I prefer to apply it
   to their punishment, though I do not contend for this view, as there is
   a probability in favor of the other. But the Prophet seems here to send
   for the nations, that they might be witnesses of the just vengeance of
   God, because the people's impiety had become irreclaimable. "Hear then
   what shall be done to them." He had threatened the Jews as he had done
   before, and as he will often do hereafter; but his design in this place
   was to reproach them for being so intractable; for he expected that his
   labors would produce more fruit among the nations than among them.
   [179]

   He then adds, Hear, thou earth This is general, as though he said,
   "Hear ye, all the inhabitants of the earth: "Behold, I am bringing an
   evil on this people He would have directly addressed the Jews, had they
   ears to hear; but as their vices and contempt of God had made them
   deaf, it was necessary for him to address the earth. Now, God testifies
   here that he should not act cruelly in visiting with severity this
   people, as he would only reward them as they deserved. The sum of what
   is said then is, that however grievous might be the punishment he would
   inflict, yet the people could not complain of immoderate rigor, for
   they should only receive what their works justly deserved. But Jeremiah
   not only speaks of their works, but he mentions the fruit of their
   thoughts; for they concocted their wickedness within, so that they did
   not offend God through levity or ignorance. By thoughts, then, he means
   that daily meditation on evil, to which the Jews had habituated
   themselves. So then their interior wickedness and obstinacy are here
   set forth.

   He afterwards adds, Because they have not to my words attended, and for
   nothing have they esteemed my law. We ever see that the guilt of the
   Jews was increased by the circumstance, that God had exhorted them by
   his servants, and that they had rejected all instruction. That they
   then would not hearken, and that they counted the law and instruction
   as nothing, made it evident that their sin could not by any pretense be
   excused; for they knowingly and openly carried on war with God himself,
   according to what is said of the giants.

   We may learn from this passage, that nothing is more abominable in the
   sight of God than the contempt of divine truth; for his majesty, which
   shines forth in his word, is thereby trampled under foot; and further,
   it is art extreme ingratitude in men, when God himself invites them to
   salvation, willfully to seek their own ruin and to reject his favor. It
   is no wonder then that God cannot endure the contempt of his word; by
   which his majesty, as I have said, is dishonored, and his goodness, by
   which he would secure the salvation of men, is treated with the basest
   ingratitude. He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [179] The version of the Septuagint is wholly inconsistent with the
   drift of the passage. The other ancient versions are materially
   according to our version. Several MSS. read vdvfor vdy; and this
   renders the meaning much better. Then dhis "testimony" as well as
   "assembly," which appears here very much without meaning. The two
   verses would then be as follows, -- 18. Therefore hear, ye nations, And
   know the testimony which is against them; 19. Yea, hear thou earth, --
   Behold, I am bringing an evil on this people, The fruit of their own
   devices, Because to my words they have not hearkened; And my law, they
   have ever rejected it. The preposition v is found after the verb, to
   testify, and is even rendered to or against; and coming after the
   substantive, testimony, it ought to be rendered the same. -- Ed
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:20

   20. To what purpose cometh there to me incense from Sheba, and the
   sweet cane from a far country? your burnt offerings are not acceptable,
   nor your sacrifices sweet unto me.

   20. Ad quid hoc mihi thus e Sabeis venit, et calamus bonus e terra
   longinqua? holocausta vestra non sunt ad beneplacitum (hoc est, non
   placent, neqne grata sunt,) et sacrificia vestra non sunt suavia (aut,
   jucunda) mihi.


   The Prophet here replies to those hypocrites, who thought that they
   made an expiation when they had offered incense and sacrifices, as
   though that was all that was necessary in serving God: and hence we
   shall hereafter see, that the Temple had become the den of thieves; for
   when they sedulously offered incense every day and performed other
   ceremonies, they thought that God was pacified. Thus hypocrites ever
   mock God with their fopperies and regard God as extremely cruel, when
   not satisfied with external display. This was a perpetual evil, with
   which the prophets had to contend: and hence the notion is often found
   referred to by our Prophet,

   "I desired not sacrifices; I commanded not your fathers, when I
   stretched forth my hand to bring them out of Egypt, to offer burnt --
   offerings to me, but only to obey my voice,"
   (Jeremiah 7:21, 22)

   So we find in other prophets: the Psalmist says,

   "If I hunger, I will not tell thee," (Psalm 50:12)

   It is said also by Micah,

   "What does God require of thee, but to humble thyself before him? He
   seeks not thousands of rams nor thousands of oxen from thy herds,"
   (Micah 6:7)

   And we see at this day, that men cannot be rightly taught, except we
   carry on war against that external splendor with which they will have
   God to be satisfied. As then men deceive themselves with such trifles,
   it is necessary to shew that all those things which hypocrites obtrude
   on God, without sincerity of heart, are frivolous trumperies. This is
   the import of what is here taught.

   There is, then, no doubt but that the Jews punctually offered their
   sacrifices, and observed the legal rites. All this might have appeared
   very commendable; but God gives this answer, To what purpose does
   frankincense come to me from the Sabeans, and a sweet cane [180] (that
   is, odoriferous) from a far country? Thus the Prophet here anticipates
   hypocrites, that he might not leave them -- what they might have
   objected: for while they spent a large sum of money on their forms of
   worship, they thought that God was as it were bound to them: and where
   they also bestowed much labor, they supposed that their' toil could not
   be superfluous or useless. And under the Papacy we observe the same
   thing: when any one builds a splendid church, and adorns it with gold
   and silver and supplies it with rich furniture, and then provides a
   revenue for saying masses, he thinks that lie holds in his hands all
   the keys of the kingdom of heaven, so that he can push in even against
   the will of God. Similar is the madness of the Papists, when they
   undertake pilgrimages: when they labor and toil, they think that every
   step they take must be numbered before God, and that God would be
   unjust, were he not to approve of what is offered to him with so much
   trouble. Such was also the conceit of the Jews. As their incense,
   brought from the Sa-beans, that is, from the east, even from Persia,
   was precious, and cost a considerable sum of money, they wished that
   this should be deemed a satisfaction for all their sins; and they
   looked for the same benefit from the cane: as the most odoriferous cane
   was bought at, a high price, they expected that it would be of account
   before God, and that it would avail to compensate for their punishment.
   This is the folly which God here treats with contempt. "What are they
   to me, "he says, "your expenses? I indeed count as nothing all that ye
   spend in buying incense and sweet cane." And then he speaks of the
   Sabeans and of a far country.

   He afterwards adds, Please me do not your burnt -- offerings, and your
   sacrifices are not acceptable Under one kind Jeremiah includes the
   whole worship according to the law; and yet it had been divinely
   appointed: this is indeed true, but for another purpose. Fasting does
   not of itself displease God; but it becomes an abomination to him, when
   it is thought to be a meritorious work, or when some holiness is
   connected with it. The same is true as to sacrifices; for they who
   sought to pacify God by victims robbed Christ of his honor: it was to
   transfer the favor, which comes from Christ, to a calf or to a goat:
   and what a sacrilege was this, and how abominable? When, therefore, the
   Jews set such a high value on their sacrifices, they sought first
   childishly to trifle with God, as though these were expiations to
   pacify him; and then to offer burnt -- offerings, to slay an animal,
   for pacifying God, was to change his nature; and lastly, it was, as I
   have said, to rob Christ of his honor: for expiation is to be sought by
   no other means than through his blood, by which we are cleansed from
   every stain through the Holy Spirit, who sprinkles it on our hearts.
   But when this was attributed to sacrifices, they substituted the
   victim, or the ram, for Christ, according to what has been stated.

   Now there ought to have been in sacrifices the exercise of the duty of
   repentance: but when they became more and more hardened, and thought
   that by their ceremonies they obtained a greater license to sin, and
   that God required no more from them, as though they had settled matters
   with him, they completely neutralized the design of God: for
   sacrifices, as it has been already said, had been enjoined for this
   end, -- that they might exercise penitence.

   We now then see that this answer given by Jeremiah was not in vain, --
   that their sacrifices did not please God. There is a severer language
   used elsewhere, -- that God nauseated them, that he was wearied in
   bearing them, that he was constrained to be troubled with them, while
   they thus profaned his name. (Isaiah 1:14.) The meaning here is the
   same, -- that God never required sacrifices for their own sake, but for
   another end; and also, that all external rites are of themselves mere
   trumperies and mockeries, nay, a profanation of God's name; so that
   they could not pacify him, but, on the contrary, provoke his wrath. It
   follows --

   [180] It is rendered "cinnamon" by the Septuagint and Arabic, "a sweet
   smelling reed" by the Vulgate, and "an aromatic reed" or cane by the
   Syriac and Targum. The literal rendering of the verse is as follows, --
   20. For what purpose is this done to me? Incense, from Sheba it comes,
   And the precious reed, from a distant land: Your burnt-offerings, they
   are not acceptable, And your sacrifices, they are not pleasing to me.
   The reed or cane was dried and powdered, and formed a part of the
   incense. The latter is mentioned first, and then one of its
   ingredients. Sheba and the distant land are the same. The same order is
   to be observed in the burnt-offerings and sacrifices; the finished act
   first, and then the previous act of presenting a sacrifice. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 6:21

   21. Therefore thus saith the Lord, Behold, I will lay stumblingblocks
   before this people, and the fathers and the sons together shall fall
   upon them; the neighbour and his friend shall perish.

   21. Propterea sic dicit Jehova, Ecce pono huic populo offendicula, et
   offendent (nam sunt ab eadem radice et nomen et verbum) patres et filii
   similiter; vicinus et socius ejus peribunt.


   Here God, in plain words, declares what vengeance he would execute on
   the people. He says first, that he would lay for them stumbling blocks
   He no doubt compares the judgments which were nigh to nets or traps;
   for the Jews hoped to escape. He therefore says, that they would be
   ensnared: "Wherever ye go, "he says, "ye shall meet with those nets by
   which God will catch you: Fall, therefore, shall both fathers and sons,
   the neighbor and his friend "

   He means by these words, that however they might conspire together,
   they would yet be exposed to the same punishment. For when sons follow
   the examples of their fathers, they think themselves innocent; and also
   when any one has many associates, he thinks himself safe in his
   licentiousness. As, then, consent or society hardens the ungodly, so
   that they fear not the wrath of God, the Prophet on this account
   includes sons with their fathers, and a neighbor with his friend, as
   those who were to perish together, and without any difference. The word
   "stumbling blocks" is indeed metaphorical; but in the next verse the
   Prophet speaks without a figure, and says --

   Jeremiah 6:22-23

   22. Thus saith the Lord, Behold, a people cometh from the north
   country, and a great nation shall be raised from the sides of the
   earth.

   22. Sic dicit Jehovah, Ecce populus veniet e terra Aquilonis, et gens
   magna excitabitur e lateribus terrae:

   23. They shall lay hold on bow and spear; they are cruel, and have no
   mercy; their voice roareth like the sea; and they ride upon horses, set
   in array as men for war against thee, O daughter of Zion.

   23. Arcum et hastam (alii vertunt, clypeum) apprehendent; crudeles
   erunt et non parcent; vox eorum quasi mare tumultuabitur, et super
   equos ascendent; erunt dispositi sicuti vir ad proelium, super to,
   filia Sion.


   It was no useless repetition when the Prophet said so often that God
   said. He might have said only, "Behold, a nation shall come from the
   north;" but he premises by saying that he derived this message from
   God, and not only so, but he introduces God as the speaker, that his
   message might be more impressive. In the former verse he had also said,
   Thus saith Jehovah, and elsewhere: but he now repeats the same words,
   that the holy name of God might more powerfully rouse their minds.

   Behold, he says, a people shall come from the land of the north For
   forty years Jeremiah ceased not to proclaim war against the Jews, and
   also openly to name their enemies: we yet see that so much preaching
   was without fruit. This was dreadful indeed: but we may thus see, as it
   were in a mirror, how great is our hardness and stupor, and how great
   is our fury and madness against God. He then designates here the
   Chaldeans as a northern nation, and says that it was a great nation:
   and yet he shews, that the Chaldeans would not of themselves come; it
   shall be roused, he says. This act is to be applied to God; for though
   ambition and avarice impelled the Chaldeans to lay waste nations and
   lands far and wide, yet that war was carried on under the guidance of
   God himself: he armed and impelled the Chaldeans, and used them as the
   scourges of his wrath. We may learn this from the verb yvr, iour,
   "shall be roused;" and he says, from the sides of the earth, [181] for
   they came from a distant country. But the Prophet means, that there
   would be nothing to hinder the Chaldeans from entering Judea, and from
   destroying and putting to flight the people, and from demolishing the
   city and the temple.

   He adds other particulars, in order more fully to render the Chaldeans
   objects of dread: They shall lay hold, he says, on the bow and the
   lance They who render the last word shield, do not sufficiently attend
   to the design of the Prophet. For there is no mention here made of
   defense; but it is the same as though the Prophet had said, that they
   would come furnished with bows and spears, that they might shoot at a
   distance. The word kydvn, kidun, means a spear and a lance; [182] and
   it means also a shield: but in this place the Prophet, I doubt not,
   means a spear; as though he had said, "They will strike at a distance,
   or near at hand."

   He afterwards adds, that they would be cruel, according to what Isaiah
   says, when he speaks of the Persians and Medes,

   "They will covet neither gold nor silver," (Isaiah 13:17)

   and yet they were a rapacious people. This is indeed true; but the
   Prophet meant both these things, that as the Persians and Medes were to
   be the executioners of divine vengeance, they would come with a new
   disposition and character, despising gold and silver, and other kinds
   of spoil, and seeking only blood. And they will shew, he says, no
   mercy; and then he adds, their voice shall make an uproar, or sound,
   like the sea He touches, I have no doubt, on the stupor of the people
   in not attending to the voice of God; for the teaching of Jeremiah had
   for many years sounded in their ears: Isaiah and others had preceded
   him; but the people had continued deaf. He says now, "Ye shall
   hereafter hear other teachers; they will not warn you, nor give you
   counsel, nor be satisfied with reproofs and threatenings, but they will
   come like a tempest on the sea; their voice shall make an uproar "

   He adds, Ascend shall they on horses, [183] and be set in order as a
   man for war; that is, "Thou, Jerusalem, shalt find that thou wilt have
   to do with military men." The Prophet means, in short, that the Jews
   most foolishly trusted in their own strength, and thus heedlessly
   despised the threatenings of the prophets. But as their security was of
   this kind, he says that they would at length really find out how stupid
   they had been, for the Chaldeans would come with dreadful violence,
   prepared for war -- against whom? Against thee, he says, O daughter of
   Sion I cannot proceed further, on account of some other business.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [181] The ancient versions render it, "from the end, or ends, or
   extremities, of the earth." -- Ed.

   [182] It is rendered "a spear," or a lance, by the Septuagint, the
   Syriac, and the Arabic; but improperly "a shield" by the Vulgate and
   the Targum. It is not true that it ever means a shield. It was a short
   spear or javelin. "It is evident," says Parkhurst, "that this word
   signifies neither the larger spear nor the shield, because it is
   distinguished from both. See 1 Samuel 17:6; 41:45 [sic]; Job 39:23." --

   Jeremiah 6:24

   24. We have heard the fame thereof: our hands wax feeble: anguish hath
   taken hold of us, and pain, as of a woman in travail.

   24. Audivimus famam ejus, dissolutae sunt manus nostrae, angustia
   apprehendit nos, dolor tanquam parturientis.


   Jeremiah proceeds in the same strain; for he sets before the eyes of
   the Jews the judgment of God, and draws them, as it were against their
   will, into the middle of the scene. And this was done by the prophets,
   as it has been already said, because by plain words they could not move
   the hearts of the people on account of their contempt of God, and of
   the long obduracy in which they had settled. Hence he says, that heard
   had been the report of the enemy, and that immediately dissolved had
   their hands When the Prophet spoke, the Jews did not think that their
   enemies were so near. But the phrase is to be thus explained: "As soon
   as ye shall hear the report, your hands shall be relaxed, and lay hold
   on you shall distress."

   The similitude of a woman in travail is often found in Scripture; and
   what is to be understood in most places is sudden and unexpected pain:
   but in this place the Prophet refers rather to the violence of pain;
   though the other meaning, which I have just stated, is not to be
   excluded; for it is probable, that when he saw that the hardness and
   obstinacy of the people were so great, he adopted this similitude, in
   order to shew, that however heedlessly they despised the punishment due
   to them, it could not yet be avoided, as it would seize them suddenly
   like that of a woman in childbearing. He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:25

   25. Go not forth into the field, nor walk by the way; for the sword of
   the enemy and fear is on every side.

   25. Ne exieritis in agrum, et per iter ne ingrediamini; quia gladius
   hostis, terror undique (vel, in circuitu, msvyv.)


   He confirms the previous verse. For the Jews, as it has been said,
   regarded all threatenings as nothing: it was hence necessary that they
   should be taught, not by words only, but be constrained to fear, by
   having the scene set before their eyes, that being thus constrained
   they might at least entertain some fear on account of the nearness of
   God's vengeance. The Prophet then denounces war, and speaks as though
   they were already besieged, Go ye not forth, he says, into the field,
   etc., for the terror of the enemy and fear is on every side; [184] not
   that the Chaldeans were already laying waste Judea, or that they had
   even departed from their own country. But we have briefly explained the
   design of the Prophet: he intended thus vehemently to deal with a
   hardened and obstinate people, that they might know that he spoke
   seriously to them, and that his threatenings would not be evanescent.
   It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [184] This is addressed to the daughter of Sion: hence the verbs are in
   the singular number. There is no need for the change which Calvin, and
   also Blayney, adopt, though countenanced by the Keri, and some MSS.,
   for the same is addressed in the next verse, -- Go thou not forth to
   the field, And in the way walk not;
   For the enemy has a sword, Terror is on every side. "For the enemy,"
   etc., literally, "For sword is to the enemy." -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 6:26

   26. O daughter of my people, gird thee with sackcloth, and wallow
   thyself in ashes: make thee mourning, as for an only son, most bitter
   lamentation: for the spoiler shall suddenly come upon us.

   26. Filia populi mei, accingere sacco, voluta to in pulvere, luctum
   unigeniti fac tibi, planctum amaritudinum; quia repente veniet vastator
   super nos.


   The Prophet seems to use more words than necessary; for in a clear
   matter he appears to extend his discourse too far: but we must consider
   the design which has been mentioned; for he could not rouse the Jews
   without urging the matter on them with great vehemence. Known and
   sufficiently common is the term, "daughter of my people, "as applied to
   the whole community. Daughter of my people, he says, be thou girded
   with sackcloth, and roll thyself in the dust It is doubtful whether the
   Prophet exhorts them to repent, or whether he denounces mourning on the
   irreclaimable and the hopeless; for ashes and sackcloth are often
   mentioned, when there is no hope of conversion or of repentance.
   However, if this view be approved, I will not object, that is, that the
   Prophet still makes the trial, whether the Jews would return to a sane
   mind.

   Make thee a mourning, he says, as for an only-begotten Thus the Hebrews
   speak of the greatest and bitterest mourning: for when any one loses an
   only son, he grieves far more for his death than if he had many
   children; for when some remain, some comfort still remains; but when
   one is wholly bereaved, a greater grief, as I have said, is felt by
   parents. For this reason the Hebrews call it a mourning for an only
   son, when things are in a hopeless state. He afterwards adds, the
   mourning of bitternesses, signifying the same thing; because suddenly
   shall come upon us the waster

   If repentance be thought to be intended here, we know that sackcloth
   and ashes are, of themselves, of no account before God, but that they
   were formerly evidences of repentance when God's wrath was humbly
   deprecated; and hence the prophets often designated the thing signified
   by the sign. We must yet remember what Joel says, that hearts, and not
   garments, are to be rent. (Joel 2:13.) But the prophets assume this
   principle as granted, that we are not to deal falsely with God, but
   with sincerity. Then by sackcloth and ashes they did not understand
   false protestations, as it is said, but real manifestations of what
   they felt, when really and from the heart they sought God's mercy. But
   as the Prophet seems here to assume the character of a herald,
   denouncing war, I know not whether repentance is what is here meant. So
   then I rather understand him as saying, that nothing but extreme
   mourning remained for the Jews: and hence he says, that destroyers
   would suddenly come upon them; for they had for many years so misused
   the forbearance of God, that they thought that they could sin with
   impunity. As, then, they had long indulged this false confidence, the
   Prophet made use of this word, "suddenly," pht'm, petam He adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:27

   27. I have set thee for a tower and a fortress among my people, that
   thou mayest know and try their way.

   27. Arcem posui to in populo meo, munitionem (vel, propagnaculum) ut
   cognoscas et probes vias ipsorum (viam ipsorum.)


   The Prophet says, that he was set by God as a watchtower, which was
   also fortified, that he might observe the wickedness of the people. In
   order to gain more authority for his prophecy, he introduces God as the
   speaker. He had spoken hitherto in his own person; but now God himself
   comes forth, and says, I have made thee a citadel. Jerome renders the
   last word "probation." The verb vchn, becken, means to prove; and
   Jeremiah uses the verb in this verse, "that thou mayest prove their
   way." But as the word mvtsr, mebezar, "fortress, "follows, we cannot
   take the word here otherwise than as meaning a citadel or rampart. I
   therefore have no doubt but that a citadel for watching is what is
   meant; as though God had said, that his Prophet was like a watchtower,
   from which might be seen at one glance whatever was done far and wide:
   for we cannot see far from a plain, but they who are located high can
   see to a great distance.

   But the word fortress is also added: for it behooved Jeremiah to watch
   without fear, and not to be exposed to the threats, calumnies, or
   clamors of the people. Jeremiah intimates that two things are required
   in God's servants, even knowledge and undaunted courage; for it was not
   enough for the prophets to see clearly what was needful, except they
   were firmly prepared to discharge their office. Both these things seem
   to be included, when he says, that he was set as a watchtower, and also
   as a fortress

   Why was he thus set? That thou mayest know, he says, and prove their
   way Let us now see what was the intention of this. The Prophet no doubt
   here claims power and credit to himself, that he might not only freely
   but authoritatively reprove the people: for objections, we know, were
   ever in their mouths, that they might be at liberty to despise the
   Prophet's teaching, as though it did not proceed from God. This then
   was the reason why God here declares that Jeremiah was like a citadel,
   and that a fortified one; he was made so, that he might observe and
   know the way of the people. Hence it followed, that however obstinately
   they might defend themselves, it availed them nothing; for Jeremiah was
   endued with the highest authority, even that which was divine, in order
   to perform his office of a judge in condemning them: for it immediately
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:28

   28. They are all grievous revolters, walking with slanders: they are
   brass and iron; they are all corrupters.

   28. Omnes perversi perversorum ambulantes in obtrectatione (dicemus
   postea de hac voce;) aes (aut, chalybs, ut alii vertunt,) vel ferrum;
   omnes perditores (vel, corruptores) sunt.


   The Prophet now shews what he found the Jews to be, whose manners and
   proceedings he had been commanded to observe. Had he said this at
   first, either the fury of the people would have been kindled, or his
   judgment would have been treated with contempt: but when God shewed
   what he had known through his servant, it had more weight, and then the
   fury of the people was also repressed, when they understood that it
   would avail them nothing to fight against God.

   He says, that they were all the apostates of apostates, or the
   transgressors of transgressors. Some read sry, sari, with a s, shin,
   and render the words, "the princes of transgressors." But I adopt the
   first as the more approved reading. They who read "princes, "elicit a
   meaning from the words which appears strange, but not the true one:
   they say that they were the princes of transgressors, because the
   people were no better than their rulers, and because servants imitated
   their masters in all kinds of wickedness. But this, as all must see, is
   a strained meaning. Why then should anything be changed, since the
   sentence, as it is, has a most suitable meaning? They are then called
   the apostates of apostates, or the transgressors of transgressors, sry
   srrym, sari sarerim The Hebrews, we know, express the superlative
   degree by doubling the word, as, the heaven of heavens, the holy of
   holies, the God of gods. He then says, that they were not only wicked,
   but most wicked, who had reached the extreme point of depravity. For
   when impiety reaches its summit, then justly may men be called the
   apostates of apostates. This, I have no doubt, is what the Prophet
   means.

   He afterwards adds, that they walked in slander The same mode of
   speaking, if I mistake not, is found in Leviticus 19:16,

   "Go not," or walk not, "among thy people with slander."

   Yet this phrase may be otherwise explained, that is, that they walked
   in calumnies, or that they perverted everything. But in this place, the
   word slander, seems too feeble, as the Prophet, in my judgment, means
   more, even the audacity of the people, so that they allowed themselves
   every liberty in sinning, and thus walked in their own wickedness.

   He adds, Brass and iron [185] Many render the words, "Brass mixed with
   iron;" that is, that the noble and the vulgar were mingled together, so
   that there was a common consent among them. Of this meaning I do not
   wholly disapprove: but as it is rather refined, I know not whether it
   be well -- founded. I therefore prefer to regard this as designating
   their hardness: They were like brass and iron, for they were
   inflexible. The Prophet then after having called them transgressors who
   had alienated themselves from God, and after having said, that they
   walked in their own depravity, now adds, that they were untamable, not
   capable of any improvements; and hence he compares them to brass and
   iron.

   He at last adds, that they were all corrupters This, as I think, is to
   be referred to their habits: for thus are enemies called, who plunder
   everything, and commit all excesses. But they are corrupters here, who
   not only like thieves plunder the goods of all, but who are leaders to
   others in wickedness: so that all things were in confusion, as it is
   wont to be said, from the head to the feet. [186] He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [185] "Their impudence resembles brass, and their obstinacy may be
   compared to iron." -- Lowth.

   [186] This verse and the preceding have been amended, and for the most
   part conjecturally, by Blayney, and though with the approbation of
   Horsley, yet with no satisfactory reasons. That the Prophet was made as
   it were a fortress, appears from Jeremiah 1:18: and there is here an
   evident allusion to that, though his being made a watchtower, or a
   watchman occupying such a place, was for a different purpose. The two
   verses I thus render, -- 27. A watchtower have I given thee among my
   people, A fortress, that thou mightest know and try their way; Then we
   are told what he had found them to be, -- All of them are the apostates
   of apostates, Companions of the slanderer; Brass and iron are all of
   them, Corrupted are they. "The apostates of apostates," mean thorough,
   confirmed apostates, as "servant of servants" means the basest:
   "companions," etc., is literally, "Walkers with," etc. "All of them,"
   clearly belong to "Brass and iron," as "they" follows "corrupted." The
   ancient versions are not satisfactory, and the Targum is paraphrastic;
   but they give the general meaning. "Prover" or "examiner" is what the
   versions give for "watchtower." "Fortress" is omitted in the
   Septuagint, the Arabic, and the Targum, and is rendered "strong" by the
   Vulgate "The apostates" is left out by the Septuagint and the Arabic,
   and is rendered "princes" by the Vulgate, Syriac, and the Targum For
   "companions of the slanderer," the Septuagint and Arabic have "walking
   perversely -- skolios;" the Syriac and Targum, "walking with guile --
   cum dolo;" and the Vulgate, "walking fraudulently -- fraudulenter." The
   word rkyl, "slanderer" is found in five other places, Leviticus 19:16;
   Proverbs 11:13; 20:19; Jeremiah 9:4; Ezekiel 22:9. In the first three
   passages it is rendered in our version "a talebearer," but more
   correctly, a slanderbearer, or, as Parkhurst renders it, "a trader in
   slander." It does not mean "a sharper," as Blayney thinks. The passages
   in Proverbs are inconsistent with such an idea. There is no passage
   where it may not be rendered "a slanderer," except Ezekiel 22:9; where
   it evidently means "slander." -- Ed

   Jeremiah 6:29

   29. The bellows are burned, the lead is consumed of the fire; the
   founder melteth in vain: for the wicked are not plucked away.

   29. Exaruit (consumptum est) sufflatorium (vel, follis) ab igne;
   integrum plumbum, frustra conflavit conflator (vel, excoxit excoctor)
   quia (nam copula hic pro causali particula ponitur, quia) mali non sunt
   purgati (vel, et, tamen adversative, non sunt consumpti; uterque sensus
   non male quadrabit.)


   He says, that the bellows was consumed by the fire and without any
   advantage. The whole sentence is metaphorical. Interpreters refer it
   simply to what was taught; and hence they consider the mouth of the
   Prophet to be the bellows, by which the fire was kindled. So the
   meaning would be, -- that the Prophet was as it were burnt, through his
   incessant crying, like the bellows, which by being continually used is
   at length consumed, especially when the fire burns fiercely. They then
   suppose that the Prophet complains that his throat had dried up, like
   the bellows, which being burnt by the fire can no longer do its work.
   But what if we refer this to the punishments and judgments by which God
   had chastised his people, and yet without benefit? For so he complains
   in the first chapter of Isaiah, and in other places.

   "In vain, "he says, "have I chastised thee:"

   and Jeremiah has before said,

   "In vain have I chastised my children; they have not received
   correction." (Jeremiah 2:30)

   So also it is said by Isaiah,

   "Alas! vengeance must I take on my enemies," (Isaiah 1:24)

   but to what purpose? He afterwards adds, that it was without any
   benefit, because their wickedness was incurable.

   The first meaning, however, is not to be rejected, for it was not
   unsuitable to say, that the tongue of the Prophet was worn out with
   constant crying, that his throat was nearly dried up. But I approve
   more of what I have just stated. Let each make his own choice. If we
   consider prophetic teaching to be here intended, we may also draw
   another meaning, -- that the Prophet's mouth was consumed by God's
   terrors; for it was like burning, whenever God threatened the people
   with final destruction. The Prophet then does not without reason say,
   that his throat was burnt by fire, even the threatenings of God.

   He afterwards adds, that the lead was entire This sentence rather
   favors the view, that Jeremiah is speaking of the judgments by which
   God sought to humble the people and to lead them to repentance; for it
   cannot be suitably applied to doctrine or teaching, that the lead was
   unmixt. By lead I understand dross. Some consider it to be silver, and
   say that lead was mixed with silver, in order that the silver might
   more easily be melted. As I am not skillful in that art, I cannot say
   whether this is done or not. But the Prophet says that the lead was
   unmixt; that is, that nothing was found but dross and filth.

   He then adds, In vain has the melter melted, for evils have not been
   purged away; that is, the dross had not been removed so as to leave
   behind the pure metal. He means, in short, that there was nothing but
   dross and filth in the people, and not a particle of pure silver. It
   hence followed, that they had been as it were in vain melted. Now, this
   applies more fitly to punishment than to teaching, as all must see. I
   hence do not doubt but that the Prophet shews here, that the Jews were
   not only wicked and apostates and despisers of God, but were also so
   obstinate that God had often tried in vain to purify them. And it is a
   kind of speaking, we know, which occurs often in the prophets and
   throughout Scripture, that God is said to melt, to purge, to refine
   men, when he chastises them. But the Prophet says that there was only
   filth in that people, that lead was found, and that they were not
   melted. And hence we learn how great was their hardness: though they
   were tried by fire, they yet melted not, but continued in their
   perverseness. [187] He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [187] The true reading of the third word in this verse is m's tm,
   according to the Keri, many MSS., the Septuagint and the Vulgate; and
   tmsometimes means "consumed." Pliny says that they formerly used lead
   to separate the dross from the silver, as they use quicksilver now.
   Then the verse is to be thus rendered, -- Burnt has been the bellows by
   the fire, Consumed has been the lead;
   In vain has been the melting of the melted, For their evils have not
   been separated. They had been in the furnace, but the lead intended to
   separate the dross from the silver, was consumed, and the melting did
   not succeed, for their evils, or their vices, were not separated from
   them. Hence in the next verse they are called reprobate silver. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 6:30

   30. Reprobate silver shall men call them, because the LORD hath
   rejected them.

   30. Argentum reprobatum (contemptibile) vocarunt [188] ipsos (hoc est,
   vocabunt:) quia sprevit (vel, reprobavit) ipsos Jehova.


   Jeremiah concludes his subject by saying, -- that if the Jews had been
   cast a hundred times into the furnace, they would not be improved, as
   they would never become softened on account of their hopeless
   obstinacy. He uses the word silver, by way of concession; for they were
   not worthy of that name, and we have already seen that there was
   nothing soft or tender in them.

   But the prophets often conceded some things to hypocrites; yet not
   without some appearance of a taunt, as the case seems to be here. The
   Jews wished to be regarded as silver, and to appear as such: "Let them
   then be silver, "that is, "Let them claim the name, by boasting
   themselves as the holy seed of Abraham; but they are a reprobate
   silver;" according to what we say, Faux or faux argent; which yet is
   neither silver nor gold; but the words are used not in their strict
   meaning, and we afterwards shew that what we have so called is not
   silver. Even so does the Prophet say, "They are silver in their own
   esteem, and take pride in the title: but they are a reprobate silver."
   How so? For Jehovah has rejected them He shews that it belongs to God
   to pronounce sentence on men, and that they gain nothing by their vain
   flatteries, and by securing some esteem in the world: for God alone is
   the true judge. The Prophet then shews that the Jews were a reprobate
   silver, in order that they might know that they in vain gloried, while
   they boasted themselves to be God's people and heritage. Now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [188] The ancient versions, except the Syriac, render this in the
   imperative mood, "vocate -- call ye them." So also the Targum, and
   Blayney has adopted the same, -- Reprobate silver call ye them, For
   reprobated (or, rejected) them has Jehovah. -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 7
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 7:1-4

   1. The word that came to Jeremiah from the Lord, saying,

   1. Sermo qui datus fuit Jeremiae (qui factus fuit ad Jeremiam, qui
   datus fuit, ad verbum) a Jehova, dicendo,

   2. Stand in the gate of the Lord's house, and proclaim there this word,
   and say, Hear the word of the Lord, all ye of Judah, that enter in at
   these gates to worship the Lord

   2. Sta in porta domus Jehovae (hoc est, Templum,) et clama illic hunc
   sermonem (hoc est, vociferare hunc sermonem, vel, cum clamore prefer,)
   et dicas, Audite sermonem Jehovae cunctus Jehudah, qui ingredimini per
   has portas, ut adoretis Jehovam:

   3. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel, Amend your ways and
   your doings, and I will cause you to dwell in this place.

   3. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus Israel, Bonas facite vias vestras
   et studia vestra, et habitabo vobiscum in hoc loco;

   4. Trust ye not in lying words, saying, The temple of the Lord, The
   temple of the Lord, The temple of the Lord, are these.

   4. Ne confidatis vobis (hoc est, ne vobis fiduciam ponatis, vel,
   adjiciatis vobis fiduciam) ad verba mendacii, dicendo, Templum Jehovae,
   Templum Jehovae, Templum Jehovae sunt.


   Here the Prophet gives a short account of the sermon, in which he
   severely reproved the people, because his labor had been useless,
   though he had sharply and severely reproved them. He says then, that he
   had a command from above to stand at the gate of the Temple. This was
   indeed usually done by the prophets: but God seems to have intended
   that this reproof should be heard by all. He says further, that he was
   commanded to address the whole tribe of Judah

   It is hence probable, and what may be easily concluded, that this
   discourse was delivered on a feast -- day, when there was the usual
   assembly of the people. He could not indeed have made this address on
   other days; for then the inhabitants of the city only frequented the
   Temple. But on the feast -- days they usually came from the neighboring
   towns and from the whole country to celebrate God's rightful worship,
   which had been prescribed in the law. Since then Jeremiah addressed the
   whole tribe of Judah, we hence conclude, that he spoke not only to the
   inhabitants of the city, but also to the whole tribe, which came
   together to keep the feast -- day.

   Now the object of his sermon was, to exhort them seriously to repent,
   if they wished God to be reconciled to them. So the Prophet shews, that
   God did not regard their sacrifices and external rites, and that this
   was not the way, as they thought, of appeasing him. For after they had
   celebrated the feast, every one returned home, as though they all,
   after having made an expiation, had God propitious to them. The Prophet
   shews here, that the way of worshipping God was very different, which
   was to reform their lives.

   Make good, he says, your ways and your doings, then will I dwell in
   this place [189] This promise contains an implied contrast; for the
   Prophet intimates, that the people would not long survive, unless they
   sought in another way to pacify God. "I will dwell, "he seems to say,
   -- in this place, when your life is changed." It then follows on the
   other hand, "God will drive you into exile, except you change your
   life: in vain then do you seek a quiet and happy state through offering
   your sacrifices. God indeed esteems as nothing this external worship,
   except it be preceded by inward sincerity, unless integrity of life
   accompanies your profession." This is one thing.

   Then the Prophet comes closer to them when he says, Trust ye not in
   words of falsehood. For had not this been expressly said, the Jews
   might, according to their usual way, have found out some evasion: "Have
   we then lost all our labor in celebrating our festivals with so much
   diligence, in leaving our homes and families to present ourselves
   before God? We have spared no expense, we have brought sacrifices and
   spent our money; and is all this of no value before God?" For
   hypocrites always magnify their trumperies, as we find in the
   fifty-eighth chapter of Isaiah, where they expostulated with God, as
   though he were unkind to them, "We have from day to day sought the
   Lord." To this the Lord answered, "In vain ye seek me from day to day
   and search for my ways." Hence the Lord disregarded that diligence with
   which hypocrites sought to render him propitious without real sincerity
   of heart. It is for the same purpose that the Prophet now adds, Trust
   ye not, etc. It is an anticipation in order to prevent them from making
   their usual objection, "What then? Has the Temple been built in vain?"
   But he says, "Is not God worshipped here in vain? They are words of
   falsehood, when religious sincerity is absent."

   We hence see that external rites are here repudiated, when men seek in
   a false way to gain favor before God, and seek to redeem their sins by
   false compensations, while yet their hearts continue perverse. This
   truth might be enlarged upon, but as it often occurs in the prophets, I
   only notice it shortly. It is enough to regard the main point, -- that
   while the Jews were satisfied with the Temple, the ceremonies and the
   sacrifices, they were self -- deceivers, for their boasting was
   fallacious: "the words of falsehood" are to be taken as meaning that
   false and vain glorying in which the Jews indulged, while they sought
   to ward off God's vengeance by external rites, and at the same time
   made no effort to return into favor by ameliorating their life.

   With regard to the expressions The Temple, etc., some explain them
   thus, -- they were "words of falsehood, "when they said that they came
   to the Temple; and so the supplement is, "when they said that they
   came, "for the pronoun demonstrative is plural. [190] Hence they
   understand this of the people; not that the Jews called themselves the
   Temple of God, but that they boasted that they came to the Temple and
   there worshipped God. But I rather agree with others, who explain this
   of the three parts of the Temple. There was, we know, the court, then
   the Temple, and, lastly, the interior part, the Holy of holies, where
   was the Ark of the Covenant. The prophets often speak of the Temple
   only; but when they spoke distinctly of the form of the Temple, they
   mentioned the court, as I have said, where the people usually offered
   their sacrifices, and then the holy place, into which the priests
   entered alone; and, lastly, the secret place, which was more hidden,
   and was called the Holy of holies. It seems then that this passage of
   the Prophet is to be understood as meaning that the people said that
   the court, the Temple, and the interior part, were the Temples of God,
   as though they had a triple Temple.

   But we must observe the design of the Prophet, which interpreters have
   omitted. The Prophet then made this repetition especially, because the
   Temple was as it were a triple defense to hypocrites, like a city,
   which, when surrounded, not by one, but by three walls, is deemed
   impregnable. Since, then, the Jews exalted their Temple, consisting of
   three parts, it was the same as they set up a triple wall or a triple
   rampart against God's judgments! "We are invincible; how can enemies
   come to us? how can any calamity reach us? God dwells in the midst of
   us, and here he has his habitation, and not one and single fort, but a
   triple fort; he has his court, his Temple, and his Holy of holies." We
   now then understand why the Prophet made this repetition, and used also
   the plural number.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [189] Though the ancient versions, except the Vulgate, render the verb
   to dwell, as an Hiphil, "cause to dwell," as in our version, yet
   Blayney, as well as Calvin, follows the Vulgate, "And I will dwell with
   you in this place:" which seems more accordant with the context. Their
   boast was that God was dwelling with them, as the temple was his
   temple. Then when Shiloh, in Jeremiah 7:12, is referred to, God says
   that he set his name there: and no doubt the same thing is meant here.
   -- Ed.

   [190] The difficulty in the construction is removed by Blayney, who
   renders dvry as a participle, as it is in some other places, Psalm 5:6:
   Psalm 38:3; Psalm 63:11. His version is, -- Trust ye not in those who
   speak falsehood, saying, --
   The Temple of Jehovah, the Temple of Jehovah, The Temple of Jehovah,
   are these. The Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Arabic, have "the Temple
   of the Lord" only twice, and the verb is in the singular number, "The
   Temple of the Lord, the Temple of the Lord it is." The verb is the same
   in the Vulgate, only the words, as in Hebrew, and also in the Targum,
   are repeated thrice. The paraphrase of the latter is rather singular,
   -- "Trust not in the words of the prophets of falsehood, who say,
   Before the Temple of the Lord ye worship, before the Temple of the Lord
   ye sacrifice, before the Temple of the Lord ye offer praise; three
   times a year ye appear before him." "These" mean, as Gataker thinks,
   these places or buildings; and Lowth and Blayney think the same. The
   repetition seems to denote the frequency with which the Jews used the
   words: they continually boasted of having God's Temple among them. "The
   Prophet," says Henry, "repeats it, because they repeated it upon all
   occasions. It was the cant of the times. If they heard an awakening
   sermon, they lulled themselves asleep again with this, We cannot but do
   well, for we have the Temple of the Lord among us.' It is common for
   those that are farthest from God to boast themselves most of their
   being near to the Church." -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we so abuse thy forbearance, that thou art
   constrained by our depravity to deal sharply with us, -- O grant, that
   we may not be also hardened against thy chastisements, but may we with
   a submissive and tractable neck learn to take thy yoke, and be so
   obedient to thy government, that we may testify our repentance, not for
   one day only, and give no fallacious evidence, but that we may really
   prove through the whole course of our life the sincerity of our
   conversion to thee, by regarding this as our main object, even to
   glorify thee in Christ Jesus our Lord. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 7:5-7

   5. For if ye throughly amend your ways and your doings; if ye throughly
   execute judgment between a man and his neighbour;

   5. Certe si bonas faciendo bonas feceritis vias vestras (bonificando
   bonificaveritis, ad verbum, si ita vertere liceret) et studia vestra;
   si faciendo feceritis judicium inter virum et inter proximum ejus;

   6 If ye oppress not the stranger, the fatherless, and the widow, and
   shed not innocent blood in this place, neither walk after other gods to
   your hurt:

   6. Peregrinum, pupillum et viduam non oppresseritis; et sanguinem
   innoxium non effuderitis in hoc loco; et post deos alienos non
   ambulaveritis in malum vobis (in malum vestrum;)

   7. Then will I cause you to dwell in this place, in the land that I
   gave to your fathers, for ever and ever.

   7. Tunc habitare faciam vos in hoc loco, in terra quam dedi patribus
   vestris, a seculo usque in seculum.


   Interpreters do not agree as to the meaning of this passage. Some
   render ky 'm, ki am, "But rather, "or, "But." I indeed allow that it is
   so taken in many places; but they are mistaken who read ky 'm, ki am,
   as one word; for the Prophet, on the contrary, repeats what he had
   said, and that is, that God would not be propitious to the Jews except
   their life proved that they had really repented. The words are
   sometimes taken as one in Hebrew, and mean "but;" yet in other places
   they are often taken as separate words, as we found in the second
   chapter, "Though thou washest thyself with nitre;" and for the sake of
   emphasis the particle "surely, "is put before "though." But in this
   place the Prophet simply means, that the Jews were deceived in seeking
   to prescribe a law for God according to their own will, as it belongs
   only to him either to approve or to reject their works. And this
   meaning is confirmed by the latter part of the verse, for we read not
   there ky 'm, ki am, but 'm, am; "If by doing ye shall do judgment;" and
   then in the same form he adds, "If ye will not oppress the stranger,
   the orphan, and the widow;" and at last he adds, "Then (a copulative I
   allow is here, but it is to be taken as an adverb) I will make you to
   dwell in this place."

   The purport of the whole is, -- that sacrifices are of no importance or
   value before God, unless those who offer them wholly devote themselves
   to God with a sincere heart. The Jews sought to bind God as it were by
   their own laws: he shews that he was thus impiously put under
   restraint. He therefore lays down a condition, as though he had said,
   "it belongs to me to prescribe to you what is right. Away, then, with
   your ceremonies, by which ye think to expiate your sins; for I regard
   them not, and esteem them as nothing." What then is to be done? He now
   shews then, "If you will rightly order your life, ye shall dwell in
   this place."

   For yesterday the Prophet exhorted the people to repent; and he
   employed the sentiment which he now repeats. He commanded the people to
   come to God with an upright and pure mind; he afterwards added another
   sentence, "Trust not in words of falsehood, saying, The Temple of the
   Lord, "etc. He now again repeats what he had said, "If ye will make
   your ways good." He shews now more clearly that no wrong was done to
   the people when God repudiated their ceremonies; for he required a pure
   heart, and external rites without repentance are vain and useless. This
   then is what the Prophet had in view: "Though God seems to treat you
   with great severity, he yet promises to be kind to you, if you order
   your lives according to his law: is this unjust? Can the condition
   which is proposed to you by God be liable to any calumnies, as though
   God treated you cruelly!" This then is the meaning of the Prophet.

   If ye will make good your ways, that is, if your life be amended; and
   if ye will do judgment, etc. He now comes to particulars; and first he
   addresses the judges, whose duty it was to render to every one his
   right, to redress injuries, to pronounce what was just and right when
   any contention arose. If then, he says, ye will do justice between a
   man and his neighbor, that is, if your judgments be right, without
   favor or hatred, and if no bribes lead you from what is right and just,
   while pronouncing judgment on a case between a man and his brother.

   Then he adds, if ye will not oppress the stranger and the orphan and
   the widow This also belonged to the judges: but God no doubt shews here
   generally, that injustice greatly prevailed among the people, as he
   condemns the cruelty and perfidy of the judges themselves.

   As to strangers and orphans and widows, they are often mentioned; for
   strangers as well as orphans and widows were almost destitute of
   protection, and were subject to many wrongs, as though they were
   exposed as a prey. Hence, whenever a right government is referred to,
   God mentions strangers and orphans and widows; for it might hence be
   easily understood of what kind was the public administration of
   justice; for when others obtain their right, it is no matter of wonder,
   since they have advocates to defend their cause, and they have also the
   aid of friends. Thus every one who defends his own cause, obtains at
   least some portion of his right. But when strangers and orphans and
   widows are not unjustly dealt with, it is an evidence of real
   integrity; for we may hence conclude, that there is no respect of
   persons among the judges. But as this subject has been handled
   elsewhere, I only touch on it lightly here.

   And if ye will not shed, he says, innocent blood in this place Here the
   Prophet accuses the judges of a more heinous crime, and calls them
   murderers. They had, however, no doubt some plausible pretences for
   shedding the blood of the innocent. But the Prophet, speaking here in
   the name of God and by the dictates of his Spirit, overlooks all these
   as altogether vain, though the judges might have thought them
   sufficient excuses. By saying, in this place, he shews how foolish was
   their confidence in boasting of God's worship, sacrifices, and Temple,
   while yet they had polluted the Temple with their cruel murders. [191]

   He then passes to the first table of the law, If ye will not walk after
   foreign gods to your evil By stating a part for the whole, he condemns
   every kind of impiety: for what is it to walk after alien gods but to
   depart from the pure and legitimate worship of the true God and to
   corrupt it with superstitions? We see then what the Prophet means: he
   recalls the Jews to the duty of observing the law, that they might
   thereby give a veritable evidence of their repentance: "Prove, "he
   says, "that you have repented from the heart." He shews how they were
   to prove this, even by observing the law of God. And, as I have said,
   he refers to the first Table by stating a part for the whole. As to the
   second Table, he mentions some particulars which were intended to shew
   that they violated justice and equity, and also that cruelty and
   perfidiousness, frauds and rapines, prevailed greatly among them.

   Then follows the latter part, Then I will make you to dwell, [192] etc.
   God sets this clause in opposition to the false confidence of the
   people, as though he had said, "Ye wish me to be propitious to you; but
   mock me not by offering sacrifices without sincerity of heart, without
   a devout feeling; be consistent; and think not that I am pacified by
   you, when ye come to the Temple with empty display, and pollute your
   sacrifices with impure hands. I therefore do not allow this state of
   things; but if ye come on the condition of returning into favor with
   me, then I will make you to dwell in this place and in the land which I
   gave to your fathers." The last part of the verse, from age to age,
   ought to be connected with the verb, "I will make you to dwell, "sknty,
   shekanti, "I will make you to dwell from age to age, "that is, As your
   fathers dwelt formerly in this land, so shall you remain quiet in the
   same, and there shall be to you a peaceable possession; but not in any
   other place. We must bear in mind the contrast which I noticed
   yesterday; for he indirectly denounces exile on the Jews, because they
   had contaminated the land by their vices, and gloried only in their
   sacrifices. It now follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [191] What is to be understood by innocent blood in not only murder,
   nor principally; but the offering of innocent infants to Moloch,
   referred to in the 31st verse of this chapter. -- Ed.

   [192] Calvin departs here from his former rendering in verse 3d. The
   words mean the same, "Then will I dwell with you." So the Vulgate. --

   Jeremiah 7:8

   8. Behold, ye trust in lying words, that cannot profit.

   8. Ecce, vos fiduciam adjicitis ad verba mendacii (vel, fiduciam vobis
   ponitis super verbis mendacii,) quae profectu carent.


   He again teaches what we observed yesterday, -- that the glorying of
   the Jews was foolish, while they boasted of the Temple and of their
   sacrifices to God. He calls their boastings the words of falsehood, as
   we have explained, because they wholly turned to a contrary end what
   God had instituted. It was his will that sacrifices should be offered
   to him in the Temple -- to what purpose? To preserve unity of faith
   among the whole people. And sacrifices, what was their design? To shew
   the people that they deserved eternal death, and also that they were to
   flee to God for mercy, there being no other expiation but the blood of
   Christ. But there was no repentance, they were not sorry for their
   sins; nay, as we shall presently see, they took liberty to indulge more
   in them on account of their ceremonies, which yet ought to have been
   the means of leading them to repentance. They were then the words of
   falsehood when they separated the signs from their ends. The reality
   and the sign ought indeed to be distinguished the one from the other;
   but it is an intolerable divorce, when men lay hold on naked signs and
   overlook the reality. There was in the sacrifices the reality which I
   have now mentioned: they were reminded by the spectacle that they were
   worthy of eternal death; and then, they were to exercise penitence, and
   thus to flee to God's mercy. As there was no account made of Christ, no
   care for repentance, no sorrow for sins, no fear of God, no humility,
   it was an impious separation of what ought to have been united.

   We now then more clearly see why the Prophet designates as words of
   falsehood, that false glorying in which hypocrites indulge, in
   opposition to God, when they would have him satisfied with naked
   ceremonies. Hence he adds, that they were words that could not profit,
   as though he had said, "As ye seek to trifle with God, so he will also
   frustrate your design." It is indeed certain that they dealt
   dishonestly with God, when they attempted to satisfy his judgment by
   frigid ceremonies. He therefore shews that a reward was prepared for
   them; for they would at length find, that no fruit would come from
   their false dealings. It follows --

   name, and say, We are delivered to do all these abominations?

   10. Et venientes et stantes coram facie mea in domo hac (hoc est, in
   hoc templo,) super quam (vel, super quod) invocatum est nomen meum,
   dicetis, Liberati sumus ad faciendum (ut faciamus) omnes abominationes
   istas.

   11. Is this house, which is called by my name, become a den of robbers
   in your eyes? Behold, even I have seen it, saith the LORD.

   11. An spelunca latronum facta est domus haec (vel, templum hoc,) super
   quam invocatum est nomen meum, in oculis vestris? Etiam ego ecce video,
   dicit Jehova.


   The meaning seems to be suspended in the first verse, when he says,
   Whether to steal, to kill, and to commit adultery, etc.; but there is
   nothing ambiguous in the passage. For though there is something abrupt
   in the words, we yet infer this to be the meaning, "Will you steal,
   "etc.? Verbs in the infinitive mood, we know, are often to be
   considered as verbs in the future tense: "Will you steal, murder,
   commit adultery, burn incense to Baal, "etc.? The Prophet shews how
   foolishly the Jews sought to make an agreement with God, so that they
   might with impunity provoke him by their many vices. When they entered
   the Temple, they thought him to be under a necessity to receive them,
   as though that was a proper reconciliation. But the Prophet exposes
   this folly. For what can be more absurd than that God should allow men
   to commit murders, thefts, and adulteries, with impunity? Hypocrites do
   not in words express this; but when they make external ceremonies a
   sort of expiation, and seek by such means to bury their sins, do they
   not make God their associate? Do they not make him a partaker, as it
   were, with them, when they would have him to cover their adulteries?
   When they take sacrifices from their plunders, to expiate their crimes,
   do they not make him a participator in their robberies? The Prophet,
   therefore, plainly condemns hypocrites in this place, because they
   acted most contumeliously towards God, in implicating him in their own
   vices, as though he was the associate of thieves, murderers, and
   adulterers.

   Will you steal, he says, and then, will you kill, commit adultery, and
   swear falsely? These four sins are against the Second Table, in which
   God forbids us to steal, to kill, to commit adultery, and to deceive
   our neighbors by false swearing. These four vices are mentioned, in
   order that the Prophet might shew that all the duties of love were
   wholly disregarded by the Jews. He then adds things which belong to the
   First Table, even the offering of incense to Baal, and the walking
   after alien gods, which yet were unknown to them. By these two clauses
   he proves their impiety. He mentions one kind of idolatry, -- that they
   offered incense to Baal. The Prophets often refer in the plural number
   to Baalim, regarded by the Jews as advocates, by whose intercession, as
   they thought, they gained favor with God; as the case is at this day
   under the Papacy, whose Baalim are angels and dead men: for they regard
   them not as gods, but think that by employing these as advocates they
   conciliate God, and obtain his favor. Such was the superstition which
   prevailed among the Jews. But the Prophet here includes all idols under
   the word Baal. There is afterwards a general complaint, -- that God was
   neglected, and that they had perfidiously departed from him, for they
   walked after alien gods; and he exaggerates the crime by saying that
   they were unknown

   The Prophet, no doubt, intimates here a contrast with the sure
   knowledge, which is the basis of true religion: for God had given
   evident proofs of his glorious power by many miracles, when the
   Israelites were redeemed; and he had afterwards confirmed the same by
   many blessings; and the law had been proclaimed, accompanied with many
   signs and wonders. (Exodus 20:18; Deuteronomy 5:22, 23.) Hence the Jews
   could not have pleaded involuntary error, for after so many proofs
   there could have been no excuse on the ground of ignorance. Now, as to
   alien gods, how came they to know that they were gods? There was no
   proof, they had no reason to believe them to be so. We hence see how
   grievously wicked were the Jews; for they had departed from the worship
   of the true God, who had made himself known to them by many miracles,
   and who had confirmed the authority of his law, so that it could not be
   questioned, and they had gone after unknown gods!

   The Prophet now adds, Ye come, that is, after ye have allowed
   yourselves to steal, and to murder, and to commit adultery, and to
   corrupt the whole worship of God, -- at last, Ye come and stand before
   me in this temple. God proceeds with the same subject; for it was not
   only his purpose in this place to condemn the Jews as murderers, and
   thieves, and adulterers, but he proceeds farther, even to shew their
   shameless effrontery in coming with an unblushing front and entering
   the Temple, as though they were the true worshippers of God. "What do
   you mean, "he says, "by this? Ye bring with you murders, and thefts,
   and adulteries, and abominable filth; ye are contaminated with the most
   disgraceful things: by and bye ye enter the Temple, and think that you
   are at liberty to do anything." Similar is the language we find in the
   first chapter of Isaiah, verses 12 and 15 (Isaiah 1:12, 15): God
   complains there that they trod the pavement of his Temple, and brought
   hands polluted with blood. So also in this place, Ye come, he says,
   intimating his detestation, and ye stand before me in this Temple
   Though God was not inclosed in that Temple, yet we know that the Ark of
   the Covenant was the symbol of his presence. Hence, we often meet in
   the law with this expression, "Ye shall stand before me." Here then,
   God shews that it was a detestable and monstrous thing, that the Jews
   dared to rush into his presence, when polluted and contaminated with so
   many vices.

   And he adds, In this house, on which is called my name, that is, which
   has been dedicated to me; for to call God's name on the Temple, means
   nothing else, but that the Temple was consecrated to him, so that he
   was there worshipped. When God is truly worshipped, they who seek him
   find that he himself is present by his grace and power. As then God had
   commanded the Temple to be built for him, that he might there be
   worshipped, he says his name was there called, that is, according to
   its first and sacred appointment. Absurdly indeed did the Jews call on
   his name, for there was in them no religion, no piety: but according to
   God's institution, his name was called upon in the Temple, as he had
   consecrated it to himself. Hence God reminds them of the first
   institution, which was holy and ought to have continued inviolable:
   "Know ye not, that this place has been chosen by me, that my name might
   be there invoked? Ye stand before me in the holy place, and ye stand
   polluted; and though polluted, not with one kind of vices, but my whole
   law has been violated by you, and my Tables despised, ye yet stand!" We
   hence see the design of the Prophet: for he condemns the effrontery and
   frowardness of the Jews, because they thus dared to rush into God's
   presence in all their pollutions.

   And ye say, he adds, that is, while standing in the Temple; ye say, O,
   we are freed to do all these abominations; that is, "Ye think that the
   Temple is a covert for you to hide all your vices; and so ye think,
   that you have escaped from my hand, as though no account is any more to
   be made of your sins, my Temple being regarded by you as an asylum,
   under whose shade ye take shelter." It is indeed certain, that the Jews
   did not thus speak; for had they been asked whether their life was
   abominable, they would have denied it to be so. He speaks of the fact
   itself, and he speaks in the person of God, and according to his
   command. He therefore condemns hypocrites for thinking themselves
   freed, because they came to the Temple, and for thinking that all those
   abominations which he had mentioned, their impiety towards God and
   their injustice towards their neighbors, would be unpunished. [193]

   He afterwards adds, Is this house, which is called by my name, a den of
   robbers? This is the conclusion of the passage, which contains an
   amplification of their vices. For the Prophet had allowed the Jews to
   form a judgment, as though he had been discussing an obscure or
   doubtful subject, "Behold, be ye yourselves judges in your own case; is
   it right for you to steal, to murder, and to commit adultery? and then
   to come into this Temple, and to boast that impunity is granted to you
   as to all your evils?" This indeed ought to have been enough; but as
   the obstinacy and stupor of the Jews were so great, that they would not
   have given way without being most fully and in various ways proved
   guilty, the Prophet adds this sentence, Is this house, which is called
   by my name, a den of robbers? that is, "Have I chosen this place for
   myself, that ye might worship me, in order that ye might be more
   licentious than if there was no religion? For what purpose is religion?
   Is it not that men may by this bridle restrain themselves, that they
   may not be libertines? For surely the worship and fear of God are the
   directors of equity and justice. Now, would it not be better to have no
   Temple and no sacrifices, than that men should take more liberty to sin
   by making their ceremonies as an excuse? Away then with your
   ceremonies: conscience shews that it is a wretched thing to oppress or
   injure a neighbor; all are constrained by common sense to own that
   adultery is a filthy and a detestable thing; and men think the same of
   rapines and murders. As to superstitions, when they are seen as such,
   all are constrained to allow the worship of God ought to be preserved
   in its purity. Well then, had there been no Temple among you, this
   truth must have been impressed on your minds, -- that God ought to be
   worshipped in purity. Now, because the Temple has been built at
   Jerusalem, because ye offer sacrifices there, ye are thieves, ye are
   adulterers, ye are murderers; and ye think that I am in some sort
   blind, that I am no longer the avenger of so many and of such atrocious
   evils. A den of robbers then is my house become to you." But this
   sentence is to be read interrogatively, "Can it be, that this Temple,
   this sanctuary, is become a den of robbers?" [194]

   But we must consider the import of the comparison: Robbers, though they
   are most audacious and wholly savage, do not yet dare openly to use
   their sword; they dare not kill helpless men. Why? they fear the
   punishment allotted to them by the laws; they are cautious. But when
   they seize on men in some hidden place, then they take more liberty in
   their robberies; they kill men, and then take their property. We hence
   see that dens and hidden places have in them more safety for robbers.
   The comparison then is most suitable, when the Prophet says that the
   Jews made the Temple of God the den of robbers: for had there been no
   Temple, some integrity might have remained, secured by the common
   feeling of men. But when they covered their baseness with sacrifices,
   they thought that they thus escaped all judgment.

   And hence, Christ applied this prophecy to his time; for the Jews had
   even then profaned the Temple. Though they presumptuously and falsely
   called on God's name, they yet sought the Temple as an asylum for
   impurity. This folly Christ exposed, as the Prophet had done.

   He afterwards adds, Even I, behold I see, saith Jehovah Jeremiah here
   no doubt touches ironically on the false confidence with which the Jews
   deceived themselves: for hypocrites seem to themselves to know whatever
   is necessary. And hence also it is, that as they think themselves to be
   acute, they are bolder and more presumptuous in contriving deceitful
   schemes, by which they seek to delude God and men. And hence the
   Prophet here tauntingly touches them to the quick, by intimating that
   they wished to make God as it were blind, Even I, behold I see, he
   says. It would not yet be sufficiently evident how emphatical the
   phrase is, were it not for a similar passage in Isaiah 29:15,

   "I also am wise." The Prophet had said, "Woe to the crafty and the
   wise, who have dug pits for themselves."

   He there condemns ungodly men, who thought that they could somehow by
   their falsehoods deceive God; which seems to be and is monstrous: and
   yet it is an evil which commonly prevails among men. For hardly a man
   in a hundred can be found who does not seek coverings to hide himself
   from the eyes of God. This is the case especially with courtiers and
   clever men, who assume to themselves so much clear-sightedness, that
   God sees nothing in comparison with them. The Lord therefore, by
   Isaiah, gives this answer, "I also am wise: if ye are wise, allow me at
   least some portion of wisdom, and think not that I am altogether
   foolish." So also in this place, "Before my eyes, this house is made a
   den of robbers;" that is, "If there be any sense in you, does it not
   appear evident that you have made a den of robbers of my Temple? and
   can I be yet blind? If you think that you are very clear-sighted, I
   also do see, saith the Lord."

   We hence see what force there is in the particle gm, gam, also, and in
   the pronoun 'nky, anoki, I, and in hnh, ene, behold; for these three
   words are heaped together, that God might shew that he was not
   unobservant, when the people so audaciously ran headlong into all kinds
   of vices, and sought by their falsehoods to cover his eyes, that he
   might not see anything. [195]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [193] The three foregoing verses admit of a different construction,
   though the general meaning continues the same. It is usual to consider
   the words in the ninth verse as verbs in the infinitive mood; but they
   are participles, and stand connected with the previous verse. The
   Targum render them as personal nouns, "thieves, murderers," etc.: but
   they are in Hebrew in the singular number, the collective singular
   being often employed in that language. The passage may be thus
   rendered, -- 8. Behold, ye trust in words of falsehood to no profit, --
   9. The thief, murderer, and adulterer, And the false swearer and
   incense-burner to Baal, And the walker after foreign gods, Whom ye have
   not known; 10. And ye come and stand before me In this house, on which
   is called my name, And ye say, "We are freed To do all these
   abominations," Or, And ye say, "He has made us free To do all these
   abominations." Blayney, following the Syriac, has rendered the words,
   -- And say, Deliver us, that we may practice all these abominations.
   But what is most consistent with the passage is to consider the
   sentence as declarative, and not as a prayer. They considered
   themselves freed from guilt when they had offered their sacrifices.
   They thought themselves then at liberty to be immoral and also to be
   idolatrous. We might think such a state of blindness and infatuation
   impossible; but it has existed among those calling themselves
   Christians, and it exists now. Gataker mentions a common saying among
   ignorant Papists of the same import with what is said here, "We must
   sin to be shriven, and shriven to sin." The turning of the grace of God
   into lasciviousness is the same thing. -- Ed.

   [194] It is to be observed that one only of the vices mentioned in
   verse 9 is here referred to, the first in the catalogue. But as the
   Temple was the den of thieves, so it was also made the asylum of
   murderers, adulterers, and of idolaters. It seems then, that the Jews
   thought that by sacrifices they purchased immunity not only for theft,
   murder, adultery, false swearing, but also for idolatry, and that
   having sacrificed they were free to commit all these evils. How
   unaccountably strange is the conduct of deluded man! The words "Which
   is called by my name," are literally, "Which called is my name upon
   it," an idiomatic mode of speaking, with which the Welsh exactly
   corresponds, -- Yr hwn y gelwir fy enw arno. The pronoun relative
   without a preposition is afterwards followed by a pronoun substantive
   with a preposition prefixed. -- Ed.

   [195] The verb is in the past tense,- I also, behold, seen have I,
   saith Jehovah. That is, He had seen all they did. If anything be put
   after "seen," it should be "these things," and not "it;" for the
   reference is to the particulars before mentioned. See Psalm 10:14;
   Ezekiel 8:12. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou buildest not at this day a temple
   among us of wood and stones, and as the fullness of thy Godhead dwells
   in thine only -- begotten Son, and as he by his power fills the whole
   world, and dwells in the midst of us, and even in us, -- O grant, that
   we may not profane his sanctuary by our vices and sins, but so strive
   to consecrate ourselves to thy service, that thy name through his name
   may be continually glorified, until we shall at length be received into
   that eternal inheritance, where will appear to us openly, and face to
   face, that glory which we now see in the truth contained in thy gospel.
   -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 7:12-14

   12. But go ye now unto my place which was in Shiloh, where I set my
   name at the first, and see what I did to it for the wickedness of my
   people Israel.

   12. Nempe ite nunc (vel, agedum) in locum meum, qui erat in Silo, ubi
   habitare feci nomen meum initio, et videte quid fecerim illic propter
   malitiam populi mei Israel.

   13. And now, because ye have done all these works, saith the LORD, and
   I spake unto you, rising up early and speaking, but ye heard not; and I
   called you, but ye answered not;

   13. Et nunc quia fecistis omnia opera haee (id est, quia imitati estis
   Israelitas) dicit Jehovah, et loquutus sum ad vos mane surgens, et quum
   loquerer, non audistis, et inclamarem vos, non respondistis.

   14. Therefore will I do unto this house, which is called by my name,
   wherein ye trust, and unto the place which I gave to you and to your
   fathers, as I have done to Shiloh.

   14. Faciam igitur domui huic, in qua (super quam) invocatum est nomen
   meum, de qua vos fiditis (in qua vos confiditis, sequitur postea
   relativum) et loco, quem dedi vobis et patribus vestris, sicuti feci
   Silo.


   The Prophet confirms by an example what he said yesterday, -- that the
   Jews deceived themselves in thinking that they were covered by the
   shadow of the Temple, while yet they disclosed themselves, and when the
   whole world were witness of their impious rebellion. He therefore
   mentions what had before happened. The Ark of the Covenant, as it is
   well known, had long rested in Shiloh. Now the Temple did not excel in
   dignity on its own account, but on account of the Ark of the Covenant
   and the altar. It was indeed splendidly adorned; but the holiness of
   the Temple was derived from the Ark of the Covenant, the altar, and the
   sacrifices. This Ark had been in Shiloh. [196] Hence Jeremiah shews how
   foolish were the Jews in being proud, because they had among them the
   Ark of the Covenant and the altar, for the first place, where
   sacrifices had been offered to God, was not preserved in safety. This
   is the import of the whole.

   But he did not in vain say, Even go to Shiloh The ky, ki, here, though
   commonly a causal particle, seems to be taken as explanatory. If yet it
   be viewed only as an affirmative, I do not object, "Well, go to
   Shiloh." But the language in this case is ironical, "Ye glory in the
   Temple; forsooth! go to Shiloh." And God calls it his place -- my
   place, in order that the Jews might understand that it had nothing
   superior in itself. The Ark of the Covenant had indeed been removed
   into Mount Sion, and there God had chosen a perpetual habitation for
   himself; but the other place was superior as to antiquity. This is the
   reason why he calls it "my place, "and adds, Where I made my name to
   dwell, that is, where I designed the Ark to be: for the Ark of the
   Covenant and the altar, with all their furniture, were properly the
   name of God; nor was it by chance that all the tribes had placed the
   Ark in Shiloh; but it was God's will to be there worshipped for a time.
   Hence he says, that the place was sacred before Jerusalem; and
   therefore he says at the first, vr'svnh, berashune; that is, the
   Shilomites are not only equal with you, but antiquity brings them a
   greater honor: if then a comparison is made, they excel you as to what
   is ancient.

   See, he says, what I did to that place for the iniquity of my people
   Israel. He calls here Israel his people, not for honor's sake, but that
   he might again remind the Jews that they were only equal to the
   Israelites; and yet that it profited all the tribes nothing, that they
   were wont to assemble there to worship God. [197] For when we reason
   from example, we must always see that there be no material difference.
   Jeremiah then shews that the Israelites were equal to the Jews, and
   that if the Jews claimed a superiority, the claim was neither just nor
   right, for Israel were also the people of God, inasmuch as it was God's
   will to fix there the Ark of the Covenant, that sacrifices might be
   there offered to him; and then antiquity was in its favor, for it was a
   holy place before it was known that God had chosen Mount Sion as a
   situation for his Temple.

   Hence he draws this conclusion, Now, then, as ye have done all these
   works, that is, as ye have become like the Israelites, therefore, etc.
   But he first amplifies their crime, -- that they had not only imitated
   the wickedness of the twelve tribes, but had also perversely despised
   all warnings, I spake to you, he says, and rose up early By this
   metaphor he intimates, that he was as solicitous for preserving the
   kingdom of Judah, as parents are wont to be for the safety of their
   children: for as a father rises early to see what is necessary for his
   family, so also God says, that he rose early, inasmuch as he had been
   assiduous in exhorting them. He appropriates to his own person what
   properly belonged to his prophets: but as he had roused them by his
   Spirit and employed them in their work, he justly claims to himself
   whatever he had done by them as his instruments: and it was an
   exaggeration of their guilt, that they were slothful, nay, stupid, when
   God sedulously labored for their safety.

   He adds, I spoke, and ye heard not; I cried to you, and ye did not
   answer, he inveighs more at large against their hardness; for had he
   only once warned them, some pretense might have been made; but as God,
   by rising early every day, labored to restore them to himself, and as
   he had not only employed instruction, but also crying, (for by crying
   he doubtless means exhortations and threatenings, which ought to have
   produced greater effect upon them,) there appeared in this contumacy
   the highest degree of mad audacity. The meaning is, -- that God had
   tried all means to restore the Jews to a sound mind, but that they were
   wholly irreclaimable; for he had called them not only once, but often;
   and he had also endued his prophets with power to labor strenuously in
   the discharge of their office: he had not only shewed by them what was
   useful and necessary, but he had cried, that is, had employed greater
   vehemence, in order to correct their tardiness. Since then God, in
   using all these means, could effect nothing, what remained for them was
   miserably to perish, as they willfully sought their own destruction.

   Therefore, he says, I will do to this house, which is called by my
   name, etc. He anticipates, no doubt, all objections, as though he had
   said, "I know what you will say, -- that this place is sacred to God,
   that his name is invoked here, and that sacrifices are here offered:
   all these things, he says, are alleged to no purpose, for in Shiloh
   also was his name invoked, and he dwelt there. Though then ye foolishly
   trust in this place, it shall not yet escape that judgment which
   happened to the former place." He adds, which I gave to you and to your
   fathers Be it so; for this is to be considered as a concession; and at
   the same time objections are anticipated, in order that the Jews might
   understand that it availed them nothing, that God had chosen to build
   his sanctuary on Mount Sion; for the object was to promote religion.
   But as the place was converted to a wholly different purpose, and as
   God's name was there shamefully profaned, he says, "Though I gave this
   place to you and your fathers, yet nothing better shall be its fate
   than the fate of Shiloh." [198] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [196] This was in the tribe of Ephraim, between Bethel and Shechem,
   Judges 21:19, about twenty-five miles north of Jerusalem. The Ark had
   been there more than 300 years. It did not return there after it was
   brought forth in the war against the Philistines. The place afterwards
   declined, and its ruinous state became a proverb. See Joshua 18:1;
   Psalm 78:60; Jeremiah 26:6, 9. -- Ed.

   [197] Blayney thinks that the reference is not to the ruinous condition
   of Shiloh, immediately subsequent to the time when the Ark was removed
   thence, but to the devastation occasioned by the captivity of the ten
   tribes, which was a recent occurrence, this reason is, because they
   were then directed to go and see the place. But if the place had ever
   continued in a ruinous state, and was so at that time, there was every
   propriety in saying, "Go now and see it." Besides, the argument is not
   so complete, as when its dilapidated state, occasioned by the sins of
   the people, when the Ark was thence removed, is referred to. "It is
   probable," says Henry, "that the ruins of that once flourishing city
   were yet remaining: however, they might read the history of it, which
   ought to affect them as if they saw the place." -- Ed.

   [198] The literal rendering of the two verses is as follows:- 13. And
   now, as ye have done all these doings, saith Jehovah, And as I have
   spoken to you, rising early and speaking, And ye have not hearkened,
   And I have called you, and ye have not answered; 14. I will also do to
   the house, On which my name is called, In which ye trust, and to the
   place, Which I gave to you and to your fathers, According to what I did
   to Shiloh: "The house" was the Temple, "the place" was the city: both
   are threatened with destruction. Then he says in the next verse, "And I
   will cast you from my presence." The Temple and the city were to be
   destroyed like Shiloh; and they ("you") were to be dealt with as their
   brethren, the ten tribes, who had been driven into exile. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 7:15

   15. And I will cast you out of my sight, as I have cast out all your
   brethren, even the whole seed of Ephraim.

   15. Et projiciam vos a facie mea, sicuti projeci omnes fratres vestros,
   totum semen Ephraim.


   He concludes the former verse. The Prophet had indeed sufficiently
   explained himself; but this confirmation was necessary for a people so
   refractory. He then alleges nothing new, but only shews that there
   would be no defense to his own people against God's vengeance any more
   than to the Israelites: and hence he now calls them their brethren, as
   he had previously said that they were his people; for the state of the
   ten tribes was the same, until it had pleased God to remove the Ark of
   the Covenant to Mount Sion, that he might have his throne in the tribe
   of Judah. All the children of Abraham were indeed equal; but the
   Israelites were superior in number and in power. And he says, the whole
   seed. This is significantly added; for the Jews had with them only the
   half of the tribe of Manasse. The ten tribes had perished; in nothing
   could they exalt themselves; and they were in this respect inferior,
   because they were only one tribe and half, and the ten tribes were
   larger in number. [199]

   He calls them the seed of Ephraim, because of their first king, and
   also because that tribe was more illustrious than the other nine
   tribes. And in the Prophets Ephraim is in many places named for Israel,
   that is, for that second kingdom, which yet flourished more in wealth
   and power. We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet.

   But we may hence learn this important truth, -- that God had never so
   bound himself to any people or place, that he was not at liberty to
   inflict punishment on the impiety of those who had despised his favors,
   or profaned them by their ingratitude and their sins. And this ought to
   be carefully noticed; for we see that it is an evil as it were innate
   in us, that we become elated and proud whenever God deals bountifully
   with us; for we so abuse his favors as to think that more liberty is
   given us, because God has bestowed on us more than on others. But there
   is nothing more groundless than this presumption; and yet we become
   thus insolent whenever God honors us with peculiar favors. Let us
   therefore bear in mind what is taught here by the Prophet, -- that God
   is ever at liberty to take vengeance on the ungodly and the ungrateful.

   Hence also it appears how foolish is the boasting of the Papists; for
   whenever they bring against us the name of the apostolic throne, they
   think that God's mouth is closed; they think that all authority is to
   be taken away from his word. In short, they harden themselves against
   God, as though they had a legitimate possession, because the gospel had
   been once preached at Rome, and because that place was the first seat
   of the Church in Italy as well as in Europe. But God never favored Rome
   with such a privilege, nor has he said that his habitation was to be
   there. If the Pope and his adherents had what the Jews then possessed,
   (which really belonged to Mount Sion,) who could bear their fury, I say
   not, their pride? But we see what Jeremiah says of Mount Sion, of which
   yet it had been said,

   "This is my rest for ever; here will I dwell,
   because I have chosen it." (Psalm 132:14)

   Go now, he says, to Shiloh Now, since Shiloh and Jerusalem, and so many
   celebrated cities, where the gospel formerly flourished, have been
   taken away from us, it is not to be doubted, but that a dreadful
   vengeance and destruction await all those who reject the doctrine of
   salvation, and despise the treasure of the gospel. Since then God has
   shewn by so many proofs and examples that he is not bound to any
   places, how stupid is their madness who seek, through the mere name of
   an apostolic seat, to subvert all truth and all fear of God, and
   whatever belongs to true religion. Let us now proceed --

   [199] This is hardly correct. The reference is to the state of the Jews
   at that time. The Jews were formed of two tribes, Judah and Benjamin.
   They were joined, after the captivity of Israel, by several of the
   remnants both of Ephraim and Manasseh, and of the other tribes. (2
   Chronicles 34:9.) There is indeed mention made of some from the tribes
   of Ephraim, Manasseh, and Simeon, coming to worship at Jerusalem in the
   reign of Asa; but we do not read that they settled there. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 7:16

   16. Therefore pray not thou for this people, neither lift up cry nor
   prayer for them, neither make intercession to me: for I will not hear
   thee.

   16. Et tu ne ores pro populo hoc, et ne eleves pro ipsis clamorem et
   precationem, et ne occurras (intercedas; est enim translativum verbum,
   nam phn significat obviam ire, sed accipitur pro intercedere, ne ergo
   intercedas) apud me, quia non exaudiam to.


   God, in order to exonerate his servant from every ill-will, forbids him
   to pray for the people. This might have been done for the sake of the
   Prophet, as well as of the whole people; for no doubt Jeremiah regarded
   the ruin of his own nation with great grief and sorrow: as we shall see
   elsewhere, he had not divested himself of all human feelings. He was
   doubtless anxious for the safety of his brethren, and he condoled with
   the miserable, when he saw that they were already given up to
   destruction. But God strengthens him, that he might courageously
   discharge his office; for pity has often melted the hearts of men so as
   not to be able, as they ought, to perform their office. Jeremiah might
   have been more tardy or more temperate in denouncing God's vengeance,
   had not all impediments, which checked his alacrity, been removed.
   Hence then he is bidden to divest himself of sympathy, so that he might
   rise above all human feelings, and remember that he was set a judge
   over the people, or a herald to denounce their final doom. There is yet
   no doubt but that God had respect to the people also, -- to make it
   known to them that Jeremiah was constrained to perform his part,
   however unpleasant it might be to him. Hence, as I have said, he was
   thus relieved from the charge of ill-will, lest he should exasperate
   his own nation while treating them with so much severity.

   Pray not, he says, for this people; and then, Raise not up a prayer
   Some read, "Take not up a prayer." The verb ns', nesha, properly means
   to raise up. We have spoken of this phrase elsewhere; for there are two
   different ways of speaking when prayer is the subject. The Scripture
   sometimes says of the faithful, that they cast a prayer before God; and
   thus is set forth their humility, when they come as suppliants, and
   dare not lift upwards their eyes, like the publican, of whom Christ
   speaks. (Luke 18:13.) We are then said to cast a prayer before God,
   when we humbly seek pardon, and stand before him with shame and self --
   reproach. We are also said, for another reason, to raise up a prayer;
   for when our hearts sink and ascend not to God in faith, it is certain
   that our prayers are not real: hence the faithful, on account of the
   fervor of their desire, are said to raise up their prayers. Even so the
   meaning is here, Raise not up for them a cry and a prayer

   Then he says, Intercede not, for I will not hear thee [200] There is
   yet no doubt but that the Prophet, as we shall see, continued in his
   prayers; but still as one knowing that the safety of the city and
   kingdom would no longer be granted by God: for he might have prayed for
   two things, -- that God would reverse his decree; and this he was
   forbidden to do; -- and, that God would be mindful of his covenant in
   preserving a remnant; and this was done; for the name of the people,
   though the city and the Temple were destroyed, has never been
   obliterated. Some people then survived, though without any distinction
   or renown. And hence at the restoration of the Church God calls its
   subjects a new people, as in Psalm 102:19,

   "A people who shall be created," that is, a new people,
   "shall praise the Lord,"

   as though he intimated that the Babylonian exile would be the ruin of
   his ancient people. God has, however, preserved a remnant, as Paul says
   in Romans 10 and Romans 11. So for the whole body of the people, and
   for the kingdom, the Prophet was not to pray, because he knew that it
   was all over with the people. But on this subject we shall speak more
   at large in another place. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [200] There are here three things forbidden; their distinctive
   character is not correctly given in our version nor by Calvin. I render
   the verse thus, -- And thou, be not an intercessor for this people, Nor
   raise for them a cry and a supplication, Nor make an entreaty to me,
   For I will not hear thee. That is, "Undertake not their cause as one
   who intercedes or mediates between a judge and a criminal, nor cry
   suppliantly for mercy, nor entreat me to be favorable to them." He was
   not to be for them an intercessor, nor a deprecator of evils, nor a
   solicitor of favors. All the versions render the passage loosely. --

   Jeremiah 7:17-19

   17. Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah and in the
   streets of Jerusalem?

   17. An non rvides tu quid ipsi faciant in urbibus Jehudah et in
   compitis Jerusalem?

   18. The children gather wood, and the fathers kindle the fire, and the
   women knead their dough, to make cakes to the queen of heaven, and to
   pour out drink offerings unto other gods, that they may provoke me to
   anger.

   18. Filii colligunt ligna, et patres accendunt ignem, et mulieres ad
   ponendum ut faciant placentas Reginae coelorum, et fundant (libent)
   libamina diis alienis, ut me provocent ad iram.

   19. Do they provoke me to anger? saith the LORD: do they not provoke
   themselves to the confusion of their own faces?

   19. An me ipsi ad iram provocant, dicit Jehova? an non seipsos ad
   erubescentiam facierum suarum?


   Here God shews first why he ought to be implacable towards the people:
   for the command to the Prophet not to pray for them seems at the first
   hearing to be very severe; and it might have been objected and said,
   "What if they repent? Is there no hope of pardon?" God shews that they
   were past remedy -- How so? He says, Dost thou not see? Here he refers
   the examination of the cause to his servant Jeremiah; as though he had
   said, "There is no reason for thee to contend with me; open thine own
   eyes, and consider how they have fallen; for children gather wood, and
   fathers kindle the fire, and women knead dough." Some render the last
   words, "Women are busy with the paste;" but literally, "they set the
   dough, "la paste God intimates here shortly, that the whole people were
   become corrupt, as though they had wickedly conspired together, so that
   men, women, and children, were all led away into idolatry as by a mad
   impulse; for he speaks here only of their superstitions. He had before
   charged them with adulteries, murders, and plunders; but he now
   condemns them for having wholly profaned God's worship, and at the same
   time shews the fruit of their impiety -- that they all strove to outdo
   one another by an insane rivalship.

   The children, he says, gather wood He ascribes the collecting of wood
   to the young; for it was a more laborious work. As then that age excels
   in strength, they collected wood; and the fathers kindled the fire: the
   women, what did they do? They were busy with the meal. Thus no part was
   neglected. "What then is to be done? and what else can I do, but wholly
   to cut off a people so wicked?" Then he says, that they may make kvnym,
   cunim, which is translated "cakes, "and this is the most common
   rendering. Some think that kindling is meant, deriving the word from
   kvh, cue, which means to kindle. But I prefer the opinion of those who
   derive the word from kvn, cun, which is to prepare, as cakes are things
   prepared. I do not then doubt, but that cakes are meant here, as it
   appears also from other places. The second interpretation I regard as
   too refined. [201]

   With regard to the word lmlkt, lamelcath, many consider the letter '
   left out, and think that "works" are intended. In this case m would be
   a servile: but others consider it a radical, and render the word,
   "Queen;" which appears to me probable; though I do not wholly reject
   what some hold that the workmanship of the heavens is here meant. Some
   understand the stars, others the sun, and others the moon: let every
   one enjoy his own opinion. However, I think, that if the workmanship of
   the heavens be meant, the whole celestial host is to be included, as
   the Scripture thus calls all the stars. But if "the Queen of the
   heavens" be adopted, then I am inclined to think that the moon is
   intended: and we know how much superstition has ever prevailed among
   most people as to the worship of the moon. Hence I approve of this
   meaning. Yet I readily admit that all the stars, not one only, may be
   here designated, and called the work or the workmanship of the heavens.
   And the Jews, we know, were very much given to this madness: for as the
   sun was considered by the Orientals as the supreme God, when the Jews
   became enamoured with this error, they also thought that some high and
   adorable divinity belonged to the sun: they turned also afterwards to
   the stars; and this absurdity is often referred to in the Law and also
   in the Prophets. [202]

   It is then added, That they may pour forth libations to foreign gods,
   to provoke me to wrath When God complains of being provoked, it is the
   same as though he had said, that the Jews now openly carried on war
   with him, -- "They sin not through ignorance, nor is it unknown to them
   how much they offend me by these profanations; but it is as it were
   their object and design to provoke me and to carry on war with me by
   these acts of impiety."

   He then subjoins, Do they provoke me, and not rather to the shame of
   their own faces? God here intimates, that however reproachfully the
   Jews acted towards him, they yet brought no loss to him, for he stood
   in no need of their worship. Why then does he so severely threaten
   them? Because he had their sins in view: but yet he shews that he cared
   not for them nor their sacrifices, for he could without any loss be
   without them. Hence he says, that they sought their own ruin, and
   whatever they devised would fall on their own heads. They seek to
   provoke me; they shall know with whom they have to do." It is like what
   is said by the Prophet Zechariah, "They shall know whom they have
   pierced: I indeed continue uninjured; and though they provoke me as
   much as they can, I yet despise all their wickedness, for they cannot
   reach me; they can neither hurt me nor take anything from me." But he
   says, they provoke themselves, that is, their fury shall return on
   their own heads; and hence it shall be, that their faces shall be
   ashamed. [203]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [201] The ancient versions (the Arabic excepted) and the Targum render
   the word, cakes -- placentas It is only found elsewhere in Jeremiah
   44:19. -- Ed.

   [202] The Septuagint render the words here, "the host of heaven," and
   in Jeremiah 44:17 and 19, "the queen of heaven." The Vulgate in the
   three places, renders them "the queen of heaven,"-- the Targum, "the
   star of heaven," -- and the Syriac, "the army of heaven," in the two
   first places, but in the last, "the queen of heaven." There are several
   MSS., in the three places, which insert the ', so as to make the word
   "work," or workmanship: but this change has evidently arisen from the
   Septuagint. But this word is never used to designate the work of the
   visible heavens: the word used in that case is msh. See Psalm 8:3;
   Psalm 19:1; Psalm 102:25; Psalm 143:5. Our version and the Vulgate are
   no doubt right. But what is intended by the queen of heaven is not the
   moon; for the word commonly used for the moon is always masculine, and
   the word generally used for the sun is commonly feminine. This may
   appear strange; but so it is. In South Wales the word for sun is always
   feminine, but in North Wales, masculine. In Deuteronomy 4:19, the sun,
   the moon, and the stars, as constituting the host of heaven, are
   mentioned together: these the first, as including all the rest, seems
   to be intended. Instead of "queen," we should say in our language, "the
   king of the heavens." We do not read that the Jews worshipped the moon;
   but the worship of the sun among them is specifically referred to and
   mentioned. See 2 Kings 23:11; Ezekiel 8:16. The Israelites adored the
   sun under the name of Baal, which was the Chemosh of the Moabites, and
   the Moloch of the Ammonites. -- Ed.

   [203] The verb rendered "provoke," means to disturb, to disquiet, to
   cause an annoyance, to irritate, -- Is it I they are annoying, saith
   Jehovah? Is it not themselves, to the confusion of their own faces?
   They were not disturbing, as it were, the repose of God, but their own.
   They could do no hurt or annoyance to God, but they were annoying and
   injuring themselves; and this would turn out to their own shame and
   confusion. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we are inclined not only to superstitions,
   but also to many vices, we may be restrained by thy word, and as thou
   art pleased daily to remind us of thy benefits, that thou mayest keep
   us in the practice of true religion, -- O grant, that we may not be led
   astray by the delusions of Satan and by our own vanity, but continue
   firm and steady in our obedience to thee, and constantly proceed in the
   course of true piety, so that we may at length partake of its fruit in
   thy celestial kingdom, which has been obtained for us by the blood of
   thine only -- begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 7:20

   20. Therefore thus saith the Lord GOD; Behold, mine anger and my fury
   shall be poured out upon this place, upon man, and upon beast, and upon
   the trees of the field, and upon the fruit of the ground; and it shall
   burn, and shall not be quenched.

   20. Propterea sic dicit Dominus Jehova, Ecce ira mea et furor meus
   (vel, excandescentia, nam verbum hoc significat) conflata est super
   locum hunc, super hominem et super animal (brutum; alii vertunt,
   jumentum, bestiam,) super arborem agri, et super fructum terrae; et
   ardebit, et nullus extinguet.


   Jeremiah proceeds still with the same subject, and explains more at
   large what we have noticed in the preceding lecture, that the ruin of
   Mount Sion and of the Temple was nigh at hand, according to what God
   had before done to Shiloh, where the Ark had long been kept. But that
   his threatening might have more weight, he introduced God as the
   speaker, --

   Behold, he says, my wrath, even mine indignation, has been poured down
   on this place He refers to the metaphor he had before used; and hence
   is confirmed what I then said, -- that God spoke not of prophetic
   teaching, but of the punishments which he had already inflicted and was
   prepared to inflict. On this account he says, that his wrath, or
   vengeance (the cause is put for the effect) had been poured down on the
   city Jerusalem, so as to bring destruction on the cattle as well as
   men, and also on the fruit of the land. It is indeed certain that brute
   animals, as well as trees and the productions of the earth, were
   innocent; but as the whole world was created for man and for his
   benefit, it is nothing strange that God's vengeance should extend to
   innocent animals and to things not endued with reason: for God does not
   inflict punishment on brute animals and on the fruits of the earth,
   except for the purpose of shewing, by extending the symptoms of his
   wrath to all the elements, how much displeased he is with men. The
   whole world, we know, bears at this day in some measure the punishment
   which Adam deserved: and hence Paul says, that all the elements labor
   in pain, aspiring after a deliverance; and he says also, that all
   creatures have been subjected to corruption, though not willingly, that
   is, not through their own fault, but through the sin and transgression
   of man. (Romans 8:20-22.) It is no wonder, then, that God, wishing to
   terrify men, should daily set before their eyes the various forms of
   his vengeance as manifested towards animals, as well as trees and the
   fruits of the earth.

   The meaning then is, -- that God was so angry, that he purposed to
   destroy, not only the Jews, but the land itself, in order that
   posterity might know how grievously they had sinned, against whom God's
   just vengeance had thus kindled. There is therefore no need for us
   curiously to inquire why God shewed his displeasure towards trees and
   brute animals: for it is enough for us to know that God does not in a
   strict sense punish brute animals and trees, but that this is done on
   account of man, that such a sad spectacle may fill them with fear. He
   afterwards adds --

   Jeremiah 7:21-24

   21. Thus saith the Lord of hosts, the God of Israel; Put your burnt
   offerings unto your sacrifices, and eat flesh.

   21. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus Israel, Holocausta vestra addite
   super victimas vestras et comedite carnem.

   22. For I spake not unto your fathers, nor commanded them in the day
   that I brought them out of the land of Egypt, concerning burnt
   offerings or sacrifices:

   22. Quia non loquutus sum cum patribus vestris, et non praecepi illis
   quo die eduxi eos e terra Egypti super verbis (hoc est, rationibus, nam
   rvd proprie significat rationem Latine; Hebraei enim ita passim
   usurpant hanc vocem, sicuti Latini rationem, super rationibus ergo)
   holocaustorum et victimae:

   23. But this thing commanded I them, saying, Obey my voice, and I will
   be your God, and ye shall be my people: and walk ye in all the ways
   that I have commanded you, that it may be well unto you.

   23. Quin potius (sed ky 'm est adversativa particula, hoc est, hae duae
   voces ponuntur loco adversativae, sed) verbum hoc praecepi illis,
   dicendo, Audite vocem meam, et ero vobis in Deum, et vos eritis mihi in
   populum, et ambulabitis in omni via (hoc est, in tota via) quam
   mandavero vobis, ut bene sit vobis.

   24. But they hearkened not, nor inclined their ear, but walked in the
   counsels and in the imagination of their evil heart, and went backward,
   and not forward.

   24. Et non audierunt, et non inclinarunt aurem suam, et ambulaverunt in
   perplexis consiliis (proprie accipitur in malam partem) et in pravitate
   (vel, duritia) cordis sui mali, et fuerunt retro, et non ad faciem.


   The Prophet here taunts the Jews for being so sedulous in their
   attention to sacrifices, while they had no care for piety. Hence he
   says by way of ridicule, "Offer your sacrifices, and accumulate
   burnt-offerings and victims, and eat flesh." The last clause proves
   that God regarded as nothing their sacrifices, and that nothing was
   acceptable to him, though the Jews spent much money and spared no
   labors. God then shews that all these things were nothing to him; eat
   flesh, he says, which means, "Ye sacrifice to yourselves, not to me."
   There is here a contrast implied; for when they did eat flesh, there
   was the legitimate service of God, provided sacrifices were duly
   offered; but God here excludes himself, as though he had said, "These
   things belong not at all to me; for when ye bring sacrifices, your
   object is to feast: eat, then, and stuff your stomachs; nothing of this
   belongs to me." [204]

   The import of the whole is, -- that the feasts which the Jews
   celebrated were profane, though they pretended the name of God, and
   wished them to be deemed sacred. Eat then flesh; that is, "I repudiate
   your sacrifices; it is to no purpose that ye cover your iniquities by
   the shadow of the Temple; for your pollutions restrain me from
   accepting what ye pretend to offer to me." By saying, Add sacrifices to
   victims, he means, that though they sacrificed every animal in the
   land, it would be all to no purpose; for, as I have said, in offering
   sacrifices to God their object was to get a feast, inasmuch as they did
   not regard the right end.

   The Prophet therefore adds, I spoke not to your fathers, nor commanded
   them, in the day I brought them forth from the land of Egypt,
   concerning sacrifices or burnt -- offerings: but this only I commanded
   them, to hear my voice, and to walk in all the way which I commanded
   them. Jeremiah seems to have condemned sacrifices too much; for we know
   they were designed for certain purposes: they were intended to promote
   penitence; for when an animal was killed at the altar, all were
   reminded that they were guilty of death, which the animals underwent
   instead of men. Hence God did thereby represent to the Jews, as in a
   mirror, the dreadful judgment they deserved; and the sacrifices were
   also living images of Christ; they were sure pledges of that expiation
   through which men are reconciled to God. Jeremiah then seems here to
   speak too contemptibly of sacrifices; for they were seals of God's
   grace, and had been instituted to lead men to repentance. But he speaks
   according to the ideas of those who had strangely vitiated the worship
   of God; for the Jews were sedulously attentive to sacrifices, and yet
   neglected the main things -- faith and repentance. Hence the Prophet
   here repudiates sacrifices, because these false worshippers of God had
   adulterated them; for they were only intent on external rites, and
   overlooked their design, and even despised it.

   We know that it was God's will from the beginning to be worshipped in a
   spiritual manner; and he has not changed his nature in our day. As then
   at this day he approves of no other than a spiritual worship, as He is
   a Spirit, (John 4:24) so also under the Law he was to be worshipped
   with a sincere heart. Absurdly then did the Jews offer their
   sacrifices, as though they could thereby appease God: and this is the
   reason why the prophets inveighed so pointedly against sacrifices. God
   says that he nauseated them, that he was wearied with them, that his
   name was thereby polluted, (Isaiah 1:14) he says also, that to
   sacrifice was the same as though one killed a dog, an unclean animal,
   and as though one killed a man. (Isaiah 66:3.)

   "What are your offerings and sacrifices to me."

   he says by Amos. Such declarations occur everywhere in the Prophets; we
   are told that sacrifices were not only of no account before God, but
   that they were filthy things which he abominated; that is, when the
   things signified were separated from the signs. This then is the reason
   why Jeremiah here wholly rejects sacrifices: he complains that God's
   worship was violated and profaned; and it was so, because the Jews
   presented to God mere shadows instead of realities.

   But still he seems to have exceeded due limits; as he says of God, that
   he gave no command respecting sacrifices: for before the law was
   published, God had ordered sacrifices to be offered to him; as, for
   instance, the passover; for the pascal lamb, as it is well known, was a
   sacrifice; and he had also spoken of sacrifices before the people were
   liberated. Moreover, after the law was given, a priesthood was
   established among the people, as Moses clearly shews. Further still, we
   see with what care regulations have been given as to sacrifices. Why
   then is it here said, that he spoke nothing respecting sacrifices? Even
   because God regards not sacrifices in themselves. He therefore makes a
   distinction between external signs and spiritual worship; for the Jews,
   as it has been already said, had by their corruptions so subverted what
   God had instituted, that he would not acknowledge what they did as
   having been commanded by him. And if we take the words as they are,
   they are wholly true, -- that God had commanded nothing respecting mere
   sacrifices, or sacrifices for their own sake. This distinction solves
   every difficulty; that is, that God never delighted in sacrifices
   themselves, that it was never his will to be served with mere external
   rites, that burnt -- offerings, victims, incense, and things of this
   kind, were of themselves regarded by him of no value. Since, then,
   sacrifices did not please God, except on account of the end designed,
   it remains a clear truth, that God commanded nothing respecting
   sacrifices: for his design only was to remind the Jews of their sin,
   and also to shew to them the way of reconciliation. We hence see that
   God had not from the beginning required mere sacrifices, for he
   required them for a certain end. It is the same as though we should say
   at this day, that God regards not fasting. We yet know that fasting is
   commended to us, but not on account of itself. We now understand the
   meaning of the Prophet. [205]

   Now, this passage contains a very useful doctrine, and which ought the
   more to be observed by us, as the neglect of it introduces dreadful
   darkness. They under the Papacy think that God is duly and in the best
   manner worshipped, when they accumulate many pompous exhibitions of
   ceremonies; nor can they be persuaded that all this is altogether
   frivolous. How so? Because they think of God according to their own
   fancies and disposition. And yet all the Papal ceremonies are the
   inventions of men: for they derive no authority either from the Law or
   from the Gospel. And since God has so severely reprobated ceremonies,
   which yet he had appointed for a purpose which was overlooked, what can
   be thought at this day of the foolish inventions of men, when there is
   the some impiety in the people as was formerly in the Jews? For when
   the Papists perform their trumperies, when the monks and the
   sacrificing priests fill the churches with their noises, when they
   practice their childish mummeries, and when they delight themselves
   with music and incense, they think that God is satisfied, however full
   of obscenities and filthiness their whole life may be: they are
   hardened in that false confidence, by which the Jews were inebriated.
   We ought, therefore, with special care, to notice this doctrine, --
   that God so approves of spiritual worship, that he esteems all other
   things as nothing; that is, when unconnected with sincerity of heart.

   I spoke not then to your fathers, nor commanded them in the day I
   brought them forth from the land of Egypt, etc. The Prophet calls the
   attention of the Jews to the first condition of the Church; for though
   God had made his covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, yet he then
   only formed or framed for himself a Church when the Law was
   promulgated. Hence God at that time showed what pleased him, and
   prescribed certain things, which were in future to be inviolably
   observed: and as the Jews violated the rule given them, the Prophet
   concludes that God was corruptly and absurdly worshipped by them. This
   is the reason why he expressly speaks here of the deliverance granted
   to the fathers. There follows afterwards a clearer explanation, which
   removes all ambiguity: for God subordinates sacrifices to obedience.
   Yet sacrifices are a part of obedience: very true; but as the people
   were to be subject to the whole law, it hence follows, that the worship
   of God was mutilated by them, when there was no care for true piety. We
   now then, no doubt, understand the meaning of the Prophet, and see at
   the same time the reason why God so expressly rejected sacrifices: for
   what God has connected, it is not in the power of man to separate.
   (Matthew 19:6; Mark 10:9.) This rending of things is impious. As the
   Jews had separated sacrifices from their right and legitimate end,
   whatever they did was a sacrilege and a profanation.

   That we may now more fully comprehend this doctrine, we must remember
   this principle -- that the basis of true religion is obedience. For
   unless God shines on us with his word, there is no religion, but only
   hypocrisy and superstition; as the case is with heathens, who, though
   they busy themselves much and with great diligence, yet loose all their
   labor, and uselessly weary themselves, for God has not shewn to them
   the right way. In short, true religion may always be distinguished from
   superstition by this mark -- If the truth of God guides us, then our
   religion is true; but if any one follows his own reason, or is led by
   the opinion and consent of men, he forms for himself superstition; and
   nothing that he does will please God. This is one thing.

   Now, in the second place, let us see what God chiefly requires from
   those who are his servants. Being fully convinced of this truth -- that
   God cannot be truly served, except we obey his voice, we must consider,
   as I have said, what God commands us to do. Now, as he is a Spirit, so
   he demands sincerity of heart. (John 4:24.) We also know that God so
   comes to us, that he would have us to trust wholly in his gratuitous
   goodness, that he would have us to depend altogether on his paternal
   kindness, that he would have us to call on him, and to offer him the
   sacrifice of praise. Since, then, God has expressly required these
   things in his word, it is certain, that all other modes of worship are
   rejected by him as vitious; that is, when there is no faith, when there
   is no prayer and praise: for these hold the first place in true and
   legitimate worship.

   This one passage is sufficient to put an end to all the contentions
   which are now in the world. For if the Papists admitted that obedience
   is of more account with God than all sacrifices, (1 Samuel 15:22,) we
   might easily agree. They might afterwards debate every article of
   faith; but there would be in the main an agreement between us, were
   they to submit simply and unreservedly to the word of God. But we see
   how pertinaciously they insist on this point -- that we are not to
   stand on God's word, nor acquiesce in it, because there is in it
   nothing certain. Hence they regard the doctrine of the Fathers, and
   what they call the perpetual consent of the Catholic Church, as of more
   value than the Law and the Prophets and the Gospel. They dare not
   indeed to contend on this ground; and so far they act wisely: for if
   the disputes between us are capable of being removed, as I have said,
   by God's word, we could easily overcome them. But while they, fostering
   their own blindness, strive to extinguish the light, and willfully
   envelop themselves in darkness, let us follow what God's Spirit shews
   to us here, -- that the main part of true and right worship and service
   is to hear God speaking, and to regard obedience of more account than
   all offerings and sacrifices, according to the passage we have quoted
   from 1 Samuel 15:22.

   He afterwards adds, I will be to you a God, and ye shall be to me a
   people; and ye shall walk in all the way which I shall shew to you,
   that it may be well with you. The Prophet confirms what I have already
   said, that if we would obey God, we must consider what he commands. Now
   God omits no part of true worship: we shall then never go astray from
   true religion, if only we render ourselves teachable. Whence then is
   it, that men diligently labor and profit nothing, except that they are
   deaf to God's voice? for as it has been already often said, God has not
   only spoken generally, and in various ways, of obedience, but has
   clearly and distinctly taught what he approves. Our obedience then will
   please him, if only we learn what he would have us to do.

   And at the same time he adds, that this condition was mentioned to the
   Jews, that it would be well with them, if they only obeyed God. Hence
   their perverseness is more fully detected; for they willfully sought to
   be miserable, and procured for themselves their own destruction: for a
   happy life was offered to them, provided only they submitted to God.
   Since they refused this, who does not see that they willfully gave
   themselves up to misery, as though they wished to provoke God's anger,
   and did so designedly? for it immediately follows --

   They hearkened not nor inclined their ear Here the Prophet shews, that
   the Jews did not then begin to be rebellious against God and his word;
   for they imitated the impious contumacy of their fathers: and he dwells
   on this more at large. He now says, "I gave no command about
   sacrifices, but only this one thing I required of your fathers, to obey
   me." They hearkened not, he says. What could have been a juster demand
   than that they should obey God? How great, then, and how base an
   indignity it was, to reject his authority? Nay, still more, they
   inclined not the ear: for by this phrase the Prophet means not only a
   contempt of his word and indifference, but their obstinacy and
   willfulness, inasmuch as they had hardened themselves against God.
   Hypocrites do, indeed, sometimes incline the ear, and wish to know what
   is said, and in some measure consider it: but the Prophet here sets
   forth as it were the insane contumacy of the Jews, for they inclined
   not, no, not even the ear to God speaking to them.

   He afterwards adds, that they walked in their tortuous counsels, and
   also, in the wickedness of their evil heart [206] This comparison
   aggravates their sin, -- the Jews preferred to follow their own humor
   rather than to obey God and his commands. Had anything been set before
   them, which might have deceived them and obscured the authority of the
   law, there would have been some excuse: but when there was nothing to
   prevent them from obeying the command of God, except that they followed
   their own foolish imaginations, they were wholly inexcusable. For what
   excuse could they have made? That they wished to be wiser than God! How
   great a madness was this, and how diabolical? But the Prophet leaves
   them nothing but this vain excuse, which doubled their guilt. They
   thought, no doubt, that their heart was well fitted for the purpose:
   but he does not here allow them to judge, but distinctly condemns them
   as they deserved.

   We ought to take particular notice of this passage; for the majority of
   men at this day set up their own fictions against God's word. The
   Papists indeed pretend antiquity; they say that they have been taught
   by their ancestors; and at the same time they plead councils and the
   ordinances of the fathers: but yet there is not one of them, who is not
   addicted to his own figments, and who does not take the liberty, nay,
   an unbridled license, to reject whatever he pleases. Moreover, if the
   origin of the whole Papal worship be considered, it will appear, that
   those who first devised so many strange superstitions, were only
   impelled by audacity and presumption, in order that they might trample
   under foot the word of God. Hence it is, that all things are become
   corrupt; for they brought in all the strange figments of their own
   brains. And we see that the Papists at this day are so perversely fixed
   in their own errors, that they prefer themselves and their own
   trumperies to God. And the same is the case also with all heretics.
   What then is to be done? Obedience, as I have said, is to be held as
   the basis of all true religion. If, then, on the other hand, we wish to
   render our worship approved by God, let us learn to cast aside whatever
   is our own, so that his authority may prevail over all our reasons.

   Let us further notice how detestable a sacrilege it is, to follow the
   wickedness of our heart rather than to obey God, when he shews to us,
   as by the finger, the way of salvation. Let us also observe, that
   nothing will then do us good, though we may seem to ourselves to be
   very wise, and praise ourselves in our folly; for God declares here
   that our heart is evil whenever we turn aside from his pure word.

   He says, that they were behind and not before By this phrase he
   intimates that the Jews turned the back, that they might not look at
   him or go forward. For when one promises to be our leader to conduct us
   in the way, we immediately turn our eyes to him; but when we turn our
   back, it is a proof of our contempt. And thus God complains of his
   people, that he was despised by them; for they had not only been deaf
   to the prophetic teaching and admonitions, but had also turned their
   faces another way, as a proof of a contumacy still worse, so that they
   forsook him, and as it were bade him to be gone. [207] This is the
   import of the last sentence. We shall proceed to-morrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [204] The meaning is not so plain as it might have been made: the
   burnt-offerings were all consumed by fire; but a part of the
   peace-offerings and of other offerings was eaten. See Leviticus 1:9;
   and Leviticus 7:11-16. Then God says, by way of contempt, "Add your
   burnt-offerings to your other offerings, and thus you will have your
   appetites gratified." Some derive the verb rendered "Add," from sphh,
   which means to sweep together; and "collect together -- sunagagete," is
   the Septuagint; "heap together" is the Syriac. This comports better
   with the contemptuous strain of the passage, -- Your burnt-offerings
   sweep together To your sacrifices, and eat flesh. -- Ed.

   [205] This exposition is ingenious and plausible, and all that is said
   is perfectly true: but it may be doubted whether it be the way to
   account for the mode of speaking here adopted. It is usual in
   Scripture, when two things are mentioned, and the one is of little or
   no importance in comparison with the other, to state the first
   negatively. "Labor not, "says our Savior, "for the meat which
   perisheth, but for that meat which endureth unto everlasting life."
   John 6:27. But it may be, that the reference here is specifically to
   the day in which the Israelites were delivered; for on that day, or at
   that particular time, (for the word day is not to be taken in its
   strict meaning,) obedience to his voice was the only thing which God
   required. See Exodus 15:26. Venema thinks that reference is here made,
   not to the institution of sacrifices, but to the ground of the
   covenant. Sacrifices were not the condition of the covenant, but
   obedience. God did not say, "If you sacrifice to me, I will be your
   God;" but, "If you obey my voice, I will be your God, and you shall be
   my people." When the law was delivered on Mount Sinai, there was no
   mention of sacrifices. -- Ed.

   [206] The words are literally, -- And they walked in the counsels, --
   In the resolutions of their evil heart. They not only devised their own
   ways, but resolved to walk in them. They formed their own counsels, and
   made resolutions to follow them, and they were the counsels and
   resolutions of a disordered and perverted heart. In rendering the last
   word "wickedness," Calvin has followed the Vulgate; and our version,
   "imagination," is the Targum. It is omitted in the Septuagint, and
   "desires" in Syriac. See [6]note on Jeremiah 3:17. -- Ed.

   [207] The words are, -- And they were for behind, and not for before
   them; which seem to mean, that they were bent on turning back to their
   own ways rather than to go on in the ways of God. The version of the
   Septuagint is, "They were for things behind, and not for things
   before;" the Syriac and Arabic, "They retrograded and did not advance,
   "or go forward. The allusion seems not to be, as Blayney thinks, to
   refractory oxen under the yoke; but to those travelers who, when shewn
   the right way, go back instead of going forward. And this was
   especially true of the Israelites, who, after having left Egypt, wished
   often to return, instead of going forward to Canaan. Hence it is said,
   that they were going back to their old ways, and not going forward in
   the way which God bad pointed out to them. The phrase in Jeremiah 2:27,
   is of another kind, and ought not to be confounded with this. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast at this day so clearly revealed
   to us thy will that there can remain no pretense of ignorance, we may
   on that account submit to thee with a freer and more ready mind, and
   that we may not only incline our ears to thee, but also so attend to
   thee with all our hearts, that we may desire no other thing than to
   make our whole life approved by thee: and as we cannot but turn aside,
   through our obstinacy and wickedness, from the right way, do thou so
   enlighten us by the Spirit of wisdom and knowledge, that we may strive
   to embrace whatever thou hast been pleased to prescribe to us in thy
   word, so that when the course of this life shall be finished, we may at
   length reach the goal, and partake of the fruit of our obedience, and
   enjoy that eternal inheritance, which thine only -- begotten Son has
   procured for us by his own blood. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 7:25-26

   25. Since the day that your fathers came forth out of the land of Egypt
   unto this day I have even sent unto you all my servants the prophets,
   daily rising up early and sending them:

   25. Ab eo die quo egressi sunt patres vestri e terra Egypti usque ad
   diem hunc misi ad vos omnes servos meos prophetas, quotidie mane
   surgendo et mittendo:

   26. Yet they hearkened not unto me, nor inclined their ear, but
   hardened their neck: they did worse than their fathers.

   26. Et non audierunt me, et non inclinaverunt aurem suam; et (pro sed)
   obdurarunt cervicem suam, perverse egerunt prae patribus suis.


   God complains of the perverse wickedness of the people, -- that he had
   lost all his labor in endeavoring to lead them to repentance, not only
   in one age, but that the children succeeded their fathers in their
   corruptions, and that thus the imitation had become perpetual. This
   might indeed appear as an extenuation of their fault; they might have
   pleaded as the Papists at this day do; who have no pretext more
   specious, than when they bring against us the Fathers and antiquity.
   But God shews in this place and elsewhere that the children are not
   excused by the examples of their fathers; but on the contrary, that it
   is an aggravation of the crime, when men thus harden themselves, and
   think that a continued indulgence in vices avails them for a precedent;
   for God does not thus permit himself to be deprived of his own right.
   This passage then deserves particular notice; for God not only
   condemned those who were then living and whom Jeremiah addressed, but
   also connected with them the dead, in order to prove their greater
   obstinacy, as impiety had been as it were handed down from one age to
   another.

   From the day, he says, in which your fathers came forth from the land
   of Egypt unto this day, have I sent to you, etc. We know how
   intractable the people had been from the beginning; for they did all
   they could to reject Moses, the minister of a favor so remarkable and
   invaluable. And after their deliverance, they were continually either
   clamoring against God, or openly contending with Moses and Aaron, or
   running into gross idolatry, or giving loose reins to their lusts; in
   short, there was no end to their course of sinning: and yet Moses daily
   endeavored to restore them to obedience. It was this great contumacy
   that God now refers to; and he says, that the Israelites did not then
   begin to be disobedient, but that they had ever been of such a
   disposition as not to bear to be corrected, as he will tell us
   hereafter. It was not necessary here to adduce examples to shew that
   the people had been indomitable; for this was evident from sacred
   history. It was enough to remind them, that the hardness and obstinacy
   of the fathers had descended to their children, so that they might know
   that they were twofold and treblefold guilty before God, for they had
   imitated the perverseness which God had before severely punished; nor
   was it unknown to them how God had brought judgments on their fathers.
   It was therefore to provoke God most wantonly, when they overlooked and
   disregarded such dreadful vengeances as he had executed on their
   progenitors. We shall hereafter see similar declarations; nay, this way
   of speaking occurs everywhere in the prophets, that is, that their race
   had been from the beginning perverse and rebellious, and that they had
   also in all ages despised the favor of God and obstinately resisted the
   prophets.

   But God reminds them here, that from the day they came forth from the
   land of Egypt he had never ceased to speak to them even to the time of
   Jeremiah: this his perseverance greatly aggravated the sin of the
   people. Had God spoken only once, it would have been sufficient for
   their condemnation: but inasmuch as he had borne with their perverse
   conduct, and never ceased from day to day kindly to call them to
   himself and to promise them pardon and to offer salvation to them --
   inasmuch then as God had thus persevered, the more fully discovered was
   the irreclaimable impiety of the people. We indeed know how dreadful a
   punishment must await those who dare thus to abuse the forbearance of
   God and openly to scorn his word, when he invites them a hundred or a
   thousand times to repentance.

   He afterwards adds, that he had sent all his servants, [208] etc In the
   same sense is to be taken the universal particle, kl, cal, "all." Had
   God sent only one prophet, there would have remained no excuse for the
   Israelites; but as he had continually sent one after another, to train
   them up like an army, how great was their madness to despise so large a
   number? We indeed know that there were never wanting prophets among the
   people, as Moses had promised in the eighteenth chapter of Deuteronomy.
   As then God had dealt bountifully with the people, so that prophets had
   never ceased but continually succeeded one another, hence surely the
   baseness of their impious obstinacy became more evident; for they had
   not despised God only for one day, nor disregarded one prophet, or two
   or three, but resisted all the prophets, though they had been sent in
   great number. I sent, he says, all my servants

   Then he adds, daily This is mentioned for the same purpose, even to
   shew that God had never been wearied, and that they had resisted as it
   were designedly his goodness, while he was incessant in kindly
   exhorting them to repentance. He says, by rising early and sending As
   we have said elsewhere, the verb skm, shecam, properly means to rise
   early. God here commends the authority of prophetic instruction by
   ascribing to himself what is done by men. With him, indeed, as we all
   know, there is no change; hence the expression, to rise up, as applied
   to him, is not strictly true; but what he commanded his servants to do,
   he transfers, as we have said, to himself, in order that he might more
   sharply reprove the ingratitude of the people; as though he had said,
   that he had been most carefully attentive to secure their salvation,
   but that they had been torpid and wholly indifferent.

   We may hence learn a useful doctrine, -- that God rises to invite us,
   and also to receive us, whenever his word is proclaimed among us, by
   which he testifies to us his paternal love. God then not only employs
   men to lead us to himself, but comes forth in a manner himself to meet
   us, and rises early as one solicitous for our salvation. This
   commendation of divine truth may be of great benefit to the faithful,
   and induce them to recumb confidently and with tranquil minds on God's
   promises; for they are the same as though God himself had spoken them
   to us. But here is also reproved the impiety of those who slumber and
   sleep, while God thus watches in order to promote their salvation, and
   who lend not an ear, when he rises early to come to them in order to
   draw them to himself.

   He afterwards subjoins, And they hearkened not There is here a change
   of person; for he said in the last verse, "your fathers," "I sent to
   you;" but now he says, They hearkened not, nor inclined their ear It is
   indeed true, that the reference is to the fathers; but in the next
   verse God includes the people who were then living. There is then no
   doubt but that it was an evidence of indignation, that he changed the
   person, and that he was wearied in addressing them, for he saw that he
   spoke in vain to a stupid people: and this will appear evident from the
   next verse. They hearkened not, he says, nor inclined their ear The
   words we have already explained: the Jews are here precluded from
   having any excuse on the ground of error or ignorance; for they had
   refused to be taught, they would not attend, but on the contrary made
   deaf their cars. And he says also, that they hardened their neck; by
   which their perverseness is still more fully expressed: they designedly
   as it were despised God, and carried on war even with his favor and
   kindness. And he concludes by saying, that they had done worse than
   their fathers He had said, "your fathers;" but now, "their fathers." We
   hence see that the sentence is changed, for God knew that he could
   produce no effect on them, as we find by what follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [208] The former part of this verse would better connect with the
   former verse, than with this sentence. There is the copulative v,
   "and," before the verb "sent." The sending of the prophets is mentioned
   in addition to the first command given to them. The passage may be thus
   rendered, -- And they went backward and not forward, 25. From the day
   in which your fathers came forth From the land of Egypt, to this day:
   And I sent to you all my servants the prophets, Every day rising early
   and sending; 26. Yet they hearkened not to me, Nor inclined their ear,
   But hardened their neck; They have been more wicked than their fathers.
   Such is the connection in all the ancient versions and in the Targum.
   The verb, rendered "they have been more wicked," or "done worse," is
   omitted by the Septuagint and the Syriac; but retained by the Vulgate
   and the Targum, and is found wanting in no MS. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 7:27

   27. Therefore thou shalt speak all these words unto them; but they will
   not hearken to thee: thou shalt also call unto them; but they will not
   answer thee.

   27. Et dices illis omnia verba haec, et non audient to (vel, non
   auscultabunt tibi,) et clamabis ad eos, et non respondebunt tibi.


   Here is seen more clearly what I have stated, -- that the Jews were not
   addressed, because they had no ears. Here then God addresses his
   Prophet and says, "The children will be like their parents: for thou
   shalt indeed bear the commands which I give thee, but it will be
   without any advantage; for they will not hear, and when thou callest to
   them, they will not answer " It was a most grievous trial to the
   Prophet to know that his words would pass away with the air and produce
   no good. What was to be expected but that God's wrath would thus be
   still more kindled against the people? The Prophet then must have had
   his mind greatly depressed; for he doubtless labored for the good of
   his own nation; and we shall hereafter see how sad he was when he
   understood that their final ruin was at hand. But, as we have said
   elsewhere, the prophets were influenced by two feelings: for they did
   not divest themselves of all human affections, inasmuch as they loved
   their own nation and felt great sorrow, when God declared that he was
   coming to execute judgment: but this sympathy and sorrow did not
   prevent them from executing, in a bold manner, and with unshaken zeal,
   what God had committed to them. Thus then the prophets had feelings to
   condole with their own kindred, and at the same time were enabled to
   surmount whatever might check or hinder them from performing their
   office. Jeremiah did thus condole with his own nation, when he knew
   that shortly ruin would overtake them; but yet he felt bound to execute
   what God had bidden him to do, and to obey his call.

   However bitter therefore was the declaration, Thou shalt speak to them,
   but they will not hear, yet Jeremiah went forth; for he knew that he
   must obey God's command, whatever might be the issue. The same
   resolution ought to be formed at this day by all the faithful ministers
   of God. They ought to strive as far as they can to promote the
   salvation of the people; but still when they see that their doctrine
   succeeds not as they wish, and that it is the savor of death to the
   whole world, they ought nevertheless to follow their course: why?
   because they are always a sweet and good savor to God, whatever may be
   the event. God then declares to his servant what would be the issue, in
   order that he might not cease to execute his office with invincible
   courage, even if no fruit appeared. It was also his purpose to shew
   before the time to the people their perverseness, if there was possibly
   any hope, or at least, that he might doubly prove them to be
   unhealable. It was further his design to consult the good of those few
   who cherished true religion in their hearts, though the multitude were
   running headlong to their own ruin.

   In like manner at this day it is necessary thus to sustain the souls of
   the faithful; for while the ungodly rave against God, and while almost
   the whole world is seized with this madness, what would become of the
   godly, had they not this fact to think of, -- that it is nothing new
   for hypocrites, who boast that they are God's people and his Church, to
   reject his grace and to regard as nothing his servants. This truth then
   is serviceable to us at this day, and may be applied in the same way,
   so that our minds may not despond nor vacillate, when we see the
   majority of those, whom God addresses by his servants, heedless and
   deaf. Thou shalt speak to them, he says, all these words

   He says not without a reason, All these words; for if the Prophet had
   only briefly declared to them what he had heard from God's mouth, he
   might have discharged his office with less weariness; but when he had
   often repeated what had been committed to him, it was not done without
   great trouble and sorrow; for as we have said at the beginning, he
   spent his labor on the people, not for one year or for ten years; for
   he preached to them for twenty, thirty, forty years, and pursued his
   course even beyond that time. When he saw the truth of God thus
   rejected by the people, how could he otherwise than feel weariness at
   times? It is therefore not in vain intimated, as I have said, that he
   was chosen, that he might try, not only for one day, or for a few
   months or years, whether he could recover the people to the way of
   salvation, but that he was to go on through all obstacles, so as not to
   faint, whatever might take place. They will not hear thee, he says: and
   further, --

   Thou shalt call to them, and they will not answer thee This also, which
   God foretells him, is emphatical, -- that if the Prophet called most
   loudly, (as Isaiah is bidden to do, (Isaiah 58:1,) and in his person
   all teachers,) and called even to hoarseness, yet he is told they would
   not answer. This shews still more fully their perverseness; for they
   were not only deaf to God's voice and neglected plain teaching, but
   also disregarded the most vehement exhortations, he then adds --

   Jeremiah 7:28

   28. But thou shalt say unto them, This is a nation that obeyeth not the
   voice of the LORD their God, nor receiveth correction: truth is
   perished, and is cut off from their mouth.

   28. Et dices ad eos, Haec gens, quae non audierunt vocem Jehovae Dei
   sui, et non receperunt disciplinam; periit veritas et excisa est ab ore
   eorum.


   God shews now that he must act in a new way. The first duty of teachers
   is to set forth the will of God, to shew what is right, and then to
   exhort, if plain teaching proves not sufficient. But God intimates here
   that he was under the necessity to change his manner, because they were
   wholly irreclaimable. Thou shalt then say this as the last thing; as
   though he had said, "I indeed wished to try, whether they were capable
   of being improved, and have employed thee for this purpose: after
   having long borne with them, knowing by a long trial that thy labor is
   useless, thou shalt say to them, "I bid you adieu at last." For what is
   the meaning of these words, This is a nation which heard not the voice
   of its God, except that the Prophet, after long trials, knew that he
   was neither to teach nor exhort them? It is not to be doubted but that
   God referred to the Jews themselves; for it was his object to expose
   their impious perverseness. He yet comforted his servant; for he hence
   knew, that though he could do no good to his hearers, yet his labor was
   acceptable to God and not without its fruit: for the truth of God is
   not only fruitful in the salvation of men, but also in their perdition.
   (2 Corinthians 2:15, 16.) God then shews, that there would be no loss
   to his servant, even though the Jews repented not; for he would be
   their judge, and denounce by the highest authority their destruction.

   We now perceive the design of the Holy Spirit, in saying, Thou shalt at
   length say, This is a nation which has not hearkened to the voice of
   its God: for the Prophet is not bidden here to address the Jews, but to
   pronounce on them a sentence, that the whole world might know how base
   and detestable had been their contumacy, and how abominable their
   impiety; for the whole nation had refused to hear The word nation seems
   here to be taken in a bad sense: it is indeed in many places to be
   taken for "people;" but in other places Scripture sets gvym, guim, in
   opposition to God's chosen people. And perhaps this word has been used,
   that the Jews might know that they in vain gloried in their own
   dignity. He shews that they did not excel other nations, for they were
   themselves of the same class, a nation. This is a nation, he says,
   which has not hearkened to the voice of Jehovah their God [209] In
   saying this he doubtless amplified their crime; for as God had made
   himself plainly known to the Jews, they could not pretend ignorance nor
   plead any doubt respecting what the prophets taught. As then they had
   designedly rejected their own God, they hence became more obviously
   guilty and abominable.

   He afterwards adds, They have not received correction, he points out
   the very source of rebellion, -- they were unwilling to undertake the
   yoke. Here then he excludes all those plausible pretences by which the
   Jews might cloak their impiety, as hypocrites are ever wont to do.
   Hence he declares that they had been unteachable, for they had refused
   correction. The word mvsr, musar, often means chastisement; but
   generally signifies every kind of training. As the subject here is
   teaching, the Prophet means that they were willfully blind, for they
   would not be taught; Now this is the extremity of wicked perverseness,
   that is, when men become so degenerated, that they willfully assimilate
   themselves to brute beasts by rejecting the yoke of God.

   He then subjoins, that truth, or faith, had perished The word 'mvnh,
   amune, may be taken in two senses. Some refer it to what belongs to
   God, as meaning religion, or faith: or piety. But the Prophet seems to
   take it in a larger sense, as signifying what is sincere; for they
   acted perfidiously towards men as well as towards God. The word then is
   to be taken simply as meaning integrity, as though he had said, that
   nothing true or sincere remained in them, but that they were so corrupt
   that they mocked God and deceived men, and that nothing but
   dissimulation prevailed among them. This meaning is confirmed by what
   follows, that it is cut off from their mouth [210] We hence learn that
   their perfidy is condemned because they acted falsely; and as their
   heart was full of duplicity, so also was their tongue. He intimates, in
   short, that there was no hope as to their repentance; for had they
   promised a hundred times to God to be teachable and obedient, and
   shewed before the world any appearance of integrity, their promises
   would have passed off into mere fallacies and deceptions. He then adds
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [209] Our version is wrong, "obeyeth not;" for the charge against them
   is, that they did not attend or give ear to God's voice: they would not
   hear it any more than the Papists at this day. This is evident from the
   previous verse. -- Ed.

   [210] All the ancient versions and the Targum render 'mvghby pistis,
   fides -- faith, fidelity or faithfulness. The first verb, "perished" or
   lost, is omitted by the Septuagint and Arabic, but is retained by the
   Vulgate, Syriac, and the Targum. The second verb is stronger than the
   first; faithfulness was lost from the mouth, yea, it was completely
   separated from it. Lost is faithfulness, yea, wholly separated from the
   mouth.

   Jeremiah 7:29

   29. Cut off thine hair, O Jerusalem, and cast it away, and take up a
   lamentation on high places; for the LORD hath rejected and forsaken the
   generation of his wrath.

   29. Tonde comam tuam et projice et attolle super excelsa lamentationem;
   quid reprobavit (vel, vilipendit; sed verbum reprobandi magis placet
   hoc loco) Jehova, et reliquit aetatem indignationis suae.


   Here again Jeremiah exhorts his own people to lament; and he uses the
   feminine gender, as though he called the people, the daughter of Sion,
   or the daughter of Jerusalem. He then, according to a common mode of
   speaking, calls the whole people a woman. [211]

   He first bids her to shave off the hair The word nzr, nesar, means the
   hair, derived from the Nazarites, who allowed their hair to grow: and
   there may be here a striking allusion to the Nazarites who were sacred
   to God; as though he had said, "This people are profane, and therefore
   ought to have nothing in common with the Nazarites." Hence also is
   derived nzr, nesar, a crown. Though then the word means the hair, yet
   the allusion is not to be overlooked, -- that this people, rejected by
   God, are bidden to cut off and to throw away the hair. After the
   throwing away of the hair there was to be great lamentation; Raise, he
   says, on high places a lamentation This may seem to be an exhortation
   to repentance: but as we have seen elsewhere, though the prophets often
   gave the people the hope of pardon and reconciliation, yet in this
   place the Prophet no doubt denounces a final judgment, and is a herald
   of lamentation, because the prevailing impiety was irreclaimable. He
   does not then perform here the duty of a teacher, but in a hostile
   manner denounces ruin: for it immediately follows --

   For rejected hath Jehovah and forsaken the generation of his wrath The
   word dvr, dur, means an age, not time, but men of the same age: as we
   call that our generation which now lives in the world, and that which
   is dead the generation of our fathers, and what succeeds us the next
   generation. It is indeed true, that the Israelites in every age were
   worthy of a similar vengeance; but God no doubt shews here, that his
   vengeance was at hand, for he had long borne with the perverse conduct
   of the people, and suspended his judgment. As then vengeance was now to
   be executed, the Prophet calls that age the age of God's wrath; for we
   know that the genitive case in Hebrew has often such a meaning as this.
   Then the age of his wrath means the age or generation devoted to
   extreme vengeance; for their wickedness against God was extreme, as
   long as he treated them with forbearance. The longer then he had
   deferred his judgment, the heavier punishment was at hand. It
   afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [211] The emendations of Houbigant, adopted by Blayney, are by no means
   to be approved; for without the authority of any MSS. or versions, he
   changes the gender of these verbs in succession. It is a common thing
   in the prophets to call the people the daughter of Sion: and probably
   they are here so addressed, because the hair is an ornament to a
   female, and to cut it off is a token of deep distress. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 7:30

   30. For the children of Judah have done evil in my sight, saith the
   Lord: they have set their abominations in the house which is called by
   my name, to pollute it.

   30. Quoniam fecerunt filii Jehudah malum in oculis meis, dicit Jehova:
   posuerunt abominationes suas in domo, super quam invocatum est nomen
   meum, ad polluendam ipsam.


   Lest the Jews should murmur and complain that God was too rigorous, the
   Prophet adds, that they were not given up to destruction without the
   justest reasons. How so? They had done evil To do evil here means, that
   they had not offended in one thing, but had given themselves up to
   wickedness and evil doings. It is the same as though he had said, that
   they were so corrupt that they were wholly inured to the doing of evil,
   and had by long use contracted evil habits; for they continually
   provoked God. But as they flattered themselves, the Prophet reminds
   them here of God's judgment: "It is enough, "he says, "that the Judge
   condemns you; for if ye see not your wickedness nor acknowledge your
   sin, yet this will not avail you; for God declares that you are guilty
   in his sight."

   We see that there is an implied contrast between the sight of God and
   the delusions by which hypocrites soothed themselves, while they made
   evasions or perversely excused their sins, or sought to escape by
   circuitous windings. God then shews that his own sight, or knowledge,
   is sufficient, how blind soever man may be, and however the whole world
   may connive at their sins.

   He adds one kind of sin, that they had set up their abominations [212]
   in the Temple. This refers to superstitions. But as we have seen
   elsewhere, and shall often have to observe, the Prophets frequently
   reproved sins by mentioning only one sin for the whole. Then what was
   especially wicked in the people he states, and that was, that the
   Temple was polluted with superstitions. We have already said, that it
   was an intolerable sacrilege to pollute the Temple with abominations,
   which was then the only true Temple in the world: for it was God's will
   that sacrifices should be offered to him in that one place; and he had
   carefully described everything necessary for a right worship. When,
   therefore, the Jews polluted that very Temple, how abominable was such
   a profanation? It was not then without reason that the Prophet brings
   forward what was especially wicked in the people, -- that God's house
   was polluted with superstitious and many spurious ceremonies, and that
   there his whole worship was vitiated. The rest to-morrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [212] The word means what is unclean and filthy, "their filthy things."
   They were the idols which were introduced into the Temple. They did
   this evil "before his eyes," or in his presence, as the Temple was his
   habitation. They brought idols as it were into his very presence, and
   thereby literally violated the first commandment, which expressly
   forbad them to have other gods before him or in his presence. By what
   means did they evade this explicit command? In the same way as the
   Church of Rome justifies idolatry, -- that idols are helps to devotion:
   but God regards them as abominations. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou so constantly invitest us, daily
   and even hourly, to thyself, we may not give thee occasion to complain,
   as of thy people of old, that we are deaf and thus neglect thy holy
   admonitions, but that we may be teachable and submissive to thee, and
   that, as thou risest early, we may also be ready to meet thee, and be
   obedient to thee, not only for one day, but persevere through life in
   the same course, until at length we shall reach that blessed rest,
   prepared for us in heaven by Jesus Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 7:31

   31. And they have built the high places of Tophet, which is in the
   valley of the son of Hinnom, to burn their sons and their daughters in
   the fire; which I commanded them not, neither came it into my heart.

   31. Et aedificavit excelsa Topheth, quae in valle filii Hinnom, ut
   comburerent filios suos et filias suas igni; quod non mandavi, et non
   ascendit super cor meum.


   Jeremiah in this verse also inveighs against those superstitions by
   which the Jews had corrupted the true and pure worship of God. He says,
   that they had builded high places, which was prohibited in the law.
   (Leviticus 26:30.) Now God, as it has been before said, prefers
   obedience to all sacrifices, (1 Samuel 15:22:) hence the Prophet justly
   condemned them, that they forsook the Temple and built for themselves
   high places or groves, and also altars.

   He then mentions one particular place, even Tophet in the valley of
   Hinnom The prophets, in order to render the place detestable, no doubt
   designated the infernal regions by tpht, Tophet, and gy' hnm, gia enom.
   For when Isaiah speaks, in the thirtieth chapter, of the eternal
   punishment of the wicked, he mentions Tophet, which is the same word as
   we find here. As to the valley of Hinnom, it is called in Greek
   Gehenna, and is taken to designate eternal death, or the torments which
   await all the wicked. In a similar manner the word Paradise is
   metaphorically taken for the blessed state and for the eternal
   inheritance; for God so placed man at first in that eastern garden,
   that he might in a manner protect him under his own wings. As then the
   blessing and favor of God shone on that place where Adam first dwelt,
   that it might be a certain image of celestial life and of true
   happiness, so they called the glory, prepared for all God's children in
   heaven, Paradise. So also on the other hand the prophets called hell
   gy' hnm, gia enom, in order that the Jews might detest those impious
   and sacrilegious modes of worship by which their fathers had polluted
   themselves. And for the same reason they call hell, Tophet. The
   ancients also say, that it was a place in the suburbs of the city. They
   were not wont then to assemble afar off for the sake of these
   abominations, since the place was within sight of the Temple, and they
   knew that there was the only true altar approved by God, and that it
   was not lawful to offer sacrifices anywhere else. Since they knew this,
   and God had set such a place before their eyes, the greater was their
   madness, when they preferred a filthy spot in which to worship God
   according to their own will, or rather according to their own
   wantonness.

   Of this so great an audacity Jeremiah now complains: They builded for
   themselves high places, in Tophet, even in the valley He introduces the
   word son; but it is called hnm gy', gia enom, the valley of Hinnom;
   whence comes the word Gehenna, as we have already said.

   He adds, that they might burn their sons and their daughters It was a
   horrible and prodigious madness for parents not to spare their own
   children, but to cast them into the fire; for they must have been so
   seized with a diabolic fury as to divest themselves of all human
   feelings: and yet they had a plausible reason, as they supposed; for it
   was a zeal worthy of all praise to prefer God to their own children.
   When therefore they cast their children into the fire, this kind of
   zeal might have deceived the simple; and to this was added a pretext
   derived from example, for Abraham was prepared to sacrifice his own
   son. But it hence appears what men will do when they are led away by an
   inconsiderate zeal; for from the beginning of the world the source of
   all superstitions has been this, -- that men have devised for
   themselves various modes of worship, and have given themselves the
   liberty to seek a way of their own to pacify God.

   As to the pretended example, they were so blind as not to distinguish
   between themselves and Abraham; for he was commanded to offer his son,
   (Genesis 22:2;) but they, without any command, attempted to do the same
   thing; this was extreme presumption. As to Abraham, he obeyed God; and
   he could not have been led astray, when he knew that such a sacrifice
   was approved by God. But when the Jews emulated his zeal, it was an
   extreme folly; and they were especially culpable, because they
   neglected God's command and wholly disregarded it. They were, however,
   so far carried away by their own wantonness as to cast their own
   children into the fire, and under the pretense of piety: so great and
   so savage a cruelty prevailed among them. We hence perceive that there
   is no end of sinning, when men give themselves up to their own
   inventions; for God surrenders those to Satan, that they may be led by
   the spirit of giddiness and of madness and of stupidity. Let us
   therefore learn ever to regard what God approves: and let this be the
   very beginning of our inquiry, whenever we undertake anything, whether
   God commands it; and this course ought especially to be observed with
   regard to his worship; for, as it has been already stated, religion is
   especially founded on faith, and faith is based on the word of God: and
   hence it is here added --

   Which I commanded them not, and which never came to my mind This reason
   ought to be carefully noticed, for God here cuts off from men every
   occasion for making evasions, since he condemns by this one phrase, "I
   have not commanded them," whatever the Jews devised. There is then no
   other argument needed to condemn superstitions, than that they are not
   commanded by God: for when men allow themselves to worship God
   according to their own fancies, and attend not to his commands, they
   pervert true religion. And if this principle was adopted by the
   Papists, all those fictitious modes of worship, in which they absurdly
   exercise themselves, would fall to the ground. It is indeed a horrible
   thing for the Papists to seek to discharge their duties towards God by
   performing their own superstitions. There is an immense number of them,
   as it is well known, and as it manifestly appears. Were they to admit
   this principle, that we cannot rightly worship God except by obeying
   his word, they would be delivered from their deep abyss of error. The
   Prophet's words then are very important, when he says, that God had
   commanded no such thing, and that it never came to his mind; as though
   he had said, that men assume too much wisdom, when they devise what he
   never required, nay, what he never knew. It is indeed certain, that
   there was nothing hid from God, even before it was done: but God here
   assumes the character of man, as though he had said, that what the Jews
   devised was unknown to him, as his own law was sufficient.

   Now, as the words Tophet and Gehenna were so stigmatized by the
   prophets, we may hence learn how displeasing to God is every idolatry
   and profanation of his true and pure worship: for he compares these
   notorious places in which the Jews performed so sedulously their
   devotions, to the infernal regions. And hence at this day, when the
   Papists boast of what they call their devotions, we may justly say,
   that there are as many gates, through which they throw themselves
   headlong into hell, as there are modes of worship devised by them for
   the purpose of conciliating God. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 7:32

   32. Therefore, behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that it shall no
   more be called Tophet, nor the valley of the son of Hinnom, but the
   valley of slaughter: for they shall bury in Tophet, till there be no
   place.

   32. Propterea, Ecce dies veniunt, dicit Jehova, et non dicetur (hoc
   est, quibus non dicetur) Topheth et vallis filii Hinnom, sed vallis
   occisionis; et sepelient Topheth, quia non erit locus.


   The Prophet denounces a punishment, though the Jews thought that they
   deserved a reward. The case is the same with the Papists at this day,
   who thoughtlessly boast, when they heap together many abominations; for
   they think that God is bound as it were by a law, not to overlook so
   much diligence. But the Prophet shews how grossly deceived they are who
   worship God superstitiously, without the authority of his word; for he
   threatens them here with the heaviest judgment, -- Called no more, he
   says, shall it be Tophet, nor The valley of the son of Hinnom; but The
   valley of slaughter shall it be called; for the whole land was to be
   filled with slaughters.

   He adds, Bury shall they there, for elsewhere there will be no place
   [213] He intimates that so great would be the slaughters, that
   Jerusalem would not contain the dead: hence, he says, graves will be
   made in Tophet; and many also will be slain there. A dead body, we
   know, was unclean by the Law; and it was not lawful to offer sacrifices
   to God near graves. (Numbers 19:11, 16.) The Prophet then shows, that
   when the Jews foolishly consecrated that place to God, they committed a
   dreadful profanation, for that place was to be wholly filled with dead
   bodies, and polluted also by the slaughter of men. We hence see what
   the superstitious do when they follow their own devices -- that they
   provoke God's wrath; for by the grievousness of the punishment we may
   form a judgment as to the degree in which God abominates all false
   modes of worship, which men devise without the warrant of his law; for
   we must ever remember this principle, I commanded it not, nor hath it
   ever come to my mind It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [213] This is the meaning according to all the ancient versions and the
   Targum. The Syriac is, "for want of place." Gataker gives the same
   meaning. Our version follows Pagninus, and is substantially adopted by
   Blayney both here and in Jeremiah 19:11. Literally it is, "From no
   place," that is, "From there being no place," as Calvin says elsewhere.
   -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 7:33

   33. And the carcases of this people shall be meat for the fowls of the
   heaven, and for the beasts of the earth; and none shall fray them away.

   33. Et erit cadaver populi hujus in cibum avi coelorum (avibus) et
   bestiae terrae (hoc est, bestiis) nec erit qui absterreat (hoc est, qui
   terrore abigat.)


   Jeremiah threatens them with something more grievous than death itself,
   -- that God would impress the marks of his wrath even on their dead
   bodies. It is indeed true what a heathen poet says,

   "That the loss of a grave is not great," (Virgil, aeneid;)

   but we must on the other hand remember that burying has been held as a
   sacred custom in all ages; for it was a symbol of the last
   resurrection. Barbarous then were the words, "Give me a stick, if you
   fear that birds will eat my dead body;" as the cynic, who had ordered
   his body to be cast into the field, derided what was said in answer to
   him, "The wild beasts and birds will devour thee:" "Oh," said he, "let
   me have a stick, and I will drive them away;" intimating by such a
   saying, that he would then be without any feeling; but he shewed that
   he entertained no hope of immortality. But it was God's will that the
   custom of burying should prevail among all nations, that in death
   itself there might be some evidence or intimation of the last
   resurrection. When therefore the Prophet declares here and in other
   places that the Jews would be without a burial, he doubtless enhances
   the vengeance of God.

   We indeed know that some of the most holy men had not been buried; for
   the prophets were sometimes exposed to wild beasts and birds: and the
   whole Church complains in Psalm 79:2, that the dead bodies of the
   saints were exposed and became food for birds and wild beasts. This has
   sometimes happened; for God often mixes the good with the evil in
   temporal punishments, as he makes his sun to rise on the good and the
   evil: but yet of itself and for the most part, it is an evidence of a
   curse, when a man's body is cast away without any burial.

   It is this then that the Prophet means when he says, The carcase of
   this people shall be meat for the birds of the air and for the beasts
   of the earth, and there will be none to terrify them; [214] that is,
   there will be no one to perform the humane office of driving the beasts
   away, the very thing which nature itself would lead one to do. If any
   one now objects and says, that in this case the faithful could not be
   distinguished from the reprobate, the answer is plainly this, -- that
   when the honor of a burial is denied to the faithful, God will become
   the avenger. But this does not prove that God does not in this way
   inflict a visible punishment on the reprobate, and thus expose them to
   reproach by whom he has been despised. He afterwards adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [214] The poetical singular is used throughout the verse, -- And the
   carcase of this people shall be for meat
   To the bird of heaven and to the beast of the earth,
   And there will be no terrifier. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 7:34

   34. Then will I cause to cease from the cities of Judah, and from the
   streets of Jerusalem, the voice of mirth, and the voice of gladness,
   the voice of the bridegroom, and the voice of the bride: for the land
   shall be desolate.

   34. Et cessare faciam ex urbibus Jehudah et ex compitis Jerusalem vocem
   gaudii et vocem laetitiae, vocem sponsi et vocem sponsae; quia in
   vastitatem erit (hoc est, redigetur) terra.


   He still continues the same subject; for he denounces on the Jews the
   punishment which they had deserved. He more fully expresses what he
   mentioned in the last verse respecting the shameful and dreadful
   barbarity that would follow the slaughter; for the whole country would
   not only be harassed by the enemy, but wholly laid waste: for when
   sounds of joy and gladness cease, all places are filled with
   lamentations; and when no marriages are celebrated, it is a sign of
   devastation.

   But by marriage, the Prophet, stating a part for the whole, understands
   whatever was necessary for the preservation of society; it is the same
   as though he had said, "There shall be now no marrying:" for without
   marriages the human race cannot continue. Hence this cessation would be
   the same, as though he had said, that they would be wholly regardless
   of all those things necessary to perpetuate mankind. He thus adds
   nothing new, but expands what we have before observed, -- that the
   whole land would be filled with dead bodies, and that there would be
   such lamentation as to deter men from all their usual and ordinary
   habits: he afterwards shews more fully the same thing.

   Jeremiah 8:1-2

   1. At that time, saith the Lord, they shall bring out the bones of the
   kings of Judah, and the bones of his princes, and the bones of the
   priests, and the bones of the prophets, and the bones of the
   inhabitants of Jerusalem, out of their graves:

   1. In die illo, dicit Jehova, extrahent ossa regum Jehudah et ossa
   principum ejus, et ossa sacerdotum, et ossa prophetarum, et ossa civium
   Jerosolymae (habitantium,) e sepulchris suis;

   2. And they shall spread them before the sun, and the moon, and all the
   host of heaven, whom they have loved, and whom they have served, and
   after whom they have walked, and whom they have sought, and whom they
   have worshipped: they shall not be gathered, nor be buried; they shall
   be for dung upon the face of the earth.

   2. Et expendent coram sole et luna et toto exercitu coelorum, quae
   dilexerunt (nam relativum neutrum comprehendit et solem et lunam et
   exercitum; vel, si magis placeat vertere, quos exercitus dilexerunt,)
   et quibus servierunt, et post quos ambularunt, et quos quaesierunt, et
   coram quibus prostrati sunt (hoc est, se inclinarunt;) neque
   colligentur, et non sepelientur, in stercus in terrae superficie erunt.


   I Have said that Jeremiah repeats in the first verse what he had before
   said, -- that the Jews would be deprived of their graves, in order that
   there might be on the dead a mark of God's vengeance; as though he had
   said, that after having been destroyed by the hand of enemies, they
   would have their punishment extended farther by having their dead
   bodies exposed to the wild beasts and birds. The faithful, as I have
   said, suffer no loss, when burial is denied them; but yet they do not
   disregard burial, inasmuch as it is a badge of the resurrection. Though
   God suffers them to be involved in this disgrace with the reprobate,
   yet this does not hinder but that God should execute his vengeance on
   the wicked by such a temporal punishment as turns to a blessing to the
   faithful. It is therefore no unmeaning denunciation, when the Prophet
   says that the time was at hand, when their bones would be taken out of
   their graves.

   He mentions the bones of kings, and of priests, and of prophets, and of
   the whole people The kings thought that as soon as they were hid in
   their graves, their dead bodies would be deemed sacred: the same notion
   prevailed as to rulers, priests, and prophets: but he says that no
   grave would be untouched or free from the outrage of enemies; and thus
   he shews, that the city would be rooted up from its foundations. Were
   the city to remain safe, the graves would be spared. Hence this
   punishment could not have been inflicted, without the very foundations
   of the city being dug up by the enemies. In short, he points out here a
   dreadful and final overthrow; and at the same time he shews the reason
   why God would manifest such severity towards the Jews.

   It was, because they served the sun, and the moon, and the stars It was
   God's just vengeance, that their bones should be taken from their
   graves, in order that the sun and moon and all the stars might be
   witnesses of his judgment. By these words Jeremiah indirectly
   reprobates the senselessness of the people for thinking that they
   performed an acceptable service to the sun and moon. He therefore says,
   that all the stars and the planets would become as it were spectators
   of the vengeance which God would execute; as though he had said, that
   the whole celestial host would approve of that punishment; for nothing
   is more detestable to creatures, than when the glory of their Maker is
   ascribed to them. It is indeed true that the sun, moon, and stars are
   without sense or reason; but the Prophet here attributes reason to
   them, in order that he might shake off from the Jews that stupidity in
   which they hardened themselves, while they thought that they were
   rendering to the sun an acceptable service. At the same time he
   alludes, as it appears also from other places, to the punishment
   inflicted on adulterers: for when a harlot is drawn out and led forth
   in contempt and disgrace in the presence of her adulterers, it is
   deemed a most just punishment. And thus as the Jews had as it were
   committed adultery with the sun and the moon and the stars, so the
   Prophet says here, that their disgrace and baseness would be made
   manifest in the sight of the sun, and the moon, and the stars.

   He says, which they have loved He no doubt alludes to the blind ardor
   by which idolaters were possessed, when they zealously pursued their
   illicit devotions; for it was a species of an unbridled and mad
   passion, as it appears from other places; for no fornicator burns with
   a more impetuous lust after a woman, than idolaters do, when Satan
   dazzles their eyes and fascinates their hearts. Of this impure love
   then does the Prophet now speak; and at the same time, he indirectly
   condemns the Jews for having alienated themselves without a cause from
   God, who was their legitimate husband. There is indeed nothing less
   tolerable than for men thus perfidiously to forsake God, when he has
   invited them to himself, and contracted as it were with them a holy and
   an inviolable marriage.

   He afterwards adds, whom they have served This was still more base;
   they devoted themselves to the work of serving the sun, the moon, and
   the stars. He mentions in the third place, that they walked after them.
   God had shewn them the right way, and had commanded them to follow him:
   but they forsook God, says the Prophet, and followed the stars of
   heaven. He states in the fourth place, that they sought them. By this
   he refers to their perverseness. Some render the word "consulted," of
   which I do not approve, for it is strained and far-fetched. [215] The
   Prophet, I doubt not, denotes here the persevering attention of the
   Jews to the objects of their worship; for they followed their idols not
   by a sudden and momentary impulse, but they resolutely devoted
   themselves to them and became as it were fixed in their wicked purpose.
   And he says in the last place, that they prostrated themselves before
   them. This was the way in which they served them. It is an evidence of
   reverence when men prostrate themselves before their idols; and thus
   they serve them, for it is an act of worship. The Prophet might indeed
   have sufficiently expressed in one sentence the impiety of the people;
   but he joins together several sentences for the sake of amplification,
   in order that he might render more evident the ingratitude of the
   people in seeking for themselves unknown gods, and in setting up false
   and fictitious modes of worship, rather than to render obedience to the
   only true God and to acquiesce in his law, which is a certain rule, and
   never leads any astray. [216]

   He afterwards adds, They shall not be gathered, nor be buried; for dung
   shall they be on the face or surface of the land He confirms what he
   had said of the punishment before mentioned, -- that they had acted
   disdainfully towards God, and had prostrated themselves before their
   idols, so after death they would be made base and detestable, so that
   the mind would revolt at such a hateful sight. This is the meaning. It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [215] Though it be improper to render the word "consult;" yet the
   meaning is the same: they sought them, that is, their counsel and
   direction. They sought them in all emergencies. "To inquire of the
   Lord," in Genesis 25:22, is literally "to seek the Lord;" and "to
   inquire of God," in Exodus 18:15, is literally "to seek God." Indeed,
   to inquire of or to ask, that is, counsel, seems to be the most common
   meaning of the word. "Sought," is the Vulgate and Targum, --
   "consulted," is the Syriac, -- and "cleaved to," is the Septuagint and
   Arabic; and this is the idea of Calvin. -- Ed.

   [216] It would be better to render 'mvnhbefore the verbs here as an
   adverb, because, as, or inasmuch as. There is a pronoun following every
   verb, -- 2. And they shall expose them to the sun, And to the moon, and
   to all the host of heaven: As they had loved them, and as they had
   served them, And as they had walked after them, And as they had sought
   them, And as they had bowed down to them, They shall not be gathered,
   nor buried; For dung on the face of the land shall they be. The order
   here is from the principle to the action, and not the contrary, as is
   often the case: love -- service -- walking according to the rules
   prescribed -- seeking counsel-and worshipping. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 8:3

   3. And death shall be chosen rather than life by all the residue of
   them that remain of this evil family, which remain in all the places
   whither I have driven them, saith the Lord of hosts.

   3. Et eligetur (ad verbum esset, electa est) mors (sed debet resolvi in
   futurum tempus) prae vita ab omnibus reliquiis, quae residuae erunt ab
   hac prava natione (a natione hac mala) in omnibus locis ubi residui
   fuerint, ad quae expulero eos (ad quae illuc; sed sm, est supervacuum,)
   dicit Jehova exercituum.


   He intimates in this verse, that all survivors would be doubly
   miserable, as it would be better for them to die at once than to pine
   away in unceasing evils: for they who give another meaning to the
   words, seem not to understand the design of the Prophet. The import
   then of the passage is, -- that however dreadful God's judgment would
   be, when slaughters everywhere prevailed, and dead bodies were drawn
   out which had been previously buried, yet all this would be a slight
   punishment in comparison with what God would inflict on the rest, such
   as remained alive: and he also intimates that their life would be more
   miserable than death itself, yea, than ten deaths.

   That those then who would escape death might not think that they gained
   any advantage, the Prophet says, Chosen shall be death before life by
   all the residue We hence learn how grievous was to be God's vengeance;
   for nothing would be better or more desirable than to undergo death at
   once, as life would be nothing else but a continued languor and
   torment. Expected then will be death in all places in which there shall
   be survivors, where I shall drive them He mentions a reason for this
   twofold misery, -- they would not be allowed to live in their own
   country, but would become aliens, -- and they would find in their exile
   God's hand against them, and as it were following them everywhere.
   [217]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [217] The literal rendering of this verse is as follows, -- And chosen
   shall be death rather than life by all the remnant, -- Who shall remain
   of this wicked family, In all the places of such as shall remain,
   Whither I shall have driven them, Saith Jehovah of hosts. Blayney
   justly observes, that the participle in the second line is in
   apposition with "remnant," as explanatory of it, and is not to be put
   in the genitive case, as in our version. A similar construction is
   found in Jeremiah 24:8. But there is no sufficient authority or reason
   for omitting the same participle after "places," as is done by Blayney.
   Such repetitions are common in the prophets. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou terrifiest us daily with thy
   judgments, and as it is needful for our sloth to be stimulated, and for
   our corruption to be thus corrected, -- O grant, that we may be moved
   by thy threatenings, and at the same time suffer ourselves to be kindly
   invited by thee, and make such progress in thy word, that, being
   terrified by threatenings, we may also readily and willingly obey
   whenever thou in a paternal manner callest us to thyself, and labor in
   every way to devote ourselves wholly to thee, by subduing the corrupt
   affections of our flesh, so that nothing may hinder us to be submissive
   to thy will, until we shall at length enjoy the rest of that eternal
   inheritance, which thou hast promised to us in Christ Jesus our Lord.
   -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 8:4-5

   4. Moreover thou shalt say unto them, Thus saith the LORD; Shall they
   fall, and not arise? shall he turn away, and not return?

   4. Et dices ad eos, Sic dicit Jehova, An qui ceciderunt non resurgent?
   si quis aversus fuerit non revertetur?

   5. Why then is this people of Jerusalem slidden back by a perpetual
   backsliding? they hold fast deceit, they refuse to return.

   5. Quare rebellis est populus hic Jerosolymae rebellione perpetua?
   (forti, ad verbum;) adhaeserunt fraudi (vel, apprehenderunt fraudem,)
   noluerunt reverti.


   Though God had reminded his Prophet of the event, yet he still invites
   the Jews to repentance; not that there was any hope of restoring them
   to a right mind, (for he had said that they were wholly irreclaimable,)
   but that their perverseness might be less excusable; and it was also
   his object to afford some relief to the small number of the godly who
   still remained; for they had not all fallen away into impiety, though
   the great body of the people had become corrupt. God then, partly to
   aggravate the sin of the ungodly, and partly to provide for his
   faithful people, exhorts those to repentance, who were yet wholly
   intractable. And here we ought to consider that God's goodness, when
   abused, brings a much heavier judgment. God does here in a manner
   contend with the wickedness of his people, by setting before them the
   hope of pardon, if they repented.

   Thou shalt then say to them; that is, "Though I have already testified
   to thee that thy labor would be in vain, yet thou shalt not give over
   thy work." Shall they who have fallen rise again? This sentence is
   variously explained; the greater part of interpreters confine it to the
   Jews only, "Shall the Jews who have fallen rise again?" As to the
   second clause, some give this explanation, "If Israel returns, will not
   God also return?" that is, from his wrath, or, "Will he not be
   propitious?" Or, "If Israel turns away, will not God also turn away?"
   Others understand both parts of the sentence of the people, "If the
   people have once turned away, will they not yet return to God?" For the
   verb svv, shub, has contrary meanings; it means, to fall away, to
   rebel, to go back; and it means also to return. But after having
   maturely considered the words and the design of the Prophet, I think it
   to be a general statement, as though he had said, "When any one falls,
   he immediately thinks of recovering his fall; when any one deviates
   from the right course, being warned of his going astray, he immediately
   looks for the road. This is what is usually done, what then means this
   so great a stupidity, that the people of Jerusalem do not repent, when
   yet they ought to have long ago acknowledged their fall and their
   wanderings?"

   Whoever will impartially consider the discourse of the Prophet must see
   that this is the real meaning; for, in the second of these verses, he
   says, Why is this people of Jerusalem, etc.; he now first speaks, as it
   clearly appears, of the people. It then follows that the former verse
   ought not to be applied to the people; but it contains only a general
   statement. In short, Jeremiah condemns here the madness of the people,
   because they followed not the example of those who have either fallen
   or deviated from the way by mistake. For it is what is naturally
   implanted in all, that they do not willingly perish in their
   misfortunes. He then who falls immediately strives to rise again; and
   he who leaves the right way, tries if possible to return to it again.
   This then is what the most foolish will do; why then, says Jeremiah, do
   not this people imitate such an example? He therefore shews by this
   comparison, that their conduct was monstrous; for they obstinately
   adhered to their vices, and never thought that there was a hope of
   reconciliation if they from the heart returned unto God. And he
   emphatically mentions Jerusalem; for had such obstinacy prevailed among
   the Chaldeans or the Egyptians, it would indeed have been inexcusable;
   but not so strange as among a people to whom the law had been given,
   and to whom God had plainly revealed the way of salvation. When,
   therefore, this people so hardened themselves as to reject all
   warnings, was it not monstrous? [218]

   Then he says, that they were rebellious with a pertinacious rebellion;
   that is, that they forsook God not only through levity or want of
   thought, or some sudden impulse, but so pertinaciously, that the
   prophets spent their labor in vain in teaching and exhorting them.
   Hence he calls it a strong rebellion, though the word may be taken here
   as in other places in the sense of perpetual And he assigns the cause,
   because they laid hold on deception, that is, they adhered fast to
   deception. But the Prophet means by deception, not that by which a
   neighbor is deceived or circumvented, but hypocrisy, by which men so
   blind themselves, that they are unwilling either to attend to God's
   word, or to open their eyes to see the light. When, therefore, men
   through willful obstinacy bury themselves in darkness, they may be said
   to lay fast hold on deception [219]

   David says, in Psalm 32:2, that the man is blessed in whose spirit
   there is no guile: he entertains no guile, as we commonly do. Now, to
   entertain guile is to possess a deceitful heart. He had before said
   that they are blessed whose sins are forgiven and to whom iniquity is
   not imputed: he adds by way of explanation, provided there be no guile
   in the spirit; and why? Because wicked men seem to themselves to be
   blessed, for they perceive not their own misery, because they are
   enveloped in their own coverings: and this is the guile of which David
   speaks. According to the same meaning, our Prophet says, that those
   laid fast hold on deception, who were so involved in darkness or so
   blinded by their lusts, as to seek to deceive God; but they deceive
   themselves. This then is the cause why those whom God corrects and
   chastises feel no penitence; for they are willfully blind, they close
   their eyes and deafen their ears, and seek to be deceived by the devil;
   they attend not to the holy warnings given them for their salvation. If
   then, we wish to be healed of our vices, let us ever begin in this way,
   -- let us carefully examine our thoughts and our motives, and not
   please ourselves nor deceive ourselves by empty flatteries, but strive
   to shake off whatever is reprehensible and vicious. The very beginning
   of true repentance is to renounce all deceptions and fallacies and to
   seek the light, which can alone discover to us our evils. It afterwards
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [218] Most agree in this view,-Gataker, Venema, Henry, Lowth, Blayney,
   and Scott. All the versions favor this view, giving two different
   meanings to svv, repeated in the last clause, except the Syriac, which
   gives this version, "Though they ought to repent, they yet do not
   repent." -- Ed

   [219] The idea of revolt or apostasy is given by the ancient versions
   to the verb used at the beginning of the verse, and also to the noun
   which follows, and not that of rebellion, as by Calvin. The same
   meaning is given by Gataker, Venema, and Blayney; and they consider
   that Jerusalem is in apposition with "this people," in this manner, --
   Why has this people, Jerusalem, Revolted with perpetual revolt? As it
   has been already observed, the verb svv, with all its derivations,
   means strictly to turn, but is used in the sense of turning to or from,
   that is, of returning or of departing. The context is our guide. It can
   hardly be supposed to have these two meanings in the same passage. All
   agree in giving it the idea of returning, at the end of the fourth
   verse, and at the end of this verse, the fifth; and in the three other
   instances in which it occurs here, they give it the idea of turning
   away or departing. I am disposed to think that it has the first meaning
   throughout the passage. I would render these two verses thus, -- 4.
   Thou shalt also say to them, Thus saith Jehovah, -- Do men fall and not
   rise again? Does any one return and not return? -- 5. Why, -- often
   have this people returned, Jerusalem is returning continually! -- They
   hold fast deceit, they have refused to return. The hypocrisy of the
   people is the subject: they pretended to return, but did not really
   return; they were deceitful. It is a sort of a dialogue. The beginning
   of the next verse is an answer to the end of this, -- 6. I hearkened
   and heard, "No:" thus they say: Yet no man has repented of his evil, --
   Saying, What have I done? Every one returns to his own course, Like a
   horse rushing into battle. The charge of refusing to return was
   negatived. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 8:6

   6. I hearkened and heard, but they spake not aright: no man repented
   him of his wickedness, saying, What have I done? every one turned to
   his course, as the horse rusheth into the battle.

   6. Attendi et audivi, non loquentur recte; nemo est quem poeniteat (ad
   verbum, non vir poenitens super malo suo; sed sensus clarior est, nemo
   est quem poeniteat) malitiae suae, dicendo, Quid feci? omnis vertitur
   (ad verbum pro omnes vertuntur) ad cursos suos, sicut equus ruit (ad
   verbum, inundat; sed metaphorica est locutio; Sicut ergo equus praeceps
   ruit) in praelium.


   These words may be considered as spoken by God himself, -- that he from
   heaven examined the state of the people; but it is more suitable to
   regard them as spoken by the Prophet; for he was placed, as it were, in
   a watch -- tower in order to observe how the people acted towards God.
   He now testifies, that having seen their pursuits and their doings, he
   saw nothing that was right. The people ought to have been more touched
   by these words. We indeed know how ready we are naturally to lay hold
   on any pretences, when we wish to continue quiet in our dregs. So the
   greater part are wont to object and say, "O, indeed, thou reprovest me,
   but inconsiderately; for thou knowest not what is in my heart." Hence
   the Prophet says, that he had carefully examined what sort of people
   they were, and that he spoke of what was well known to him, and fully
   seen by him, --

   I have heard, he says, and attended; but they speak not rightly He
   means, that so far were the Jews from repenting truly and sincerely,
   that they did not even with their mouths profess to do so. It is less
   to confess sins than really to amend; but the Prophet says, that they
   did not even say what was right. It hence follows, that they were very
   far from having any serious thoughts of repentance, since they were so
   wanton with their tongues, or at least afforded no evidence of sorrow.

   He then adds, that there was no one who repented, saying, etc. This
   clause is explanatory, for Jeremiah proves here more clearly that they
   did not speak rightly, for they did not say, What have I done? But he
   says first, that there was no one who repented of his wickedness He
   afterwards shews, that what is first necessary for repentance is, that
   the sinner should call himself to an account; for as long as we rest
   secure in our sins, it is impossible for us to repent, It is hence
   necessary that every one should examine himself, so as to call himself
   to an account, and in a manner to summon himself before God's tribunal.
   We then see that men can never be brought to repentance, except they
   set their own evils before their eyes, so as to feel ashamed, and to
   ask themselves, as it were in great fear, What have we done? for this
   question is an evidence of terror. Many, we know, formally own their
   sins; but this is useless, for afterwards such an acknowledgement
   vanishes without producing any benefit. Then real repentance
   necessarily requires that the sinner should not only be displeased with
   himself, should not only be ashamed, but that he should also be filled
   with terror at his own sins; for this is what is meant by the inquiry,
   What have I done? for it implies astonishment.

   We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet's words: he says, that he
   did not inconsiderately reprove the people, but that he found such
   perversity in them that no one spoke rightly, that no one repented,
   because they did not consider what they were, nor examined their own
   lives, but slept securely in their sins.

   He pursues the same subject when he says, that all turned to their own
   courses, that is, to their own lusts. But by the word "courses" the
   Prophet means impetuous movements; as though he had said, that the Jews
   were so precipitant in following their lusts, that they in a manner ran
   headlong after them; and he compares them to horses rushing into
   battle. We know with what impetuosity horses advance when they hasten
   to battle; for they seem to fly, to cut the air, and to dig the ground
   with their hoofs. Thus the comparison is exceedingly suitable, when the
   Prophet says that the Jews were so impetuous in pursuing their lusts,
   that they rushed on, not less precipitantly than war -- horses when
   advancing to battle. It now follows --

   Jeremiah 8:7

   7. Yea, the stork in the heaven knoweth her appointed times; and the
   turtle and the crane and the swallow observe the time of their coming;
   but my people know not the judgment of the LORD.

   7. Etiam ciconia in coelis cognoscit tempora sua, et turtur et hirundo
   (alii vertunt, picam; sed nomen hirundinis est aptius, quemadmodem
   statim patebit,) et grues observant tempus itineris; populus autem meus
   non cognoscit judicium Jehovae.


   Here again Jeremiah condemns the shameful insensibility of the people,
   -- that they had less wisdom than birds, not endued with reason and
   understanding. He then says, that the Jews were more foolish than
   cranes, swallows, and storks. He no doubt deeply wounded the feelings
   of the people by so severe a reproof; but it was necessary thus sharply
   to reprehend the despisers of God; for it appears evident by these
   words, that they were become exceedingly hardened in their vices. No
   wonder, then, that the Prophet declares that they were more silly than
   cranes and swallows. Isaiah also exposes the same sort of madness, when
   he says that the ox knew his own master, and the ass his master's crib,
   but that God was not known by his people. (Isaiah 1:3.) Now Isaiah made
   the Jews worse than oxen and asses, because these brute animals possess
   something like memory, so that they keep to their own manger and crib.
   So now Jeremiah, speaking of storks, etc., says, --

   Behold, the stork knows the time in which it ought to migrate from one
   country to another; and the same is observed by swallows and cranes
   [220] For at stated times they seek a warmer climate; that is, they
   leave a cold country, that they may escape the severity of winter; and
   they afterwards know the time in which they are to return. As, then,
   the birds of the air observe their seasons, how is it that my people do
   not consider the judgment of God? By mentioning the heavens, he no
   doubt alludes to the constant flying of birds, the birds having hardly
   any rest, for they continually rove through the air. Since, then, there
   is so much wisdom in birds, which yet the air wafts here and there, how
   comes it, that a people, who dwell quietly at home, who can leisurely
   meditate on God's law -- how comes it that this people understand
   nothing? We hence see that there is an import in the word heavens which
   has not been noticed. Readers may yet have their doubts; for it is
   nothing strange that birds in the heavens should have a clearer view,
   as they come nearer the sun and the element of fire: but different
   seems to have been the Prophet's object; which was to shew, that though
   birds labor as it were continually, they yet contrive to know the
   suitable time for going and returning. Hence, then, is exaggerated more
   fully the insensibility of that people, who, while sitting leisurely at
   home, did not consider what God did set before them.

   The particle gm, gam, even, is emphatical; Even the stork, he says.
   What means this, that birds, though not possessed of understanding, do
   yet know their time? But my people, etc. By saying "my people, "the
   Prophet no doubt intended more clearly to set forth their wickedness.
   For, as I have before said, such blindness in heathens would not have
   been so strange; but as they were the holy and peculiar people of God,
   it was far more shameful and monstrous that they knew not his judgment.

   Christ uses other words in condemning the Pharisees for not attending
   to the time of their visitation; for he says, "Ye are wont to conclude
   what will be the state of the heavens in the morning; for if the sky be
   red in the evening, ye say, It will be fine to -- morrow; and ye know
   the signs of future and approaching rain: ye possess, he says, judgment
   sufficiently acute in external things, which conduce to the benefit of
   the present life; yet ye know not the time of your visitation, and
   still ye seek signs: but were ye attentive, God would shew to you in a
   way clear enough, and as it were by the finger, that the time of
   deliverance which ye pretend to expect is now nigh at hand." But the
   Prophet reproves the Jews in a severer strain, when he says that there
   was more fatuity and madness in them than in birds. They know not, he
   says, the judgment of Jehovah, though it had been shewn to them many
   times, and for a long season.

   But some one might have objected and said, "No wonder if we perceive
   not God's judgment, for his judgments are a great deep; and since these
   exceed what we can comprehend, there is no reason to find fault with
   us." But the Prophet speaks not here of hidden judgments, which elude
   the comprehension of men, but of punishments, of which they had been so
   often warned. Since, then, they were so blind as not to see what was
   clear and evident, the Prophet justly says that they were more foolish
   than cranes, and the other birds which he mentions. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [220] It is curious the variety as to the names of birds in this verse,
   as given in the ancient versions: Vulgate; kite -- turtle -- swallow --
   stork; Septuagint, stork -- turtle -- swallow -- sparrows; Syriac,
   stork -- turtle -- crane -- swallow; Arabic, crane -- turtle -- swallow
   -- birds; and the Targum is, stork -- turtle -- crane -- swallow. The
   names in our versions seem to be the most correct, and are adopted by
   Venema and Blayney, stork -- turtle -- crane -- swallow; the same with
   the Syriac and the Targum -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 8:8

   8. How do ye say, We are wise, and the law of the Lord is with us? Lo,
   certainly in vain made he it; the pen of the scribes is in vain.

   8. Quomodo dicetis (pro dicitis; significat continuum actum) sapientes
   nos (hoc est, nos sumus sapientes,) et lex Jehovae nobiscum est (vel,
   penes nos, melius:) certe ecce frustra aptavit stylum (vel, calamum)
   scriptor; frustra sunt seribae.


   Interpreters think that the Prophet here directs his words to the
   priests, and the false prophets, and the other chiefs of the people,
   because they proudly arrogated to themselves the knowledge of the law:
   but what is said may be no less extended to the whole people; for, as
   we shall presently see, all of them, from the least to the greatest, no
   doubt boasted that they were sufficiently wise. I hence think that the
   Prophet here inveighs against the whole body of the people; for all,
   almost without exception, rejected his teaching, as we see also to be
   done at the present day; for who is there that can bear to be
   admonished and reproved? All say that they are wise enough: "Oh! do you
   think that I am a child?" or, as it is commonly said, "Do you think
   that I am a goose? I know how I am to live, and I am not without
   reason." Thus the rudest and the most ignorant set up their own wisdom
   and sharpness of wit against God and his prophets. Such audacity and
   ferociousness prevailed no doubt in the time of Jeremiah. For when he
   sharply reproved them, they were ready with their answer, -- "Oh! thou
   treatest us as though we were barbarians, as though God's law was
   unknown to us, as though we had not been taught from our childhood how
   we are to live: does not God dwell in the midst of us?" Since, then,
   the Jews did set up as it were this shield against the doctrine of the
   Prophet, he attacks them here with great vehemence, --

   How say ye, We are wise? He afterwards describes the kind of wisdom
   which they claimed, The law of God is with us: and doubtless, to attend
   to God's law is the way of becoming really wise. Had they justly
   boasted that they had the law, the Prophet would not have brought
   against them the charge, that they were doubly foolish. But as they
   falsely made this pretense, he says to them, How? and here he asks a
   question as to what was very strange, "How are you so foolish, "he
   says, "that ye think yourselves wise, as though the law of God were
   with you? Surely, if so, in vain has the law been written; for ye shew
   by your whole life that you have never known anything of what God by
   the law commands and sets before us, and what the design of it is."

   Thus Jeremiah shows by their life that there was no ground for their
   foolish boasting; for they gave no evidence of their wisdom. It is
   indeed necessary for those who seek to be God's disciples to bring
   forth some fruit: but as there was among them so much impiety, so much
   contempt of God, and as, in short, their whole life proclaimed them to
   be wholly insane, he says, In vain has he prepared his pen, even the
   writer of the law; and in vain have been the scribes, that is, the
   teachers; for by scribes, in the second place, he understands teachers.
   [221]

   I explain this passage somewhat different from other interpreters; for
   there seems to be implied a kind of irony, as we commonly say, Il faut
   bruler tous les livres. Hence Jeremiah derides their folly, in saying
   that they knew how they were to live, because the teaching of the law
   prevailed among them. "If it be so, "he says, "what is God's law?
   Doubtless, nothing, as the whole of its teaching must in this way be
   deemed as nothing." We now then see that the Jews are here reproved as
   false, for they claimed the law, as though it were a shadow without a
   body, and possessed not a particle of right knowledge. He afterwards
   adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [221] The latter part of this verse has another meaning according to
   the ancient versions. They are substantially to this purport, --
   Behold, surely to deceive is what the false pen of the scribes has
   done. The Vulgate, with which the rest materially agree, is as follows,
   -- Verily, falsehood has the false pen of the scribes wrought. As a
   proof of this it is added in the next verse, that those who pretended
   to be wise were made ashamed, etc. That the reference is made to the
   false glosses of the scribes, the expounders of the law, is confirmed
   by verse 11. I render the whole verse thus, -- 8. How can ye say, "Wise
   are we, And the law of Jehovah is with us?" Indeed! -- Behold, to
   deceive Has the deceptive pen of the scribes served. He ironically
   admits that they had the law; but he refers to the false interpretation
   of the teachers; and in the next verse he mentions the effect on the
   pretended wise, and the fact as to God's law, -- 9. Ashamed have become
   the wise, They have been dismayed and ensnared: Behold, the word of
   Jehovah have they despised; And wisdom, what have they! -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 8:9

   9. The wise men are ashamed, they are dismayed and taken: lo, they have
   rejected the word of the Lord; and what wisdom is in them?

   9. Pudefacti sunt sapientes, territi sunt et capti sunt (tcht
   significat proprie frangere, vel, conterere, sed transferter ad animum,
   et tunc significat terrere; dicit igitur esse territos, deinde
   illaqueatos; postea adjungit causam, nempe,) quia respuerunt in verbo
   (sed v est supervacuum, verbum ergo) Jehova (reprobarunt, vel
   repudiarunt,) et sapientia quid illis (prodest, subaudiunt quidam
   interpretes; alii vertunt, et quid est in ipsis sapientiae? Ego autem
   aliter accipio, ut statim dicam.)


   He says now that the wise were ashamed, and astonished, and ensnared By
   which words he means, that the Jews gained nothing by their craftiness,
   while they arrogated to themselves wisdom, and under this pretense
   rejected all admonitions, and sought to be spared.

   "This wisdom, "he says, "avails you nothing, for God, as it is said in
   another place, will take you unawares." (Isaiah 29:14; 1 Corinthians
   1:19.)

   Ashamed, then, he says, are they; not that they were then ashamed; for
   be said before, in Jeremiah 6:15, and will state the same presently,
   that they were so hardened that they could not be made ashamed, nor be
   made to blush: [222] but he here denounces a punishment, which was soon
   to overtake them; as though he had said, "Ye have now an iron front,
   and think that ye can elude God and his servants with impunity; but God
   will take you unawares, and will so shake off the masks under which you
   hide yourselves, that your disgrace shall be made manifest to all."
   This is the meaning.

   For the same purpose he says, "Ye are now secure, but God will shortly
   fill you with such terror, that he will make you greatly astonished "
   He intimates, then, that nothing would benefit them while they took
   delight in their vices, and increasingly hardened themselves; for God
   would deprive them of their craftiness, and cast them down with terror,
   however secure and perverse they were now.

   By the third word he sets forth the manner in which they would be
   treated: God would have his snares by which he would take them. He
   alludes to the subterfuges in which those hypocrites trust, who proudly
   oppose God, while they think that by their arts they can escape in this
   or that way, and often devise some new schemes by which they may
   deceive God. Hence the Prophet, alluding to their perverse cunning,
   says, that God would be as it were a fowler, who would ensnare them,
   and hold them captive.

   He afterwards assigns the reason, Because they had repudiated, or
   despised or rejected, [223] (for the verb means all these things,) the
   word of Jehovah And he uses a demonstrative particle, Behold, that they
   might not, as usual, make any evasions: "The thing, "he says, "is
   sufficiently known, and even children can be judges of your impiety,
   that you have rejected the word of Jehovah." He draws hence this
   inference, What does wisdom avail them? or, What is their wisdom?
   Either of these meanings may be admitted, They were wise to no purpose,
   while they provoked God by their impious contempt. "I hate the wise who
   is not wise for himself, "is an old proverb. As then the Jews ill
   consulted their own benefit, by rejecting the word of God, in which
   their safety was involved, the Prophet justly alleges, that their
   wisdom availed them nothing. Others read, "What is their wisdom, "when
   there is no fear of God? And doubtless it ever remains a truth, that
   the fear of God is the beginning and the chief part of wisdom.
   (Proverbs 1:7; Proverbs 9:10; Psalm 111:10.) Since then they had basely
   despised God's word, rightly does the Prophet ask, "What is their
   wisdom?" But there is a third meaning which is suitable, even this, And
   wisdom, what to them? So it is literally, -- What is wisdom to them? He
   still speaks to them ironically, as though he said, "They are indeed
   wise, but in their own esteem; they have therefore no need of being
   taught: What then is wisdom to them!" The meaning is, that they were so
   swollen with pride that they received no instruction. How so? They
   refused wisdom through the false conceit with which they were inflated.
   Let, however, every one choose for himself; my object is to shew what I
   mostly approve. There will be no lecture to -- morrow, as a consistory
   is to be held.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou ceasest not daily to rouse us, as
   also our sloth requires continual warnings, -- O grant, that we may not
   be unteachable, and that our perverseness may not hinder us to return
   immediately and willingly to thee, from whom we have, through our own
   fault, alienated ourselves: and may we not only feel some desire to
   repent, but persevere so constantly in the exercise of penitence, that
   through the whole course of our life we may contend with our lusts,
   until having at length subdued them all, we shall reach the goal which
   has been set before us, and enjoy in heaven that eternal inheritance,
   which has been procured for us by the blood of thine only -- begotten
   Son. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 8:10

   10. Therefore will I give their wives unto others, and their fields to
   them that shall inherit them: for every one from the least even unto
   the greatest is given to covetousness, from the prophet even unto the
   priest every one dealeth falsely.

   10. Propterea dabo uxores eorum alienis, et agros eorum possessoribus;
   quia a parvo usque ad magnum omnes cupiditatem concupiverunt (vel,
   cupiditate concupiverunt;) a propheta usque ad sacerdotem omnes egerunt
   fallaciter.


   GOD here threatens punishment, because he found that he effected
   nothing, and that he had to do with an obstinate people, having before
   tried whether they were reclaimable. Having seen that exhortations were
   of no avail, he now comes to extreme severity, I will give, he says,
   their wives to strangers. He sets forth, by a particular instance, the
   evils which usually accompany wars: and nothing is more distressing
   than when the wife is snatched away from her husband; for if husbands
   had their option, they would prefer instant death than to bear such a
   disgrace. Jeremiah then shews that the most atrocious thing that
   happens to conquered nations was nigh the Jews, -- that their men would
   be deprived of their wives. He afterwards says the same thing of their
   fields; God declares that he would give the fields to their possessors.
   By this mode of speaking he intimates, that they would be deprived of
   their fields, not for a short time, but perpetually.

   There is, indeed, a contrast here implied: for it sometimes happens,
   that enemies prevail and plunder everything; but yet they take no long
   possession of the fields, for a change succeeds: but when he calls
   enemies possessors, he means that there would be such a calamity, that
   the Jews would for a long time, even for their life, be banished from
   their country, and would lose their possessions. They thought that the
   land was so given to them, that it could never be taken from them: and
   doubtless the Lord would have never expelled them, had they not defiled
   it with their pollutions; but as they had polluted it by their sins,
   they deserved to be banished from it. So the Prophet shews that their
   confidence was absurd, in thinking that they would be the perpetual
   inheritors of that land: "Succeed you, "he says, "shall others, who
   shall possess it as it were by an hereditary right." We now perceive
   the Prophet's meaning.

   He afterwards mentions the reason why God had resolved to deal so
   severely with them, For they are, he says, from the least to the
   greatest given up to avarice [224] He means that no equity prevailed
   among the people; for under one kind of sin he includes all frauds and
   plunders, and every kind of injustice. He then says, that every one was
   addicted to his own gain, so that they practiced mutual wrongs without
   any regard to what was right and just.

   He then enlarges on the subject and says, that all, from the prophet to
   the priest, acted deceitfully There is here also a part mentioned for
   the whole. But Jeremiah in various ways sets forth the wrongs by which
   men harassed one another. Nor does he exclude violence when he speaks
   of fraud; but it is the same as though he said, that they, being
   forgetful of what was right, practiced fraud of every kind. It was,
   indeed, a dreadful thing, that there remained no rectitude or justice
   in the prophets and the priests, who ought to have carried light for
   others, and to have shewn to them the right way, as God had constituted
   them to be the leaders of the people. Since, then, even these acted
   deceitfully, there must have been among the common people the most
   disgraceful injustice. Hence the Prophet shews by these words, that God
   could not be charged with too much rigor, as though he treated the
   people cruelly; for there was such a mass of wickedness, that it could
   no longer be borne. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [224] It would be more suitable to render "for" because, as it is
   explanatory of lkn, "for this," or, for this reason, at the beginning
   of the verse. This illative, and others too, are often used
   anticipatively, -- For this reason, give will I Their wives to
   strangers, their fields to inheritors; Because from the least even to
   the greatest, Ever one covets gain; From the prophet even to the
   priest, Every one practices deception. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 8:11

   11. For they have healed the hurt of the daughter of my people
   slightly, saying, Peace, peace; when there is no peace.

   11. Et curarunt vulnus filiae populi mei super nihilo, dicendo, Pax,
   pax; et nulla pax.


   THE Prophet repeats what we have noticed in the sixth chapter: but it
   was necessary to reiterate often, to the deaf and the slothful, what
   had already been forgotten, or what had not touched their hearts. As
   these things have been already explained, I shall now only refer
   briefly to the main points.

   He no doubt condemns here the priests and the prophets. He spoke before
   generally of the whole people, "from the least," he said, "to the
   greatest." But as for the sake of amplifying, he had expressly
   mentioned the prophets and the priests as given to fraudulent dealings,
   he now in an especial manner condemns them, not only for grievously
   offending God, but also for deceiving others by their flatteries, as
   though they were allowed to sin with impunity. It is, indeed, an
   inexcusable crime in those, who ought to lead others, to be no less
   wicked than the common people; for they not only by their example, but
   also by their doctrine, corrupt the whole community, and thus they
   increase the evil twofold. It was therefore an intolerable impiety,
   when they were so presumptuous as to spread those falsehoods, by which
   they led the people to despise God and his law. Hence he says, that
   they healed the wound of the people, while God was yet shewing tokens
   of his wrath. And he speaks, as it has been said elsewhere, by way of
   concession, as though he had said, that they were very foolish
   physicians in applying plaisters to cover the wrath of God. [225]

   Behold, he says, they have healed the wound of my people, saying,
   Peace, peace By mentioning the word twice the Prophet shews more
   clearly how supine was their security; for they deceived the people not
   only once, but proceeded obstinately in the work of deceiving the
   wretched people by their false promises. He adds, When there was no
   peace This may be taken in two ways, -- that God by the event exposed
   their madness, -- or, that when there was no prosperity, they still
   fallaciously promised peace. As God elsewhere complains that the
   prophets flattered the people, so he does here: such sentences we have
   already often explained. He then adds --

   Jeremiah 8:12

   12. Were they ashamed when they had committed abomination? nay, they
   were not at all ashamed, neither could they blush: therefore shall they
   fall among them that fall: in the time of their visitation they shall
   be cast down, saith the Lord.

   12. An pudor (est enim interrogative hoc legendum, sicuti capite sexto
   diximus, subaudienda igitur est particula, An; An ergo pudefacti sunt)
   quod abominationem patrarunt? etiam in pudore non pudifacti sunt, et
   erubescere non noverunt; propterea cadent inter cadentes; in tempore
   visitationis ipsorum impingent (vel, corruent,) dicit Jehova.


   The Prophet in these words shews still more clearly that they were
   wholly irreclaimable; for they had divested themselves of every shame.
   It is no doubt a proof of a wickedness past all remedy, when no shame
   remains. This verse has been also explained in the sixth chapter; it
   forms the fifteenth verse. But we must bear in mind the design of the
   Prophet. It is then briefly this, -- to shew that the wickedness of the
   people was unhealable, and for this reason, because they had an iron
   front.

   Hence he asks, Have they been ashamed, because they have committed
   abomination? as though he had said, "They have been proved guilty of
   wickedness, can they be made to feel any shame?" To this he answers,
   Even in their shame they are not ashamed The particle gm, gam, even, is
   emphatic, Then the meaning may be thus given, -- that when God brought
   against them their shameful conduct, and proved them guilty, so that
   they could not escape by any evasion -- that when they were thus
   convicted, they yet had no feeling of shame. At the same time, this
   passage may be explained as referring to what is commonly called actual
   conviction; for they were well -- nigh consumed with miseries, through
   their untamable perverseness, while contending with God's judgment.
   Even then in shame itself they had no feeling of shame

   Added is the reason, They know not how to blush By this want of shame,
   then, Jeremiah proves that they were men past remedy. And on this
   account he adds, Fall therefore shall they among those who fall, and in
   the time of their visitation they shall perish, or stumble. By these
   words he intimates that they were no longer to be reasoned with, and
   that God's vengeance would be just in wholly destroying them, for he
   had in vain spoken to them, he had in vain contended with them, he had
   in vain tried to bring them to the right way. The import of the whole
   then is, -- that the only thing that remained for them was destruction;
   for they had without shame rejected all instruction and every warning.

   And he says, among the fallen, because every one, as it is commonly the
   case, encouraged others in their contempt of God, and in their
   perverseness. When therefore they saw others to be like themselves,
   they entertained hope of impunity; and hence they were allured to sin
   by this deception. On this account the Prophet says, that ruin was nigh
   them all. They shall fall, he says, among the fallen, [226] and stumble
   in the time of their visitation. He shews that God had fixed a day in
   which they were to be destroyed. But if he deferred the time, there was
   no reason for them to think that it would be to their advantage; for
   they would by their obstinacy procure for themselves a heavier
   judgment. In short, though God might spare them for a time, yet the
   Prophet warns them, that this would avail them nothing, as God's time
   of visitation was fixed. Then follows a confirmation --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [226] This may be differently understood. There are here throughout the
   passage two parties spoken of, -- the people, and the priests together
   with the prophets. The "wise" men, in Jeremiah 8:9, made ashamed were
   the people deluded by the priests and prophets. Those who felt no
   shame, mentioned in this verse, though their words proved false, were
   the priests and prophets: and hence we see the import of this
   expression here, that they were appointed to fall with the fallen, that
   punishment would reach them as well as the people. This verse is
   somewhat different from the fifteenth of the sixth chapter, and may be
   thus rendered, -- 12. Have they been ashamed, Because they have done
   abomination? Even with shame they are not ashamed, And how to blush
   they know not: Therefore fall shall they with the fallen; At the time
   of their visitation They shall perish, saith Jehovah. The "abomination"
   was the perversion of the law so as to justify idolatry and all kinds
   of wickedness. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 8:13

   13. I will surely consume them, saith the Lord: there shall be no
   grapes on the vine, nor figs on the fig tree, and the leaf shall fade;
   and the things that I have given them shall pass away from them.

   13. Colligendo colligam (vel, perdendo perdam,) dicit Jehova: non uvae
   in vite (vel, botri,) et non ficus in ficulnea; et folium decidet, et
   dabo illis, transibunt (hoc est, quae dedere illis transibunt ab
   ipsis.)


   He confirms, as I have said, what he had declared in the last verse,
   tie had said, that there would be the ruin of the whole people: for the
   same purpose he now adds, Destroying I will destroy them The verb 'sph,
   asaph, properly means "to collect, "but metaphorically, "to destroy;"
   as we say in our language, Trousser; Je les trousserai tous ensemble.
   And hence it more fully appears, that the Prophet explains what he had
   said, that destruction was nigh them all, so that none would remain,
   that is, with regard to the people as a body, as a community; for God
   ever preserved a remnant. We have, indeed, said elsewhere, and we shall
   have to notice the same thing often again, that the prophets, regarding
   the people as a body, threatened them all with destruction; but when
   they addressed the elect, and the faithful, they added a modification:
   Destroying I will then destroy them

   He afterwards shews the manner: No grapes shall be on the vines, and no
   figs on the fig -- trees The word for "fig" means the fruit as well as
   the tree, as it is well known. And that he might more fully set forth
   God's vengeance, he says, that the very leaves would wither. The
   meaning is, that God would soon come as an avenger, however securely
   the Jews might be resting in their sins: and he shews the kind of
   vengeance that awaited them, -- that God would deprive them of all
   sustenance and support; by mentioning a part for the whole, he includes
   everything necessary for life. He speaks not of wine, and of corn, and
   of oil; but by figs and grapes, as I have said, he comprehends every
   kind of sustenance; and even the leaves would wither and fall.

   In the second place, he adds, Even, what I shall give them shall pass
   away from them Some apply this to the fruit in the granaries and
   cellars, as though he had said, "Even if they should have provisions in
   their storehouses and cellars, and be furnished with plenty, all this
   shall yet avail them nothing, for it shall be all taken away; for to
   pass away has often this meaning; and the m, mem, affixed, is the same
   as though it was mhm, meem, from them. Others render the words, "they
   shall pass over them;" but this is too strained. They refer to the
   precepts granted to the Jews, which they had rendered void or
   neglected: but this cannot suit the passage. And as to the first
   explanation, it seems to me too limited. I therefore take this to be
   the meaning, -- "Even if the grapes and figs come to maturity, yet what
   they shall consider as already prepared shall be taken away." The
   Prophet then means, that there would be various ways by which the Jews
   would be reduced to penury and want; for either the enemies would rob
   them of their grapes and figs, or he himself would send sterility; or,
   when they thought their provisions secured to them, they would not yet
   be allowed to enjoy them. This is the import of the whole. [227] It
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [227] The verse may be thus rendered, -- 13. I will gather their
   ingathering, saith Jehovah: No grapes shall be on the vine, And no figs
   on the fig-tree, Even the leaf shalt fade away; For I will give these
   to those who shall pass through them. God threatens the Jews with the
   deprivation of the fruits of the earth. He would gather their fruits by
   means of their enemies, such as would pass through them; and there
   would be no limits for them. As to the last line, it is a common thing
   in Hebrew to leave out the relative "who" before a verb in the future
   tense. So it is in Welsh -- Canys rhoddav y rhain iddynt hwy a
   dramwyant trwyddynt. The most literal and the most suitable to the
   context is this rendering. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 8:14

   14. Why do we sit still? assemble yourselves, and let us enter into the
   defenced cities, and let us be silent there: for the Lord our God hath
   put us to silence, and given us water of gall to drink, because we have
   sinned against the Lord.

   14. Ut quid nos sedemus? congregate vos, et ingrediamur urbes munitas
   (urbes munitionis, ad verbum,) et quiescamus illic: certe Jehova Deus
   noster silere nos (vel, quiescere nos) fecit, et potavit nos a quis
   venenatis (vel, aquis fellis; nam r's, significat fel et venenum;) quia
   impie egimus contra Jehovam.


   This verse, and those which follow, are explained in different ways;
   but I will briefly shew the meaning of the Prophet. I have no doubt but
   that he speaks here in the name of the whole people. The Prophet, then,
   in these words, represents what occupied their minds, and the counsels
   which the Jews adopted: and further, there is no doubt but that he
   shews in these words that they, as hypocrites are wont to do, had
   recourse to expedients, by which they thought they could protect
   themselves from God's wrath. For they who think that the Prophet spoke
   his own sentiments are greatly mistaken: on the contrary, he relates
   here the purposes which the Jews formed; and at the same time he
   reproves their hardness in turning here and there, and in thinking that
   they could turn aside the judgment of God; for hypocrites, unless
   constrained, never ascend to the first cause; that is, they never
   acknowledge nor regard the hand of him who strikes them, as it is said
   in another place. (Isaiah 9:13.) They indeed feel their evils, and seek
   to apply remedies; but they stop at the nearest reliefs, without
   seeking to pacify God and to return into favor with him; and when the
   smallest hope is given them, they think themselves to be safe, if they
   betake themselves to this or that hiding-place.

   This feeling is what the Prophet describes: Why do we sit? or, "Why do
   we rest?" But the word here means to sit still: Why do we then sit
   still? as though they had accused themselves of sloth or idleness:
   "What means this our slothfulness? we sit still in the villages, which
   are exposed to the violence of enemies: gather then yourselves, and let
   us enter into fortified cities; we shall rest there." They thought that
   they should be safe, if they entered into fortified cities. Then, on
   the other hand, Jeremiah shews how foolishly they trusted to such
   refuges. Surely, he says, our God hath made us silent He had said
   before vndmh-sm, vanudame-shem, "and we shall there rest." The verb,
   means to rest, and to be silent. He repeats the same word, "Surely, our
   God hath made us to be silent;" but in a different sense. There is then
   a striking allusion in the verb dmh, dame, or the sameness of sound.
   "Jehovah hath made us to be silent, "or to rest; or, he hath cut us
   off, for in Hiphil, it has this meaning. [228]

   We hence see, that on the one hand is declared what might have given
   some comfort to the Jews, for there were fortified cities which might
   have protected them from the assaults of enemies; but, on the other
   hand, the Prophet shews that they were greatly mistaken, for God would
   make them to rest in a different manner, as he would reduce them to
   nothing; for the dead are said to rest, or to be silent. In short, he
   means a quiet state when speaking in the name of the people; but he
   refers to destruction when speaking by God's command.

   He afterwards confirms the same thing in a metaphorical language, God
   will give them the waters of gall, or, poisoned waters: and he adds,
   Because they have acted impiously against Jehovah We may learn from
   this last part, that the Prophet is now performing the duty of his
   office. The people indeed never willingly allowed that they were
   suffering punishment justly due to their sins; but the Prophet here
   reproves them for hoping to be safe by fleeing to fortified cities, as
   though God could not follow them there. He then says that God's
   vengeance would closely pursue them, and that wherever they fled, they
   would still be exposed to evils, for they carried with them their
   impieties, which would draw upon them the wrath of God. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [228] The verb dmhmeans, to be silent, to be reduced to silence; and
   the silence is that of inactivity, or of weakness, or of death. The
   silence of inactivity seems to be the meaning in the first instance,
   and the silence of weakness in the second: "Let us be silent," or, let
   us rest; "God hath made us silent," or, made us feeble, or, reduced to
   nothing our strength: -- 14. Why do we sit still? be ye assembled, And
   let us go into fortified cities, And let us be silent there; For
   Jehovah our God has reduced us to silence; And he has given us to drink
   the water of hemlock, Because we have sinned against Jehovah. That
   r'sis "hemlock," or some poisonous herb, is evident from Hosea 10:4.
   "The water" seems to be the juice in this instance -- "the juice of
   hemlock." It is rendered "the water of gall, hudor cholos," by the
   Septuagint, and the same by the Vulgate; "bitter waters," by the
   Syriac; "water of bitterness," by the Arabic; "the cup of malediction,"
   by the Targum. "Water of hemlock" is the rendering of Blayney. Horsley
   renders the third and the fourth line as follows: -- And let us there
   sit in despair, Since the Lord our God hath brought us to despair. --
   Ed.

   Jeremiah 8:15

   15. We looked for peace, but no good came; and for a time of health,
   and behold trouble!

   15. Expectando [229] pacem (vel, ad pacem) et non bonum; ad tempus
   sanationis, et ecce terror (aut, turbatio.)


   He explains his meaning more clearly in this verse, -- that the Jews in
   vain flattered themselves, while they entertained vain hopes. He then
   says that there was no reason for them to deceive themselves; for were
   they to promise themselves peace a hundred times, ruin would still be
   nigh them, and that though they hoped for a time of healing, terror
   would assail them. We hence see that in the last verse his purpose was
   to shew how foolish the people were, who thought that they would be
   safe by means of the remedies which seemed to be at hand, though they
   despised God's judgment. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [229] The word is qvh, hoping, or longing, rendered by all the ancient
   versions, as though it were in the first person plural. It may be taken
   as a noun, -- The hope was for peace, but there was no good! For a time
   of healing, but behold terror! -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 8:16

   16. The snorting of his horses was heard from Dan: the whole land
   trembled at the sound of the neighing of his strong ones; for they are
   come, and have devoured the land, and all that is in it; the city, and
   those that dwell therein.

   16. A Dan auditus est fremitus equorum ejus, a voce hinnituum
   robustorum ejus tremefacta est (vel, contremuit) tota terra; quia
   venient (nam copula hic resolvi debet in causalem particulam) et
   comedent terram et plenitudinem (vel, copiam) ejus, urbem et
   habitatores ejus.


   He says, Heard has been the snorting of horses from Daniel Dan was on
   the extremities, as it is well known, of the land of Canaan. Some think
   that the loudness of the noise is intended, as it was heard from such a
   distance in the holy city itself; but I know not whether this can be
   gathered from the words of the Prophet. The simpler and the correcter
   meaning then is, that though Jerusalem rested securely, they were not
   yet in a quiet state on the borders of the land, for they were
   disturbed by the snorting of the enemies' horses. From Dan then has
   been heard a snorting When the inhabitants of a city indulge in
   pleasures, while the borders of the land are assailed by enemies, it
   might be pertinently said to them, "Why do ye here live at your ease?
   your neighbors and your brethren are exposed to the assaults of
   enemies: war therefore ought to be waged in your land, though it has
   not yet reached your gates and your walls." So the Prophet speaks here:
   "From Dan has been heard the snorting of his horses." The relative
   "his" may be applied to the Assyrians; for the Hebrews often use
   relatives without antecedents. But it is more probable that Jeremiah
   refers to the first mover of the war, even God; as though he had said,
   -- "God will send forth hostile armies, which will disturb the borders
   of your land." He then calls them the horses of God; for the Chaldeans
   did not wage that war, but under the authority of God, as we have often
   seen, and shall have to notice often again.

   Then he says, At the noise of the neighings of his strong ones, etc. He
   calls the horses "strong," 'vyrym, abirim; and as he had not described
   them, he now does so. Trembled, he says, has the land at the noise of
   the neighings of his strong ones As he mentions the neighings of
   horses, we must understand "strong" as referring to the horses
   themselves. Come, he says, shall they, and shall devour the land and
   its fullness, the city and its inhabitants Here is an irregularity as
   to the number; for he puts city for cities, as he threatens not only
   Jerusalem, but also the neighboring cities. Whatever then might be the
   abundance in the land, the enemies would devour it; and he says also,
   that they would devour the cities and their inhabitants. It follows --

   Jeremiah 8:17

   17. For, behold, I will send serpents, cockatrices, among you, which
   will not be charmed, and they shall bite you, saith the Lord

   17. Quia ecce ego mitto in vos serpentes, regulos (quidam tamen
   subaudiunt copulam, serpentes et regulos) quibus nulla erit incantatio,
   et mordebunt vos, dicit Jehova.


   He increases their terror by another comparison, -- that not only
   enemies would violently attack them, but that their bitings would be
   venomous. He had spoken of horses, and mentioned their violent onsets;
   but he now expresses another thing, -- that the Jews would have to
   carry on war with vipers and basilisks The Prophet no doubt only meant
   to shew that they could not possibly escape; for as from serpents men
   can hardly escape, especially when they are numerous, and assail them
   on every side, so he intimates, that the war would be fatal to the
   Jews, when attacked by serpents and vipers.

   They shall bite you, he says, and for them there will be no
   incantation; that is, by no means can they be driven away from you. If
   one asks, Can serpents be driven away by incantations? the answer is,
   -- that the Prophet here does not refer to what is true, but speaks
   according to the common opinions of men. It has been thought in all
   ages, that serpents can be driven away by incantations, or be killed,
   or be deprived of the power of hurting. "The deadly snake, "says
   Virgil, in Eclo. viii., "is dissolved in the meadows by singing." What
   that heathen poet has said has been believed also by other nations; and
   as I have already said, it has been a commonly received opinion that
   serpents may be charmed. As then it was a common belief, the Prophet
   says, "If ye think that these serpents can be turned away, and the hurt
   that proceeds from them, ye are greatly deceived; for there will be for
   them no incantation." There is also a mention made of incantation in
   Psalm 58:6: but as I have already said, the prophets accommodate their
   words to the comprehension of men. The Prophet does here also
   indirectly reprove the Jews, by comparing their false resources to
   incantations, as though he had said, -- "Ye think that ye can soothe
   your enemies by flatteries and bribery, so that they may not hurt you;
   and ye also think that ye have ready at hand various means by which you
   may avert the evils which impend over you: in vain, he says, ye deceive
   yourselves with such hopes; for all your incantations as to these
   serpents shall be to no purpose, and wholly useless."

   We now then perceive the Prophet's intention, and see that by this
   figure he ironically derides the crafty measures of the people, and all
   the remedies which they thought they had in readiness when assailed by
   their enemies. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 8:18

   18 When I would comfort myself against sorrow, my heart is faint in me.

   18. Roborate meum (vel, quum vellem roborare me) super dolorem, super
   me cor meum infirmum est.


   Interpreters explain differently the word mvlgyty, mebelgiti. Some take
   m, mem, in the sense of v, beth; but others, with whom I agree, regard
   it as a servile, deriving the word from vlg, belag; and this letter is
   prefixed to it to shew that it is a noun. The t, tau, also at the end,
   is a servile. [230]

   The Prophet then means, that he sought strength in his sorrow, but that
   his heart was weak He no doubt, I think, sets forth in this verse the
   perverse character of the people, -- that they sought through their
   obstinacy to drive away every punishment. This could not indeed be
   referred to himself, or to those who were like him, as we know how
   fearful are God's servants with regard to his wrath; for as the fear of
   God prevails in their hearts, so they are easily terrified by his
   judgment; but hypocrites and wicked men ever harden themselves as far
   as they can. They then strengthened themselves against God, and thought
   in this way to be conquerors. Since they thus perversely contended with
   God, the Prophet sets forth here the great hardness of the people: I
   would, he says, strengthen myself in my sorrow; but my heart is within
   me weak; that is, "In vain are these remedies tried; in vain have ye
   hitherto endeavored to strengthen yourselves, and have sought
   fortresses and strongholds against God; for sorrow will at length
   prevail, as the Lord will add troubles to troubles, so that ye must at
   length succumb under them."

   He means the same when he says, his heart was within him weak: "I have,
   "he says, "been oppressed with sorrow, when I thought I had strength
   enough to resist." For thus the ungodly think manfully to act, when
   they madly resist God; but at length they find by the event that they
   in vain seek thus to strengthen themselves; for our heart, he says,
   will become within us weak, and debility itself will at last oppress
   and overwhelm us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [230] The ancient versions and the Targum all differ as to the meaning
   of this word; and it is difficult to make the original to agree with
   any of them. The word, as in the received text, is a verbal noun from
   Hiphil, with a iod affixed to it, and is either a personal noun in the
   feminine gender, "my consoler," or "strengthener," meaning his own
   soul,-or a common noun, "my consolation," or "strength," meaning God.
   But Schultens, regarding the verb as signifying to smile or to laugh,
   and thinking that it means here the laugh of misery or of contempt,
   renders it "O thou (i.e., the daughter of Sion) that grinnest at me for
   pain," and sayest, "within me the heart is sick." The Targum seems to
   favor this view, as it mentions the division of the people. Blayney,
   according to several copies, divides the word thus, mvly gyty, and
   considers the one as a negative, and the other a verbal noun from ghh,
   to heal, and renders the verse thus: -- Sorrow is upon me past my
   remedying,
   My heart within me is faint. Still the simplest way, and the most
   suitable to the passage, is to take the word as a common noun,
   signifying consolation, comfort or strength, and to consider the words
   as addressed to God, -- My strength! within me is sorrow, Within me is
   my heart faint. "Faint," that is, through grief. It is rendered
   "grieve," or "is sorrowful," by all the ancient versions and the
   Targum. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since we have been abundantly taught by
   ancient examples how insane they are who bend not under thy
   threatenings, and repent not in due time while thou invitest them to
   repentance, -- O grant, that we may wholly give up ourselves to be
   disciplined by thee, and that we may not only bear with submissive
   minds to be chastised, but also learn by thy warnings to return without
   delay to thee, and that we may so remain in obedience to thee, that
   with unceasing perseverance we may fight under thy banner, until having
   at length finished our warfare, we shall enjoy that blessed rest which
   has been prepared for us by Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 8:19

   19. Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people because of
   them that dwell in a far country: Is not the LORD in Zion? is not her
   king in her? Why have they provoked me to anger with their graven
   images, and with strange vanities?

   19. Ecce vox clamoris filiae populi mei a terra longinqua, An Jehova
   non est in Sion? an rex ejus non est in ea? Quare provocarunt me ad
   iram in suis sculptilibus? in vanitati-bus aiieni?


   The Prophet in this verse assumes different characters: he first
   denounces ruin, which, though near, was not yet dreaded by the people;
   he then represents the people, and relates what they would say; in the
   third place, he adds an answer in God's name to check the clamors of
   the people.

   When he says that the daughter of his people uttered a cry, he is to be
   understood as referring to a future time; for the Jews as yet continued
   perversely in their sins, and ridiculed all threatenings, and regarded
   as nothing what was said by the prophets. Jeremiah then does not mean
   that his own nation cried, as though they dreaded future calamities,
   (for they were heedlessly secure;) but he condemns their indifference,
   as though he had said, "Ye indeed do now indulge your own delusions,
   and think that your felicity is to be perpetual; but in a short time
   your cry will be heard." The words, From a distant land, interpreters
   apply to the Chaldeans and Assyrians, as though the Prophet had said,
   "Ye hope for a perpetual rest, because your enemies are far from you;
   hence distance and delay in marching produce this security in you; for
   it seems not to you credible that your enemies shall make such a
   journey, except with much expense and much trouble; but in this opinion
   you are deceived; for though the Chaldeans and the Assyrians are far
   distant from you, yet they shall soon come and constrain you to utter a
   cry: ye cannot now bear the warnings of the prophets, my voice ye
   cannot endure; but God will constrain you to utter a different voice,
   for ye shall cry, but without any avail."

   This meaning is not without reason on its side: if then the Prophet's
   words be thus taken, I offer no objection; for hypocrites derive
   confidence from the present appearance of things; when they see that
   there is quietness on every side, they fear no danger; when God
   threatens them, and shews not immediately his rods, they ridicule or
   despise them.: thus have we seen in other places.

   But another meaning is not unsuitable, -- that Jeremiah describes the
   lamentations of the people in exile, after having been driven into
   Chaldea and Assyria: The voice, then, of the daughter of my people from
   a distant land; [231] that is, after having been deprived of their
   country, they will then begin to cry, and for this reason, because they
   wished the prophets to give them rest, and refused to bear any
   reproofs. Appropriate also is this view; but I prefer the former, --
   that the people would shortly find out how foolishly they deluded
   themselves, when God by his servants threatened them with ruin and
   destruction: and hence he uses the demonstrative particle, "Behold:"
   Behold, he says, the voice of crying; and yet great was the silence
   then at Jerusalem: for though in their pleasure they uttered some
   voices, yet as to weepings and lamentations the whole city was silent.
   The Prophet then refers to what was hidden. But God usually acts in
   this way, as he afterwards executes suddenly his judgment; for when the
   wicked say, Peace, peace, destruction comes and suddenly overwhelms
   them. (1 Thessalonians 5:8.)

   He adds in the second place, Is not Jehovah in Sion? Is not her king in
   her? The Prophet no doubt expresses here the complaints of the people
   on finding themselves overwhelmed with so many and so great evils,
   without receiving any aid from heaven. For hypocrites ever expostulate
   with God; and as they consider that they are unjustly chastised, they
   reject every instruction, and avoid it as much as they can; in short,
   they seek stupidity, that they may deceive themselves with vain
   delusions. As then it is usual with hypocrites to reject every
   apprehension of God's wrath, Jeremiah strikingly describes their
   contumacy, "Is not Jehovah in Sion? Is not her king in her?" For they
   accused God of falsehood, as though he had deceived them, since he had
   promised to be the defender of the city, and of the whole land. As then
   they thought that God was bound to them by this promise, they daringly
   raged against him, "What means this? for God has chosen this place,
   where Abraham's race might worship him; it has been as it were his
   earthly kingdom: but now what can this mean, that enemies are coming
   here? Can God ever permit them to do so? This is not possible, except
   God himself be overcome."

   We hence see the import of the Prophet's words; for he here imitates
   the perverse language of the people, and recites the words which he
   knew most of them used. We have before found him addressing them,

   "Trust not in words of falsehood, saying, The temple of Jehovah, the
   temple of Jehovah, the temple of Jehovah,"
   (Jeremiah 7:4;)

   for they were wont perversely to allege against God, the temple, and to
   regard it as a shield to ward off every evil. In the same way the
   Prophet says now, "Is not God in Sion?" and then, "Is not her king in
   her?" The Jews were not only persuaded that God would be propitious to
   them, but they doubted not of their own safety, while they could turn
   their eyes to their king. They therefore uttered these words, as though
   they were beyond the chance of danger: for we know what God had
   declared respecting the kingdom, that it would continue for ever: So
   long as the sun and moon shall be in heaven, shall remain the seat of
   David, and his posterity flourish. (Psalm 89:36, 37.) Hence they
   connected the king with God; as though they had said, "Here is God
   worshipped, and his power dwells in the temple; the king also, whom he
   has set over us, is a sure pledge of his favor; and the perpetuity of
   his kingdom has been promised to us: it then follows, that either God
   is untrue, and that we have been deceived with vain promises, or that
   our enemies will come in vain; for when they shall make every effort,
   God, who is the guardian of our safety, will easily drive them away."

   At the first view this seems to be an evidence of faith, as the people
   seemed persuaded that they should be safe and secure under the
   protection of God, and as they turned their eyes to that kingdom, which
   was a remarkable exhibition of God's presence: for as David was a type
   of Christ, and also his posterity, no other refuge could have been
   sought by the faithful than that which is here described. But we know
   how hypocrites swell with vain confidence, while yet they are wholly
   destitute of faith, and how they become wantonly insolent whenever God
   threatens them, as though they held him bound at their will. As then
   the ungodly are wont thus to abuse the name of God, it is no wonder
   that they imitate the language of his true servants: but yet they are
   wholly different. How so? They lay hold on the promises, but they have
   no faith nor repentance. "This is my rest for ever: it then follows
   that we shall be ever safe, for God cannot be overcome by any force of
   arms, by any onset of enemies; since he has taken us under his
   protection, what have we to fear?" But, at the same time, they despised
   God and all his teaching.

   We hence see how foolish was the boasting of that people, since they
   wholly despised the holy name of God, and did swell only with wind,
   inasmuch as they were altogether destitute of faith and piety. We must
   also ever keep in mind what I have already said, -- that the Jews not
   only entertained this vain confidence, but also presumptuously rose up
   against God, as though he had deceived them, having promised that Sion
   would be his perpetual rest: they now ask him, why he did not defend
   the city, as he dwelt in Sion? and why was not the king their
   protection, since it had been said, "So long as the sun and moon shall
   be in heaven, shall remain the throne of David?" Now follows God's
   answer.

   Why then have they provoked me with their carvings, and the vanities of
   the foreigner? Here God retorts their false complaints. We hence learn,
   that in the last clause the contumacy of the people is what is set
   forth by Jeremiah: they raged against God, because he did not aid them
   in time. God shews how absurdly they complained against him, and
   accused him: Why, he says, have they provoked me? "They say now that
   they are forsaken, because there is no faithfulness in me: I have not
   betrayed them, nor forsaken them, but they have forsaken me " We now
   perceive the meaning of the Prophet. We observe, indeed, that the
   passage is abrupt, for the Prophet assumes different characters; but as
   to what is meant there is nothing doubtful.

   God says, that he was provoked with carvings: it hence follows, that
   the temple was polluted. God had indeed promised to dwell in the
   temple, but on a certain condition, provided he was faithfully, and in
   a legitimate manner, worshipped there; but the people with their
   pollutions had defiled the temple. God then shews that there was a just
   cause why he had departed, according to what is set forth more fully in
   the tenth chapter of Ezekiel: God shews to his servant in that vision
   that he had left the temple, and for this reason, -- because his
   holiness could not be blended with ungodly and filthy profanations. He
   first mentions carvings generally, and then he adds, the vanities of
   the foreigner: and here he amplifies the sin of the people, because
   they borrowed here and there from foreigners such superstitions as were
   unknown to their fathers, as though they wished to banish God from the
   temple, and from the whole land. [232] It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [231] Literally it is, "The voice of the shout of the daughter of my
   people," four words in succession, and three in regimine by
   juxtaposition. The Welsh is exactly the same, "Llev gwaedd merch vy
   mhobl" -- Voice shout daughter my people. -- Ed.

   [232] The meaning of this verse is viewed by some differently. Their
   exile is considered as referred to at the beginning of the verse, "from
   a distant land," -- or literally, "from the land of the remote ones."
   All the versions render the preposition "from," and not "because of,"
   as in our version. The Prophet contemplates them as in banishment, and
   relates what they would say, and what answer God had for them: and they
   seem to have been thus contemplated to the end of the chapter, -- 19.
   Behold the voice of the cry of the daughter of my people From the land
   of the remote ones, -- "Was not Jehovah in Sion? Was not her king
   within her?" "Why! they provoked me with their carved images, With the
   vanities of the foreigner." Then follows the continuation of the cry in
   exile, -- 20. "Passed has the harvest, Ended has the summer, And we
   have not been saved!" The "King," in verse 19, is "Jehovah" in the
   former line. "The vanities of the foreigner" were idols: they were
   vanities, because they could do nothing, neither good nor evil. What
   made them gods were the imaginations of the infatuated and
   superstitious. The gods of many now are nothing better. Every notion of
   God is false but what is consistent with his word. The Socinian god is
   not the true God; it is the fiction of a perverted mind. Nor is the god
   of the thorough Papists anything better, nor the god of the Pharisee.
   -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 8:20

   20. The harvest is past, the summer is ended, and we are not saved.

   20. Transiit messis, finita est aestas, et nos non sumus servati.


   The Prophet shews now in the name of the people what was the hindrance.
   At the time Jeremiah spoke, the Jews confidently boasted that God was
   their defender; and they did not think that the Chaldeans were
   preparing for an expedition. But as they were inflated with false
   confidence, the Prophet here recites what they would presently say,
   Passed has the harvest, ended has the summer, and we have not been
   saved; that is, "We thought that the associates, with whom we have made
   alliances, would at length come to our aid; and we have in this respect
   been deceived." In saying, that the harvest had passed, some think that
   they expected help from the Egyptians after they had gathered their
   corn into barns; for there is then more leisure, and then also there
   are provisions for the army. But the Prophet seems to include the whole
   time suitable for carrying on war; as though he had said, "What will
   become of us at last? for if the Egyptians intended to bring help, they
   would have done so at the suitable time of the year; but passed has the
   harvest, and the summer has ended: will they come now, when the
   severity of winter constrains them to keep at home?."

   It is the same as though they had said, "There is no hope of aid either
   from the Egyptians or from other confederates, for the seasonable time
   is gone by." There was nothing less credible to the Jews at that time;
   for as it; has elsewhere appeared, they doubted not but that the
   Egyptians would bring them aid, and supply them with help instead of
   God: but the Prophet intimates, that whatever the Egyptians might have
   promised would be in vain, and wholly useless, that the people would at
   length find out by experience that their promises were mere trumperies,
   yea, impostures and deceits. In short, he describes in the name of the
   people (that what he said might be more emphatical) what they would
   soon find out, though they would not believe it at that time. It
   follows --

   Jeremiah 8:21

   21. For the hurt of the daughter of my people am I hurt; I am black;
   astonishment hath taken hold on me.

   21. Super contritione filiae populi mei contritus sum, obtenebratus
   sum, stupor (nam smm est stupere et attonitum esse; stupor ergo)
   apprehendit me.


   As the hardness of the people was so great, that the threatenings we
   have observed did not touch them, the Prophet now ascribes to himself
   what he had before attributed to them. We then see how the Prophet
   varies his mode of speaking; but it was necessary, for he was at a loss
   to find a way to address them sufficiently strong to penetrate into
   their stony and even iron hearts. We need not wonder, then, that there
   are so many figurative terms used by the Prophet; for it was needful to
   set before them God's judgment in various ways, that the people might
   be awakened out of their torpid state.

   He then says, that he was bruised for the bruising of his people. He
   was no doubt ridiculed by most of them: "Oh! thou grievest for thine
   own evils; it is well and prosperous with us: who has asked thee for
   this pity? Think not, then, that thou canst gain any favor with us, for
   we are contented with our lot. Weep rather for thine own calamities, if
   thou hast any at home; but suffer us at the same time to enjoy our
   pleasures, since God is propitious and indulgent to us." Thus then was
   the Prophet derided; but yet he warns the obstinate people, that they
   might be less excusable: he says, that he was rendered black; for
   sorrow brings blackness with it, and makes dark the face of man: it is
   a metaphorical expression. He says at last, that he was astonished
   [233] The astonishment with which he was seized he no doubt sets down
   as being the opposite of the people's torpor and insensibility, for
   they had no fear for themselves. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [233] To keep throughout the metaphorical character of this verse, it
   ought to be rendered thus, -- For the bruising of the daughter of my
   people I was bruised, I became black;
   Desolation possessed me. But taking the words as applied to the mind,
   divested of metaphor, we must render them thus, -- For the sorrow of
   the daughter of my people I sorrowed, I mourned;
   Astonishment possessed me. And this "astonishment" he explains in the
   next verse: there were means of restoration, and yet the people were
   not restored; at this he was astonished. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 8:22

   22 Is there no balm in Gilead? is there no physician there? why then is
   not the health of the daughter of my people recovered?

   22. An resina (aut, balsamus) non est in Gilead? an medicus non illic
   est? nam cur non ascendit sanitas filiae populi mei?


   The Prophet intimates in these words that the slaughter of the people
   would be so fatal that they would in vain seek remedies; as though he
   had said, that the disease would be incurable, and altogether deadly.
   The people, no doubt, ever devised for themselves many kinds of aids,
   according to what is commonly done; for ungodly men, when any danger
   appears, look around them on all sides; and when they think that they
   can be protected by any kind of assistance, or by any of the means they
   contrive, they rest secure and free from every trouble. Hence the
   Prophet, that he might dispel such vain confidences, says that there
   would be no rosin to heal their diseases. The rosin is a liquid which
   flows, not from every tree, but from the pine, and trees of that kind.

   We may conclude from this passage, as well as from other passages, that
   the best and the most valuable rosin was found in that part of Judea,
   called Gilead. Indeed the whole of Judea produced rosin; but as it was
   more abundant in Gilead, and as that rosin was more odoriferous and
   more powerful, he expressly mentions that place. The word tsry tsari,
   means also balsam: and as to this let each follow his own opinion, for
   the Jews themselves do not altogether agree. They who render it
   "treacle" wholly depart from the meaning, and offer what is absurd; for
   we know that treacle is made up of several ingredients: now rosin is
   not any sort of gum, but a thick liquid, as I have said, which belongs
   to trees; and from it comes rosin, and mastic, and other things; for
   the liquid becomes thick after it has flown from the trees.

   He says then, as one astonished, Is there not rosin in Gilead? Is there
   not a physician there? But the Prophet foretells here by the Spirit,
   that there would be such a destruction as could not by any means be
   avoided, that the disease would be incurable. For why, he says, does
   not health come to the daughter of my people? The reason is added,
   because healing could not be expected by the people; not that the Jews
   perceived this, for, on the contrary, they boasted, as I have said, of
   their perfect safety. But the Prophet here declares that a deadly
   disease was at hand, which would inevitably destroy the wicked [234]
   Afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [234] As the whole passage, from the 19th verse, is anticipative, and
   represents the ease of the Jews in captivity, this verse is to be
   viewed in the same light, and rendered in the past tense, -- 22. Was
   there not balm in Gilead? Was there not a healer there?
   Why then has not succeeded The recovery of the daughter of my people?
   Whether balm or rosin be meant, it makes no great difference; its
   healing virtues had become proverbial; and in this sense it is to be
   taken here. Kimchi held that it was balm or balsam, which Josephus
   reports was first brought to Judea by the Queen of Sheba. But the tree
   which produced tsry, was not an exotic, but indigenous in Judea, as it
   appears from Genesis 37:25, and 43:10; and it grew especially in
   Gilead, as it appears from this passage and from chap. 46:11 Bochart
   maintained that rosin is meant by the word, the gum drawn from the
   Terebinthus or the turpentine tree, which possesses strong healing
   virtues. It is rendered, "rhetine -- rosin," by the Septuagint, the
   Vulgate, and the Arabic; and "cera -- wax," by the Syriac. "Healer," or
   physician, is rendered "iatros -- healer," by the Septuagint, and
   "medicus," by the Vulgate, Syriac, and Arabic. It appears that Gilead
   was not only celebrated for its healing gum, but also for its medical
   men. The balm was the word of God, and the healer who applied it was
   the prophet or the teacher. Perhaps the most literal rendering of the
   first two lines is the following, and the most suitable to express
   astonishment, -- The balm, not in Gilead!:
   Verily, a healer, not there! -- Ed.

   CHAPTER 9
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 9:1

   1. Oh that my head were waters, and mine eyes a fountain of tears, that
   I might weep day and night for the slain of the daughter of my people!

   1. Quis ponet caput meum aquas, et oculum meum fontem lachrymarum? et
   deflebo die et nocte (hoc est, dies et noctes) interfectos filiae
   populi mei.


   He follows the same subject. During times of tranquillity, when nothing
   but joyful voices were heard among the Jews, he bewails, as one in the
   greatest grief, the miseries of the people; and being not satisfied
   with this, he says, Who will set, or make, my head waters, and my eye a
   fountain of tears? He intimates by these words, that the ruin would be
   so dreadful that it could not be bewailed by a moderate or usual
   lamentation, inasmuch as God's vengeance would exceed common bounds,
   and fill men with more dread than other calamities.

   The meaning is, that the destruction of the people would be so
   monstrous that it could not be sufficiently bewailed. It hence appears
   how hardened the Jews had become; for doubtless the Prophet had no
   delight in such comparisons, as though he wished rhetorically to
   embellish his discourse; but as he saw that their hearts were
   inflexible, and that a common way of speaking would be despised, or
   would have no weight and authority, he was constrained to use such
   similitudes. And at this day, there is no less insensibility in those
   who despise God; for however Prophets may thunder, while God spares and
   indulges them, they promise to themselves perpetual quietness. Hence it
   is, that they ridicule and insult both God and his servants, as though
   they were too harshly treated. As then, the same impiety prevails now
   in the world as formerly, we may hence learn what vehemence they ought
   to use whom God calls to the same office of teaching. Plain teaching,
   then, will ever be deemed frigid in the world, except it, be
   accompanied with sharp goads, such as we find employed here by the
   Prophet [235] He adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [235] This verse is connected by some with the last chapter: and it
   seems to belong to it. It forms in all the Hebrew MSS. the 23d verse of
   the preceding chapter. The phrase, my-ytn, "who will give," means a
   wish, "O that my head," etc., or "May my head," etc. The Septuagint,
   the Vulgate, the Arabic, and the Targum express it literally, "Who will
   give;" but the Syriac has, "O, I wish my head were turned into water."
   -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 9:2

   2. Oh that I had in the wilderness a lodging place of wayfaring men;
   that I might leave my people, and go from them! for they be all
   adulterers, an assembly of treacherous men.

   2. Quis statuet me in deserto, in diversorio (alii, tugurium, vertunt;
   sed nescio an reperiatur mlvn in hoc sensu) viatorum? et relinquam
   populum meum et discedam ab illis; quia omnes adulteri, conventus
   transgressorum (vel, perfidorum; nam vgdym sunt perfidi et apostatoe,
   ut alibi vidimus.)


   Here the Prophet entertains another wish: He had before wished that his
   head were waters, that he might shed tears, and he had wished his eyes
   to be the fountains of tears; but now, after having duly considered the
   wickedness of the people, he puts off every feeling of humanity, and as
   one incensed, he desires to move elsewhere, and wholly to leave the
   people; for their impiety had so prevailed that he could no longer live
   among them. It is indeed certain that the Prophet had no common grief,
   when he perceived that God's dreadful vengeance was not far distant: it
   is also certain that he was moved and constrained by their detestable
   conduct to desire to be removed elsewhere. But he speaks not only for
   his own sake; for he regards his own nation, and expresses his
   feelings, that he might more effectually touch their hearts. We must
   then understand, that so great was the sympathy of the Prophet, that he
   was not satisfied with shedding tears, but that he wished that his
   whole head would flow into fearn It appears, also, that he was so moved
   with idignation, that he wished wholly to leave his own people. But, as
   I have said, his object was to try whether he could restore them to the
   right way.

   He then shews, in this verse, that the Jews had become so detestable,
   that all the true servants of God wished to be removed far away from
   them: Who then will set me in the desert? He seeks not for himself
   another country; he desires not to dwell in a pleasant situation, or
   that some commodious asylum should be offered to him? but he desires to
   be placed in the desert, or in the lodging of travelers. He speaks not
   of those lodgings or inns, which were in villages and towns; but of a
   lodging in the desert; according to what is the case, when a long and
   tedious journey is made through forests, some sheds are formed, that
   when a traveler is over -- taken by the darkness of night, he might be
   protected by some covering, and not He down in the open air. It is of
   this kind of lodging that the Prophet speaks: then he no doubt means a
   shed; but as to the word, we may retain, as I have said, its proper
   meaning. What is meant is, that to dwell in the desert alllong wild
   beasts was better than to be among that abominable people. By
   expressing this wish he inflamed no doubt the fury of the whole people,
   or at least of most of them; but it was necessary thus forcibly to
   address them: as they submitted to no kind and wholesome warnings and
   counsels, they were to be forcibly stimulated and urged by such
   reproofs as these.

   I will leave my people This had an emphatic, bearing; for delightful to
   every one is his native soil, and it is also delightful to dwell among
   one's own people. As then the Prophet wished to be removed into the
   desert,, and to leave his own people, all his relatives and the nation
   from which he sprang, and to depart frora them, it follows that they
   nmst have come to extremities.

   And the reason is added, For all are adulterers I take the word mn'phym
   menaphim, adulterers, in a metaphorical sense, as meaning all those who
   had departed from God, and abandoned themselves to ungodly
   superstitions, or those who had become so vitiated and corrupt as to
   retain no integrity. He does not then call them adulterers, because
   they were given to whoredoms, but because they were immersed in all
   kinds of defilements. He afterwards calls them an assembly of
   apostates, or of perfidious men. The word tsr, otsar, means to
   prohibit, to restrain: hence the noun tsrt ostaret, means a summoned
   assembly, when, according to an oath or laws, men are forced to meet;
   and after the assembly is proclaimed, they dare not depart. Then the
   Prophet by this word points out the consent and union that existed
   among that people, as though he had said, that they no less clave to
   their sins, that if by a solemn rite or authority or ordinance they had
   been summoned together and were prohibited to depart. We hence see that
   he condemns the impious consent that was among the people, and also
   their pertinacity; for they could by no means be restored to a right
   mind. And for this reason he calls them also vgdym begadim,
   transgressors; for by this word the Hebrews mean, not every kind of
   sinners, but those who are wholly wicked: and hence the prophets, when,
   they speak of apostates and revolters, ever call them vgdym, begadim,
   as in this passage. [236] I shall not proceed farther.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [236] This verse may be rendered thus, -- O that I, had in the desert
   the lodging of travellers, Then I would go away from them; For all of
   them are adulterers, A company of hypocrites. He preferred living in
   the temporary sheds of travellers, erected in the desert, rather than
   to live among his own people. How intolerably wicked they must have
   been! A company, or an assembly, a multitude: the word need not be
   deemed as retaining its primary idea. The meaning is, that the whole
   community, the whole people, were hypocrites; they pretended to worship
   and serve God, and at the same time were idolaters and treacherous and
   immoral in their conduct. The word for "hypocrites" is derived from one
   that means a garment, a cloak, a covering; and the verb means to act
   under a cover, to act deceitfully, or falsely, or hypocritically, or
   perfidiously. It is rendered "deceivers" by the Septuagint,
   "prevaricators" by the Vulgate, "liars" by the Syriac, "falsifiers" by
   the Targum, and "perfidious dealers" by Blayney. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou hast been pleased that the
   prophetic writings should be preserved for our use, that they may
   continually excite us to repentance, and that since thou stiffest up
   daily those who urge us by their exhortations, and draw us, as it were
   by force, to repent, -- O grant, that there may not be in us such
   perverseness as we see existed in thine ancient people; but that we may
   render ourselves teachable, and be so moved by thy threatenings, as to
   anticipate thy judgment, lest we, mistaking thy forbearance, should at
   length be visited with that dread, described to us by thy servant
   Jeremiah, but that we may, on the contrary, find thee to the end to be
   not only a reconcilable but also a most merciful Father, until we shall
   at last enjoy a fuller knowledge of thy goodness in thy celestial
   kingdom, through Jesus Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   LECTURE THIRTy-FIFTH

   Jeremiah 9:3

   3. And they bend their tongues like their bow for lies; but they are
   not valiant for the truth upon the earth; for they proceed from evil to
   evil, and they know not me, saith the LORD.

   3. Et jaculati sunt lingua (quidam vertunt, Et jaculare fecerunt; alii,
   intenderunt linguas suas) arcum suum ad mendacia (alii vertunt, arcum
   mendacii; sed male;) et non ad veritatem roborati sunt (aut,
   invaluerunt) in terra; quia a malo ad malum egressi sunt, et me non
   cognoscunt, dicit Jehova.


   Jeremiah confirms what he had said of the near destruction of the
   people; for, as we have said, the Jews ridiculed threatenings while
   they thought themselves far from every danger. But the Prophet shews,
   from the nature of God himself, that they must necessarily perish in a
   short time; for since God is the judge of the world, and as they were
   continually advancing in impiety and wickedness, they could no longer
   be tolerated. This is the meaning.

   He first says, that they stretched their tongues as a bow for
   falsehoods The verb drk, darek, means to walk, and often occurs in this
   sense; but; it means also to stretch, to bend, and is frequently
   applied to bows. As it is here in Hiphil, some take it in a transitive
   sense. It ought in this case to have y, iod; but such defect is often
   found in other places. This sense is the most suitable; that is, that
   they shot with their tongues falsehood as with a bow. Others improperly
   construe sqr, shikor, in the genitive case, as though he had said, "the
   bow of falsehood, but this gives no meaning; and therefore "the bow of
   falsehood" cannot be admitted here. The sense is, that they shot
   falsehood with their tongue as with a bow, or that they made their
   tongue to go to falsehood, or that they stretched their tongue like a
   bow for falsehood. If the last rendering be approved, -- that they
   stretched their tongue, etc., then the Prophet compares their tongues
   to bows and falsehoods to arrows. As to the subject itself, there is no
   difference, whether we read that they shot lies with their tongues, or
   that they stretched their tongues for lies: for the Prophet simply
   means that their tongues, as he will hereafter tell us, were so pointed
   that they pierced one another with slanders and falsehoods, as though
   one stretched a bow and shot an arrow. He then intimates, that all
   their words were deadly, for they were intent on slanders and
   falsehoods, so that there was no intercourse without a mortal wound.

   He then adds, that they were not strong for the truth Some read, "They
   have been strong, but not for the truth;" others, "They have been
   strong as to the truth," or for the truth: but I think that the
   Prophet's meaning is different, -- that having checked the truth, they
   took more liberty for themselves, as though he had said that they
   triumphed when all faithfulness and rectitude were destroyed; for by
   the word, 'mvnh amune, the Prophet no doubt means that fidelity by
   which men ought to carry on their concerns one with another. Since,
   then, there was no uprightness among them, he says, that they marched
   forth as victorious when they trod under foot what was just and right.
   It is indeed a proof of extreme impiety, when men, trampling upon
   faithfulness and equity, allow themselves every kind of licentiousness.
   Some give this explanation, -- that they ruled, not through their
   faithfulness or virtues, for they had crept into and obtained honors by
   wicked and deceitful arts. And it. is indeed certain that the Prophet
   directs his discourse, not against the common people, but against the
   chief men, who had attained their power by frauds. But I am satisfied
   with the view that I have already given, -- that they had become strong
   because there was no truth, as when we say that the blind rule in
   darkness, when everything is in confusion. The meaning is, that they
   were not only given up to their sins, but that they also triumphed over
   fidelity and justice, by allowing themselves every liberty, as there
   was no one who dared to say a word to restrain them. He says, that they
   thus became strong through the whole land; for he sets forth here the
   deplorable state of the people in general; as though he had said,
   "There is no hope of deliverance left, for truth and faithfulness are
   everywhere oppressed." [237]

   An explanation follows, -- that they proceeded from evil to evil; that
   is, they obstinately went on in their evil doings; for to go forth
   means the same as to pass. They then passed from evil to evil; that is,
   when they had done one evil, no repentance entered their hearts, so as
   to turn back; but they continued their wickedness, and aceunrelated
   evils on evils. We now then understand what the Prophet means; for he
   sets forth their pertinacity in evil deeds, and at the same time shews
   that there was no evidence of amendment, for they passed from one bad
   deed to another like it.

   And me have they not known, saith Jehovah He shews here what is the
   source of all evils; they had cast aside every knowledge and every
   thought of God. We indeed know that when God is really known, his fear
   must necessarily influence our hearts; and the knowledge of God begets
   reverence and a regard for religion. It is indeed true, that God is
   somewhat known by even the ungodly and the wicked, and that they have
   some notions respecting him; but it is no more than an empty knowledge.
   When indeed we are fully persuaded that God is the judge of the world,
   and when we have also a knowledge of his goodness and paternal favor,
   we necessarily fear him and spontaneously and willingly worship and
   serve him. Ignorance of God, then, is a kind of madness which carries
   men headlong to every sort of impiety. On this account, God complains
   that he was not known by the people, for the fear of him was not in
   them. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [237] The ancient versions differ in rendering the first clauses of
   this verse: "They have bent their tongue like a bow; falsehood and not
   truth has prevailed over the land," Septuagint; -- "And they have
   stretched their tongue like a bow of falsehood, and not of truth; they
   have become strong in the land," Vulgate; -- "Their tongue as with
   their own bow have they shot; by falsity and perfidiousness they have
   become great in the land," Syriac; -- "Their tongues for falselhood
   have they bent, as a bow; and prevailed has perfidy over the land,"
   Arabic. Blayney makes a conjectural emendation, and Houbigant and
   Horsley make another; but neither is necessary. The literal version is
   as follows, -- And they bend their tongue, their lying bow; And not for
   truth are they strong in the land. "Their lying bow," or "their bow of
   falsehood;" it was a bow by which they shot lies; they employed their
   tongues for this purpose. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 9:4

   4. Take ye heed every one of his neighbour, and trust ye not in any
   brother: for every brother will utterly supplant, and every neighbour
   will walk with slanders.

   4. Et vir a socio suo cavete (hoc est, caveat; ad verbum, custodiat se;
   caveat igitur sibi quisque a socio,) et super omni fratre (ad verbum)
   ne confidatis (hoc est, nemo confidat proprio fratre;) quia omnis
   frater supplantando supplantat, et omnis socius fraudulenter incedit.


   In this verse the Prophet describes the extreme wickedness of the
   people. For though sometimes thefts, robberies, frauds, slaughters,
   perjuries, sorceries prevail, yet some regard for near relations
   remains; but it is monstrous when all relative affections are
   destroyed. As then, even in the most wicked, there remain some natural
   affections, called storgoe by philosophers, it follows, that men depart
   wholly from nature and become wild beasts, when these no longer exist.
   This is the import of what is here said.

   There is a similar passage in Micah 7:5, 6. The idea is there indeed
   more fully expanded; for the Prophet adds,

   "From her who sleeps in thy bosom guard the doors of thy mouth; for the
   son lies in wait for his father, and the daughter delivers up her
   mother to death; and the chief enemies of man are his own domestics."

   The prophets then mainly agree in shewing, that there was no humanity
   left among flmm; for the son, forgetful of his duty, rose up against
   his father, and every one was perfidious towards his own friend, and a
   brother spared not his own brother.

   Let a man then guard himself This is not an admonition, as though the
   Prophet exhorted men to be wary; but he only shews that there was no
   fidelity; for every one was perfidious and unfaithful towards his own
   friend, and even a brother acted unjustly towards his own brother. It
   hence follows, that the Jews are charged with being natural monsters;
   for they were deservedly objects of detestation, when they cast aside
   every care for their own blood, and as far as they could, destroyed
   everything like humanity. He says that brothers by supplanting
   supplanted, that is, craftily deceived and circumvented their own
   brothers. The verb qvokob, is to be taken mttaphorically; it is derived
   from the heel of the foot, and means to oppress the simple by secret
   arts. He says also, that all friends acted fraudulently. Of this kind
   of speaking we have spoken on Jeremiah 6:28; for we found there the
   same complaint; and the Prophet then said the Jews were like iron and
   brass, because they had hardened themselves so as to be capable of any
   cruelty. This sort of speaking often occurs, when the word rkyl, rekil,
   is connected with the verb hlk elak; and they who are the most learned
   in the language say, that this word is never found in Scripture but in
   connection with the verb to go or to walk. They hence conclude that
   some particular person is meant, that is, one who goes about veiled or
   deceitfully, and rambles and runs here and there, that he may find some
   opportunity of deceiving and cheating. It cannot be taken here for
   slandering, as we have also stated on chapter the sixth: it is too
   unmeaning. It is found indeed in this sense in Leviticus 19:16,

   "Go not about a slanderer among thy people;"

   where some render it a whisperer. But the Prophet no doubt condemns
   here the frauds and deceitful crafts, by which they deceived and
   cheated one another: for rkl, recal signifies a merchant; and as it is
   often the case that traders act cunningly and practice crafty
   artifices, the Hebrews call that man rkyl racal, fraudulent and
   wickedly crafty, whose object is to deceive and cheat. And we see that
   this is the meaning in this place, as it designates those who
   circumvented one another: for the Prophet says, that they were foolish
   who trusted in brothers or friends; and he gives the reason, because
   brothers supplanted one another, and friends went about fraudulently.
   It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 9:5

   5. And they will deceive every one his neighbour, and will not speak
   the truth: they have taught their tongue to speak lies, and weary
   themselves to commit iniquity.

   5. Et vir proximo sue (socio) mentitur (hoc est, quisque; nam 'ys
   ponitur indefinite apud Hebroeos pro nota universali; quisque ergo
   proximum suum circumvenit, nempe mendacio; nam htl significat mentiri,)
   et veritatem non loquitur; docuerunt linguas suas loqui mendacium (hoc
   est, linguas suas formarunt ad mendacia,) male agere fatigati sunt (hoc
   est, male agendo fatigantur.)


   Jeremiah goes on with the same subject. He says that fidelity had so
   disappeared among the Jews, that every one endeavored to deceive his
   neighbor. Hence it followed, that they were withhout any shame. Some
   sense of shame at least remains among men, when they have to do with
   their own friends; for though they may be wholly given to gain, and to
   indulge in falsehoods, yet when they transact business with friends,
   they retain some regard for equity, and shame checks their wickedness:
   but when there is no difference made between friends and strangers, it
   follows that their character is become altogether brutal. This is what
   the Prophet meant.

   And he adds, that they spoke not the truth He now says that they were
   liars, not in this or that particular business; but that they were
   perfidious and deceitful in everything. This clause then is not to be
   limited to some special acts of fraud; but it is the same as though he
   had said, that they knew not what truth was, or what it was to act with
   good faith and to speak honestly to their neighhours; for they were
   wholly imbued with deceits, and no truth could come out of their mouth.

   And for the same purpose he says, that they had taught their tongues to
   speak falsehood. The expression in this clause is stronger; for he
   means that they were wholly given to deceit, as by long use they had
   formed their tongues for this work. The tongue ought to be the
   representative of the mind, according to the old saying; for why was
   the tongue formed, but in order that men may communicate with one
   another? For the thoughts are hidden, and they come forth when we speak
   with each other. But the Prophet says that the order of nature was by
   them inverted, for they had taught their tongues to lie We also hence
   learn that they had no fidelity whatever; for their very tongues had
   been taught to deceive: as when one by practice has learnt anything, it
   is what he does readily; so when the tongues are formed by continual
   use and inured to lying, they can do nothing else.

   He says at last, that they wearied themselves with evil deeds. This is
   indeed an hyperbolical language; but yet the Prophet very fitly sets
   forth the deplorable state of the people, -- that they practiced the
   doing of evil even to weariness. As when any one is seized with some
   foolish lust, he spares no labor and does himself much harm, but feels
   not his wearied state as long as he is engaged, for his ardor
   dementares him: so he says now, that they were wearied in doing evil.
   When a hunter pursues the game, he undergoes much more labor than any
   common workman, or any husbandman. We see that even kings and
   courtiers, while hunting, are so blinded, that they see no danger nor
   feel any weariness. So we find that men given to pleasure, when lust
   draws them here and there, feel no concern for the greatest weariness.
   According to this sense then the Prophet says, that they were wearied
   in doing evil, as though he had said, that they were so devoted to
   wickedness, that the pleasure of doing evil wholly blinded them and
   made them mad. [238]

   We now perceive the Prophet's meaning: He confirms, as I have said,
   what he had stated before. He had threatened the people with utter
   ruin; they were secure and heedless, and despised all his
   denuncitations. He now shews, from God's nature and office, that ruin
   was nigh them, though they feared it not and thought themselves
   abundantly safe. But if God be the judge of the world, as it will be
   hereafter proved, how is it possible for him to connive perpetually at
   so great wickedness? And to shew this he also adds --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [238] The whole verse may he thus rendered, -- And they deceive, every
   one his neighbor, And the truth they speak not; They have taught their
   tongue the word of falsehood; With perverting have they wearied
   themselves. The verb for "deceive" means to mock, to trifle with, to
   play the fool with. Their object was to befool their neighbors by
   cheating and deceiving them. "The word," or the matter, "of falsehood,"
   is falsehood itself, or sheer falsehood. The Vulgate and the Syriac's
   version is, "They have taught their tongue to speak falsehood." To
   teach the tongue false-hood, was to habituate it to tell lies. The last
   line is differently rendered. The Septuagint deviates far from the
   original. The version of the Vulgate is, "They have labored to act
   unjustly;" and this comes near the meaning; only "to act unjustly" is
   rather to act pervertingly: they wrested and turned everything from its
   right course and meaning; and they labored in perverting things, until
   they wearied themselves. Falsehood requires more labor than truth. --
   Ed.

   Jeremiah 9:6

   6. Thine habitation is in the midst of deceit; through deceit they
   refuse to know me, saith the LORD.

   6. Tu habitas in dolo (hoc est, inter homines dolosos; nam subaudiendum
   est nomen, quemadmodum soepe alibi vidimus genitivum casum poni pro
   epitheto, et subaudiri nomen substantivum; Tu igitur habitas inter
   homines dolosos;) in dolo renuunt cognoscere me, dicit Jehova.


   The Prophet here introduces God as the speaker, that the Jews might
   know that they had not to do with mortal man. For they might, according
   to their usual perverseness, have raised this objection, "Thou indeed
   severely condemnest us, and treatest us reproachfully; but who has made
   thee our judge?" Lest then they should think that the words which he
   had hitherto declared, were the words of man, he interposes the
   authority of God, Thou, he says, dwellest in the midst of a deceitful
   people

   But we must observe that this admonition to the Prophet was necessary
   for two reasons. For when God searches the minds and hearts of men by
   his word, ministers of the word are necessary to exercise this
   jurisdiction, men endued with wisdom, understanding, and prudence. The
   word, says the apostle, is like a two -- edged sword, or it is one that
   cuts on both sides, for it penetrates into the hearts and thoughts of
   man and into their very marrow. (Hebrews 4:12.) We also know what Paul
   says,

   "When an unbeliever comes into your assembly, his conscience is
   searched; so that he will be constrained to fall down and to give glory
   to God." (1 Corinthians 14:24, 25.)

   To the same purpose is this saying of Christ,

   "When the Spirit is come, He will judge the world,"
   (John 16:8)

   for by the Spirit He means the preaching of the Gospel. It is then
   necessary that the ministers of the word, in order that they may
   faithfully and profitably perform their office, should be taught to
   understand the deceits and subterfuges by which men are wont to
   deceive. As then there are many hidden things in the hearts of men, he
   who would effectually teach must know that the innermost recesses of
   the heart must be probed and searched. The Prophet had heard from God
   that the people, over whom He was appointed, were fallacious and filled
   with guiles and frauds: Thou, He says, dwellest in the midst of a
   deceitful people; as though he had said, "Thou hast to do with
   dishonest men, who not only openly betray their wickedness, but also
   deceive when they pretend any repentance or profess obedience to God:
   that they may not therefore weaken or cajole thy resolution by their
   deceptions, settle it in thy mind that thou wilt have to contend with
   their wiles." This is one reason.

   There is another reason; for as God's servants ought to know their
   wiles, which they are bidden to reprove, so there is need of courage
   and perseverance, lest hypocrisy should dishearten them: for such a
   thought as this may occur to the minds of God's servants, "What shall I
   do? for hidden to me are the thoughts of men: now the truth ought to
   penetrate into the whole soul; but I know not what lies hid within in
   any one." Thus pious teachers might be weakened in their efforts and
   disheartened, or wholly discouraged, unless God supported them. It was
   then for this reason that Jeremiah was expressly told, that He had to
   do with a deceitful and false people. [239]

   He afterwards adds, Through guile they refuse to know me God had before
   complained, that he was not known by the people; but he now exaggerates
   their crime by saying, that they craftily evaded every light, as though
   he had said, that they could not plead ignorance or any levity; for
   through guile, says God, they refuse to know me. As they wholly
   flattered themselves with deceptions, they designedly extinguished, as
   far as they could, the light. By guile then he means that obstinate
   craftiness by which the people cast aside every instruction. It
   afterwards follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [239] Houbigant, Horsley, and Venema have suggested emendations as to
   this verse, derived in some measure from the Septuagint. A part of the
   first word, svtk, is connected by the Septuagint with the former verse;
   for it is divided into sv and tk As to this division the preceding
   authors agree; but they differ as to the construction, though mainly
   the same in sense. The most probable is that of Venema, for he only
   divides the word, and gives this version, Burst forth does robbery upon
   robbery, deceit, on deceit;
   They refuse to know me, saith Jehovah. Burst forth, or boil --
   exoestuat, is certainly not the meaning of sv which signifies to
   return, to turn, to restore, etc. Then the rendering would be, Return
   does guile for guile, deceit for deceit. The first word is rendered
   "usury -- tokos" by the Septuagint, but tk means guile or fraud. See
   Psalm 10:7; Psalm 55:12; Psalm 72:14. The meaning is, that their
   dishonest dealings were reciprocal: the cheats cheated one another. Our
   version agrees with the Vulgate and the Syriac, and is adopted by
   Blayney: and he concludes from the end of this verse, that the speaker
   from the 2d verse is not the Prophet, but God; who, adopting the
   language of man, intimates his wish to leave a people so wicked. But
   this conclusion is not necessary; for the prophets often introduce
   sentences of this kind. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 9:7

   7. Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, Behold, I will melt them,
   and try them; for how shall I do for the daughter of my people?

   7. Propterea sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Ecce ego examinabo eos (vel,
   conflabo; ad verbum, examinans, vel, conflans,) et probabo eos; nam
   quomodo agerem cum filia (ad verbum, a facie filiae) populi mei?


   Jeremiah, speaking in God's name, concludes that the chastisement, of
   which he had spoken, was necessary; And what I have already said
   appears more clearly from this verse, -- that he brings to light their
   sins, that they might know that they could not escape God's hand, who
   is a just avenger of wickedness; for they had extremely provoked him by
   their petulance and obstinacy.

   I will try or melt them, he says, and I will prove them As they put on
   a false color, he says that there was a trial needful, as when any one
   shews copper or any other metal for gold, he is disproved by trial. Any
   impostor might otherwise sell dross for silver: the spurious metal,
   that is passed as gold or silver, must be proved; it must be cast into
   the fire and melted. As then the Jews thought that they had honest
   pretences to cover their baseness, God gives this answer, that he had
   yet a way to discover their deceitfulness, and as it were tells them,
   "The goldsmith, when any one brings dross for silver, or copper for
   gold, has a furnace, and he tries it; so will I try and melt you; for
   you think that you can dazzle ray eyes by false pretences: this will
   avail you nothing." In short, God intimates that he had means ready at
   hand to discover their deceitfulness, and that thus their hypocrisy
   would be of no advantage to them, as his judgments would be like a
   furnace. As then stubble or wood, cast into the furnace, is immediately
   burnt, so hypocrites cannot endure God's judgment. They indeed at first
   exhibit some brightness, until God tries them; but their deceits must
   eventually be discovered; and they themselves will be consumed when
   they come to be really proved. This is the meaning.

   And the reason is added, For how should I do with the daughter of my
   people? This may be applied to Jeremiah himself; but it would be a
   strained meaning. He then continues, I have no doubt, to speak in God's
   name; How then should I do, or act, with the daughter of my people? God
   speaks here as one deliberating; and thus he more fully proves the Jews
   guilty; for since he admits them as judges or counsellors, they could
   give no other reply. We hence see that this question is very emphatic;
   for the Prophet intimates, that except the Jews were beyond measure
   stupid, they could no longer flatter themselves in their sins, so as to
   demand to be otherwise treated by God, as they had in so many ways and
   with s.uch perversity procured vengeance for themselves. [240]

   But we hence learn that it is right that judgment should begin at the
   house of God, as it is elsewhere said. (1 Peter 4:17.) God indeed will
   not pass by anytliing without punishing it: hence the heathens must at
   last stand before his tribunal. But as he is nearer to his Church,
   their impiety, who profess themselves to be as it were his domestics,
   is less tolerable, as though he had said, "I have chosen you to be my
   peculiar people, and have taken you under my care and protection; when
   ye become intractable, what remains for me to do, but to try you, as ye
   act so unfaithfully towards me." It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [240] All the ancient versions (except the Vulgate) and the Targum
   read, as though vt "daughter," were rt "wickedness," as in Jeremiah
   7:12. Both Houbigant and Horsley adopt this reading; and the first
   gives the meaning of "thus" to 'yk, and not "how." Then the verse would
   be, Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, -- Behold I will melt them
   that I may try them;
   For thus will I do because of the wickedness of my people. The
   rendering of the last line, according; to the received text, might be
   this, which is nearly the Vulgate, -- For how should I deal otherwise
   with the daughter of my people? The passage runs better in this way,
   than according to the proposed emendation. -- Ed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 9:8

   8. Their tongue is as an arrow shot out; it speaketh deceit; one
   speaketh peacably to his neighbour with his mouth, but in heart he
   layeth his wait.

   8. Sagitta tracta (ut quidam vertunt; alii, occidens) lingua eorum;
   mendacium loquitur; os ejus pacem ad proximum loquetur, et in medio sui
   (hoc est, intra viscera sua, intus) ponet insidias.


   The Prophet again complains of the deceitfulness of their tongues; and
   he compares them to deadly, or drawn out arrows. Gold is said to be
   drawn out, when refined by repeated meltings; so also arrows, when
   sharpened, are more piercing. The Prophet then says, that their tongues
   were like deadly or sharpened arrows: how so? because they ever spoke
   guile, by either slandering or circumventing others. But the expression
   is general; and the Prophet no doubt meant to include all modes of
   deceiving.

   For it afterwards follows, With the mouth they speak peace; that is,
   every one professed friendship, and his words were honey; and yet
   within he did set up, or concealed intrigues. Here in other words he
   sets forth their perfidy; for the tongue and the heart differed. They
   shewed by the tongue what was different from the sentiment of the
   heart. Hence he says, that they set up treacheries in the midst of
   them, or in their hearts, while they spoke peace with the mouth, that
   is, pretended brotherly kindness. [241] At last he repeats again what
   he had said before, (Jeremiah 5:9) --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [241] The word, svcht, means "killing" or slaying; see Genesis 22:10;
   Genesis 37:31; Exodus 12:6. Its primary meaning, as Parkhurst thinks,
   is to shed, or to drain off, either blood from animals, or juice from
   grapes, or gold from dross. But it is used in the sense of slaying. The
   Septuagint and the Vulgate render it here, "wounding," -- A killing
   arrow is their tongue; Deceit it speaks; With his mouth does one speak
   peace to his neighbor, But in his heart he sets an ambush for him.
   Literally, "his ambush," that is, the ambush of which he is the object.
   This form of speech is often in Hebrew. See Job 28:10. "Penit ei
   insidias" is the Vulgate. Blayney gives a paraphrase, not a version, --
   But inwardly will he resolve to fall upon him by surprise. The future
   tense here, as in many other instances, is used as a present tense, and
   designed to shew the habitual practice of the people. The same is done
   in the Welsh language: the future tense is continually used to express
   a present action. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 9:9

   9. Shall I not visit them for these things? saith the LORD: shall not
   my soul be avenged on such a nation as this?

   9. An super hoc non visitabo eos, dicit Jehova? an in gente quae talis
   est (quae est sicut haec) non se ulciscetur anima mea?


   We have already met with this verse; it will therefore be enough
   briefly to refer to what it contains. God shews here, that except he
   denied himself he must necessarily punish the Jews. How so? He takes it
   as granted that he is the judge of the world: he had said that the Jews
   were not only become wicked in one thing, but were so given up to all
   kinds of wickedness, that they wearied themselves; what then was to be
   done? God would not have acted in a manner worthy of himself, nor
   preserved consistency, had he not punished such men; for he must have
   changed his nature, had he not hated such a perverse nation. But he
   speaks after the manner of men when he mentions vengeance; for we know
   that no passions belong to God, as it has been often stated: but as he
   hates wickedness, so he is said to execute vengeance, when he appears
   as a judge and chastises those by whom he has been provoked to wrath.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as we cease not by our sins to provoke thee
   more and more, we may at least be warned by thy threatenings and the
   words of thy prophets, and may not continue obstinate in evil nor
   pertinaciously resist thy will, but that we may on the contrary learn
   to anticipate thy judgment and thus receive thy corrections, so that
   our sins may be hated by us, and that we may become judges of
   ourselves, in order that we may obtain pardon, and that having obtained
   it we may not doubt ever to call on thee as our Father, until thou at
   length gatherest us unto that blessed inheritance, which has been
   procured for us by the blood of thine only Son. -- Amen.

   Jeremiah 9:10

   10. For the mountains will I take up a weeping and wailing, and for the
   habitations of the wilderness a lamentation, because they are burned
   up, so that none can pass through them; neither can men hear the voice
   of the cattle; both the fowl of the heavens and the beast are fled;
   they are gone.

   10. Super montes tollam (vel assumam) fletum et lamentationem, et super
   pascua (vel, loca amoena; alii vertunt, tuguria) deserti planctum; quia
   vastata sunt (alii vertunt, incensa;) ita non sit vir transiens, et non
   audiunt vocem pecudum; ab ave coelorum (hoc est, ab avibus) usque ad
   bestiam migrarunt, abierunt.


   The Prophet had exhorted others to lament and to bewail. He now comes
   forth as though none had ears to attend to his admonition. As then he
   himself undertakes to mourn and to lament, he no doubt indirectly
   condemns the insensibility of the whole people. He saw by the spirit of
   prophecy, that all the rest thought what he said incredible and
   therefore fabulous. For though the kingdom of Judah was at that time
   much wasted, and the kingdom of Israel wholly fallen, they yet
   continued secure and heedless when they ought to have expected God's
   vengeance every day, and even every hour. Since then there was such
   insensibility in the people, the Prophet here prepares himself for
   lamentation and mourning.

   I will take up, he says, mourning and lamentation for the mountains The
   words may be explained, "I will take up mourning, which shall ascend as
   far as the mountains;" but the cause of mourning seems rather to be
   intended; for it immediately follows, and weeping for the pastures of
   the desert Had not this clause been added, the former meaning might be
   taken, that is, that mourning would be so loud as to penetrate into the
   mountains or ascend into the highest parts. But as Jeremiah connects
   the two clauses, for the mountains, and for the pastures of the desert,
   the other meaning is much more appropriate, -- that the confidence of
   the people was very absurd, as they thougilt themselves beyond danger,
   dwelling as they did on the plains; for the enemies, he says, shall
   leave nothing untouched; they shall come to the mountains and to the
   pastures of the desert. It hence follows, that they were foolish who
   promised themselves quietness on the plains, where the enemy could
   easily come.

   We now then understand the Prophet's meaning: he sets here his own fear
   and solicitude in contrast with the stupor of the whole people. I will
   raise, he says, weeping and lamentation for the mountains: but others
   remained secure and thoughtless in their pleasures. He then shews, that
   while they were blind, his eyes were open, and he saw the coming ruin
   which was now at hand. And he sets the mountains and pastures of the
   desert in opposition to the level country. For when a country is laid
   waste, we know that still a retreat is sought on mountains; for enemies
   dread ambushes there, and access is not easy where the roads are
   narrow. Then the Prophet says, that even the mountains would not be
   beyond the reach of danger, for the enemies would march there: he says
   the same of the pastures of the desert. We hence learn how absurd was
   their confidence who thought themselves safe because they inhabited the
   plain country, which was the most accessible.

   As to the word n'vtnaut, it comes from nvhhue, which means to dwell.
   [242] He then takes n'vt haut, as signifying pleasant places, or
   pastures. Some render it sheds or cottages. David uses the same word in
   Psalm 23:2, in speaking of God's favor to him, who was pleased to
   become his shepherd:

   "He makes me to lie down," he says, "in pleasant places."

   But the Prophet no doubt means pastures here. And he calls them the
   pastures of the desert. The word mdvr midbar, we know, is taken to
   designate not only waste and sterile places, but also a mountainous
   country. Though then the richest pastures were on mountains, yet the
   Jews were wont to call them deserts: there is therefore nothing absurd
   in saying, the pleasant places or pastures of the desert. But we must
   bear in mind the contrast, of which I have reminded you: for he
   intended to condemn the foolish confidence of the people, who thought
   that they were dwelling in safety, when yet they were exposed to
   enemies, and had no means to repel or retard their progress.

   Because they are laid waste, He says. This word may be taken in another
   sense, "burnt up;" but it is not suitable here. He says then that these
   places are laid waste, so that no one passed through. He means that
   mountains would not only be without inhabitants, but would be so
   deserted and solitary that there would be none passing over them. There
   would then be none to frequent them. It hence follows, that there would
   be no inhabitants, He then adds, that no voice of cattle was heard; as
   though he had said, that their enemies would take away as their spoil
   whatever should be found there: for the wealth of mountains consists in
   cattle; for there is neither sowing nor reaping there; but inhabitants
   of mountains get their living and whatever is necessary to support
   life, from flesh and skin and milk and cheese. When therefore the
   Prophet declares that there would be no voice of cattle, it is the same
   as though he had said, that the mountains would become altogether
   uninhabited, for their enemies would take away all the cattle found
   there.

   He then adds, From the bird of the heavens to the earthly beast they
   shall migrate and depart [243] Here he seems again indirectly to
   reprove the insensibility of the people, as though he had said, that
   the birds would feel it to be the judgment of God, while yet men were
   wholly insensible; and that there would be a similar feeling in brute
   animals; as though he had said, that there would be more understanding
   in birds and animals than in the Jews, who had not only been created in
   the image of God, but had also been enlightened as to the truth of
   salvation; for shine among them did the truth of God in the law. Hence
   the Prophet shews that this stupidity was most shameful; for they were
   as stupid as if they had no thought and no understanding, while yet
   birds acknowledged the vengeance of God, and brute animals were
   terrified by it. We now perceive the meaning of the Prophet. It follows
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [242] It is not from this root, but from 'vh, to desire, in Niphal,
   n'vh to be desirable. The noun means desirable or pleasant places or
   spots. See Psalm 23:2; Jeremiah 25:37; Joel 1:19. -- Ed.

   [243] The whole verse is as follows, -- 10. For the mountains will I
   raise weeping and wailing, And for the pleasant places of the desert, a
   lamentation; For they are desolate, without any one passing through,
   And they hear not the voice of cattle; From the bird of heaven even to
   the beast, They have migrated, they have gone away. The "pleasant
   places" were "desolate;" and "in the mountains" no "voice of cattle"
   was heard. No one "passing through" explains the desolation. The word
   is improperly rendered, "burnt up," in our version and by Blayney. It
   was used before in the sense of desolation, Jeremiah 4:7; and it ought
   to be so rendered in Jeremiah 2:15. In the last line, the migration
   refers to birds, and the going away to the beasts. In none of the
   ancient versions is this distinction intimated. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 9:11

   11. And I will make Jerusalem heaps, and a den of dragons; and I will
   make the cities of Judah desolate, without an inhabitant.

   11. Et ponam Jerusalem in acervos, in locum draconum; et urbes Jehudah
   ponam vastitatem, ut non sit habitator.


   The Prophet comes now toJerusalem and the neighhouring cities. He said
   before, that ruin would reach the mountains and the farthest recesses;
   but he says now, I will turn Jerusalem into heaps This seemed
   incredible, for it was a well fortified city, and also full of
   inhabitants to defend it: we know besides that the Jews were in
   confederacy with the kingdom of Egypt. This denunciation then was
   extremely unwelcome to the Jews. But though they thought themselves
   hitherto safe, yet the Prophet set before their eyes their final
   destruction. They indeed regarded it as a fable; but they found too
   late, that the despisers of God gain no advantage in hardening·
   themselves against his threatenings. We shall meet with this verse
   again; I shall therefore now pass over it lightly.

   He says, that it would be hereafter a place for dragons; as though he
   had said, that it would be no longer inhabited. He declares the same
   respecting the cities of Judah, -- that they would all be a waste. We
   hence see how courageous and persevering a mind was Jeremiah endued
   with, that he dared to preach thus in the midst of the city, and to set
   himself in opposition to the king and his counsellors, and to the whole
   people, who wished to be soothed with flatteries, and who had been thus
   treated by the false prophets. As then Jeremiah was thus bold, as a
   celestial herald, to denounce on them this dreadful calamity, we hence
   learn that he was endued with the power of God, and that he did not
   speak as one commissioned by men; for had he not been sustained by
   God's power, he must have been a hundred times disheartened, nor would
   he have dared to speak a word. This invincible courage seals his
   doctrine; ibr we hence with certainty learn, that it proceeded from
   God, because the wonderful power of the ttoly Spirit was evident. He
   afterwards adds --

   Jeremiah 9:12

   12. Who is the wise man, that may understand this? and who is he to
   whom the mouth of the LORD hath spoken, that he may declare it, for
   what the land perisheth and is burned up like a wilderness, that none
   passeth through?

   12. Quis vir prudens ut intelligat hoc? (ad verbum, et intelligens,) et
   ad quem loquutum est os Jehovae, ut annunciet quare perierit terra,
   vastata sit instar deserti, ut nemo transeat? (mvly vr absque
   transeunte, ad verbum.)


   Here the Prophet reproves more sharply the insensibility of the people,
   because none attended to the judgments of God; for though they were
   apparent, no one considered them. The question arose from astonishment;
   for it was like something dreadfully monstrous, that so few among the
   people knew that God would be the punisher of crimes so apparent to
   all. Had they a particle of understanding, they must have known that a
   dreadful calamity was nigh at hand, since they continued in so many
   ways to provoke God. And now that the labor of the Prophet, after
   having said what ought to have roused them all, had been all in vain;
   was not this doubly monstrous? For he had spent a long time, and had
   never ceased to cry; and yet all were deaf, nay, his teaching was
   treated with contempt.

   Hence is his astonishment, when he says, Who is a wise man? he
   intimates that there was hardly one in a hundred whom the fear of God
   influenced. It must then be remembered, that the Prophet complains of
   the few number of those who perceived:, that it could not be but that
   God would shortly put forth his hand to punish the wickedness which
   then everywhere prevailed. But yet he exhorts all the faithful children
   of God to disregard the nmltitude, and to gather courage, and to make
   more account of God's word than of the contumacy of them all. There are
   then two things in this sentence; for the question means, that few
   could be found among the people who were wise, and who applied their
   minds and thoughts to consider the miserable state of the people; but,
   on the other hand, he intimates that it is true wisdom in God's
   faithful servants, not to despond, and not to follow the nmltitude. He
   then intimates that they are alone truly wise who consider God's
   judgments before He openly executes them. There is a similar sentence
   in Psalm 107: 43; for the Prophet, after having spoken of God's
   judgments, which are visible through the whole world, exclaims,

   "Who is a wise man, that he may understand these things?"

   as though he had said, that though the works of God, which evidence
   both his goodness and his judgment, might indeed be observed in every
   part of the world, yet that all were blind. The Prophet then by this
   exclamation reprobates the insensibility of men, who overlook God's
   judgments, though they are apparent before their eyes. So also the same
   thing is meant in this place, Who is a wise man? But we must further
   notice the second thing, to which I have referred, namely, that all the
   faithful are here encouraged, as the Prophet teaches us, that this is
   the rule of wisdom, -- to open our eyes to see God's judgments, which
   are hid from the world: while others are drawn away by their lusts or
   sunk in their stupor, the Prophet teaches us, that we are wise, when we
   duly consider, as I have already said, what the Lord has made known to
   us in his word. Hence it follows, that all the wise men of this world
   are foolish, who so harden themselves, that they do not perceive in
   God's word what is yet open to their eyes. Who then is a wise man, and
   he will understand these things?

   He afterwards adds, To whom has the mouth of Jehovah spoken to declare
   this? He complains here that there were no prophets. He said, at the
   beginning of the verse, that there were none wise, because all
   heedlessly despised the threatenings and judgments of God: now in the
   second place he adds, there were none to arouse the careless people who
   were asleep in their sins. But by this sentence he claims authority for
   himself; for though he was without associates and assistants, he yet
   intimates that his teaching was not, on that account of less value: "Be
   it," he says, (for he speaks by way of concession,) "be it, that there
   is no prophet to recall the people from their sins, to exhort them to
   repent, to terrify the ungodly: however this may be, yet the Lord has
   appointed me to teach and to exhort the people." We hence see that the
   Prophet claims for himself full and complete authority, though he alone
   denounced God's vengeance. Many indeed then boasted that they were
   prophets; but they were only false flatterers. When the Prophet saw
   that many abused the name, and did not perform the office faithfully
   and sincerely, he set himself in opposition to them all; as though he
   had said, "It is enough that the Lord has commanded me to do this; I
   therefore denounce on you this calamity, which ye heedlessly disregard,
   because false teachers deeeive you by their mischievous adulations."

   Who will declare, he says, why the land is to perish, and to be laid
   waste like the desert, so that there should be no inhabitant? We may
   apply this to two periods. For when Jeremiah spoke, the kingdom was yet
   standing, and, as I have said, the Jews were not so subdued as to
   humble themselves before God: they were therefore still indulging
   themselves in their sins. Now whence did this indulgence proceed,
   except from their prosperous condition? Yet the Prophet says that the
   land had perished, and justly so; but he says this, because he did not
   judge of the people's state according to what it appeared then to be,
   but according to the judgment which he saw by the prophetic spirit was
   impending over them. And we may extend this farther; as though Jeremiah
   had said, "When God shall have so chastised this people, that there may
   be as it were a visible monument of celestial wrath; there shall yet be
   then no prophets to remind them whence these evils have proceeded."
   This indeed we know was the case, when the city was partly burnt and
   partly demolished, and the temple pulled down: the contumacy of the
   people was so great, that their hearts were stone, and their minds
   iron. There was then a monstrous hardness in that calamity. They indeed
   cried for their evils; but no one perceived that God was executing what
   he had denounced for so many years. For Jeremiah, as we have said,
   exercised his office of teaching for a long time: but before he began,
   Isaiah had already been were out; and before Isaiah, Micah had
   prophesied. Though, however, threatenings had been renewed daily for a
   hundred years, and terrors had been announced, yet there was no one who
   attended. [244]

   This passage, then, may be thus explained, -- That when threatenings
   should appear by the effect not to have been announced in vain, yet the
   people would even then be insensible, for no one would attend to nor
   consider God's judgment: they would all indeed feel their evils, but no
   one would regard the hand of him who smote them, as it is said in
   another place. (Isaiah 9:13.) Either meaning may be allowed; but, as I
   think, the Prophet here deplores the hardness and contumacy of the
   people at that time; as though he had said, that there were none who
   considered God's judgments, and that there was no prophet to rouse
   those who were torpid. But yet, as it has been stated, he thus
   intimates, that he had sufficient authority, though he had no associate
   or assistant; for he had been chosen by God, and had been sent to carry
   this message. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [244] Somewhat a different view may be taken of this verse, as it will
   appear from the following version, -- Who is the man that is wise, And
   he will understand this, -- And to whom the mouth of Jehovah has
   spoken, And he will declare it, -- Even why destroyed is the land, Made
   waste like the desert, without a traveler. The wise man is the same
   with him to whom God had spoken: and what he had to understand and to
   declare was the reason why the land was destroyed. Then in the next
   verse God himself, by the mouth of his prophet, makes this known. "Made
   waste" is rendered "burnt up" by theSeptuagint and the Vulgate, but
   desolated, or desolate, by the Targum, Syriac, and Arabic; and no doubt
   rightly, as "without a traveler," or one passing through, explains what
   is meant: in like manner, "without an inhabitant," in the preceding
   verse, is an explanation of "the cities of Judah" being made
   "desolate," or rather, entirely desolate. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 9:13-15

   13. And the LORD saith, Because they have forsaken my law which I set
   before them, and have not obeyed my voice, neither walked therein;

   13. Et dixit Jehova, Quia dereliquerunt legem meam, quam posui coram
   ipsis (ad faciem ipsorum, ad verbum,) et non audierunt vocem meam, et
   non ambulaverunt in ea (hoc est, secundum ipsam;)

   14. But have walked after the imagination of their own heart, and after
   Baalim, which their fathers taught them:

   14. Et ambulaverunt post cogitationes (vel, post contumaciam; nam
   utroque modo vertunt hoc nomen, post cogitationes ergo) cordis sui, et
   post Baalim, quos docuerunt patres ipsorum:

   15. Therefore thus saith the LORD of hosts, the God of Israel; Behold,
   I will feed them, even this people, with wormwood, and give them water
   of gall to drink.

   15. Propterea sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Deus Israel, Ecce ego cibans
   (cibabo) populum hunc ameritudine, et potabo aquis veneni (vel,
   venenatis; alii vertunt, aquis fellis; nam r's utrumque significat.)


   Jeremiah now confirms what I have stated, and more fully explains it,
   -- that though no teacher or a disciple was found in the land, yet
   there was sufficient power in God's word alone, and that his judgment
   depended not on the will or the perceptions of men. After having then
   complained that all were foolish, and that there were no prophets to
   reprove their security and indifference, he adds, Thus saith Jehovah
   Here he sets God in opposition to all men, to the king and his
   courtiers, as well as to the common people. Who then is a wise man? as
   though He looked around him; and there was no man who considered. he
   was then in suspense; and afterwards he said, "There is no prophet to
   rouse them from their usual stupor." He remained still in suspense; and
   then he turned to God and said, "But Jehovah has spoken;" that is, "Be
   it, that they are like brute beasts, though they arrogate to themselves
   great wisdom; nevertheless God speaks, and we ought to be satisfied. We
   ought then to be silent, and to make no stir; though no one approves,
   though no one attends to God speaking, there is yet sufficient
   authority and power in his voice alone." We now then more fully
   understand the Prophet's design: He had said that all men were stupid,
   and that there was no prophet; and now, on the other hand, he shews
   that God was not silent nor asleep.

   Thus saith Jehovah, Because this people have forsaken my law, etc. He
   shews that the cause of all evils was a departure from God's law. No
   one was willing to confess this, and all the prophets were silent; yet
   Jeremiah says here, that the cause was to be asked of God why he so
   grievously afflicted the people. But he takes as granted what was most
   true, that God was not without reason displeased with the chosen
   people. It hence then follows, that they were apost, ates, and had
   forsaken the law: God would not have otherwise so severely punished
   them. Though then no one perceived the cause of their evils, though no
   one shewed it, yet God himself ought to have been attended to, who
   said, that they had forsaken the law

   He then adds, Which l have set before their face. Here he takes away
   every pretense for ignorance; for they might have objected and said,
   that the doctrine of the law was obscure, and that they were deceived
   through want of knowledge. The Prophet anticipates this objection by
   saying, that the law was set before them; that is, that they were
   abundantly taught what was right, what pleased God; so that they now in
   vain and even falsely pleaded ignorance; for they went astray wilfully
   by closing their eyes against clear light., For this is what he means
   by saying that the law was set before their face: and it is what Moses
   often repeats,

   "Behold, I have set before thee,"
   (Deuteronomy 11:32, and elsewhere:)

   and this he said, that the people might not seek for themselves vain
   excuses for ignorance, as they were wont to do.

   But while we are not to overlook this circumstance, we may yet hence
   learn this general truth, -- that the law of God is not so obscure but
   that we may learn from it what is right. When, therefore, Moses is
   quoted, and the prophets are added as interpreters, there is no ground
   for us to evade, or to make the excuse, that the truth is too hidden or
   profound; for the law is set before our face, that, the will of God may
   be made known to us. Whosoever then can read and hear what God has
   revealed once to the world by Moses and the prophets is inexcusable;
   for we are taught here, and in other places, that it is a mere
   perverseness in all who hear the law, when they do not obey: I have set
   the law, he says, before their face

   And he adds, And they have not hearkened to my voice, and have not
   walked in it He defines what it is not to hearken to his voice: for
   even hypocrites pretend to hear, and nod with their ears like asses;
   but as they obey not God when he speaks, it is evident that they are
   deaf. Hence He says that they walked not in his voice, [245] that is,
   that they obeyed not his voice. He hence concludes that they were deaf;
   for their life ought to have testified that they had heard the voice of
   God speaking to them.

   He then adds, And they have walked after the hardiness, or obstinacy,
   or imaginations, of their own heart [246] He opposes the imaginations,
   or hardness of the heart, to the voice of God, as we find in other
   places, where contrary things are stilted, that is, what men's minds
   devise, and what God shews by his word to be right; for there is no
   less contrariety between the rule of right living and the imaginations
   of men, than there is between fire and water. Let us therefore know,
   that our life cannot be rightly formed except we renounce our own
   imaginations, and simply obey the voice of God: for as soon as we yield
   the least to our own imaginations, we necessarily turn aside from the
   right way, which God has made known to us in his word. This contrast,
   then, between the law of God and the imaginations or the obduracy of
   men ought to be carefully noticed.

   He then more clearly explains how they had sinned, and after Baalim
   [247] The Prophet here adds nothing new; but by specifying one thing he
   shews how the Jews followed their own imaginations, by giving
   themselves up to profane superstitions. What indeed must happen to men,
   when they forsake God, and allow themselves to follow their own
   thoughts? what but error and superstition, yea, the abyss of all
   errors? In short, the Prophet in this clause intended to cut off every
   occasion for subterfuges; for the Jews, like hypocrites, who
   sophistically deal with God, might have made this evasion, and said,
   "Why dost thou object to us our imaginations? what are these
   imaginations?" Baalim, he says, "Ye have devised idols far yourselves
   in addition to the only true God; it is hence quite evident, that
   having forsaken God's word, ye have followed your own imaginations." He
   adds to Baalim, as their fathers have taught them: the relative 'sr,
   asher, is to be taken for k caph, as. [248] I shall speak of this
   clause tomorrow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [245] "Voice" is for God's word; and so the Targum renders it: they did
   not walk in, or according to, his word -- Ed.

   [246] See [8]Note on Jeremiah 3:17, 18.

   [247] It is supposed that the Israelites made a difference between this
   word and God: they allowed but one God, but introduced Baalim, or
   inferior gods, and worshipped them. They tried to evade the charge of
   idolatry, by alleging that Baalim were mediators. But no excuse of this
   kind was admitted, as God everywhere imputed idolatry to them.
   Notwithstanding this example, and the distinct declaration of
   Scripture, that there is but one God and one Mediator, (1 Corinthians
   8:5, 6; 1 Timothy 2:5,) the error, the awful error of praying to
   saints, etc., as mediators, has prevailed in the Christian Church! --
   Ed.

   [248] It makes no difference as to the meaning, but the true
   construction of this clause is as follows, -- Which their fathers have
   taught them. The verb "to teach," in Hebrew as well as in some other
   languages, admits of two objective cases. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast not only testified what is right
   by the Law and the Prophets, in order that we may form our life in
   obedience to thy will, but hast also made more fully known to us by thy
   Gospel what is perfect righteousness, -- O grant, that being ruled by
   thy Spirit, we may surrender ourselves altogether to thee, and so
   acquiesce in thy Word alone, that we may not deviate either to the
   right hand or to the left, but allow thee alone to be wise, and that
   acknowledging our folly and vanity, we may suffer ourselves to be
   taught by thy Word, so that we may really prove that we are truly
   obedient to thee, until having at length completed the course of this
   life, we shall reach that heavenly rest which has been obtained for us
   by the blood of thine only-begotten Son. -- Amen.

   Lecture Thirty-Seventh

   We explained yesterday what the Prophet said respecting the Jews, that
   though no one considered the reason why God so severely afflicted them,
   yet they could not escape in this way, and that they in vain set up the
   shield of iglnorance, for God had often declared that he abominated
   their superstitions. Though then they were all blind, and no prophet
   shewed to them the cause of their evils, yet Jeremiah said, that this
   alone was sufficient -- that God had spoken, and would again speak to
   them. He said that they were not submissive to God's authority, but
   walked after the hardness of their own heart, and after Baalim. He
   added, that they had been thus taught by their fathers By this clause
   he exaggerated their sin; for they did not then begin for the first
   time to sin, but became obstinate in their vices.

   We may learn from this passage how foolishly the Papists now glory in
   imitating the fathers: for they think that examples stand for laws;
   nay, they hesitate not to oppose. God's authority by what has been done
   by men. But we see that such an excuse is not only frivolous, but that
   thereby the crime is doubled; for more excusable is the ignorance of
   one year, or of a short time, than when there is a long obstinate
   persistency in it, and when children, after having embraced
   abominations, received from their fathers, hand them down to their
   posterity.

   He at length concludes that God would take vengeance, but speaks in a
   figurativle language, I will feed them with bitterness The word lnh
   lone, is rendered "wormwood;" but as this is a wholesome herb, I prefer
   to render it "bitterness." [249] It is never found in a good sense, and
   therefore unsuitable to the nature of wormwood, which is often
   mentioned by Moses: and the other prophets (Deuteronomy 19:18;
   Deuteronomy 32:32; Hebrews 2:15.) Hence I am inclined to adopt a
   general term, "bitterness." He then adds, I will give them poisonous
   waters to drink; [250] as though God had said that he would execute a
   dreadful vengeance, so that it would appear in the meat and drink given
   them, which yet were remarkable testimonies of his paternal kindness
   towards them: for we cannot eat a crumb of bread nor drink a drop of
   water, except God's goodness, and the care which he takes for our
   safety, shines upon us. Hence is that awful imprecation in Psalm 69:22,
   23,

   "Turned let their table be into an offense."

   David also complained, when describing the barbarous cruelty of his
   enemies, that they gave him gall to drink: and we shall hereafter see
   what Jeremiah says; for in speaking. of his enemies, he says that they
   had conspired to put him to death, and said,

   "Let us set wood for his bread." (Jeremiah 11:19)

   By these words then Jeremiah intended to express the dreadful vengeance
   of God; for he would not onty deprive the Jews of his benefits, but
   also turn their bread into poison, and their water into bitterness.

   We now then perceive the Prophet's meaning; and at the same time we
   must observe the expression, the God of Israel The foolish boasting,
   that they were the descendants of Abraham, and that they were a holy
   people, chosen by God, always deluded the Jews. In order then to check
   their glorying, the Prophet says, float the God who spoke to them was
   the God whose name they falsely professed, and that he was the God who
   had chosen the children of Abraham as his peculiar people. It follows
   --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [249] But the reason why this herb is mentioned is its bitterness, --
   and not its wholesome effects. It was hence chosen to designate what is
   afflictive and distressing. This appears from. Proverbs 5:4, "bitter as
   wormwood." -- Ed.

   [250] See [9]note on Jeremiah 8:14.

   Jeremiah 9:16

   16. I will scatter them also among the heathen, whom neither they nor
   their fathers have known; and I will send a sword after them, till I
   have consumed them.

   16. Et dispergam eos inter gentes, quas non noverunt ipsi, neque patres
   eorum, et mittam post eos gladium, donec consumpsero ipsos.


   As he had said that the Jews were following what theyhad received from
   their fathers, so he says now that God would scatter them among
   nations,which had been unknown to them and to their fathers. He then
   alludes to their mischievous tradition; for the fathers had imbued
   their children with ungodly errors, and had withdrawn them from God,
   that their doctrine might become altogether familiar to them. There is
   then a contrast to be noticed between the knowledge with which the
   fathers had inebriated their children, and their ignorance of the
   language of the nations.

   And then as he had said, that they were walking after the hardness of
   their own heart and after Baalim, he says, I will send a sword after
   them We hence see that the Prophet in both clauses alludes to the
   defection of which he had spoken. And he adds, Until I shall have
   consumed them; and this is added, that they might not promise
   themselves a temporary or a moderate chastisement. Jeremiah then
   declares, that as they had abused God's forbearance, destruction was
   nigh them, and that God would contimle to consume them, until he had
   wholly destroyed them. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   Jeremiah 9:17-18

   17. Thus saith the LORD of hosts, Consider ye, and call for the
   mourning women, that they may come; and send for cunning women, that
   they may come:

   17. Sic dicit Jehova exercituum, Attendite et votate lamentatrices, ut
   veniant, et ad peritas mittite ut veniant:

   18. And let them make haste, and take up a wailing for us, that our
   eyes may run down with tears, and our eyelids gush out with waters.

   18. Et festinent et tollant super nos luctum, et descendant oculi
   nostri in lachrymas, (alii vertunt, descendant cum lachrymis, vel,
   emittant lachrymas,) et palpebrae nostrae defluant in aquas.


   In this passage, as in many others, the Prophet endeavors by a striking
   representation really to touch the hearts of his people, for he saw
   that they were extremely refractory, insensible, and secure. Since then
   the threatenings of God were either wholly despised, or had not
   sufficiently moved the hearts of the people, it was necessary to set
   forth God's judgments as present. Therefore the Prophet gives a
   striking description of what takes place in times of mourning. At the
   same time he seems to condemn indirectly the Jews for not knowing,
   through God's word, that there was a calamity at hand: for God's word
   ought indeed to be like a mirror, by which men ought to see God's
   goodness in his promises and also his judgment in his threatenings. As
   then all prophecies were deemed as fables by the people, it was not
   without some degree of derision that he addressed them in this manner,
   --

   Hearken ye, and call for mourners, that they may come An absurd and a
   foolish custom has prevailed almost in all ages to hire women as
   mourners, whom they called proeficoe; they were employed to mourn for
   others. Heirs no doubt hired these foolish women, in order to shew
   their reigned piety; they spoke in praise of the dead, and shewed how
   great a loss was their death. The Prophet does not commend this custom;
   and we ought to know that Scripture often takes similes from the vices
   of men, as from filth and dirt. If then any one concludes from these
   winds of Jeremiah, that lamentations at funerals are not to be
   condemned, this would be foolish and puerile. The Prophet, on the
   contrary, does here reprove the Jews, because they heedlessly
   disregarded all God's threatenings, and were at the same time soft and
   tender at those foolish exhibitions, and all mourned at the sight of
   those women who were hired to lament; as the case is at this time, when
   a faithful teacher reprobates the prevailing folly of the Papists. For
   when the unprincipled men, who occupy the pulpits under the Papacy,
   speak with weeping, though they produce not a syllable from God's word,
   but add some spectacle or phantom, by producing the image of the Cross
   or some like thing, they touch the feelings of the vulgar and cause
   weeping, according to what actors do on the stage. As then the Papists
   are seized as it were with an insane feeling, when their deceivers thus
   gesticulate, so a faithful teacher may say to them, "Let any one come
   and set before your eyes the image of a dead man, or say, that you must
   all shortly die and be like the earcase shewn to you, and ye will cry
   and weep; and yet ye will sot consider how dreadful God's judgment is,
   which I declare to you: I shew to you faithfully from the law, from the
   prophets, and from the Gospel; how dreadful is God's vengeance, and set
   before you what ye deserve; yet none of you are moved; but my doctrine
   is a mockery to you, and also my reproofs and threatenings: go then to
   your prophets, who shew you pictures and the like trumperies." So the
   Prophet says now, "I see that I can do you no good; the Lord will
   therefore give you no teachers but women." Of what sort? Even such, he
   says, as lament, or are hired to mourn.

   We now then perceive why the Prophet speaks of hired women. Attend ye,
   he says; and why? They ought indeed to have been attentive to or to
   understand (for vn ben, means properly to understand, and in Hithpael
   it signifies to consider) his words; but as he saw that he was
   ridiculed or despised, and that all the threatenings which proceeded
   from God were esteemed as fables, he now says, "Consider ye and call
   for your lamenters: -- as I see such perverseness in you, be taught at
   least by those women who are commonly invited to lament, and who sell
   their tears!" Send, he says, for the skilfu1, that they may come By
   these words he intended more clearly to express, that the calamity
   which the people feared not was not far distant.

   Let them, he says, take up for us a wailing, and let our eyes come down
   to tears, and let our eyelids flow down into waters These are
   hyperbolical words, and yet they do not exceed the intensehess of the
   coming vengeance: for it was not in vain that he said at the begSnning
   of the chapter, "Who will make my head waters, and my eyes a fountain
   of tears?" As then the greatness of the calamity could be expressed by
   no words, the Prophet was constrained to adopt these hyperbolical
   expressions: Let them then take up for us a wailing, that our eyes may
   come down to tears: and this he said, because he saw that he was heard
   with dry eyes, and that the people disregarded what had been
   denounced:, when yet all ought to have been smitten with fear, from the
   least to the greatest. As then the Prophet saw that their contempt was
   so brutal, he says, that when lainenters came, there would then be the
   time for wailing, not indeed the seasonable time; but it is the same as
   though he had said, that the Jews would then find out how insensible
   they had been, in not having in due time considered the judgment of
   God. [251] It follows --

   Jeremiah 9:19

   19. For a voice of wailing is heard out of Zion, How are we spoiled! we
   are greatly confounded, because we have forsaken the land, because our
   dwellings have cast us out.

   19. Quia vox luctus audita est ex Sion, Quomodo perditi (aut, vastati)
   sumus? pudefacti valde? quia dereliquimus terram, quia projecerunt
   habitacula nostra (quidam subaudirent, projecerunt nos.)


   We have said before, that when Jeremiah addressed the people in these
   words, they were still in a tolerably good condition, so that the king
   had confidence in his own resources; and his counsellors also thought
   that some aid would come to them from Egypt, and the people were
   likewise deceived. But the Prophet speaks of future events and points
   out as by the finger the evils which were as yet concealed from the
   view; for he could not otherwise teach with any authority, as he had to
   do with men of iron hearts. As then he saw that his teaching had no
   effect, and was wholly disregarded by men so slothful, he felt it
   necessary to form his style so as to touch their feelings.

   On this account he says, that a voice was heard, a voice of wailing
   from Sion; where yet all exulted with joy. Then he adds, How have we
   been destroyed! and made greatly ashamed! The Jews thought this a
   fable, until they found by experience that they had been extremely hard
   and obstinate: but this really happened. Though they were then
   indulging in their pleasures, he yet proclaims lamentations to them, as
   though they were already destroyed: A voice, he says, has been heard,
   as though the Jews were bewailing the calamity, respecting which they
   thought the Prophet was fabling, for no danger was yet apparent.

   But in order, as I have said, to condemn the hardness of their hearts,
   he represents them in another character, as bewailing their ruinous
   condition, and saying, We have left the land; in which however they
   thought their dwelling would be perpetual; for they boasted that they
   could never be excluded, as it had been declared,

   "This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell, for I have chosen it."
   (Psalm 132:14.)

   As then God had testified that it would be a quiet habitation to his
   people, they thought that they were fortified by a triple wall and
   rampart, and that the city was altogether unassailable. But Jeremiah
   represents them as saying, that they had left their own land, that is,
   that they had been drawn and driven into exile. Then he adds, because
   they have cast us out This seems to refer to their enemies who had cast
   them out, that is, pulled down their dwellings. Some take dwellings to
   be the nominative case to the verb, "Our dwellings have cast us out."
   [252] But the first meaning reads better: I therefore consider the
   sense to be simply this, -- that they were cast out and that their
   houses were destroyed by their enemies. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [252] The true version is that given by Blaney and approved by Horsley,
   -- Because they have thrown down our habitations. The ancient versions
   differ, but none give the meaning of our version, which is that of
   Junius and Tremelius. The whole verse is in the past tense: things are
   represented as having already taken place: -- For the voice of wailing
   has been heard from Sion, -- "How have we been plundered! We have been
   put to great shame; For we have left the land, For they have thrown
   down our habitations." The people are set forth as assembled in
   Jerusalem, having been made to quit the land, their dwellings having
   been pulled down. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 9:20-21

   20. Yet hear the word of the LORD, O ye women, and let your ear receive
   the word of his mouth, and teach your daughters wailing, and every one
   her neighbour lamentation.

   20. Itaque audite mulieres sermonem Jehovae, et percipiant aures
   vestrae sermonem oris ejus, et docete filias vestras luctum, et
   unaquaeque (mulier, ad verbum) sociam (vel, propinquam) suam planctum:

   21. For death is come up into our windows, and is entered into our
   palaces, to cut off the children from without, and the young men from
   the streets.

   21. Quia ascendit mors in fenestras nostras, intravit in palatia nostra
   ad excidendum infantem e platea (e via publica) electos (hoc est
   adolescentes, etiam in flore oetatis et vigore) in compitis.


   He proceeds with the same subject, but adopts another figure. He then
   somewhat changes the comparison; for he had bidden them before to hire
   women to excite to mourning by fictitious tears, but he now addresses
   women in general; as though he had said, that such would be the
   mourning, that hired lamentations would not be sufficient, for the
   calamity would touch all hearts, and that mercenary wailing would not
   be real. Hear, he says, ye women

   Why he addresses women may be accounted for in two ways: the softness
   of women more easily leads them to weep; there may be also here an
   indirect condemnation of the men, that they were deaf and so hardened
   that no threatenings terrified them. But the first seems to be the most
   suitable reason here, provided we still understand that real mourning
   is opposed to reigned mourning. Then Jeremiah passes from the
   particular to the general; that is, after having spoken of hired women,
   he now includes all women; for lamentation would prevail in every city,
   and also in every house: Hear then, ye women, the word of Jehovah

   And he adds, and let your ears receive the word of his mouth He
   mentions on the one hand the mouth of God, and on the other the ears of
   women. It seems indeed a redundancy, but the repetition is not
   superfluous. Had he said only, "Let your ears hear the word of his
   mouth," there would have been a redundancy; but he spoke before only of
   the word of God, and hear ye; now he adds, the mouth of God, and the
   ears of women. The Prophet no doubt intended to rebuke that hardness
   which we have often noticed. The word of God was deemed of no moment;
   hence he says, the mouth of God: as though he had said, "God speaks
   with you as it were from mouth to mouth: for though he employs my
   labor, I am yet but his instrument; so that you may easily find out
   that I declare nothing presumptuously, but faithfully deliver what I
   have received from him." We hence see how emphatical is this
   repetition, which may seem at first sight to be superfluous. The same
   emphasis belongs to the ears of women; it is as though he had said,
   that they had been hitherto extremely indifferent, and that it was time
   for their ears to be attentive.

   He adds, And teach your daughters; as though he had said, that such
   would be the wailing, that it would reach not only the old and the
   middle-aged, but even young girls, as yet rude and ignorant. And let
   every one, he says, teach her neighbor lamentation In short, the
   meaning is, that no women, old or young, would be exempt from this
   mourning, as all would be implicated in a common sorrow; for God's
   judgment would reach every age, sex, and order of men, and would also
   penetrate into every house.

   And by way of explanation he adds, For death has ascended into our
   windows There is here a kind of derision; for the Jews, as it has been
   said, had falsely promised to themselves a perpetual impunity; and
   therefore the Prophet adopts here a most suitable comparison. For as
   they sleep securely, who with closed doors seem to themselves to be
   beyond the reach of danger; so the Jews at that time despised God and
   all his judgments, as though the doors of their houses were closed.
   Hence the Prophet says, that death had entered in through the windows;
   and he thus derides their folly for thinking that they could escape the
   hand of God, because their gates were shut, as though. God's power
   could not ascend above the clouds nor enter through their windows, when
   the doors were closed. In short, he intimates that the doors would not
   be opened by God; for though he might not be disposed to break them, he
   could yet immediately ascend into the windows. We now apprehend the
   Prophet's design in saying, that death had entered through the windows.

   And what he adds respecting palaces bears the same import; as though he
   had said, "Were our houses even fortified, and were they not. only
   commodious habitations, but made like citadels, yet God could not be
   excluded; for his power can penetrate through the highest and the
   thickest walls, so that a palace is to him like the weakest and
   frailest cottage." We hence see that by this comparison he checks that
   foolisll confidence by which the Jews had deceived themselves, and by
   which they were as yet inebriated. Death then has ascended into our
   windows, etc.

   He then adds, To cut off the young, or children, from the public ways,
   and the youths from the streets [253] By these words he sets forth the
   dreadfulness of the calamity; for the youths would not be able to
   defend themselves by their own strength; for by vchvrym, bechurim, he
   means the most robust. Even these would not be able to repel the onset
   of their enemies; though in the flower of their age, yet their rigor,
   however strong, would not protect them, nor would children and infants
   be spared. We see that two things are here set forth by the Prophet, --
   that the assaults of their enemies would be so violent, that young men
   would in vain resist them, as their vigor would avail them nothing, --
   and then that such would be the cruelty of their enemies, that no
   regard would be shewn for age, for they would put to death even infants
   newly born. It follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [253] The objection, that there is an inconsisteney in saying that
   death entered through the windows to cut off children from the street,
   disappears, when we consider that the Jews thought themselves safe
   because their gates were closed and their city fortified. Be it so,
   says the Prophet, yet death will enter, if not through the gates, yet
   through the windows, and through our towers, and it will destroy the
   children who play in our streets, and our young men assembled in the
   squares and the wide places of our city. That those collected at
   Jerusalem are here meant, is evident from the nineteenth verse. Then,
   in the next verse, he refers to those who still continued in the
   country. And this accounts for the change made in the sentence, which
   has puzzled some expounders, and induced them to propose emendations.
   The verse may be thus rendered, -- For climbed has death through our
   windows, It has come through our towers,
   To cut off the child from the street, The young men from the broad
   streets. Though the gates were closed, yet death came in, not only
   through windows, or any openings there might have been, but also
   through strong towers. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 9:22

   22. Speak, Thus saith the LORD, Even the carcases of men shall fall as
   dung upon the open field, and as the handful after the harvestman, and
   none shall gather them.

   22. Loquere, Sic dicit Jehova, Cadet cadaver hominis, tanquam stercus
   in superficie agri, et tanquam manipulus a tergo messoris, et nemo
   colligens.


   Though Jeremiah continues the same subject, he yet introduces a
   preface, -- that he had been commanded to declare what he says here;
   for on account of the strangeness of the event, the prophecy seemed
   incredible. He might, indeed, have proceeded with the subject, and
   omitted the words, "Thus saith Jehovah," and have begun thus: "Fall
   shall the carcase of man," etc. But, as I have said, this prophecy
   seemed to the greatest part as worthless, as though it was a fable: it
   was therefore necessary to introduce these words, -- that he came forth
   furnished with God's command; and he at the same time shews that he
   introduced nothing of his own, but that God himself spoke. We now
   perceive why these few words were introduced. [254]

   He afterwards says, that the carcases of men would be cast forth as
   dung He speaks by way of reproach, as though he had said, that all
   would without honor be laid prostrate by their enemies. And he adds a
   similitude, They shall fall, he says, on the face of the field, that
   is, everywhere through all the fields shall they fall as dung, which is
   cast forth, and which excites nausea by its sight and by its odor. Thus
   the Prophet here denotes foetor and a deformed sight by the comparison
   of dung: yet we know with what pride were they then filled. This
   threatening then was to them very disagreeable; but as they flattered
   themselves in their vices, it was the more necessary to treat them
   roughly; for thus ought hypocrites to be dealt with, who indulge their
   own delusions: the more boldly they rise up against God, the more
   violently ought they to be east down, so that they may at length humble
   themselves under the mighty hand of God.

   He adds another comparison, As a handful, etc. Jerome renders it "hay."
   If myd omid, were found elsewhere in this sense, I would willingly
   adopt this meaning; but I rather think that it means those ears of corn
   which are not gathered while the reapers collect their handfuls. They
   do not, indeed, leave complete handfuls, nor east them away; but it
   happens, through carelessness, that a few ears escape them. Then the
   Prophet says, that the Jews would be like those ears of corn which the
   reapers pass by and leave behind; and there is no one afterwards to
   gather them: and those ears of corn which thus remain in the field
   either rot of themselves, or are devoured by cattle or wild beasts. He
   then means, that there would be no residue of the people, for all, from
   the least to the greatest, would be given up to destruction.

   This is the meaning; and at the same time he expresses contempt; for
   when reapers do not collect the whole produce of the field, there are
   still the poor, who gather the ears of corn; but when they are trodden
   under foot, and when there is no one to gather them, it betokens
   contempt; and this is what the Prophet intended to express. It now
   follows --
     __________________________________________________________________

   [254] Blayney and some others connect dvr with the former verse, and,
   on the authority of the Septuagint, leave out "thus saith Jehovah." The
   Vulgate and the Targum retain the text as we have it, and the Syriac
   omits only the first word; and there is no MS. in favor of what has
   been proposed; and the meaning, as here represented by Calvin, is so
   evident, that no change is at all necessary, -- 22. Speak, Thus saith
   Jehovah, Fall also shall the carcase of man, Like dung on the face of
   the field, Or like an handful of corn after the reaper, And without any
   to gather it. This would be the fate of such as remained in the
   country, whilst the greatest part had fled into Jerusalem. It is by
   keeping this distinction in view that the whole passage, from verse the
   seventeenth, may be rightly understood. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 9:23-24

   23. Thus saith the LORD, Let not the wise man glory in his wisdom,
   neither let the mighty man glory in his might, let not the rich man
   glory in his riches:

   23. Sic dicit Jehova, Ne glorietur sapiens in sapientia sua, et ne
   glorietur fortis in fortitudine sua; ne glorietur dives in divitiis
   suis:

   24: But let him that glorieth glory in this, that he understandeth and
   knoweth me, that I am the LORD which exercise lovingkindness, judgment,
   and righteousness, in the earth: for in these things I delight, saith
   the LORD.

   24. Sed in hoc glorietur qui gloriatur cognoscendo et sciendo me, quod
   ego sum Jehova, faciens misericordiam, (vel, clementiam) judicium et
   justitiam in terra; quia in his complacuit mihi, dicit Jehova.


   This is a remarkable passage, and often found in the mouth of men, as
   other notable sentences, which are known as proverbial sayings: but yet
   few rightly consider how these words are connected with the previous
   context. Hence there are many who are satisfied with a simple
   explanation, as though it were a subject abruptly introduced, and as
   though the Prophet commenced something new; and they confine themselves
   to those words: and thus they misrepresent the meaning of the Prophet,
   or at least diminish much of the force of what is taught.

   The Prophet no doubt has a regard to what has gone before. He saw, as I
   have often said, that he addressed the deaf; for the Jews were so
   swollen with false confidence, that the word of God was regarded
   worthless by them. As then some were proud for their riches, and others
   thought themselves more prudent than that they could by any means be
   taken, and others thought themselves so fortified by wealth and power,
   that they could easily resist any evil, -- as then the minds of all
   were possessed with so much pride, the Prophet, in order to confirm
   what he had said, declares here that men foolishly gloried, while they
   set up their riches, or their strength, or their wisdom, in opposition
   to God; for all these things would vanish away like smoke.

   We now then perceive why the Prophet forbids here any to glory except
   in God alone, and how the passage ought not to be deemed as abrupt, but
   connected with what he said, when he denounced destruction on the Jews,
   which yet they dreaded not, because they were filled with this ungodly
   and foolish conceit, -- that they had more than a sufficient protection
   in their own strength, or riches, or wisdom. The rest to-morrow.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that since thou settest before our eyes so many
   evils and vices by which we have provoked thine anger against us, and
   yet givest us the hope of pardon if we repent, -- O grant us a
   teachable spirit, that we may with becoming meekness attend to thy
   threatenings, and be in such a way territlcd by them as not yet to
   despair of the mercy offered to us, but seek it through thy Son: and as
   he has once for all pacified thee by shedding his blood, so cleanse
   thou us also by thy Spirit from all our pollutions, until we at length
   stand immaculate before thee in that day when Christ shall appear for
   the salvation of all his people. -- Amen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Lecture Thirty-Eighth

   We began yesterday to explain what the Prophet means, when he forbids
   men to glory either in wisdom, or in strength, or in riches. The
   meaning is, that all are greatly deceived who think themselves blessed
   while alienated from God. We have also noticed the reason why he speaks
   of wisdom, strength, and riches, even this, -- because it is a vice
   innate in all mortals to be proud of their own excellency. Whatever we
   think valuable ought to be acknowledged as received from God. If then
   all the excellency we have is God's gift, it is very strange that we do
   not learn humility when God thus binds us to himself; but that, on the
   contrary, we abuse his bounty by making it the occasion of pride. This
   ingratitude has nevertheless ever prevailed in the world. This then is
   the reason why the Prophet here reduces to nothing all the boastings of
   the world. There were among the Jews some rich, others excelled in
   wisdom, and others in power: thus it happened, that heavenly truth was
   of no value in their esteem. As then some trusted in their riches and
   not. in God, and others in their wisdom, and others in their valor, the
   Prophet here declares that all the glory they arrogated on account of
   God's temporal gifts, was all nothing. It remained then for the Jews to
   consider, that all such confidences would avail nothing against God's
   judgment.

   But we may hence learn a general truth; and Paul no doubt had a regard
   to this passage in 1 Corinthians 1:31. He teaches us there, that God
   chooses what is foolish in the world, that he might thus shame the
   wisdom of the world, and that he chooses what is weak, that he might
   upset the strength of the world; and then he adds, That whosoever
   glories must glory in God alone. He doubtless took this passage from
   the Prophet; and yet he does not only speak there of strength of body,
   nor of riches, nor of worldly wisdom; but includes also righteousness,
   and whatever is deemed valuable or honorable among men. His object,
   then is to annihilate every glory that belongs to the flesh, that the
   mercy of God alone may shine forth. Hence I said, that though the
   Prophet mentions only three things, yet a generaal doctrine may hence
   be suitably drawn; for what is said of wisdom, strength, and riches,
   may and ought to be applied to that false conceit of righteousness with
   which hypocrites swell. We shall now consider the words.

   Thus saith Jehovah, Let not the wise glory, etc [255] By way of
   concession he calls those wise who were without the fear of God, which
   yet we know is the beginning of wisdom. (Psalm 111:10; Proverbs 1:7.)
   But the Prophet speaks according to the common opinion; and the meaning
   may be thus given, "Let; not him who seenas wise to himself glory in
   his own wisdom:" and so the other words may be understood. It is then
   added, But let him who glories, glory in this, etc. It appears from the
   second verse, that men are not so stripped of all glory, that they may
   be down in disgrace; but that they may seek a better glory, for God
   detights not in the degradation of men. But as they arrogate to
   themselves more than what is right, and even inebriate themselves with
   delusions, he strips them naked, that after having known that all they
   think they have, either from nature, or from themselves, or from other
   creatures, is a mere phantom, they may seek true glory.

   He afterwards adds, In understanding and knowing me Though by these two
   word the Prophet means the same thing, yet they are not used without a
   design; for as men despised the knowledge of God, it was necessary to
   remind them, that to know God is the chief part of perfect wisdom. He
   therefore intended to correct the mischievous error under which almost
   the whole world labors; for while all attend to wxrious pursuits, the
   knowledge of God is neglected. We see with what ardor every one pursues
   his own fancies, while hardly one in a hundred deigns to spend half an
   hour in the day in seeking the knowledge of God. And there is also
   another evil, a false opinion, which proceeds from pride, -- that to
   know God is a common thing. We hence perceive why the Prophet has
   employed these two words to designate the same thing; it was to rouse
   more fully the attention of men; for he saw that almost all were torpid
   and indifferent on a subject which is justly entitled to the labor of a
   whole life; nay, were a hundred lives given us, this one thing would be
   sufficient to engage our attention. But, as it has been said, what
   ought to be preferred to all other things is despised and neglected.

   He afterwards adds, That I am Jehovah, who doeth judgment. By calling
   himself Jehovah, he doubtless excludes all those devices which then
   engaged the attention of the Jews; for the whole land was corrupted by
   so many superstitions, that the name of the only true God was unknown.
   They all, indeed, professed to worship the God of Abraham, who had
   delivered to them his law by the hand of Moses; but as many errors were
   mingled with the true doctrine, God was deprived of his own honor. It
   was, then, God's will that he should be so known as to appear alone
   supreme, and to be alone as it were kept in view. But the explanation
   which follows ought to be carefully observed; for had he said only,
   "Let every one who glories, glory in the knowledge of me, that I am
   Jehovah," it would, indeed, have been a plain truth, but not
   sufficiently persplcuous or evident; for the minds of men might have
   been in suspense, and they might have said, "What does this mean? or,
   why is it, that God regards the knowledge of himself to be so
   important? They might also have supposed that it was quite enough to
   confess him to be the only true God. Hence God here reminds the Jews of
   his own divine perfections, that they might really know that he is God,
   and that they might not ascribe to him an empty name. It was for this
   reason that I have said, that these words, who doeth mercy and
   judgement and justice, ought to be carefully observed.

   We see at this day, under the Papacy, that the name of God is
   presumptuously gloried in: there is no one who is not ready boldly to
   declare that he worships the one true God, and yet they profane his
   name; for they afterwards rob God, and bestow the spoils on the dead.
   This passage then teaches us, that the name of God of itself would be
   of no importance, if stripped of his power and perfections. Hence we
   have then only the true knowledge of God, when we not only acknowledge
   him to be the creator of the world, but when we also fully believe that
   the world is governed by him, and when we further understand the way in
   which he governs it, that is, by doing mercy and judgment and justice

   Now, the first thing respecting God is, that we should acknowledge him
   to be beneficient and bountiful; for what would become of us without
   the mercy of God? Therefore the true and right knowledge of God begins
   here, that is, when we know him to be merciful towards us. For what
   would it avail us to know that God is just, except we had a previous
   knowledge of his mercy and gratuitous goodness? We cannot know God
   without knowing ourselves. These two things are connected. Now, if any
   examines himself, what will he find but what will make him to despair?
   Thus, whenever God is thought of, we feel a dread, and despair in a
   manner swallows us up. In short, all avoid God, except the sweetness of
   his grace allures them. Why? Because, as I have said, there is nothing
   but what brings misery to us, and a cause of dread. Hence Jeremiah,
   while bidding men to glory in the knowledge of God, has not in vain
   given the first and the highest place to his mercy.

   He afterwards adds, Judgement and justice When these two words are
   joined together, they denote perfect government; that is, that God
   defends his faithful people, aids the miserable, and delivers them when
   unjustly oppressed; and also that he restrains the wicked, and suffers
   them not to injure the innocent at their pleasure. These then are the
   things which the Scripture everywhere means by the two words, judgment
   and justice. The justice of God is not to be taken according to what is
   commonly understood by it; and they speak incorrectly who represent
   God's justice as in opposition to his mercy: hence the common proverb,
   "I appeal from justice to mercy." The Scripture speaks otherwise; for
   justice is to be taken for that faithful protection of God, by which he
   defends and preserves his own people; and judgment, for the rigor which
   he exercises against the transgressors of his law.

   But, as I have already said, judgment and justice, when found together,
   are to be taken for that legitimate government, by which God so
   regulates the affairs of the world, that there is nothing but what is
   just and right: and hence is confirmed more fully what I have already
   stated, that he not only speaks generally, but intends also to remove
   the evils which then stood in the way, and prevented the Jews from
   rightly receiving either promises or threatenings; for a false glory
   inebriated them all, inasmuch as one thought his riches to be like an
   invincible fortress; another, his wisdom; and the third, his strength.
   As then they were full of vain pride, and thus despised God and his
   heavenly truth, it was necessary to bring them to order, and even
   wholly to strip them, that they might know that they were not to glory
   in anything but in the knowledge of God.

   Now, the knowledge mentioned here produces two fruits, even faith and
   fear; for if we are fully, persuaded that there is propitiation with
   God, as it is said in Psalm 130:4 we recumb on him, and hesitate not to
   flee to him, and to place our salvation in his hand. This is one thing.
   Then faith brings fear, as it is said in the psalm referred to,

   "There is propitiation with thee, that thou mayest be feared."

   But the Prophet here distinctly refers to these two things; for God, by
   expressing his will to be known as being merciful, doubtless encourages
   us to exercise faith, so that we may call on him witIx tranquil minds,
   and not doubt but he is propitious to us; for he looks not on what we
   are, in order to repay to us wlmt we deserve, but deals graciously with
   us according to his mercy: and by saying that he doeth judgment and
   justice, he intimates, that these two things ought to dispose and turn
   our hearts to fear and reverence. At the same time, when God declares
   that he doeth justice, He supplies us with a reason for confidence; for
   he thus promises to be the guardian of our salvation: for, as I have
   said, his justice is not to render to every one his just reward, but is
   to be extended further, and is to be taken for his faithfulness. As
   then God never forsakes his own people, but aids them in due time, and
   restrains the wicked, he is on this account called just: we hence can
   then more securely, and with quieter minds, recumb on him, when we know
   that his justice is such, that he will never leave us destitute of help
   whenever necessary.

   He afterwards adds, For in these I delight, saith Jehovah This refers
   to men; as though God had said, that he hated all who pass by the
   knowledge of his mercy, judgment, and justice, and become ferocious and
   elated with a vain hope on account of riches, or of strength, or of
   wisdom, according to what is said in Psalm 147:10,

   "The strength of a horse pleases not God, nor is he delighted with the
   legs of a man;"

   as though he had said, that God hates that confidence by which men
   presumptuously extol themselves, while they think their life and their
   safety to be in their own hand. So also, in this passage, there is a
   contrast to be understood between the knowledge of God's mercy,
   judgment, and justice, and the wisdom, strength, riches, and the
   foolish glorying, by which men are inflated, when they seek in these
   their happiness. [256]

   We now also more clearly see what I have before said, -- that not only
   condemned in these words is the boasting of human power, and the
   glowing in wisdom and in wealth, but that men are wholly stripped of
   all the confidence they place in themselves, or seek from the world, in
   order that the knowledge of God alone may be deemed enough for
   obtaining perfect happiness. For the Prophet shews, with sufficient
   clearness, that all men without God are miserable: it hence follows,
   that they are not otherwise happy but in him. Then the way and manner
   is to be added. How are we made happy in God? Even by knowing his mercy
   towards us, and then by delivering up ourselves to his defense and
   protection, and by suffering ourselves to be ruled by him, and by
   obeying also his law, because we fear his judgment. This passage might
   indeed be more fully handled; but it is enough for me, according to my
   custom, to point out the main things. It now follows --

     __________________________________________________________________

   [255] The next sentence is, "the valiant in his valor:" so the Vulate;
   but by the Septuagint "the strong (ischuros) in his strength;" by the
   Syriac, "the giant in his strength." The Targum gives this paraphrase
   of the verse, "Thus saith the Lord, Let not Solomon, the wise son of
   David, delight in his wisdom; nor Sampson, the valiant son of Manoah,
   delight in his valor; nor Ahab, the rich son of Omri, delight in his
   riches." It is military valor that is probably meant. They thought that
   they had wisdom in counsel, valor in defense, and wealth to procure
   aid, or to carry on war. -- Ed

   [256] Blayney and Venema agree with Calvin in thinking that "these"
   refer to such men as knew God and trusted in him, and not to "these"
   things, the mercy, judgment, and justice before mentioned. The versions
   and the Targum are ambiguous, like the Hebrew, except the Vulgate, in
   which "these" is in the neuter gender, referring to things, and not to
   men. I would render the verse thus, -- But in this let him glory who
   glories, That he understands, and that he knows me, -- That I am
   Jehovah, Who doeth mercy, judgment, and justice in the land; For in
   these have I delighted, saith Jehovah. "Me" is left out in the
   Septuagint, the Syriac, and the Arabic. "That he knows me" is only a
   more clear enunciation of the previous words, "that he understands:"
   what he understands or knows is then stated, "That I am," etc.
   "Judgment," when connected with justice, seems to refer to what the law
   forbids; and "justice," to what the law enjoins. See Isaiah 56:1, where
   the command is, to "keep" or observe "judgment," and to "do" or execute
   "justice." God doeth judgment in that he doeth nothing wrong, contrary
   to what is right and just; and he doeth justice in the defence of what
   is right and just, and in making good what he hath promised. Judgment
   regards the negative part of the law, and justice the active part. In
   Jeremiah 22:3, we find both words, "judgment and justice," or
   righteousness. Then, as it is usual with the prophets, the last is
   described first, "delivered is the spoiled:" afterwards judgment is set
   forth, it does "no wrong," etc. But it is only when the two words occur
   together that they have these specific meanings; for both, occurring
   separately, have a much wider import. They are used together more than
   twenty times. -- Ed.

   Jeremiah 9:25-26

   25. Behold, the days come, saith the LORD, that I will punish all them
   which are circumcised with the uncircumcised;

   25. Ecce dies veniunt, dicit Jehova, ut visitem (ad verbum, et
   visitabo) super omnem circumcisum in praeputio.

   26. Egypt, and Judah, and Edom, and the children of Ammon, and Moab,
   and all that are in the utmost corners, that dwell in the wilderness:
   for all these nations are uncircumcised, and all the house of Israel
   are uncircumcised in the heart.

   26. Super Egyptium (vel, super Egyptum; tam de terra quam de hominibus
   potest accipi) et super Jehudah, et super Edom, et super omnes filios
   Amon, et super Moab, et super omnes finitos in angulo (alii vertunt,
   attonsos comam, sed nulla ratio apparet) habitantes in deserto; quia
   omnes gentes incircumcisae (vel, praeputiatae) et tota domus Israel
   praeputiati sunt corde (vel, incircumcisi.)


   The Prophet, after having removed the obstacle which he saw hindered
   the Jews from reverently receiving the truth of God, now speaks more
   sharply, and performs the office of a herald in denouncing the
   vengeance which was at hand: Behold, he says, come shall the days, in
   which I will visit all the uncircumcised in uncircumcision

   This passage admits of two meanings. Some interpreters take as distinct
   these two words, mvl mul, the circumcised, vrlh, beorle, in
   uncircumcision; as though Jeremiah had said, "I will visit the Jews,
   who are circumcised, as well as the heathen nations, who are
   uncircumcised," Others read them jointly, -- that God threatens
   vengeance on the Jews and Gentiles, because they were circumcised, and
   still retained uncircumcision. The passage may however be thus suitably
   explained, -- that there was a mixture, which corrupted the sacredness
   of circumcision, and made it like the uncircumcision of the Gentiles;
   as though it were thus expressed, "I will visit the circumcised with
   the uncircumcision," that is, promiscuously and without any difference,
   as we say in our language, Pele mele. For it follows afterwards, that
   all were uncircumcised in heart; that is, all the Jews. We hence see
   that the Prophet makes circumcision and uncireumcision the same, and
   that he intended to render profane the sacred symbol of adoption;but he
   had reference to the Jews, who, being degenerated, thus adulterated
   God's covenant, and at the same time violated circumcision, so that in
   differed nothing from uncircumcision. I therefore think, that the Jews
   are classed with the Gentiles, so that he ascribes even to them
   uncircumcision: I will then visit all the circumcised with the
   uncircumcision; that is, the circumcision of each is vain, and is like
   uncircumcision.

   However this may be, the Prophet here denounces ruin, not only on the
   Jews, but also on the Egyptians and on other neighboring nations; but
   he yet speaks to his own people, for his word was not destined for the
   Egyptians, nor for the Idumeans and the Moabites. But as the Jews were
   wont to have recourse to the Egyptians, when any danger arose from the
   Assyrians and Chaldeans, the Prophet here connects the Egyptians with
   the Jews, and for the same reason, the other nations. We indeed know
   that the Idumeans and the Moabites were most hostile enemies to the
   Jews; but as the state of things changed, they were at one time their
   enemies, at another their friends; and when they saw that the Chaldeans
   extended their power, they saw also that they were exposed to plunder,
   and hence it happened that they willingly helped the Jews. Since then
   the Hebrews hoped that their neighbors on every side would aid them,
   the Prophet says that a visitation was nigh them all: and hence is
   confirmed what I have already said; for he distinguishes not the Jews
   from the Egyptians and other nations; but, on the contrary, as they had
   made alliances with them, he intends to unite them in one body: I will
   visit, he says, the circumcised with the uncircumcision For the Jews
   did not bear in mind that God was the protector of their safety, and
   that they had been set apart by him from other nations. He names the
   circumcised together with the uncircumcision, because the Egyptians,
   the Idumeans, the Ammonites, and the Moabites, were deemed circumcised
   on account of the covenant they had made with the Jews; and the Jews
   were deemed uncircumcised, because they had forsaken God, and thus
   profarted themselves.

   It is indeed true that the Idumeans were circumcised, for they were the
   descendants of Esau, and had no doubt retained this external symbol;
   but their circumcision was altogether a mockery, as Esau had departed
   from the Church of God. The circumcision of the elect people was in
   itself efficacious; but as they had alike fallen into superstitions,
   they were like the uncircumcised, according to what Paul says, -- that
   the letter of the circumcision, that is, the external rite, was
   nothing. We hence see that there is no common propriety in the
   Prophet's words, when he denounces vengeance on the Jews as well as on
   the Egyptians, and names the circumcised with the uneircumcision; for
   the latter had uncircumcision, the former circumcision, and thus they
   had blended profane and sacred things together, so that there was
   nothing pure or uncorrupted: and hence he mentions Egypt, Judah, Edom,
   the children of Ammon, and Moab We have before stated why he enumerated
   all these nations; he did so, because they expected help from one
   another, so that they all despised God.

   He afterwards adds, And all the extreme ones in a corner The word qph,
   kots, means the end; hence they take qtsvtsym, kotsutsim, here for
   extremities: and ph'h pae, signifies a corner, and an end. We might
   then, if propriety of language would bear it, render the words thus,
   "the cornered in the corner." But the meaning is by no means ambiguous,
   which is, that though the Moabites and others had hidden recesses, they
   could not be exempt from the calamity. God's vengeance shall come, says
   Jeremiah, into their farthest corners, where they think that they dwell
   in safety. And what follows is explanatory, the inhabitants of the
   wilderness, or, those who dwell in the wilderness. He thus shews what
   he meant by qtsvtsy ph'h kotsutsi pae, the extremities, of the corner.
   For when people inhabit remote places, they regard themselves on that
   account safer, being secure in their hiding -- places: this confidence
   the Prophet derides; and he says that punishment would reach them also.
   [257]

   He then adds, For all the nations are uncircumcised, and the whole
   house of Israel is uncircumcised in heart By saying, that all nations
   were uncircumcised, he doubtless includes the Israelites, and thus by
   way of reproach he takes away from the chosen people their peculiar
   distinction; as though he had said, that Israel was so mixed with the
   nations, that they only made a part of them: the Jews would have
   otherwise denied, that they deserved to be classed with the Gentiles;
   but the Prophet deprives them of every excuse, and says that they were
   but one nation, having no difference: All these nations then are
   uncircumcised And so h He, before gvym guim, nations, may be taken as a
   demonstrative pronoun, and not a relative, "All these nations." He had
   spoken not only of the Egyptians and the Idumeans and of other
   neighboring nations, but had also mentioned Judah. He then says, "All
   these nations are uncircumcised:" and as I have already said, he
   condemns Israel, because they differed nothing from the nations, though
   God had consecrated them to himself; for there was an entire mingling,
   which made them all equal.

   But as some objection might still be alleged, he says, the Jews are
   uncircumcised in heart He had indeed already included them in the
   nations; but it was necessary to insist more on this point, for
   circumcision might have been pleaded by them. Hence the Prophet says,
   that though they had the visible symbol in the flesh, they were yet
   uncircumcised in heart, and ought therefore to be classed with the
   nations. We see how sharply he reproves them: though he separates them
   from other nations, he yet shews that they justly deserved to be
   numbered with them; for God cares not for the external symbol, but
   regards the chief thing, the circumcision of the heart.

   It is a common thing with Moses and the Prophets to call an unrenewed
   heart, uncircumcision, and to say that the people are uncircumcised in
   heart: for circumcision, while an evidence of free salvation in Christ,
   at the same time initiated the Jews into the worship and service of
   God, and proved the necessity of a new life; it was in short a sign
   both of repentance and of faith. When, therefore, the Jews presented
   only the sign, they were justly derided by Moses and the prophets; for
   they seemed as though they sought to pacify God by a thing of nought,
   without regarding the end. The same is the case now when we boast of
   baptism alone, and are at the same time destitute of repentance and
   faith: our boasting is absurd and ridiculous. And hence Paul calls the
   external rite, when the sign is separated from its reality and
   substance, the letter of the circumcision; and on the other hand he
   calls that the true circumcision, which is in secret and in the spirit.
   We may also say the same of baptism, -- that the literal baptism avails
   hypocrites nothing, for they receive only the naked sign: and therefore
   we must come to the spirit of baptism, to the thing itself; for the
   interior power is renovation, when our old man is crucified in us, and
   when we rise again with Christ into newness of life.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [257] The exposition of the phrase given in this section is
   inconsistent with all the ancient versions and the Targum: it is what
   has been given by modern rabbins. "The shaven around the face," is the
   Septuagint; "the shaven as to the hair," the Vulqate and the Targum;
   and to the same purpose is the Syriac and Arabic. The word ph'h is used
   in Leviticus 19:27, with distinct reference to the side or corner of
   the head, and of the beard; and the Israelites were forbidden to
   imitate the nations who shaved off those parts. Parkhurst renders the
   phrase (which occurs also in Jeremiah 25:23, and in Jeremiah 49:32)
   "trimmed on the sides," that is, of the head; more literally, "the
   shaven on the side," that is, of the head, or, "on the corner," that
   is, of the beard. It was a phrase, though defective, yet no doubt well
   understood, as it is the case in other languages. The design of
   mentioning these seems to have been to class together such as had been
   expressly separated. I propose the following as the version of the two
   verses, -- 25. Behold the days are coming, saith Jehovah, That I will
   visit every one circumcised, Who is in uncircumcision, -- 26. The
   Egyptians and Judah, Edom also and the children of Ammon and Moab, And
   all the shawn on the side of the head, Who dwell in the desert; For all
   these nations are uncircumcised; And all the house of Israel, -- They
   are uncircumcised in heart. It is justly remarked by Horsley that the
   nations here mentioned practiced circumcision. They were hence
   circumcised, and yet in uncircumcision; and the Jews were like them:
   and the last line explains this apparent contradiction: they had the
   outward but not the inward circumcision. -- Ed.

   PRAYER

   Grant, Almighty God, that as thou hast revealed to us in thy Gospel how
   guilty and miserable we are, we may learn to loathe ourselves, ard so
   He down confounded and despairing on account of the sins and guilt we
   have contracted, as yet to know that true glory is offered to us, and
   that we can be made partakers of it, if by true faith we embrace thy
   only-begotten Son, in whom is offered to us perfect righteousness and
   salvation: And grant also that we may so cleave to Christ, and so
   receive by faith his blessings, that we may be able, not only before
   the world, but also against Satan and death itself, to glory in thee,
   that thou alone art just and wise and strong; and may thy strength and
   justice and wisdom shine forth upon us in our iniquity and ignorance
   and infirmity, until we shall at length reach that ruiness of glory,
   which has been prepared for us in heaven by Christ our Lord. -- Amen.

   A TRANSLATION OF

   CALVIN'S VERSION OF

   JEREMIAH

   CHAPTERS 1--9
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 1

   1 The words of Jeremiah, the son of Hilkiah, one of the priests who
   were in Anathoth, in the land of Benjamin:

   2 Even the word of Jehovah came to him in the days of Josiah, the son
   of Amon, The king of Judah, in the tenth year of his reign;

   3 And it came in the days of Jehoiakim, the son of Josiah, the king of
   Judah, to the end of the eleventh year of Zedekiah, the son of Josiah,
   the king of Judah, to the transmigration of Jerusalem in the fifth
   month.

   4 And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, --

   5 Before I formed thee in the womb, I knew thee; Before thou camest
   forth from the womb, I sanctified thee; A prophet to the nations have I
   made thee.

   6 And I said, -- Ah! Lord Jehovah, Behold, I know not how to speak, for
   I am a child.

   7 And Jehovah said to me, -- Say not, I am a child; For wheresoever I
   send thee, thou shalt go; And whatsoever I command thee, thou shalt
   say:

   8 Fear not their face, for I am with thee, To deliver thee, saith
   Jehovah.

   9 And Jehovah extended his hand and touched my mouth; and Jehovah said
   to me, -- Behold, I have put my words in thy mouth;

   10 See, I have set thee today Over nations and over kingdoms, To pull
   down and to destroy, To root up and to demolish, To build and to plant.
   (1:47)

   11 Then the word of Jehovah came to me saying, What seest thou,
   Jeremiah? And I said, The rod of a watcher is what I see.

   12 Then Jehovah said to me, Thou hast rightly seen, for I watch over my
   word to do it.

   13 And the word of Jehovah came to me again, saying, What seest thou?
   And I said, A pot boiling is what I see; its face is towards the north.

   14 And Jehovah said to me, -- From the north shall break forth an evil
   On all the inhabitants of the land:

   15 For behold, I am calling all the families Of the kingdoms of the
   north, saith Jehovah; And they shall come, and set shall each his
   throne, At the entrance of the gates of Jerusalem, And on all its walls
   around, And on all the cities of Judah:

   16 And I will execute my judgments on them For all their wickedness;
   Because they have forsaken me, And have burnt incense to strange gods,
   And bowed down to the works of their own hands. (1:58)

   17 Thou then, gird thy loins and arise, And speak to them whatsoever I
   command thee; Fear not their face, Lest I dismay thee before them.

   18 And I, behold I have made thee this day A fortified city, an iron
   pillar, And a brazen wall, as to the whole land, Against the kings of
   Judah, Against his princes, against his priests, Against the people of
   the land:

   19 And they shall fight with thee, But shall not prevail over thee, For
   with thee am I, saith Jehovah, to deliver thee.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 2

   1 And the word of Jehovah came to me, saying, --

   2 Go and cry in the ears of Jerusalem, Saying, Thus saith Jehovah, -- I
   remember thee for my kindness to thine youth And my love at thy
   espousal, When thou didst follow me in the desert, In a land not sown.
   (1:70)

   3 Holiness was Israel to Jehovah, The first-fruits of his increase:
   Whosoever devour him shall be punished, Evil shall come upon them,
   saith Jehovah.

   4 Hear the word of Jehovah, ye house of Jacob, And all the families of
   the house of Israel:

   5 Thus saith Jehovah, -- What iniquity did your fathers find in me? For
   they alienated themselves from me, And walked after vanity, and became
   vain; (1:75)

   6 And they said not, "Where is Jehovah, Who brought us out of the land
   of Egypt, And led us through the wilderness, In a land waste and
   rugged, In a land horrible and deadly, In a land through which none
   passed, And in which no man dwelt?" (1:79)

   7 And I brought you into a fertile land, To eat its fruit and its
   abundance; But ye entered and polluted my land, And my heritage have ye
   made an abomination:

   8 The priests said not, "Where is Jehovah?" And they who handled the
   law, knew not me; And the pastors dealt treacherously with me, And the
   prophets prophesied by Baal, And after things which did not profit,
   they walked.

   9 Therefore still will I contend with you, saith Jehovah; And with your
   children's children will I contend.

   10 For pass over to the isles of Chittim, and see; And to Kedar send,
   and consider diligently; And see whether such a thing as this has been
   done --

   11 Has a nation changed its gods, Though they are no gods? Yet my
   people have changed their glory Unto that which does not profit.

   12 Be astonished, ye heavens, at this, and terrified, Be ye wholly
   desolated, saith Jehovah: (1:92)

   13 Surely, two evils have my people done, -- Me have they forsaken, the
   fountain of living waters, And dug have they for themselves cisterns,
   Broken cisterns, which hold no waters!

   14 Is Israel a servant? Is he one born in the house? Why is he become a
   prey?

   15 Over him roar the lions, They have raised their voice; They have
   made his land waste; His cities are burnt up, Without an inhabitant.

   16 Even the children of Noph and Thaphanes Do break thy crown.

   17 Hast thou not done this for thyself, By forsaking Jehovah thy God,
   While he was leading thee in the way?

   18 And now what hast thou to do in the way to Egypt, That thou mightest
   drink the waters of the Nile? And what hast thou to do in the way to
   Assyria, That thou mightest drink of the water of the river?

   19 Chastise thee shall thine own wickedness, And thy apostasies, they
   shall punish thee; And thou shalt understand and know, That it is an
   evil and a bitter thing for thee To have forsaken Jehovah thy God, And
   that my fear has not been in thee, Saith the Lord, Jehovah of hosts.

   20 For of old have I broken thy yoke, Have I burst thy bands; But thou
   hast said, "I will not serve;" For on every high hill and under every
   shady tree Hast thou rambled like a harlot. (1:107)

   21 I indeed planted thee a choice vine, Altogether a good seed; How
   then art thou turned to me A degenerated foreign vine!

   22 Even though thou washest thyself with nitre, And multipliest to thee
   the herb of the fuller; Yet imprinted is thine iniquity Before my face,
   saith the Lord Jehovah.

   23 How canst thou say, "I am not polluted, After Baalim have I not
   gone?" See thy ways in the valley, Know what thou hast done, -- Thou
   swift dromedary, traversing her ways, --

   24 A wild she-ass, used to the desert, In her own lust snuffing up the
   wind she meets with: Who can thence bring her back? Whosoever seeks
   her, needs not weary himself; In her month will he find her. (1:118)

   25 Keep thy foot from being unshod, And thy throat from thirst: Yet
   thou hast said, "It is all over, No, for I have loved strangers, And
   after them will I go."

   26 As there is shame to a thief when caught, So ashamed shall be the
   house of Israel, Their kings and their princes, Their priests and their
   prophets, --

   27 Who say to the wood, "My father art thou;" And to the stone, "Thou
   hast begotten me:" For they have turned to me the back, not the face;
   But in the time of their calamity they say, "Arise and save us."

   28 But where are thy gods, Which thou hast made for thyself? Let them
   arise, if they can save thee In the time of thy calamity; For according
   to the number of thy cities Have been thy gods, O Judah!

   29 Why do ye contend with me? Ye have all dealt perfidiously with me,
   saith Jehovah.

   30 In vain have I chastised your children; Correction they received
   not; Devoured has the sword your prophets, As a destroying lion.

   31 O generation! see ye the word of Jehovah; Have I been a desert to
   Israel, or a land of darkness? Wherefore have my people said, -- "We
   have ruled, we will come no more to thee." (1:135)

   32 Can a maid forget her ornaments, A spouse her attire? But my people
   have forgotten me, Days without number.

   33 Why trimmest thou thy ways to seek love? Thou hast even thus taught
   wickedness by thy ways.

   34 Even in thy skirts is found The blood of the souls of the poor
   innocents; Not in digging under have they been found, But on account of
   all these things: (1:143)

   35 Yet thou hast said, "Surely I am clean; Only let his fury depart
   from me." Behold I will contend with thee in judgment, Because thou
   hast said, "I have not sinned."

   36 Why ramblest thou so much to change thy ways? Even of Egypt shalt
   thou be ashamed, As thou hast been ashamed of Assyria.

   37 Even now for this thou shalt go forth, And thine hands on thine
   head; For abhorred hath Jehovah thy confidences, And in them thou shalt
   not prosper. (1:151)

   CHAPTER 3

   1 It is said, when a man puts away his wife, And she goes from him to
   another man, Shall he return to her again? Would not the land be thus
   greatly polluted? But thou hast played the harlot with many friends;
   Yet return to me, saith Jehovah.

   2 Raise thine eyes to the high places, And see where thou hast played
   the harlot: By the ways thou didst sit for them, As the Arabian in the
   desert; And polluted hast thou the land With thy whoredoms and thy
   wickedness.

   3 Restrained therefore have been the showers, And the late rain has not
   been; Yet the front of a strumpet has been thine, Thou hast refused to
   be ashamed.

   4 Wilt thou not hereafter cry to me, -- "My Father, the guide of my
   youth art thou?

   5 Will he keep wrath for ever? Will he reserve it perpetually?" Behold,
   thou hast spoken, And hast done evils with all thy might. (1:162)

   6 And Jehovah said to me in the days of Josiah the king, -- Hast thou
   seen what the apostate Israel has done? She went on every high mountain
   And under every shady tree, And played there the harlot:

   7 And I said, after she had done all these things, "Return to me;" but
   she returned not; And see this did her perfidious sister Judah.

   8 And I saw, that when for all these things, Because rebellious Israel
   had played the harlot, I had dismissed her and given her a bill of
   divorce, Yet fear did not her perfidious sister Judah, But went and
   played also the harlot. (1:166)

   9 And it happened through the levity of her whoredom, That she polluted
   the land, And played the harlot with stone and with wood.

   10 And yet after all this, returned to me Has not her perfidious sister
   Judah, With her whole heart, but feignedly, saith Jehovah.

   11 And Jehovah said to me, -- Justified herself has apostate Israel
   Rather than perfidious Judah:

   12 Go and publish these words towards the north, And say, Return,
   rebellious Israel, saith Jehovah; I will not let fall my wrath upon
   you, For I am merciful, saith Jehovah; I will not keep it for ever:

   13 But know thine iniquity, That against Jehovah thy God thou hast
   acted wickedly, And prostituted thy ways to strangers Under every shady
   tree; (1:176) And to my voice thou didst not hearken, saith Jehovah.

   14 Return, ye rebellious children, saith Jehovah; For I am your
   husband; And I will take you, one from a city, And two from a family,
   and bring you to Sion;

   15 And will give you pastors according to my heart, And they shall feed
   you with knowledge and understanding.

   16 And it shall be, when ye shall multiply and increase In the land, in
   those days, saith Jehovah, That they will no more say, -- "The ark of
   the covenant of Jehovah;" And it shall not come to mind, And they shall
   not remember nor visit it; Even this shall not be done any more.
   (1:185)

   17 At that time they shall call Jerusalem, The throne of Jehovah; And
   assemble to it shall all nations, For the name of Jehovah, even to
   Jerusalem; And walk shall they no more After the evil hardness of their
   own hearts. (1:186)

   18 In those days shall come The house of Judah with the house of
   Israel; Together shall they come from the land of the north, To the
   land which I have given For an inheritance to your fathers.

   19 But I said, How shall I put thee among the children, And give thee
   the desirable land, The heritage coveted by hosts of nations? And I
   said, "My Father," shalt thou call me, And from me thou wilt not
   depart. (1:189)

   20 Surely as a woman deals perfidiously with her partner, So hast thou
   dealt perfidiously with me, O house of Israel, saith Jehovah.

   21 A voice on high places was heard, The weeping of the prayers of the
   children of Israel; Because they had perverted their way, And forgotten
   Jehovah their God. (1:192)

   22 "Return, ye rebellious children, I will heal your transgressions."
   "Behold we come to thee, For thou art Jehovah our God:

   23 Surely deceit is from the hills, From the multitude of mountains;
   Surely, in Jehovah our God Is the salvation of Israel. (1:194)

   24 Even shame hath devoured the labor Of our fathers, from our youth,
   Even their sheep and their cattle, Their sons and their daughters.

   25 We have lain down in our shame, And our reproach hath covered us,
   Because with Jehovah our God We have dealt wickedly, we and our
   fathers, From our childhood even to this day, (1:196) And have not
   attended to the voice of Jehovah our God."

   CHAPTER 4

   1 If thou wilt return, Israel, saith Jehovah, Return to me; Even if
   thou wilt take away Thine abominations from my sight, And wilt not
   wander: (1:199)

   2 And thou shalt swear, "Live does Jehovah, In truth, in judgment, and
   in righteousness;" Then bless themselves in him shall nations, And in
   him shall they glory. (1:202)

   3 For thus saith Jehovah To the men of Judah and to Jerusalem, --
   Plough again the first ploughing, And sow not among thorns:

   4 Be ye circumcised to Jehovah, And take away the foreskin of your
   heart, Ye men of Judah and inhabitants of Jerusalem; Lest my fury go
   forth like fire, And burn that none may quench it; On account of the
   evil of your doings.

   5 Proclaim ye in Judah, And publish in Jerusalem, and say, "Sound the
   trumpet in the land;" Call, assemble, yea, say, -- "Be assembled, and
   let us enter into fortified cities;"

   6 Raise the standard in Sion; Flee, stay not, for an evil do I bring
   From the north, even a great ruin. (1:208)

   7 Ascended has the lion from his thicket, And the waster of nations is
   gone forth; He is come forth from his place, To make thy land a waste;
   Thy cities shall be destroyed, So as to be without an inhabitant.

   8 For this gird yourselves with sackcloth, Lament and howl; for turned
   away from us Is not the fury of Jehovah's wrath.

   9 And it shall be in that day, saith Jehovah, That perish shall the
   heart of the king, And the heart of the princes; And amazed shall be
   the priests, And the prophets shall be astonished. (1:212)

   10 Then I said, Ah! Lord Jehovah! Surely, deceiving thou hast deceived
   This people and Jerusalem, by saying, "Peace shall be to you;" Yet
   reached has the sword to the soul. (1:214)

   11 At that time it shall be said To this people and to Jerusalem, -- A
   dry wind from the heights of the desert Shall be towards the way of the
   daughter of my people, Not to fan nor to cleanse;

   12 A wind stronger than this shall come for me; Now also will I
   pronounce judgments on them. (1:217)

   13 Behold as clouds shall he ascend, And as a whirlwind his chariots;
   Swifter than eagles his horses: Woe to us! for we are lost.

   14 Cleanse from evil the heart, Jerusalem; That thou mayest be saved:
   How long will remain within thee The thoughts of vanity! (1:221)

   15 For a voice proclaims from Dan And publishes ruin from Mount
   Ephraim.

   16 Rehearse it to the nations; Behold, publish against Jerusalem, --
   Besiegers come from a remote land, And raise over the cities of Judah
   their voice;

   17 As keepers of the field they shall be over her around; Because she
   hath provoked me, saith Jehovah.

   18 Thy way and thy doings have done this for thee; This is thy
   wickedness, though it be bitter, Though it reaches to thy heart.
   (1:227)

   19 My bowels! my bowels! I am in pain; The walls of my heart! My heart
   is in a tumult within me; I will not be silent, for the sound of the
   trumpet Has my soul heard, And the clamor of war has it heard. (1:229)

   20 Calamity on calamity is cried; For destroyed is the whole land;
   Suddenly destroyed are my tents, In an instant my curtains.

   21 How long shall I see the standard -- Shall I hear the sound of the
   trumpet?

   22 Because foolish are my people, Me have they not known; Sottish
   children are they, And they are not intelligent; Acute are they for
   evil, But how to do good they know not.

   23 I beheld the land, and lo, it was waste and without form; And the
   heavens, and they had no light:

   24 I beheld the mountains, and lo, they trembled; And all the hills
   were shaking:

   25 I beheld, and lo, there was no man, And every bird of the heavens
   was fled:

   26 I beheld, and lo, Carmel was a desert; And all its cities were
   destroyed, At the presence of Jehovah, At the presence of the burning
   of his wrath.

   27 For thus saith Jehovah, Laid waste shall be the whole land; But an
   end will I not make.

   28 For this mourn shall the land, And black shall become the heavens
   above; For I have spoken, I have purposed, And will not repent nor be
   turned from this.

   29 At the voice of the horseman and of the bowmen, Flee shall the whole
   city; They shall penetrate into thick clouds, They shall ascend into
   rocks; Every city shall be forsaken, And no man shall dwell in them.
   (1:245)

   30 And thou, wretched one, what wilt thou do? Though thou puttest on
   crimson, Though thou deckest thyself with ornaments of gold, Though
   thou adornest with paint thine eyes, In vain wilt thou decorate
   thyself; Hate thee will thy lovers, Thy life will they seek.

   31 Surely, the voice of one in travail have I heard, The distress as of
   one giving birth to a first-begotten, The voice of the daughter of
   Sion; Who mourns, who spreads her hands, -- "Wo to me now! for fainted
   has my soul On account of murderers." (1:251)
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 5

   1 Go round through the streets of Jerusalem, And see, I pray, and know,
   Inquire also in its cross-ways, Whether ye shall find a man, Whether
   there be any, who doeth judgment, Who seeketh the truth, And I will
   spare it. (1:252)

   2 Though they say, "Live does Jehovah;" Yet in this they swear falsely.

   3 Jehovah! are not thine eyes on the truth? Thou hast smitten them, But
   they have not grieved; Thou hast consumed them, But they have not
   received correction: They have made their faces harder than a rock,
   They have refused to return.

   4 But I said, Surely the poor are these; They have acted foolishly,
   Because they knew not the way of Jehovah, The judgment of their God:

   5 I will go to the great and speak to them, For they know the way of
   Jehovah, The judgment of their God: But these have altogether broken
   the yoke, They have burst the bonds.

   6 Therefore smite them shall the lion from the forest, The wolf of the
   desert shall spoil them, The leopard shall watch over their cities;
   Whosoever goeth out shall be torn: For manifold are their
   transgressions, Increased are their defections.

   7 How for this shall I spare thee? Thy children have forsaken me, And
   have sworn by one that is not a god; When I fully satisfied them, they
   committed adultery, And at the house of the harlot they assembled:

   8 Fed horses! rising early in the morning, Every one at his neighbor's
   wife neigheth.

   9 Should I not for these things visit? saith Jehovah, And on such a
   nation as this Shall not my soul be avenged?

   10 Ascend her walls and demolish, But an end make not; Take away her
   foundations, For they are not Jehovah's:

   11 For by transgressing they have transgressed against me, The house of
   Israel and the house of Judah saith Jehovah.

   12 They have denied Jehovah and said, "He is not, and come on us shall
   no evil; Yea, the sword and the famine we shall not see:

   13 And the prophets shall be wind, For the word is not in them: Thus
   shall it be done to them."

   14 Therefore, thus saith Jehovah, the God of hosts, -- Because you have
   uttered this word, Behold, I will make my words in thy mouth fire, And
   this people wood, And it shall devour them:

   15 Behold I will bring on you a nation from far, O house of Israel,
   saith Jehovah, A strong nation, an ancient nation, A nation whose
   language thou knowest not, And understandest not what it says: (1:286)

   16 Their quiver is like an open sepulcher, All of them are valiant;

   17 And they will devour thy harvest and thy bread; They will devour thy
   sons and thy daughters, They will devour thy flocks and thy herds, They
   will devour thy vine and thy fig-tree; To want shall they reduce thy
   fortified cities, To which thou trustest, by the sword:

   18 But even in those days, saith Jehovah, I will not make with you an
   end.

   19 And it shall be, when ye say, "Why hath Jehovah our God done to us
   All these things?" that thou wilt say to them, -- As ye have forsaken
   me, And served foreign gods in your land, So shall ye serve foreigners
   in a land not your own.

   20 Declare this in the house of Jacob, And publish it in Judah, saying,
   --

   21 Hear this, I pray, Ye foolish people and void of heart, Who have
   eyes and see not, Who have ears and hear not:

   22 Will ye not fear me? saith Jehovah; Will ye not at my presence
   tremble? Who have set the sand a bound to the sea, By a perpetual
   decree that it cannot pass it; Though its waves rage, yet they cannot
   prevail; Though they roar, yet they cannot pass over it.

   23 But this people hath a perverse and rebellious heart; They have
   turned aside and departed:

   24 And they have not said in their heart, -- Let us now fear Jehovah
   our God, Who giveth rain, both the early And the latter shower in its
   season, Who keeps to us the appointed weeks of harvest.

   25 Your iniquities have prevented these things, And your sins have
   restrained good from you.

   26 For found among my people are the wicked; They look, as though they
   would set snares; A trap they set, in which they catch men. (1:303)

   27 As a cage is full of birds So their houses are full of fraud:
   Therefore they are increased and become rich;

   28 They are become fat, they shine; They even surpass the deeds of the
   wicked: The cause they judge not, The cause of the fatherless, yet they
   prosper; And the judgment of the poor they judge not. (1:306)

   29 Shall I not for this visit, saith Jehovah? On such a nation as this
   Shall not my soul be avenged?

   30 A monstrosity and baseness is in the land!

   31 The prophets prophesy falsely, And the priests rule by their means;
   (1:309) And my people wish it to be so: But what will ye do at the end
   of it?
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 6

   1 Be assembled, ye children of Benjamin, From the midst of Jerusalem,
   And in Tekoa sound the trumpet; In Beth-haccerem also set up a sign;
   For evil is seen from the north, And great distress.

   2 To a quiet and delicate woman Have I likened the daughter of Sion:

   3 To her shall come shepherds and their flocks; They shall pitch their
   tents near her around, Feed shall each in his own place.

   4 Prepare ye war against her: "Arise ye, and let us ascend at mid-day;
   Alas for us! for declined has the day, For extended are the evening
   shadows:

   5 Arise, and let us ascend in the night, And let us demolish her
   palaces." (1:319)

   6 For thus saith Jehovah of hosts, -- Cut ye down wood, And form
   against. Jerusalem a mound; It is a city of visitation, Entire
   oppression is in the midst of her:

   7 As a fountain casts out its waters, So she casts out her wickedness;
   Violence and plunder is heard of in her; Before me continually is grief
   and smiting.

   8 Be thou instructed, O Jerusalem, Lest my soul be torn from thee, Lest
   I make thee a desert, A land not inhabited.

   9 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, -- By gleaning they shall glean, as a
   vine, The remnant of Israel: Turn back thine hand, As a grape-gatherer
   into the baskets. (1:326)

   10 To whom shall I speak and protest, That they may hear? Behold,
   uncircumcised is their ear, And they cannot hear; Behold, the word of
   Jehovah is to them a reproach; They delight not in it.

   11 Of Jehovah's indignation therefore am I full, I am wearied with
   refraining To pour it on the children in the streets, And on the
   assembly of young men also; For the husband with his wife shall be
   taken, The aged with the full of days:

   12 And turned shall be their houses to aliens, Their fields and their
   wives in like manner; For I will stretch out my hand On the inhabitants
   of the land, saith Jehovah:

   13 For from the least to the greatest of them, Every one is given to
   covetousness; And from the prophet to the priest, Every one acts
   deceitfully;

   14 And healed have they the wound Of the daughter of my people slightly
   By saying, "Peace, peace," when there was no peace. (1:336)

   15 Were they ashamed, that they had done abomination? Even of shame
   they were not ashamed, And how to blush they knew not: Fall therefore
   shall they among the fallen; At the time of their visitation They shall
   perish, saith Jehovah. (1:339)

   16 Thus said Jehovah, -- Stand in the ways and see, Inquire also
   concerning the old paths, Which is the right way, and walk ye in it,
   That ye may find rest to your soul: And they said, "We will not walk in
   it."

   17 I also set over them watchmen, That they might, attend to the sound
   of the trumpet; But they said, "We will not attend."

   18 Hear therefore, ye nations, And know, thou assembly, what shall be
   to them:

   19 Hear, thou land; behold I bring an evil On this people, the fruit of
   their thoughts; Because to my words they have not hearkened, And my law
   have they despised.

   20 To what purpose is this to me? Incense cometh from Sheba, And the
   sweet came from a far country; Your burnt-offerings are not acceptable,
   And your sacrifices are not pleasant to me.

   21 Therefore thus saith Jehovah, -- Behold, I lay before this people
   stumblingblocks; And stumble shall fathers and sons alike; Neighbor and
   friend, they shall perish.

   22 Thus saith Jehovah, -- Behold, a people shall corns from the north
   country, And a great nation shall be roused From the sides of the
   earth:

   23 On the bow and spear shall they lay hold; They are cruel and will
   not spare; Their voice, like the sea, will roar, And on horses shall
   they mount; Arrayed shall they be as men for war, Against thee, O
   daughter of Sion.

   24 We have heard its fame; Relaxed are our hands, Anguish has laid hold
   on us, The pain as of one in travail.

   25 Go not forth into the field, Nor walk by the way; For the sword of
   the enemy Is a terror on every side.

   26 Daughter of my people! gird on sackcloth, And roll thyself in the
   dust; Make thee mourning, as for an only son, Most bitter lamentation;
   For suddenly shall come on thee the spoiler.

   27 A tower have I made thee to my people, -- A fortress; that thou
   mightest know And try their ways:

   28 All are entire apostates, Walking in detraction; Brass and iron are
   they; All of them are corrupters. (1:358)

   29 Burnt are the bellows by the fire, Entire is the lead, In vain has
   melted the melter; For the wicked have not been refined:

   30 Reprobate silver shall they call them, Because rejected them has
   Jehovah (1:360)
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 7

   1 The word which came to Jeremiah from Jehovah, saying, --

   2 Stand in the gate of the house of Jehovah, And proclaim there this
   word, and say, -- Hear the word of Jehovah, all ye Judah, Who enter
   through these gates to worship Jehovah:

   3 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, -- Make good your
   ways and your doings, And I will dwell with you in this place:

   4 Trust not in words of falsehood, by saying, "The temple of Jehovah,
   the temple of Jehovah, The temple of Jehovah, are these buildings."
   (1:364)

   5 Surely, if by making good ye make good Your ways and your doings, If
   by doing ye do judgment Between man and his neighbor,

   6 If the stranger, the orphan and the widow, Ye oppress not, and
   innocent blood Ye shed not in this place, And after strange gods Ye
   walk not to your hurt, --

   7 Then will I cause you to dwell in this places In the land which I
   gave to your fathers, For ever and ever.

   8 Behold, ye trust in words of falsehood, Which are without profit.

   9 Will ye steal, kill, and commit adultery, Swear falsely, burn incense
   to Baal, And walk after alien gods, Whom ye do not know;

   10 And come and stand before me in this house, Which is called by my
   name, and say, "We have been made free To do all these abominations?"
   (1:373)

   11 Is this house, called by my name, Become a den of robbers in your
   eyes? Even I, behold I see, saith Jehovah.

   12 But go now to my place in Shilo, Where I made to dwell my name at
   first, And see what I did there, For the wickedness of my people
   Israel:

   13 And now, because ye have done All these works, saith Jehovah, And I
   spoke to you, rising early, And when I spoke, ye heard not, When I
   called you, ye answered not;

   14 I will therefore do to this place, Which is called by my name, In
   which ye trust -- Even to the place which I gave to you And to your
   fathers, as I did to Shilo;

   15 And I will cast you out from my presence, As I have cast out all
   your brethren, The whole seed of Ephraim.

   16 And thou, pray not for this people, And raise not for them a cry and
   a prayer, And intercede not with me; For I will not hear thee. (1:384)

   17 Seest thou not what they do in the cities of Judah And in the
   streets of Jerusalem?

   18 Children gather wood, And fathers kindle a fire, And women knead a
   dough, To make cakes for the queen of heaven; And they pour libations
   to alien gods, That they may provoke me to wrath! (1:387)

   19 Do they provoke me to wrath, saith Jehovah? Is it not to the shame
   of their own faces?

   20 Therefore thus saith the Lord Jehovah, -- Behold my wrath, even my
   fury, It shall be poured on this place, Upon men and upon beast, Upon
   the tree of the field and the fruit of the land; And it shall burn, and
   none shall quench it.

   21 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, the God of Israel, -- Your
   burnt-offerings add to your sacrifices, And eat ye the flesh:

   22 For I spoke not to your fathers, Nor commanded them in the day, In
   which I brought them out of the land of Egypt, Concerning
   burnt-offerings and sacrifices;

   23 But this is what I commanded them, saying, -- "Hear my voice, And I
   will be to you a God, And you shall be to me a people; And walk ye in
   all the ways Which I have commanded you. That it may be well with you:

   24 Yet they heard not, nor inclined their car; But walked in perverse
   counsels, In the wickedness of their own evil heart, And went backward
   and not forward.

   25 From the day in which your fathers came out From the land of Egypt,
   to this day, Have I sent to you all my servants, the prophets, Every
   day rising early and sending them:

   26 Yet they heard not nor inclined their ear, But hardened their neck;
   They have acted more perversely than their fathers.

   27 Thou also shalt say to them all these words, But they will not hear
   thee; And thou shalt call to them, But they will not answer thee:

   28 Therefore say to them, -- This is a nation, Which have not hearkened
   to the voice Of Jehovah, their God, And have not received correction:
   Perished has the truth, And cut off has it been from their mouth.

   29 Shave off thy hair and cast it away, Raise on the heights a
   lamentation; Nor rejected thee has Jehovah; And forsaken hath he the
   generation of his wrath:

   30 For the children of Judah have done evil Before mine eyes, saith
   Jehovah; They have set their abominations in the house, On which my
   name is called, to pollute it;

   31 And they have built the high places of Tophet, Which is in the
   valley of the son of Hinnom, To burn their sons and their daughters in
   the fire; Which I have not commanded, Nor has it ever come into my
   heart.

   32 Therefore, behold the days come, saith Jehovah, That it shall no
   more be called Tophet, And The valley of the son of Hinnom, But, The
   valley of slaughter; And they shall bury in Tophet, For elsewhere there
   will be no place:

   33 And the carcasses of this people shall be for meat To the birds of
   heaven and to the beasts of the earth; And there will be none to
   frighten them:

   34 And to cease will I make, from the cities of Judah And from the
   streets of Jerusalem, The voice of joy and the voice of gladness, The
   voice of the bridegroom and the voice of the bride; For to a waste
   shall the land be reduced.
     __________________________________________________________________

   CHAPTER 8

   1 In that day, saith Jehovah, they shall bring forth The bones of the
   kings of Judah, And the bones of his princes, And the bones of the
   priests, And the bones of the prophets, And the bones of the citizens
   of Jerusalem, Out of their graves;

   2 And they shall spread them before the sun, And the moon, and all the
   host of heaven, Which they have loved and served, And after which they
   have walked, And which they have sought, And before which they have
   bowed themselves; They shall not be gathered nor buried; For dung on
   the face of the land shall they be:

   3 And chosen shall be death, Rather than life, by all the residue, Who
   shall remain of this wicked nation, Who shall remain in all the places
   Where I shall drive them, saith Jehovah of hosts.

   4 Thou shalt also say to them, Thus saith Jehovah, -- Shall not they
   who have fallen rise again? If any one turns aside shall he not return?

   5 Why rebel does this people at Jerusalem With a perpetual rebellion?
   They have held fast deceit, They have refused to return.

   6 I hearkened and heard; they will not speak aright; There is no one
   who repents of his wickedness, And says, "What have I done?" Every one
   turns to his own course, Like a horse who rushes into battle. (1:425)

   7 Even the stork in the heavens knows its times; The turtle also, and
   the swallow and the crane, Observe the time of their journey; But my
   people know not the judgment of Jehovah.

   8 How say ye, "We are wise And the law of Jehovah is with us:" Surely,
   behold in vain Hath the writer prepared his pen, In vain are the
   scribes!

   9 Ashamed are the wise, terrified and taken; Behold the word of Jehovah
   have they rejected; And wisdom, what is it to them! (1:432)

   10 I will therefore give their wives to aliens, And their fields to
   inheritors; For from the least even to the greatest, Every one is given
   to covetousness; From the prophet even to the priest, All have acted
   deceitfully;

   11 And healed have they the wound Of the daughter of my people
   slightly, By saying, "Peace, peace," when there was no peace.

   12 Had they shame, that they had done abomination? Even of shame they
   were not ashamed, And how to blush they knew not: Fall therefore shall
   they with the fallen; At the time of their visitation They shall
   perish, saith Jehovah.

   13 Destroying, I will destroy them, saith Jehovah; No grapes shall be
   on the vine, And no figs on the fig-tree; The leaf also shall fall, And
   what I gave them shall pass from them.

   14 Why do we sit still? Assemble ye, And let us enter into fortified
   cities, And let us rest there: Surely, Jehovah our God hath made us
   silent, And given us waters of gall to drink: Because we have sinned
   against Jehovah. (1:442)

   15 We looked for peace, but there was no good; For time of healing, but
   behold terror.

   16 From Dan is heard the snorting of his horses; At the sound of the
   neighing of his strong ones, Tremble does the whole land; For they will
   come and devour The land and its abundance, The city and its
   inhabitants.

   17 For behold, I will send among you Serpents and basilisks, Which will
   not be charmed; And they shall bite you, saith Jehovah.

   18 I would strengthen myself against grief: But within me my heart is
   weak.

   19 Behold the voice of the crying Of the daughter of my people from a
   far country! "Is not Jehovah in Sion? Is not her king within her?" --
   Why have they provoked me to wrath With their images, with foreign
   vanities?

   20 Past has the harvest, ended is the summer, And we have not been
   saved! (1:452)

   21 For the hurt of the daughter of my people I am hurt, I am become
   black; Astonishment has laid hold on me.

   22 Is there no balm in Gilead? Is there no physician there? For why is
   not restored The healing of the daughter of my people! (1:456)

   CHAPTER 9

   1 Who will make my head waters And mine eye a fountain of tears! Then
   would I bewail, day and night, The slain of the daughter of my people.

   2 Who will set me in the desert, In the lodging of travelers! Then
   would I leave my people And depart from them: For all of them are
   adulterers, An assembly of perfidious men.

   3 And they shoot lies with their tongue as with a bow; But not for
   truth are they strong in the land; For from evil to evil they proceed;
   (1:462) And me they know not, saith Jehovah.

   4 And every one of his friend take ye heed, And in a brother trust ye
   not; For every brother by supplanting will supplant, And every friend
   walks fraudulently:

   5 And a man deceives his neighbor, And the truth he speaks not; They
   have taught their tongues to speak falsehood; With doing evil they
   weary themselves.

   6 Thou dwellest in the midst of deceit; Through deceit they refuse To
   know me, saith Jehovah. (1:469)

   7 Therefore thus saith Jehovah of hosts, -- Behold, I will try them,
   and will prove them; For how should I deal With the daughter of my
   people?

   8 A sharpened arrow is their tongue, Falsehood it speaks; His mouth
   speaks peace to his neighbor, But within he sets up intrigues.

   9 For this shall I not visit, saith Jehovah, On such a nation as this
   Shall not my soul be avenged?

   10 For the mountains will I raise up weeping and wailing, For the
   pastures of the wilderness, lamentation; Because they are laid waste,
   So that there is not a man passing through, And they hear not the voice
   of cattle; From the bird of heaven to the beast. Have they fled, have
   they departed. (1:475)

   11 I will also make Jerusalem heaps, A place for dragons; And the
   cities of Judah will I make a waste, So that there shall be no
   inhabitant.

   12 Who is a wise man to understand this? And to whom has Jehovah's
   mouth spoken, That he may declare why the land is to perish -- Is to be
   laid waste like the desert, So that no man should pass through? (1:480)

   13 Then Jehovah said, -- Because they have forsaken my law, Which I
   have set before them, And hearkened not to my voice, Nor walked
   according to it;

   14 But walked after the imaginations Of their own hearts, and after
   Baalim, As their fathers taught them;

   15 Therefore, thus saith Jehovah of hosts, The God of Israel, --
   Behold, I will feed this people with bitterness, And will give them the
   water of gall to drink;

   16 I will also scatter them among the nations, Whom they have not known
   nor their fathers, And I will send after them the sword, Until I shall
   have consumed them.

   17 Thus saith Jehovah of hosts, -- Attend ye and call for the mourning
   women, That they may come, And send for those who are skillful, That
   they may come.

   18 And let them hasten and make a wailing for us, That our eyes may let
   fall tears, And our eyelids drop down waters. (1:489)

   19 For a voice of wailing is heard from Sion, "How we are wasted! How
   greatly shamed! Because we have left the land, They have cast down our
   dwellings."

   20 Therefore hear, ye women, the word of Jehovah, And let your ears
   receive the word of his mouth, And teach your daughters wailing, And
   each one her friend lamentation:

   21 For come up is death to our windows, It has entered into our
   palaces, To cut off the infirm from the street, The young men in the
   broad places. (1:493)

   22 Speak, thus saith Jehovah, fall shall the carcasses of men As dung
   on the face of the field, And as the handful after the reaper, And none
   gathering it.

   23 Thus saith Jehovah, -- Let not the wise glory in his wisdom, And let
   not the brave glory in his courage, Let not the rich glory in his
   riches;

   24 But in this let him glory who glorieth, In understanding, and in
   knowing me, That I am Jehovah, who doeth mercy, Judgment and
   righteousness in the land; For in these things I delight, saith
   Jehovah. (1:502)

   25 Behold the days are coming, saith Jehovah, That I will visit every
   one circumcised, Who is in uncircumcision, --

   26 Egypt and Judah and Edom, The sons of Ammon and Moab, And all those
   who are in extreme recesses, Who dwell in the wilderness; For all these
   nations are uncircumcised, And the whole house of Israel, They are
   uncircumcised in heart.
