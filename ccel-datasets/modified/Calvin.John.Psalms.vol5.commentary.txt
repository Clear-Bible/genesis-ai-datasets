   VOLUME FIFTH

   TRANSLATOR'S PREFACE.

   In bringing to a close his labors on Calvin's Commentary On The Psalms,
   the Editor begs leave to state, that in addition to the General Index,
   and the Indices Of Texts Of Scripture, and of Hebrew Words, originally
   contemplated, it has been deemed highly desirable to give at the end of
   the Commentary a Translation; or Calvin's Version Of The Psalms
   arranged in parallelisms, together with a Table Of Those Passages In
   The Psalms Which Are Quoted In The New Testament, and a Table Of The
   Particular Subjects Of Each Psalm, according to Calvin's
   interpretation. These additions, it is hoped, will be considered as
   improvements. From the extent to which they have increased the size of
   this Volume, it has been found necessary to omit the Appendix of
   Additional Criticisms to which reference is made in some of the
   footnotes throughout the work.

   To exhibit the Psalms arranged in the metrical order, was an idea which
   appears never to have suggested itself to the mind of Calvin. In his
   time, indeed, and long after it, the peculiar character of Hebrew
   Poetry was not understood. It was not till a recent period that any
   steady light was thrown on the laws of its composition. A vast amount
   of learning had indeed been expended on the subject, and a variety of
   hypotheses had been suggested by successive writers to unravel a
   question so intricate and mysterious; but no satisfactory result was
   attained until it was investigated by the learned Bishop Lowth, to
   whose genius and erudition we are indebted for the discovery of this
   long lost secret. He has proved, with a clearness and force of evidence
   which has now commanded universal assent, that Hebrew Poetry bears no
   resemblance in its structure to the Poetry of Greece and Rome, that it
   has no rhyming termination of lines as in the Poetry of our own
   language, and that its peculiar, and perhaps its sole characteristic,
   lies in a felicitous arrangement of words into what he denominates
   Parallelism. In other words, its leading peculiarity is that each
   sentence consists generally of two parts, closely corresponding to each
   other, not indeed in the number of syllables, but in the ideas which
   they express, or in their grammatical constructive form, the second
   being synonymous (or, as Bishop Jebb would denominate it, cognate) with
   the first, -- or antipathetic to it in its terms and sentiments, -- or
   similar to it in the form of grammatical construction, such as noun
   answering to noun, verb to verb, member to member, negative to
   negative, interrogative to interrogative. [1] The division of these
   sacred poems into hemistichs or lines is, therefore, the form in which
   they ought naturally to be arranged; and such an arrangement is
   attended with great advantages. It exhibits to the eye the peculiar
   structure of Hebrew poetical composition, and is, besides, an important
   aid in Scriptural Interpretation, as it often contributes to the
   elucidation of obscure and difficult passages, and enables even the
   mere English reader to discover a thousand beauties, which, without
   such a help, would escape his notice.

   In translating this parallel version, two of Calvin's translations of
   the Hebrew text were at the service of the Editor, -- the Latin and the
   French. The former is strictly literal, rarely changing the Hebrew
   idiom, or even inserting a supplementary term, and uniformly giving the
   arrangement of the words as they stand in the inspired original. The
   latter is also upon the whole literal, though in some instances it
   changes the Hebrew idiom into the French, as well as frequently inserts
   such supplementary terms as the sense seems to require; and
   disregarding the arrangement of the words in the original, it gives
   them in the order most suitable to the genius of the French tongue. The
   Editor has followed Calvin's Latin Version, and has rendered it
   literally, retaining the Hebrew modes of expression, and the
   arrangement of the words in the sequence of the Hebrew text, except in
   a very few instances where a deviation seemed necessary to render the
   reading intelligible. Occasionally he has found it necessary to insert
   some supplementary words. These, when taken from Calvin's French
   Version, as is generally the case, are printed simply in italics, and
   when supplied by the Editor are printed in italics and enclosed within
   brackets. By adhering to the Hebrew order of the words, the
   arrangements may sometimes appear harsh and uncouth; but very often
   they give much beauty and force to the expression. And in retaining the
   Hebrew idioms, the Editor has felt little scruple, considering that as
   our English Bible is a literal verbal translation of the Original
   Hebrew, many of these are quite familiar to us, and from their peculiar
   grace have even become naturalized in our language.

   "The Hebrew idioms," says Addison, "run into the English with a
   peculiar grace and beauty. Our language has received innumerable
   elegencies's and improvements from that infusion of Hebraisms which are
   derived to it out of the poetical passages in Holy Writ. They give a
   force and energy to our expressions, warm and animate our language, and
   convey our thoughts in more ardent and intense phrases than any that
   are to be met with in our own tongue. There is something so pathetic in
   this kind of diction, that it often sets the mind in a flame, and makes
   our heart burn within us."

   The utility of the two Tables adverted to is too obvious to require to
   be dwelt upon. From the former the reader will perceive how completely
   the inspiration of the Psalms is established by New Testament
   authority, and how highly they were appreciated by Christ and His
   Apostles, there being no portion of Old Testament Scripture from which
   they so frequently quoted. The other Table will readily serve as a
   guide to the selection of such Psalms as may be adapted to the
   doctrines of the Christian system, the duties of the Christian life, or
   the varied circumstances, whether prosperous or adverse, in which the
   Christian or the Church of God may be placed.

   [1] This sentence expresses the three specific heads into which Lowth
   discovered Hebrew parallelism, -- which involves in it much variety and
   many gradations, -- may be generally And more loosely distributed,
   Parallels Synonymous, (or, according to JEBB, Parallels Cognate,)
   Parallels Antithetic, and Parallels Synthetic or Constructive. For an
   example of the first, see Psalm 1:1-5; of the second, see Psalm 20:7,
   8; and of the third, see Psalm 148:7-13.

   Psalm 119:121-128

   121. I have done judgment and righteousness: give me not up to my
   oppressors. 122. Become surety for thy servant for good, that the proud
   may not oppress me. 123. My eyes have failed for thy salvation, and for
   thy righteous word. [2] 124. Deal with thy servant according to thy
   goodness, and teach me thy statutes. 125. I am thy servant, give me
   understanding, that I may learn thy testimonies. 126. It is time for
   thee, O Jehovah! to be doing for they have destroyed thy law. 127. And
   therefore I have loved thy statutes above gold, [3] yea even above the
   most fine gold [4] 128. Therefore I have esteemed all thy commandments
   to be altogether right, and have hated every way of lying.


   121. I have done judgment and righteousness. The Prophet implores the
   help of God against the wicked who troubled him, and he does so in such
   a manner as at the same time to testify that the harassing treatment he
   received from them was on his part altogether undeserved. If we would
   have God to come down to succor us, it becomes us to see to it that we
   meet him with the testimony of a good conscience. As He everywhere
   promises his aid to the afflicted who are unrighteously oppressed, it
   is no superfluous protestation which the Prophet makes, that he had not
   provoked his enemies, but had restrained himself from all injury and
   wrong-doing, and had not even attempted to requite evil for evil. In
   asserting that he had at all times done judgment, he means that
   whatever rite wicked practiced, he steadfastly persevered in following
   after integrity, and never turned aside from what was just and right in
   any of his public or private transactions.

   122. Become surety for thy servant for good. This prayer is almost
   similar to that of the preceding verse; for I prefer translating the
   Hebrew verb rvv, arob, by Become surety for, to rendering, as others
   do, Delight thy servant in good, or Make thy servant to delight in good
   According to this second version, the words are a prayer that God would
   rejoice his servant with his benefits. There is a third translation, by
   which they become a prayer that God would inspire his heart with the
   love and desire of rectitude; for true perfection consists in our
   taking pleasure in justice and uprightness. But as from the last clause
   of the verse it is obvious that David here desires succor against his
   enemies, the verb Become surety is the more appropriate rendering [5]
   Lord, as if he had said, since the proud cruelly rush upon me to
   destroy me, interpose thyself between us, as if thou wert my surety.
   The letter l, lamed, which signifies for, is not indeed prefixed to the
   noun, but this is no valid objection to our translation, as that letter
   is often understood. It is a form of expression full of comfort, to
   represent God as performing the office of a surety in order to effect
   our deliverance. He is said metaphorically to become surety for us,
   just as if, on finding us indebted in a large sum of money, he
   discharged us of the obligation, by paying down the money to our
   creditor. The prayer is to this effect, That God would not suffer the
   wicked to exercise their cruelty against us at their pleasure, but that
   he would interpose as a defender to save us. By these words the Prophet
   intimates, that he was in extreme danger, and that he had nothing else
   left him in which to hope but the help of God.

   123. My eyes have failed for thy salvation. [6] In the first place he
   testifies, that he had been afflicted with severe troubles, and that
   not for a short time only, but for a period so protracted as might have
   exhausted his patience and occasioned despondency. But so far was this
   from being the effect they produced, that he declares that in all these
   long and wearisome conflicts his heart had never sunk into despair. We
   have before explained failing for salvation as denoting that although
   there was no prospect of an end to his calamities, and although despair
   presented itself on every side, yet he strove against temptation even
   to the fainting of his soul. Should we understand the past tense of the
   verb as put for the present, in which sense it seems to be employed,
   the Prophet in that case intimates, that his eyes fail him not because
   they become fatigued, but because through earnest looking they contract
   as it were a dimness, and that yet he does not cease to wait
   continually for the salvation of God. In short, the failing of his eyes
   indicates perseverance combined with severe and arduous effort, and it
   is opposed to the momentary ardor of those who immediately faint, if
   God does not grant their requests. This expression also denotes a
   painful earnestness, which almost consumes all the senses. As to the
   term salvation, he does not limit it to one kind of help, but
   comprehends under it the continual course of God's grace, until he put
   his believing people in the possession of complete salvation. He
   expresses the manner in which he waited for salvation, which was by
   depending upon God's word in which two things are to be attended to,
   first, that we can only be said to wait for salvation from God, when,
   confiding in his promises, we actually betake ourselves to him for
   protection; and secondly, that we then only yield to God the praise of
   salvation, when we continue to keep our hope firmly fixed on his word.
   This is the way in which He is to be sought; and although he may
   conceal from our view the working of his hand, we ought to repose in
   his bare promises. This is the reason why David calls God's word
   righteous. He would hereby confirm his faith in the truth of the divine
   promises for God in promising liberally does not cherish in his people
   delusive expectations.

   124. Deal with thy servant according to thy goodness. The two clauses
   of this verse must be read correctly; for he does not first separately
   desire God to deal well with him, and next desire him to be his master
   and teacher. He rather beseeches him in the exercise of that goodness
   and mercy, which he is wont to display towards all his people, to
   instruct him in his law. The object of the Prophet's request then is,
   that God would teach him in his statutes. But he begins with the divine
   mercy, employing it as an argument to prevail with God to grant him
   what he desires. This prayer then must be resolved thus: Lord, deal
   gently with me, and manifest thy goodness towards me by instructing me
   in thy commandments. Our whole happiness undoubtedly consists in our
   having that true wisdom which is to be derived from the word of God;
   and our only hope of obtaining this wisdom lies in God's being pleased
   to display his mercy and goodness towards us. The Prophet, therefore,
   magnifies the greatness and excellence of the benefit of being
   instructed in the divine law, when he requests that it may be bestowed
   upon him as a free gift.

   125. I am thy servant, give me understanding. Here the prayer of the
   preceding verse is repeated. The repetition shows how ardently he
   wished the blessing prayed for, and how earnest and importunate he was
   in pleading with God for it. By the words he expresses still more
   plainly in what way it is that God teaches his own people -- that he
   does so by illuminating with sound knowledge their understandings,
   which otherwise would be blind. It would profit us little to have the
   divine law sounding in our ears, or to have it exhibited in writing
   before our eyes, and to have it expounded by the voice of man, did not
   God correct our slowness of apprehension, and render us docile by the
   secret influence of his Spirit. We are not to suppose that David
   advances any meritorious claims before God when he boasts of being his
   servant. Men, indeed, commonly imagine that when we are previously well
   prepared, God then adds new grace, which they term subsequent grace.
   But the Prophet, so far from boasting of his own worth, rather declares
   how deep the obligations were under which he lay to God. It is not in
   the power of any man to make himself a servant of the Most High, nor
   can any man bring anything of his own as a price with which to purchase
   so great an honor. Of this the Prophet was well aware. He knew that
   there is not one of the whole human family who is worthy of being
   enrolled among that order; and therefore he does nothing more than
   adduce the grace he had obtained, as an argument that God according to
   his usual way would perfect what he had begun. In a similar manner he
   speaks in Psalm 116:6,

   "I am thy servant and the son of thine handmaid:"

   in which place it is abundantly manifest that he does not boast of his
   services, but only declares that he is one of the members of the
   Church.

   126. It is time for thee, O Jehovah! to be doing. It being the object
   of the Prophet to imprecate upon the impious and wicked the vengeance
   which they have deserved, he says, that the fit time for executing it
   had now arrived, inasmuch as they had carried to a great extent their
   wanton forwardness against God. The general verb doing is more emphatic
   than if one more specific had been used. The language is as if he had
   said, that God would seem to delay too long, if he did not now execute
   the office of a judge. It is the peculiar work of God to restrain the
   wicked, and even to punish them severely when he finds that their
   repentance is utterly hopeless. If it is alleged, that this prayer is
   inconsistent with the law of charity, it may be replied, that David
   here speaks of reprobates, whose amendment is become desperate. His
   heart, there is no doubt, was governed by the spirit of wisdom.
   Besides, it is to be remembered, that he does not complain of his own
   private wrongs. It is a pure and honest zeal which moves him to desire
   the destruction of the wicked despisers of God; for he adduces no other
   reason for the prayer, than that the wicked destroyed God's law. By
   this he gives evidence, that nothing was dearer to him than the service
   of God, and that nothing was held by him in higher recommendation than
   the observance of the law. I have already repeatedly warned you, in
   other places, that our zeal is forward and disordered whenever its
   moving principle is a sense of our own personal injuries. It is,
   therefore, to be carefully noticed, that the Prophet's grief proceeded
   from no other cause than that he could not endure to see the divine law
   violated. In short, this is a prayer that God would restore to order
   the confused and ruinous state of things in the world. It remains for
   us to learn from David's example, whenever the earth is fraught and
   defiled with wickedness to such a degree that the fear of him has
   become almost extinct, to call upon him to show himself the maintainer
   of his own glory. This doctrine is of use in sustaining our hope and
   patience whenever God suspends the execution of his judgments longer
   than we would incline. Previous to his addressing himself to God, the
   Prophet adopts it as a principle, that, although God may seem for a
   time to take no notice of what his creatures do, yet he never forgets
   his office, but delays the execution of his judgments for wise reasons,
   that at length he may execute them when the seasonable time arrives.

   127. And therefore I have loved thy statutes above gold. This verse, I
   have no doubt, is connected with the preceding; for otherwise the
   illative particle therefore would be without meaning. Viewing it in
   this connection, I understand the Psalmist as intimating, that the
   reason why he esteemed God's law as more valuable than gold and
   precious stones, was because he had fixed in his mind a thorough
   persuasion of the truth, that although God may connive for a time at
   wickedness, the making havoc of all uprightness and equity will not
   always remain unpunished. Yea, the more he saw the wicked outrageously
   breaking forth into wickedness, the more was he incited by a holy
   indignation burning in his heart, to love the law. This is a passage
   deserving of special attention, for the baneful influence of evil
   example is well known, every man thinking that he may lawfully do
   whatever is commonly practiced around him. Whence it comes to pass,
   that evil company carries us away like a tempest. The more diligently
   then ought we to meditate on this doctrine, That when the wicked claim
   to themselves an unbridled liberty, it behoves us to contemplate with
   the eyes of faith the judgments of God, in order to our being thereby
   quickened to the observance of the divine law. If attention to this
   doctrine has been needful from the beginning, at the present day it is
   necessary to exert ourselves, that we may not be involved in violating
   the law of God with the wicked conspiracy which almost the whole world
   have formed to violate it. The more outrageously the wicked vaunt
   themselves, let our veneration for and our love of the divine law
   proportionally increase.

   128. Therefore I have esteemed all thy commandments to be altogether
   right [7] This verse, like the preceding, is connected with the 26th,
   and the connection may be brought out by observing, that the Prophet,
   waiting patiently for God's judgments, and also earnestly calling for
   their infliction, had subscribed to the law of God in every particular,
   and embraced it without a single exception -- and moreover, that he
   hated every false way. Literally, it is all the commandments of all;
   but the words of all are to be referred to things and not to persons,
   as if he had said, that he approved of all the laws which God had
   ordained, whatever they enjoined. [8] A similar form of expression
   occurs in Ezekiel 44:30, "all oblations of all things" -- that is to
   say, whatever kind of oblations men offer. The Prophet has not laid
   down this sentiment in such express terms without good reason; for
   there is nothing to which we are naturally more inclined than to
   despise or reject whatever in God's law is not agreeable to us. Every
   man, according as he is tainted with this or that particular vice,
   would desire their the commandment which forbids it were razed out of
   the law. But we cannot lawfully make any addition to it, or take away
   anything from it; and since God has joined his commandments together by
   a sacred and inviolable bond, to separate any one of them from the rest
   is altogether unwarrantable. We perceive then how the Prophet, inspired
   with a holy jealousy for the law, contended against the wicked
   rebellion of those who despised it. And assuredly, when we see that the
   ungodly mock God with such effrontery, at one time rising up
   audaciously against him, trod at another perverting every part of the
   law, it becomes us to be the more inflamed with zeal, and to be the
   more courageous in maintaining the truth of God. The extreme impiety of
   our age especially demands of all the faithful that they should
   exercise themselves in this holy zeal. Profane men strive to outdo one
   another in scornfully aspersing the doctrine of salvation, and endeavor
   to bring God's sacred Word into contempt by their derisive jeers.
   Others pour forth their blasphemies without intermission. We cannot,
   therefore, avoid being chargeable with the crime of treacherous
   indifference, if our hearts are not warmed with zeal, and unless we
   burn with a holy jealousy. The Prophet not merely says, that he
   approved of God's law wholly and without exception, but he adds, that
   he hated every way of lying, or every false way. And, undoubtedly, no
   one subscribes in good earnest to the law of God, but he who rejects
   all the slanders by which the wicked taint or obscure the purity of
   sound doctrine. By way of lying, the Prophet doubtless means whatever
   is opposed to the purity of the law, intimating that he detested all
   corruption's which are contrary to the Word of God.

   [2] Literally, "for the word of thy righteousness." Calvin understands
   it of the divine promises. Phillips translates "for the word of thy
   justice," "that is," says he, "for the sentence of justice on my
   oppressors, as the first part of the verse teaches; for the passing
   this sentence will be equivalent to the granting the salvation which
   the Psalmist so ardently desired."

   [3] "Above gold. mzhv, mizahab, more than resplendent gold; gold
   without any stain or rust." -- Dr. Adam Clarke

   [4] "Ou, marguerites." -- Fr. marg. "Or, pearls." "vmphz, umipaz, above
   solid gold; gold separated from the dross, perfectly refined." -- Dr.
   Adam Clarke.

   [5] rv This verb signifies to be pleasant, acceptable. So Bucer has
   translated the first part of the verse, oblecta servum tuum bono; and
   indeed the Chaldee has given the same sense to the verb, for it is
   rendered by vsym, make merry. But the other meaning which it has, viz.
   to become surety, is evidently more suitable; for the expression Be
   surety for thy servant for good, corresponds very well with the
   previous and subsequent petitions, which are for deliverance from the
   hands of the enemy." -- Phillips.

   [6] "In times of great sorrow, when the heart is oppressed with care,
   and when danger threatens on every side, the human eye expresses with
   amazing accuracy the distressing and anguished emotions of the soul.
   The posture here described is that of an individual who perceives
   himself surrounded with enemies of the most formidable character, who
   feels his own weakness and insufficiency to enter into conflict with
   them, but who is eagerly looking for the arrival of a devoted and
   powerful friend, who has promised to succor him in the hour of his
   calamity." -- Dr. Morison.

   [7] Durell translates this verse -- "For, as much as I esteem all thy
   precepts, etc., therefore I hate," etc.

   [8] "All the precepts of everything, i.e., all precepts concerning all
   things. I embrace thy revealed Word, without any exceptions. The
   Psalmist states, that he had most diligently applied his mind to the
   consideration of all God's commandments, the circumstances and
   occasions on which they were given, and he observed that they abounded
   in justice and holiness. Since, therefore, they are all equally just
   and holy, whatsoever is contrary to them he regarded as unjust, impure,
   false and detestable. Hammond remarks, that the reduplication of the
   universal particle kl is emphatic all, even all;' and so the plain
   rendering is most current, all thy commandments, even all, have I
   approved." -- Phillips.

   Psalm 119:129-136

   129. ph Thy testimonies are marvelous; therefore my soul hath kept
   them. 130. ph The entrance of thy words is light, which giveth
   understanding to the little ones. 131. ph I opened my mouth and panted,
   because I loved thy commandments. 132. ph Look upon me, and be merciful
   to me, according to thy judgment towards them that love thy name. 133.
   ph Direct my steps according to thy word, and let no iniquity have [9]
   dominion in me. 134. ph Deliver me from the oppression of men; and I
   will keep thy precepts. 135. ph Make thy face to shine upon thy
   servant; and teach me thy statutes. 136. ph Rivers of waters run from
   my eyes, because they have not kept thy law.


   129. Thy testimonies are marvelous. I have given this translation to
   avoid an ambiguous form of expression. The Prophet does not simply
   mean, that the doctrine of the law is wonderful, but that it contains
   high and hidden mysteries. Accordingly he declares, that the sublime
   and admirable wisdom which he found comprehended in the divine law led
   him to regard it with reverence. This is to be carefully marked, for
   the law of God is proudly despised by the great majority of mankind,
   when they do not duly taste its doctrine, nor acknowledge that God
   speaks from his throne in heaven, that, the pride of the flesh being
   abased, he may raise us upward by the apprehension of faith. We also
   gather from this passage, that it is impossible for any man to keep the
   law of God from the heart, unless he contemplate it with feelings of
   reverence: for reverence is the beginning of pure and right subjection.
   Accordingly, I have said that many despise God's Word, because they
   think it inferior to the acuteness of their own understandings. Yea,
   many are led to break forth more audaciously into this heaven-daring
   contempt, from the vanity of showing their own ingenuity. But, although
   worldly men may flatter themselves in that proud disdain of the divine
   law, yet the commendation which the Prophet pronounces upon it still
   holds true, that it comprehends mysteries which far transcend all the
   conceptions of the human mind.

   130. The entrance of thy word is light. The amount is, that the light
   of the truth revealed in God's word, is so distinct that the very first
   sight of it illuminates the mind. The word phtch pethach, properly
   signifies an opening, [10] but metaphorically it is taken for a gate.
   Accordingly the old translator has rendered it beginning, which is not
   improper, provided it is understood of the rudiments or first elements
   of the divine law. It is as if the Prophet had -- "Not only do those
   who have attained an accurate acquaintance with the whole law, and who
   have made the study of it the business of their lives, discern there a
   clear light, but also those who have studied it even very imperfectly,
   and who have only, so to speak, entered the porch." Now we must reason
   from the less to the greater. If tyroes and novices begin to be
   enlightened at their first entrance, what will be the case when a man
   is admitted to a full and perfect knowledge?

   In the second clause the Prophet unfolds his meaning more fully. By
   little ones he denotes such as neither excel in ingenuity nor are
   endued with wisdom, but rather are unskilled in letters, and unrefined
   by education. Of such he affirms that, as soon as they have learned the
   first principles of the law of God, they will be endued with
   understanding. It ought to have a most powerful influence in exciting
   in us an earnest desire to become acquainted with the law of God, when
   we are told that even those who, in the estimation of the world, are
   fools, and contemptible simpletons, provided they apply their minds to
   this subject, acquire from it wisdom sufficient to lead them to eternal
   salvation. Although it is not given to all men to attain to the highest
   degree in this wisdom, yet it is common to all the godly to profit so
   far as to know the certain and unerring rule by which to regulate their
   life. Thus no man who surrenders himself to the teaching of God, will
   loose his labor in his school, for from his first entrance he will reap
   inestimable fruit. Meanwhile we are warned, that all who follow their
   own understanding, wander in darkness. By affirming that the little
   ones are enlightened, David intimates, that it is only when men,
   divested of all self confidence, submit themselves with humble and
   docile minds to God, that they are in a proper state for becoming
   proficient scholars in the study of the divine law. Let the Papists
   mock, as they are accustomed to do, because we would have the
   Scriptures to be read by all men without exception; yet it is no
   falsehood which God utters by the mouth of David, when he affirms that
   the light of his truth is exhibited to fools. God will not, therefore,
   disappoint the desire of such as acknowledge their own ignorance, and
   submit themselves humbly to his teaching.

   131. I opened my mouth and panted. [11] By these words the Psalmist
   would have us to understand that he was inflamed with such love to and
   longing for the divine law, that he was unceasingly sighing after it.
   In comparing himself to such as are hungry, or to such as burn with
   parching thirst, he has used a very appropriate metaphor. As such
   persons indicate the vehemence of their desire by opening the mouth,
   and by distressful panting, as if they would suck up the whole air,
   even so the Prophet affirms that he himself was oppressed with
   continual uneasiness. The opening of the mouth, then, and the drawing
   of breath, are set in opposition to a cold assent to the word of God.
   Here the Holy Spirit teaches with what earnestness of soul the
   knowledge of divine truth is to be sought. Whence it follows, that such
   as make little or no proficiency in God's law, are punished by their
   own indolence or carelessness. When David affirms that he panted
   continually, he points out not only his ardor but also his constancy.

   132. Look upon me, and be merciful to me. In this verse he beseeches
   God to have a regard to him: as he is accustomed always to look to
   those who are his people. The Hebrew word mspht mishpat, translated
   judgment, signifies in this passage, as in many others, a common rule,
   or ordinary usage. [12] He next adds the purpose for which he desires
   that God would look upon him, namely, that he may be relieved from his
   miseries. This, then, is the prayer of an afflicted man, who, when
   apparently destitute of all help, and unable to come to any other
   conclusion than that he is neglected and forsaken of God, yet reflects
   with himself, that, for God to forsake him, was foreign to his nature
   and to his usual manner of procedure. It is as if he had said --
   Although I can perceive no token of thy favor, yea, although my
   condition is so wretched and desperate, that, judging according to
   sense and reason, I deem that thou hast turned the back: upon me; yet,
   as from the beginning of the world to the present day, thou hast
   testified, by numberless proofs, that thou art merciful to thy
   servants, I beseech time that, acting according to this rule, thou
   wouldst now exercise the like loving-kindness towards me. It is to be
   particularly noticed, lest those whom God does not immediately answer
   may become discouraged, that the Prophet had been long oppressed by
   miseries, without any prospect of relief. Yet it is at the same time to
   be observed, that the Prophets sole ground of confidence in asking this
   from God is his free goodness. Whence we gather that, although he was a
   man of eminent sanctity, yet the undeserved grace of God was his only
   refuge. With respect to the word judgment, let us learn from the
   Prophet's example to acquaint ourselves with the nature of God, from
   the various experiences we have had of it that we may have certain
   evidence that he is merciful to us. And, in truth, were not his grace
   known to us from the daily experience we have of it, which of us would
   dare to approach him? But if our eyes are not blind, we must perceive
   the very clear testimonies by which he fortifies our faith, so that we
   need not doubt that all the godly are the objects of his regard; only
   we must endeavor to be among the number of those who love his name. By
   this title is meant genuine believers; for those who only slavishly
   fear God are not worthy of being reckoned among his servants. He
   requires a voluntary obedience from us, so that nothing may be more
   delightful to us than to follow whithersoever he calls us. It is,
   however, at the same time to be observed, that this love proceeds from
   faith; yea, the Prophet here commends the grand effect of faith, by
   separating the godly, who lean upon the grace of God, from worldly men,
   who, having given their hearts to the enticements of the world, never
   lift up their minds towards heaven.

   133. Direct my steps according to thy word. By these words he shows, as
   he has often done before in other places, that the only rule of living
   well is for men to regulate themselves wholly by the law of God. We
   have already repeatedly seen in this Psalm, that so long as men allow
   there-selves to wander after their own inventions, God rejects whatever
   they do, however laborious the efforts they may put forth. But as the
   Prophet declares that men's lives are then only framed aright when they
   yield themselves wholly to the obeying of God, so, on the other hand,
   he confesses that to do this is not within their own will or power.
   God's law, it is evident, will not make us better by merely prescribing
   to us what is right. Hence the outward preaching of it is compared to a
   dead letter. David, then, well instructed in the law, prays for an
   obedient heart being given him, that he may walk in the way set before
   him. Here two points are particularly deserving of our notice -- first,
   that God deals bountifully with men, when he invites them to himself by
   his word and doctrine; and, secondly, that still all this is lifeless
   and unprofitable, until he govern by his Spirit those whom he has
   already taught by his word. As the Psalmist desires not simply to have
   his steps directed, but to have them directed to God's word, we may
   learn that he did not hunt after secret revelations, and set the word
   at nought, as many fanatics do, but connected the external doctrine
   with the inward grace of the Holy Spirit; and herein consists the
   completeness of the faithful, in that God engraves on their hearts what
   he shows by his word to be right. Nothing, therefore, is more foolish
   than the fancy of those who say, that in enjoining upon men what he
   would have them to do, God estimates the strength which they have to
   perform it. In vain does divine truth sound in our ears, if the Spirit
   of God does not effectually pierce into our hearts. The Prophet
   confesses that it is to no purpose for him to read or hear the law of
   God, unless his life is regulated by the secret influence of the Holy
   Spirit, that he may thus be enabled to walk in that righteousness which
   the law enjoins. In the second clause he reminds us how necessary it is
   for us to be continually presenting this prayer at the throne of grace,
   acknowledging that he is the bond-slave of sin until God stretch forth
   his hand to deliver him. direct me, says he, that iniquity may not have
   dominion in me. [13] So long, then, as we are left to ourselves, Satan
   exercises', over us his despotic sway uncontrolled, so that we have not
   power to rid ourselves of iniquity. The freedom of the godly consists
   solely in this -- that they are governed by the Spirit of God, and thus
   preserved from succumbing to iniquity, although harassed with hard and
   painful conflicts.

   134. Deliver me from the oppression of men. When recounting what had
   befallen himself, the Prophet shows, by his own example, that all the
   godly are exposed to rapine and oppression, and that, like sheep in the
   mouths of wolves, they will be inevitably destroyed unless God defend
   them. As very few are governed by the Spirit of God, it is no wonder if
   all love of equity is banished from the world, and if all men are found
   everywhere rushing into all kinds of wickedness, some impelled by
   cruelty, [14] and others devoted to fraud and deceit. When, therefore,
   the Prophet saw that he was overwhelmed on all sides with injuries, he
   betook himself to God as his deliverer. By the word deliver he
   intimates, that unless he is preserved in a wonderful manner, it is all
   over with him. In the second clause, he engages that he will not prove
   ungrateful for his deliverance: And I will keep thy precepts Nothing
   more effectually strengthens us, in an earnest desire and endeavor to
   follow after integrity and righteousness, than when we find by
   experience, that God's defense is of more value to us than all the
   unlawful helps to which worldly men unusually have recourse. We are
   taught from this passage, that when engaged in contest with the wicked,
   we ought not to suffer our minds to be actuated by malice, but that,
   however violently and unjustly they may assault us, we should rest;
   contented with the deliverance which God bestows, and with that alone;
   and again, that every instance in which we experience the grace of God
   in delivering us, should be a spur to incite us to follow after
   uprightness. He delivers us for no other end, but that the fruits of
   our deliverance may be manifested in our life; and we are too perverse
   if that experience is not sufficient to convince us, that all who
   persevere in the unfeigned fear of God, will always abide in safety by
   his aid, although the whole world may be against them.

   135. Make thy face to shine upon thy servant. There is here the
   repetition of a prayer which we have several times met with before in
   this Psalm. The Prophet intimates, that he regarded nothing as of more
   importance than rightly to understand the divine law. When he beseeches
   God to make his face to shine upon his servant, he, in the first place,
   seeks to win the fatherly favor of God -- for nothing is to be hoped
   for from Him unless we have an interest in his favor -- but he at the
   same time, shows the greatness of the blessing. There is no testimony
   of the love of God, as if he had said, which I am more desirous to
   obtain than to be enabled to make progress in his law. Whence we
   gather, as I have lately observed, that he preferred divine truth to
   all the possessions of the world. Would to God that this affection were
   vigorous in our hearts! But that which the Prophet extols so highly, is
   neglected by the great proportion of mankind. If individuals are to be
   found stimulated by this desire, we see them presently falling back to
   the Measurements of the world, so that there are very few, indeed, who
   renouncing all other desires, seek earnestly with David to become
   acquainted with the doctrine of the law. Besides, as God vouchsafes
   this privilege only to those whom he has embraced with his fatherly
   love, it is proper for us to begin with this prayer, That he would make
   his face to shine upon us. This form of expression, however, conveys
   something more -- it implies, that it is only when God illumines the
   minds of his believing people with the true knowledge of the law, that
   he delights them with the beams of his favor. It often happens that,
   even in regard to them, God's countenance is overcast with clouds in
   this respect, namely, when he deprives them of tasting the sweetness of
   his word.

   136. Rivers of waters run from my eyes. [15] Here David affirms that he
   was inflamed with no ordinary zeal for the glory of God, inasmuch as he
   dissolved wholly into tears on account of the contempt put upon the
   divine law. He speaks hyperbolically; but still he truly and plainly
   expresses the disposition of mind with which he was endued; and it
   corresponds with what he says in altogether place, "The zeal of thine
   house hath eaten me up." (Psalm 69:9.) Wherever the Spirit of God
   reigns, he excites this ardent zeal, which burns the hearts of the
   godly when they see the commandment of the Most High God accounted as a
   thing of nought. It is not enough that each of us endeavor to please
   God; we must also desire that his law may be held in estimation by all
   men. In this way holy Lot, as the Apostle Peter testifies, vexed his
   soul when he beheld Sodom a sink of all kinds of wickedness. (2 Peter
   2:8.) If, in former times, the ungodliness of the world extorted from
   the children of God such bitter grief, so great is the corruption into
   which we at this day are fallen, that those who can look upon the
   present state of things unconcerned and without tears, are thrice, yea
   four times, insensible. How great in our day is the frenzy of the world
   in despising God and neglecting his doctrine? A few, no doubt, are to
   be found who with the mouth profess their willingness to receive it,
   but scarcely one in ten proves the sincerity of his profession by his
   life. Meanwhile countless multitudes are hurried away to the impostures
   of Satan and to the Pope; others are as thoughtless and indifferent
   about their salvation as the lower animals; [16] and many Epicureans
   openly mock at all religion. If there is, then, the smallest portion of
   piety remaining in us, full rivers of tears, and not merely small
   drops, will flow from our eyes. But if we would give evidence of pure
   and uncorrupted zeal, let our grief begin at ourselves -- at our seeing
   that we are yet far from having attained to a perfect observance of the
   law; yea, that the depraved lusts of our carnal nature are often rising
   up against the righteousness of God.

   Psalm 119:137-144

   137. ts O Jehovah! thou art righteous, and thy judgments are right.
   138. tsThou hast commanded righteousness in thy testimonies, and truth
   greatly. 139. tsMy zeal hath consumed me, because my adversaries have
   forgotten thy words. 140. ts Thy word is exceedingly refined, and thy
   servant hath loved it. 141. tsI am insignificant and despised; I have
   not forgotten thy commandments. 142.ts Thy righteousness is an
   everlasting righteousness; and the law is truth. 143.ts Trouble and
   anguish have come upon me; but thy commandments are my delight. 144.
   tsThe righteousness of thy testimonies endereth for ever; give me
   understanding and I shall live.


   137. O Jehovah! thou art righteous. The Prophet yields to God the
   praise of righteousness, and also acknowledges that it is to be found
   in his law. Some understand judgments as referring to those
   infliction's by which God chastises the sins of men; but this does not
   seem so fitly to agree with the scope of the passage. Besides, as the
   adjective ysr, yashar, translated right, is put in the singular number
   with the word judgments, the sentence should be explained thus that
   there is not any one of the judgments of God which is not right. Should
   we be inclined to take ysr as a substantive, the sense will be almost
   the same. All men indeed grant that God is righteous; but the Prophet
   has expressed more than the common sort of men, yea than the whole
   world, perceive in reference to this subject; for in designating God
   righteous, he means, that as soon as we depart from Him, we will not
   find a particle of righteousness anywhere else. When he adds that the
   evidence and testimony of this righteousness are to be seen in the law,
   he teaches us that God is robbed of his praise, if we do not subscribe
   to all his commandments. To the same purpose is the following verse,
   which declares that God has taught in his law full and perfect
   righteousness and truth. The adverb, m'd, meod, which signifies
   greatly, is with more propriety connected with the nouns than with the
   verb commanded; inasmuch as it was God's design to exhibit in the law a
   perfect rule of righteousness. The doctrine of the law is honored with
   these encomiums, that all of us may learn to derive wisdom from it, and
   that no man may devise for himself any other standard of rectitude or
   righteousness than that which is exhibited in the law; a very necessary
   lesson, since every man would willingly frame for himself a new pattern
   or standard of righteousness.

   139. My zeal hath consumed me. [17] The Psalmist speaks of his
   persecutors, by whom it is certain he had been subjected to much
   trouble. But although they were virulent and cruel towards him, he
   avows that it was not so much his own private wrongs which offended him
   as the violation of God's law; yea rather, that he was so consumed with
   grief on that account as not to be affected at all with his own
   individual troubles. This is an example from which much profit may be
   derived. We are too tender and delicate in bearing wrongs; and hence it
   is that if we are but touched with a finger, we are instantly inflamed
   with anger, whilst at the same time we are but coldly affected at the
   most grievous offenses committed against God. But if we are animated
   with the zeal that inspired the Prophet it will carry us away to
   another kind of sorrow, which will take entire possession of our souls.

   140. Thy word is exceedingly refined. In this verse he intimates that
   the cause of his zeal was the love which he bore to heavenly doctrine.
   For to be displeased with or severely to condemn the contempt of divine
   truth, unless we are bound to it by the cords of love, is pure
   hypocrisy. And he affirms that his love to God's word was not a rash,
   or a blind and inconsiderate affection, but that he loved it, because
   like gold or silver which has been refined, it was pure and free from
   all dregs and dross. This is the idea contained in the metaphorical
   term tsrvphh, tseruphah, translated refined; [18] and though it seems
   to be commonplace, yet, vindicating God's word from all perverse and
   malicious judgments, it expresses graphically the true obedience of
   faith. How few are there who are not guilty, either by their distrust,
   or waywardness, or pride, or voluptuousness, of casting upon God's word
   some spot or stain! The flesh then being so rebellious, it is no small
   commendation of revealed truth, when it is compared to gold well
   refined, so that it shines pure from all defilement. Farther, it serves
   not a little to show the truth of this testimony, that the Prophet
   confirms it by his own experience. The more effectually to repress the
   foolish rashness with which we are chargeable whenever we imagine that
   there is any fault in God's word, he declares that in commending it he
   gives utterance to the unfeigned feeling of his heart, having
   experienced a blissful pleasure in that purity of which he speaks.

   141. I am, insignificant and despised. The meaning is, that although he
   was tried with poverty and many other calamities, he steadily
   persevered in the exercise of true godliness, and in the observance of
   the law. On that account, as he states, he was despised by wicked men.
   Every man gives praise to God just in proportion as he is gorged with
   his benefits; and very few will be found applying their minds to the
   service of God, unless they have all their wishes gratified. Hence it
   comes to pass that hypocrites, as long as they are pampered to the
   full, accumulate riches and increase in power, are very lavish in
   praising God. But let them be treated in some degree roughly, and
   immediately the blessed name of God is heard of no more. Since then men
   are ordinarily mercenary in serving God, let us learn from the
   Prophet's example that true godliness is disinterested, so that when
   under its influence we cease not to praise God, although he may afflict
   us with adversity and make us despised in the eyes of the world. These
   upbraiding words of Christ in John 6:26, ought, no doubt, to be
   carefully attended to,

   "Ye seek me, not because ye saw the miracles, but because ye did eat of
   the loaves, and were filled." (John 6:26)

   The persons then who serve God ingenuously and sincerely, are such as
   continue steadfast in his fear, although their condition in this world
   may be mean and despised; in short, they are such as seek not their
   reward on earth, but through heat and cold, poverty and danger,
   slanders and mockeries, persevere with unwearied steps in the course of
   their warfare.

   142. Thy righteousness is an everlasting righteousness. Here the law of
   God is honored by the additional encomium, that it is everlasting
   righteousness and truth; as if it had been said, that all other rules
   of life, with whatever attractions they may appear to be recommended,
   are but a shadow, which quickly vanishes away. The Psalmist, no doubt,
   indirectly contrasts the doctrine of the law with all the human
   precepts which were ever delivered, that he may bring all the faithful
   in subjection to it, since it is the school of perfect wisdom. There
   may be more of plausibility in the refined and subtle disquisition's of
   men; but there is in them nothing firm or solid at bottom, as there is
   in God's law. This firmness of the divine law he proves in the
   following verse from one instance -- the continual comfort he found in
   it when grievously harassed with temptations. And the true test of the
   profit we have reaped from it is, when we oppose to all the distresses
   of whatever kind which may straiten us, the consolation derived from
   the word of God, that thereby all sadness may be effaced from our
   minds. David here expresses something more than he did in the preceding
   verse; for there he only said that he reverently served God, although
   from his rough and hard treatment he might seem to lose his labor; but
   now when distressed and tormented, he affirms that he finds in the law
   of God the most soothing delight, which mitigates all grief's, and not
   only tempers their bitterness, but also seasons them with a certain
   sweetness. And assuredly when this taste does not exist to afford us
   delight, nothing is more natural than for us to be swallowed up of
   sorrow. Nor ought we to omit noticing the form of expression which the
   Prophet employs, by which he teaches, that although he was besieged and
   shut up on all sides, he found a remedy sufficiently powerful in
   improving the consolation offered him by the word of God. As this could
   not be true of the bare commandments, which so far from remedying our
   distresses, rather fill us with anxiety, there is no doubt that under
   the word commandments there is comprehended by the figure synecdoche,
   the whole doctrine of the law, in which God not only requires what is
   right, but in which also calling his elect ones to the hope of eternal
   salvation, he opens the gate of perfect happiness. Yea, under the term
   law are comprehended both free adoption, and also the promises which
   flow from it.

   144. The righteousness of thy testimonies endureth forever. The
   Psalmist repeats what he had already before stated, that there is a
   great dissimilarity between the righteousness of God's testimonies and
   man's inventions; the splendor of the last quickly vanishing away,
   whereas the other continues steadfast for ever. He repeats this twice;
   for although the world is forced to attribute the praise of
   righteousness to the law of God, yet the majority of mankind are
   carried away after their own speculations, so that there is nothing
   more difficult than to hold us fast in our obedience to God. David's
   drift is to show that everlasting righteousness is not comprehended
   elsewhere than in God's law, and that it is in vain to seek for it
   anywhere else; and there is accordingly here laid down a clearer
   definition of righteousness, which is, that righteousness consists in
   our keeping ourselves within the bounds of the law. As to the last
   clause of the verse, Give me understanding and I shall live, I read it
   in connection with the preceding clause; for although David desires to
   have his mind enlightened by God, yet he does not conceive of any other
   way by which he was to obtain an enlightened understanding than by his
   profiting aright in the study of the law. Farther, he here teaches,
   that men cannot, properly speaking, be said to live when they are
   destitute of the light of heavenly wisdom; and as the end for which men
   are created is not that, like swine or asses, they may stuff their
   bellies, but that they may exercise themselves in the knowledge and
   service of God, when they turn away from such employment, their life is
   worse than a thousand deaths. David therefore protests that for him to
   live was not merely to be fed with meat and drink, and to enjoy earthly
   comforts, but to aspire after a better life, which he could not do save
   under the guidance of faith. This is a very necessary warning; for
   although it is universally acknowledged that man is born with this
   distinction, that he excels the lower animals in intelligence, yet the
   great bulk of mankind, as if with deliberate purpose: stifle whatever
   light God pours into their understandings. I indeed admit that all men
   desire to be sharp-witted; but how few aspire to heaven, and consider
   that the fear of,God is the beginning of wisdom. Since then meditation
   upon the celestial life is buried by earthly cares, men do nothing else
   than plunge into the grave, so that while living to the world, they die
   to God. Under the term life, however, as I have elsewhere said, the
   Prophet denotes the utmost he could wish. Lord, as if he had said,
   although I am already dead, yet if thou art pleased to illumine my mind
   with the knowledge of heavenly truth, this grace alone will be
   sufficient to revive me.

   [17] "Hath consumed me. The strong term here made use of corresponds
   very well with the forcible language of the preceding verse. My zeal
   for thy word is so great, that when I see how my enemies disregard it,
   I am overpowered by feelings of shame at their neglect." -- Phillips.

   [18] Dr. Adam Clarke translates tsrvphh, tseruphah, by purification.
   This rendering conveys a beautiful idea. God's word is not only a
   purified thing, but a thing that purifies. It cleanses from sin every
   heart with which it comes into contact. "Now ye are clean," said
   Christ,
   "by the word which I have spoken unto you." (John 15:3.) This tendency
   of the word to impart a measure of its own purity to such as yield to
   its influence, endears it to all God's people; and for this reason they
   make it the subject of their constant meditation.

   Psalm 119:145-152

   145. q I have cried with my whole heart; answer me, O Jehovah! and I
   will keep thy statutes. 146. q I have called upon thee; save me, and I
   will keep thy testimonies. 147. q I have prevented the twilight, [19]
   and have cried: I have looked up to thy word. 148. q My eyes have
   prevented the night-watches, to meditate upon thy word. 149. q Hear my
   yoke, O Jehovah! According to thy mercy, quicken me according to thy
   judgment. 150. q The pursuers of malice have drawn near; they have
   departed from thy law. 151. q Thou, O Jehovah! art near; and all thy
   commandments are truth. 152. q I have known from thy testimonies from
   the beginning that thou hast established them for ever.


   145 I have cried with my whole heart. This verse may be so read and
   connected as that in the end of it the Psalmist may show what he
   desired in crying; [20] and thus the meaning would be, that as he was
   inflamed with an intense desire to keep the law, he continually made
   supplication to God on that subject. But the subsequent verse compels
   us to take a different view, for the same thing is, no doubt, there
   again repeated. The Prophet then requests that God would hear him; and
   in token of his gratitude he promises to keep God's commandments. He
   simply uses the indefinite term cry; and thus he does not express what
   the prayers were which he offered up to God, but only shows, that while
   the children of this world are distracted by a multiplicity of objects,
   he directed all the affections of his heart exclusively to God, because
   he depended solely on him. As the world is compelled to acknowledge
   that God is the author of all good things, many formal prayers proceed
   from that principle. It was the consideration of this which led David
   to affirm that he prayed with his whole heart. When he shall have
   obtained his requests, he proposes to himself the glory of God as his
   end, resolving to devote himself with so much the more ardent affection
   to the work of serving him. Although God declares that he is served
   aright by the sacrifice of praise, yet David, to distinguish himself
   from hypocrites who profane the name of God by their cold and feigned
   praises, with good reason declares that he will give thanks by his life
   and works.

   In the following verse he makes no new statement; but he speaks more
   expressly. In the first place, he says that he cried to God; and next
   he adds, that he commended his welfare to Him by prayer; thereby
   intimating that whether he was in safety, or whether imminent danger
   threatened him with death, he uniformly reposed upon God, being fully
   persuaded that the only way in which he could continue safe was by
   having him for the guardian and protector of his welfare.

   147. I have prevented the twilight. The Hebrew noun nsph, nesheph, is
   in this place improperly translated by crepusculum, twilight; for it
   rather signifies the dawn of morning. But as the Latin's derive the
   word crepusculum, from creperus, which signifies doubtful or uncertain,
   so that it may signify the doubtful and intermediate time between light
   and darkness, I have not been particularly nice in the selection of the
   term only let my readers understand that the evening twilight
   commencing with sunset is not here denoted, but the imperfect light
   which precedes the rising of the sun. David then expresses the most
   eager haste when he says, that he prevented the dawn of the morning by
   his prayers. The verb cry always conveys the idea of earnestness;
   referring, as it does, not so much to the loudness of the voice as to
   the vehemency and ardor of the mind. In mentioning his haste, his
   object is the better to set forth his perseverance; for he tells us,
   that although he betook himself to prayer with such promptitude, yet he
   did not immediately become weary of that exercise, like the
   unbelieving, who, if God does not suddenly grant them their requests,
   murmur and complain against him. Thus, in conjoining patience of hope
   with earnestness of desire, he shows what is the true manner of
   praying; even as Paul, in Philippians 4:6, when he exhorts us to

   "let our requests be made known unto God with thanksgiving,"
   (Philippians 4:6)

   admonishes us, while engaged in the exercise of prayer, to bridle our
   turbulent affections, because one of the ends of prayer is to nourish
   our hope. Nor is the mention made of the word in the close of the verse
   superfluous; for it is only by having the Word of God continually
   before our eyes, that we can bridle the wanton impetuosity of our
   corrupt nature.

   148. My eyes have prevented the night watchers. [21] The Psalmist here
   intimates, that he was more sedulously intent on meditating upon the
   law of God than watchmen of the night were to keep watch. Others are of
   opinion, that the verb svch, suach, is put for to discourse. If this
   opinion is admitted, the sense will be, that the Prophet, not from
   ostentation, but for the welfare of his brethren, was so desirous of
   communicating instruction, that he gave himself no rest. The word
   meditate is, however, more appropriate in this place; for the night is
   an unseasonable time for discoursing upon the law of God; but at that
   season, when alone, he silently recalled to his memory what he had
   previously learned, so that he passed no part of the night without
   meditating upon the law.

   149. Hear my voice, O Jehovah! according to thy mercy. In the first
   place he declares, that the goodness of God was the only ground of his
   hope of being heard by him. Whatever blessings the saints may plead for
   in prayer, their opening argument must be the free and unmerited grace
   of God. Nor is the term judgments [22] in the second clause to be taken
   in a different sense. As God has revealed his goodness in his word, his
   word is the source from which we must derive our assurance of his
   goodness. The Prophet, then, sensible that he had need of the divine
   mercy, betook himself directly to the word, in which God, sweetly
   alluring men to himself, promises that his grace will be ready and open
   for all. That each, therefore, may be confidently persuaded that God
   will be merciful to him in particular, let him learn from the example
   of the Prophet to entreat God to show himself such as he has promised
   to be. Some expound the word judgments by manner or custom; [23]
   because, God's usual way is to deal graciously with all his people. I
   would not altogether reject this exposition; but I think it is harsh
   and foreign to the scope of the text, while the meaning which I have
   adduced comes out very naturally. Moreover, he desires to be quickened,
   to testify that even in the, midst of life he is dead, except in so far
   as he is sustained by the power of God. And assuredly, all who are duly
   acquainted with their own infirmity, esteeming their life as nothing,
   will crave to be quickened every moment. It is also to be added, that
   God often so exercised his servant, that with good reason he might send
   up his prayers, as it were, out of the sepulcher, to be restored from
   death to life.

   150. The pursuers of malice have drawn near. As the Hebrew word rvdphy
   rodphee, translated the pursuers of, is put in the construct state,
   that is to say, as it is so related to the word zmh, zimmah, rendered
   wickedness, that in Latin the latter would be put in the genitive ease,
   I expound the clause as denoting that they draw near to do mischief. I
   wonder what could move interpreters to translate -- The pursuers have
   approached, or drawn near to wickedness; which the idiom of the
   language will not admit, to say nothing of the fact that zmh, zimmah,
   signifies rather perversity or malice, than wickedness. David therefore
   says, that those who are vehemently bent on malice are pursuing him
   close behind, and that they rush upon him with such violence in order
   to do him mischief, as plainly to indicate that they are far off from
   God's law, since they east far from them all regard to uprightness and
   equity. It was a most wretched condition for him to be in, to behold
   his enemies, who had shaken off all fear of God and reverence for his
   law, ready with uplifted hand to smite him to death, had not God been
   near to defend him, as he adds in the subsequent verse --

   151. Thou, O Jehovah! art near. He encourages himself from the
   consolatory consideration, that God, when he sees his own people sore
   pressed, comes forward, seasonably to afford them succor; even as Paul
   on this subject says,

   "Be not over-careful, the Lord is at hand, let your moderation be known
   to all men "
   (Philippians 4:5)

   The concluding sentence of the verse is to this effect, That God never
   forsakes nor disappoints his people in their necessity, because he is
   true to his promises; and in them he assures us, that the welfare of
   his people will always be the object of his care. That therefore we may
   be fully persuaded that the hand of God is always ready to repulse the
   assaults of our enemies, let us retain a settled belief of the truth,
   that he does not in vain promise in his word to be the guardian of our
   welfare.

   152. I have known from thy testimonies [24] from the beginning. Others
   here translate, I have known long ago of thy testimonies. [25] This
   translation I would not directly reject; but I am more inclined to
   retain the sense which I have given, namely, That the Prophet not only
   knew the everlasting steadfastness which characterizes the testimonies
   of God; but that he had also derived this knowledge from the
   testimonies themselves. When the Hebrews would express the meaning
   conveyed by the Latin preposition de, they frequently use the particle
   mn, or the letter v, beth. He therefore says, that he had learned from
   God's testimonies, or had been taught by them, that they are
   established for ever [26] This indeed is the chief point of faith, That
   the word of God is not only distinguished for fidelity and
   steadfastness for a time, but that it continues unchangeable for ever.
   Were it otherwise, it could not include within it the hope of eternal
   salvation. That the assurance of this immutabiliy of God's word may be
   rooted in our minds, the inward revelation of the Holy Spirit is indeed
   necessary; for until God seal within us the certainty of his word, our
   belief of its certainty will be continually wavering. Yet the Prophet,
   not without cause, affirms, that he learned this truth from the word;
   for when God shines into us by his Spirit, he at the same time causes
   that sacred truth which endures for ever to shine forth in the mirror
   of his word.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [19] The word which Calvin uses for "the twilight" is "crepusculum."

   [20] According to this view, the last clause would read, "that I may
   keep thy statutes."

   [21] The Hebrews divided the natural day into three portions--morning,
   noon, and evening -- which are mentioned by David as seasons in which
   he engaged in prayer. (Psalm 55:17.) They also divided the night into
   three parts, called "watches," consisting of four hours each, and
   commencing at our six o'clock in the evening. In Lamentations 2:19, we
   read of the first watch; or, as it is there designated, "the beginning
   of the watches;" in Judges 7:19, of "the middle watch;" and in Exodus
   14:24, of "the morning watch." A similar division of the night seems to
   have been made by other ancient nations, as appears from the references
   made to it by Homer and the early Greek writers. The Greeks and Romans,
   however, in improving their military discipline, afterwards divided the
   night into four watches, each consisting of three hours; and when the
   Jews fell under the dominion of the latter people, they adopted from
   them this division of the night. Hence we read of "the fourth watch of
   the night" in Matthew 14:25. And the four watches are mentioned
   together in Mark 13:35: "Watch ye therefore: for ye know not when the
   master of the house cometh, at even, or at midnight, or at
   cock-crowing,
   or in the morning." The time at which each of these four watches began
   and ended is thus determined by Dr. Hales, who has written elaborately
   on the subject: "1. Opse, the late, began at sunset, and ended with the
   third hour of the night, including the evening-dawn, or twilight. It
   was also called opsia hora, eventide, Mark 11:11; or simply opsia,
   evening, John 20:19, etc. 2. Mesonuktion, the midnight, lasted from the
   third hour till midnight. 3. Alektorophonia, the cock-crowing, midnight
   till the third hour after, or the ninth hour of the night. It included
   the two cock-crowings, with the second or principal of which it ended.
   4. Proi, the early, lasted from the ninth to the twelfth hor of the
   night, or sunrise, including the morning-dawn or twilight. It is also
   called proia, morning, or morningtide, (hora being understood,) John
   18:28, etc. "When the Psalmist here declares, that his eyes prevented
   the nightwatches, we are to understand him as chiefly referring to the
   middle and morning watches, which falling at that period of the night
   when men in general are devoted to rest, envinced the strength,
   fervour, and self-sacrificing character of his devotions." -- Dr.
   Morison.

   [22] By "judgments," Calvin means "God's Word," as the reader will
   observe from what follows.

   [23] Walford translates, "Revive me, e Jehovah! according to thy wonted
   manner."

   [24] "De testimoniis tuis." -- Lat.

   [25] Walford's rendering is, "I have known thy testimonies long since."
   Phillips translates "of old;" and gives this explanation, "I have been
   acquainted with thy testimonies ever since I have possessed any
   knowledge, i.e. as soon as I came to years of reflection. From a child
   thou hast known the holy scriptures.'
   2 Timothy 3:15."

   [26] Thou hast established them for ever. That is, thy revelations are
   unalterable and everlasting, as the attributes of their great Author,
   and can never fail those who rely upon them, in time, or in eternity."
   -- Warner on the Psalter.

   Psalm 119:153-160

   153. r Behold my affliction, and rescue me: for I have not forgotten
   thy law. 154. r Debate my cause, and redeem me: quicken thy according
   to thy word. 155. r Safety is far from the wicked; because they have
   not sought thy statutes. 156. r O Jehovah! Thy tender mercies are many:
   quicken me according to thy judgments. 157. r My persecutors and
   oppressors are many: [27] I have not swerved from thy testimonies. 158.
   r I saw the perfidious, and chid them; because they have not kept thy
   word. 159. r Behold O Jehovah! how have loved thy commandments: quicken
   me according to thy loving kindness. 160. r The beginning [literally,
   the head [28] ] of thy word is truth; and all the judgment of thy
   righteousness is everlasting.


   153. Behold my affliction and rescue me. The Psalmist teaches by his
   own example that those who are devoted to the service and fear of God,
   must not be discouraged though they are not rewarded for it in this
   world. Their condition upon earth is one of warfare, and therefore they
   should not be dismayed by diversity, but rather rest satisfied with the
   consolatory consideration, that the gate of prayer is open to them. Yet
   the Prophet does not boast of his, endeavors to keep the law, as if he
   would have God to pay him wages for his service, but only to show that
   he was one of God's servants, just as he has spoken of his hope that he
   was so in other places. This reason, for I have not forgotten thy law,
   on account of which he beseeches God to consider his affliction and to
   rescue him, is peculiarly forcible in the present case; for it is an
   evidence of no ordinary courage when, instead of being led away from
   the fear of God by adversity, we wrestle against temptations and seek
   him even when he seems purposely to drive us away from him.

   154. Debate thy cause, and redeem me. In this verse David specifics the
   kind of his affliction, which was the wrongful and harassing treatment
   which he met with at the hands of evil and unprincipled men. The
   reading literally is, Plead my cause, which is the same thing as to
   undertake a cause, or to take the charge of defending one in judgment,
   or to maintain the right of the oppressed. In the first place the
   Prophet in invoking God to defend his cause, shows that he is
   wrongfully oppressed, either by violence, calumnies, or crafty
   policies; and in seeking to be redeemed, he intimates that he was
   unable to make any resistance, or that he was so entangled in their
   snares, as to have no remaining hope except in the deliverance of God.
   In the second clause the letter l, lamed, seems to be taken for the
   letter k, caph, the mark of similitude, [29] as would appear from his
   having used a little before (Psalm 119:149) a similar form of prayer.
   Again, as David here complains that he is held as it were in fetters by
   his enemies, unless he is delivered by the hand of his Redeemer, he
   with good reason beseeches God to restore him to life; for he who is
   rims abased is like a person dead. It is also aptly added according to
   thy word; for it is from the promises which God makes in his word of
   becoming our deliverer that the hope of life shines upon us. Whence the
   Prophet, when earnestly desiring to be brought from darkness to light,
   sustains and encourages himself by the word. If a different sense is
   preferred, then David is not to be understood as simply asking that
   life may be given him, but as praying for spiritual life, that he may
   be encouraged to exercise faith, to cultivate the fear of God, and to
   cherish the desire of living a holy life.

   155 Safety is far from the wicked. Fully persuaded that the world is
   governed by the secret providence of God, who is a just judge, the
   Prophet draws from that source the doctrine, That the wicked are far
   removed from safety, and safety from them. Hence proceeds the
   confidence of prayer; for as God is turned away from the despisers of
   his word, so he is ready to succor his servants. It is to be noticed,
   that when the Prophet saw that his enemies were elated by their
   prosperity, he on the contrary lifted up his heart by faith that thus
   he might come to the settled persuasion that all their delights were
   cursed and tended to destruction. Whenever then the wicked prosper in
   the world according to their wishes, so that being pampered to the full
   they exult in their own fatness, let us learn, in order to defend
   ourselves, to lay hold upon this buckler which the Holy Spirit is
   holding out to us, namely, that they shall at length miserably perish,
   because they seek not the commandments of God. From this we draw a
   contrary doctrine, That although genuine believers, whilst they walk
   sincerely in the fear of God may be as sheep appointed to the
   slaughter, yet their salvation, which is under the special care and
   protection of God's secret providence, is just at hand. In this sense
   the Prophet adds in the following verse,

   156. O Jehovah,! thy tender mercies are many; as if he had said that no
   offenders are safe but those who betake themselves to the divine mercy.
   Farther, to encourage himself to approach God with the greater
   confidence, he not only says that God is merciful, but he mightily
   magnifies and extols his compassion's. From this we gather that he was
   so contented with them, as not to seek any aid from his own merits. It
   is however at the same time to be noted, that the Prophet was far from
   being lightly troubled with many temptations, seeing he was forced to
   oppose to them this vast abundance of mercy. It makes little difference
   whether we read great or many The prayer which follows, Quicken me
   according to thy judgments, I explain as referring to the promises. The
   original word for judgment is by some translated manner or custom; but
   I have already shown above that such a translation is less suitable
   than the other. The Prophet then again confirms the truth, That life
   cannot be hoped for or asked from God, unless hope is produced by his
   word; and he often repeats this truth, because it is one of which we
   are marvelously forgetful. But that we may boldly appropriate to
   ourselves all the grace which God promises to his servants, let the
   doctrine of the great and manifold tender mercies of God be ever
   present to our thoughts. If we imagine that God makes his promises
   because he is bound to do it, or because we have deserved it, doubting
   or mistrust will steal upon our minds, which will shut the gate against
   our prayers. But if we are thoroughly persuaded that the sole cause by
   which God is moved to promise us salvation is the mercy inherent in his
   own nature, we will approach him without hesitation or doubt, because
   he has bound himself to us of his own accord.

   157. My persecutors and oppressors are many. The Psalmist here as in
   other places testifies, that although he had been provoked by many
   injuries, yet he had not departed from the right way; which, as I have
   elsewhere observed, was an evidence of great and singular constancy. It
   is an easy matter to act well when we are among the good; but if wicked
   men afflict us, if one man openly assault us by force, if another rob
   us of our property, if a third circumvent us by wiles, and a fourth
   attack us by calumnies, it is difficult for us to persevere in our
   integrity, and we rather begin to howl among the wolves. Besides, the
   license which is allowed them of doing what they please without the
   fear of being punished, is a powerful engine for shaking our faith,
   because, when God thus winks at the wicked, he seems to abandon us for
   a prey. The Prophet therefore, by God's testimonies, means not only the
   rule of holy and righteous living, but also the promises. Lord, as if
   he had said, I have not turned away from the path of integrity,
   although the conduct of the wicked has presented me with a temptation
   to do so; nor have I shaken off nay confidence in thy grace, but have
   waited patiently for thy succor. Both these are necessary. For although
   he who has suffered wrongs may contend against the malice of his
   enemies by his well -- doing, and may refrain from every act of
   retaliation, yet, provided he does not depend wholly upon God, this
   uprightness will not be sufficient to save him. Not that any man
   behaves himself in a manner so moderate, except he who leans upon God
   and waits upon him as his deliverer; but granting that such could be
   the ease, there would not be sufficient power in this half virtue to
   save him. The salvation of God is reserved for the faithful who ask it
   in the exercise of lively faith. And whoever, persuaded that God will
   be his deliverer, pillars and supports his mind on the divine promises,
   will endeavor also to overcome evil with good.

   158. I saw the perfidious and child them. In this verse the Psalmist
   proceeds yet farther, declaring that he was inflamed with a holy zeal
   when he saw the law of God despised by the wicked. Expositors are not
   however agreed as to one word in the text, namely the verb 'tqvtth,
   ethkotatah, which we have rendered chid, some deriving it from qvt,
   kut, which often signifies to debate or contend with, it being in the
   conjugation hithpael, while others derive it from qtt karat, which
   signifies to kill or to destroy. I adopt the former interpretation,
   because it is more generally received among the learned, and is most
   appropriate. The Prophet then teaches that he was inflamed with such
   zeal for the law of God that he could no longer endure the impious
   mockery directed against it. The verb debate may however be understood
   as well of the vexation or anger which he felt in himself, as of the
   rebuke which he openly administered to the despisers of God; and
   therefore some translate it, I shuddered, or I was grieved [30] Nor
   assuredly will any person enter into debate with others for maintaining
   the glory of God, but he who is first chafed within himself, and has
   been grieved at heart; even as on the other hand, after this holy
   indignation there almost always follows transitive action; that is to
   say, it passes from the thought to the effect. [31] In short, we are
   admonished by the example of the Prophet, that we ought to feel such
   displeasure at the contempt of God's word as that our heart grows hot
   even to chiding. In the first place, then, let grief affect us
   inwardly; and next, whenever opportunity shall present itself, let; us
   strenuously endeavor to repress the forwardness and pride of the
   wicked, and let us not hesitate to do so from the fear of provoking
   their resentment against us.

   159. Behold, O Jehovah how I have loved thy commandments. What I have
   state before must be remembered -- that when the saints speak of their
   own piety before God they are not chargeable with obtruding their own
   merits as the ground of their confidence; but they regard this as, a
   settled principle, that God, who distinguishes his servants from the
   profane and wicked, will be merciful to them because they seek him with
   their whole heart. Besides, an unfeigned love of God's law is an
   undoubted evidence of adoption, since this love is the work of the Holy
   Spirit. The Prophet, therefore, although he arrogates nothing to
   himself, very properly adduces his own piety for the purpose, of
   encouraging himself to entertain the more assured hope of obtaining his
   request, through the grace of God which he had experienced. At the same
   time we are taught that there can be no true keeping of the law but
   what springs from free and spontaneous love. God demands voluntary
   sacrifices, and the commencement of a good life is to love him, as
   Moses declares, (Deuteronomy 10:12,)

   "And now, O Israel! what doth the Lord require of thee,
   but to love him."

   The same thing is also repeated in the summary of the law: (Deuteronomy
   6:5,) "Thou shalt love the Lord thy God." For this reason David has
   previously stated, that the law of God was not only precious but also
   delightful to him. Now as in keeping the law it behoves us to begin
   with voluntary obedience, so that nothing may delight us more than the
   righteousness of God, so on the other hand, it must not be forgotten
   that a sense of the free goodness of God and of his fatherly love is
   indispensably necessary in order to our hearts being beheld to this
   affection. So far are the bare commandment's from winning men to obey
   them, that they rather frighten them away. Hence it is evident, that it
   is only when a man shall have tasted the goodness of God from the
   teaching of the law, that he will apply his heart to love it in return.
   The frequency with which the Prophet repeats the prayer, that God would
   quicken him, teaches us that he knew well the frailty of his own life,
   so that in his estimation men live only in so far as God every moment
   breathes life into them. Besides, it is probable that he had been
   continually besieged by many deaths, to the end he might the more
   earnestly betake himself to the fountain of life. He again rests his
   faith upon the goodness of God as its foundation -- quicken me
   according to thy loving-kindness -- from which we perceive how far he
   was from boasting of his own merits when he protested in the preceding
   sentence that he loved God's law.

   160. The beginning of thy word is truth. The design of the Prophet it
   is not difficult to perceive; but the words admit of being understood
   in two ways. Some interpret the noun beginning as denoting that the
   truth of God shines forth conspicuously in his word, immediately when
   we enter for the first time upon the study of it, so that this entrance
   may justly be called the beginning of the word. This sentence contains
   the profitable doctrine, that if we are finished with eyes of
   understanding, we will no sooner cast our eyes upon heavenly doctrine
   than the truth of it will meet our view. Others, however, give a
   different explanation, and perhaps with no less propriety, eliciting
   this sense, That the word of God has been from the beginning certain
   and infallible truth, and will continue so even to the end. These two
   clauses hang very well together -- that God has been true to his word
   from the beginning, and that he will continue to be so everlastingly
   and immutably. The interpretation which refers the word judgment to the
   works of God and not to his doctrine, I would not altogether condemn,
   yet it is not in harmony with the context. Let us then retain this
   sense, That from the time when God began to speak he has always been
   faithful to his promises, and has never disappointed the hope of his
   people; and that the course of this faithfulness has been so uniform,
   that from the beginning even to the end his word is true and faithful.

   Psalm 119:161-168

   161. s Princes have persecuted me without a cause; yet my heart hath
   beer, afraid at thy word 162. s I have rejoiced at thy word as one who
   hath found great spoil. 163. s I have hated and abhorred deceit; but I
   have loved thy law. 164. s Seven times a day have I praised thee,
   because of thy righteous judgments. [32] 165. s Great peace have them
   that love thy law, and there will be no stumbling-block for them. [33]
   166. s Jehovah I have waited for thy salvation and have done thy
   commandments. 167. s My soul hath kept thy testimonies, and I have
   loved them exceeding. 168. s I have kept thy commandments and thy
   testimonies; for all my ways are before thee.


   161 Princes have persecuted me without a cause. [34] Here the Psalmist,
   informs us that sore and grievous as his temptation had been, he was
   restrained by the fear of God from desiring to attempt anything
   unworthy of the character of a godly man. We are prone to fall into
   despair when princes who are armed with power to overwhelm us are
   hostile to and molest us. The evil is also aggravated from the
   consideration that it is the very persons who ought to be as bucklers
   to defend us, who employ their strength in hurting us. Yea, when the
   afflicted are stricken by those in high places, they in a manner think
   that the hand of God is against them. There was also this peculiarity
   in the case of the Prophet, that he had to encounter the grandees of
   the chosen people -- men whom God had placed in such honor-able
   stations, to the end they might be the pillars of the Church. Some
   give, more restricted exposition, which is, that David followed the
   exhortation of Christ in Matthew 10:28,

   "Fear not them who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul,
   but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell;"

   a sentiment which although it had not as yet been uttered by Christ's
   mouth, ought nevertheless to have been fixed in the hearts of all the
   godly. The sense, then, in their opinion is, that the Prophet had not
   been turned aside from the fear of God by any of the threatening or
   terrors of his enemies. But his commendation of his own constancy is to
   be understood in a more extended sense than this. The exhortation of
   Isaiah is well known,

   "Neither fear ye their fear, nor be afraid; sanctify the Lord of hosts
   himself; and let him be your fear, and let him be your dread." (Isaiah
   8:12,13)

   The Prophet in that place shows in general what the weapons are, with
   which the faithful being armed will succeed in vanquishing all the
   assaults of the world -- he shows that they will do so, provided they
   not only stand in awe of God, but also rest assured that he will always
   be the guardian of their welfare, so that they may cast all their cares
   upon him. Thus it will come to pass that, resting contented with his
   protection, they will not turn aside to practice whatever may be sinful
   to secure their safety. In like manner the Prophet, in the passage
   before us, affirms that although being oppressed by the wrongful
   violence of princes, he presented a sad spectacle, yet he did not
   succumb, but considered what was lawful for him to do, and did not
   attempt to rival their wicked practices, by repelling craft with craft
   and violence with violence. In this text, as is evident from the
   connection, to be afraid at God's word, is to restrain one's self and
   to attempt nothing which is unlawful. I have already said that the
   adverb chnm, hinnam, without a cause, is added for the sake of
   amplification; for the temptation was so much the harder from the fact,
   that the tyrants, without cause and merely to gratify their own wicked
   inclination, assaulted an innocent individual. Men of a good
   disposition and of a noble mind, it is well known, are more easily
   excited to anger when the object assaulted is one who has done wrong to
   nobody. It was therefore a signal proof of self-control for the Prophet
   to bridle himself by the word of God, that he might not vie with others
   in evil doing, or, overcome with temptation, go out of the place which
   had been assigned him in the social body. Let us then learn to remain
   peaceable, although princes tyrannically abuse the power which God has
   committed to them, lest by creating insurrection we break in upon the
   peace and order of society.

   162. I have rejoiced at thy word as one who hath found great spoil No
   gain, it is well known, brings greater joy than that which conquerors
   acquire from the spoil of their enemies; for to the gain there is added
   the glory of triumph; and when profit comes on a sudden, the delight
   experienced is from that circumstance the greater. This is the reason
   why David compares the knowledge he had obtained of heavenly doctrine
   with spoils rather than with other riches; for by these words he
   intimates that his greatest joy was derived from the word of God, to
   which no gain however desirable could at all approach. From this was
   learn that he was contented with the word of God as a thing in which
   was all his delight, and in which he found solid felicity; which could
   not be, but, in the way of his first withdrawing his heart from all
   depraved desires. Nor is it wonderful to find David placing the whole
   sum of a happy life in the word of God, in which he well knew the
   treasure of eternal life to be included and offered to him by means of
   free adoption.

   163. I have hated and abhorred deceit. In this verse he declares more
   distinctly what I have adverted to a little before, that he was
   cleansed from corrupt affections that he might bestow upon the law of
   God such honor and estimation as it deserved. Having elsewhere met with
   almost the same sentence, I shall but briefly touch upon the reason why
   the Prophet affirms that he hated deceit before he speaks of his love
   and devotedness to the law. As hypocrisy is in the hearts of all men by
   nature, and as we are naturally prone to vanity and deceitfulness, we
   ought diligently to labor to purge our hearts, that the love of the law
   may reign in them. Now if the beginning of a good life and the first
   point of righteousness is to hate and abhor deceit, it follows that
   nothing is more excellent than integrity; for unless that virtue hold
   the chief place, all the other virtues speedily disappear. Nor is
   abhorring superfluously added to hating, the design being to teach us
   that it is not enough to hate falsehood with a common hatred, but that
   God's children must hate it with a deadly hatred. Now if the love of
   the law and the hatred of falsehood are inseparably conjoined, it is a
   plain inference that all who are not taught in the school of God are
   infected with deceit and hypocrisy.

   164. Seven times a day have I praised thee. By the adverb seven times,
   the Prophet means that he was continually or very often engaged in
   celebrating the praises of God; just as it is said in Proverbs 24:16,
   "A just man falleth seven times," when he often falls into divers
   temptations. [35] The phrase the judgments of God being in many places
   taken for the punishments which God inflicts upon sinners, and also
   sometimes applied in general to the providence by which he governs the
   world, some understand the Prophet as praising God because he affords
   such manifest proofs of his justice both in punishing the wicked and in
   the whole government of the world. But I rather agree with others who
   refer the phrase to the divine law; not that I dislike the former
   interpretation, but because in this psalm the great topic upon which
   the Psalmist chiefly insists is the commendation of God's law. The
   amount then is, that when David was assiduously occupied in meditating
   upon the law of God, he found it distinguished by so great perfection
   of righteousness and wisdom, that from time to time he burst forth into
   the exercise of praise and thanksgiving. This diligence in praising God
   shows that David not only spoke reverently and honourably of the divine
   law, but that he accounted it an inestimable boon conferred upon the
   human race. It was not simply admiration which constrained him to this
   commendation, but a principle of gratitude; for he saw that nothing
   more excellent could be bestowed upon men than their being renewed to a
   blessed and an endless life by the incorruptible seed of heavenly
   truth. Yet scarcely one in a hundred of those to whom God offers this
   treasure puts himself to the trouble of giving God thanks for it even
   in an ordinary manner. On the contrary, there reigns such vile
   ingratitude everywhere in the world, that some scornfully reject divine
   truth, and others despise or slight it, while others rail and gnash
   their teeth against it if they find anything in it which does not
   please them.

   165. Great peace have they who love thy law. If we take the word peace
   for a prosperous or happy condition of life -- a sense in which the
   Hebrews often employ it -- the word rendered stumbling-block, to
   correspond with it, will be used for adversity; as if it had been said,
   that those who love God's law shall continually prosper and retain
   their position, although the whole world should fall into ruins. But a
   different interpretation will be equally appropriate, namely, that they
   have great peace, because, being persuaded that both their persons and
   their life are acceptable to God, they calmly repose themselves on a
   good conscience. This tranquil state of conscience, this serenity of
   mind, is justly reckoned the chief point of a happy life, that is to
   say it is so, when it proceeds from God's being reconciled to us, and
   from his fatherly favor shining in our hearts. The Prophet justly
   teaches that we attain this peace from the love of the law; for whoever
   would make it to depend upon anything else, will be from time to time
   trembling at every little blast. If this sense is adopted, the word
   stumbling-block, in the second clause, will signify all the troubles
   and disquietudes of mind with which all who lean not upon God's word
   are miserably distressed and tormented, and with which they are driven
   about either by their own depraved passions, or by the caprice of other
   men. But in whatever way understand these two words, peace and
   stumbling-block, the design of the Prophet will remain the same, which
   is to show, that those who are not devoted to God are miserable; for
   although they may applaud themselves for a time, yet they will meet
   with many stumbling-blocks to drive them suddenly out of their course.
   From the term love, we gather that this peace is not acquired by a
   slavish observance of the law, but proceeds from faith; for the law has
   no sweetness to attract us to it, unless it exhibit to us God in the
   character of a father, and tranquilize our minds by the assurance of
   eternal salvation. So far from enjoying peace, all worldly men and
   despisers of God are justly punished by their own depravity and
   obdurate rebellion; for each of them is his own executioner, and the
   more fiercely they rage against the word of God, the sorer are they
   tormented, until they bring upon themselves utter destruction. The
   godly, it is true, are also tormented or distressed, but this inward
   consolation wipes away all their sorrow, or, raising them up, enables
   them to surmount all stumbling-blocks, or so relieves them, that they
   faint not.

   166 O Jehovah! I have waited for thy salvation. It is not without cause
   that the Prophet often repeats this sentence, which is in all men's
   mouths, there being nothing easier than to ascribe to God the praise
   and office of saving, while yet there is hardly to be met with in the
   world a single example of steadfast hope, when men come to wrestle with
   temptations for any length of time. From the order of the words we
   learn, that if a man would keep himself in the fear of God, and the
   love of the law, it is necessary for him, above all things, [36] to
   seek for salvation in God. If faith in God's grace be removed from our
   minds, or patience shaken off, we will be carried away hither and
   thither, and will cease any longer to cultivate godliness. The chief
   virtue of the faithful, therefore, is a patient endurance of the cross
   and mortification by which they calmly submit themselves to God; for so
   long as no adversity happens to hypocrites, they seem, also to be
   well-affectioned to the work of serving him. There are also other
   reasons why it behoves us to keep our minds intent upon the salvation
   of God, if we desire to regulate our life aright; for if the,
   allurements of the world hold us in their snares, we will immediately
   become discouraged. The reason, as we plainly see, why the hearts of
   the great majority fail, is because it is difficult to believe
   assuredly that salvation is to be hoped for only from the grace of God.
   That we may therefore persevere in serving God, it is indispensable
   that faith shine on the future before us, and next, that patience
   accompany us, to nourish within us the love of righteousness. For, as
   we have said, our alacrity in persevering proceeds from this, that with
   a patient spirit we suffer our salvation to lie hidden in the bosom of
   God, and that we doubt not of his at length, proving a faithful
   rewarder of all such as seek him, although he may withdraw his favor
   from the eye of sense. In the subsequent verse the Psalmist confirms
   this doctrine by other words, saying, that he kept God's testimonies
   with his soul By the word soul he expresses still more forcibly than
   before, that he had the doctrine of the law enclosed within the deepest
   recesses of his heart. The cause of this peculiarly diligent keeping of
   the law, was the singular love which he had to it, as he states in the
   concluding clause of the verse. He who by constraint and in a slavish
   manner obeys the law, is so far from receiving it into the secret
   habitation of his heart to keep it there, that he would have it removed
   far away from him.

   168. I have kept thy commandments and thy testimonies. What the
   Psalmist had expressed more strongly, he now repeats more simply,
   adding there to reason. He abbreviates the statement as made in the
   preceding verse only by here omitting the word soul, which he there
   uses, whilst to commandments he joins testimonies, in order the more
   distinctly to show that he does not speak exclusively of the rule of an
   upright and holy life, but also comprehends the whole covenant of
   salvation. And, assuredly, the doctrine of the law could not be so
   sweet and attractive from its commanding what is right, did it not at
   the same time exhibit the free favor of God. The reason which the
   Prophet assigns for his keeping God's commandments and testimonies --
   for all my ways are before thee [37] -- is to this effect, That the
   truth, which he well knew, that nothing is hidden from God, served as a
   bridle to keep him devoted to the cultivation of godliness; for if we
   live not as under the omniscient inspection of God, the fickle
   lustfulness of the flesh quickly carries us away now one way and now
   another. The meaning, also, may be this -- that he made God the arbiter
   and judge of his life; for in Scripture language those are said to walk
   before God, who refer all their actions to him, and, as it were,
   withdrawing themselves from the sight of men, present themselves at his
   judgment-seat. In this way he gives us to understand that he had
   endeavored not only to be free from all fault and blame before men, but
   also to offer to God a sound and sincere heart. Whichever of these
   senses is adopted, he testifies that it is only when we consider that
   we have to deal with God, who searcheth the heart, and from whose eyes
   nothing is hidden, that we will observe his law aright. This concluding
   clause may also be a form of protestation; as if the Prophet had said,
   Lord, thou art the best witness of the fidelity with which I have kept
   thy law, for nothing is hidden from thee. But he seems rather to have
   intended to intimate that the principle of his holy living, was his
   having consecrated his life to God, and having kept his thoughts fixed
   on the diverse presence.

   literally, observing, that the devout Hebrews were accustomed to praise
   God twice in the morning before reading the ten commandments, and once
   after; twice in the evening before reading the same portion of
   inspiration, and twice after; which makes up the number of seven times

   Psalm 119:169-174

   169. t Let my cry come near b, to thy presence, O Jehovah! Give me
   understanding according to thy word. 170. t Let my prayer come into thy
   presence: deliver me according to thy word. 171. t My lips shall speak
   praise, when thou shalt have taught me thy statutes. 172. t My tongue
   shall speak of thy word; for all thy commandments are righteousness.
   173. t Let thy hand be to succor me; for I have chosen thy
   commandments. 174. t I have longed for thy salvation, O Jehovah and thy
   law has been my delight. 175. t Let my soul live, and let it praise
   thee; and let thy judgments succor me. 176. t I have wandered like a
   lost sheep: seek thy servant, for I have not forgotten thy statutes.


   169. Let my cry come [38] near into thy presence. The Psalmist repeats
   the same sentiment which has already come under our notice -- that his
   chief desire, and what he, most of all pressed after, regarding
   everything else as of secondary importance, was to make progress in the
   study of the divine law. By the word cry he denotes earnestness. I am
   anxious, as if he had said, above all things, and am chiefly inflamed
   with this desire, (even as it is just and reasonable,) that the light
   of understanding by which we excel the lower animals, and approach very
   near to God, may be preferred by me to all earthly advantages. The
   expression, according to thy word, may be understood in two ways. It
   may denote that David besought God to impart to him understanding
   according to his promise; or, as some explain it, it may intimate that
   he desired to have his mind framed according to the rule of God's word,
   so that he might not be wise otherwise than according to the doctrine
   of the law. This last sense would not be inappropriate, did not these
   words in the following verse, Deliver me according to thy word, present
   an objection to such an interpretation. Having no doubt that these two
   sentences have a corresponding meaning -- though at first sight it is
   more specious to understand David as praying to be made wise according
   to the rule of the law -- I rather incline to the other sense, That he
   beseeches God to endue him with understanding, in fulfillment of his
   promise. And whilst God liberally promises all blessings to his people,
   to enlighten them by his Spirit, that they may excel in true and sound
   wisdom, is justly entitled to be ranked among the chief of his
   promises. This doctrine is profitable to us in many ways. In the first
   place we are taught that nothing is more to be desired than to have God
   guiding us by his light, that we may not be like brute beasts. In the
   second place we are taught that this is the peculiar gift of the Holy
   Spirit; for it would have been in vain for David to have besought. God
   to bestow upon him that which he had naturally in himself, or which he
   might have attained by his own painstaking. In the third place, what I
   have said concerning the promise is to be attended to, to the end the
   faithful may not hesitate to offer themselves to God to be enlightened
   by Him, who declares that he will be the guide of the blind, and who
   refuses not to be a master and teacher of little ones and of the
   humble.

   170. Let my prayer come into thy presence. After having made
   supplication that the gift of right understanding might be imparted to
   him, the Psalmist now implores God for deliverance, by which he
   acknowledges that he was continually involved in multiplied dangers
   from which he found it impossible to escape, unless God stretched forth
   his hand from heaven to his aid. We know, indeed, that whenever any
   distress was pressing hard behind him, he called upon God for succor;
   but as he does not here specify any particular distress, I have no
   doubt that, in commending his life in general terms to the protection
   of God, he thought again and again how he was shut up on every side by
   innumerable deaths, from which he could not escape if God did not prove
   his continual deliverer. But this is an inestimable comfort to us, that
   God assures us that in all dangers he will be ready and prepared to
   help us.

   171. My lips shall speak praise. David now shows in another way than in
   the preceding verse, how high a privilege he accounted it to be
   admitted by God among the number of His disciples, and to profit aright
   in His school, by declaring that, if so privileged, he will hasten
   forward to render thanks to him with fluent tongue. The word nv, naba,
   which he employs, is a metaphor taken from the bubbling up of
   fountains, and accordingly it signifies not simply to speak, but to
   pour forth speech copiously. As therefore he a little before showed the
   earnestness of his desire by praying, so now he affirms that his
   rejoicing will bear testimony that he desires nothing more than to be
   thoroughly imbued with heavenly truth. He again confirms the doctrine,
   That the way by which we become truly wise is, first by submitting
   ourselves to the Word of God, and not following our own imaginations;
   and, secondly, by God's opening our understanding and subduing it to
   the obedience of his will. He here joins together both these truths --
   namely, that when God has set before us His law, from which we are to
   learn what, ever is profitable for our welfare, He, at the same time,
   teaches us inwardly. It were not enough to have our ears stricken with
   the outward sound, did not God illuminate our minds by the Spirit of
   understanding, and correct our obduracy by the Spirit of docility. As
   the labor of teachers is to no purpose until virtue and efficacy has
   been given to it, so it is also to be noticed that such as are truly
   taught of God, are not led away from the law and the Scriptures by
   secret revelations, like some fanatics, who think that they linger
   still at their A B C, unless disdainfully trampling under foot the Word
   of God, they fly away after their own foolish fancies.

   172. My tongue shall speak of thy word. Here the Psalmist says, that
   when he shall have profited in God's law he will also employ himself in
   teaching it to others. This order is undoubtedly to be observed, That
   divine truth take root in our hearts before we engage in the work of
   teaching it to others. Yet every man, according to the measure of his
   faith, ought to communicate to his brethren what he has received, that
   the doctrine, whose use and fruit God would have to be displayed for
   the common edification of the Church, may not be buried. There is added
   the reason which ought to stir up all the godly to declare the law of
   God -- namely, because by this means righteousness is spread abroad
   through the whole world. When the Prophet honors the commandments of
   God with the title of righteousness, he does not simply express his
   approbation of them, but he indirectly shows, that, until this rule
   bear sway in governing mankind, the whole world is one scene of sad and
   horrible confusion. Yet, let my readers judge whether the word answer
   or witness, which the Hebrew verb nh, anah, properly signifies, is not
   more suitable in this place than speak; bringing out this sense -- "My
   tongue shall bear witness or answer to thy word; because the true
   knowledge of righteousness is to be sought only in the word;" but in
   that case, it will be necessary to supply the letter l, lamed, in the
   word 'mrtk, imrathecha, that it may read -- to thy word.

   173. Let thy hand be to succor me. As he had devoted himself to the
   doctrine of the law, David requests that the hand of God may be
   stretched forth for his aid. Farther, by these words he declares, that
   those who yield themselves to God to be governed by His word have
   continually need of His help. The more sincerely any individual studies
   to be a good man, so much the more numerous are the ways in which Satan
   troubles him, and so much the more are the enemies multiplied who
   molest him on all sides. But when God sees those who once embraced the
   truth of his word remaining steadfast in their resolution, he is so
   much the more inclined to aid them. By the word choose in the second
   clause, the Psalmist has expressed that nothing had hindered him from
   devoting himself to the law of God. No man will apply this mind to the
   love of the law without a great struggle, since the thoughts of every
   man are drawn away to a variety of objects, by the depraved affections
   of the flesh. This choosing then spoken of shows that it is not through
   ignorance or an inconsiderate zeal that the children of God desire
   above all things heavenly doctrine; but as they partake of the
   flexibility or pliancy of mind common to men, and feel the various
   impulses of the flesh, they purposely subdue their minds to the
   obedience of God.

   174. I have longed for thy salvation, O Jehovah! Although all men
   desire to be in happy circumstances, and no man avowedly repudiates
   God's favor; yet so confused and uncertain are the ideas which they
   entertain of that in which a life of happiness or propriety consists,
   that very few are to be found directing their aspirations to God. Some
   are carried away by their own ambition, some are wholly possessed with
   avarice, and others burn with lust, all imagining, that the farther
   they recede from God, everything will prosper so much the better with
   them. In short, in proportion as each man is desirous to be safe, in
   the same proportion does he provoke the anger of God, by seeking the
   means of his safety in all directions. The construction in the Hebrew
   text denotes steadfastness, or constancy of desire; for literally it
   is, that He Had longed for the salvation of God, and not that he only
   at the present time began to long for it. He next expresses the manner
   in which we are patiently to long for salvation; which is, by seeking
   consolation and relief in all our calamities from the word of God; for
   whoever does not comfort himself by a reliance on the grace promised in
   the word, will quail at the slightest assault made upon him. The
   Prophet then wisely kept his thoughts close upon the divine word, that
   he might not be turned away from hoping for the salvation of God.

   175. Let my soul live and let it praise thee. As the verbs are in the
   future tense, shall live, shall praise, this sentence may be expounded
   thus: Lord, when thou shalt have bestowed life upon me, I will
   endeavor, by celebrating thy praises, to show that I am not ungrateful.
   If this sense is approved, the sentence will be a kind of rejoicing, in
   which the Prophet, depending upon the divine promises, confidently
   proclaims, that his life will continue in safety. And, certainly,
   although our life is hidden under the shadow of death, we may,
   nevertheless, boast that it is safe, because God is its faithful
   guardian; and this assured confidence proceeds from his quickening
   grace, which is offered to us in his word. Yet, as the majority of
   Commentators translate these words in the optative mood, let us follow
   the more generally received interpretation, which is, that David in
   asking to have his life prolonged, shows, at the same time, that the
   end for which he desired to live was, that he might exercise himself in
   singing the praises of God, even as it is said in Psalm 115:18, "We who
   shall remain in life shall praise Jehovah." In the second clause it
   would be harsh to understand the word judgments of the commandments, to
   which it does not properly belong to give help. It seems then, that the
   Prophet, perceiving himself liable to numberless calamities -- even as
   the faithful, by reason of the unbridled license of the wicked, dwell
   in this world as sheep among wolves, -- calls upon God to protect him
   in the way of restraining, by his secret providence, the wicked from
   doing him harm. It is a very profitable doctrine, when things in the
   world are in a state of great confusion, and when our safety is in
   danger amidst so many and varied storms, to lift up our eyes to the
   judgments of God, and to seek a remedy in them. As, however, in this
   Psalm the word judgments is commonly referred to God's commandments, we
   may also fitly interpret it of them in this place, so that the Prophet
   attributes to the word of God the office and charge of giving succor;
   for God does not feed us with delusive promises, but, whenever an
   emergency arises, confirms and ratifies his word by giving some
   palpable manifestation of the operation of his hand. Thus, when the
   Prophet calls the divine law to his help, he pronounces a singular
   encomium upon the efficacy of the divine word. If any would prefer
   expounding the sentence of the keeping of the law, I offer no
   objections. In this sense it is as if the Prophet had said, -- O Lord,
   let the uprightness which I have practiced, and the zeal with which I
   have employed myself in keeping thy commandments, be a defense to me.

   176. I have wandered like a lost sheep. He is not to be understood as
   here confessing his sins, -- an opinion erroneously held by many, -- as
   if he had been drawn into the trails of Satan; for this is inconsistent
   with the second clause, in which he denies that he had forgotten God's
   law. It is a poor solution of this difficulty to say, that:, previous
   to the time of his calling, he was a wandering sheep, but that from the
   time of his calling he was devoted to godliness -- or that in straying
   he was withheld by some godly affection from utterly casting off the
   fear of God; for the same time is undoubtedly referred to in both
   clauses. Again it is easy to gather, that the two clauses of this verse
   ought to be connected together by although, or notwithstanding, or some
   other such particle, as the Latins call adversative, [39] as if the
   Prophet had said, Although I have wandered about like a lost sheep, yet
   I have not forgotten the law of God. His meaning, I conceive, is, that
   he wandered, because, being chased by the force and violence of his
   enemies, he transported himself from place to place in great fear, in
   quest of retreats in which he might hide himself. We know for certain,
   that David was so hunted that in his exile he could nowhere find a
   secure place. This similitude would therefore very properly apply to
   him, because, although driven away and hunted after by his persecutors,
   he yet never turned aside from the law of God. Moreover, as the wolves
   pursued him everywhere, he prays God to bring him back and give him a
   place of safety and tranquillity, that he may at length cease from any
   longer wandering hither and thither, and being as a vagabond. [40] He
   had a very good ground for believing that he would be heard in the
   fact, that although provoked by manifold wrongs he yet never swerved
   from the fear of God -- a statement which, however, ought to be
   referred rather to the general course of his life than to particular
   acts. Although when he fell into adultery he continued for a time in a
   state of insensibility, yet it cannot be denied that in his adversities
   he was restrained by a holy patience, so as to persevere in following
   after righteousness. [41]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [38] As has been observed by some critics, the Psalmist's cry for
   deliverance is here personified. He represents it as if an intelligent
   being, and as sent up by him to heaven, there to plead his cause in the
   presence of God. The same elegant poetical figure is used in the
   following verse, and it is of frequent occurrence in the Book of
   Psalms.

   [39] "En apres, il est facile de recueillir, que les deux membres de ce
   propos se doyvent lier ensemble par Combien, ou Ja soit, ou quelque
   autre telle partieule que les Latins appellent adversative." -- Fr.

   [40] "A ce qu'a la fin il cesse de plus tracasser ca et la et estre
   comme vagabond." -- Fr.

   [41] Before leaving this divine poem, to the close of which we halve
   now arrived, there are a few remarks which may be suggested upon a
   review of the whole. In the first place, it is worthy of observation,
   that its alphabetical structure has been so completely preserved, that
   not one of the initial letters in it has been lost, notwithstanding its
   length and great antiquity, being older by many ages than any of the
   celebrated writings of Greece and Rome. In the second place, the
   wonderful perfection and yet connection of its various parts is also
   deserving of attention. Wherever we begin we seem to be at the
   commencement, and wherever we stop the sense is complete; and yet the
   poem does not consist of detached sentences, but is a whole consisting
   of many parts, all of which seem necessary to its perfection. In the
   third place, the numerous apparent repetitions which occur in it ought
   not to excite the prejudice of the reader. Although the frequent
   recurrence of the same words may not have an effect altogether
   agreeable upon fastidious ears, yet these words are so connected with
   others, as to bring out new meanings and to suggest new trains of
   thought. Hence the intelligent and pious student, instead of finding
   the sentences tautological, will discover new sentiments welling out to
   preserve his attention and to keep alive the flame of devotion.
   Walford, after observing that some readers may think this poem
   singularly marked by frequent repetitions, adds -- "It is not my
   intention to write an essay on this theme; and I shall therefore
   briefly say, that the implicitly of ancient writings is one of their
   greatest charms. If the repetitions of Psalm 119 create in it a
   blemish, it is one which the royal author of it shares in common with
   the most illustrious poet of Pagan antiquity; and that if simplicity
   and repetition are to be objected against David's Ode, the author of
   the Iliad and the Odyssey will hardly escape condemnation." In fine,
   the attentive reader must have observed the striking manner in which
   this composition exhibits the workings of genuine godliness in the
   regenerated soul. "I know of no part of the Holy Scriptures," remarks
   that eminent man, Jonathan Edwards, "where the nature and evidences of
   true and sincere godliness are so fully and largely insisted on and
   delineated as in Psalm 119. The Psalmist declares his design in the
   first verses of the Psalm, keeps his eye on it all along, and pursues
   it to the end. The excellency of holiness is represented as the
   immediate object of a spiritual taste and delight. God's law -- that
   grand expression and emanation of the holiness of God's nature and
   prescription of holiness to the creature -- is all along represented as
   the great object of the love, the complacence, and the rejoicing of the
   gracious nature, which prizes God's commands above gold, yea, the
   finest gold,' and to which they are sweeter than honey and the
   honey-comb.'" -- Edwards on the Religious Affections, part 3 section 3.

   PSALM 120.

   A Song of Degrees.

   If we suppose David to have been the author of this Psalm, as is very
   probable, he declares how diligently he engaged in prayer, when, to
   escape the cruelty of Saul, he wandered as an exile from place to
   place. But he especially complains of wicked informers, who unjustly
   and calumniously charged him with crimes of which he was altogether
   innocent. If a different supposition is preferred, the language will be
   a simple and general complaint against false reports. This Psalm, and
   the immediately subsequent fourteen, are called Psalms of Degrees; but
   for what reason is not agreed upon, even among the Hebrew doctors. Some
   conceive that there were fifteen steps to that part of the Temple which
   was allotted for the men, whereas the women remained beneath [42] but
   this is a silly conjecture, for which there is no foundation; and we
   know the liberties which the Jews, in obscure and uncertain matters
   like this, take of giving forth as an explanation whatever comes into
   their own fancy. Some translate Psalms of Ascents; and by ascent they
   understand the return of the Jews from the Babylonish captivity [43] --
   an interpretation which is altogether forced; for it is manifest that
   the greater part of these Psalms were composed, either by David or
   Solomon; and it is easy to gather from their contents, that such of
   them as were written by David, were, sung in the Temple, while he was
   alive and on the throne. Others think that the word ascents refers to
   the tones of music [44] Some also affirm that it was the beginning of a
   song. This being a matter of small moment, I am not disposed to make it
   the subject of elaborate investigation; but the probable conjecture is,
   that this title was given to these Psalms, because they were sung on a
   higher key than others. The Hebrew word for degrees being derived from
   the verb tslh, tsalah, to ascend or go up, I agree with those who are
   of opinion that it denotes the different musical notes rising in
   succession. [45]

   Psalm 120:1-4

   1. I cried [46] to Jehovah in my distress, and he answered me. 2. O
   Jehovah! deliver my soul from the lips [47] of falsehood, and from the
   tongue of deceit. [48] 3. What shall the tongue of deceit [49] give
   thee, and what shall avail thee? 4. The arrows of a strong man
   sharpened, with coals of junipers.


   1. I cried to Jehovah in my distress. The name of the author of the
   Psalm is not expressed, but the style of it throughout presents David
   to our view. Although, therefore, I cannot positively affirm, yet I am
   rather inclined to think that it was composed by him. Nor will it be
   improper, in my judgment, to explain it as if his name had been
   mentioned in the inscription. This, then, being granted, I would
   observe that although David, when in this verse he affirms that the
   Lord had heard him, gives thanks to him, yet his chief purpose was to
   set forth, in the form of complaint, how wickedly and cruelly Saul's
   flatterers employed all their ingenuity and power to accomplish his
   destruction. He, however, sets out with an expression of his gratitude
   to God, telling us that he had not called upon Him in vain; and he does
   this, that by his own example he might encourage others, especially
   when oppressed with adversity, to confidence in prayer. Men, it is
   true, have need of God's help every moment; but there is not a more
   suitable season for seeking him than when some great danger is
   immediately menacing us. It is therefore worthy of notice, that he was
   heard when, constrained and shut up by tribulation, he betook himself
   to the protection of God.

   2. O Jehovah! deliver my soul from the lip of falsehood. David now
   points out the kind of his affliction, declaring that he was loaded
   with false accusations. In charging his enemies with lying and
   falsehood, he asserts his own innocence of the crimes which they
   slanderously imputed to him. His complaint therefore amounts to this,
   that as he was conscious of having committed no fault, he was assaulted
   by the wicked contrary to all law, human and divine, and that they
   brought him into hatred without his having given them any occasion for
   such injurious treatment. Deceitful tongues assault good and simple
   people in two ways' they either circumvent them by wiles and snares, or
   wound their reputation by calumnies. It is of the second way that the
   Prophet here complains. Now if David, who was endued with such eminent
   virtue, and free from every mark of disgrace, and far removed from
   every wicked action, was yet assailed with contumely, is it to be
   wondered at if the children of God in the present day labor under false
   accusations, and that when they have endeavored to conduct themselves
   uprightly they are yet in reported of? As they have the devil for their
   enemy, it is indeed impossible for them to escape being loaded with his
   lies. Yea, we see that slanderous tongues did not spare even the Son of
   God -- a consideration which should induce us to bear the more
   patiently our condition, when the wicked traduce us undeservedly; since
   it is certain that we have here described the common lot of the whole
   Church.

   3. What shall the tongue of deceit give thee? [50] The Prophet
   aggravates the malice of his enemies by asserting that they were so
   wickedly inclined as to be driven to evil speaking when they saw no
   prospect of deriving any advantage from such a course of conduct. He
   however seems to express more than this, -- he seems farther to
   intimate, that after they have poured forth all the venom of their
   calumnies, their attempts will nevertheless be vain and ineffectual. As
   God is the maintainer of the innocence of his servants, David, inspired
   with hope from this truth, rises up against them with heroic courage,
   as if about to triumph over the whole crowd of his calumniators, [51]
   reproaching them for doing nothing else than betraying an impotent
   passion for evil speaking, which God at length would cause to recoil
   upon their own heads. It is a consideration well fitted to assuage the
   grief of all the godly, when their good name is unrighteously wounded
   by calumniators, that such malicious characters will gain nothing
   thereby in the end, because God will disappoint their expectation.

   4. The arrows of a strong man sharpened, with coals of juniper. Here
   the Psalmist amplifies in another way the malice of such as distress
   the simple and innocent by their calumnies, affirming that they throw
   out their injurious reports just like a man who should draw an arrow,
   and with it pierce through the body of his neighbor; and that their
   calumnies were like coals of juniper, [52] which penetrate more
   effectually, and burn more intensely the substances with which they
   come in contact than the coals of any other kind of wood. The amount
   is, that the tongues of these slanderers were inflamed with the burning
   heat of fire, and, as it were, dipped in deadly poison; and that such
   persons were the less excusable, from the fact that, without deriving
   any advantage from it, they were impelled by an unbridled passion to
   inflict upon others deadly mischief. As the Prophet records nothing
   here which he did not experience in his own person, it may be inferred
   that if it behoved him and men of a similar character to be assailed by
   their enemies with lies, which were to them as arrows to pierce them,
   or coals to burn them, we need not be surprised at seeing the most
   eminent servants of God exercised with similar assaults.

   [46] "qr'ty, I have called constantly, attentively, and anxiously, not
   with violent external gesture, or elevation of voice, but with strong
   inward emotion " -- Phillips.

   [47] "Des leures." -- Fr. "From the lips." But in the Hebrew text it is
   in the singular," from a lip of falsehood," that is, "from a false
   lip."

   [48] "lsvn rmyh, the deceitful tongue. We have here two norms, both of
   which are in the absolute state, so that we must suppose the latter to
   be put emphatically for an abjective, the force of the expression being
   the same as that of lsvn rmyh, tongue of deceit, i.e., deceitful
   tongue, a more frequent construction. So also we have spht sqr, lip of
   falsehood, for false lip, in the first member of this verse. The
   literal rendering of the words lsvn rmyh, is tongue, (which is) deceit
   itself." -- Phillips.

   [49] "La langue pleine de fraude." -- Fr. "The tongue full of deceit."

   [50] The Psalmist here addresses himself in particular to his
   traducers.

   [51] "Comme s'il avoit desia le triomphe contre toute la bande de scs
   ennemis." -- Fr. "As if he had already triumphed over the whole host of
   his enemies."

   [52] The Hebrew word rtm, rothem, here rendered "juniper," occurs also
   in I Kings 19:4, 5, and Job 30:4, in both which places it is translated
   in our English Bible by "juniper-tree." It would appear that this shrub
   was remarkable for the intense flame with which it burned, and for the
   length of time during which its embers retained their heat. Several
   critics, however, think that the Hebrew rothem means the genista or
   Spanish broom; and in support of this opinion it is said that the
   genista is much used as fuel by the Arabs, among whom the Psalmist
   describes himself as then living; and that, as Geierus asserts, it"
   sparkles, burns, and crackles more vehemently than any other wood."
   (See Parkhurst on rtm.) It is somewhat difficult to decide in this
   matter. As more than thirty different trees are mentioned in the Bible,
   and as we are but imperfectly acquainted with the natural history of
   these remote countries, it is no wonder though we find it impossible to
   identify all these trees. It may be observed that Calvin in his
   translation brings out that beautiful gradation of sense, terminating
   in a point of severity, for which the Hebrew text is remarkable, but
   which does not appear in our English version. Slanderous words are
   first compared to "arrows," secondly, to "arrows discharged from the
   bow by a strong man," and in proportion to the strength of a man will
   be the force with which his weapon strikes; next to "sharp arrows;" and
   lastly, to "coals of juniper," or some wood used in those days
   celebrated for burning fiercely and long, (for the particle m, im
   translated with, is sometimes one of similitude, as in Psalm 106:6, "We
   have sinned like as our fathers,") intimating not only that malignant
   slanders deeply penetrate, but that they inflame and burn for a long
   time. Hence the Apostle James (James 3:5, 6) compares the tongue of
   slander to a fire enkindled from hell, and inflaming the course of
   nature. Some interpreters think that this verse is not to be understood
   as a description of calumny, but rather as the punishment which God
   will inflict on the calumniator. They therefore regard it as an answer
   to the question in the preceding verse, "What shall be given unto
   thee," etc.; observing that calumny and falsehood being frequently
   represented by the images of arrows and fire, the same images suitably
   express the requital which awaits them at the hand of God -- the swift
   and terrible retributive vengeance of the Almighty, which will overtake
   all who practice falsehood and slander. See Psalm 57:4; Psalm 64:3, 7,
   9; and Job 20:26. "Sharp arrows of the Mighty One, with coals of
   juniper," await them. This opinion is adopted by Street, Mant, Morison,
   Paxton, Fry, French and Skinner. Calvin's exposition is embraced by
   Walford and Phillips. The former, to elicit this meaning the more
   clearly, uses a supplement: "Sharp arrows of a warrior,
   And burning coals of juniper, thou resemblest." He, however, in a
   footnote requests the reader "to observe, that this is given as what
   seems to be the most probable interpretation of the passage, though it
   cannot be regarded as absolutely certain."

   Psalm 120:5-7

   5. Alas for me! that I have been a sojourner [53] in Mesech, and have
   dwelt among the tents of Kedar. 6. My soul hath long dwelt with him who
   hateth peace. 7. I am for peace; and when I speak they are for war.
   [54]


   5. Alas for me! that I have been a sojourner in Mesech. David complains
   that he was doomed to linger for a long time among a perverse people;
   his condition resembling that of some wretched individual who is
   compelled to live till he grows old in sorrowful exile. The Mesechites
   and Kedarenes, as is well known, were Eastern tribes; the former of
   which derived their original from Japhet, as Moses informs us in
   Genesis 10:2; and the latter from a son of Ishmael. (Genesis 25:13.) To
   take the latter for a people of Italy, who were anciently called
   Hetrurians, is altogether absurd, and without the least color of
   probability, Some would have the word Mesech to be an appellative noun;
   and because ms mashak, signifies to draw, to protract, they think that
   the Prophet bewails his protracted banishment, of the termination of
   which he saw no prospect. [55] But as immediately after he adds Kedar,
   by which term the Ishmaelites are unquestionably intended, I have no
   doubt that Mesech is to be understood of the Arabians who were their
   neighbors. If any one is of opinion that the Mesechites obtained this
   name from their dexterity in shooting with the bow, I will make no
   objections, provided it is admitted that the Prophet -- as if he had
   been confined within a country of robbers -- expresses the irksomeness
   of an uncomfortable and an annoying place of residence. Although he
   names the Arabians, yet under the terms employed he speaks
   metaphorically of his own countrymen, just as he elsewhere applies the
   appellation of Gentiles to the corrupt and degenerate Jews. [56] But
   here, with the view of putting still more dishonor upon his enemies, he
   has purposely selected the name by which to designate them from some of
   the savage and barbarous nations whose horrible cruelty was well known
   to the Jews. From these words we are taught, that scarcely a more
   distressing evil can befall the people of God, than for them to be
   placed in circumstances which, notwithstanding their living a holy and
   an inoffensive life, they yet cannot escape the calumnies of venomous
   tongues. It is to be observed, that although David was living in his
   own country, he yet was a stranger in it, nothing being more grievous
   to him than to be in the company of wicked men. Hence we learn that no
   sin is more detestable to God, by whose Spirit David spake, than the
   false accusations which shamefully deface the beauty of God's Church,
   and lay it waste, causing it to differ little from the dens of robbers,
   or other places rendered infamous from the barbarous cruelty of which
   they are the scene. Now if the place where the uprightness of good men
   is overwhelmed by the criminations of lying lips is to the children of
   God converted into a region of miserable exile, how could they have
   pleasure, or rather, how could they fail to feel the bitterest sorrow,
   in abiding in a part of the world where the sacred name of God is
   shamefully profaned by horrible blasphemies, and his truth obscured by
   detestable lies? David exclaims, Alas for me! because, dwelling among
   false brethren and a bastard race of Abraham, he was wrongfully
   molested and tormented by them, although he had behaved himself towards
   them in good conscience. [57] Since, then, at the present day, in the
   Church of Rome, religion is dishonored by all manner of disgraceful
   imputations, faith torn in pieces, light turned into darkness, and the
   majesty of God exposed to the grossest mockeries, it will certainly be
   impossible for those who have any feeling of true piety within them to
   lie in the midst of such pollutions without great anguish of spirit.

   6. My soul [58] hath long dwelt with him who hateth peace. The Psalmist
   now shows, without figure, and, so to speak, points with the finger to
   those [59] whom he had before indirectly marked out by the terms Mesech
   and kedar, namely, the perfidious Israelites, who had degenerated from
   the holy fathers, and who rather wore the mask of Israelites than were
   the true seed of Israel. [60] He calls them haters of peace, [61]
   because they wilfully, and with deliberate malice, set themselves to
   make war upon the good and unoffending. To the same purpose he adds
   immediately after, that his heart was strongly inclined to seek after
   peace, or rather, that he was wholly devoted to it, and had tried every
   means in order to win their favor, but that the implacable cruelty of
   their disposition invariably impelled them to do him mischief. When he
   says, I peace, it is an abrupt, yet not an obscure expression, implying
   that he had not done them any injury or wrong which could give occasion
   for their hatred there having been always peace on his part. He even
   proceeds farther, asserting, that when he saw them inflamed with
   resentment against him, he endcavourcd to pacify them, and to bring
   them to a good understanding; for to speak, is here equivalent to
   offering conditions of peace in an amicable spirit, or to treating of
   reconciliation. From this it is still more apparent, how savage and
   brutal was the pride of David's enemies, since they disdained even to
   speak with him -- to speak with a man who had deserved well at their
   hands, and who had never in any respect injured them. We are taught by
   his example, that it is not enough for the faithful to abstain from
   hurting others: they must, moreover, study to allure them by
   gentleness, and to bend them to good will. Should their moderation and
   kindness be rejected, let them wait in patience, until God at length
   show himself from heaven as their protector. Let us, however, remember,
   that if God does not immediately stretch forth his hand in our behalf,
   it is our duty to bear the wearisomeness occasioned by delay, like
   David, whom we find in this Psalm giving, thanks to God for his
   deliverance, while, at the same time, as if worn out with the weariness
   of waiting for it, he bewails the long oppression to which he had been
   subjected by his enemies.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [53] "C'est, en exile;" --"That is, in exile." -- Fr-. Marg.

   [54] Literally it is, "I peace; and when I speak, they for war."

   [55] This is the sense in which the word is rendered in most of the
   ancient versions. Thus the Septuagint has he paroikia mru emakrunthe,
   "my sojourning is protracted;" and it is followed by the Syriac,
   Vulgate, and Arabic versions. Aquila has proseluteusa en makrusmo I was
   a stranger for a long time;" and Symmachus, paroikon parilkusa "I have
   protracted sojourning." Bishop Patrick and Dr. Hammond, following these
   authorities, render msk, mesech, adverbially. But though this is a
   meaning which the word will bear, yet as Calvin observes, there is
   little room for doubting that it is here a proper name. The parallelism
   which enables us in many instances to determine the accurate
   interpretation of a word in Hebrew poetry when other helps entirely
   fail, decidedly favors this interpretation. The term corresponding to
   msk mesech, in the next hemistich, is qrr kedar; and as it is
   universally admitted that this is the name of a place, it cannot be
   justly questioned that such is also the case with respect to msk
   mesech. To render it otherwise is destructive of the poetical structure
   of the passage. "If," says Phillips, "the adverbial sense be intended,
   then the expression should not have been grty msk, but something
   analogous to rvt sknh in the next verse. Many localities have been
   mentioned for the geography of Mesech, as Tuscany, Cappadocia, Armenia,
   etc., which proves that the particular district called by this name is
   uncertain." It is however obvious that some barbarous and brutal tribes
   of Arabs are intended.

   [56] A similar mode of speaking is not uncommon in our own day. Thus we
   are accustomed to call gross and ignorant people Turks and Hottentots.

   [57] "D'autant que dcmeurant entre des faux freres et une race bastardc
   d'Abraham, a tort il est par eux molest4 et tourment( cornroe ainsi
   soit th'envers eux il se porte en bonne conscience." -- Fr.

   [58] My soul, for I.

   [59] "Et (par maniere de dire) monstre au doigt ceux," etc -- Fr.

   [60] "Aseavoir les Israelites desloyaux qui avoyent forligne' des
   saincts Peres, et qui estoyent plustost des masques d'Israclites, que
   non pas une vraye semence d'Israel." -- Fr.

   [61] In describing those among whom he was now living as haters of
   peace, and, in the next verse, as bent on war, the inspired writer
   probably still alludes to the Arab tribes he had specified in the 5th
   verse, who have, from their origin to the present hour, been eminently
   characterized by their hatred of peace and propensity to war. Dr. Shaw
   thus writes concerning these barbarous tribes as they are to be found
   in our own day, and their character and habits were the same at the
   time when this Psalm was written: "The Arabs are naturally thievish and
   treacherous; and it sometimes happens, that those very persons are
   overtaken and pillaged in the morning who were entertained the night
   before with all the instances of friendship and hospitality. Neither
   are they to be accused for plundering strangers only, and attacking
   almost every person whom they find unarmed and defenceless, but for
   those many implacable and hereditary animosities which continually
   subsist among them: literally fulfilling the prophecy to Hagar, that
   Ishmael should be a wild man; his hand should be against every man, and
   every man's hand against him.'"
     __________________________________________________________________

   [42] This opinion was held by Rabbi David Kimchi; and he asserts that
   the Psalms, entitled Songs of Ascents or Steps, were so entitled
   because the Levites sang one of them upon each of the fifteen steps,
   which, says he, separated the court of the women from that of the men
   in Solomon's Temple. This Calvin justly characterizes as a "silly
   conjecture;" and such an explanation is now generally rejected. Jebb,
   after stating several of the attempted solutions of the title of these
   Psalms, observes -- "On these notions it is unnecessary to dwell, and
   still less upon that Jewish fable mentioned by Rabbi David, that these
   Psalms were sung on ascending the fifteen steps, which were imagined to
   lead from one of the outer courts of the Temple to that of the Levites.
   No trace in history, or authentic tradition, can be found of these
   steps, which owe their construction solely to the accommodating fancy
   of the Rabbins, who, as usual, imagined facts, in order to support
   their preconceived theories." -- Jebb's Literal Translation of the
   Psalms, with Dissertations, volume 2. It is an additional objection to
   this Rabbinical conceit, that David, whose name several of these Psalms
   bear -- and others of which have evident reference to his time and
   circumstances -- lived in the time of the tabernacle, which had no
   steps.

   [43] The Syriac version calls them "Songs of Ascent out of Babylon;"
   and such is the interpretation of several modern critics, among whom is
   Calmet, who has given an able analysis of what has been written on this
   title in his Dissertation sur les quinze Psaumes Gradue After stating
   numerous explanations, and characterizing many of them as "vaines et
   frivoles conjectures," he adopts it as the most probable supposition,
   that they were sung during the journey of the returning captives from
   Babylon to Jerusalem.

   [44] This is the opinion of Aben Ezra.

   [45] While Calvin leans to this as the most probable explanation, he
   has before admitted that it is only a conjecture; and after all that
   has been said since his time on the subject, it is still involved in
   obscurity, and perhaps it is now impossible to arrive at a satisfactory
   conclusion. The Psalms, however, which bear this title, have a striking
   resemblance to each other, and are different in style from the other
   divine Poems in this book. They are all very short, and in several of
   them there is a gradation of meaning, and a degree of point towards the
   dose, which may be called epigrammatic. Hence Gesenius suggests that
   the title may mark a peculiar species of Hebrew composition. "The
   construction of the songs" [of degrees,] says Jebb, "is such as to
   reduce the evidently to a class. They are all short compositions,
   sententious, eminently fitted for lyrical use, in the highest degree
   poetical, and, as Calmet justly remarks, epigramrustic; using this term
   in its highest sense as concinnate, terse, and abounding in turns
   expressed with the most exquisite brevity. Two remarkable
   characteristics they possess, which, though found occasionally in other
   Psalms, seem to enter into the very texture of these -- I mean the
   frequent recurrence of a characteristic word, and that figure which the
   rhetoricians call Epanaphora, or the repetition of the same idea or
   expression. As to the characteristic words: In Psalm 121 this is the
   word keep (smr); in Psalm 122 the word Salem, and others of a like
   sound; in Psalm 123 the word eyes, yny, in Psalm 126 the words turn and
   captivity, which in Hebrew are almost the same, mrv and syvh in Psalm
   127 vain, sr'; in Psalm 133 the word descend, yrr; and bless, vrk in
   Psalm 134 " -- Jebb's Literal Translation of the Psalms, with
   Dissertations, volume 2.

   PSALM 121

   The Psalmist, to encourage true believers confidently to trust in the
   aid of God, and to teach them to betake themselves to his protection,
   first, affirms that, to whatever quarter we turn our eyes it is
   impossible to find salvation anywhere else; and, in the second place,
   extols in lofty terms the fatherly care of God in defending his
   faithful ones.

   Psalm 121:1-2

   1. I will lift up my eyes to the mountains, whence my help will come
   [62] 2. My help is from Jehovah, who made heaven and earth.


   l I will lift up my eyes to the mountains. The inspired writer, whoever
   he was, seems, in the opening of the Psalm, to speak in the person of
   an unbelieving man. As God prevents his believing people with his
   blessings, and meets them of his own accord, so they, on their part,
   immediately cast their eyes directly upon him. What then is the meaning
   of this unsettled looking of the Prophet, who casts his eyes now on
   this side and now on that, as if faith directed him not to God? I
   answer, that the thoughts of the godly are never so stayed upon the
   word of God as not to be carried away at the first impulse to some
   allurements; and especially when dangers disquiet us, or when we are
   assailed with sore temptations, it is scarcely possible for us, from
   our being so inclined to the earth, not to be moved by the enticements
   presented to us, until our minds put a bridle upon themselves, and turn
   them back to God. The sentence, however, may be explained as if
   expressed in a conditional form. Whatever we may think, would the
   Prophet say, all the hopes which draw us away from God are vain and
   delusive. If we take it in this sense, he is not to be understood as
   relating how he reasoned with himself, or what he intended to do, but
   only as declaring, that those lose their pains who, disregarding God,
   gaze to a distance all around them, and make long and devious circuits
   in quest of remedies to their troubles. It is indeed certain, that in
   thus speaking of himself, he exhibits to us a malady with which all
   mankind are afflicted; but still, it will not be unsuitable to suppose,
   that he was prompted to speak in this manner from his own experience;
   for such is the inconstancy natural to us, that so soon as we are
   smitten with any fear, we turn our eyes in every direction, until
   faith, drawing us back from all these erratic wanderings, direct us
   exclusively to God. All the difference between believers and
   unbelievers in this respect is, that although all are prone to be
   deceived, and easily cheated by impostures, yet Satan bewitches
   unbelievers by his enchantments; whereas, in regard to believers, God
   corrects the vice of their nature, and does not permit them to
   persevere in going astray. The meaning of the Prophet is abundantly
   obvious, which is, that although all the helps of the world, even the
   mightiest, should offer themselves to us, yet we ought not to seek
   safety anywhere but in God; yea, rather, that when men shall have long
   wearied themselves in hunting after remedies, now in one quarter and
   now in another, they will at length find from experience, that there is
   no assured help but in God alone. By the mountains, the Prophet means
   whatever is great or excellent in the world; and the lesson he teaches
   is, that we ought to account all such favor as nothing.

   Farther, these two verses ought to be read connectedly, bringing out
   this sense: When I shall have lifted up my eyes to the mountains, then
   I will at length experience that I have fallen into a rash and
   unprofitable mistake, until I direct them to God alone, and keep them
   fixed upon him. It is at the same time to be observed, that God in this
   place is not in vain honored with the title of Creator of heaven and
   earth; it being intended hereby tacitly to rebuke the ingratitude of
   men, when they cannot rest contented with his power. Did they in good
   earnest acknowledge him as Creator, they would also be persuaded, that
   as he holds the whole world in his hand, and governs it as seemeth good
   in his sight, he is possessed of infinite power. But when, hurried away
   by the blind impetuosity of their passions, they have recourse to other
   objects besides him, they defraud him of his right and empire. In this
   way ought we to apply this title of God to the case in hand. The amount
   is, that whilst we are naturally more anxious than is needful in
   seeking alleviation and redress to our calamities, especially when any
   imminent danger threatens us, yet we act a foolish and mistaken part in
   running up and down through tortuous mazes: and that therefore we ought
   to impose a restraint upon our understandings, that they may not apply
   themselves to any other but God alone. Nor is the opinion of those
   unsuitable, who think that the Hebrew word 'l, el, which we translate
   to, namely, to the mountains, is put for l, al, which signifies above,
   giving this sense, That men, however high they may look, will find no
   true salvation except in God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [62] Phillips, who thinks it "probable that that Psalm was written just
   as the Israelites were about to commence their journey to their native
   land," gives this explanation of the verse: "I will l lift up eyes to
   the mountains, viz., Zion, Tabor, Carmel, etc.; but especially to the
   first, as being the place of the ark, and consequently the place to
   which the Israelites directed their eyes, as to a fountain of all good.
   There they looked for help as often as circumstances rendered expected
   assistance requisite, as we learn from several passages in the Psalms.
   See Psalm 14:7; Psalm 20:3." In returning from Babylon, how many a
   longing and anxious look would the Jews cast to the hills of Palestine,
   and with how many stirring and sacred emotions would the sight of them
   fill their minds!
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 121:3-5

   3. He will not suffer thy foot to stumble: he who keepeth thee will not
   slumber. 4. Behold! he who keepeth Israel will not slumber nor sleep.
   5. Jehovah is thy keeper; Jehovah is thy defence [63] on thy right
   hand.


   3 He will not suffer thy foot to stumble. Here the Prophet, in order to
   recall the faithful to the right path, and to defeat the influence of
   all the allurements which are wont to distract their minds, affirms
   that whatever advantages worldly men are accustomed to desire or hope
   for from the world, true believers will find abundantly and at hand in
   God alone. He not only attributes power to God, but also teaches that
   He is so affectioned towards us, that he will preserve us in all
   respects in perfect safety. As often as the power of God is extolled,
   there are many who immediately reply, It is very true that he can do
   such and such things if he is so inclined, but we do not certainly know
   what is his intention. In this passage, therefore, God is exhibited to
   the faithful as their guardian, that they may rest with assured
   confidence on his providence. As the Epicureans, in imagining that God
   has no care whatever about the world, extinguish all piety, so those
   who think that the world is governed by God only in a general and
   confused manner, and believe not that he cherishes with special care
   each of his believing people, leave men's minds in suspense, and are
   themselves kept in a state of constant fluctuation and anxiety. In
   short, never will the hearts of men be led in good earnest to call upon
   God, until a persuasion of the truth of this guardianship is deeply
   fixed in their minds. The Psalmist declares that the purpose for which
   God is our keeper, is, that he may hold us up. The Hebrew word, mvt,
   mot, which is here used, signifies both a sliding or falling, and a
   trembling or staggering. Now, although it often happens that the
   faithful stagger, yea, are even ready to fall altogether, yet as God
   sustains them by his power, they are said to stand upright. And as
   amidst the many dangers which every moment threaten us, it is difficult
   for us to get rid of all anxiety and fear, the Prophet at the same time
   testifies, that God keeps watch unceasingly over our safety.

   4. Behold! he who keepeth Israel will not slumber nor sleep. [64] To
   recall each individual to the consideration of the common covenant, he
   represents the Divine providence as extending to the whole body of the
   Church. In order that each of us for himself may be assured that God
   will be gracious to him, it behoves us always to begin with the general
   promise made to all God's people,. This form of expression, he will not
   slumber nor sleep, would be improper in other languages, according to
   the idiom of which it should rather be, He will not sleep, yea, he will
   not slumber: but when the Hebrews invert this order, they argue from
   the greater to the less. The sense then is, that as God never slumbers
   even in the smallest degree, we need not be afraid of any harm
   befalling us while he is asleep. The design of the Prophet is now
   obvious. To persuade true believers that God has a special care of each
   of them in particular, he brings forward the promise which God made to
   the whole people, and declares God to be the guardian of his Church,
   that from this general principle, as from a fountain, each might convey
   streams to himself. Accordingly immediately after, (Psalm 121:5,)
   addressing himself to each in particular, he repeats, Jehovah is thy
   keeper, that no person might hesitate to apply to himself that which
   belonged to the whole community of Israel. Besides, God is called a
   defense at the right hand, to teach us that it is not necessary for us
   to go far in seeking him, but that he is at hand, or rather stands at
   our side to defend us.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [63] The Hebrew word is tsl, tsel, "a shadow;" and hence it has been
   supposed that the words, "thy shadow at thy right hand.," are a
   figurative expression, referring to the protection afforded by the
   shade of a tree against the scorching rays of the sun, or to the custom
   which prevails in tropical climates especially, of keeping off the
   intense heat of the sun by a portable screen, such as an umbrella or
   parasol. The word is often put for defense in general. Compare Numbers
   14:9; Isaiah 30:2; Jeremiah 48:45

   [64] A notion was prevalent among the heathen, that their gods
   sometimes slept, and were not then conscious of the wants of their
   worshippers. Elijah thus addressed in irony the followers of Baal, 1
   Kings 18:27: "Cry aloud; for he is a god; either he is talking, or he
   is pursuing,
   or he is in a journey, or peradventure he sleepeth,
   and must be waked." Very different was the character of the guardian of
   Israel. He relaxed not his watchful care over his people by indulging
   in light slumbers during the day, nor even by sleeping in the night,
   when the tired frame of man seeks and demands repose.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 121:6-8

   6. The sun shall not smite thee by day, nor the moon by night. [65] 7.
   Jehovah shall keep thee from all evil; he will keep thy soul. 8.
   Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy coming in, henceforth and for
   ever.


   6. The sun shall not smite thee by day. By these forms of expression
   the Psalmist magnifies the advantages which result to us from our
   having God present with us; and, by the figure synecdoche, under one
   particular, he declares in general that the faithful shall be safe from
   all adversities, defended as they are by Divine power. The language is
   metaphorical, the cold of night and the heat of day denoting all kind
   of inconveniences. The sense then is, that although God's people may be
   subject in common with others to the miseries of human life, yet his
   shadow is always at their side to shield them from thereby receiving
   any harm. The Prophet does not, however, promise the faithful a
   condition of such felicity and comfort as implies an exemption from all
   trouble; he only, for the purpose of assuaging their sorrows, sets
   before them this consolation -- that being interested in the Divine
   layout, they shall be secure from all deadly harm; a point which he
   unfolds more distinctly in the following verses, where he tells us that
   God will so keep his own people from all evils, as to maintain their
   life in safety. The statement in the text before us is indeed general,
   but he afterwards specifies the chief parts of human life.

   8. Jehovah will keep thy going out and thy coming in. The sense is,
   Whatever thou shalt undertake or engage in during thy life shall come
   to a happy and successful termination. God no doubt directs by his Holy
   Spirit the, deliberations of his servants; but it appears to me, that
   this passage is rather to be referred to prosperous issues. If,
   however, any one would give it a more extended meaning I have no
   objection. It is enough for me to embrace that sense which is
   indisputably certain and solid, That God will be the continual guide of
   his people, so that stretching out his hand to them he will conduct
   them according to their hearts' desire from the beginning even to the
   end. Farther, it is of importance to mark the reason why the Prophet
   repeats so often what he had briefly and in one word expressed with
   sufficient plainness. Such repetition seems at first sight superfluous;
   but when we consider how difficult it is to correct our distrust, it
   will be easily perceived that he does not improperly dwell upon the
   commendation of the divine providence. How few are to be found who
   yield to God the honor of being a keeper, in order to their being
   thence assured of their safety, and led to call upon him in the midst
   of their perils! On the contrary, even when we seem to have largely
   experienced what this protection of God implies, we yet instantly
   tremble at the noise of a leaf falling from a tree, as if God had quite
   forgotten us. Being then entangled in so many unholy misgivings, and so
   much inclined to distrust, we are taught from the passage that if a
   sentence couched in a few words does not suffice us, we should gather
   together whatever may be found throughout the whole Scriptures
   concerning the providence of God, until this doctrine-" That God always
   keeps watch for us" -- is deeply rooted in our hearts; so that
   depending upon his guardianship alone we may bid adieu to all the vain
   confidences of the world.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [65] There seems to be an allusion in the first member to sun-strokes,
   which are very fatal in hot countries, sometimes inflicting instant
   death, or being soon followed by death, while at other times, when the
   person lives, he continues through the remainder of his days in a state
   of idiocy. Comparatively few survive and perfectly recover the effects
   of such a visitation. What the Psalmist means by the smiting of the
   moon is at first sight not so obvious. Some suppose that he speaks in
   conformity with a popular belief, which it is supposed prevailed in the
   East in his time, just as it does in the present day, respecting the
   deleterious influence of the moonbeams on the human body, although
   there is no ground for such a belief, the moon no doubt getting the
   blame of the injury done by the cold and dampness of the night. But the
   probability is, that by the striking of the moon he simply alludes to
   the cold of the night, which has very baneful effects on the human
   frame, particularly in such oriental countries as Palestine, where
   there is a sudden change from extreme heat in the day to extreme cold
   in the night.

   PSALM 122

   In this Psalm David congratulates himself and the whole Church upon the
   fact, that a seat had at length been appointed for the ark of the
   covenant, and that God had chosen a place where his name should be
   continually called upon. Afterwards, to incite and encourage the
   faithful to engage in the worship of the sanctuary, he briefly
   declares, that the prosperous condition of the people depended upon
   God's having chosen the seat of royalty to be at Jerusalem, from whence
   it was his purpose to defend, maintain, and assist his people.

   A Song of Degrees of David. [66]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 122:1-3

   1. I was glad when they said to me, We will go into the house of
   Jehovah. 2. Our feet shall be [67] standing within thy gates, O
   Jerusalem! 3. Jerusalem is built as a city, compact in itself together.
   [68]


   1 I was glad when they said to me. God had often told Moses, that his
   Sanctuary would one day have a certain and fixed place of abode; yet
   from the time of Moses, for the space of more than a thousand years,
   the Ark of the Covenant had been carried about from place to place, as
   if it had been in a state of pilgrimage. At length it was revealed to
   David, that mount Zion was the spot where God would have his ark to be
   settled, and his temple built. Now, as David himself received this
   revelation with exceeding great joy, so he affirms that he was glad to
   find the whole people with one consent agreeing thereto. This
   circumstance has not been duly considered, and the consequence is, that
   interpreters have given the unhappy translation--I was glad with those
   that said to me. Such a rendering, however, only renders the sense a
   little obscure; but the translation of the Septuagint and the Vulgate,
   which puts upon the second verb of the verse a neuter signification,
   entirely vitiates the meaning, I was glad in the things which, were
   said to me. I indeed admit that literally the reading is--I was glad in
   those who said to me; but it is no uncommon thing for the letter v,
   beth, which commonly signifies in, to be resolved into the adverb of
   time when; and here the scope of the text requires such a rendering.
   David testifies that he felt in his heart a double joy on observing
   that the whole people concurred in yielding obedience to the oracle
   which declared mount Zion to be the place which God had chosen for his
   solemn worship. By this example we are taught, that our joy, in like
   manner, should be doubled, when God by his Holy Spirit not only frames
   each of us to the obedience of his word, but also produces the same
   effect upon others, that we may be united together in the same faith.
   So stubborn and rebellious is human nature, that the great majority of
   mankind invariably murmur against God whenever he speaks. We have,
   therefore, no small ground for rejoicing when all harmoniously rank
   themselves with us on the side of God. Such as translate, with those
   who said to me, deduce this meaning: I take delight in the company of
   those who allure me to the service of God, and offer themselves to me
   as companions, that we may go to the sanctuary together. But from the
   second verse it will be still more obvious, that the joy of which David
   speaks proceeded from his seeing the people, with the ready obedience
   of faith, giving their consent to the utterance of the heavenly oracle,
   respecting the spot chosen to be the lawful and permanent scat of the
   ark of the covenant. For it immediately follows --

   2. Our feet shall be standing within thy gates, O Jerusalem! In the
   Hebrew text the verb is indeed in the past tense, which it would not be
   unsuitable to retain; but as it makes little difference as to the
   meaning whether the one reading or the other is adopted, I have no
   difficulty in leaving my readers to their own choice. David rehearses
   the language in which all the godly in common expressed themselves --
   that they should at length stand with sure footing in Jerusalem,
   because it was the will of God there to establish his Sanctuary, which
   hitherto had often changed its lodgings, and had been carried from
   place to place. By such a pilgrimage state of the ark, God reminded the
   people that he had not without cause spoken by Moses what I have a
   little ago adverted to. Thus, whenever the ark of the covenant was
   conveyed from one place to another, God thereby stirred up the hearts
   of his servants to desire and pray that a certain settled place might
   be appointed to it. Moreover, this fixing of its seat was not a matter
   of small moment. As while it was frequently changing its abode, the
   faith of the people hung in suspense, so after God had chosen for it a
   permanent residence, he by this testified more unequivocally that he
   would be the ever, lasting and unchangeable protector of his people. It
   is, therefore, not surprising to find the faithful gratefully
   acknowledging that their feet, which had hitherto been wont to run from
   place to place, should henceforth stand steadfast within the gates of
   Jerusalem. The ark, it is true, dwelt a long time in Shiloh, (1 Samuel
   1:3,) but God having made no promise concerning that place, it could
   not be the permanent abode of that symbol of the divine presence. On
   the contrary, since, as we shall see on [2]Psalm 132:14, it was said of
   mount Zion -- "This is my rest for ever," the faithful, depending upon
   that promise, confidently boast that their feet shall hereafter be at
   rest and stand firm. Farther, as Christ,

   "in whom dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily," (Colossians
   2:9,)

   and who is our true Immanuel, (Isaiah 7:14,) now resides amongst us, he
   has furnished us with matter of more abundant joy. We are, therefore,
   ungrateful and stupid, if that promise --

   "Lo, I am wit you always, even unto the end of the world,"
   (Matthew 28:20,)

   does not ravish us with exceeding joy, and especially if we see it in
   any place received publicly and with common consent. What I have just
   now quoted concerning the rest or repose of the Lord, has been at
   length accomplished in the person of Christ, as is evident from Isaiah
   11:10 -- "His rest shall be glorious;" where the Prophet does not speak
   of the burial of Christ, as some interpreters erroneously suppose, but
   of the future distinction of the Church.

   3. Jerusalem is built as a city. Here David begins to celebrate the
   praises of Jerusalem; and he does this with the design of encouraging
   the people to persevere with uniform steadfastness in their obedience.
   It was of great importance for the minds of the godly, instead of being
   drawn hither and thither, to be kept constantly fixed on that city,
   which was the bond of a holy unity. When the people came to be divided
   into two bodies, that was the commencement of melancholy devastation.
   It is not surprising, then, to find David commending with such
   earnestness the place which God had chosen, knowing, as he did, that
   the prosperity of the Church depended upon the children of Abraham
   worshipping God there in purity, according to the appointed observances
   of the law; and next, upon their acknowledging the royal seat which the
   same God had erected there by his own authority, and had taken under
   his own protection When it is said that Jerusalem is built as a city,
   it is not to be understood as referring only to the walls, or towers,
   or ditches of that city, but chiefly to the good order and holy polity
   by which it was distinguished, although I allow that there is some
   allusion to its ancient state. Salem, indeed, had been a noted town
   even from the beginning; but when God selected it to be the head of the
   kingdom, it changed its appearance, and in a manner its nature, so that
   then it began to deserve the name of a well-regulated city. At first
   sight it may seem a poor commendation to call Jerusalem a city; but it
   is to be observed that it is here exhibited as it were standing alone
   in the whole world -- taking the precedence of all other cities, which
   will in vain attempt to equal it. David, certainly, in thus speaking,
   does not intend to divest other cities of the rank to which they may be
   entitled, but he raises Jerusalem higher, that it may appear
   conspicuous above them all, even as we find Isaiah, (Isaiah 2:2,) when
   speaking of mount Zion, asserting that it "shall be established in the
   top of the mountains, and shall be exalted above the hills." In that
   passage the Prophet, to magnify this little hill, brings down the
   loftiest mountains of the world, that they may not obscure its glory.
   In like manner David here affirms that Jerusalem is compacted as a
   city, to induce the faithful, instead of gazing in all directions
   around them, to rest contented with the city which God had chosen,
   since they would nowhere find its equal. After having humbled all other
   cities, he shows, in a few words, the excellence of Jerusalem,
   representing it as regularly built, or fitly and neatly joined together
   in all its parts. Some take these words as expressing literally and
   without figure, that its citizens live together in peace and unity; but
   I see no impropriety in supposing that they describe, metaphorically,
   the peaceable state of a city. Thus the mutual concord which reigns
   among the citizens of a city, and by which they are united to each
   other, is compared to buildings, compacted together by a skillful and
   elegant workmanship, so that there is nothing imperfect, in joined
   together, or rent, but throughout a beautiful harmony'. By this David
   teaches us, that the Church can only remain in a state of safety when
   unanimity prevails in her, and when, being joined together by faith and
   charity, she cultivates a holy unity.

   not a part of Jerusalem, neither it seems was Millo: but he added them
   to the city, and enclosed them within its wall. (2 Samuel 5:7, 9; 1
   Chronicles 11:7, 8.) Solomon afterwards added the hill of Moria, on
   which his temple was built, to Jerusalem." -- Cresswell.

   Psalm 122:4-5

   4. Thither the tribes ascended, the tribes of God, for a testimony to
   Israel, [69] to praise the name of Jehovah. 5. For there were set
   thrones for judgment, the thrones of the house of David.


   4. Thither the tribes ascended. David here invests Jerusalem with two
   titles of honor, calling it the sacred and regularly appointed place
   for calling upon the name of God; and next, the royal sea, to which the
   whole people were to have recourse for obtaining justice. All our
   salvation depends upon these two points; first, that Christ has been
   given to us to be our priest; and, secondly, that he has been
   established king to govern us. This God showed to his ancient people
   under figures. The sanctuary erected on mount Zion was intended to keep
   their faith fixed upon the spiritual priesthood of Christ; and in like
   manner, by the kingdom of David, there was presented to their view an
   image of the kingdom of Christ. The Psalmist, therefore, says in the
   first place, that the tribes or families of God shall come to
   Jerusalem; and then he immediately adds, that there the seat of
   judgment is erected, on which he and his posterity will sit. The reason
   why it was the will of God that there should be only one temple and one
   altar was, that the people might not fall away to various
   superstitions. David therefore here declares that this place was
   appointed by God's own mouth, that all the families of God, or the
   twelve tribes, might there assemble from all quarters. To express more
   plainly how important it was, for this form of God's worship to be
   preserved pure and complete, he says that it was for a testimony The
   noun employed comes from the verb vd, ud, which signifies to bear
   witness, or to covenant. Now by the word in this place is denoted a
   mutual declaration or agreement between God and the people. When the
   tribes shall come thither, says the Prophet substantially, it will not
   be at random, because their fancy thus leads them, but because God by
   his own mouth invites them. The amount therefore is, that the holy
   assemblies which shall be kept at Jerusalem will not be vain and
   unprofitable, since God has made a covenant with his people,
   determining and appointing that place for his service. Whence we learn,
   that in judging of the true temple of God, it is necessary to take into
   account the doctrine taught. With respect to the time in which David
   lived, as God had adopted the Jewish people, and as it was his will
   that they should be employed in the external worship of his name, he
   prescribed to them a rule from which it was unlawful for them to
   deviate. Thus when the faithful assembled on mount Zion, it was not
   foolishness or inconsiderate zeal, or the impulse of their own minds,
   which brought them thither, as if they resembled those men whom we
   daily see inventing for themselves, out of their own heads, numberless
   kinds of divine worship; but they were led thither by the command of
   God, that they might worship him on mount Zion, by which word the
   Prophet intimates, that all other temples are unholy, and all other
   religions perverse and corrupt, because they do not correspond with the
   rule laid down in God's word. He next subjoins the end of this contract
   or covenant, which was that the name of God might be praised. And,
   indeed, as to yield to God the glory of all good things is the end of
   our adoption, so it is the end of all our actions.

   5. For there were set thrones for judgment. He means, that the throne
   of the kingdom was fixed or established at Jerusalem, or that there it
   had its permanent seat. Among that people some order of judgments had
   always existed; these, however, had formerly been in an unsettled
   state, and frequently changed, but God at length ordained, in the
   person of David, a new government which should flow in a continual
   course; for it was his will that the children of David should succeed
   their father in this royal dignity from age to age until the coming of
   Christ. The Prophet has a little before spoken of the Temple and the
   priesthood; and now he affirms, that this kingdom, which God had
   erected, will be firm and stable; in order to distinguish it from all
   the other kingdoms of the world, which are not only temporary, but also
   frail and subject to a variety of changes. This everlastingness of the
   kingdom has been expressly confirmed by other Prophets in various parts
   of their' writings, and not without cause; for the object was, to teach
   the faithful that God would be the guardian of their welfare only upon
   the supposition of their remaining under the protection and defense of
   David, and that, therefore, if they desired to continue in safety and
   to prosper, they should not make for themselves new kings at their own
   pleasure, but should live quietly under that kind of government which
   God had set up among them. The repetition of the word throne is
   emphatic. There, says the Psalmist, the throne of judgment and equity
   is erected. Then he adds, the throne of the house of David; for it was
   the will of God that the right and prerogative of reigning should
   continue in David's posterity, until the true everlastingness of this
   kingdom should be manifested in the person of Christ.

   Phillips adopts a similar rendering, which he supports by the
   following: note: -- "dvt, testimony, and thence a statute or law.
   Amyraldus says -- Quacunque re Deus voluntatem suam significet, id Dei
   testimonium solet appellari.' The particle k should be understood as
   prefixed to this word. The statute spoken of here is that which is
   found in Exodus 23:17, and Deuteronomy 16:16, enjoining the tribes of
   Israel to assemble together before the Lord at the three great feasts.
   The place of their assembling was that which God chose for the
   residence of the ark, which was first at Shiloh, and afterwards at
   Jerusalem." Bishop Horne, and French and Skinner read -- "According to
   the testimony given unto Israel," which brings out exactly the same
   meaning -- testimony denoting, as they explain it, the injunction given
   to the Israelites in that passage in Deuteronomy quoted above.

   Psalm 122:6-9

   6. Pray ye for the peace of Jerusalem: may those who love thee prosper
   7. Peace be within thy bulwarks [70] prosperity [71] within thy towers!
   8. For the sake of my brethren and neighbors, I will now say, Peace be
   within thee! 9. Because of the house of Jehovah our God, I will seek
   thy good.


   6. Pray ye for the peace of Jerusalem. David now exhorts all the devout
   worshippers of God to make supplication for the prosperity of the holy
   city. The more effectually to stir them up to such exercise, he
   promises that, in this way the divine blessing will descend upon them.
   The reason why he was so deeply concerned about the prosperity of
   Jerusalem was, as we have formerly stated -- and he again repeats the
   same thing at the end of the Psalm--because the welfare of the whole
   Church was inseparably connected with that kingdom and priesthood. Now
   as each of us in particular, were the whole Church to be involved in
   ruin, must necessarily perish miserably, it is not surprising to find
   David recommending to all the children of God to cultivate this anxious
   concern about the Church. If we would order our prayers aright, let us
   always begin with pleading that the Lord would be pleased to preserve
   this sacred community. Whoever, confining his attention to his own
   personal advantage, is indifferent about the common weal, he not only
   gives evidence that he is destitute of all true feeling of godliness,
   but in vain desires his own prosperity, and will profit nothing by his
   prayers, since he does not observe the due order. [72] Similar is the
   drift of the promise which is added immediately after: They shall
   prosper that love thee; which, however, may be read in the form of a
   wish, May those who love thee prosper But the sense in either case is
   almost the same. Farther, although the Hebrew verb slh, shalah, which
   the Prophet here uses, signifies to live in quietness or peace, yet as
   the Hebrew noun for peace, from which it is derived, is employed by him
   generally for a joyful and happy condition, I have no doubt that he
   here announces in general to all the godly who have the well being of
   the Church near their heart, that they shall enjoy the blessing of God
   and a prosperous life. This sentence frequently occurs in the
   Prophecies of Isaiah, from the 54th chapter to the end of the book
   (Isaiah 54-66). Hence we learn that the curse of God rests upon all
   such as afflict the Church, or plot and endeavor by any kind of
   mischief to accomplish its destruction.

   7. Peace be within thy bulwarks, etc. The two clauses express the same
   sentiment, and, therefore, the meaning of the first is gathered from
   the second. The term peace signifies nothing else than prosperity. The
   noun slvh, shalvah, in the second clause, sometimes signifies rest, but
   it is more frequently taken for abundance or prosperity On this account
   I have translated the noun vchylk, bechelech, within thy bulwark [73] I
   do not find fault with others who have translated it a ditch or outward
   wall; but the word bulwark agrees better with the word towers, which
   occurs at the close of the verse. The amount is, that David prays for
   the prosperity of the Church through its whole extent. Moreover, it is
   to be noticed, that when he offers supplication for its external
   prosperity, it is not to be understood as implying that he was
   unconcerned about its internal state or spiritual well being; but under
   the similitude of walls, [74] he wishes that on all sides the blessing
   of God may environ and fortify the holy city.

   8. For the sake of my brethren and neighbors. He specifies two causes
   on account of which he felt a care about the Church, for the purpose of
   stirring up, by his example, all the faithful to exercise the same
   care. These words, however, seem to contain a tacit contrast. Among the
   wicked and malicious he might be the object of suspicion, or, at least,
   he was in danger of being slandered; as if, in commending Jerusalem, he
   had rather an eye to his own particular advantage than to the public
   welfare. In order, therefore, to remove all ground for objecting, that
   in thus speaking he was craftily endeavoring to establish his own
   kingdom, he protests, that he is not influenced by personal
   considerations, but by a concern for the whole Church, which he
   embraced with a sincere affection of heart. I will speak, says he, O
   Jerusalem! of thy peace, not because it will be profitable for me or
   mine, but because thy prosperity shall extend itself to all the
   children of God; for under the term brethren he doubtless comprehends
   all believers that he did so, because the worship of God so far from
   remaining entire would go to ruin unless Jerusalem continued standing.
   If then the salvation of our brethren is regarded by us as an object of
   importance, if religion is with us a matter of heart-work, we ought, at
   the same time, as much as in us lies, to take an interest in the
   prosperity of the Church. Whence it follows, that such as are
   indifferent about her condition, are no less cruel than impious; for if
   she is "the pillar and foundation of truth," the inevitable consequence
   of her destruction must be the extinction of true piety. And if the
   body is destroyed, how can each of the members fail to be involved in
   destruction? Farther, this passage teaches us, that the Church is not
   an empty title, but must be sought for where the true religion
   prevails. Whence it appears, how foolish the Papists are, who,
   notwithstanding their having rejected and overthrown the doctrine of
   the Gospel, yet mightily boast of the name of the Church.

   9. Because of the house of Jehovah our God, etc. In this verse he adds
   a second reason why he cared for the Church -- that he did so, because
   the worship of God so far from remaining entire would go to ruin unless
   Jerusalem continued standing. If then the salvation of our brethren is
   regarded by us as an object of importance, if religion is with us a
   matter of heart-work, we ought, at the same time, as much as in us
   lies, to take an interest in the prosperity of the Church. Whence it
   follows, that such are indifferent about her condition, are no less
   cruel than impious; for if she is "the pillar and foundation of truth,"
   the inevitable consequence of her destruction must be the extinction of
   true piety. And if the body is destroyed, how can each of the members
   fail to be involved in destruction? Farther, this passage teaches us
   that the Church is not an empty title, but must be sought for where the
   true religion prevails. Whence it appears, how foolish the Papists are,
   who, notwithstanding their having rejected and overthrown the doctrine
   of the Gospel, yet mightily boast of the name of the Church.

   PSALM 123

   In this Psalm, the faithful oppressed with the cruel tyranny of their
   enemies, beseech God to deliver them, there being no other source of
   hope left for them except in his protection.

   A Song of Degrees.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 123:1-4

   1. I lift up my eyes to thee, who dwellest in the heavens. 2. Behold!
   as the eyes of servants look [75] to the hand of their roadsters; as
   the eyes of a handmaid look to the hand of her mistress, so do our eyes
   to Jehovah our God, until he have mercy upon us. 3. Have mercy upon us
   O Jehovah have mercy upon us; for we are greatly cloyed with reproach.
   4. Our soul is in itself greatly cloyed with the mockery of men who are
   rich, and with the contempt of the proud.


   1. I lift my eyes to thee, who dwellest in the heavens. It is uncertain
   at what time, or even by what Prophet, this Psalm was composed. I do
   not think it probable that David was its author; because, when he
   bewails the persecutions which he suffered in the time of Saul, it is
   usual with him to inter-pose some particular references to himself. My
   opinion, then, rather is, that this form of prayer was composed for all
   the godly by some Prophet, either when the Jews were captives in
   Babylon, or when Antiochus Epiphanes exercised towards them the most
   relentless cruelty. Be this as it may, the Holy Spirit, by whose
   inspiration the Prophet delivered it to the people, calls upon us to
   have recourse to God, when -- ever wicked men unrighteously and proudly
   persecute, not one or two of the faithful only, but the whole body of
   the Church. Moreover, God is here expressly called the God who dwelleth
   in the heavens, not simply to teach his people to estimate the divine
   power as it deserves, but also that, when no hope of aid is left for
   them on earth, yea rather, when their condition is desperate, just as
   if they were laid in the grave, or as if they were lost in a labyrinth,
   they should then remember that the power of God remains in heaven in
   unimpaired and infinite perfection. Thus these words seem to contain a
   tacit contrast between the troubled and confused state of this world
   and God's heavenly kingdom, from whence he so manages and governs all
   things, that whenever it pleases him, he calms all the agitations of
   the world, comes to the rescue of the desperate and the despairing,
   restores light by dispelling darkness, and raises up such as were cast
   down and laid prostrate on the ground. This the Prophet confirms by the
   verb lift up; which intimates, that although all worldly resources fail
   us, we must raise our eyes upward to heaven, where God remains
   unchangeably the same, despite the mad impetuosity of men in turning
   all things here below upside down.

   2. Behold as the eyes of servants look to the hand of their masters.
   This similitude is very suitable to the present case. It implies that
   without the protection of God true believers have no comfort, are
   completely disarmed and exposed to all manner of wrongs, have neither
   strength nor courage to resist; in short, that their safety depends
   entirely upon aid derived from another. We know how shamefully servants
   were treated in ancient times, and what reproaches might be cast upon
   them, whilst yet they durst not move a finger to repel the outrage.
   Being therefore deprived of all means of defending themselves, the only
   thing which remained for them to do was, what is here stated, to crave
   the protection of their masters. The same explanation is equally
   applicable to the case of handmaids Their condition was indeed shameful
   and degrading; but there is no reason why we should be ashamed of, or
   offended at being compared to slaves, provided God is our defender, and
   takes our life under his guardianship; God, I say, who purposely
   disarms us and strips us of all worldly aid, that we may learn to rely
   upon his grace, and to be contented with it alone. It having been
   anciently a capital crime for bond-men to carry a sword or any other
   weapon about them, and as they were exposed to injuries of every
   description, their masters were wont to defend them with so much the
   more spirit, when any one causelessly did them violence. Nor can it be
   doubted that God, when he sees us placing an exclusive dependence upon
   his protection, and renouncing all confidence in our own resources,
   will as our defender encounter, and shield us from all the molestation
   that shall be offered to us. It is, however, certain that we have here
   properly the description of a period in which the people of God were
   reduced to a state of extreme necessity, and brought even to the brink
   of despair. As to the word hand, it is very well known to be put for
   help. [76]

   3. Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah! etc. The Psalmist prosecutes and
   confirms the preceding doctrine. He had said that the godly, finding
   themselves utterly broken in spirit and cast down, intently directed
   their eyes to the hand of God: now he adds that they are filled with
   reproach. From this we learn that the wicked not only assaulted them by
   such ways of violence as suggested themselves to their minds, but that
   by their mockery they as it were trampled under foot the children of
   God. The repetition of the prayer, Have mercy upon us, which is a sign
   of vehement and ardent desire, indicates that they were reduced to the
   last degree of misery. When insult is added to wrongs, there is nothing
   which inflicts a deeper wound upon well constituted minds. The Prophet
   therefore complains chiefly of that, as if it were the consummation of
   all calamities. He says that rich and proud men treated the Church with
   insolent triumph; for it commonly happens that those who are elevated
   hi the world, look down with contempt upon the people of God. The
   lustre of their he. hour and power dazzles their eyes, so that they
   make no account of God's spiritual kingdom: yea, the more the wicked
   prosper and are smiled on by fortune, to the greater extent does their
   pride swell, and the more violently does it throw off its foam. This
   passage teaches us, that it is no new thing for the Church to be held
   in contempt by the children of this world who abound in riches. The
   epithet proud is justly applied to the same persons who are described
   as rich; for wealth engenders pride of heart. Farther, as we see that
   in old time the Church of God was covered with reproaches, and pointed
   at with the finger of scorn, we ought not to be discouraged if the
   world despise us, nor should we allow our faith to be shaken by the
   wicked when they assault us with their scoffs, yea, even defame us with
   their injurious and insulting language. We must always bear in mind
   what is here recorded, that the heart not of one man only, or of a few,
   but of the whole Church, was filled not merely with the violence,
   cruelty, craft, and other evil doings of the wicked, but also with
   reproaches and mockery. It is also to be remembered, that all the
   loftiness and pride existing in the world are here represented as in
   opposition to the Church, so that she is accounted as nothing better
   than "the filth of the world and the offscouring of all things," as the
   Apostle Paul declares in 1 Corinthians. 4:13. When the same thing
   happens to us at the present day, let us leave the wicked to swell with
   their pride until they burst; and let it suffice us to know, that we
   are notwithstanding precious in the sight of God. By the verb cloy,
   especially as it is emphatically repeated, the Prophet intended to
   express a long continued oppression, which filled the hearts of the
   godly with weariness and sorrow. How necessary the lesson taught in
   this text is in our own day, it requires no lengthened discussion to
   demonstrate. We see the Church destitute of all worldly protection, and
   lying under the feet of her enemies, who abound in riches, and are
   armed with dreadful power. We see the Papists boldly rising up, and
   with all their might pouring forth their mockeries against us and the
   whole service of God. On the other hand, there are mingled amongst us,
   and flying about everywhere, Epicureans, who deride our simplicity.
   There are also many giants, who overwhelm us with reproaches; and this
   baseness has lasted from the time that the Gospel began to emerge from
   the corruption's of Popery even to the present day. What then remains
   to be done, but that, finding ourselves environed with darkness on all
   sides, we seek the light of life in heaven? and that our soul, although
   it may be filled to satiety with all kinds of reproaches, breathe forth
   prayers to God for deliverance with the importunity of the famished?

   towards their masters, and this agrees with -- so our eyes wait upon
   the Lord. But the Hebrew word also signifies power, (as in Deuteronomy
   32:36,) which may very well be substituted for. hand in this place, the
   notion being that servants when they are in danger or in distress look
   to the power of their masters for assistance; and in general expect
   from them subsistence and defense." -- Cresswell.

   PSALM 124

   The Church having been providentially delivered from extreme peril,
   David exhorts true believers to thanksgiving, and teaches them by this
   memorable example, that their safety depends solely upon the grace and
   power of God.

   A Song of Degrees of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 124:1-5

   1. But for Jehovah, who was on our side, may Israel now say; 2. But for
   Jehovah who was on our side, when men rose up against us; 3. They had
   then swallowed us up alive, when their wrath was kindled against us; 4.
   The waters had then overwhelmed us, the torrent had gone over our soul:
   5. The proud waters [77] had then gone over our soul.


   1. But for Jehovah, who was on our side. Some expositors think that
   this Psalm describes the very sad and calamitous condition of the
   Church when the, residue of the people were carried away into Babylon.
   This opinion is, however, without any good foundation for the
   complaints made, apply with equal propriety to the persecutions which
   the Church suffered under the tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes. It is
   another objection to this interpretation, that the Psalm bears in its
   inscription the name of David, and historically recounts the
   deliverance which the people had obtained from extreme danger by the
   power of God. To get quit of this difficulty they observe, that what
   had not yet come to pass is described prophetically; but this is a
   forced conjecture, for the Prophets usually speak of things to come in
   a different manner. It is more probable that David here sets forth a
   known history, and exhorts the faithful to reflect upon the divine
   succor which they had already actually experienced. I dare not,
   however, limit what is here spoken to David's time. It is indeed true
   that the heathen nations often waged war against the people of God,
   armed with such power as to come rushing upon them with the impetuosity
   of a deluge; but as David does not specify any particular instance, he
   is not, I conceive, to be understood as celebrating only some one
   deliverance, but in general all the instances in which God had
   succoured his Church. The heathen at many different times, as is well
   known, rose up against the Church, with such mighty hosts, that she was
   brought almost to the verge of destruction. David then represents as in
   a mirror the uncertain and changeable condition of the Church, just
   such as it had been from the beginning, to teach the faithful that its
   stability had not been owing to its own intrinsic strength, but that it
   had been preserved by the wonderful grace of God; and to habituate them
   to call upon God in the midst of dangers.

   2. But for Jehovah who was on our side. It is not without cause that he
   twice repeats the same sentence. So long as we are in danger our fear
   is immoderate; but no sooner are we delivered than we lessen the
   greatness of our calamity, and Satan, deceiving us by this artifice,
   leads us to obscure the grace of God. Since then, after having been
   wonderfully preserved by the Lord, we for the most part devise all
   sorts of imaginary circumstances, in order to efface from our minds the
   remembrance of his grace, David, by introducing the people as struck
   with amazement, purposely dwells upon the amplification of the danger.
   In these words a bridle is put upon us, to keep us meditating upon our
   dangers, lest the sense of God's grace should vanish from our minds.
   The common translation, Had not the Lord been on our side, does not
   sufficiently express David's meaning; for he affirms that the
   deliverance and the salvation of the people proceeded from nothing else
   than God's succor, and at the same time shows that this succor was both
   certain and evident. Two things then are here to be distinctly noticed;
   first, that the Lord had been at hand to afford aid to his servants,
   and had taken their part; and secondly, that being already in a
   desperate condition, they could not by help from any other quarter, or
   in another manner, have escaped from danger. Thus we are taught, that
   men then only ascribe the glory of their preservation to God, when they
   are persuaded of his being so favourably inclined towards them as to
   defend them and maintain them safe. In the second clause there is
   extolled in high terms the infinite power of God, of which he had given
   abundant proof in delivering the people, to teach us that such a manner
   of preserving does not belong to man. By the noun 'dm, adam, which when
   it is collective signifies men in general, David seems to denote a vast
   number of enemies. The people of God, as if he had said, had not to
   contend merely against a few men, or against one nation, but were
   assailed by almost the whole world; it being abundantly manifest that
   all mankind were the enemies of the Jews.

   When he says, (Psalm 124:3,) They had swallowed us up alive, [78] he
   not only expresses barbarous cruelty, but also disproportion of
   strength. He describes then in the first place how violent was the
   onset of the enemy, and secondly, how feeble and inadequate the Jews
   were to withstand them, since these cruel beasts had no need of swords
   for slaughter, but without a battle or an effort of strength, could
   easily devour that unwarlike and defenceless flock.

   4. The waters had then overwhelmed us. He embellishes by an elegant
   metaphor the preceding sentiment, comparing the dreadful impetuosity of
   the enemies of the Jews to an inundation, which swallows up whatever it
   meets with in its overflowing course. And he continues to preserve the
   character of a man affrighted. He names the waters, next the torrent,
   thirdly, the proud or impetuous waters. He says, over us, and over our
   soul, as if, by presenting the thing to the eye, he intended to strike
   terror into the people. And certainly this impassioned language ought
   to have all the effect of a graphic representation, that the faithful
   might the better feel from what a profound gulf they had been rescued
   by the hand of God. He only truly attributes his deliverance to God,
   who acknowledges himself to have been lost before he was delivered. The
   adverb them is here either demonstrative, as if the Psalmist had
   pointed to the thing with the finger, or it is taken for long ago. The
   former signification is, however, more suitable to the present passage.

   Psalm 124:6-8

   6. Blessed be Jehovah! who gave us not for a prey to their teeth [79]
   7. Our soul has been rescued as a bird from the snare of the fowlers;
   the snare has been broken, and we have been delivered [80] 8. Our help
   is in the name of Jehovah, who made heaven and earth.


   6. Blessed be Jehovah! The Psalmist now exhorts the godly to a grateful
   acknowledgment of the divine goodness, and as it were puts words into
   their mouth. Here also he shows by another similitude, that it would
   have been all over with them had not God succoured them; affirming that
   they were delivered not otherwise than if some one had plucked the prey
   from the teeth of a wild and cruel beast. Of the same import is the
   third similitude, That they were on all sides entrapped and entangled
   in the snares of their enemies, even as little birds caught in the net
   he stretched under the hand of the fowler; and that when they were
   delivered, it was just as if one should set at liberty birds which had
   been taken. The amount is, that the people of God, feeble, without
   counsel, and destitute of aid, had not only to deal with blood-thirsty
   and furious beasts, but were also ensnared by bird-nets and stratagems,
   so that being greatly inferior to their enemies as well in policy as in
   open force, they were besieged by many deaths. From this it may be
   easily gathered that they were miraculously preserved.

   8. Our help is in the name of Jehovah. David here extends to the state
   of the Church in all ages that which the faithful had already
   experienced. As I interpret the verse, he not only gives thanks to God
   for one benefit, but affirms that the Church cannot continue safe
   except in so far as she is protected by the hand of God. His object is
   to animate the children of God with the assured hope, that their life
   is in perfect safety under the divine guardianship. The contrast
   between the help of God, and other resources in which the world vainly
   confides, as we have seen in Psalm 20:7,

   "Some trust in chariots, and some in horses, but we will remember the
   name of the Lord our God,"

   is to be noticed, that the faithful, purged from all false confidence,
   may betake themselves exclusively to his succor, and depending upon it,
   may fearlessly despise whatever Satan and the world may plot against
   them. The name of God is nothing else than God himself; yet it tacitly
   conveys a significant idea, implying that as he has disclosed to us his
   grace by his word, we have ready access to him, so that in seeking him
   we need not go to a distance, or follow long circuitous paths. Nor is
   it without cause that the Psalmist again honors God with the title of
   Creator. We know with what disquietude our minds are agitated till they
   have raised the power of God to its appropriate elevation, that, the
   whole world being put under, it alone may be pre-eminent; which cannot
   be the case unless we are persuaded that all things are subject to his
   will. He did not show once and in a moment his power in the creation of
   the world and then withdraw it, but he continually demonstrates it in
   the government of the world. Moreover, although all men freely and
   loudly confess that God is the Creator of heaven and of earth, so that
   even the most wicked are ashamed to withhold from him the honor of this
   title, yet no sooner does any terror present itself to us than we are
   convicted of unbelief in hardly setting any value whatever upon the
   help which he has to bestow.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [79] The Church's escape, be it observed, as appears from verse third,
   is likened to a rescue from the jaws of a ferocious animal, which
   swallows its prey quick, or alive.

   [80] The reader will perceive, that as the imagery goes on it becomes
   the more beautiful. Pleasing and tender ideas are associated with the
   escape of an innocent bird from the snares which the art and cruelty of
   man had contrived, to deprive it of life, or rob it of liberty.

   PSALM 125

   As the faithful being mingled in this world with the ungodly seem to be
   exposed to all the ills of life in the same manner as other people, the
   Prophet, comparing them to Jerusalem, shows that they are defended by
   an invincible bulwark. And if God at any time suffer them to be plagued
   by the malice of the wicked, he exhorts them to be of good hope. He
   however at the same time distinguishes between true and false
   Israelites, that hypocrites may not apply to themselves what is here
   said concerning the safety of the righteous.

   A Song of Degrees.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 125:1-2

   1. They who confide in Jehovah "are" as mount Zion, "which" shall not
   be removed, "but" shall abide for ever. [81] 2. As the mountains are
   round about Jerusalem, so Jehovah round about his people, henceforth
   and for ever.


   1. They who confide in Jehovah are as mount Zion. The present Psalm
   differs from the preceding in this -- that while in the other it was
   said that the Church had been preserved by the power of God, without
   any human means, the Holy Spirit, in the one before us, teaches that in
   the time to come she shall always continue in perfect safety, because
   she is defended by the invincible power of God. When the Church is
   emblematically described by the situation of the city of Jerusalem, the
   design of the Prophet is to encourage each of the faithful to believe,
   that the safety promised in common to all the chosen people belongs to
   him. But in exhibiting to the eyes a visible image of the Church, he
   accommodates himself to the rudeness of those who, detained by the
   dulness of the flesh, still continue settled down in the earth. It
   ought then, in the first place, to be noticed, that to those who may
   not sufficiently apprehend by faith the secret protection of God, the
   mountains which environ Jerusalem are exhibited as a mirror, in which
   they may see, beyond all doubt, that the Church is as well defended
   from all perils, as if it were surrounded on all sides with like walls
   and bulwarks. Moreover, it is profitable to know what I have just now
   touched upon -- that whenever God speaks to all his people in a body,
   he addresses himself also to each of them in particular. As not a few
   of the promises are extended generally to the whole body of the Church,
   so many contemplate them as at a distance, as far removed from them,
   and will not presume to appropriate them to themselves. The rule here
   prescribed must therefore be observed, which is, that each apply to
   himself whatever God promises to his Church in common. Nor does the
   Psalmist without cause make Jerusalem a representation of the Church,
   for the sanctuary of God and the ark of the covenant were there.

   With respect to the explanation of the words, it is to be observed that
   the last two verbs of the first verse may be understood in two ways.
   They may both be governed by Jerusalem as the nominative. But some
   understand the first verb, l' ymvt al, lo yimmot, shall not be removed,
   only as spoken of Jerusalem and the latter verb, ysv, yesheb, shall
   abide, as referring to the faithful, so that according to this view
   there is a change of number, which is very common among the Hebrews --
   the singular number, ysv, yesheb, being used instead of the plural,
   ysvv, yeshbu. And certainly the sentence might not improperly be
   translated thus: They who trust in Jehovah, as mount Zion shall not be
   removed, shall dwell for ever, or continue steadfast, for the verb
   translated to abide is taken in this sense. We now perceive the meaning
   of the Prophet, which is, that although the world is subject to so many
   and so sudden changes as almost to put on a new face every moment, and
   although the faithful are mingled with and placed in the same external
   condition as others, yet their safety continues steadfast under the
   invincible protection of God. Not that they are permitted to dwell
   undisturbed and at ease; but because their safety being under the
   guardianship of God is assaulted in vain; at least they can never
   altogether fall, although they may stumble. But let us notice that the
   word hvmchym, habbtechim, which signifies, those who hope or wait for,
   conveys an implicit injunction to steadfastness of faith. Whoever,
   then, desires to be sustained by the hand of God, let him constantly
   lean upon it; and whoever would be defended by it, let him patiently
   repose himself under it. When God suffers us to be often carried hither
   and thither, or driven about like chaff by the wind, this comes to pass
   through our own inconstancy -- because we prefer fluttering in the air
   to fixing our minds on the rock of his help. The similitude employed in
   the second verse is abundantly plain, teaching us, that as the
   continuous chain of mountains round about Jerusalem exhibits the
   appearance of walls, so God encompasses the faithful by his power, to
   ward off from them all harm. [82] Similar forms of expression are
   frequently to be met with in the Scriptures' God often promises to be a
   wall and a fore-wall to his people. But David, or whoever was the
   author of the psalm, proceeds still farther, showing under the figure
   of mountains the secret protection with which God defends his own
   people, to the end that the ignorant and feeble-minded who are still
   held down to the earth by their own dulness of understanding, aided by
   the sight of the mountains, may raise their minds upwards to the
   conception and contemplation of heavenly things.

   are taken from the French version.

   Psalm 125:3-5

   3. For the scepter [83] of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of
   the just, lest the just should put faith their hands to iniquity. 4. Do
   good, O Jehovah to the good, and to those who are upright in their
   hearts. 5. But those who turn aside into their crooked paths, [84]
   Jehovah will make them walk with the workers of iniquity. But there
   shall be peace upon Israel.


   3. For the scepter of the wicked shall not rest upon the lot of the
   just. This is, as it were, a correction of the preceding sentence. The
   Psalmist had said that the hand of God was extended on all sides to
   defend his Church. But as we are disposed to draw the divine promises
   to our own advantage, in the way of interpreting them as securing our
   exemption from all trouble, we are here warned that the guardianship of
   God does not secure us from being sometimes exercised with the cross
   and afflictions, and that therefore the faithful ought not to promise
   themselves a delicate and easy life in this world, it being enough for
   them not to be abandoned of God when they stand in need of his help.
   Their heavenly Father, it is true, loves them most tenderly, but he
   will have them awakened by the cross, lest they should give themselves
   too much to the pleasures of the flesh. If, therefore, we embrace this
   doctrine, although we may happen to be oppressed by the tyranny of the
   wicked, we will wait patiently till God either break their scepter, or
   shake it out of their hands. It is a sore temptation, I admit, to see
   the wicked exercising cruelty in the heritage of the Lord, and the
   faithful lying extended beneath their feet; but as God does not without
   just reason thus humble his people, they should comfort themselves from
   the consideration suggested in the text.

   The reason is added why God will not suffer the wicked always to
   triumph over the righteous -- namely, lest the just, overcome by
   temptation, abandon themselves wholly to sinning, a reason which ought
   to be carefully marked. Hence we gather that God, from his willingness
   to bear with our weakness, moderates our adversities. Although, then,
   we may not possess in ourselves a sufficient amount of fortitude and
   constancy to enable us to persevere in our duty for a single moment,
   yet let this sentiment be present to our minds, That God will take care
   that, broken as we may be by afflictions, we shall not forsake his
   service. Were he even to afflict us without intermission during the
   whole course of our life, the cross is doubtless always profitable to
   us; for we see how indomitable is the rebellion of our flesh, and with
   what vehement impetuosity it is continually boiling up; yea, rather how
   it ceases not to kick amidst the very afflictions by which it ought to
   be reduced to obedience. So much the more necessary then is this lesson
   of instruction -- that the Lord seasonably sets limits to our
   temptations, because he knows that we are too feeble to withstand them.
   Nor does the Prophet merely say, that the weak are in danger of
   failing, but that even the just, who serve God in truth and from the
   heart, and who are devoted to the cultivation of a holy life, are in
   danger of sinking under the load. However vigorous, then, the fear of
   God may be in our hearts, let us remember that we are not endowed with
   adequate strength for enduring to the end, unless the Lord have a
   regard to our infirmity. If the Holy Spirit makes this declaration
   concerning the best champions, what will be the case as to tyroes, who
   are as yet but imperfectly trained for the combat? It is also proper to
   mark the form of speech employed -- lest they stretch forth their
   hands; by which it is intimated that the assaults of temptations are so
   violent, that the hands of the just, which were before, as we may say,
   bound, and whose motions were also framed and regulated according to
   the will of God, being now, as it were, let loose, apply themselves to
   the commission of sin without restraint.

   4. Do good, O Jehovah to the good. The Prophet has already promised to
   all the faithful the seasonable help of God; but still he has recourse
   to prayer, and that not without cause; for although faith may sustain
   us, yet, as our carnal sense and reason are wavering, we ought to
   mingle prayers for our confirmation. Let us then follow this rule of
   the Prophet, who, having exhorted all the faithful to cherish
   confidence, teaches them at the same time, that instead of sitting in
   listless inactivity, they should betake themselves to God, earnestly
   beseeching him by prayer, for what he has bidden them hope for by his
   word. And assuredly the importance of using this remedy is apparent
   from the consideration, that amidst the darkness of afflictions, the
   aid of God is not discerned, but that he rather seems to make no
   difference between the righteous and the wicked. Nor does the Psalmist
   simply pray that God would deal graciously with the good, he also
   defines the goodness by which they are characterized, as what proceeds
   from sincere affection of heart. It would not be enough for the
   children of God to abstain from all wrong-doing, were they not
   distinguished by corresponding integrity of heart, or rather did it not
   govern their whole life.

   5. But those who turn aside into their crooked paths, etc. As the
   participle hmtym, hammattim, is in the conjugation Hiphil, it should,
   according to the rules of grammar, be rather translated in an active
   sense -- those who cause to turn aside; but it being no uncommon thing
   for verbs in that conjugation to be taken in a neuter sense, the,
   version which I have followed is probably the correct one. Still, as
   the active signification is not less appropriate, I would leave the
   reader freely to exercise his own judgment. The meaning is, that God
   does not always connive at the wickedness of those who, while boasting
   of a hollow and counterfeit profession, wander hither and thither
   according to their own lust, or even corrupt the simple, and draw them
   into the same excess of sinning with themselves. I have no doubt that
   the Psalmist here speaks of hypocrites, who are so hardened by
   temporary impunity, as to claim to themselves a place among the holiest
   of men, because God exercises forbearance towards them. Not only do we
   see the good mingled with the bad in the world, but we also behold on
   the barn-floor of the Lord the wheat lying hidden under the chaff and
   refuse. In this dubious and confused state of matters, the bad are
   elated with pride, as if they were among the best of God's servants. We
   ought therefore to pray that God would drag them into the light, and,
   with the workers of iniquity, thrust them down into the punishment
   which they have deserved. The consequence is that peace, which the
   Prophet desires may be the privilege of Israel. He does not speak
   generally of all the race of Abraham, according to the flesh; he rather
   wishes that the Church of God may be purged of hypocrites, who occupy a
   place in her, until God lift up his hand to judgment. On this account I
   have said, that the peace of the Church springs from this -- that; God,
   while executing his just vengeance upon reigned and counterfeit
   Israelites, who rend and tear in pieces her bowels, gathers together
   the upright in heart, and openly shows by his blessing the fatherly
   love which he bears towards them.

   dominion, i.e. scepter. This notion of svt comports better with that of
   gvrl[the word for the lot of]; and so the sense of the whole expression

   PSALM 126

   This Psalm consists of three parts. First, the Prophet exhorts the
   faithful, who had returned from the captivity, to gratitude, and highly
   extols the grace displayed in their deliverance, to show them, beyond
   all doubt, that they were brought back to their own country by the hand
   of God, and not by a fortuitous conjuncture of circumstances, or by the
   favor of men. In the second part a prayer is added, that God would
   perfect his own work which he had begun. Finally, although there was no
   immediate prospect of a full restoration, yet he mitigates the feeling
   of weariness which delay might occasion, and assures them, that though
   at present the seed was watered with tears, the harvest would be
   joyous.

   A Song of Degrees.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 126:1-3

   1. When Jehovah brought back the captivity [85] of Zion, we were like
   those that dream. 2. Now shall our mouth be filled [86] with laughter,
   and our tongue with rejoicing: now shall they say [87] among the
   heathen, Jehovah hath done great things for them. 3. Jehovah hath done
   great things for us, whereof we have been made glad.


   1. When Jehovah brought back the captivity of Zion, etc. It is
   unnatural and forced to suppose, with some expositors, that this is a
   prediction of what was to come. For my part I have no doubt that the
   Psalm was composed upon the return of the Jewish people from the
   Babylonish captivity; and for this reason I have translated the verb
   vsvv, beshub, in the past tense. Now, whoever was the author of it,
   [88] whether one of the Levites or one of the Prophets, he affirms that
   the manner of their deliverance was too wonderful to be attributed to
   fortune, in order to lead the faithful to the conclusion that the
   prophecy of Jeremiah, which had assigned seventy years as the term of
   the captivity, was truly fulfilled. (Jeremiah 25:12, and Jeremiah
   29:10.) By the verb dream, which expresses the astonishing character of
   the event, he teaches us that there is no room left for ingratitude. As
   often as God works by ordinary means, men, through the malignity of
   their natures, usually exercise their ingenuity in devising various
   causes of the deliverance wrought, in order to darken the grace of God.
   But the return of the Jewish people from the Babylonish captivity,
   having been a miracle of such splendor as was sufficient to swallow up
   and confound all the thoughts of men, it compels us to own that it was
   a signal work of God. This is the reason why the Prophet compares this
   deliverance to a dream. "So far," he materially says, "is any mind from
   comprehending this unparalleled benefit of God, that the bare thinking
   upon it transports us with amazement, as if it were a dream, and not an
   event which had already taken place. What impiety, then, will it be,
   not to acknowledge the author of it." Moreover, he does not mean that
   the faithful were so dull of understanding as not to perceive that they
   were delivered by the hand of God, but only that, judging according to
   carnal sense and reason, they were struck with astonishment; and he was
   apprehensive lest, in reasoning with themselves about that redemption,
   as about an ordinary thing, they should make less account of the power
   of God than it became them to do. The noun syvt, shibath, translated
   captivity, might be rendered bringing back, as some do, which would
   give greater elegance to the expression of the Psalmist, as in that
   case syvt would be a noun of the same verb which is used in the
   beginning of the verse. [89] As, however, this makes little difference
   in regard to the sense, it is enough to have noticed it to my readers
   in passing.

   2. Now shall our mouth be filled with laughter. The adverb of time, 'z,
   az, is commonly translated then; but as the verbs are in the future
   tense, I have thought that it might not be improper to translate tires
   -- grow shall our mouth be filled, and now shall they say. If, however,
   we admit what some Hebrew Doctors affirm, that the force of this
   particle is to change the future tense into the past, the adverb then
   will be the appropriate word. The design of the Prophet is not at all
   obscure. He would have the people so to rejoice on account of their
   return, as not to bury in forgetfulness the grace of God. He therefore
   describes no ordinary rejoicing, but such as so fills their minds as to
   constrain them to break forth into extravagance of gesture and of
   voice. At the same time he intimates that there was good ground for
   this joy, in which it became the children of God to indulge, on account
   of their return to their own land. As there was at that period nothing
   more wretched than for them to live in captivity, in which they were in
   a manner dispossessed of the inheritance God had promised them; so
   there was nothing which ought to have been more desirable to them than
   to be restored. Their restoration to their own country having been
   therefore a proof of their renewed adoption by God, it is not
   surprising to find the Prophet asserting that their mouth was filled
   with laughter, and their tongue with exultation. With a similar joy
   does it become us at the present day to exult when God gathers together
   his Church and it is an undoubted evidence that we are steel-hearted,
   if her miserable dispersion does not produce in our minds grief and
   lamentation. The Prophet proceeds farther, declaring that this miracle
   was seen even by the blind; for in that age of the world, as is well
   known, the heathen were wandering in darkness like blind men, no
   knowledge of God having shone upon them; and yet God's power and
   operation were so conspicuous in that event, that they burst forth into
   the open acknowledgment that God had done great things for his people.
   So much the more shame-fill then was the indifference of the Jews to be
   accounted, if they did not freely and loudly celebrate God's grace,
   which had acquired so much renown among the unbelieving. The form of
   speech employed is also to be marked, which forcibly expresses the idea
   intended to be conveyed, that the mighty power of God in this
   deliverance was known by the Gentiles. In the following verse the
   Prophet repeats in his own person, and in that of the Church, the words
   uttered by the heathen in the last member of the preceding verse. Let
   us at least, as if he had said, put forth a confession corresponding to
   that which God has extorted from the unbelieving Gentiles. When he adds
   that they were glad, there is an implied antithesis between this fresh
   joy and the long continued sorrow with which they were afflicted in
   their captivity, he expressly declares that joy was restored to them,
   to enable them the better to estimate the dismal condition from which
   they had been extricated.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [85] The abstract noun is put for the concrete, "the captivity of Zion"
   for "the captives of Zion" -- those who were led away captive from
   Zion. Accordingly, in the French version, Calvin uses the concrete
   --"Les captifs;" --"The captives."

   [86] "Ou, alors nostre bouche a este remplie." -- Fr. marg. "Or, then
   our mouth was filled."

   [87] "Ou, alors on disoit." -- Fr. marg. "Or, then they said."

   [88] Grotius and Amyraldus suppose that it was compiled by Ezra, after
   the Jews had begun to return from Babylon.

   [89] That is, it would be derived from svv, shrub, he returned; whereas
   if it is rendered captivity, it is derived from svh, shabah, he led
   captive. The English Bible translators seem to have been uncertain
   whether syvt, shibath, is to be considered as derived from the first of
   these verbs or from the second, their reading in the text being,
   "turned back our captivity," and their marginal rendering being,
   "returned the returning." There is a play upon the words, svv, "turn,"
   and syvt, "captivity." It is to be observed that the concluding part of
   the above sentence in the text is from Calvin's French Commentary.
   There is nothing to represent it in the Latin Version.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 126:4-6

   4. O Jehovah! bring back our captivity, [90] as rivers in the south.
   [91] 5. They who sow in tears shall reap in joy. 6. Going forth, he
   shall go and weep, carrying the price of the seed: coming, he shall
   return with rejoicing, carrying his sheaves with him.


   4. O Jehovah! bring back our captivity. The second part of the Psalm,
   as I have said, contains a prayer that God would gather together the
   residue of the captives. The Holy Spirit endited this form of prayer
   for the Jews who were already come home to their own country, that they
   might not forget their poor brethren who were still in exile. All the
   Jews, no doubt, had a door opened to them, and perfect liberty granted
   them, to come out of the land of their captivity, but the number of
   those who partook of this benefit was small when compared with the vast
   multitude of the people. Some were kept from returning by fear, and
   others by sloth and want of courage, on seeing such perils at hand as
   they apprehended they had not power to overcome, choosing rather to lie
   torpid in their own filthiness, than to undertake the hardship of the
   journey. It is probable also that many of them preferred their present
   ease and comfort to eternal salvation. What the Prophet Isaiah had
   foretold was no doubt fulfilled, (Isaiah 10:22,). That although the
   people were in number as the sand of the sea, yet only a remnant of
   them should be saved. Since, then, many openly refused the benefit when
   it was offered them, and as there were not; wanting many difficulties
   and impediments to be encountered by those who availed themselves of
   this liberty granted them by the good pleasure of the king, [92] so
   that it was only a few of sounder judgment and of a more intrepid
   heart, who dared to move a foot -- and even they with reluctance, -- it
   is no wonder that the Prophet requires the Church still to make
   supplication to God for the bringing back of the captivity. Along with
   this, the state of those who had already returned is also to be noted;
   for their land being in the possession of strangers, who were all their
   inveterate and sworn enemies, they were no less captives in their own
   country than among the Babylonians. It was therefore necessary, on a
   twofold account, that the Church should earnestly beseech God to gather
   together such as were dispersed; first, that he would give courage to
   the timid, awaken the torpid, cause the besotted to forget their
   pleasures, and stretch forth his hand to be a guide to all; and,
   secondly, that he would settle the body of the people who had returned
   in liberty and ease.

   As to the similitude which follows, many think the sense to be, that
   the bringing back of their captivity prayed for would be as grateful to
   them as if water should flow through a desert. [93] We know how
   grievous and painful a thing it is to travel in a hot country through
   and sands. The south, is taken for the wilderness, because the region
   on the south of Judea was waste and almost uninhabitable. Yet it seems
   to me more just to say, that the grace of God is here magnified, and
   still more enlarged by the Prophet's comparing it to a miracle.
   "Although it is a difficult matter," he substantially says, "for the
   dispersed remnant to be again united into one body, yet God, if he
   please, can do this, just as he can cause rivers of water to flow
   through a parched desert." He, at the same time, alludes to the road
   intervening between Judea and Babylon, as appears from the situation of
   the two countries. Thus the words will not require any supplement, the
   meaning being simply this, that the bringing back of their captivity
   would be as if a river should run through a barren and and country.
   And, certainly, to open up a way for the people who, so to speak, were
   swallowed up in a deep gulf, was as if a course had been opened up for
   irrigating waters to flow through a desert.

   5. They who sow in tears shall reap in joy. This sentence, in my
   opinion, ought not less to be extended to the future than understood of
   the past. The carrying away of the Jews into Babylon was to them as a
   seed-time; [94] God having, by the prophecy of Jeremiah, encouraged
   them to hope for the harvest. Still, it was not without very great
   heaviness and anguish of heart that they were dragged into such long
   continued captivity. It was, as if in the time of dearth the poor
   husbandman, who already experiences the gnawings of hunger, were
   compelled to abridge himself of his ordinary food in order to provide
   for the coming year; and although this is a hard and distressing case,
   he is yet moved to sow from the hope of the harvest. The Jews then,
   when led into captivity, were, doubtless, no less sorrowful than he
   who, in the time of scarcity, casts the precious seed into the ground;
   but afterwards a joyful harvest followed, when they were delivered; for
   the Lord restored to them gladness, like that which is experienced in a
   most abundant increase. [95] I, however, also conceive that the Prophet
   exhorts the faithful to patience in reference to the future. The
   restoration of the Church was not yet completed, and even, for the two
   reasons which I have a little before specified, that period was
   evidently the time of sowing. Although the edict of the king frankly
   invited the Jews to return, yet only a few of many returned, gradually
   and fearfully, in small companies. Moreover, those who did so were
   unkindly and harshly welcomed by their neighbors, and to so much
   trouble were they subjected that their former bondage appeared equally
   tolerable. Whence we gather, that they had still to suffer -- the full
   time of harvest, not having yet arrived; and, therefore, the Prophet,
   not without cause, exhorts them strenuously to labor, and to persevere
   in the midst of continual difficulties without fainting, until they
   found themselves placed in more favorable circumstances. With respect
   to the words, some translate. msk, meshech, a price; and others, a
   basket or seed vessel. [96] For the latter translation there is no
   foundation. Those who translate price quote in support of their version
   that passage in the book of Job 28:18 "The price of wisdom is above
   rubies." But as the verb msk, mashach, from which this noun is derived,
   signifies to extend or to draw out, it may perhaps, both here and in
   that other place, be more fitly taken in its proper signification. In
   the text quoted from Job it is profound wisdom, and not intellectual
   acuteness, which is commended, and thus the extending of wisdom, that
   is to say, a continual course of wisdom, is, from its being deeply
   grounded, better than pearls. In like manner, in the passage before us,
   the drawing out of the seed is applied to the husbandmen themselves,
   implying, that they extend and prolong their life when they sow. If,
   however, the word price is preferred, the sense will be, that when corn
   is scarce, seed is committed to the ground with tears, because it is
   precious and costly. This doctrine extends still farther. Our life is,
   in other parts of Scripture, compared to the seed-time, and as it will
   often happen that we must sow in tears, it becomes us, lest sorrow
   should weaken or slacken our diligence, to raise our minds to the hope
   of the harvest. Besides, let us remember that all the Jews who were
   carried captives into Babylon did not sow; for as really among them,
   who had hardened themselves against God and the Prophets, had despised
   all threatenings, so they lost all hope of returning. Those in whom
   such despair brooded were consumed in their miseries; but those who
   were sustained by the promise of God, cherished in their hearts the
   hope of harvest, although in a time, of extreme scarcity they cast
   their seed into the ground, as it were, at venture. In order then that
   joy may succeed our present sorrow, let us learn to apply our minds to
   the contemplation of the issue which God promises. Thus we shall
   experience that all true believers have a common interest in this
   prophecy, That God not only will wipe away tears from their eyes, but
   that he will also diffuse inconceivable joy through their hearts.

   [90] Walford reads, "Bring back all our captives, O Jehovah!" "The word
   all," says he, "is not in the Hebrew text, but is necessary to the
   sense; for some had returned, and others were returning or about to
   return." Some of the captive Jews came back to their own land in the
   reign of Cyrus, others in the reign of Darius, and the rest in the
   reign of Xerxes. Such therefore as had been the first to return, may be
   supposed to pray in these words for the restoration of their brethren.

   [91] Phillips translates in the dry place. "The noun ngv," says he, "in
   its usual acceptation, signifies south; but its primary sense is that
   of dryness, in which it is used in Joshua 15:19; Judges 1:15; where
   'rts hngv is opposed to glt mvm, springs of water." In the Septuagint
   the reading is, like the torrents m the parched land.' Street has --
   "Jehovah hath restored us from our captivity,
   As he restoreth the torrents in the dry country." French and Skinner in
   like manner read "in a thirsty land."

   [92] "Precaria libertas." -- Lat. "Ceste liberte obtenue d'eux par le
   bon plaisir du Roy." -- Fr.

   [93] Walford reads, "like the streams of the south." -- "In the
   southern districts of Palestine and Arabia," says he, "the heat is so
   vehement during some seasons as to dry up the rivers completely, and
   parch the soil. When rains come, the torrents again flow, and the soil
   is refreshed and verdant; -- a delightful image of the joy experienced
   by captives on returning to their native land."

   [95] The word then may be prefixed to this verse: then, ie., when thou
   hast brought back the captives, they that sowed in tears shall reap in
   joy." -- Cresswell.

   [96] "msk. This word has been variously interpreted; for as it is found
   only here and in Job 28:18, its signification is uncertain. In the
   Syriac we have it rendered by a word which signifies a skin and hence
   J. D. Michaelis proposes to take msk for a sack made of skin. So Aben
   Ezra thinks that it is the name of a measure in which there is seed.'
   The author of Mendlessohn's Beor, approves of this comment, and
   observes, that msk was a small cup made of skin.' The root is msk, to
   draw out.' We should, however, adhere as strictly to the meaning of the
   root if we render the expression as Gesenius has done, by the drawing
   of the seed, i.e., the strewing or sowing of the seed. I think,
   however, Michaelis's rendering is the best, as fitting with the
   preceding word gs'; and so we have carrying the sack of seed, at the
   end of the first hemistich, which corresponds with carrying his sheaves
   at the end of the second." -- Phillips. On the margin of our English
   Bible it is "seed-basket." Street reads, "Bearing the vessel with the
   seed;" Horsley, "He that goeth, and weeping beareth the seed to be
   drawn forth; French and Skinner, "Bearing seed for his sowing;" Fry,
   "Sowing his seed," observing, that msk expresses the action of casting
   the seed into the ground; and Walford, "Carrying seed for sowing."
   "Literally it is," says Cresswell, "a drawing forth of seed, i.e., as
   much as the sower, putting his hand into whatever contained the seed,
   could take out at once. Amos 9:13."

   PSALM 127

   This Psalm shows that the order of society, both political and
   domestic, is maintained solely by the blessing of God, and not by the
   policy, diligence, or wisdom of men; and that the procreating of
   children is his peculiar gift.

   A Song of Degrees of Solomon.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 127:1-2

   1. [97] Except Jehovah build the house, those who build it labor in
   vain except Jehovah keep the city the watchman watcheth in vain. 2. It
   is in vain for you in hastening to rise early, to go late to rest, to
   eat the bread of sorrows: for [98] thus will he give sleep to his
   beloved.


   1. Except Jehovah build the house. There is no reason why the Jews
   should deny that this Psalm was composed by Solomon. They think that
   the letter l, lamed, which we translate of, is equivalent to, in behalf
   of Solomon; which is at variance with common usage, for such a title in
   all cases designates the author. Accordingly, they absurdly devise a
   new sense, for which there is no necessity, it being very suitable for
   Solomon, who was endued with the spirit of wisdom in the affairs of
   government, to discourse of things which he knew and had experience
   about. In affirming that God governs the world and the life of man, he
   does so for two reasons: First, whatever prosperous event may fall out
   to men, their ingratitude is instantly manifested by their ascribing it
   wholly to themselves; and thus God is defrauded of the honor which is
   his due. Solomon, to correct such a perverse error, declares, that
   nothing happens prosperously to us except in so far as God blesses our
   proceedings. Secondly, his purpose was to beat down the foolish
   presumption of men, who, setting God aside, are not afraid to undertake
   to do anything, whatever it may be, in exclusive reliance upon their
   own wisdom and strength. Stripping them, therefore, of that which they
   groundlessly arrogate to themselves, he exhorts them to modesty and the
   invocation of God. He does not, however, reject either the labor, the
   enterprises, or the counsels of men; for it is a praiseworthy virtue
   diligently to discharge the duties of our office. It is not the will of
   the Lord that we should be like blocks of wood, or that we should keep
   our arms folded without doing anything; [99] but that we should apply
   to use all the talents and advantages which he has conferred upon us.
   It is indeed true that the greatest part of our labors proceeds from
   the curse of God; and yet although men had still retained the integrity
   of their primitive state, God would have had us to be employed, even as
   we see how Adam was placed in the garden of Eden to dress it. (Genesis
   2:15.) Solomon, therefore, does not condemn watchfulness, a thing which
   God approves; nor yet men's labor, by which when they undertake it
   willingly, according to the commandment of God, they offer to him all
   acceptable sacrifice; but lest, blinded by presumption, they should
   forcibly appropriate to themselves that which belongs to God, he
   admonishes them that their being busily occupied will profit them
   nothing, except in so far as God blesses their exertions. By the word
   house he means not only a building of wood or stone, but he comprehends
   the whole domestic order and government of a family, even as a little
   after by the word city he denotes not only the buildings or enclosure
   of the walls, but also the general state of the whole commonwealth.
   There is likewise a synecdoche in the words builder and keeper; for he
   intends to say in general that whatever labor, foresight, and skill men
   may employ in maintaining a family, or in preserving a city, will be to
   no purpose unless God grant from heaven a prosperous issue to the
   whole.

   It behoves us to remember what I have just now touched upon, that since
   the minds of men are commonly possessed with such headstrong arrogance
   as leads them to despise God, and to magnify beyond measure their own
   means and advantages, nothing is of more importance than to humble
   them, in order to their being made to perceive that whatever they
   undertake it shall dissolve into smoke, unless God in the exercise of
   pure grace cause it to prosper. When philosophers argue concerning the
   political affairs of a state they ingeniously gather together whatever
   seems to them to answer their purpose -- they acutely point out the
   means of erecting a commonwealth, and on the other hand the vices by
   which a well-regulated state is commonly corrupted; in short, they
   discourse with consummate skill upon everything that is necessary to be
   known on this subject, except that they omit the principal point --
   which is, that men, however much they may excel in wisdom and virtue,
   and whatever may be the undertakings in which they may engage, can
   effect nothing, unless in so far as God stretches forth his hand to
   them, or rather makes use of them as his instruments. Which of the
   philosophers ever acknowledged that a politician is nothing else but an
   instrument guided by the hand of God? Yea, rather they held that good
   management on the part of man constituted the chief cause of the
   happiness of the social body. Now, since mortal men thus rise up with
   profane boldness to build cities, and to order the state of the whole
   world, the Holy Spirit justly reproves such madness. Let us then so
   occupy ourselves, each according to the measure of his ability and the
   nature of his office, as that at the same time the praise of the
   success attending our exertions may remain exclusively with God. The
   partition which many devise -- that he who has behaved himself
   valiantly, while he leaves the half of the praise to God, may take the
   other half to himself, is deserving of all condemnation. The blessing
   of God should have the whole share and exclusively hold the throne.

   Now, if our terrestrial condition depends entirely upon the good
   pleasure of God, with what wings shall we fly up into heaven? When a
   house is planned, or a certain manner of life is chosen -- yea, even
   when laws are enacted and justice administered, all this is nothing
   else than to creep upon the earth; and yet the Holy Spirit declares,
   that all our endeavors in this way are fruitless and of no value. So
   much the less to be borne with, then, is the folly of those who strive
   to penetrate even into heaven by their own power. Farther, we may
   gather from this doctrine, that it is not wonderful to find in the
   present day the state of the world so troubled and confused as it
   actually is -- justice put to flight in cities, the husband and the
   wife mutually accusing each other, fathers and mothers complaining of
   their children -- in short, all bewailing their own condition. For how
   few are to be found who, in their vocation, turn to God, and who, being
   rather inflated with arrogance, do not wickedly exalt themselves? God
   then justly renders this sad reward to ungrateful men when he is
   defrauded of his honor. But were all men humbly to submit themselves to
   the providence of God, there is no doubt that this blessing which
   Solomon here commends would shed its lustre on all parts of our life,
   both public and private.

   The verb ml, amal, which we have translated to labor, signifies not
   only to employ one's self in something or other, but also to busy one's
   self even to lassitude and distress. I have said that by the word
   keepers is to be understood not only those who are appointed to keep
   watch, but all magistrates and judges. If they are characterized by
   vigilance, it is the gift of God. There is, however, need of another
   vigilance -- that of God; for unless he keep watch out of heaven no
   perspicacity of men will be sufficient to guard against dangers.

   2. It is vain for you in hastening to rise early. Solomon now expresses
   more plainly that men in vain wear themselves out with toiling, and
   waste themselves by fasting to acquire riches, since these also are a
   benefit bestowed only by God. The more effectually to move them, he
   addresses himself to every man in particular. It is, says he, in vain
   for you He particularizes two means which are thought to contribute in
   an eminent degree to the amassing of riches. It is not surprising to
   find those growing rich in a short time who spare no exertion, but
   consume night and day in plying their occupations, and allow themselves
   only scanty fare from the product of their labor. Solomon, however,
   affirms that neither living at a small expense, nor diligence in
   business will by themselves profit anything at all. Not that he forbids
   us to practice temperance in our diet and to rise early to engage in
   our worldly business; but to stir us up to prayer, and to calling upon
   God, and also to recommend gratitude for the divine blessings, he
   brings to nought whatever would obscure the grace of God. Consequently,
   we shall then enter upon our worldly avocations in a right way when our
   hope depends exclusively upon God, and our success in that case will
   correspond to our wishes. But if a man, taking no account of God,
   eagerly makes haste, he will bring ruin upon himself by his too
   precipitate course. It is not, therefore, the design of the Prophet to
   encourage men to give way to sloth, so that they should think upon
   nothing all their life long, but fall asleep and abandon themselves to
   idleness- his meaning rather is, that, in executing what God has
   enjoined upon them, they should always begin with prayer and calling
   upon his name, offering to him their labors that he may bless them. The
   expression, the bread of sorrows, may be explained in two ways, either
   as denoting what is acquired by hard and anxious toil, or what is eaten
   with disquietude of mind; just as we see parsimonious and close-handed
   persons, when they have scarcely tasted a bit of bread, pulling back
   their hand from their mouth. It is of no great importance which of
   these senses is adopted; for we are simply taught that parsimonious men
   profit nothing -- no not even when through their own niggardliness they
   grudge to eat as much as nature requires.

   For thus will he give sleep to his beloved. The inspired writer
   intimates that the blessing of God, of which he has spoken, is actually
   seen in his children and servants. It will not suffice to believe this
   doctrine -- that whatever, men attempt is to no purpose; it is
   necessary that the promise be added, in order to their being led with
   assured hope to perform their duty. The sentence may be read either --
   he will give sleep to his beloved, or, he will give in sleeping; that
   is, he will give them those things which unbelievers labor to acquire
   by their own industry. The particle, kn, ken, thus, is put to express
   certainty; [100] for with the view of producing a more undoubted
   persuasion of the truth -- that God gives food to his people without
   any great care on their part -- which seems incredible, and a fiction,
   Solomon points to the thing as it were with the finger. He indeed
   speaks as if God nourished the slothfulness of his servants by his
   gentle treatment; but as we know that men are created with the design
   of their being occupied, and as in the subsequent Psalm we shall find
   that the servants of God are accounted happy when they eat the labor of
   their hands, it is certain that the word sleep is not to be understood
   as implying slothfulness, but a placid labor, to which true believers
   subject themselves by the obedience of faith. Whence proceeds this so
   great ardor in the unbelieving, that they move not a finger without a
   tumult or bustle, in other words, without tormenting themselves with
   superfluous cares, but because they attribute nothing to the providence
   of God! The faithful, on the other hand, although they lead a laborious
   life, yet follow their vocations with composed and tranquil minds. Thus
   their hands are not idle, but their minds repose in the stillness of
   faith, as if they were asleep. If it is again objected, that God's
   people are often agitated with distressing cares, and that, oppressed
   with pinching poverty, and destitute of all resources, they are
   anxiously concerned about the morrow, I answer, that if faith and love
   to God were perfect in his servants, his blessing, of which the Prophet
   makes mention, would be manifest. Whenever they are tormented above
   measure, this happens through their own default, in not resting
   entirely upon the providence of God. I farther add, that God punishes
   them more severely than unbelievers, because it is profitable for them
   to be agitated by disquietude for a season, that at length they may
   attain to this peaceful sleep. In the meantime, however, God's grace
   prevails, and always shines forth in the midst of darkness, in respect
   of his cherishing his children as it were by sleep.

   Psalm 127:3-5

   3. Lo! children are the heritage of Jehovah: the fruit of the womb is
   the reward which he bestows. [101] 4. As arrows in, the hand of a
   strong man so are the children of youth. [102] 5. Blessed is the man
   who shall have filled his quiver with them; for [103] they shall not be
   ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the gate.


   3. Lo! children are the heritage of Jehovah. Solomon here adduces one
   instance in which, in a particular manner, he would have us to
   recognize the truth which he has hitherto asserted generally -- that
   the life of men is governed by God. Nothing seems more natural than for
   men to be produced of men. The majority of mankind dream, that after
   God had once ordained this at the beginning, children were thenceforth
   begotten solely by a secret instinct of nature, God ceasing to
   interfere in the matter; and even those who are endued with some sense
   of piety, although they may not deny that He is the Father and Creator
   of the human race, yet do not acknowledge that his providential care
   descends to this particular case, but rather think that men are created
   by a certain universal motion. With the view of correcting this
   preposterous error, Solomon calls children the heritage of God, and the
   fruit of the womb his gift; for the Hebrew word skr, sachar, translated
   reward, signifies whatever benefits God bestows upon men, as is plainly
   manifest from many passages of Scripture. The meaning then is, that,
   children are not the fruit of chance, but that God, as it seems good to
   him, distributes to every man his share of them. Moreover, as the
   Prophet repeats the same thing twice, heritage and reward are to be
   understood as equivalent; for both these terms are set in opposition to
   fortune, or the strength of men. The stronger a man is he seems so much
   the better fitted for procreation. Solomon declares on the contrary,
   that those become fathers to whom God vouchsafes that honor.

   As the majority of children are not always a source of joy to their
   parents, a second favor of God is added, which is his forming the minds
   of children, and adorning them with an excellent disposition, and all
   kinds of virtues. Aristotle in his Politics very properly discusses the
   question whether poluteknia, that is, the having of many children,
   ought to be accounted among good things or no; and he decides it in the
   negative, unless there is added eugeneia, that is, generosity or
   goodness of nature in the children themselves. And assuredly it would
   be a far happier lot for many to be without children, or barren, than
   to have a numerous offspring, proving to them only the cause of tears
   and groans. In order, then, to set forth this blessing of God -- the
   having offspring -- in a clear light, Solomon commends a virtuous and
   generous disposition in children. The similitude introduced for this
   purpose is, that as an archer is armed with a well-furnished bow, so
   men are defended by their children, as it were with a bow and all
   arrow. This similitude might seem, at first sight, a little too harsh;
   but if it is examined somewhat more closely, its elegance will be
   readily admitted. The Prophet means that those who are without children
   are in a manner unarmed; for what else is it to be childless but to be
   solitary? It is no small gift of God for a man to be renewed in his
   posterity; for God then gives him new strength, that he who otherwise
   would straightway decay, may begin as it were to live a second time.

   The knowledge of this doctrine is highly useful. The fruitfulness even
   of the lower animals is expressly ascribed to God alone; and if He
   would have it to be accounted his benefit that kine, and sheep, and
   mares conceive, how inexcusable will be the impiety of men, if when he
   adorns them with the honorable title of fathers, they account this
   favor as nothing. It is also to be added, that unless men regard their
   children as the gift of God, they are careless and reluctant in
   providing for their support, just as on the other hand this knowledge
   contributes in a very eminent degree to encourage them in bringing up
   their offspring. Farther, he who thus reflects upon the goodness of God
   in giving him children, will readily and with a settled mind look for
   the continuance of God's grace; and although he may have but a small
   inheritance to leave them, he will not be unduly careful on that
   account.

   5. They shall not be ashamed when they speak with their enemies in the
   gate. Here Solomon describes such children as, distinguished by
   uprightness and integrity, have no hesitation in rendering an account
   of their life, that they may shut the mouths of the malevolent and of
   calumniators. In ancient times, as is well known, judicial assemblies
   [104] were held at the gates of cities. He therefore here speaks of the
   gate, as if in the present day one should speak of the bench, or the
   courts, or the senate. Let it be observed that what is chiefly praised
   in children is innocence, that fathers may estimate this grace at its
   true value. In the preceding clause he had compared children endued
   with virtue and excellence of nature to arrows. Now, that no man may
   put a violent construction upon this comparison, as if it were intended
   to give children leave, like robbers, to rush upon doing mischief to
   such as come in their way, reckless of right and wrong, he expressly
   represents virtue and moral integrity as constituting the protection
   which they ought to afford to their fathers. He teaches us, then, that
   the children which we ought to wish for, are not such as may violently
   oppress the wretched and suffering, or overreach others by craft and
   deceit, or accumulate great riches by unlawful means, or acquire for
   themselves tyrannical authority, but such as will practice uprightness,
   and be willing to live in obedience to the laws, and prepared to render
   an account of their life. Farther, although fathers ought diligently to
   form their children under a system of holy discipline, yet let them
   remember that they will never succeed in attaining the object aimed at,
   save by the pure and special grace of God. Solomon also tacitly
   intimates that however zealously we may be devoted to the practice of
   integrity, we shall never be without detractors and slanderers; for if
   integrity of life were exempt from all calumny, we would have no
   quarrel with our enemies.

   youths, as vny nkr mean strangers, (Psalm 18:45.) Either rendering, I
   apprehend, will be suitable on this occasion; for the object of the
   verse is doubtless to show, that a numerous progeny is a great blessing
   to a man, and an important addition to his strength and safety; that
   they will be a defence to him in a time of danger, and serve him to
   repel an enemy, as arrows do in the hand of a mighty man." -- Phillips.

   1. Blessed is the man who feareth Jehovah, and walketh in his ways. 2.
   For when thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands, thou shalt be blessed,
   and it shall be well with thee. 3. Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine
   on the sides of thy house, and thy children as olive plants around thy
   table. [105]


   1 Blessed is the man who feareth Jehovah. In the preceding Psalm it was
   stated that prosperity in all human affairs, and in the whole course of
   our life, is to be hoped for exclusively from the grace of God; and now
   the Prophet admonishes us that those who desire to be partakers of the
   blessing of God must with sincerity of heart devote themselves wholly
   to him; for he will never disappoint those who serve him. The first
   verse contains a summary of the subject-matter of the Psalm; the
   remaining portion being added only by way of exposition. The maxim
   "that those are blessed who fear God, especially in the present life,"
   is so much with variance with the common opinion of men, that very few
   will give it their assent. Everywhere are to be found fluttering about
   many Epicureans, similar to Dionysius, who, having once had a favorable
   wind upon the sea and a prosperous voyage, after having plundered a
   temple, [106] boasted that the gods favored church robbers. Also the
   weak are troubled and shaken by the prosperity of evil men, and they
   next faint under the load of their own miseries. The despisers of God
   may not indeed enjoy prosperity, and the condition of good men may be
   tolerable, but still the greater part of men are blind in considering
   the providence of God, or seem not in any degree to perceive it. The
   adage, "That it is best not to be born at all, or to die as soon as
   possible," has certainly been long since received by the common consent
   of almost all men. Finally, carnal reason judges either that all
   mankind without exception are miserable, or that fortune is more
   favorable to ungodly and wicked men than to the good. To the sentiment
   that those are blessed who fear the Lord, it has an entire aversion, as
   I have declared at length on [3]Psalm 37. So much the more requisite
   then is it to dwell upon the consideration of this truth. Farther, as
   this blessedness is not apparent to the eye, it is of importance, in
   order to our being able to apprehend it., first to attend to the
   definition which will be given of it by and bye, and secondly, to know
   that it depends chiefly upon the protection of God. Although we collect
   together all the circumstances which seem to contribute to a happy
   life, surely nothing will be found more desirable than to be kept
   hidden under the guardianship of God. If this blessing is, in our
   estimation, to be preferred, as it deserves, to all other good things,
   whoever is persuaded that the care of God is exercised about the world
   and human affairs, will at the same time unquestionably acknowledge
   that what is here laid down is the chief point of happiness.

   But before I proceed farther, it is to be noticed that in the second
   part of the verse there is with good reason added a mark by which the
   servants of God are distinguished from those who despise him. We see
   how the most depraved, with no less pride than audacity and mockery,
   boast of fearing God. The Prophet therefore requires the attestation of
   the life as to this; for these two things, the fear of God and the
   keeping of his law, are inseparable; and the root must necessarily
   produce its corresponding fruit. Farther, we learn from this passage
   that our life does not meet with the divine approbation, except it be
   framed according to the divine law. There is unquestionably no religion
   without the fear of God, and from this fear the Prophet represents our
   living according to the commandment and ordinance of God as proceeding.

   2. For when thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands thou shalt be
   blessed. Some divide this sentence into two members, reading these
   words, For thou shalt eat the labor of thy hands, as a distinct
   sentence, and then what follows, Thou shalt be blessed, as the
   beginning of a new sentence. I indeed grant that it is true, as they
   assert, that the grace of God, manifested in the faithful enjoying the
   fruits of their labor is set in opposition to the curse to which all
   mankind have been subjected. But it is more natural to read the words
   as one sentence, bringing out this meaning -- That God's children are
   happy in eating the fruits of their labor; for if we make them two
   sentences, these words, thou, shalt be blessed, and it shall be well
   with thee, would contain a cold and even an insipid repetition. Here
   the Prophet, confirming the doctrine stated in the first verse, teaches
   us that we ought to form a different estimate of what happiness
   consists hi from that formed by the world, which makes a happy life to
   consist in ease, honors, and great wealth. He recalls God's servants to
   the practice of moderation, which almost all men refuse to exercise.
   How few are to be found who, were it left to their own choice, would
   desire to live by their own labor; yea, who would account it a singular
   benefit to do so! No sooner is the name of happiness pronounced, than
   instantly every man breaks forth into the most extravagant ideas of
   what is necessary to it, so insatiable a gulf is the covetousness of
   the human heart. The Prophet therefore bids the fearers of God be
   content with this one thing -- with the assurance that having God for
   their foster-father, they shall be suitably maintained by the labor of
   their own hands; just as it is said in Psalm 34:10,

   "The young lions do lack, and suffer hunger; but they that seek the
   Lord shall not want any good thing."

   We must remember that the Prophet does not speak of the highest
   blessedness, which consists not in meat and drink, nor is confined
   within the narrow bounds of this transitory life; but he assures God's
   believing people that even in this pilgrimage or earthly place of
   sojourn they shall enjoy a happy life, in so far as the state of the
   world will permit; even as Paul declares that God promises both these
   to such as fear him, in other words, that God will take care of us
   during the whole course of our life, until he has at last brought us to
   eternal glory. (1 Timothy 4:8.) The change of person serves also to
   give greater emphasis to the language; for after having),' spoken in
   the third person, the Prophet comes to address his discourse to. each
   individual in particular, to this effect: -- Not only does immortal
   felicity await thee in heaven, but during thy pilgrimage in this world
   God will not cease to perform the office of the father of a family in
   maintaining thee, so that thy daily food will be administered to thee
   by his hand, provided thou art contented with a lowly condition.

   3 Thy wife shall be as a fruitful vine on the sides of thy house. Here
   again it is promised, as in the preceding Psalm, that God will make
   those who honor him fruitful in a numerous offspring. The majority of
   mankind indeed desire to have issue, and this desire may be said to be
   implanted in them by nature; but many, when they have obtained
   children, soon become cloyed therewith. Again it is often more grateful
   to want children than to leave a number of them in circumstances of
   destitution. But although the world is carried away by irregular
   desires after various objects, between which it is perpetually
   fluctuating in its choice, God gives this his own blessing, the
   preference to all riches, and therefore we ought to hold it in high
   estimation. If a man has a wife of amiable manners as the companion of
   his life, let him set no less value upon this blessing than Solomon
   did, who, in Proverbs 19:14, affirms that it is God alone who gives a
   good wife. In like manner, if a man be a father of a numerous
   offspring, let him receive that goodly boon with a thankful heart. If
   it is objected that the Prophet in speaking thus, detains the faithful
   on the earth by the allurements of the flesh, and hinders them from
   aspiring towards heaven with free and unencumbered minds, I answer,
   that it is not surprising to find him offering to the Jews under the
   law a taste of God's grace and paternal favor, when we consider that
   they were like children. He has, however, so tempered, or mixed it, as
   that by it; they might rise in their contemplations to the heavenly
   life. Even at the present day God, though in a more sparing manner,
   testifies his favor by temporal benefits, agreeably to that passage in
   Paul's first Epistle to Timothy just now quoted, (1 Timothy 4:8,)

   "Godliness is profitable unto all things, having promise of the life
   that now is, and of that which is to come."

   But by this he does not cast any hindrance or impediment in our way to
   keep us from elevating our minds to heaven, but ladders are by this
   means rather erected to enable us to mount up thither step by step. The
   Prophet, therefore, very properly reminds the faithful that they
   already receive some fruit of their integrity, when God gives them
   their food, makes them happy in their wives and children, and
   condescends to take care of their life. But his design in commending
   the present goodness of God is to animate them to hasten forward with
   alacrity on the path which leads to their eternal inheritance. If the
   earthly felicity described in this Psalm may not always be the lot of
   the godly, but should it sometimes happen that their wife is a
   termagant, or proud, or of depraved morals, or that their children are
   dissolute and vagabonds, and even bring disgrace upon their father's
   house, let them know that their being deprived of God's blessing is
   owing to their having repulsed it by their own fault. And surely if
   each duly considers his own vices he will acknowledge that God's
   earthly benefits have been justly withheld from him.

   [105] "The tables of the Jews, as we may hence (and from 1 Samuel
   16:11) infer, were round: they had sobs (Ezekiel 23:41) placed about
   them, on which (Genesis 27:19; Judges 10:6; 1 Samuel 2:5, 24, 25; 1
   Kings 13:20) they sat, excepting at the Paschal feast." -- Cresswell.
   In the Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible, the writer on this
   passage objects to the common reading -- Fruitful vine by the sides of
   thine house. olive-plants round about thy table. "We do not remember,"
   says he, "to have met with a single instance in the East of vines
   trained against the walls of a house, or of olives near or about a
   house. Neither have we read of such instances. The passage doubtless
   derives its figures from the fertility of the vine, and from the
   appearance of the olive, or the order in which olive-trees are
   planted." He accordingly proposes the following construction -- "Thy
   wife, on the sides (interior apartments) of thy house, shall be as the
   fruitful vine; and thy children, round about thy table, like
   olive-plants."

   Psalm 128:4-6

   4. Lo! surely, thus blessed shall be the man who feareth Jehovah. 5.
   Jehovah shall bless thee from Zion; and thou shalt see the good of
   Jerusalem all the days of thy life: 6. And thou shalt see thy
   children's children, and peace upon Israel.


   4. Lo! surely, thus blessed shall be the man who feareth Jehovah. The
   preceding doctrine, that even in the outward condition of God's
   servants while in this transitory state there is afforded such evidence
   of the divine favor and goodness as demonstrates that we do not lose
   our labor in serving him, is here confirmed by the Prophet. Yet as the
   reward of godliness does not appear eminently conspicuous, he, in the
   first place, uses the demonstrative particle, Lo! [107] and then adds
   surely; for so I interpret the particle ky, ki. We must, however,
   always remember, as I have previously noticed, that the divine blessing
   is promised to us upon earth in such a way as that it may not engross
   our thoughts and keep them grovelling in the dust; for it is not meet
   that our hope of the life to come should be stifled. This is the reason
   why we do not at all times equally enjoy the benefits of God.

   5. Jehovah shall bless thee from Zion. Some, would have this sentence
   to be a prayer, and therefore they resolve the future tense into the
   optative mood. But it seems rather to be a continued statement of the
   same doctrine previously dwelt on, the Prophet now expressing more
   plainly that the benefits which he has recounted are to be ascribed to
   God as their author. Although the gifts of God often present themselves
   before our eyes, yet through the obscurity which false imaginations
   throw around them our perception of them is dim and imperfect. Hence
   this repetition of the sentiment, That whenever true believers meet
   with any prosperous events in the course of their life, it is the
   effect of the divine blessing, is not to be deemed superfluous. The
   persons described are said to be blessed from Zion, to lead them to
   call to remembrance the covenant into which God had entered with them,
   for he had graciously promised to be favorable to the observers of his
   law; and these principles of godliness they had imbibed from their
   infancy. The Prophet, therefore, declares that it is no novel doctrine
   or something before unheard of which he adduces, the law having long
   ago taught them that it is made manifest even by the temporary benefits
   conferred on those who serve God, that the pains taken in serving him
   are not thrown away; and he affirms that of this they shall actually
   have the experience. What is added concerning the good of Jerusalem is
   to be regarded as en-joining upon the godly the duty not only of
   seeking their own individual welfare, or of being devoted to their own
   peculiar interests, but rather of having it as chief desire to see the
   Church of God in a flourishing condition. It would be a very
   unreasonable thing for each member to desire what may be profitable for
   itself, while in the meantime the body was neglected. From our extreme
   proneness to err in that respect, the Prophet, with good reason,
   recommends solicitude about the public welfare; and he mingles together
   domestic blessings and the common benefits of the Church in such a way
   as to show us that they are things joined together, and which it is
   unlawful to put asunder.

   PSALM 129

   This Psalm teaches, in the first place, that God subjects his Church to
   divers troubles and affections, to the end he may the better prove
   himself her deliverer and defender. The Psalmist, therefore, recalls to
   the memory of the faithful how sadly God's people had been persecuted
   in all ages, and how wonderfully they had been preserved, in order by
   such examples to fortify their hope in reference to the future. In the
   second part, under the form of an imprecation, he shows that the divine
   vengeance is ready to fall upon all the ungodly, who without cause
   distress the people of God.

   A Song of Degrees.

   Psalm 129:1-4

   1. They have often afflicted me from my youth, let Israel now say: 2.
   They have often afflicted me from my youth; but they have not prevailed
   against me. 3. The ploughers have plouched upon my back, and made long
   their furrows. [108] 4. But Jehovah who is righteous, hath cut asunder
   the cords of the wicked.


   1. They have often afflicted me from my youth. This Psalm was probably
   composed at a time when the Church of God, reduced to a state of
   extreme distress, or dismayed by some great danger, or oppressed with
   tyranny, was on the verge of total destruction. This conjecture, I
   conceive, is supported by the adverb of time, now, which appears to me
   to be emphatic. It is as if the Prophet; had said, When God's faithful
   ones are with difficulty drawing their breath under the burden of
   temptations, it is a seasonable time for them to reflect on the manner
   in which he has exercised his people from the beginning, and from age
   to age. As soon as God has given loose reins to our enemies to do as
   they please we are distressed with sorrow, and our thoughts are wholly
   engrossed with the evils which presently harass us. Hence proceeds
   despair; for we do not remember that the patience of the fathers was
   subjected to the like trial, and that nothing happens to us which they
   did not experience. It is then an exercise eminently fitted to comfort
   true believers to look back to the conflicts of the Church in the days
   of old, in order thereby to know that she has always labored under the
   cross, and has been severely afflicted by the unrighteous violence of
   her enemies. The most probable conjecture which occurs to me at present
   is, that this Psalm was written after the Jews had returned from the
   Babylonish captivity, and when, having suffered many grievous and cruel
   injuries at the hands of their neighbors, they hadn't length almost
   fainted under the tyranny of Antiochus Epiphanes. In this dark and
   troublous state of matters, the Prophet encourages the faithful to
   fortitude, nor does he address himself to a few of them only, but to
   the whole body without exception; and in order to their sustaining such
   fierce assaults, he would have them to oppose to them a hope inspired
   by the encouraging consideration, that the Church, by patient
   endurance, has uniformly proved victorious. Almost every word is
   emphatic. Let Israel now say, that is, let him consider the trials of
   the Church in ancient times, from which it may be gathered, that the
   people of God have never been exempted from bearing the cross, and yet
   that the various afflictions by which they have been tried have always
   had a happy issue. In speaking of the enemies of Israel simply by the
   pronoun they, without being more specific, the Psalmist aggravates the
   greatness of the evil more than if he had expressly named the Assyrians
   or the Egyptians. By not specifying any particular class of foes, he
   tacitly intimates that the world is fraught with innumerable bands of
   enemies, whom Satan easily arms for the destruction of good men, his
   object being that new wars may arise continually on every side. History
   certainly bears ample testimony that the people of God had not to deal
   with a few enemies, but that they were assaulted by almost the whole
   world; and farther, that they were molested not only by external foes,
   but also by those of an internal kind, by such as professed to belong
   to the Church.

   The term youth here denotes their first beginnings, [109] and refers
   not only to the time when God brought the people out of Egypt, but also
   to the time when he wearied Abraham and the patriarchs during almost
   their whole life, by keeping them in a condition of painful warfare. If
   these patriarchs were strangely driven about in the land of Canaan, the
   lot of their descendants was still worse during the time of their
   sojourning in Egypt, when they were not only oppressed as slaves, but
   loaded with every kind of reproach and ignominy. At their departure
   from that land we know what difficulties they had to encounter. If in
   tracing their history from that period we find seasons in which some
   respite was granted them, yet they were not in a state of repose for
   any length of time, until the reign of David. And although during his
   reign they appeared to be in a prosperous condition, yet soon after
   troubles and even defeats arose, which threatened the people of God
   with total destruction. In the Babylonish captivity, all hope being
   well-nigh extinguished, they seemed as if hidden in the grave and
   undergoing the process of putrefaction. After their return they
   obtained, with difficulty, some brief intermission to take their
   breath. They were certainly often put; to the sword, until the race of
   them was almost wholly destroyed. To prevent it, therefore, from being
   supposed that they had received only some slight hurt, they are justly
   said to have been afflicted; as if the Prophet placed them before our
   eyes as it were half-dead, through the treatment of their enemies, who,
   seeing them prostrated under their feet, scrupled not to tread upon
   them. If we come to ourselves, it will be proper to add the horrible
   persecutions, by which the Church would have been consumed a thousand
   times, had not God, by hidden and mysterious means, preserved her,
   raising her as it were from the dead. Unless we have become stupid
   under our calamities, the distressing circumstances of this unhappy age
   will compel us to meditate on the same doctrine.

   When the Prophet says twice, they have afflicted me, they have
   afflicted me, the repetition is not superfluous, it being intended to
   teach us that the people of God had not merely once or twice to enter
   the conflict, but that their patience had been tried by continual
   exercises. He had said that they had commenced this conflict from their
   youth, intimating that they had been inured to it from their first
   origin, in order to their being accustomed to bear the cross. He now
   adds, that their being subjected to this rigorous training was not
   without good reason, inasmuch as God had not ceased, by a continued
   course, to make use of these calamities for subduing them to himself.
   If the exercises of the Church, during her state of childhood, were so
   severe, our effeminacy will be very shameful indeed, if in the present
   day, when the Church, by the coming of Christ, has reached the age of
   manhood, we are found wanting in firmness for enduring trials. Matter
   of consolation is laid down in the last clause, which informs us that
   the enemies of Israel, after having tried all methods, never succeeded
   in realizing their wishes, God having always disappointed their hopes,
   and baffled their attempts.

   3. The ploughers have ploughed upon my back. [110] Here the Prophet, by
   an apparent similitude, embellishes his preceding statement respecting
   the grievous afflictions of the Church. He compares the people of God
   to a field through which a plough is drawn. He says that the furrows
   were made long, so that no corner was exempted from being cut up by the
   ploughshare. These words vividly express the fact -- that the cross has
   always been planted on the back of the Church, to make long and wide
   furrows.

   In the subsequent verse a ground of consolation under the same figure
   is subjoined, which is, that the righteous Lord hath cut asunder the
   cords of the wicked The allusion is to a plough, which, as we all know,
   is tied with cords to the necks of the oxen. The language very aptly
   conveys the idea, that the wicked, -- since they would never have
   become tired or satiated in exercising their cruelty, and also in
   consequence of their being well armed, -- were prepared to proceed
   farther, but that the Lord, in a way altogether unexpected, repressed
   their fury, just as if a man should unyoke oxen from the plough by
   cutting in pieces the cords and thongs which tied them to it. Hence we
   perceive what is the true condition of the Church. As God would have us
   contentedly to take his yoke upon us, the Holy Spirit not unfitly
   compares us to an arable field, which cannot make any resistance to its
   being cut, and cleaved, and turned up by the ploughshare. Should any
   one be disposed to indulge in greater refinement of speculation, he
   might say that the field is ploughed to prepare it for receiving the
   seed, and that it may at length bring forth fruit. But in my opinion
   the subject to which the Prophet limits his attention is the
   afflictions of the Church. The epithet righteous, with which he honors
   God, must, in a suitableness to the scope of the passage, be explained
   as implying that, although God may seem to dissemble for a time, yet he
   never forgets his righteousness, so as to withhold relief from his
   afflicted people. Paul in like manner adduces the same reason why God
   will not always suffer them to be persecuted,

   "Seeing it is a righteous thing with God to recompense tribulation to
   them that trouble you;
   and to you who are troubled rest with us." (2 Thessalonians 1:6, 7,)

   It is a point worthy of special notice, that the welfare of the Church
   is inseparably connected with the righteousness of God. The Prophet,
   also, wisely teaches us that the reason why the enemies of the Church
   did not prevail, was because God brought to nothing their enterprises,
   and did not suffer them to go beyond what he had determined in his own
   mind.

   [108] "Targ. lengthened out their ploughing, i.e., gave us no rest from
   their slavery, for the longer the furrows the more tedious is the labor
   of the oxen." -- Bythner.

   [109] Hence it is said in Hosea 11:1 -- "When Israel was a child, then
   I loved him,
   and called my son out of Egypt." Youth is in like manner ascribed to a
   people, in Isaiah 47:12, 15; Jeremiah 48:11; and Ezekiel 16:43.

   [110] According to Archbishop Seeker, this refers to severe scourging;
   and those who have witnessed this cruel infliction tell us that the
   allusion is most expressive, the long weals or wounds left by the
   scourges at each stroke being most aptly compared either to furrows, or
   (as the original admits) to the ridges between the furrows. With
   respect to the alleged incongruity of ploughing, and making long
   furrows on the back, the Archbishop observes, "Lacerare et secare
   tercum are Latin phrases, and ploughing is not much stronger, to
   express a severe scourging." The language of the Psalmist may, however,
   without allusion to any particular species of persecuting violence, be,
   as Calvin understands it, simply a strong image of cruel oppression.
   "The persecutors of Israel," says Walford, "are compared to ploughmen;
   because as they cut up, and as it were torture the surface of the
   earth, so did the adversaries greatly and grievously distress these
   afflicted people."

   Psalm 129:5-8

   5. All who hate Zion shall be confounded, and turned backward. 6. They
   shall be as the grass [111] of the housetops', which is withered before
   it comes forth: 7. With which the mower hath not filled his hand, nor
   the gleaner his bosom. [112] 8. Neither have they who pass by said,
   The blessing of Jehovah be upon you: we bless you in the name of
   Jehovah. [113]


   5. All who hate Zion shall be confounded, and tutored backward. Whether
   we take this as a prayer or a promise, the Prophet has a respect to the
   time to come. Since all the verbs are in the future tense, it is
   certainly a very appropriate interpretation to understand him as
   deriving from times past instruction as to what is to be hoped for in
   future, even to the end. In whichever way we understand the passage, he
   declares that the faithful have no reason to be discouraged when they
   behold their enemies raised on high. The grass which grows upon the
   house-tops is not, on account of its higher situation, more valuable
   than the blade of corn which in the low ground is trampled under foot;
   for although it stands elevated above men's heads, it is, in the first
   place, unprofitable; and secondly, it quickly withers away. [114] The
   verb, phls, shalaph, [115] which we have translate comes forth, is by
   some rendered, is plucked up. According to this translation the sense
   is, that without the hand or labor of man the grass on the house-tops
   is dried up. But as the verb properly signifies to be brought forth, or
   to come forth, the meaning, in my opinion, is that the grass on the
   housetops, so far from continuing long in a state of freshness, withers
   and perishes at its first springing up, because it has no root under
   it, nor earth to supply it with sap or moisture for its nourishment.
   Whenever, then, the splendor or greatness of our enemies strikes us
   with fear, let us bring to our recollection this comparison, that as
   the grass which grows upon the house-tops, though high, is yet without
   root, and consequently of brief duration, so these enemies, the nearer
   they approach the sun by the height of their pride, shall be the sooner
   consumed by the burning heat, since they have no root, it being
   humility alone which draws life and vigor from God.

   7 With which the mower hath not filled his hand. [116] We have here an
   additional confirmation of the truth, that although the wicked mount
   high or elevate themselves, and form an extravagant opinion of their
   own importance, yet they continue mere grass, not bringing forth any
   good fruit, nor reaching a state of ripeness, but swelling only with
   fresh appearance. To make this obvious, the Psalmist sets them in
   opposition to fruit-bearing herbs, which in valleys and low grounds
   produce fruit for men. In fine, he affirms that they deserve to be
   hated or despised of all, whereas commonly every one in passing by the
   corn fields blesses them and prays for the harvest? [117] Farther, he
   has borrowed this illustration of his doctrine from the affairs of
   ordinary life, we are taught that whenever there is a hopeful prospect
   of a good harvest, we ought to beseech God, whose peculiar province it
   is to impart fertility to the earth, that he would give full effect to
   his blessing. And considering that the fruits of the earth are exposed
   to so many hazards, it is certainly strange that we are not stirred up
   to engage in the exercise of prayer from the absolute necessity of
   these to man and beast. Nor does the Psalmist, in speaking of passers
   by blessing the reapers, speak exclusively of rite children of God, who
   are truly taught by his word that the fruitfulness of the earth is
   owing to his goodness; but he also comprehends worldly men in whom the
   same knowledge is implanted naturally. In conclusion, provided we not
   only dwell in the Church of the Lord, but also labor to have place
   among the number of her genuine citizens, we will be able fearlessly to
   despise all fire might of our enemies; for although they may flourish
   and have a great outward show for a time, yet they are but barren
   grass, on which the curse of heaven rests.

   PSALM 130

   Whether the Prophet in this Psalm prays in his own name in particular,
   or represents the whole Church, it is manifest, that finding himself
   overwhelmed with adversities, he supplicates deliverance with
   passionate ardor. And while acknowledging that he is justly chastised
   by the hand of God, he encourages himself and all genuine believers to
   cherish good hope, since God is the everlasting deliverer of his
   people, and has always in readiness the means of effecting their rescue
   from death.

   A Song of Degrees.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 130:1-4

   1. Out of the deep places have I cried to thee, O Jehovah 2. O Lord
   hear my voice; let thine ears be attentive to the voice of my prayers
   3. If thou, O God shouldst mark iniquities, O Lord who shall stand? 4.
   But with thee there is forgiveness that thou mayest be feared.


   1. Out of the deep places have I cried to thee, O Jehovah! It is to be
   noticed that the Prophet speaks of himself as sending forth his voice,
   as it were from out of a deep gulf, [118] feeling himself overwhelmed
   with calamities. As the miseries to which there is no prospect of a
   termination commonly bring despair in their train, nothing is more
   difficult than for persons, when involved in grievous and deep sorrow,
   to stir up their minds to the exercise of prayer. And it is wonderful,
   considering that whilst we enjoy peace and prosperity we are cold in
   prayer, because then our hearts are in a state of infatuated security,
   how in adversities, which ought to quicken us, we are still more
   stupefied. But the Prophet derives confidence in coming to the throne
   of grace from the very troubles, cares, dangers and sorrow into which
   he was plunged. He expresses his perplexity and the earnestness of his
   desire both by the word cry, and by the repetition continued in the
   second verse. So much the more detestable then is the barbarous
   ignorance of the Papist's, in shamefully profaning this Psalm by
   wresting it to a purpose wholly foreign to its genuine application. To
   what intent do they mumble it over for the dead, if it is not that, in
   consequence of Satan having bewitched them, they may by their profanity
   extinguish a doctrine of singular utility? From the time that this
   Psalm was, by a forced interpretation, applied to the souls of the
   dead, it is very generally believed to be of no use whatever to the
   living, and thus the world has lost an inestimable treasure.

   3. If thou, O God! shoudst mark iniquities [119] Here the Prophet
   acknowledges that although grievously afflicted, he had justly deserved
   such punishment, as had been inflicted upon him. As by his own example
   he gives a rule which the whole Church ought to observe, let no man
   presume to intrude himself into the presence of God, but in the way of
   humbly deprecating his wrath; and especially when God exercises
   severity in his dealings towards us, let us know that we are required
   to make the same confession which is here uttered. Whoever either
   flatters himself or buries his sins by inattention to them, deserves to
   pine away in his miseries; at least he is unworthy of obtaining from
   God the smallest alleviation. Whenever God then exhibits the tokens of
   his wrath, let even the man who seems to others to be the holiest of
   all his fellows, descend to make this confession, that should God
   determine to deal with us according to the strict demands of his law,
   and to summon us before his tribunal, not one of the whole human race
   would be able to stand. We grant that it is one man only who here
   prays, but he at once pronounces sentence upon the whole human race.
   "All the children of Adam," he substantially says, "from the first to
   the last, are lost and condemned, should God require them to render up
   an account of their life." It is therefore necessary that even the
   holiest of men should pass under this condemnation, that they may
   betake themselves to the mercy of God as their only refuge. The Prophet
   does not however mean to extenuate his own fault by thus involving
   others with himself, as we see hypocrites do, who when they dare not
   altogether justify themselves, resort to this subterfuge, "Am I the
   first or the only man who has offended?" and thus, mingling themselves
   with a multitude of others, they think themselves half absolved from
   their guilt. But the Prophet, instead of seeking to shelter himself
   under such a subterfuge, rather confesses, after having thoroughly
   examined himself, that if of the whole human race not even one can
   escape eternal perdition, this instead of lessening rather increased
   his obnoxiousness to punishment. Whoever, as if he had said, shall come
   into the presence of God, whatever may be his eminence for sanctity, he
   must succumb and stand confounded, [120] what then will be the case as
   to me, who am not one of the best? The right application of this
   doctrine is, for every man to examine in good earnest his own life by
   the perfection which is enjoined upon us in the law. In this way he
   will be forced to confess that all men without exception have deserved
   everlasting damnation; and each will acknowledge in respect to himself
   that he is a thousand times undone. Farther, this passage teaches us
   that, since no man can stand by his own works, all such as are
   accounted righteous before God, are righteous in consequence of the
   pardon and remission of their sins. In no other manner can any man be
   righteous in the sight of God. Very differently do the Papists think.
   They indeed confess that the deficiencies of our works are supplied by
   the lenity which God exercises towards us; but at the same time they
   dream of a partial righteousness, on the ground of which men may stand
   before God. In entertaining such an idea they go very far astray from
   the sense of the Prophet, as will appear more plainly from the sequel.

   4. But with thee there is forgiveness. This verse leads us farther.
   Though all men confess with the mouth that there is no human being in
   the world whom God may not justly adjudge to everlasting death, should
   it so please him, yet how few are persuaded of the truth which the
   Prophet now adds, that the grace of which they stand in need shall not
   be denied them? They either sleep in their sins through stupidity, or
   fluctuate amidst a variety of doubts, and, at length, are overwhelmed
   with despair. This maxim, "that no man is free from sin," is, as I have
   said, received among all men without dispute, and yet the majority shut
   their eyes to their own faults, and settle securely in hiding  places
   to which, in their ignorance, they have betaken themselves, if they are
   not forcibly roused out of them, and then, when pursued close by the
   judgments of God, they are overwhelmed with alarm, or so greatly
   tormented as to fall into despair. The consequence of this want of hope
   in men, that God will be favorable to them, is an indifference about
   coming into the Divine presence to supplicate for pardon. When a man is
   awakened with a lively sense of the judgment of God, he cannot fail to
   be humbled with shame and fear. Such self-dissatisfaction would not
   however suffice, unless at the same time there were added faith, whose
   office it is to raise up the hearts which were cast down with fear, and
   to encourage them to pray for forgiveness. David then acted as he ought
   to have done when, in order to his attaining genuine repentance, he
   first summons himself before God's judgment seat; but, to preserve his
   confidence from failing under the overpowering influence of fear, he
   presently adds the hope which there was of obtaining pardon. It is,
   indeed, a matter which comes under our daily observation, that those
   who proceed not beyond the step of thinking themselves deserving of
   endless death, rush, like frenzied men, with great impetuosity against
   God. The better, therefore, to confirm himself and others, the Prophet
   declares that God's mercy cannot be separated or torn away from
   himself. "As soon as I think upon thee," he says in amount, "thy
   clemency also presents itself to my mind, so that I have no doubt that
   thou wilt be merciful to me, it being impossible for thee to divest
   thyself of thy own nature: the very fact that thou art God is to me a
   sure guarantee that thou wilt be merciful " At the same time let it be
   understood, that he does not here speak of a confused knowledge of the
   grace of God, but of such a knowledge of it as enables the sinner to
   conclude with certainty, that as soon as he seeks God he shall find him
   ready to be reconciled towards him. It is not therefore surprising that
   among the Papists there is no steady calling upon God, when we consider
   that, in consequence of their mingling their own merits, satisfactions,
   and worthy preparation  as they term it  with the grace of God, they
   continue always in suspense and doubt respecting their reconciliation
   with God. Thus it comes to pass, that by praying they only augment
   their own sorrows and torments, just as if a man should lay wood upon a
   fire already kindled. Whoever would reap profit from the exercise of
   prayer, must necessarily begin with free remission of sins. It is also
   proper to mark the final cause  as we say  for which God is inclined to
   forgive, and never comes forward without showing himself easy to be
   pacified towards those who serve him; which is the absolute necessity
   of this hope of obtaining forgiveness, to the existence of piety, and
   the worship of God in the world. This is another principle of which the
   Papists are ignorant. They, indeed, make long sermons [121] about the
   fear of God, but, by keeping poor souls in perplexity and doubt, they
   build without a foundation. The first step to the right serving of God
   unquestionably is, to submit ourselves to him willingly and with a free
   heart. The doctrine which Paul teaches concerning alms-deeds, 2
   Corinthians 9:7, that "God loveth a cheerful giver," is to be extended
   to all parts of the life. How is it possible for any man to offer
   himself cheerfully to God unless he rely upon his grace, and be
   certainly persuaded that the obedience he yields is pleasing to him?
   When this is not the case all men will rather shun God, and be afraid
   to appear in his presence, and if they do not altogether turn their
   back upon him, they will catch at subterfuges. In short, the sense of
   God's judgment, unless conjoined with the hope of forgiveness, strikes
   men with terror, which must necessarily engender hatred. It is no doubt
   true, that the sinner, who, alarmed at the Divine threatenings, is
   tormented in himself, does not despise God, but yet he shuns him; and
   this shunning of him is downright apostasy and rebellion. Whence it
   follows, that men never serve God aright unless they know that he is a
   gracious and merciful being. The other reason to which I have adverted
   must also be remembered, which is, that unless we are assured that what
   we offer to God is acceptable to him, we will be seized with indolence
   and stupidity which will keep us from doing our duty. Although
   unbelievers often show a great deal of earnestness, just as we see the
   Papists laboriously occupied with their superstitions, yet, from their
   not being persuaded that God is reconciled to them, they do not all the
   while render to him any voluntary obedience. Were they not held back by
   a slavish fear, the horrible rebellion of their heart, which this fear
   keeps hidden and suppressed, would soon manifest itself externally.

   Psalm 130:5-6

   5. I have waited for Jehovah, my soul hath waited; and I have hoped in
   his word. 6. My soul hath waited for the Lord before the watchers of
   the morning, idea, before the watchers of the mourning.


   5. I have waited for Jehovah. After having testified in general that
   God is ready to show mercy to poor sinners who betake themselves to
   him, the Psalmist concludes that he is thereby encouraged to entertain
   good hope. The past tense in the verbs wait and trust is put for the
   present. I have waited for I wait; I have hoped for I hope. The
   repetition occurring in the first part of the verse is emphatic; and
   the word soul gives additional emphasis, implying, as it does, that the
   Prophet trusted in God even with the deepest affections of his heart.
   From this we also gather that he was not only patient and constant in
   the sight of men, but that even in the inward feelings of his heart he
   had maintained quietness and patience before God, which is a very
   evident proof of faith. Many, no doubt, are restrained by vain glory
   from openly murmuring against God or betraying their distrust, but
   there is hardly one in ten who, when removed from the inspection of his
   fellow-men, and in his own heart, waits for God with a quiet mind. The
   Psalmist adds, in the concluding clause, that what supported his
   patience was the confidence which he reposed in the divine promises.
   Were these promises taken away, the grace of God would necessarily
   vanish from our sight, and thus our hearts would fail and be
   overwhelmed with despair. Besides, he teaches us, that our being
   contented with the word of God alone affords a genuine proof of our
   hope. When a man, embracing the word, becomes assured of having his
   welfare attended to by God, this assurance will be the mother of
   waiting or patience. Although the Prophet here speaks to himself for
   the purpose of confirming his faith, yet there is no doubt that he
   suggests to all the children of God like matter of confidence in
   reference to themselves. In the first place he sets before them the
   word, that they may depend entirely upon it; and next he warns them
   that faith is vain and ineffectual unless it frame us to patience.

   6. My soul hath waited for the Lord before the watchers of the morning.
   In this verse he expresses both the ardor and the perseverance of his
   desire. In saying that he anticipated the watchmen, he shows by this
   similitude with what diligence and alacrity he breathed after God. And
   the repetition is a proof of his perseverance; for there is no doubt
   that thereby he intended to express an uninterrnitted continuance of
   the same course, and consequently perseverance. Both these qualities in
   his exercise, are worthy of attention; for it is too manifest how slow
   and cold we are in elevating our minds to God, and also how easily we
   are shaken and even fall at every little blast of wind. Farther, as the
   watches of the night were in ancient times usually divided into four
   parts, this passage may be explained as implying that as the watchmen
   of the night, who keep watch by turns, are careful in looking when the
   morning will dawn, so the Prophet looked to God with the greatest
   attention of mind. But the more natural sense seems to be, that as in
   the morning the warders of the gates are more wakeful than all other
   people, and are the earliest in rising, that they may appear at the
   posts assigned them, so the mind of the Prophet hastened with all speed
   to seek God. The repetition, as I have already observed, shows that he
   stood keeping his gaze perseveringly fixed upon its object. We must
   always beware of allowing our fervor to languish through the weariness
   of delay, should the Lord for any length of time keep us in suspense.
   [122]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [122] Some, as Street, Mant, Dr. Adam Clarke, French and Skinner, and
   Phillips, suppose that the allusion in this verse is to the watchings
   which the Priests and Levites in their turns exercised during the night
   in the Temple, (see Psalm 34:1,) and especially to those officers of
   theirs who were appointed to watch for the first dawn of day, in order
   that the morning sacrifice might be offered. "In the Talmudical Tract
   Tamid it is related, The prefect said to them, Go and see if the time
   of slaying; have arrived; if it had arrived, the watcher calls out,
   vrq'y, Coruscations.' Agreeably to this explanation of the verse is the
   rendering of the Chaldee, which is as follows: "My soul waits for the
   Lord, more than the keepers of the morning vigils, which they observe
   for offering of the morning oblation."  Phillips. "The custom alluded
   to by the Targumist," [or Chaldee,] says Street, "is mentioned in
   Exodus 30:7. And Aaron shall burn thereon sweet incense every morning:
   when he dresseth the lamps he shall burn incense upon it.'" "The
   similitude," observes Mant, "is beautifully expressive of the eager
   impatience of the Psalmist; which is still further augmented by the
   repetition."
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 130:7-8

   7. But let Israel hope in Jehovah; for with Jehovah there is mercy, and
   with him there is plenteous redemption. 8. And he shall redeem Israel
   from all his iniquities. [123]


   7. But let Israel hope in Jehovah. After having spoken of himself, and
   exhibited in his own person an example for all to follow, he now
   applies the doctrine to the whole body of the Church. It is to be
   noticed that the foundation upon which he would have the hope of all
   the godly to rest is the mercy of God, the source from which redemption
   springs. In the first clause he reminds them that although they bring
   with them no worth or merits of their own, it ought to suffice them
   that God is merciful. This mutual relation between the faith of the
   Church and the free goodness of God is to be attentively marked, to the
   end we may know that all those who, depending upon their own merits,
   persuade themselves that God will be their rewarder, have not their
   hope regulated according to the rule of Scripture. From this mercy, as
   from a fountain, the Prophet derives redemption; for there is no other
   cause which moves God to manifest himself as the redeemer of his people
   but his mercy. He describes this redemption as plenteous, that the
   faithful, even when reduced to the last extremity, may sustain
   themselves from the consideration that there are in the hand of God
   many and incredible means by which to save them. This Psalm may have
   been composed at a time when the Church was in so very afflicted a
   condition as might have discouraged one and all, had not the infinite
   greatness of the power of God served as a buckler to defend them. The
   true use of the present doctrine is, first, that the faithful, even
   when plunged in the deepest gulfs, should not doubt of their
   deliverance being in the hand of God, who, whenever necessity shall
   require, will be able to find means, which are now hidden and unknown
   to us; and, secondly, that they should hold it as certain, that as
   often as the Church shall be afflicted he will manifest himself to be
   her deliverer. To this truth the sentence immediately following refers.

   8. And he shall redeem Israel from all his iniquities. Here the
   Psalmist applies more closely to the Church what he has said in the
   preceding verse. He concludes that it is not to be doubted that God,
   who has it in his power to save by multiplied means, will prove himself
   the deliverer of the people whom he has chosen. By these words he
   teaches us, that when we have evidence of our being adopted by God, we
   ought also to regard our salvation as certain. His meaning might be
   explained more familiarly in this way: As to redeem is the continual
   office of God, and as he is not the redeemer of all men
   indiscriminately, but only of his chosen people, there is no reason for
   apprehending that the faithful will not emerge from all calamities; for
   were it otherwise, God would cease to execute the office which he
   claims to himself. He repeats the sentiment of the preceding verse,
   that, provided Israel with all humility draw near to God to plead for
   pardon, his sins will not be an obstacle in the way of God's showing
   himself his redeemer. Although the Hebrew word, vn, avon, is often put
   for the punishment of sin, yet it also contains a tacit reference to
   the fault. Whenever, then, God promises a mitigation of the punishment,
   he at the same time gives assurance that he will pardon the sins; or
   rather in offering to sinners a gratuitious reconciliation, he promises
   them forgiveness. According to this exposition it is here said that he
   will redeem his Church, not from the captivity of Babylon, or from the
   tyranny and oppression of enemies, or from penury, or, in short, from
   any other disasters but from sin; for until God pardon the sins of the
   men whom he afflicts, deliverance is not to be hoped for. Let us then
   learn from this passage in what way we are to expect deliverance from
   all calamities, or the order which it becomes us to observe in seeking
   it. Remission of sins always goes first, without which nothing will
   come to a favorable issue. Those who only desire to shake off the
   punishment are like silly invalids, who are careless about the disease
   itself with which they are afflicted, provided the symptoms which
   occasion them trouble for a time are removed. In order, then, that God
   may deliver us from our miseries, we must chiefly endeavor to be
   brought to a state of favor with him by obtaining the remission of our
   sins. If this is not obtained, it will avail us little to have the
   temporal punishment remitted; for that often happens even to the
   reprobate themselves. This is true and substantial deliverance, when
   God, by blotting out our sins, shows himself merciful towards us.
   Whence, also, we gather, that having once obtained forgiveness, we have
   no reason to be afraid of our being excluded from free access to, and
   from enjoying the ready exercise of, the lovingkindness and mercy of
   God; for to redeem from iniquity is equivalent to moderating
   punishments or chastisements. This serves as an argument to disprove
   the preposterous invention of the Papists respecting satisfactions and
   purgatory, as if God, in forgiving the fault, still reserved for a
   future time the execution of the punishment upon the sinner. If it is
   objected that the Lord sometimes punishes those whom he has already
   pardoned; in reply, I grant that he does not always, at the very moment
   in which he reconciles men to himself, show them the tokens of his
   favor, for he chastises them to render them circumspect for the future,
   but while he does this, he in the meantime fails not to moderate his
   rigour. This, however, forms no part of the satisfactions by which the
   Papists imagine that they present to God the half of the price of their
   redemption. In innumerable passages of Scripture, where God promises to
   his people outward blessings, he always begins with a promise of the
   pardon of sin. It is therefore the grossest ignorance to say, that God
   does not remit the punishment till they have pacified him by their
   works. Moreover, while God's intention in inflicting some punishments
   or chastisements upon the faithful, is to bring them to yield a more
   perfect obedience to his law, the Papists are mistaken in extending
   these punishments beyond death. But it is not wonderful to find them
   heaping together so many heathenish dreams, seeing they adhere not to
   the true and only way of reconciliation, which is, that God is merciful
   only to such as seek the expiation of their sins in the sacrifice of
   Christ. It is to be noticed that it is said from all iniquities, that
   poor sinners, although they feel themselves to be guilty in many ways,
   may not cease to cherish the hope that God will be merciful to them.

   Psalm 131:1

   1. O Jehovah! My heart has not been elated, nor have mine eyes been
   lifted up, neither have I walked in great matters, or in things shut up
   from me.


   1. O Jehovah! My heart has not been elated David had been made head
   over God's people, and in order to prove that he was their lawful
   prince, entitled to the allegiance of the faithful, he is desirous to
   show that he had not been influenced, in anything which he had
   attempted, by ambition or pride, but had submitted himself with a quiet
   and humble spirit to the divine disposal. In this he teaches us a very
   useful lesson, and one by which we should be ruled in life -- to be
   contented with the lot which God has marked out for us, to consider
   what he calls us to, and not to aim at fashioning our own lot, to be
   moderate in our desires, to avoid entering upon rash undertakings, and
   to confine ourselves cheerfully within our own sphere, instead of
   attempting great things. He denies that his heart had been lifted up,
   for this is the true cause of all unwarranted rashness and presumption
   in conduct. Is not pride what leads men, under the instigation of their
   passions, to dare such presumptuous flights, to hurry on recklessly in
   their course, and throw the whole world into confusion? Were this
   loftiness of spirit checked, the consequence would be, that all men
   would study moderation of conduct. His eyes were not lifted up; there
   were no symptoms of pride in his looks or gestures, as elsewhere (Psalm
   18:28) we find proud looks condemned. Something more than this,
   however, may be intended: That while he put a restraint upon the
   risings of ambition in his heart, he was careful that his eyes should
   not lend their assistance to the heart in any covetous aspirations
   after greatness. All the senses, in short, as well as his heart, were
   subjected to the restraints of humility. In denying that he walked in,
   or was conversant with, great things, he must be supposed to refer to
   the disposition or temper of his soul. For, to hold as he did the
   office of a Prophet, to be invested with regal dignity, nay, to sit
   upon the sacred throne of the only-begotten Son of God, not to speak of
   other distinctions with which he was honored above the generality of
   men, were great things. But the expression was applicable, in so far as
   he strictly confined himself to the one object of being serviceable to
   God and to the Church. Should any still be inclined to lay an undue
   stress upon the word which is here employed, I would observe that the
   words from or above me, at the close of the verse, are to be considered
   as connected with what David here says of great things, as well as of
   the things shut up, or hidden, so that we may read I have not walked in
   great things which are above me. The question, therefore, was not
   whether the lot of David was mean or exalted; it is enough that he was
   careful not to pass beyond the proper bounds of his calling. He did not
   think himself at liberty to move one step unless called to it by God.

   His submission in such matters stands contrasted with the presumption
   of those who, without any call from God, hurry themselves into
   unwarrantable undertakings, and involve themselves in duties which
   properly belong to others. For so long as we have a clear call from
   God, things cannot be said to be shut up or hidden from us, or too
   great for us, provided we stand ready for all obedience; and, on the
   other hand, those who yield themselves up to the influence of ambition
   will soon lose themselves in a labyrinth of perplexity. We see how God
   confounds the proud and boasted enterprises of the children of this
   world. They run the full course of their wild career, they turn the
   earth upside down at their pleasure, and put forth their hand in every
   direction; they are filled with complacency at the thought of their own
   talents and industry, and, in a moment, when all their plans have been
   fully formed, they are entirely overthrown, because there is no
   solidity in them. There are two different forms which the presumption
   of those takes who will not submit to be humble followers of God, but
   must needs run before him. Some rush forward with a reckless
   precipitancy, and seem as if they would build to the skies; others do
   not so openly exhibit the inordinateness of their desires, are slower
   in their movements, and cautiously calculate upon the future, and yet
   their presumption appears no less from the very fact, that, with a
   total oversight of God, as if heaven and earth were subject to them,
   they pass their decree as to what shall be done by them some ten or
   twenty years hereafter. These build, as it were, in the deep sea. But
   never shall it come to the surface, however extended may be the term of
   their lives; while those who, like David, submit themselves to God,
   keeping in their own sphere, moderate in their desires, will enjoy a
   life of tranquillity and assurance.

   Psalm 131:2-3

   2. If I have not set and quieted my soul like one that is weaned from
   his mother,  my soul is over me as a weaned child. 3. Israel shall hope
   in Jehovah from henceforth, and for ever.


   2. If I have not set, etc. He here employs a figure which appropriately
   explains what he meant, and likens himself to a weaned child; by which
   is intended, that he dismissed all the anxieties which disquiet the man
   of ambition, and was willing to be satisfied with small things. This
   assertion, which some might be inclined to disbelieve, he makes with an
   oath, expressed in that particular form of which I have elsewhere taken
   notice, in which the imprecation is not directly brought forward, but
   left to be understood, to teach us caution in the use of God's name.
   [124] As to the words, to set his soul like a child, is as if he had
   said, that he would frame it into such a likeness. And this with the
   view, as he declares, of composing himself to silence. For dvmmty
   domaintee, is formed from dvm dum, and has the active sense of reducing
   to silence. The quiet of soul he alludes to is opposed to those
   tumultuous desires by which many cause disquietude to themselves, and
   are the means of throwing the world into agitation. The figure of
   childhood is elsewhere used in another sense, to convey reprehension.
   (Isaiah 28:9.)

   "Whom shall I teach knowledge? them that are weaned from the milk? and
   drawn from the breasts?"

   where the Prophet censures the people for their slowness of
   apprehension, and being as incapable of profiting by instruction as
   infants. In the passage now before us, what is recommended is that
   simplicity of which Christ spake,

   "Unless ye become like this little child, ye shall in no wise enter
   into the kingdom of God." [125] (Matthew 18:3)

   The vain desires with which men are carried away originate in their
   seeking to be wise and careful above what is necessary. David adds
   accordingly, my soul over me is quieted, not as expressing the language
   of self-confidence, but speaking as if his soul lay sweetly and
   peacefully on his bosom, undisturbed by inordinate desires. He
   contrasts the wayward and tumultuous agitation which prevails in those
   of a discontented spirit, with the peace which reigns in the man who
   abides in the calling of the Lord. From the verse with which the Psalm
   closes, we see the reason why David asserted his having undertaken
   nothing in the spirit of a carnal ambition. He calls upon Israel to
   hope in the Lord, words which must have been abrupt had it not deeply
   concerned the common safety of the Church, to know that he sat upon the
   throne of the kingdom by Divine appointment, in which case the faithful
   would be certain of the bestowment of the promised blessing. Our hope
   is of the right kind when we cherish humble and sober views of
   ourselves, and neither wish nor attempt anything without the leading
   and approbation of God.

   [124] "'m-l', A formula of swearing which may be translated surely or
   indeed. I have surely so disposed and disciplined my soul as to remove
   it from any longing after great things, from any ambitious tendencies."
   -- Phillips.

   [125] Of all explanations the best is that of considering the
   comparison to consist between the humbleness and simplicity of the
   Psalmist's mind, and that of a little child, in whom there does not
   exist a sufficient consciousness to create an ambition for any worldly
   object. The comparison is not with yvnq, a suckling; for it has a
   longing after the mother's breast, and, therefore, such a comparison
   would not be appropriate. The same, indeed, may be said of a child who
   has only just been weaned; for, in that stage, how often does it cry
   and mourn after that of which it has been deprived, and the possession
   of which was just before its chief pleasure? We therefore conclude,
   that the comparison is intended to be with a child who has been weaned
   a sufficient time to have forgotten its infantile nutriment, and who is
   not conscious of any particular desires or cravings, and quietly
   resigns itself to its mother's care and training. -- Phillips.

   PSALM 132

   The writer of this Psalm, whoever he may have been [126] here, in the
   name of all the faithful, puts God in remembrance of his promise, that
   he would never suffer his house or kingdom to fail, but support and
   defend both.

   A Song of Degrees.

   Psalm 132:1-5

   1. O Jehovah! Remember David, and all his affliction: 2. Who sware to
   Jehovah, vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob. 3. If; shall enter into the
   tabernacle of my house, if I shall go up upon the cover of my couch,
   [127] 4. If I give sleep to mine eyes, slumber to mine eyelids, 5.
   Until I, find a place for Jehovah, habitations [128] for the Mighty One
   of Jacob  [129]


   1. O Jehovah! remember David. Interpreters are not agreed respecting
   the penman of this Psalm, though there is little doubt that it was
   either David or Solomon. At the solemn dedication of the Temple, when
   Solomon prayed, several verses are mentioned in the sacred history as
   having been quoted by him, from which we may infer that the Psalm was
   sufficiently well known to the people, or that Solomon applied a few
   words of it for an occasion in reference to which he had written the
   whole Psalm. The name of David is prominently mentioned, because it was
   to him that the continuance of the kingdom and Temple was promised, and
   though dead, this could not affect the truthfulness of God's word. The
   Church could very properly pray in the manner which is here done, that
   God would perform what he had promised to his servant David, not as a
   private individual, but in favor of all his people. It was therefore a
   preposterous idea of the Papists to argue from this passage that we may
   be benefitted by the intercession of the dead. Just as if the faithful
   were here to be understood as calling up an advocate from the tomb to
   plead their cause with God, when it is abundantly evident from the
   context that they look entirely to the covenant which God had made with
   David, knowing well that though given to one man, it was with the
   understanding that it should be communicated to all. There is a
   propriety why mention should be made of his affliction or humiliation.
   Some render the word meekness, but there is no reason for this
   whatsoever. In 2 Chronicles 6:42, it is true we read of chsdym; that
   is, mercies, which I consider to be there understood in the passive
   sense, as meaning the benefits which had been conferred upon David; but
   I am clearly of opinion that here the reference is to the anxious
   cares, the numerous difficulties and struggles which David had to
   undergo, so long as he was kept by God in suspense. Remember, as if it
   had been said, the great anxieties, the heavy troubles, which David
   endured before he came to the kingdom, and how fervently and earnestly
   he desired to build the Temple, though he was not allowed to do it
   during his whole life. The dangers, labors, and troubles which he
   underwent, must clearly have confirmed the faith of God's people in the
   truth of the divine oracle, inasmuch as they showed how firmly and
   certainly he was himself convinced of the truth of what God had spoken.
   Some insert the copulative reading, remember David and affliction; but
   of this I do not approve. The particle 't eth, rather denotes that
   special respect in which they would have David remembered, viz., as
   regarded his afflictions, or that he might come forth before the view
   of God with his afflictions, and obtain his desire according to them.

   2. Who sware to Jehovah. One affliction of David is particularly
   mentioned, That he was filled with perplexity on account of the
   situation of the Ark. Moses had commanded the people ages before to
   worship God in the place which he had chosen. (Deuteronomy 12:5.) David
   knew that the full time had now arrived when the particular place
   should be made apparent, and yet was in some hesitation -- a state of
   things which was necessarily attended with much anxiety, especially to
   one who was so ardently attached to the worship of God, and so
   vehemently desirous to have the fixed presence of God with the nation,
   for its defense and government. It is said that he swore to see to the
   building of the Temple, and to postpone every other consideration to
   the accomplishment of this object. [130] The objurgation may seem to
   assume a somewhat too harsh and severe form, when he declares his
   resolution to refuse sleep, his food, and the common supports of life,
   until a place should have been set apart for the Temple. To have acted
   in this way would have been to show an inconsiderate zeal, for it did
   not become him to prescribe the time to God, nor was it possible for
   him to endure any number of fasting days or sleepless nights. Then when
   are we to consider that this vow was taken? I am aware indeed that some
   Hebrew writers judge it to have been at that period when he fell down
   trembling at the sight of the angel; but, without denying that the plot
   of ground was pointed out to him immediately after that circumstance,
   it is altogether a forced and unsupported conjecture to say, that what
   had so long been in the thoughts of David was conceived at that exact
   time. Nor is there anything which should prevent us from supposing that
   his language is here to be understood as hyperbolical, and that this
   was not a vow in the strict form of it, but to be understood in a
   qualified sense  that he would never enter his house, nor ascend his
   couch, without feeling a concern upon this subject. He felt persuaded
   that the settlement of the sanctuary was intimately connected with the
   state of the kingdom; and we need not be surprised that so long as he
   was kept in uncertainty regarding the place of the Temple, he should
   scarcely have felt assured of his very crown, and have been incapable
   of sharing the ordinary comforts of life with any satisfaction. Still,
   where Scripture has been silent we can say nothing certain; and I may
   throw out these things as what seems to me the most probable
   interpretation. And I think the sense of the passage may very well bear
   to be that which I have mentioned, That until informed of the place of
   the Ark's destined residence, David was full of concern and anxiety,
   dwelling in his house, or when he lay upon his bed. As to the vow
   itself, this and other passages afford no ground for supposing, with
   the Papists, that God approves of whatever vows they may utter, without
   regard to the nature of them. To vow unto God that which he has himself
   declared to be agreeable to him, is a commendable practice; but it is
   too much presumption on our part to say that we will rush upon such
   vows as suit our carnal inclination. The great thing is that we
   consider what is agreeable to his will, otherwise we may be found
   depriving him of that wherein indeed his principal right lies, for with
   him "to obey is better than sacrifice." (1 Samuel 15:22.)
     __________________________________________________________________

   [127] The expression of going up to one's bed may be illustrated by
   what Dr. Shaw says of the Moorish houses in Barbary. Having observed
   that their chambers are spacious, of the same length with the square
   court, in the sides of which they are built, he adds, "At one end of
   each chamber there is a little gallery raised three, four, or five feet
   above the floor, with a balustrade in the front of it, with a few steps
   likewise leading up to it. Here they place their beds; a situation
   frequently alluded to in the Holy Scriptures." The language of the text
   is no doubt hyperbolical, as Calvin observes, being intended to express
   David's great anxiety to have a house built for the worship of God.

   [128] msknvt We have here the plural put by enallage for the singular."
    Phillips.

   [129] 'vyr yqvabir Yaaicob, the Mighty One of Jacob. By this
   expression, which occurs both here and in Psalm 132:2, the Psalmist
   evidently has a reference to the Patriarch's own words which he
   employed in his blessing to Joseph, where God is emphatically so
   designated. (Genesis 49:24.) From this Hebrew name 'vyr, abir, and
   kvyr, cabir, which is synonymous, probably came the Cabiri, or the
   great gods of the Grecians, and the Abiry of the Druids. See Thes.
   Antiq. Roman. tom. 5 page 760; Bryant's Myth. volume 2: page 473; and
   Cooke's Patriarchal and Druidical Religion.

   [130] This oath is not mentioned in any of the historical books of the
   Old Testament. There is, however, allusion in them to his vow on the
   subject, although he was forbidden by God to perform it. See 2 Samuel
   7:2, 3; and 1 Chronicles 22:7-10.

   Psalm 132:6-9

   6. Lo! We heard of it at Ephratha; we found it in the fields of the
   wood. 7. We will go into his habitations, we will worship at his
   footstool. 8. Arise, O Jehova! Into thy rest, thou, and the Ark of thy
   strength. 9. Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, and let thy
   meek ones rejoice.


   6. Lo! we heard of it at Ephratha. This verse is obscure, and we need
   not wonder at the difficulty which interpreters have felt in
   ascertaining its meaning. First, the relative pronoun [131] being of
   the feminine gender has no antecedent, and we are forced to suppose
   that it must refer to the word habitation in the foregoing sentence,
   although there it reads habitations, in the plural number. But the
   principal difficulty lies in the word Ephratha, because the Ark of the
   Covenant was never placed there. If the reference be to past time,
   Shiloh should have been the place mentioned; but as it is plain the
   Psalmist speaks of its new residence, the question returns, why
   Ephratha and not Zion is specified? Some would get rid of the
   difficulty by resorting to a frivolous conceit, That the place had two
   names, and that the plat of ground which was shown to David (2 Samuel
   24:18; 1 Chronicles 21:18) was called Ephratha, because it was fertile,
   on which account Jerome styles it karpophorian, and yet is not very
   consistent with himself, for in another place, when he gets into his
   allegories, he most absurdly interprets it to mean frenzy. I have no
   doubt whatever that the word comes from phrhparah, which means to bear
   fruit; just as Bethlehem, which is situated in the same quarter, was
   called for its fruitfulness "the house of bread." But any conjecture
   founded upon the mere name of the place is necessarily unsatisfactory,
   and we must seek some more probable explanation. I might begin by
   mentioning one which is not without force. A rumor had spread that the
   Ark of the Covenant was to be deposited in Ephratha, which was the
   place of David's nativity [132] , and we may suppose at least that his
   native soil would seem to many the most appropriate locality for the
   Ark and Sanctuary. We can easily understand how such an opinion should
   get abroad. In that case the hearing referred to by the Psalmist
   alludes to the report which had been circulated. Should this be taken
   as the meaning, the verb would be in the pluperfect tense, we HAD heard
   that it was in Ephratha, but we found it in the woods, that is, in a
   place by no means so attractive or well cultivated. Jerusalem might be
   said to be woody, because we know that it was surrounded by mountains,
   and that it was by no means in a part of the country which was noted
   for fruitfulness. There is another meaning which I would submit to the
   judgment of the reader. Let us suppose that the faithful here say that
   they had heard of its being in Ephratha, because God had spoken still
   greater things of Ephratha than of Zion. It is true that the memorable
   prediction (Micah 5:2) had not yet been given, yet it may have been
   that God had already issued some very great and signal prophecy
   regarding Bethlehem. We have heard, as if they had said, of Bethlehem,
   but it is only as yet a dim expectation which we have in reference to
   that place, and in the meantime we must worship God in this place of
   the woods, looking forward to the fulfillment of the promise regarding
   Ephratha. This interpretation, however, is far fetched, nor would I
   venture to adopt it, or at least recommend it to others as the right
   one. The simpler way seems to be to understand the word Ephratha as
   applying to David personally, and not so much to the place of that
   name, the declaration of the Psalmist being to this effect  that now
   when God had chosen a king from Ephratha, the place would necessarily
   at the same time be marked out for the Ark of the Covenant. It is said,
   have heard, for the fixing of the place of the Sanctuary depended upon
   the will of God; nor until this was declared could men determine it
   according to their own fancy. The fact that now upon David's mounting
   the throne this illustrious oracle concerning the permanent settlement
   of the Temple was to take effect, afforded good ground of thanksgiving.
   We have proof here that the people of God did not deposit the Ark at
   random in any place, but had express directions from God himself as to
   the place where he would be worshipped  all proper worship proceeding
   from faith, while faith cometh by hearing. (Romans 10:17.) Mount Zion
   had no peculiar excellencies almost to recommend it; but having once
   heard that it was the object of God's choice, they show that they
   consider it wrong to call the matter in question.

   7. We will go into his habitations. Here he dictates to all the Lord's
   people a common form of mutual exhortation to the duty of going up to
   the place which had been pointed out by the Angel. The clearer the
   intimation God may have given of his will, the more alacrity should we
   show in obeying it. Accordingly, the Psalmist intimates that now when
   the people had ascertained beyond all doubt the place of God's choice,
   they should admit of no procrastination, and show all the more alacrity
   as God was calling them more closely, and with a more privileged
   familiarity, to himself, now that he had selected a certain place of
   rest amongst them. He thus passes a virtual condemnation upon the
   lukewarmness of those whose zeal does not increase in proportion to the
   measure of revelation which they enjoy. Habitations are spoken of in
   the plural number, and this it may be (though we may doubt whether the
   Psalmist had such minute distinctions in his eye) because there was in
   the temple an inner sanctuary, a middle apartment, and then the court.
   It is of more importance to attend to the epithet which follows, where
   the Psalmist calls the Ark of the Covenant God's footstool, to intimate
   that the sanctuary could never contain the immensity of God's essence,
   as men were apt absurdly to imagine. The mere outward temple with all
   its majesty being no more than his footstool, his people were called
   upon to look upwards to the heavens and fix their contemplations with
   due reverence upon God himself. We know that they were prohibited from
   forming any low and carnal view of him. Elsewhere, it is true, we find
   it called "God's face," (Psalm 28:8,) to confirm the faith of the
   people in looking to this divine symbol which was set before them. Both
   ideas are brought out very distinctly in the passage before us, that,
   on the one hand, it is mere superstition to suppose God confined to the
   temple, and that, on the other hand, the external symbols are not
   without their use in the Church  that, in short, we should improve
   these as helps to our faith, but not rest in them. While God dwells in
   heaven, and is above all heavens, we must avail ourselves of helps in
   rising to the knowledge of him; and in giving us symbols of his
   presence, he sets, as it were, his feet upon the earth, and suffers us
   to touch them. It is thus that the Holy Spirit condescends for our
   profit, and in accommodation to our infirmity, raising our thoughts to
   heavenly and divine things by these worldly elements. In reference to
   this passage, we are called to notice the amazing ignorance of the
   Second Council of Nice, in which these worthy weak Fathers [133] of
   ours wrested it into a proof of idolatry, as if David or Solomon
   commanded the people to erect statues to God and worship them. Now,
   that the Mosiac ceremonies are abolished we worship at the footstool of
   God, when we yield a reverential submission to his word, and rise from
   the sacraments to a true spiritual service of him. Knowing that God has
   not descended from heaven directly or in his absolute character, but
   that his feet, are withdrawn from us, being placed on a footstool, we
   should be careful to rise to him by the intermediate steps. Christ is
   he not only on whom the feet of God rest, but in whom the whole
   fullness of God's essence and glory resides, and in him, therefore, we
   should seek the Father. With this view he descended, that we might rise
   heavenward.

   8. Arise, O Jehovah? [134] Such language as this, inviting the great
   God who fills heaven and earth to come into a new place of residence,
   might seem strange and harsh, but the external symbols of religion
   which God had appointed are spoken of in these exalted terms to put
   honor upon them, and the better to ensure to them the regard of God's
   people. Should God institute no medium of intercourse, and call us to a
   direct communication with heaven, the great distance at which we stand
   from him would strike us with dismay, and paralyze invocation.
   Although, therefore, he does not thereby change place himself, he is
   felt by us to draw sensibly nearer. It was thus that he descended
   amongst his ancient people by the Ark of the Covenant, which he
   designed to be a visible emblem of his power and grace being present
   amongst them. Accordingly, the second clause of the verse is of an
   exegetical character, informing the Church that God was to be
   understood as having come in the sense of making a conspicuous display
   of his power in connection with the Ark. Hence it is called the Ark of
   his strength, not a mere dead idle shadow to look upon, but what
   certainly declared God's nearness to his Church. By the rest spoken of
   we are to understand Mount Zion, because, as we shall see afterwards,
   God was ever afterwards to be worshiped only in that place.

   9. Let thy priests, etc. He now prays in general for the prosperity of
   the Church, as what stood intimately connected with the previous
   statement, the promotion of our best interests being the great end for
   which God dwells amongst us. Some construe the words into a wish that
   the worship of God might be maintained in its purity, and think that
   the Psalmist prays that the priests might be clothed with holiness in
   allusion to their sacred garments. Upon a closer view of the words and
   the whole context, I am rather inclined to be of another opinion, and
   to consider this a prayer that the righteousness of God might be
   displayed amongst the people, being as an ornament upon the priests,
   and communicating joy to all the people. Thus I take righteousness to
   mean the fruit or effects of righteousness, and this the righteousness
   of God, not of men. The priests are of course mentioned first, as
   holding a higher place in the appointed order of the Church; while they
   have their due place assigned to them, it is still the Church
   collectively to which the prayer refers as though the Psalmist
   requested that the glory of this righteousness should be reflected from
   the priests upon the people generally. God is said to clothe us with
   his righteousness when he appears as our Savior and help, defends us by
   his power, and shows in his government of us that we are the objects of
   his care. The rejoicing which is spoken of must have reference to a
   life of happiness. And these two things being joined together may
   convince us that by righteousness nothing else is meant than God's
   guardianship and government. Consistently with this we find it said
   afterwards  "Thy priests shall be clothed with salvation;" and I may
   add, that Solomon, in the solemn prayer already referred to, (2
   Chronicles 6:41,) makes no mention of righteousness, but of salvation.
   I have repeatedly given the reason why the saints of God are called
   chsydymchasidim, or merciful ones, because mercy or beneficence is that
   grace which assimilates us most to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [131] That is, the objective affix h, which appears at each of the
   verbs in this verse, and which is translated it. By some it is thought
   that the antecedent is 'rvn, aron, ark, which, although it is generally
   masculine, is yet sometimes feminine, as in 1 Samuel 4:17; 2 Chronicles
   8:11. Such is the opinion of Dr. Lightfoot, who explains the verse
   thus: "We heard of it (the ark) in Ephratah, (that is, Shiloh,) a city
   of Ephraim; we found it in the fields of the wood, that is in
   Kirjath-jearim. 1 Samuel 7:1," etc. (Lightfoot's Chorogr. Cent., c.
   45.) Others consider the hto refer to habitations, in the preceding
   verse; and though that noun is in the plural, it is, as noticed in a
   preceding note, put by enallage for the singular. Rosenmuller thinks
   this opinion  which is the one adopted by Calvin  the more probable and
   no doubt at first sight the most obvious meaning is, that the pronoun
   it refers to the spot which David had discovered as a suitable place on
   which to erect the house of God. Walford, indeed, objects that "this
   cannot be intended, because the site of the Temple was neither at
   Ephratah, nor in the fields of the wood, or of Jaar;" and he gives at
   some length an ingenious explanation of this difficult passage,
   extracted chiefly from the German writer Tilingius. This objection, it
   will be perceived, is removed by one of the expositions suggested by
   Calvin, which supposes that the allusion is first to a report of
   Ephratha being the place where the Temple was to be built; and next to
   the certain information which the people of Israel afterwards obtained
   that Jerusalem was the spot which God himself had selected. Whether
   this however is the correct explanation of the verse, it is not so easy
   to determine.

   [132] Bethlehem, the place of David's nativity, is called Ephratha in
   Genesis 35:19.

   [133] "Boni paterculi." -- Lat.

   [134] Arise, O Jehovah! were the words which Moses used (Numbers 10:35)
   whenever in the journey through the wilderness the Ark moved forward;
   and this and the two following verses form a part of the prayer which
   Solomon offered at the dedication of the Temple, (2 Chronicles 6:41,
   42,) which might be considered as the restingplace of God and of the
   Ark. The Ark is here called "the Ark of thy strength"  that is, the
   symbol of thy power and majesty. This phrase is found only in this
   place and in the passage above cited.

   Psalm 132:10-12

   10. For thy servant David's sake turn not away the face of thy Christ.
   11. Jehovah has sworn to David in truth, nor will he turn from it; of
   the fruit of thy belly will I set upon thy throne. 12. If thy children
   will keep my covenant and my, testimonies which I will teach them,
   their children shall also sit upon thy throne for evermore.


   10. For thy servant David's sake, etc. Some would connect the first
   part of the verse with the preceding, without adducing reasons against
   this, it must at once strike the reader that this verse must be taken
   together. Before entering upon an explanation of the Psalmist's meaning
   I may just say that it would be to put a forced sense upon the words
   were we to understand by turning away the face of thy Christ  depriving
   us of a view of the Redeemer. We may infer with certainty from
   Solomon's prayer, that they are a request that God would show favor to
   the king. The same expression is employed by Bathsheba in the request
   which she made to her son Solomon, "Turn not away thy face," meaning
   that he would not cast her out of his sight. (1 Kings 2:20.) It is an
   expression tantamount to shewing displeasure; and we might say a word
   or two in reference to it because the other idea of referring the words
   to our Redeemer is plausible, and might mislead persons of little
   discernment. Nothing more, then, is here asked than that God would not
   despise and reject the prayers which David had preferred in the name of
   all the people. The favor is asked for David's sake, only because God
   had made a covenant with him. So far as that privilege was concerned,
   he did not stand exactly upon the footing of any other ordinary man.
   The prayer, in short, is to the effect that God in remembrance of his
   promise would show favor to the posterity of David, for though this
   prayer for the Church must be considered as dictated to each of the
   kings, the foundation was in the person of David. The Church was thus
   taught figuratively that Christ, as Mediator, would make intercession
   for all his people. As yet he had not appeared in the flesh, nor
   entered by the sacrifice of himself into the Holiest of all, and in the
   meantime the people had a figurative Mediator to embolden them in their
   supplications.

   11. Jehovah sware unto David. [135] Here he brings out the idea still
   more clearly, that the only thing he had respect to in David was the
   free promise which God had made to him. He takes notice of the fact, as
   confirmatory to his faith, that God had ratified the promise by oath.
   As to the particular words used, he speaks of God having sworn in
   truth, that is, not fallaciously, but in good faith, so that no doubt
   could be entertained of his departing from his word. The thing promised
   was a successor to David of his own seed; for though he did not want
   children, he had already almost despaired of the regular succession,
   from the fatal confusions which prevailed in his family, and the
   discord which internally rent his household, and might eventually ruin
   it. Solomon was particularly marked out, but the promise extended to a
   continuous line of successors. This arrangement affected the welfare of
   the whole Church, and not of David only, and the people of Godare
   encouraged by the assurance, that the kingdom which he had established
   amongst them was possessed of a sacred and enduring stability. Both
   king and people needed to be reminded of this divine foundation upon
   which it rested. We see how insolently the sovereigns of this world
   often deport themselves  filled with pride, though in words they may
   acknowledge that they reign by the grace of God. How often, besides, do
   they violently usurp the throne; how rarely do they come to it in a
   regular manner. A distinction is therefore drawn between the kingdoms
   of this world and that which David held by the sacred tenure of God's
   own oracle.

   12. If thy sons keep my covenant. More distinct notice is now taken of
   the descending line, by which the perpetuity of the succession, as I
   have already shown, is pointed out. Sons of princes commonly succeed
   them in this world by right of inheritance, but there was this
   undoubted peculiarity of privilege in the case of David's kingdom, that
   God expressly declared that he would always have a descendant from his
   body upon the throne, not for one age merely, but for ever. For though
   that kingdom was for a time destroyed, it was restored again, and had
   its everlasting establishment in Christ. Here the question occurs  Did
   the continuance of the kingdom rest upon good conduct, or human merit?
   for the terms of this agreement would seem to suggest that God's
   covenant would not be made good, unless men faithfully performed their
   part, and that thus the effect of the grace promised was suspended upon
   obedience. We must remember, in the first place, that the covenant was
   perfectly gratuitous, so far as related to God's promise of sending a
   Savior and Redeemer, because this stood connected with the original
   adoption of those to whom the promise was made, which was itself free.
   Indeed the treachery and rebellion of the nation did not prevent God
   from sending forth his Son, and this was a public proof that he was not
   influenced by the consideration of their good conduct. Hence Paul says,
   (Romans 3:3,)

   "What if some did not believe
   is therefore the truth of God of none effect?"

   intimating that God had not withdrawn his favor from the Jews, having
   chosen them freely of his grace. We know, too, that notwithstanding
   their efforts, as if it had been of set purpose, to destroy the
   promises, God met their malicious opposition with displays of his
   marvellous love, made his truth and faithfulness to emerge in a most
   triumphant manner, and showed that he stood firm to his own purpose,
   independently of any merit of theirs. This may serve to show in what
   sense the covenant was not conditional; but as there were other things
   which were accessories to the covenant, [136] a condition was appended,
   to the effect that God would bless them if they obeyed his
   commandments. The Jews, for declining from this obedience, were removed
   into exile. God seemed at that time "to make void or profane his
   covenant," as we have seen elsewhere. The dispersion was a kind of
   breaking of the covenant, but only in part and to appearance. This will
   be brought out more clearly by reference to what we learn, from sacred
   history, to have occurred shortly after David's death. By the defection
   of the ten tribes the kingdom suffered a severe blow, only a small
   portion of it being left. Afterwards it was reduced by fresh disasters,
   till at length it was torn up by the root. And although their return
   from the captivity gave some hope of restoration, there was no one
   bearing the name of king, and any dignity that attached to Zerubbabel
   was but obscure, till kings sprung up who were spurious, and not of the
   right line. In this case would we not have said that the covenant of
   God was abolished? and yet, as the Redeemer came forth from the very
   source predicted, it is plain that it stood firm and stable. In this
   sense it is said by Ezekiel of the crown, (Ezekiel 21:26,)

   "Remove the diadem; reversed, reversed, reversed shall it be,
   till he come whose it is;"

   where the Prophet might seem to cancel what God had written with his
   own hand, and nullify his promise, for the safety of the people stood
   intimately connected with the throne, according to the expression we
   find in the Lamentations,

   "The breath of our nostrils, the anointed of the Lord,
   was taken in their pits." (Lamentations 4:20)

   The Prophet, we say, might seem to strike directly against the covenant
   made by God, when he speaks of the crown being taken away, and yet what
   he adds in the subsequent part of the sentence, proves that covenant,
   in so far as it was gratuitous, to have been everlasting and
   inviolable, since he holds out the promise of the Redeemer,
   notwithstanding the conduct of the Jews, which was such as to exclude
   them temporarily from the divine, favor. God, on the one hand, took
   vengeance upon the people for their ingratitude, so as to show that the
   terms of the covenant did not run conditionally to no purpose; while on
   the other, at the coming of Christ there was a free performance of what
   had been freely promised, the crown being set upon Christ's head. The
   obedience which God demands is particularly stated to be the obedience
   of his covenant, to teach us that we must not serve him by human
   inventions, but confine ourselves within the prescription of his word.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [135] Compare Psalm 89:48. The sacred histories make no mention of such
   an oath, but a promise to the same effect is recorded in 2 Samuel 7:12;
   2 Kings 8:25.

   [136] "Sed quia secum trahebat alias accessiones."  Lat.

   Psalm 132:13-16

   13. Seeing that Jehovah has chosen Zion, [137] he hath desired it for
   his habitation. 14. This is my rest for ever, here will I dwell:
   because I have desired it. 15. Blessing I will bless her provision, I
   will satisfy her poor with bread; 16. And I will clothe her priests
   with salvation [138] and her merciful ones shall shout aloud for joy.


   13. Seeing that Jehovah has chosen Zion. By coupling the kingdom with
   the priesthood and sanctuary service, he declares it still more
   emphatically to have been of divine and not human appointment. The
   connection is not to be overlooked, on another account. The true
   strength and stability of that kingdom were in Christ, and Christ's
   kingdom is inseparable from his priesthood. This may explain why
   mention is made of Zion being chosen. God decreed nothing in relation
   to the kingdom, but what had a certain connection with the sanctuary,
   the more perfectly to prefigure the Mediator who was to come, and who
   was both priest and king, after the order of Melchizedek. The kingdom
   and tabernacle were, therefore, closely allied. Notice is taken of the
   reason upon which the choice proceeded  that mount Zion was not chosen
   for any excellency belonging to it, as we have seen, (Psalm 68:16,) but
   because such was the will of God. His good pleasure is specified in
   contrast with any merit in the place itself. This is another proof of
   what we have already stated  that the covenant made by God with David
   proceeded from his mere goodness.

   14. This is my rest for ever. The same truth is here put into the mouth
   of God, to give it additional weight; and it is declared not to have
   been in vain that the Temple had been erected, since God would show
   effectually and by practical testimonies the delight which he had in
   the worship of his own appointment. God's resting, or talking up his
   habitation, are expressions which denote his being present with men in
   the manifestation of his power. Thus he dwelt in Zion, in the sense
   that there his people worshipped him according to the prescription of
   his law, and found besides the benefit of the service in his favorable
   answer to their requests. It was eventually seen, in a very striking
   manner, that this was the promise of an infallible God, whet, after the
   Temple had been overthrown, the altar cast down, and the whole frame of
   legal service interrupted, the glory of the Lord afterwards returned to
   it once more, and remained there up to the advent of Christ. We all
   know in what a wicked and shameful manner the Jews abused the divine
   promise which is here made, under the impression that it necessarily
   laid God under an obligation to favor them, taking occasion from if, in
   the pride of their hearts, to despise, and even cruelly persecute the
   Prophets. Luther on this account calls it "the bloody promise;" for,
   like all hypocrites who make God's holy name a covert for iniquity,
   they did not hesitate, when charged with the, worst, crimes, to insist
   that it was beyond the power of the Prophets to take from them
   privileges which God had bestowed. With them to assert that the Temple
   could be stripped of its glory, was equivalent to charging God with
   falsehood, and impeaching his faithfulness. Under the influence of this
   spirit of vain confidence they proceeded such inconceivable lengths in
   shedding innocent blood. Were the Devil of Rome armed with pretensions
   as splendid, what bounds would be set to its audacity? As it is, we see
   how fiercely, and with what bloody pride it arrogates the name of the
   Church, while outraging all religion, in open contempt of God and
   flagrant violation of humanity. But what of that? the hierarchy would
   otherwise fall, and this must stand, if Christ would not desert his
   spouse the Church! The refutation of such a plea is not far to seek.
   The Church is limited to no one place: now that the glory of the Lord
   shines through all the earth, his rest is where Christ and his members
   are. It is necessary that we rightly understand what the Psalmist says
   of the everlasting continuance of the Temple. The advent of Christ was
   "the time of reformation," and the figures of the former Testament,
   instead of being then proved or rendered vain, were substantiated, and
   received their fulfillment in him. If it be still objected that mount
   Zion is here spoken of as the everlasting residence of God, it is
   sufficient to answer that the whole world became an enlarged mount Zion
   upon the advent of Christ.

   15. Blessing I will bless, etc. God's dwelling in the midst of the
   people was what constituted the great source of their blessedness; and
   now some of the proofs are mentioned which he would give of his
   fatherly regard, such as preparing and administering their ordinary
   food, relieving their wants, clothing their priests with salvation, and
   filling all his people with joy and gladness. This it was necessary
   should be added, for unless we have ocular demonstration of the divine
   goodness, we are not spiritual enough to rise upwards to the
   apprehension of it. We have a twofold demonstration of it in the matter
   of our daily food; first in the earth's being enriched so as to furnish
   us with corn, and wine, and oil; and again in the earth's produce being
   multiplied, through a secret power, so as to provide us with sufficient
   nourishment. There is here a promise that God would exert a special
   care over his own people to supply them with food, and that though they
   might not have a great abundance, yet the poor would be satisfied. We
   must not omit mentioning the remarkable and ludicrous mistake which the
   Papists have made upon this passage, and which shows the judicial
   stupidity they lie under to be such, that there is nothing so absurd
   they will not swallow. By confounding two letters into one, for victus
   they read vidus, and then conjectured that this must be a mutilation
   for viduas  blessing I will bless her widows! Thus they made "widows"
   out of "food"  an extraordinary blunder, which we would scarcely
   credit, were it not a fact that they sing the word out in their temples
   to this present day. [139] But God, who blesses the food of his own
   people, has infatuated their minds, and left them to confound
   everything in their absurd reveries and triflings. The inspired penman
   goes on to repeat what he had already said of other blessings, only the
   term salvation is used instead of righteousness, but in the same sense
   I already mentioned. Some understand it to have reference to purity of
   doctrine and holiness of life; but this seems a forced interpretation,
   and he means simply that they would be safe and happy under the divine
   protection.

   [137] Solomon's Temple was built on mount Moriah, and not on mount
   Zion. But as Moriah was just at the end of Zion, it was sometimes
   reckoned a part of that mount, and was called by its name. Even the
   Temple and its courts are so designated, (Psalm 65:1; and Psalm 84:7.)
   Zion may, however, be here put for Jerusalem in general.

   [138] In Psalm 132:9, the prayer of the Psalmist to God is, that the
   priests may be clothed with righteousness; and in this concluding
   portion of the Psalm, where God is declaring what he will do to the
   king and city of his people, he promises to grant even more than was
   asked for in this petition; for, says he, I will clothe her priests
   with salvation;' not with righteousness only, but with what is the
   consequence or reward of righteousness, viz., salvation."  Phillips.

   [139] "tsydh, her provision. The word tsyd signifies food which is
   taken in hunting, and then it is used to express food of any kind --
   provision generally. The Septuagint has theran, which denotes provision
   that has been hunted, and so obtained; but another reading of the Greek
   version ten cheran autos, which has been followed by the Vulgate,
   Arabic, and Ethiopic; the rendering of the Vulgate being viduam ejus
   This corrupt reading is noticed by Jerome."  Phillips.

   Psalm 132:17-18

   17. There will I make the horn of David to bud; I have prepared a lamp
   [140] for my Christ. 18. His enemies will I clothe with shame, and
   upon, him shall his crown flourish. [141]


   17. There will I make, etc. He reverts to the state of the kingdom,
   which God had promised to take under his care and protection. It is
   necessary that we should attend to the peculiar force of the words
   employed  I will make the horn of David to bud Now there can be no
   doubt as to the meaning of the term horn, which in Hebrew is very
   commonly used to signify force or power; but we are to mark that by the
   horn budding there is an allusion to the humble original of the
   kingdom, and the singular restorations which it underwent. David was
   taken from the menial drudgery of the sheepfold, and from the lowly
   cottage where he dwelt, the youngest son of his father, who was no more
   than an ordinary shepherd, and was advanced to the throne, and rose by
   a series of unlooked for successes. Under Jeroboam the kingdom was at
   an early period so effectually cut down again, that it was only by
   budding forth from time to time that it maintained itself in a moderate
   degree of advancement. Afterwards it underwent various shocks, which
   must have issued in its destruction, had it not still budded anew. And
   when the people were dispersed in the captivity, what must have become
   of them, had not God made the broken and trampled horn of David, again
   to bud? Isaiah accordingly seems to have had this in his eye when he
   compared Christ to a rod which should spring not from tree in full
   growth, but from a trunk or stem. (Isaiah 11:1.) To the prophecy now
   before us Zechariah perhaps refers when he says, "Behold the man whose
   name is the Branch," (Zechariah 6:12,) intimating that in this way only
   could the power and dignity of the kingdom be restored after the
   dismemberment and ravages to which it had been exposed. In 2 Samuel
   23:5, David makes use of the word employed in the verse before us, but
   in somewhat a different sense, referring to the continual advancement
   of the kingdom unto further measures of prosperity. Here the inspired
   penman rather refers to the singular manner in which God would cause
   the horn of David to revive again, when at any time it might seem
   broken and withered. The figure of the lamp is much to the same effect,
   and occurs in many other places of Scripture, being a prophecy very
   generally in the mouths of the people. The meaning is, that the
   kingdom, though it underwent occasional obscurations, would never be
   wholly extinguished under the calamities which overtook it, being as
   the lamp of God constantly burning, and pointing out safety to the
   Lord's people, though not shining to a great distance. At that time all
   the illumination enjoyed was but the feeble lamp which shone in
   Jerusalem; now Christ, the sun of righteousness, sheds a full radiance
   all over the world.

   18. His enemies will I clothe with shame. The priests were said above
   "to be clothed with righteousness and salvation," now the enemies of
   David are represented as "clothed with shame." It is not enough that
   all go well within. God must keep us from the various harms and evils
   which come upon us from without, and hence we have this second promise
   added, which is one wherein we recognize often the goodness of God even
   more than in the blessings which he may shower upon us in the day of
   prosperity. The greater that fear which seizes upon us when exposed to
   aggression from enemies, the more are we sensibly awakened to take hold
   of divine help. The passage teaches us that the Church and people of
   God will never enjoy such peace on earth as altogether to escape being
   assaulted by the variety of enemies which Satan stirs up for their
   destruction. It is enough to have it declared, upon divine authority,
   that their attempts shall be unsuccessful, and that they will retire
   eventually with ignominy and disgrace. The, clause which follows has
   been variously interpreted. The verb which we have translated to
   flourish, in the Hiphil conjugation means sometimes to see, so that
   some have explained the words  In that place shall the crown of David
   be seen, when the horn shall have been made to bud. Some derive the
   word from tsyph, tsits, a plate, as if it had been said that the crown
   of the king would be resplendent with plates of gold. But I consider
   that the crown is here said to flourish, just as formerly the allusion
   was to budding or germinating. Isaiah, on the other hand, speaks
   (Isaiah 28:5) of the crown of drunkenness of Ephraim as being a fading
   flower. Thus we have it here declared that however frail to appearance
   the crown of David might be in his posterity, it would be invigorated
   by some secret virtue, and flourish for ever.

   [140] "Some think the lamp (Exodus 27:20) of the Tabernacle to be here
   alluded to. Chrysostom and Cyrill understand that the lamp here
   mentioned has a prophetic reference to John the Baptist." -- Cresswell.

   [141] The idea of the crown flourishing on the head, seems to have been
   suggested by the ancient crowns bestowed upon victors; which consisted
   of certain species of evergreens, as the bay, laurel, ivy, dive,
   myrtle, etc.

   [126] Lightfoot ascribes this Psalm to David, and supposes it to have
   been composed on the second removal of the Ark from the house of
   Obededom. (1 Chronicles 15:4, etc.) But the mention of David's name in
   the tenth verse in the third person, and the terms there employed,
   militate against his being the Author. Others ascribe it to Solomon,
   who, they think, wrote it about the time of the removing of the Ark
   into the Temple, which he had built for it. (2 Chronicles 5:2, etc.)
   Others are of opinion, that it was composed by Solomon for the solemn
   services that were celebrated at the dedication of the Temple. "The
   whole tenor of this Psalm," says Jebb, "is an exact epitome of the
   Dedication Prayer of Solomon. (2 Chronicles 6) The topics are the same
   the building the house of the Lord  the promise to David  the
   inhabitation of the Almighty;  and the concluding sentences of the
   Dedication, are identical with those expressions of the Psalm in verses
   8, 9, 10. There can, therefore, be little question that this Psalm was
   composed by Solomon."  Jebb's Literal Translation of the Book of
   Psalms, etc., volume 2. As this forms one of the "Songs of Degrees,"
   those who conceive that these Psalms were so called because sung by the
   Jews about the time of their return from Babylon, conclude that Ezra
   selected this ancient song to be sung at the dedication of the second
   Temple.

   PSALM 133

   A Psalm of thanksgiving for that holy concord which prevailed in the
   nation, and which the Lord's people are earnestly exhorted to maintain.

   A Song of Degrees of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 133:1-3

   1. Behold! how good, and how becoming, that brethren [142] should even
   dwell together! 2. Like the precious ointment upon the head, that
   descendeth upon the beard, the beard of Aaron, which descendeth upon
   the skirt of his garments. [143] 3. Like the dew of Hermon, [144] which
   descendeth upon the mountains of Zion, [145] for there [146] Jehovah
   commanded the blessing, life for evermore.


   1. Behold how good, etc. I have no doubt that David in this Psalm
   renders thanks to God for the peace and harmony which had succeeded a
   long and melancholy state of confusion and division in the kingdom, and
   that he would exhort all individually to study the maintenance of
   peace. This is the subject enlarged upon, at least so far as the
   shortness of the Psalm admits of it. There was ample ground to praise
   the goodness of God in the highest terms, for uniting in one a people
   which had been so deplorably divided. When he first came to the kingdom
   the larger part of the nation considered him in the light of an enemy
   to the public good, and were alienated from him. Indeed so mortal was
   the feud which existed, that nothing else than the destruction of the
   party in opposition seemed to hold out the prospect of peace. The hand
   of God was wonderfully seen, and most unexpectedly, in the concord
   which ensued among them, when these who had been inflamed with the most
   violent antipathy cordially coalesced. This [147] peculiarity in the
   circumstances which called forth the Psalm has been unfortunately by
   interpreters, who have considered that David merely passes a general
   commendation upon brotherly union, without any such particular
   reference. The exclamation with which the Psalm opens, Behold! is
   particularly expressive, not only as setting the state of things
   visibly before our eyes, but suggesting a tacit contrast between the
   delightfulness of peace and those civil commotions which had wellnigh
   rent the kingdom asunder. He sets forth the goodness of God in exalted
   terms, the Jews having by long experience of intestine feuds, which had
   gone far to ruin the nation, learned the inestimable value of union.
   That this is the sense of the passage appears still further from the
   particle gm, gam, at the end of the verse. It is not to be understood
   with some, who have mistaken the sense of the Psalmist, as being a mere
   copulative, but as adding emphasis to the context. We, as if he had
   said, who were naturally brethren, had become so divided, as to view
   one another with a more bitter hatred than any foreign foe, but now how
   well is it that we should cultivate a spirit of brotherly concord!

   There can at the same time be no doubt; that the Holy Ghost is to be
   viewed as commending in this passage that mutual harmony which should
   subsist amongst all God's children, and exhorting us to make every
   endeavor to maintain it. So long as animosities divide us, and
   heartburnings prevail amongst us, we may be brethren no doubt still by
   common relation to God, but cannot be judged one so long as we present
   the appearance of a broken and dismembered body. As we are one in God
   the Father, and in Christ, the union must be ratified amongst us by
   reciprocal harmony, and fraternal love. Should it so happen in the
   providence of God, that the Papists should return to that holy concord
   which they have apostatized from, it would be in such terms as these
   that we would be called to render thanksgiving unto God, and in the
   meantime we are bound to receive into our brotherly embraces all such
   as cheerfully submit themselves to the Lord. We are to set ourselves
   against those turbulent spirits which the devil will never fail to
   raise up in the Church, and be sedulous to retain intercourse with such
   as show a docile and tractable disposition. But we cannot extend this
   intercourse to those who obstinately persist in error, since the
   condition of receiving them as brethren would be our renouncing him who
   is Father of all, and from whom all spiritual relationship takes its
   rise. The peace which David recommends is such as begins in the true
   head, and this is quite enough to refute the unfounded charge of schism
   and division which has been brought against us by the Papists, while we
   have given abundant evidence of our desire that they would coalesce
   with us in God's truth, which is the only bond of holy union.

   3. Like the precious ointment upon the head. We have here clear proof
   that David, as we have just said, holds all true union among brethren
   to take its rise from God, and to have this for its legitimate object,
   that all may be brought to worship God in purity, and call upon iris
   name with one consent. Would the similitude have been borrowed from
   holy ointment if it had not been to denote, that religion must always
   hold the first place? [148] Any concord, it is thus insinuated, which
   may prevail amongst men, is insipid, if not pervaded by a sweet savor
   of God's worship. We maintain, therefore, that men are to be united
   amongst themselves in mutual affection, with this as the great end.,
   that they may be placed together under the government of God. If there
   be any who disagree with these terms, we would do well rather to oppose
   them strenuously, than purchase peace at the expense of God's honor. We
   must hold, that when mention is made of the Priest, it is to intimate,
   that concord takes its rise in the true and pure worship of God, while
   by the beard and skirts of the garments, we are led to understand that
   the peace which springs from Christ as the head, is diffused through
   the whole length and breadth of the Church. The other figure, of the
   dew distilling upon Mount Zion and Hermon, denotes, that a holy unity
   has not only a sweet savor before God, but is productive of good
   effects, as the dew moistens the earth and supplies it with sap and
   freshness. Moses, we know, said of Judea, that it was not like Egypt
   fertilized by the overflowings of its river, but such as drank daily of
   the rain of heaven. (Deuteronomy 11:11.) David suggests, that the life
   of man would be sapless, unprofitable, and wretched, unless sustained
   by brotherly harmony. It is evident, that mount Hermon must have been
   rich and fruitful, being famed amongst places for pasture. Mountains
   depend principally for fertility upon the dews of heaven, and this was
   shown in the case of mount Zion. David adds in the close, that God
   commands his blessing where peace is cultivated; by which is meant,
   that he testifies how much tie is pleased with concord amongst men, by
   showering down blessings upon them. The same sentiment is expressed by
   Paul in other words, (2 Corinthians 13:11; Philippians 4:9,) "Live in
   peace, and the God of peace shall be with you." Let us then, as much as
   lies in us, study to walk in brotherly love, that we may secure the
   divine blessing. Let us even stretch out our arms to those who differ
   from us, desiring to bid them welcome if they will but return to the
   unity of the faith. Do they refuse? Then let them go. We recognize no
   brotherhood, as I have said already, except amongst the children of
   God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [142] The word brethren is not limited to those who are descended from
   the same parents; it denotes such as are members of the same community,
   profess the same holy religion, and are governed by the same
   institutions. All the people of Israel are in the first instance here
   addressed.

   [143] Kimchi, Jarchi, and others, instead of "to the skirts," translate
   "to the collar of his garment." This seems to give the true meaning of
   the original, which implies that the head and beard of Aaron only were
   anointed, and that the costly sacerdotal robes were thus preserved from
   an unction, which must inevitably have spoiled them. For an account of
   this ointment and of its sprinkling on Aaron, and his sons, see Exodus
   30:23-25, 30; Leviticus 8:12. When Aaron was consecrated High Priest
   the oil was poured on him, whilst on the other priests it was only
   sprinkled.

   [144] There is a mountain called Hermon, which is the highest of the
   ridge of mountains designated Anti-Lebanon, and which is situated in
   the northern border of the country beyond Jordan. This, however, is not
   the mountain supposed to be here intended, but another of the same name
   lying within the land of Canaan on the west of the river Jordan. It is
   described by Buckingham as a range of hills running for several miles
   east and west, and forming the southern boundary of the plain of
   Esdraelon, overlooked in which Mount Tabor is situated. Maundrell, who,
   in his journey from Aleppo to Jerusalem had a full view of Tabor and
   Hermon at about six or seven hours' distance to the eastward, speaking
   of the copious dews which fell in that part of the country, says, "We
   were sufficiently instructed by experience what the Psalmist means by
   the dew of Hermon, our tents being as wet with it as if it had rained
   all night." -- Journey.

   [145] Calvin gives the construction of these words as it is in the
   Hebrew text. But to make them intelligible something must be supplied.
   As Hermon and Zion are many miles distant from each other, it would be
   absurd to speak of the dews of the former as falling on the latter, not
   to mention the difficulty of understanding how the dew of one mountain
   can descend upon another. The translators of our English Bible repeat
   the words like the dew before which descended; and the insertion of
   this supplement is fully justified, as it is the most natural way of
   bringing out an intelligent meaning.

   [146] "The particles, ky sm, refer not to Zion, but are put as
   introducing the reason of the goodness spoken of in Psalm 133:1,
   chyym." -- Phillips. Others, as Lowth, maintain that smmust refer to
   Zion, and that to it the blessing must also refer. "May not smmean the
   place wherever brethren dwell together in unity?" -- Archbishop Seeker.

   PSALM 134

   An exhortation to praise God, addressed to the people of God generally,
   but more particularly to the Priests and Levites.

   A Song of Degrees.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 134:1-3

   1. Behold! bless ye Jehovah, all ye servants of Jehovah, who stand
   nightly in the house of Jehovah. 2. Lift up your hands towards the
   sanctuary, [149] and bless Jehovah. 3. Jehovah bless thee out of Zion,
   who made heaven and earth!


   1. Behold! bless ye Jehovah. Some interpreters think, that others
   besides the Levites are here intended, and it must be granted, at
   least, that some of the more zealous of the people remained over night
   in the Temple, as we read (Luke 2:37) of Anna, a widow, "who served God
   constantly with prayers night and day." [150] But it is evident, from
   the close of the Psalm, that the inspired penman addresses priests
   only, since he prescribes the form of benediction which they were to
   offer up for the people, and this was a duty belonging exclusively to
   the Priests. It would appear then, that the Levites are here called
   servants of God, from the functions they discharged, being specially
   appointed, and that by turns, to watch by night in the Temple, as we
   read in the inspired history. [151] (Leviticus 8:35.) The Psalm begins
   with the demonstrative adverb Behold! setting the matter of their duty
   before their eyes, for they were to be stimulated to devotion by
   looking constantly to the Temple. We are to notice the Psalmist's
   design in urging the duty of praise so earnestly upon them. Many of the
   Levites, through the tendency which there is in all men to abuse
   ceremonies, considered that nothing more was necessary than standing
   idly in the Temple, and thus overlooked the principal part of their
   duty. The Psalmist would show that merely to keep nightly watch over
   the Temple, kindle the lamps, and superintend the sacrifices, was of no
   importance, unless they served God spiritually, and referred all
   outward ceremonies to that which must be considered the main sacrifice
   the celebration of God's praises. You may think it a very laborious
   service, as if he had said, to stand at watch in the Temple, while
   others sleep in their own houses; but the worship which God requires is
   something more excellent than this, and demands of you to sing his
   praises before all the people. In the second verse he reminds them in
   addition, of the form observed in calling upon the name of the Lord.
   For why do men lift their hands when they pray? Is it not that their
   hearts may be raised at the same time to God? [152] It is thus that the
   Psalmist takes occasion to reprehend their carelessness in either
   standing idle in the Temple, or trifling and indulging in vain
   conversation, and thus failing to worship God in a proper manner.

   3. Jehovah bless thee out of Zion! We have conclusive proof in my
   opinion from this verse that the Psalm is to be considered as referring
   to the priests and Levites only, for to them it properly belonged under
   the law to bless the people. (Numbers 6:23.) The Psalmist had first
   told them to bless God; now he tells them to bless the people in his
   name. Not that God meant by any such injunction that the people might
   themselves indulge in a life of carnal security  an opinion prevalent
   among the Papists, who think that if the monks chant in the temples,
   this is all the worship necessary on the part of the whole body of the
   people. What God intended was, that the priests should lead the way in
   divine service, and the people take example by what was done in the
   temple, and practice it individually in their private houses. The duty
   of blessing the people was enjoined upon the priests, as representing
   Christ's person. Express mention is intentionally made of two things,
   which are in themselves distinct, when the God who blessed them out of
   Zion is said to be also the Creator of heaven and earth. Mention is
   made of his title as Creator to set forth his power, and convince
   believers there is nothing that may not be hoped from God. For what is
   the world but a mirror in which we see his boundless power? And those
   must be senseless persons indeed, that are not satisfied with the favor
   of Him who is recognized by them as having all dominion and all riches
   in his hand. Since many, however, are apt, when they hear God spoken of
   as Creator, to conceive of him as standing at a distance from them, and
   doubt their access to him, the Psalmist makes mention also of that
   which was a symbol of God's nearness to his people  and this that they
   might be encouraged to approach him with the freedom and unrestrained
   confidence of persons who are invited to come to the bosom of a Father.
   By looking to the heavens, then, they were to discover the power of God
    by looking to Zion, his dwellingplace, they were to recognize his
   fatherly love.

   [149] "qds. Some persons render this word as if it were an adverb. So
   Tilingins has Attollite manus vestras sanete.' There is no doubt, that
   lifting up the hands reverently, is the ordinary and proper posture of
   suppliants at the throne of grace. Farther, St. Paul, in 1 Timothy 2:8,
   apparently with reference to this passage, speaks of lifting up holy
   hands. The Septuagint and Syriac, however, have taken the word as a
   noun, signifying the sanctuary; the former have hagia."  Phillips.
   Warner and Cress, well with Calvin would read "towards the sanctuary;"
   i.e., towards the holy of holies, where the ark, the symbol of the
   Divine presence, was fixed.

   [150] "We know generally," says Fry, "that there was a nightly service
   in the Temple, (2 Chronicles 21:) and Kimchi, a Jewish writer,
   represents those who by night stand in the house of the Lord, as holy
   men who rose from their beds in the night and went to pray in the
   Temple." After referring to the case of "Anna, a Prophetess," he adds,
   "And St. Paul, before Agrippa, speaking of the hope of the promise made
   unto the fathers,' gives us this remarkable description: unto which
   our' twelve tribes, instantly serving God day and night, hope to come.
   There was public service in the Temple at Jerusalem not only by day but
   by night; which latter service many of the Jews, for whose special use
   this and the next Psalm seem to have been composed, were in the habit
   of attending."  Cresswell.

   [151] Ye servants off the Lord, etc., i.e., ye Levites, whose duty it
   was, according to the Talmudists, to keep watch by night, standing in
   the Temple: the High Priest was the only one who sat in the Temple.
   Compare Leviticus 8:35; 1 Chronicles 9:33 Psalm 92:2; Psalm 119:147;
   Luke 2:37."  Cresswell.

   Psalm 135

   An exhortation to praise God, both for his goodness specially shown to
   his chosen people, and for his power and glory apparent in the world at
   large. A contrast is drawn between idols, which had but a vain show of
   divinity, and the God of Israel, who had established his claim to be
   considered the only true God by clear and indubitable proofs, and this
   with the view of leading his people the more cheerfully to praise him,
   and submit to his government.

   Halleluiah.

   Psalm 135:1-4

   1. Praise ye the name of Jehovah, [153] praise him, O ye servants of
   Jehovah! 2. Ye who stand in the house of Jehovah, and ye who stand in
   the courts of the house of our God. [154] 3. Praise God, for good is
   Jehovah: sing unto his name, for it is pleasant. 4. For God hath chosen
   Jacob [155] unto himself, and Israel for his peculiar treasure.


   1. Praise ye the name of Jehovah Though this Psalm begins almost in the
   same manner with the preceding, the Psalmist would not appear to be
   addressing the Levites exclusively, but the people generally, since the
   reasons given for praising God are equally applicable to all God's
   children. No mention is made of night watching, or of their standing
   constantly in the Temple. But indeed, as it was the special duty of the
   priests to take the lead in this devotional exercise, to give out, if
   we might use such an expression, and sing the praises of God before the
   people, there is no reason why we should not suppose that they are
   primarily addressed, and stirred up to their duty. We need only to
   examine the words more closely in order to be convinced that the people
   are included as next in order to the priests. [156] For the Psalmist
   addresses the servants of God who stand in the temple, then those who
   are in the courts, whereas no notice was taken of the courts in the
   former Psalm. Mention seems to be made of courts in the plural number,
   because the priests had their court; and then there was another common
   to all the people, for by the law spoken of, (Leviticus 16:17,) they
   were prohibited from entering the sanctuary. To prevent any feeling of
   disgust which might arise from the very frequent repetition of this
   exhortation to the praises of God, it is only necessary to remember, as
   was already observed, that there is no sacrifice in which he takes
   greater delight than the expression of our gratitude. Thus, (Psalm
   50:14,)

   "Sacrifice unto the Lord thanksgiving,
   and pay your vows to the Most High;"

   and, (Psalm 116:12, 13,)

   "What shall I render unto the Lord for all his benefits? I will take
   the cup of salvation, and call upon the name of the Lord."

   Particular attention is to be paid to those passages of Scripture which
   speak in such high terms of that worship of God which is spiritual;
   otherwise we may be led, in the exercise of a misguided zeal, to spend
   our labor upon trifles, and in this respect imitate the example of too
   many who have wearied themselves with ridiculous attempts to invent
   additions to the service of God, while they have neglected what is of
   all other things most important. This is the reason why the Holy Spirit
   so repeatedly inculcates the duty of praise. It is that we may not
   undervalue, or grow careless in this devotional exercise. It implies,
   too, an indirect censure of our tardiness in proceeding to the duty,
   for he would not reiterate the admonition were we ready and active in
   the discharge of it. The expression in the end of the verse -- because
   it is sweet, admits of two meanings -- that the name of God is sweet,
   as in the previous clause it was said that God is good -- or, that it
   is a sweet and pleasant thing to sing God's praises. The Hebrew word
   nym naim, properly signifies beautiful or comely, and this general
   signification answers best. [157]

   4. For God hath chosen Jacob Other reasons are given afterwards why
   they should praise God, drawn from his government of the world. But as
   it was only the children of Abraham who were favored with the knowledge
   of God at that time, and were capable of praising him, the Psalmist
   directs them to the fact of their having been chosen by God to be his
   peculiar people, as affording matter for thanksgiving. The mercy was
   surely one of incomparable value, and which might well stir them up to
   fervent gratitude and praise, adopted as they were into favor with God,
   while the whole Gentile world was passed by. The praise of their
   election is given by the Psalmist to God -- a clear proof that they
   owed the distinction not to any excellency of their own, but to the
   free mercy of God the Father which had been extended to them. He has
   laid all without exception under obligation to his service, for

   "he maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good."
   (Matthew 5:45.)

   But he bound the posterity of Abraham to him by a closer tie, such as
   that by which he now adopts men generally into his Church, and unites
   them with the body of his only-begotten Son. [158]

   should be translated, Praise ye the namee Jehovah: that is, praise God

   [154] The words ye who stand we have supplied in the second clause, as
   being necessary to bring out the sense which Calvin attaches to it. The
   vyt yhvh "the house of Jehovah," mentioned in the first clause, remarks
   Men-dlessohn in his Beor, is the place where the priests stood; whilst
   "the courts" surrounding the temple, referred to in the second clause,
   were occupied by the people when engaged in their public prayers.

   [155] The name "Jacob" is here put by metonymy for the posterity of

   Psalm 135:5-7

   5. For I know that Jehovah is great, and our God above all gods. 6.
   Whatsoever doth please him, Jehovah does in heaven and in earth, in the
   sea, and in all deep places. 7. Causing the clouds to ascend from the
   end of the earth, he maketh lightnings for the rain, bringing forth the
   wind out of his secret places. [159]


   5. For I know that Jehovah is great We have here a general description
   of the power of God, to show the Israelites that the God they
   worshipped was the same who made the world, and rules over all
   according to his will, neither is there any other besides him. He would
   not exclude others when he speaks of having known himself the greatness
   of God, but is rather to be considered as taking occasion from his own
   experience to stir up men generally to attend to this subject, and
   awake to the recognition of what lies abundantly open to observation.
   The immensity of God is what none can comprehend; still his glory, so
   far as was seen fit, has been sufficiently manifested to leave all the
   world without excuse for ignorance. How can one who has enjoyed a sight
   of the heavens and of the earth shut his eyes so as to overlook the
   Author of them without sin of the deepest dye? It is with the view,
   then, of stirring us up more effectually, -- that the Psalmist makes
   reference to himself in inviting us to the knowledge of God's glory; or
   rather he reprehends our carelessness in not being alive enough to the
   consideration of it. The second part of the verse makes the truth of
   the observation which I have already stated still more apparent, --
   that the Psalmist's design was to retain the Israelites in the service
   and fear of the one true God, by a declaration to the effect that the
   God who covenanted with their Fathers was the same who created heaven
   and earth, No sooner had he made mention of Jehovah than he adds his
   being the God of Israel. It follows as a necessary consequence, that
   all who depart from this God prefer a god who has no claim to the
   title, and that Jews and Turks, for example, in our own day, are guilty
   of mere trifling when they pretend to worship God the Creator of the
   world. Where persons have diverged from the law and from the gospel,
   any show of piety they may have amounts to a renunciation of the true
   God. The Psalmist had, therefore, in his eye when he clothed God with a
   specific title,, to limit the Israelites to that.God who was set forth
   in the doctrine of the Law. If by 'lhym, Elohim, we understand the
   false gods of the Gentiles -- the title is given them only by
   concession, for it could not be properly assigned to what are mere
   lying' vanities; and the meaning is, that God's greatness altogether
   eclipses any pretended deity. But the expression would seem to include
   the angels, as has been already observed, in whom there is some
   reflection of divinity, as being heavenly principalities and powers,
   but who are exalted by God, and assigned such a subordinate place as
   may not interfere with his glory. [160]

   6. Whatsoever doth please him, etc. This is that immeasurable greatness
   of the divine being, of which he had just spoken. He not only founded
   heaven and earth at first, but governs all things according to his
   power. To own that God made the world, but maintain that he sits idle
   in heaven, and takes no concern in the management of it, is to cast an
   impious aspersion upon his power; and yet the idea, absurd as it is,
   obtains wide currency amongst men. They would not say, perhaps, in so
   many words, that they believed that God slept in heaven, but in
   imagining, as they do, that he resigns the reins to chance or fortune,
   they leave him the mere shadow of a power, such as is not manifested in
   effects; whereas Scripture teaches us that it is a real practical
   power, by which he governs the whole world as he does according to his
   will. The Psalmist expressly asserts every part of the world to be
   under the divine care, and that nothing takes place by Chance, or
   without determination. According to a very common opinion, all the
   power necessary to be assigned to God in the matter, is that of a
   universal providence, which I do not profess to understand. The
   distinction here made between the heavens, earth, and waters, denotes a
   particular governments. The term chphr, chaphets, is emphatical. The
   Holy Spirit declares that he does whatsoever pleases him. That confused
   sort of divine government which many talk of, amounts to no more than a
   certain maintenance of order in the world, without due counsel. No
   account whatever is made of his will in this way, for will implies
   counsel and method. Consequently there is a special providence exerted
   in the government of the various parts of the world, there is no such
   thing as chance, and what appears most fortuitous, is in reality
   ordered by his secret wisdom. We are not called to inquire why he wills
   events which contradict our sense of what his administration should be,
   but if we would not unsettle the very foundations of religion, we must
   hold by this as a firm principle, that nothing happens without, the
   divine will and decree. [161] His will may be mysterious, but it is to
   be regarded with reverence, as the fountain of all justice and
   rectitude, unquestionably entitled as it is to our supreme
   consideration. For farther information upon this subject the reader may
   consult Psalm 115.

   7. Causing the clouds to ascend The Psalmist touches upon one or two
   particulars, in illustration of the point that nothing takes place of
   itself, but by the hand and counsel of God. Our understandings cannot
   comprehend a thousandth part of God's works, and it is only a few
   examples which he brings forward to be considered in proof of the
   doctrine of a divine providence which he had just announced. He speaks
   of the clouds ascending from the ends of the earth; for the vapours
   which rise out of the earth form clouds, when they accumulate more
   densely together. Now who would think that the vapours which we see
   ascending upwards would shortly darken the sky, and impend above our
   heads? It strikingly proves the power of God, that these thin vapours,
   which steam up from the ground:, should form a body over-spreading the
   whole atmosphere. The Psalmist mentions it as another circumstance
   calling for our wonder, that lightnings are mixed with rain, things
   quite opposite in their nature one from another. Did not custom make us
   familiar with the spectacle, we would pronounce this mixture, of fire
   and water to be a phenomenon altogether incredible. [162] The same may
   be said of the phenomena of the winds. Natural causes can be assigned
   for them, and philosophers have pointed them out; but the winds, with
   their various currents, are a wonderful work of God. He does not merely
   assert the power of God, be it observed, in the sense in which
   philosophers themselves grant it, but he maintains that not a drop of
   rain falls from heaven without a divine commission or dispensation to
   that effect. All readily allow that God is the author of rain, thunder,
   and wind, in so far as he originally established this order of things
   in nature; but the Psalmist goes farther than this, holding that when
   it rains, this is not effected by a blind instinct of nature, but is
   the consequence of the decree of God, who is pleased at one time to
   darken the sky with clouds, and at another to brighten it again with
   sunshine.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [159] The heathen who in ancient times worshipped the elements,
   imagined them to possess the power of giving or withholding rain at
   pleasure, Referring to this superstitious imagination the Prophet
   Jeremiah (Jeremiah 14:22) reclaims that power as peculiar to God who
   made and governs the world. "Are there among the vanities of the
   Gentiles that can cause rain? Or can the heavens give showers? Art thou
   not he, O Jehovah, our God? Therefore we will wait upon thee; for thou
   hast made all these things." Among the Greeks and Romans Jupiter was
   armed with the thunder and the lightning; and AEolus ruled over the
   winds. Here the Psalmist teaches us to restore the celestial artillery
   to its rightful owner. The description probably refers to the regular
   rainy season of autumn which comes on towards the end of September; and
   Dr. Russell's account of the weather at Aleppo in that month may be
   quoted as illustrating the particulars of the verse. "Seldom a night
   passes," says he, "without much lightning in the north-west quarter,
   but not attended with thunder; and, when this lightning appears in the
   west or south-west points, which is often followed with thunder, it is
   a sure sign of the approaching rain. A squall of wind, and clouds of
   dust, are the usual forerunners of these rains." Thus God may be said
   to "make lightnings for the rain," inasmuch as the lightnings in the
   west and south-west points are, in the East, the sure prognostics of
   rain; and the squalls of wind which bring on these refreshing showers
   may be said to be brought for that purpose from "God's secret places."
   From Dr. Russell's representing "clouds of draft," as "the usual
   forerunners of these rains," Harmer concludes that ns'ym, nesiim,
   which, in our English Bible is rendered" vapours," must mean, as they
   elsewhere translate the word, "clouds."

   Psalm 135:8-12

   8. He smote the first-born of Egypt, from man to beast. 9. He sent
   tokens and wonders in the midst of thee, O Egypt! On Pharaoh, and on
   all his servants. 10.. He smote great nation, and slew mighty kings.
   11. Sikon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan, and all the
   kingdoms of Canaan. [163] 12. And gave their land for an heritage, an
   heritage to Israel his people.


   8. He smote the first-born of Egypt He now reverts to those more
   special benefits, by which God had laid his Church and chosen people
   under obligation to his service. As it was the Lord's believing people
   only whom he addressed, the chief point singled out as the subject of
   praise is God's having adopted them, small as they were in numbers,
   from the mass of the human family. Again, there was the fact of his
   having set himself in opposition, for their sakes, to great kingdoms
   and mighty nations. The wonderful works done by God in Egypt and in
   Canaan were all just so many proofs of that fatherly love which he
   entertained for them as his chosen people. It is not strictly according
   to historic order to begin with mentioning the destruction of the
   first-born of Egypt; but this is instanced as a memorable illustration
   of the great regard God had for the safety of his people, which was
   such that he would not spare even so mighty and wealthy a nation. The
   scope of the passage is to show that God, in delivering his people, had
   abundantly testified his power and his mercy.

   10. He smote great nations He comes now to speak of the end for which
   God delivered them from their bondage. He did not lead his people out
   of Egypt, and then leave them to wander as they might, but brought them
   forth that he might settle them in the promised inheritance. This the
   Psalmist mentions as another signal proof of the favor of God, and his
   unwearied kindness to them; for having once taken the children of
   Abraham by the hand, he led them on, in the continued exercise of his
   power, till he put them in possession of the promised land. He takes
   occasion to extol God's power, from the circumstance that it was only
   after the slaughter of many enemies that they came to the peaceable
   possession of the country. And it was a striking illustration of the
   divine goodness to manifest this preference for the Israelites, who
   were but a multitude of inconsiderable persons, while those opposed to
   them were mighty kings and powerful nations. Notice is taken of two
   kings, Sihon and Og, not as being more powerful than the rest, but
   because shutting up the entrance to the land in front they were the
   first formidable enemies met with [164] and the people, besides, were
   not as yet habituated to war. As the crowning act of the Lord's
   goodness, the Psalmist adds, that the Israelites obtained firm
   possession of the land. One has said --

   "Non minor est virtus quam quaerere, parta tueri,"

   "It is no less an achievement to keep possession than to acquire it;"
   and as the Israelites were surrounded with deadly enemies, the power of
   God was very eminently displayed in preserving them from being rooted
   out and expelled again, an event which must have repeatedly taken
   place, had they not been firmly settled in the inheritance.

   Psalm 135:13-14

   13. O Jehovah! thy name is for ever; O Jehovah! thy memorial is from
   generation to generation. 14. For Jehovah will judge his people, and he
   will repent himself [165] concerning his servants.


   13. O Jehovah! thy name is for ever There are many reasons why the name
   of God ought always to be kept up in the world, but here the Psalmist
   speaks more especially of that everlasting praise which is due to him
   for preserving his Church and people, the cause being immediately added
   -- that God will judge his people The whole world is a theater for the
   display of the divine goodness, wisdom, justice, and power, but the
   Church is the orchestra, as it were -- the most conspicuous part of it;
   and the nearer the approaches are that God makes to us the more
   intimate and condescending the communication of his benefits, the more
   attentively are we called to consider them. The term judging in the
   Hebrew expresses whatever belongs to just and legitimate government,
   [166] the future tense denoting continued action apparently, as it
   often does, so that what the Psalmist says is tantamount to this --
   that God would always watch over and preserve his people, and that
   being thus under God's guardian care, they would be placed in safety.
   Or we may suppose that the Psalmist employs the future tense to teach
   us that, under affliction, we must have a sustained hope, not giving
   way to despondency, though God may seem to have overlooked and deserted
   us, since whatever temporary delays there may be of his help, he will
   appear as our judge and defender at the proper season, and when he sees
   that we have been sufficiently humbled. This may recommend itself the
   more to be the true meaning, because the Psalmist seems to allude to
   the expression of Moses, (Deuteronomy 32:36,) whose very words indeed,
   he quotes. As some alleviation under the divine chastisements which the
   people would suffer, Moses foretold that God would come forth as their
   judge, to help and deliver them when in extremity. And this the writer
   of the present Psalm, whoever he may have been, makes use of with a
   general application to the Church, declaring that God would never allow
   it to be altogether destroyed, since upon the event of its destruction
   he would cease to be a King. To propose changing the tense of the verb
   into the past, and understand it of God having shown himself to be the
   judge of his people against the Egyptians, puts a feeble sense upon the
   passage, and one which does not suit with the context, either of this
   Psalm or of the address of Moses. The Hebrew verb nchm, nacham, means
   either to repent, or to receive comfort, and both meanings answer
   sufficiently well. On the one hand, when God returns in mercy to his
   people, though this implies no change in him, yet there is a change
   apparent in the event itself. Thus he is said to repent when he begins
   to show mercy to his people, instead of manifesting his displeasure in
   just judgments against them. Again, he is said to receive consolation,
   or to be appeased and reconciled towards his people, when in
   remembrance of his covenant, which endures for ever, he visits them
   with everlasting mercies, though he had corrected them for a moment.
   (Isaiah 54:8.) The meaning, in short, is, that the displeasure of God
   towards his people is but temporary, and that, in taking vengeance upon
   their sins, he remembers mercy in the midst of wrath, as Habakkuk says.
   (Habakkuk 3:2.) Thus God is spoken of as man, manifesting a father's
   affection, and restoring his children, who deserved to have been cast
   off, because he cannot bear' that the fruit of his own body should be
   torn from him. Such is the sense of the passage -- that God has a
   compassion for his people because they are his children, that he would
   not willingly be bereaved of them and left childless, that he is
   placable towards them, as being dear to him, and that having recoginsed
   them as his offspring, he cherishes them with a tender love.

   Psalm 135:15-21

   15. The images of the nations are silver and gold, the work of men's
   hands. 16. They have a mouth, and will not speak: they have eyes, and
   will not see. 17. They have ears, and will not hear; also [167] there
   is no breath in their mouth. 18. Like be they to them who make them,
   whosoever trusteth in them. 19. Bless Jehovah, O house of Israel! bless
   Jehovah, O house of Aaron! 20. Bless Jehovah, O house of Levi! ye that
   fear Jehovah, bless Jehovah. 21. Blessed be Jehovah out of Zion, who
   dwelleth at Jerusalem. Hallelujah. [168]


   15. The images of the nations, etc. As the whole of this part of the
   Psalm has been explained elsewhere, it is needless to insist upon it,
   and repetition might be felt irksome by the reader. I shall only in a
   few words, therefore, show what is the scope of the Psalmist. In
   upbraiding the stupidity of the heathen, who thought that they could
   not have God near them in any other way than by resorting to idol
   worship, he reminds the Israelites of the signal mercy which they had
   enjoyed, and would have them abide the more deliberately by the
   simplicity and purity of God's worship, and avoid profane
   superstitions. He declares, that idolaters only draw down heavier
   judgments upon themselves, the more zealous they are in the service of
   their idols. And there is no doubt, that, in denouncing the awful
   judgments which must fall upon the worshippers of false gods, it is his
   object to deter such as had been brought up under the word of God from
   following their example. In Psalm 115 the exhortation given is to trust
   or hope in the Lord; here, to bless him. The Levites are mentioned in
   addition to the house of Aaron, there being two orders of priesthood.
   Every thing else in the two Psalms is the same, except that, in the
   last verse:, the Psalmist here joins himself, along with the rest of
   the Lord's people, in blessing God. He says, out of Zion, for when God
   promised to hear their prayers from that place, and to communicate from
   it the rich display of his favor, he thereby gave good ground why they
   should praise him from it. [169] The reason is stated, that he dwelt in
   Jerusalem; which is not to be understood in the low and gross sense
   that he was confined to any such narrow residence; but in the sense,
   that he was there as to the visible manifestation of his favor,
   experience showing, that while his majesty is such as to fill heaven
   and earth, his power and grace were vouchsafed in a particular manner
   to his own people.

   PSALM 136

   The Psalmist reminds the Lord's people, that unless they were assiduous
   in his praises, they were chargeable with defrauding him of what was
   justly due to him for his benefits. And, in mentioning each benefit, he
   takes particular notice of the mercy of God, to teach us how necessary
   it is to the proper celebration of his praises that we own everything
   which we receive from him to be bestowed gratuitously. [170]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 136:1-9

   1. Praise Jehovah, for he is good, for his mercy endureth for ever. 2.
   Praise the God of gods, for his mercy endureth for ever. 3.. Praise the
   Lord of Lords, [171] for his mercy endureth for ever. 4. Who alone hath
   done great wonders, for his mercy endureth for ever, 5. Who made the
   heavens by his wisdom, [or, intelligently,] for his mercy endureth for
   ever. 6. Who stretcheth out the earth above the waters, for his mercy
   endureth for ever. 7. Who made the great lights, for his mercy endureth
   for ever. 8. The sun for rule by day, for his mercy endureth for ever.
   9. The moon and stars for rule by night for his mercy endureth for
   ever.


   1. For his mercy, [172] etc. The insertion of this clause again and
   again in so many short and abrupt sentences, may seem a vain
   repetition, but verses repeated by way of chorus are both allowed and
   admired in profane poets, and why should we object to the reiteration
   in this instance, for which the best reasons can be shown, Men may not
   deny the divine goodness to be the source and Fountain of all their
   blessings, but the graciousness of his bounty is far from being fully
   and sincerely recognised, though the greatest stress is laid upon it in
   Scripture. Paul in speaking of it, (Romans 3:23,) calls it emphatically
   by the general term of the glory of God, intimating, that while God
   should be praised for all his works, it is his mercy principally that
   we should glorify. It is evident from what we read in sacred history,
   that it was customary for the Levites according to the regulation laid
   down by David for conducting the praises of God, to sing by response,
   "for his mercy endureth for ever." The practice was followed by Solomon
   in the dedication of the Temple, (2 Chronicles 7:3, 6,) and by
   Jehoshaphat in that solemn triumphal song mentioned in 2 Chronicles
   20:21, of the same book. [Before proceeding to recite God's works, the
   Psalmist declares his supreme Deity, and dominion, not that such
   comparative language implies that there is anything approaching] Deity
   besides him, but there is a disposition in men, whenever they see any
   part of his glory displayed, to conceive of a God separate from him,
   thus impiously dividing the Godhead into parts, and even proceeding so
   far as to frame gods of wood and stone. There is a depraved tendency in
   all to take delight in a multiplicity of gods. For this reason,
   apparently, the. Psalmist uses the plural number, not only in the word
   'lhym, Elohim, but in the word 'dvnym, Adonim, so that it reads
   literally, praise ye the Lords of Lords: he would intimate, that the
   fullest perfection of all dominion is to be found in the one God.

   4. Who alone hath done great wonders Under this term he comprehends all
   God's works from the least to the greatest, that he may awaken our
   admiration of them, for notwithstanding the signal marks of
   inconceivably great wisdom and divine power of God which are inscribed
   upon them we are apt through thoughtlessness to undervalue them. He
   declares that whatever is worthy of admiration is exclusively made and
   done by God, to teach us that we cannot transfer the smallest portion
   of the praise due to him without awful sacrilege, there being no
   vestige of divinity in the whole range of heaven and earth with which
   it is lawful to compare or equal him. He then proceeds to praise the
   wisdom of God, as particularly displayed in the skill with which the
   heavens are framed, giving evidence in a surprising degree of the fine
   discrimination with which they are adorned. [173] Next he comes to
   speak of the earth, that he may lead us to form a proper estimate of
   this great and memorable work of God, stretching forth as it does a
   bare and dry superficies above the waters. As these elements are of a
   spherical form, the waters, if not kept within their limits, would
   naturally cover the earth, were it not that God has seen fit to secure
   a place of habitation for the human family. This philosophers
   themselves are forced to admit as one of their principles and maxims.
   [174] The earth's expanded surface, and the vacant space uncovered with
   water, has been justly considered therefore one of the great wonders of
   God. And it is ascribed to his mercy, because his only reason for
   displacing the waters from their proper seat was that regard which he
   had in his infinite goodness for the interests of man.

   7. Who made the great lights, etc. -- Moses calls the sun and moon the
   two great lights, and there is little doubt that the Psalmist here
   borrows the same phraseology. What is immediately added about the
   stars, is, as it were, accessory to the others. It is true, that the
   other planets are larger than the moon, but it is stated as second in
   order on account of its visible effects. The Holy Spirit had no
   intention to teach astronomy; and, in proposing instruction meant to be
   common to the simplest and most uneducated persons, he made use by
   Moses and the other Prophets of popular language, that none might
   shelter himself under the pretext of obscurity, as we will see men
   sometimes very readily pretended an incapacity to understand, when
   anything deep or recondite is submitted to their notice. Accordingly,
   as Saturn though bigger than the moon is not so to the eye owing to his
   greater distance, the Holy Spirit would rather speak childishly than
   unintelligibly to the humble and unlearned. The same remark may be made
   upon what the Psalmist adds regarding God's having assigned the sun and
   moon their respective parts, making the one to rule the day, and the
   other to rule the night, by which we are not to understand that they
   exercise any government, but that the administrative power of God is
   very manifest in this distribution. The sun in illuminating the earth
   through the day, and the, moon and stars by night, may be said to yield
   a reverential homage to God.

   [171] "The three first verses of this Psalm contain the three several
   names of the Deity, which are commonly rendered Jehovah, God, and Lord,
   respectively; the first having reference to his essence as
   self-existent, and being his proper name; the second designating him
   under the character of a Judge or of an all-powerful being, if Aleim be
   derived from Al; and the third, Adoni, representing him as exercising
   rule." -- Cresswell.

   [172] Jebb observes, that "the 136th Psalm is altogether peculiar in
   its construction, as it has the recurrence of the same words, For
   everlasting is his mercy,' at the end of every distich." He adds, that
   "this elaborate artifice of construction seems characteristic of that
   later period which comprised the captivity and restoration;" although
   he at the same time admits, that it is to be found in Psalms of an
   earlier date than the Baby-lonish captivity, quoting a passage in the
   account of the dedication of Solomon's Temple, which informs us, that
   the whole choir of Israel united in praising God "for he is good; for
   his mercy endureth for ever:" and observing that this expression forms
   the.commencement of three other Psalms, the Psalm 106, Psalm 107, and
   Psalm 118. In his remarks on the Psalm 119, after adverting to the
   alphabetical character of that Psalm, he adds, "There are other
   artifices of construction observable in the Psalms and Hymns composed
   in these later ages of the Church. For example, that repetition of the
   same words and clauses, and the frequent recurrence of a characteristic
   word, so frequent in the Greater Hallel, [from the Psalm 111 to Psalm
   118th, inclusive,] and in the Songs of Degrees: and in a continually
   recurring burden, in each distich, as in the Song of the three
   Children, and Psalm 136, which latter is unique in the Psalter. It has
   been the tendency of the poetry of most countries, in the progress of
   time, to make its characteristic features depend less upon the
   exactness of sentimental arrangement, and more upon some external
   artifice, whether this be prosodial metre, alliteration, rhyme,
   assonance, or the recurrence of a burthen. Now, though the poetry of
   the Scriptures, because it was inspired, never declined from the
   perfection of its sentimental construction, still those artificial
   contrivances, practiced, indeed, in earlier times, seem to have been
   more prevalent at the time of the captivity, and the time immediately
   following, than heretofore. It was probably so ordained, for the
   purpose of assisting the memories of the Jews, who at Babylon were
   excluded from the open exercise of their religion, and from public
   teaching, and, therefore, required more private helps, which could be
   more easily communicated orally from parents to children, or from
   masters to disciples." -- Jebb's Translation of the Psalms, etc.,

   Psalm 136:10-16

   10. Who smote the Egyptians in their first-born, for his mercy endureth
   for ever. 11. And brought out Israel from, the midst of them, for his
   mercy endureth for ever: 12. With a strong hand, and with a stretched
   out arm, for his mercy endureth for ever. 13. Who divided the Red Sea
   into divisions, for his mercy endureth for ever, 14. And made Israel to
   pass through the midst of it, for his mercy endureth for ever. 15. And
   cast Pharaoh and his host headlong into the Red Sea, for his mercy
   endureth for ever. 16. And led his people through the wilderness, for
   his mercy endureth for ever.


   10. Who smote the Egyptians in, their first-born Some read with their
   first-born, but the other rendering reads better. As we do not mean to
   sermonize upon the passage, it is unnecessary to detain the reader here
   with many words, as nothing is mentioned but what has been treated
   elsewhere. Only we may notice that the Egyptians are well said to have
   been smitten in their first-born, because they continued in their
   outrageous obstinacy under the other plagues, though occasionally
   terrified by them, but were broken and subdued by this last plague, and
   submitted. As it was not intended to recount all the wonders
   successively done in Egypt, the whole is summed up in one word when it
   is said, that he led his people forth from the midst of it with a
   mighty and a stretched out arm. For pressed down as they were on every
   side, it was only by a wonderful display of divine power that they
   could effect an escape. The figure of an outstretched arm is
   appropriate, for we stretch out the arm when any great effort is
   required; so that this implies that God put forth an extraordinary and
   not a common or slight display of his power in redeeming his people.
   [175]

   13. Who divided the Red Sea I have already (Psalm 106:7) spoken of the
   word svph, suph, and have not therefore hesitated to render it the Red
   Sea The Psalmist speaks of divisions in the plural number, which has
   led some Jewish authors to conjecture that there must have been more
   passages than one -- an instance of their solemn trifling in firings of
   which they know nothing, and of their method of corrupting the
   Scriptures entirely with their vain fancies. We may well laugh at such
   fooleries, yet we are to hold them at the same time in detestation; for
   there can be no doubt that the Rabbinical writers were led to this by
   the devil, as an artful way of discrediting the Scriptures. Moses
   plainly and explicitly asserts that the heaps of waters stood up on
   both sides, from which we infer that the space between was one and
   undivided. [176] But as the people passed through in troops, and not
   one by one, the pathway being so broad as to admit of their passing
   freely men and women, with their families and cattle, the Psalmist very
   properly mentions divisions, with a reference to the people who passed
   through, this circumstance not a little enhancing the mercy of God,
   that they saw large depths or channels dried up, so that they had no
   difficulty in advancing in troops abreast. Another circumstance which
   confirmed or enhanced the mercy shown, was, that Pharaoh was shortly
   afterwards drowned; for the very different issue proved that it could
   not be owing to any hidden cause of a merely natural kind, that some
   should have perished, while others passed over with entire safety. The
   distinction made afforded a conspicuous display of God's mercy in
   saving his people. Much is included in the single expression that God
   was the leader of his people through the wilderness. It was only by a
   succession of miracles of various kinds that they could have been
   preserved for forty years in a parched wilderness, where they were
   destitute of all the means of subsistence. So that we are to
   comprehend, under what is here stated, the various proofs of divine
   goodness and power which are mentioned by Moses as having been
   vouchsafed, in feeding his people with bread from heaven -- in making
   water to flow from the rock -- in protecting them under the cloud from
   the heat of the sun -- giving them a sign of his presence in the pillar
   of fire -- preserving their raiment entire -- shielding them and their
   little ones in their exile wanderings under tents of leaves, [177] with
   innumerable other instances of mercy which must occur to the reader.

   Psalm 136:17-26

   17. Who smote great kings, for his mercy endureth for ever. 18. And
   slew famous kings, for his mercy endureth for ever. 19. Sihon, king of
   the Amorites, for his mercy endureth for ever. 20. And Og, king of
   Bashan, for his mercy endureth for ever. 21. And gave their land for an
   heritage, for his mercy endureth for ever. 22. An heritage to Israel
   his servant., for his mercy endureth for ever. 23. Who remembered us in
   our humiliation, for his mercy endureth for ever. 24. And hath rescued
   us from our oppressors, for his mercy endureth for ever. 25. Who giveth
   food to all flesh, for his mercy endureth for ever. 26. Make
   acknowledgments to the God of heavens, for his mercy endureth for ever.


   23. Who remembered us in our humiliation The six verses taken from the
   previous Psalm I pass over without observation; and I shall only touch
   very briefly upon the others, which do not need lengthened
   consideration. We may just observe that the Psalmist represents every
   age as affording' displays of the same goodness as had been shown to
   their fathers, since God had never failed to help his people by a
   continued succession of deliverances. It was a more notable proof of
   his mercy to interpose for the nation at a time when it was nearly
   overwhelmed by calamities, than to preserve it in its entire state and
   under a more even course of affairs, there being something in the
   emergency to awaken attention and arrest the view. Besides, in all the
   deliverances which God grants his people, there is an accompanying
   remission of their sins. In the close he speaks of the paternal
   providence of God as extending not only to all mankind, but to every
   living creature, suggesting that we have no reason to feel surprise at
   his sustaining the character of a kind and provident father to his own
   people, when he condescends to care for the cattle, and the asses of
   the field, and the crow, and the sparrow. Men are much better than
   brute beasts, and there is a great difference between some men and
   others, though not in merit, yet as regards the privilege of the divine
   adoption, and the Psalmist is to be considered as reasoning from the
   less to the greater, and enhancing the incomparably superior mercy
   which God shows to his own children.

   PSALM 137

   At the Babylonish captivity the established order of God's worship was
   overthrown, and the Psalmist complains, in the name of the Church at
   large, of the taunts which the enemy east upon the name of God,
   addressing at the same time a word of comfort to his people under their
   captivity, to cheer them with the hope of deliverance.

   Psalm 137:1-4

   1. By the rivers of Babylon there we sat down, we even wept when we
   remembered thee, O Zion! 2. We hanged our harps upon the willows in the
   midst thereof. 3. Then they that carried us away captive required of us
   the words of a song, and mirth when we were in suspense, saying, Sing
   to us one of the songs of Zion. 4. How shall we sing Jehovah's song in
   a foreign land?


   1. By the rivers of Babylon [178] there we sat down I have elsewhere
   said, that it is a great mistake to suppose that it is David who here
   prophetically apprises the people of God of the captivity which should
   come upon them. The Prophets in speaking of future events employ very
   different language. What is brought under notice is the event as now
   historically come, and matter of experience. We shall briefly explain
   the scope of the Psalmist. There was danger that the Jews when cast off
   in such a melancholy manner should lose hold altogether of their faith
   and of their religion. Considering how ready we are, when mixed up with
   the wicked and ungodly, to fall into superstition or evil practices, it
   was to be feared that they might wax profane amongst the population of
   Babylon. The people of the Lord might be thrown into despondency,
   besides, by their captivity, the cruel bondage they were subjected to,
   and the other indignities which they had to endure. The writer of this
   Psalm, whose name is unknown, drew up a form of lamentation, that by
   giving expression to their sufferings in sighs and prayers, they might
   keep alive the hope of that deliverance which they despaired of.
   Another end he has in view, is to warn them against, the decline of
   godliness in an irreligious land, and against; defilement with the
   contaminations of the heathen. Accordingly he denounces merited
   judgment upon the children of Edom, and declares that Babylon, whose
   prosperity, shortlived as it was destined to be in itself, eclipsed at
   that time the rest of the world, was an object of pity, and near to
   destruction. The length of time during which the captivity lasted, may
   of itself convince us how useful and even necessary it must have been
   to support the fainting minds of God's people. They must have been
   ready to acquiesce in the corrupt practices of the heathen, unless
   endued with surprising mental fortitude through a period of seventy
   years.

   When they are said to have sat, this denotes a continued period of
   captivity, that they were not only torn from the sight of their native
   country, but in a manner buried and entombed. [179] The demonstrative
   adverb of place, sm, sham, there, is emphatical, setting the subject,
   as it were, before the eyes of the reader. Though the pleasantness of
   the country, irrigated by streams, might have had an effect in soothing
   their dejected minds, we are told that the Lord's people, so long as
   they dwelt there, were continually in tears. The particle gm, gam,
   even, is used as being intensative, to let us know that the true
   fearers of the Lord could not be tempted by all the luxuries of Babylon
   to forget their native inheritance. The language is such as to intimate
   at the same time that they were not so entirely overwhelmed by their
   calamities as not to recognize in them the deserved chatisement of God,
   and that they were not chargeable with obstinately struggling against
   him; for tears are the expression of humility and penitence, as well as
   of distress. This appears still more plainly from its being Zion they
   remembered, which proves that what had charms for them was not any
   advantage of a worldly kind they might there enjoy:, but the worship of
   God. God had erected his sanctuary like a flag upon mount Zion, that as
   often as they looked to it, they might be assured of his salvation.
   Fair then and fertile as was the region where they dwelt, with charms
   which could corrupt effeminate minds, and long as they were detained in
   it, tears, which are proverbially soon dried up, never ceased to stream
   from their eyes, because they were cut off from the worship of God,
   upon which they were wont to attend, and felt that they were torn from
   the inheritance of promise.

   2. We hanged our harps upon the willows [180] He deplores the
   suspension of the songs of praise, which God had enjoined in his
   Temple. The Levites were set over the department of singing, and led
   the way among the people in this devotional exercise. Is it asked how
   they had carried their harps with them so far from their native land,
   we have in this another proof mentioned by the Psalmist of their faith
   and fervent piety, for the Levites when stripped of all their fortunes
   had preserved their harps at least as a piece of precious furniture, to
   be devoted to a former use when opportunity presented itself. We may
   suppose that those who truly feared God put a high value upon the
   relics of his worship, and showed the greatest care in preserving them,
   till the period of their restoration. [181] When willows are mentioned,
   this denotes the pleasantness of the banks, which were planted with
   willows for coolness. But the Psalmist says that these shades, however
   delightful, could not dispel a grief which was too deeply seated to
   admit of common consolations or refreshment. As they sat upon the banks
   of the rivers covered with the shadows of the trees, this was just the
   place where they might have been tempted to take up their harps, and
   soothe their griefs with song; but the Psalmist suggests that their
   minds were too heavily wounded with a sense of the displeasure of the
   Lord to deceive themselves with such idle sources of comfort. He would
   even go farther, and intimate that joy of a good and holy kind was at
   this time suspended. For though it was neither right nor well judged to
   encourage their grief, we cannot wonder if the singing of praises in
   public was given up till their return from the captivity, called as
   they were by the chastisements of God to mourning and lamentation.

   3. Then they that carried us away captive, etc. We may be certain that
   the Israelites were treated with cruel severity under this barbarous
   tyranny to which they were subjected. And the worst affliction of all
   was, that their conquerors reproachfully insulted them, and even mocked
   them, their design being less to wound the hearts of these miserable
   exiles, than to cast blasphemies upon their God. The Babylonians had no
   desire to hear their sacred songs, and very likely would not have
   suffered them to engage in the public praises of God, but they speak
   ironically, and insinuate it as a reproach upon the Levites that they
   should be silent, when it was their custom formerly to sing sacred
   songs. Is your God dead, as if they had said, to whom your praises were
   formerly addressed? Or if he delights in your songs, why do you not
   sing them? The last clause of the verse has been variously rendered by
   interpreters. Some derive tvllynv, tholalenu, from the verb lly, yalal,
   to howl, reading -- they required mirth in our howlings. Others
   translate it suspensions of mirth. [182] Some take it for a participle
   of the verb hll, halal, to rage, and read, raging against us. But as
   tlynv, talinu, the root of the noun here employed, is taken in the
   preceding verse as meaning to suspend, I considered the reading which I
   have adopted the simplest one.

   4. How shall we sing, etc. The Psalmist puts a lofty and magnanimous
   answer into the mouth of the Lord's people to their insolent reproach,
   which is this, that they abstained from their songs, as from their
   legal sacrifices, because the land where they now were was polluted.
   The Chaldeans thought the Jews were bound down permanently to this
   place of their exile; the Psalmist, when he calls it a foreign land,
   suggests that it was but the place of their temporary stay. But the
   main idea is, that Chaldea was not worthy of the honor of having God's
   praises sung in it. No doubt the children of God wherever they have
   lived have always been strangers and foreigners in the world, but the
   land of Canaan was the sacred rest provided for them, and the Psalmist
   well describes them as being foreigners and sojourners when they were
   in other climes. He would in this way have them to be always ready and
   prepared for their return, tacitly enforcing what Jeremiah had
   prophesied, when, in order to prevent them from forgetting their native
   country, he had definitely foretold the time during which their exile
   should last, (Jeremiah 25:11; Jeremiah 29:10.) He would in the meantime
   animate them to constancy, and have them not to coalesce with the
   Babylonians through motives of fear. In our own day under the Papacy,
   great as the danger may be to which the faithful expose themselves by
   not conforming to the example around them, the Holy Spirit makes use of
   such a barrier as this to separate them from sinful compliances. [183]
   To those, whether Frenchmen, Englishmen, or Italians, who love and
   practice the true religion, even their native country is a foreign
   clime when they live under that tyranny. And yet there is a distinction
   between us and God's ancient people, for at that time the worship of
   God was confined to one place, but now he has his Temple wherever two
   or three are met together in Christ's name, if they separate themselves
   from all idolatrous profession, and maintain purity of divine worship.
   The Psalmist by the language which he employs would by no means put
   down every attempt on their part to celebrate God's praises. He rather
   exhorts them under their affliction to wait with patience till the
   liberty of publicly worshipping God was restored, saying' upon the
   matter -- We have been bereft of our Temple and sacrifices, we wander
   as exiles in a polluted land, and what remains but that in remembrance
   of our outcast state we should sigh and groan for the promised
   deliverance.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [178] By "Babylon" is meant, not the city, but the kingdom; and the
   mention of rivers, according to the suggestion of Rosenmuller, is
   because the synagogues were usually built near rivers, for the greater
   convenience of the Jews, who were obliged to wash their hands before
   prayer. But as they had no synagogues in Babylon, they might frequent
   such localities as would, be suitable sites for places of worship, and
   there in the open air perform divine service. It is conjectured by
   Chrysostom that the Jewish captives were not suffered at first to dwell
   in any of their conquerors' towns or cities, but were dispersed all
   along several rivers of the country, where they built for themselves
   tabernacles or cottages.

   [179] It may also be observed that sitting on the ground is a posture
   which indicates mourning and deep distress. Thus it is said in Isaiah
   3:26, where the captivity of the Jews in Babylon is foretold, "And she
   [Judea] being desolate shall sit upon the ground." And the Prophet
   Jeremiah, in portraying the sorrow which afflicted his pious and
   patriotic countrymen under the desolation of their country, says, "The
   elders of the daughter of Zion
   sit upon the ground and keep silence." (Lamentations 2:10 ) "We find
   Judea," says Mr. Addison, "on several coins of Vespasian and Titus in a
   posture that denotes sorrow and captivity. I need not mention her
   sitting on the ground, because we have already spoken of the aptness of
   such a posture to represent an extreme affliction. I fancy the Romans
   might have an eye on the customs of the Jewish nation, as well as those
   of their own country, in the several marks of sorrow they have set on
   this figure. The Psalmist describes the Jews lamenting their captivity
   in the same pensive posture: By the waters of Babylon we sat down and
   wept, when we remembered thee, O Zion!'" -- Addison on Medals, Dial. 2.

   [180] "On the banks of the Babylonian rivers (say the Euphrates and
   Tigris) there are no woods or forests, or any considerable trees
   besides the cultivated date-palm. But these rivers are in some parts
   rather extensively lined with a growth of tall shrubs and bushes,
   interspersed with some small, and a few middling trees, amongst which
   the willow is at this day the most frequet and remarkable." --
   Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible. Hence Isaiah 15:7 calls the
   Euphrates "the brook or river of willows."

   [181] "It is probable that the Levites, (Ezra 2:40, 41,) who were the
   singers and the musicians of the temple, had taken their harps with
   them to Babylon, and that their captors, having heard of their skill in
   music, demanded of them a specimen of it." -- Cresswell.

   [182] "Others have it from. tlh, he suspended, as thought, they
   demanded joy on our suspended ones, i.e., harps which we had suspended
   from the willows." -- Bythner.

   [183] "Toutesfois le Sainct Esprit leur met ia comme une barre pour les
   separer de toute simulation perverse, comme aussi elle emporteroit
   impiete." -- Fr.

   Psalm 137:5-9

   5. If I shall forget thee, O Jerusalem! let my right had forget. [184]
   6. Let my tongue cleave to the roof of my mouth, if I remember thee
   not, if I set not Jerusalem over the head of all my joy. 7. Remember, O
   Jehovah! the children or Edom, in the day of Jerusalem, saying, Lay it
   bare, lay it bare even to the foundation thereof. 8. O daughter of
   Babylon laid waste. [185] happy he who shall pay thee back the
   retribution wherewith thou retributedst us! 9. Happy he who shall take
   and dash thy little ones upon the stones. [186]


   5. If I shall forget thee, O Jerusalem! This confirms what was said in
   the former verse, and leaves us in no difficulty to understand what the
   Psalmist meant by it. For here God's people declare, and with the
   solemnity of an oath, that the remembrance of the holy city would be
   ever engra-yen upon their hearts, and never, under any circumstances,
   effaced. Having spoken of song, and of the instruments of music, the
   Psalmist's appeal is made in terms which corre-spond -- that his hand
   would forager its cunning, and his tongue cleave to his palate, or the
   roof of his mouth The meaning' is, that the Lord's people, while they
   mourn under personal trials, should be still more deeply affected by
   public calamities which befall the Church, it being' reasonable that
   the zeal of God's house should have the highest place in our hearts,
   and rise above all mere private considerations. The second part of the
   sixth verse some interpret -- If this be not my chief joy to see
   Jerusalem once more in a flourishing condition. Others -- Joy will
   never enter my heart more, till I be gladdened by the Church's
   restoration. Both meanings are in my opinion comprehended in the words
   of the Psalmist. The one cannot be separated from the other; for if we
   set Jerusalem above our chiefest joy, the height of this joy must arise
   from the consideration of its prosperity, and, if this be the case, the
   grief we feel under its calamities will be such as effectually to shut
   out all worldly joys.

   7. Remember, O Jehovah! the children of Edom Vengeance was to be
   executed upon the other neighboring nations which had conspired to
   destroy Jerusalem, so that they are all doubtless included here under
   the children of Edom, who are specified, a parr, for the whole, either
   because they showed more hatred and cruelty than the rest, or that
   theirs were not so easily borne, considering that they were brethren,
   and of one blood, being the posterity of Esau, and that the Israelites
   had, by God's commandment, spared the Edomites, when they devoted all
   beside them to destruction. (Deuteronomy 2:4.) It was, therefore, the
   height of cruelty in them to invite the Babylonians to destroy their
   own brethren, or fan the flames of their hostility. We are to notice,
   however, that the Psalmist does not break forth into these awful
   denunciations unadvisedly, but as God's herald, to confirm former
   prophecies. God both by Ezekiel and Jeremiah had predicted that he
   would punish the Edomites, (Ezekiel 25:13; Jeremiah 49:7; and
   Lamentations 4:21,22) and Obadiah distinctly gives the reason,
   answerable to what is here stated -- that they had conspired with the
   Babylonians. (Obadiah 1:11.) We know that God intended in this way to
   comfort and support the minds of the people under a calamity so very
   distressing, as that Jacob's election might have seemed to be rendered
   frustrate, should his descendants be treated with impunity in such a
   barbarous manner, by the posterity of Esau. The Psalmist prays, under
   the inspiration of the Spirit, that God would practically demonstrate
   the truth of this prediction. Anti when he says, Remember, O Jehovah!
   he would remind God's people of the promise to strengthen their belief
   in his avenging justice, and make them wait for the event with patience
   and submission. To pray for vengeance would have been unwarrantable,
   had not God pro-raised it, and had the party against whom it was sought
   not been reprobate and incurable; for as to others, even our greatest
   enemies, we should wish their amendment and reformation. The day of
   Jerusalem,, is a title given by him, and of frequent occurrence in
   Scripture, to the time of visitation, which had a divinely appointed
   and definite term.

   8. O daughter of Babylon [187] laid waste! The Psalmist discerns the
   coming judgment of God, though not yet apparent, by the eye of faith,
   as the Apostle well calls faith "the beholding of things not seen."
   (Hebrews 11:1.) Incredible as it might appear that any calamity should
   overtake so mighty an empire as Babylon then was, and impregnable as it
   was generally considered to be, he sees in the glass of the Word its
   destruction and overthrow. He calls upon all God's people to do the
   same, and by faith from the elevation of heaven's oracles, to despise
   the pride of that abandoned city. If the divine promises inspire us
   with hope and confidence, and God's Spirit attemper our afflictions to
   the rule of his own uprightness, we shall lift up our heads in the
   lowest depths of affliction to which we may be east down, and glory in
   the fact that it is well with us in our worst distresses, and that our
   enemies are devoted to destruction. In declaring those to be happy who
   should pay back vengeance upon the Babylonians, he does not mean that
   the service done by the Medes and Persians, in itself met with the
   approbation of God; [188] for they were actuated in the war by
   ambition, insatiable covetousness, and unprincipled rivalry; but he
   declares that a war which was carried on in a manner under God's
   auspices, should be crowned with success. As God had determined to
   punish Babylon, he pronounced a blessing upon Cyrus and Darius, while
   on the other hand Jeremiah (Jeremiah 48:10) declares those cursed who
   should do the work of the Lord negligently, that is, fail in
   strenuously carrying out the work of desolation and destruction, to
   which God had called them as his hired executioners. It may seem to
   savor of cruelty, that he should wish the tender and innocent infants
   to be dashed and mangled upon the stones, but he does not speak under
   the impulse of personal feeling, and only employs words which God had
   himself authorized, so that this is but the declaration of a just
   judgment, as when our Lord says,

   "With what measure ye mete, it shall be measured to you again."
   (Matthew 7:2.)

   Isaiah (Isaiah 13:16) had issued a special prediction in reference to
   Babylon, which the Psalmist has doubtless here in his eye -- "Behold
   God has sharpened the iron, and bent the bows; he sends forth the Medes
   and Persians, which shall not regard silver and gold; they shall thirst
   for blood only," etc.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [184] Let my right hand forget The sentence ends abruptly, and some
   supplementary word is necessary to render it complete. The Chaldee
   version, by altering the person of the verb, has avoided the ellipsis,
   May I forget, my right hand. The Syriac reads, May my right hand
   forget.me. The Septuagint has a passive verb, viz., epilesthein, as if
   the original were tskch. Calvin, in his Commentary, makes the same
   supplement as the translators of our English Bible -- Let my right hand
   forget its cunning; and the correctness of this view is supported by
   the following verse, where we have, Let my tongue cleave to the roof of
   my mouth, etc. The object of both verses is to express a deep,
   heart-felt interest in Jerusalem; and should he lose that interest, the
   Psalmist wishes that the two members of the body, by which both
   instrumental and vocal music are performed, may be rendered incapable
   of doing their work -- that the tongue may be unable to utter, and the
   right hand may forget the art of playing, or its cunning. "There here
   is a striking and appropriate point in this which has been overlooked.
   It is, that as it is customary for people in the East to swear by their
   possessions, so one who has no possessions -- who is poor and
   destitute, and has nothing of recognised value in the world -- swears
   by his right hand, which is his whole stake in society, trod by the
   cunning' of which he earns his daily bread. Hence the common Arabic
   proverb, (given by Burckhardt, No. 550,) reflecting on the change of
   demeanour produced by improved circumstances: He was wont to swear by
   the cutting off of his right hand! He now swears by the giving of money
   to the poor.'" -- Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible.

   [185] Bishop Horsley translates, "O daughter of Babylon, that
   delightest in destruction."

   [186] "This is not the language of imprecation, but of prophecy, and
   predicts the horrors which would accompany the taking and sacking of
   the city of Babylon; and amongst these the atrocious cruelty of dashing
   the children against the stones.' (See Isaiah 13:16; Jeremiah 51:62;
   Hosea 13:16.) Homer mentions the unnatural practice as not uncommon in
   ancient times -- Infants dashed
   Against the ground, in dire hostility.'
   -- I1, 22 5 63." -- Warner. "Happy he," etc., is merely declarative of
   the general opinion which would be reputed happy, would be celebrated
   as having done good service in the world, by destroying a power so
   universally hated for its oppression.

   [187] Daughter of Babylon denotes the inhabitants of the Babylonish
   empire. The inhabitants of a city or kingdom are frequently spoken of
   in Scripture as its daughter. (See Psalm 45:13; Isaiah 47:1; Zechariah
   9:9.)

   [188] "Il n'entend pas que le service des Perses et Medes ait este
   agreable a Dieu," etc. -- Fr.

   PSALM 138

   In this Psalm David, in remembrance of the singular help which had
   always been vouchsafed him by God -- the experience he had enjoyed of
   his faithfulness and goodness, takes occasion to stir himself up to
   gratitude; and from what he had known of the divine faithfulness, he
   anticipates a continuance of the same mercy. If dangers must be met, he
   confidently looks for a happy issue.

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 138:1-5

   1. I will praise thee [189] with my whole heart, before the gods [190]
   will I sing psalms to thee. 2. I will worship thee towards the temple
   of thy holiness, and sing unto thy name for thy mercy and for thy
   truth; for thou hast magnified thy name above all things by thy word.
   3. In the day when I cried to thee then thou answeredst me, and hast
   abundantly ministered strength to me in my soul. 4. Let all kings of
   the earth praise thee, O Jehovah! because they have heard the words of
   thy mouth. 5. And let theta sing in [191] the walls of Jehovah, for
   great is the glory of Jehovah.


   1. I will praise thee with my whole heart As David had been honored to
   receive distinguishing marks of the divine favor, he declares his
   resolution to show more than ordinary gratitude. This is exercise which
   degenerates and is degraded in the case of hypocrites to a mere sound
   of empty words, but he states that he would return thanks to God not
   with the lips only, but with sincerity of heart, for by the whole
   heart, as we have elsewhere seen, is meant a heart which is sincere and
   not double. The noun 'lhym, Elohim, sometimes means angels, and
   sometimes kings, and either meaning will suit with the passage before
   us. The praise David speaks of is that which is of a public kind. The
   solemn assembly is, so to speak, a heavenly theater, graced by the
   presence of attending angels; and one reason why the cherubim
   overshadowed the Ark of the Covenant was to let God's people know that
   the angels are present when they come to worship in the sanctuary. We
   might very properly apply what is said here to kings, on account of
   their eminence in rank, as in Psalm 107:32, "Praise ye the Lord in the
   assembly of the elders" -- that is, as we should say, in an assembly of
   an honored and illustrious kind. But I prefer the former sense, and
   this because believers in drawing near to God are withdrawn from the
   world, and rise to heaven in the enjoyment of fellowship with angels,
   so that we find Paul enforcing his address to the Corinthians upon the
   necessity of decency and order, by requiring them to show some respect
   at least in their public religious assemblies to the angels. (1
   Corinthians 11:10.) The same thing was represented by God long before,
   under the figure of the cherubim, thus giving his people a visible
   pledge of his presence.

   2. I will worship towards the temple [192] of thy holiness. He
   intimates that he would show more than private gratitude, and, in order
   to set an example before others, come in compliance with the precept of
   the law into the sanctuary. He worshipped God spiritually, and yet
   would lift his eyes to those outward symbols which were the means then
   appointed for drawing the minds of God's people upwards. He singles out
   the divine mercy and truth as the subject of his praise, for while the
   power and greatness of God are equally worthy of commendation, nothing
   has a more sensible influence in stimulating us to thanksgiving than
   his free mercy; and in communicating to us of his goodness he opens our
   mouth to sing his praises. As we cannot taste, or at least have any
   lively apprehensions in our souls of the divine mercy otherwise than
   through the word, mention is made of his faithfulness or truth. This
   coupling of mercy with truth is to be particularly taken notice of, as
   I have frequently observed, for however much the goodness of God may
   appear to us in its effects, such is our insensibility that it will
   never penetrate our minds, unless the word have come to us in the first
   place. Goodness is first mentioned, because the only ground upon which
   God shows himself to us as true is his having bound himself by his free
   promise. And it is in this that his unspeakable mercy shows itself --
   that he prevents those with it who were at a distance from him, and
   invites them to draw near to him by condescending to address them in a
   familiar manner. In the end of the verse some supply the copulative,
   and read -- Thou hast magnified thy name and thy word above all things
   [193] This learned interpreters have rejected as a meagre rendering,
   and yet have themselves had recourse to what I consider a forced
   interpretation, Thou hast magnified thy name above all thy word I am
   satisfied David means to declare that God's name is exalted above all
   things, specifying the particular manner in which he has exalted his
   name, by faithfully performing his free promises. Nor can any doubt
   that owing to our blind insensibility to the benefits which God bestows
   upon us, the best way in which he can awaken us to the right notice of
   them is by first addressing his word to us and then certifying and
   sealing his goodness by accomplishing what he has promised.

   3. In the day when I cried to thee, etc. Frequently God prevents our
   prayers, and surprises us, as it were, sleeping: but commonly he stirs
   us up to prayer by the influence of his Spirit, and this to illustrate
   his goodness the more by our finding that he crowns our prayers with
   success. David well infers that his escape front danger could not have
   been merely fortuitous, as it plainly appeared that God had answered
   him. This then is one thing noticeable, that our prayers more nearly
   discover his goodness to us. Some supply a copulative in the second
   part of the verse -- Thou hast increased me, and in my soul is
   strength. But this is not called for, since the words read well enough
   as they stand, whether we render the passage as I have done above, or
   translate it, Thou hast multiplied, or increased, me with strength in
   my soul. The sense, is, That from a weak and afflicted state he had
   received fresh strength to his spirit Or some may, perhaps, prefer
   resolving it thus: Thou hast multiplied -- that is, blest me, whence
   strength in my soul.

   4. Let all kings of the earth praise thee Here he declares that the
   goodness he had experienced would be extensively known, and the report
   of it spread over all the world. In saying that even kings had heard
   the words of God's mouth, he does not mean to aver that they had been
   taught in the true religion so as to be prepared for becoming members
   of the Church, but only that it would be well known everywhere that the
   reason of his having been preserved in such a wonderful manner was
   God's having anointed him king by his commandment. [194] Thus although
   the neighboring kings reaped no advantage by that divine oracle, the
   goodness of God was illustrated by its being universally known, by his
   being called to the throne in an extraordinary manner. Having uniformly
   during the whole period of Saul's severe and bloody persecution
   declared that he raised his standard in God's name, there could be no
   doubt that he came to the crown by divine will and commandment. And
   this was a proof of divine goodness which might draw forth an
   acknowledgment even from heathen kings.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [189] Here "O Jehovah" is to be understood. Though it is not in the
   received Hebrew text, it was found in six copies examined by Dr.
   Kennicott, and in eight examined by De Rossi. The Septuagint, Arabic,
   Vulgate, and AEthiopic versions add" Jehovah" after the verb for
   "praise." "The omission of the Divine name," says Jebb, in his
   Translation of the Psalms, "in a passage like this, at the beginning of
   the Psalm, is altogether unexampled."

   [190] By the Hebrew word 'lhym, Elohim, translated gods, Calvin
   understands "angels" or "kings," but particularly the former. It is
   however proper to observe that 'lhym, Elohim, is one of the names
   applied to the Supreme Being in the sacred volume, and therefore some
   critics translate "before God," which they explain as meaning "before
   the ark," where were the sacred symbols of his presence. If after the
   Hebrew word for "before," we should suppose "thee" to be understood,
   the reading would be "before thee, or in thy presence, O God! will I
   sing praise unto thee."

   [191] Phillips observes that the force of v, beth, seems to be that of
   concerning: -- "The kings of the earth shall sing concerning the ways
   of the Lord,' how that they are good and merciful."

   [192] This Psalm is entitled "a Psalm of David," and Calvin considers
   him to be its author agreeably to the title; lint the mention of "the
   temple" in the second verse seems to render such an opinion doubtful.
   If, however, we translate this word by "mansion," which is the proper
   rendering of the original -- "the mansion of thy sanctity:" this
   objection to its composition by David falls to the ground. In the
   Septuagint version the title of this Psalm is, "A Psalm of David; of
   Haggai and Zechariah, when they were dispersed," (comp. Ezra 5:1);
   meaning a Psalm of David, used by Haggai and Zechariah.

   [193] According to this mode of rendering the passage kl, cal, the word
   for all, is independent of smk, shimcha, the word for thy name. But "it
   has been properly observed by Aben Ezra, that kl in this case should
   have a Cholem, and not a Kametz Chateph, with which it is found in all
   copies. Besides, this translation is not supported by any of the
   ancient versions." -- Phillips.

   servatum fuisse a Deo, nisi quod ejus mandate unctus fuerat in Regem."

   Psalm 138:6-8

   6. Because Jehovah the exalted will yet have respect to the lowly, and
   being high will know afar off, [or, will know afar off him that is
   high.] 7. Should I will [195] in the midst of trouble thou wilt revive
   me: thou wilt put forth thy hand against the wrath of mine enemies, and
   thy right hand shall save me. 8. Jehovah will recompense upon me. [196]
   thy mercy, O Jehovah! is for ever; thou wilt not forsake the works of
   thine own hand.


   6. Because Jehovah the exalted, etc. In this verse he passes
   commendation upon God's general government of the world. The thing of
   all others most necessary to be known is, that he is not indifferent to
   our safety; for though in words we are all ready to grant this, our
   disbelief of it is shown by the feat' we betray upon the slightest
   appearance of danger, and we would not give way to such alarm if we had
   a solid persuasion of our being under his fatherly protection. Some
   read, Jehovah on high, that is, he sits on his heavenly throne
   governing the world; but I prefer considering, that there is an
   opposition intended -- that the greatness of God does not prevent his
   having' respect to the poor and humble ones of the earth. This is
   confirmed by what is stated in the second clause, That being highly
   exalted he recognises afar off, or from a distance. Some read gvh,
   gabah, in the accusative case, and this gives a meaning to the words
   which answers well to the context, That God does not honor the high and
   haughty by looking near to them -- that he despises them -- while, with
   regard to the poor and humble, who might seem to be at a great distance
   from him, he takes care of them, as if they were near to him. By some
   the verb yd, yada, is rendered, to crush, and they take the meaning to
   be, that God, while he favors the lowly, treads down the mighty who
   glory in their prosperity. There is reason to doubt, however, whether
   any such refinement of meaning is to be attached to David's words, and
   it is enough to conclude, that he here repeats the same sentiment
   formerly expressed, that God though highly exalted, takes notice of
   what might be thought to escape his observation. Thus we have seen,
   (Psalm 113:6,)

   "The Lord dwelleth on high, yet he humbleth himself to behold both the
   things that are in heaven and on earth."

   The meaning is, that though God's glory is far above all heavens, the
   distance at which he is placed does not prevent his governing the world
   by his providence. God is highly exalted, but he sees after off, so
   that he needs not change place when he would condescend to take care of
   us. We on our part are poor and lowly, but our wretched condition is;
   no reason why God will not concern himself about us. While we view with
   admiration the immensity of his glory as raised above all heavens, we
   must not disbelieve his willingness to foster us under his fatherly
   care. The two things are, with great propriety, conjoined here by
   David, that, on the one hand, when we think of God's majesty we should
   not be terrified into a forgetfulness of his goodness and benignity,
   nor, on the other, lose our reverence for his majesty in contemplating
   the condescension of his mercy. [197]

   7. Should I walk in the midst of trouble, etc. Here David declares the
   sense in which he looked flint God would act the part of his preserver
   -- by giving him life from the dead, were that necessary. The passage
   is well deserving our attention for by nature we are so delicately
   averse to suffering as to wish that we might all live safely beyond
   shot of its arrows, and shrink from close contact with the fear of
   death, as something altogether intolerable. On the slightest approach
   of danger we are immoderately afraid, as if our emergencies precluded
   the hope of Divine deliverance. This is faith's true office, to see
   life in the midst of death, and to trust the mercy of God -- not as
   that which will procure us universal exemption from evil, but as that
   which will quicken us in the midst of death every moment of our lives;
   for God humbles his children under various trials, that his defense of
   them may be the more remarkable, and that he may show himself to be
   their deliverer, as well as their preserver. In the world believers are
   constantly exposed to enemies, and David asserts, that he will be safe
   under God's protection from all their machinations. He declares his
   hope of life to lie in this, that the hand of God was stretched out for
   his help, that hand which he knew to be invincible, and victorious over
   every foe. And from all this we are taught, that it is God's method to
   exercise his children with a continual conflict, that, having one foot
   as it were in the grave, they may flee with alarm to hide themselves
   under his wings, where they malt abide in peace. Some translate the
   particle 'ph, aph, also, instead of anger, reading -- thou wilt also
   extend over mine; enemies, etc. But I have followed the more commonly
   received sense, as both fuller and more natural.

   8. Jehovah will recompense upon me, etc. The doubtfulness which
   attaches to the meaning of the verb gmr, gamar, throws an uncertainty
   over the whole sentence. Sometimes it signifies to repay, and, in
   general, to bestow, for it is often applied to free favors. [198] Yet
   the context would seem to require.another sense, since, when it is
   added as a reason, that Jehovah's mercy is everlasting, and that he
   will not forsake the works of his hands, the better sense would seem to
   be -- Jehovah will perform for me, that is, will continue to show that
   he cares for my safety, and will fully perfect what he has begun.
   Having once been delivered by an act of Divine mercy, he concludes that
   what had been done would be perfected, as God's nature is unchangeable,
   and he cannot divest himself of that goodness which belongs to him.
   There can be no doubt that the way to maintain good hope in danger is
   to fix our eyes upon the Divine goodness, on which our deliverance
   rests. God is under no obligation on his part, but when, of his mere
   good pleasure, he promises to interest himself in our behalf. David
   concludes with the best reason, from the eternity of the Divine
   goodness, that the salvation granted him would be of no limited and
   merely evanescent character. This he confirms still farther by what he
   adds, that it is impossible God should leave his work, as men may do,
   in an imperfect or unfinished state through lassitude or disgust. This
   David is to be understood as asserting in the same sense in which Paul
   declares, that "the gifts and calling of God are without repentance."
   (Romans 11:29.) Men may leave off a work for very slight reasons which
   they foolishly undertook from the first, and from which they may have
   been diverted through their inconstancy, or they may be forced to give
   up through inability what they enterprised above their strength; but
   nothing of this kind can happen with God, and, therefore, we have no
   occasion to apprehend that our hopes will be disappointed in their
   course towards fulfillment. Nothing but sin and ingratitude on our part
   interrupts the continued and unvarying tenor of the Divine goodness.
   What we firmly apprehend by our faith God will never take from us, or
   allow to pass out of our hands. When he declares that God perfects the
   salvation of his people, David would not encourage sloth, but
   strengthen his faith and quicken himself to the exercise of prayer.
   What is the cause of that anxiety and fear which are felt by the godly,
   but the consciousness of their own weakness and entire dependence upon
   God? At the same time they rely with full certainty upon the grace of
   God, "being confident," as Paul writes to the Philippians,

   "that he who has begun the good work will perform it till the day of
   Christ Jesus." (Philippians 1:6.)

   The use to be made of the doctrine is, to remember, when we fall or are
   disposed to waver in our minds, that since God has wrought the
   beginning of our salvation in us, he will carry it forward to its
   termination. Accordingly, we should betake ourselves to prayer, that we
   may not, through our own indolence, bar our access to that continuous
   stream of the divine goodness which flows from a fountain that is
   inexhaustible.

   PSALM 139

   In this Psalm David, that he may dismiss the deceptive coverings under
   which most men take refuge, and divest himself of hypocrisy, insists at
   large upon the truth that nothing can elude the divine observation -- a
   truth which he illustrates from the original formation of man, since he
   who fashioned us in our mother's womb, and imparted to every member its
   particular office and function, cannot possibly be ignorant of our
   actions. Quickened by this meditation to a due reverential fear of God,
   he declares himself to have no sympathy with the ungodly and profane,
   and beseeches God, in the confidence of conscious integrity, not to
   forsake him in this life. [199]

   To the chief Musician, a Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 139:1-6

   1. O Jehovah! thou hast searched me, and knowest me. 2. Thou hast known
   my downsitting and mine uprising, thou understandest my thought afar
   off. 3. Thou besiegest my path, and my lying clown, and art acquainted
   with all my ways. 4. For there is not a word in my tongue, but lo! O
   Lord! Thou knowest it altogether. 5. Thou hast shut me up behind and
   before, and hast laid thine hand upon me. 6. Thy knowledge is wonderful
   above me: [200] it is high, I cannot attain to it.


   1. O Jehovah! thou hast searched me David declares, in the outset of
   this Psalm, that he does not come before God with any idea of its being
   possible to succeed by dissimulation, as hypocrites will take advantage
   of secret refuges to prosecute sinful indulgences, but that he
   voluntarily lays bare his innermost heart for inspection, as one
   convinced of the impossibility of deceiving God. It is thine, he says,
   O God! to discover every secret thought, nor is there anything which
   can escape thy notice, He then insists upon particulars, to show that
   his whole life was known to God, who watched him in all his motions --
   when he slept, when he arose, or when he walked abroad. The word r,
   rea, which we have rendered thought, signifies also a friend or
   companion, on which account some read -- thou knowest what is nearest
   me afar off, a meaning more to the point than any other, if it could be
   supported by example. The reference would then be very appropriately to
   the fact that the most distant objects are contemplated as near by God.
   Some for afar off read beforehand, in which signification the Hebrew
   word is elsewhere taken, as if he had said -- O Lord, every thought
   which I conceive in my heart is already known to thee beforehand. But I
   prefer the other meaning, That God is not confined to heaven, indulging
   in a state of repose, and indifferent to human concerns, according to
   the Epicurean idea, and that however far off we may be from him, he is
   never far off from us.

   The verb zrh, zarah, means to winnow as well as to compass, so that we
   may very properly read the third verse -- thou winnowest my ways, [201]
   a figurative expression to denote the bringing of anything which is
   unknown to light. The reader is left to his own option, for the other
   rendering which I have adopted is also.appropriate. There has been also
   a difference of opinion amongst interpreters as to the last clause of
   the verse. The verb skn, sachan, in the Hiphil conjugation, as here,
   signifies to render successful, which has led some to think that David
   here thanks God for crowning his actions with success; but this is a
   sense which does not at all suit the scope of the Psalmist in the
   context, for he is not speaking of thanksgiving. Equally forced is the
   meaning given to the words by others -- Thou hast made me to get
   acquainted or accustomed with my ways; [202] as if he praised God for
   being endued with wisdom and counsel. Though the verb be in the Hiphil,
   I have therefore felt no hesitation in assigning it a neuter
   signification -- Lord, thou art accustomed to my ways, so that they are
   familiar to thee.

   4. For there is not a word, etc. The words admit a double meaning.
   Accordingly some understand them to imply that God knows what, we are
   about to say before the words are formed on our tongue; others, that
   though we speak not a word, and try by silence to conceal our secret
   intentions, we cannot elude his notice. Either rendering amounts to the
   same thing, and it is of no consequence which we adopt. The idea meant
   to be conveyed is, that while the tongue is the index of thought to
   man, being the great medium of communication, God, who knows the heart,
   is independent of words. And use is made of the demonstrative particle
   lo! to indicate emphatically that the innermost recesses of our spirit
   stand present to his view.

   In verse fifth some read -- behind and before thou hast fashioned me;
   [203] but tsvr, tsur, often signifies to shut up, and David, there can
   be no doubt, means that he was surrounded on every side, and so kept in
   sight by God, that he could not escape in any quarter. One who finds
   the way blocked up turns back; but David found himself hedged in behind
   as well as before. The other clause of the verse has the same meaning;
   for those put a very forced interpretation upon it who think that it
   refers to God's fashioning us, and applying his hand in the sense of an
   artizan to his work; nor does this suit with the context. And it is
   much better to understand it as asserting that God by his hand, laid as
   it were upon men, holds them strictly under his inspection, so that
   they cannot move a hair's breadth without his knowledge. [204]

   6. Thy knowledge is wonderful above me Two meanings may be attached to
   mmny: mimmenni. We may read upon me, or, in relation to me, and
   understand David to mean that God's knowledge is seen to be wonderful
   in forming such a creature as man, who, to use an old saying', may be
   called a little world in himself; nor can we think without astonishment
   of the consummate artifice apparent in the structure of the human body,
   and of the excellent endowments with which the human soul is invested.
   But the context demands another interpretation; and we are to suppose
   that David, prosecuting the same idea upon which he had already
   insisted, exclaims against the folly of measuring God's knowledge by
   our own, when it rises prodigiously above us. Many when they hear God
   spoken of conceive of him as like unto themselves, and such presumption
   is most condemnable. Very commonly they will not allow his knowledge to
   be greater than what comes up to their own apprehensions of things.
   David, on the contrary, confesses it to be beyond his comprehension,
   virtually declaring that words could not express this truth of the
   absoluteness with which all things stand patent to the eye of God, this
   being a knowledge having' neither bound nor measure, so that he could
   only contemplate the extent of it with conscious imbecility.

   [200] "C'est par dessus moy et ma capacite." -- Fr. Marg. "That is,
   above me and my capacity."

   [201] Piscator, Campensis, Pagninus, Luther, and our English Version,
   read "thou compassest." This no doubt gives the meaning, of the
   original, though not the precise idea, which is noticed on the margin
   of our English Bible to be "winnowest." The verb zrh, zarah, employed,
   signifies to disperse, to fan, to ventilate, to winnow; and here it
   denotes that as men separate the corn from the chaff, so God separates
   between, or investigates, the good and the bad in the daily conduct of
   men. Hence the Septuagint reads exichniasas, "thou hast investigated."
   Bishop Hare, who renders "thou dost compass," supposes it to be a
   metaphor taken from hunting. "Winnowing," says Archbishop Secker,"
   would sound uncouth But Mudge hath hit on the word siftest, which,
   though an idea somewhat different, suits very well."

   [202] "Fecisti assuescere vias meas." -- Lat.

   [203] Thus the Septuagint have eplasas me, Thou hast formed me. Similar
   is the rendering of the Syriac. Those who embrace this view take the
   verb, as if the root were ytsr, yatsar. "But," says Phillips, "it is
   certain that the root of tsrtny must be tsvr, to afflict, press,
   besiege. Hence the meaning of the verse is, Thou hast so pressed upon,
   or besieged me, both behind and before, that I find there is no
   escaping from thee; Thou hast placed thy hand upon me, so that I am
   quite in thy power.' The whole passage is a figure, representing God's
   thorough knowledge of man." -- Phillips. "Thou besettest me behind and
   before, i.e. thou knowest all my doings as perfectly as if I were
   begirt by thee on every side." -- Cresswell.

   Psalm 139:7-12

   7. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? rind whither shall flee from thy
   face? 8. If I ascend up into heaters, thou art there; if I lie down in
   the sepulcher, lo! thou art there. 9. Shall I take the wings of the
   morning, that I may dwell in the uttermost parts of the sea? 10. Even
   there shall thy hand lead me, and thy right hand shall hold me. 11. If
   I shall say; at least the darkness shall cover me, and the night shall
   be light for me; 12. Even the darkness shall not hide from thee, and
   the night shall be lightened up as day, and darkness as the light.


   7. Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? I consider that David prosecutes
   the same idea of its being' impossible that men by any subterfuge
   should elude the eye of God. By the Spirit of God we are not here, as
   in several other parts of Scripture, to conceive of his power merely,
   but his understanding and knowledge. [205] In man the spirit is the
   seat of intelligence, and so it is here in reference to God, as is
   plain from the second part of the sentence, where by the face of God is
   meant his knowledge or inspection. David means in short that he could
   not change from one place to another without God seeing him, and
   following him with his eyes as he moved. They misapply the passage who
   adduce it as a proof of the immensity of God's essence; for though it
   be an undoubted truth that the glory of the Lord fills heaven and
   earth, this was not at present in the view of the Psalmist, but the
   truth that God's eye penetrates heaven and hell, so that, hide in what
   obscure corner of the world he might, he must be discovered by him.
   Accordingly he tells us that though he should fly to heaven, or lurk in
   the lowest abysses, from above or from below all was naked and manifest
   before God. The wings of the morning, [206] or of Lucifer, is a
   beautiful metaphor, for when the sun rises on the earth, it transmits
   its radiance suddenly to all regions of the world, as with the
   swiftness of flight. The same figure is employed in Malachi 4:2. And
   the idea is, that though one should fly with the speed of light, he
   could find no recess where he would be beyond the reach of divine
   power. For by hand we are to understand power, and the assertion is to
   the effect that should man attempt to withdraw from the observation of
   God, it were easy for him to arrest and draw back the fugitive. [207]

   11. If I shall say, etc. David represents himself as a man using every
   possible method to make his escape from a situation of embarrassment.
   So having acknowledged that it was vain to dream of flight, he bethinks
   himself of another remedy, and says, If no speed of mine can bear me
   out of the range of God's vision, yet, on the supposition of light
   being removed, the darkness might cover me, that I might have a short
   breath of respite. But this also he declares to be hopeless, as God
   sees equally well in the deepest darkness as at noon-day. It is a
   mistake in my opinion to consider, as some have done, that the two
   clauses of the verse are to be taken separately, and read, If I shall
   say the darkness will cover me, even the night shall be as light before
   me -- meaning that darkness would be converted into light, and so
   though he saw nothing himself, he would stand manifest before the eye
   of God. David is rather to be considered as in both clauses expressing
   what he might be supposed to feel desirous of, and intimates that,
   could he only find any covert or subterfuge, he would avail himself of
   the license; [208] "if I shall say, at least the darkness will cover
   me, and the night be as light for me," that is, in the sense in which
   it is so to the robbers or wild beasts of the forest, who then range at
   greater liberty. That this is the proper construction of the words we
   may infer from the particle gm, gam. If any one should think it a very
   unnecessary observation to say that as respects God there is no
   difference between light and darkness, it is enough to remind him that
   all observation proves with what reluctance and extreme difficulty men
   are brought to come forward openly and unreservedly into God's
   presence. In words we all grant that God is omniscient; meanwhile what
   none would ever think of controverting we secretly make no account of
   whatsoever, in so far as we make no scruple of mocking God, and lack
   even that reverence of him which we extend to one of our
   fellow-creatures. We are ashamed to let men know and witness our
   delinquencies; but we are as indifferent to what God may think of us,
   as if our sins were covered and veiled from his inspection. This
   infatuation if not sharply reproved will soon change light, so far as
   we are concerned, into darkness, and therefore David insists upon the
   subject at length in order to refute our false apprehensions. Be it our
   concern to apply the reproofs given, and stir ourselves up by them,
   when we feel disposed to become secure.

   Psalm 139:13-16

   13. For thou hast possessed [209] my reins; thou hast covered me [210]
   in my mother's womb, 14. I will praise thee; for I have been made
   wonderful terribly; marvellous are thy works, and my soul shall know
   them well. 15. My strength is not hid from thee, [211] which thou hast
   made in secret: I was woven together in the lowest parts of the earth.
   16. Thine eyes did see my shapelessness; all are written in thy book,
   they were formed by days, and not one of them.


   13. For thou hast possessed my reins Apparently he prosecutes the same
   subject, though he carries it out somewhat farther, declaring that we
   need not be surprised at God's knowledge of the most secret thoughts of
   men, since he formed their hearts and their reins. He thus represents
   God as sitting king in the very reins of man, as the center of his
   jurisdiction, and shows it ought to be no ground of wonder that all the
   windings and recesses of our hearts are known to him who, when we were
   inclosed in our mother's womb, saw us as clearly and perfectly as if we
   had stood before him in the light of mid-day. This may let us know the
   design with which David proceeds to speak of man's original formation,
   its scope is the same in the verse which follows, where, with some
   ambiguity in the terms employed, it is sufficiently clear and obvious
   that David means that he had been fashioned in a manner wonderful, and
   calculated to excite both fear and admiration, [212] so that he breaks
   forth into the praises of God. One great reason of the carnal security
   into which we fall, is our not considering how singularly we were
   fashioned at first by our Divine Maker. From this particular instance
   David is led to refer in general to all the works of God, which are
   just so many wonders fitted to draw our attention to him. The true and
   proper view to take of the works of God, as I have observed elsewhere,
   is that which ends in wonder. His declaration to the effect that his
   soul should well know these wonders, which far transcend human
   comprehension, means no more than that with humble and sober
   application he would give his attention and talents to obtaining such
   an apprehension of the wonderful works of God as might end in adoring
   the immensity of his glory. The knowledge he means, therefore, is not
   that which professes to comprehend what, under the name of wonders, he
   confesses to be incomprehensible, nor of that kind which philosophers
   presumptuously pretend to, as if they could solve every mystery of God,
   but simply that religious attention to the works of God which excites
   to the duty of thanksgiving.

   15. My strength was not hid from thee That nothing is hid from God
   David now begins to prove from the way in which man is at first formed,
   and points out God's superiority to other artificers in this, that
   while they must have their work set before their eyes before they can
   form it, he fashioned us in our mother's womb. It is of little
   importance whether we read my strength or my bone, though I prefer the
   latter reading. He next likens the womb of the mother to the lowest
   caverns or recesses of the earth. Should an artizan intend commencing a
   work in some dark cave where there was no light to assist him, how
   would he set his hand to it? in what way would he proceed? and what
   kind of workmanship would it prove? [213] But God makes the most
   perfect work of all in the dark, for he fashions man in mother's womb.
   The verb rqm, rakam, which means weave together, [214] is employed to
   amplify and enhance what the Psalmist had just said. David no doubt
   means figuratively to express the inconceivable skill which appears in
   the formation of the human body. When we examine it, even to the nails
   on our fingers, there is nothing which could be altered, without felt
   inconveniency, as at something disjointed or put out of place; and
   what, then, if we should make the individual parts the subject of
   enumeration? [215] Where is the embroiderer who -- with all his
   industry and ingenuity -- could execute the hundredth part of this
   complicate and diversified structure? We need not then wonder if God,
   who formed man so perfectly in the womb, should have an exact knowledge
   of him after he is ushered into the world.

   16. Thine eyes beheld my shapelessness, etc. The embryo, when first
   conceived in the womb, has no form; and David speaks of God's having
   known him when he was yet a shapeless mass, to kuema, as the Greeks
   term it; for to embruon is the name given to the foetus from the time
   of conception to birth inclusive. The argument is from the greater' to
   the less. If he was known to God before he had grown to certain
   definite shape, much less could he now elude his observation. He adds,
   that all things were written in his book; that is, the whole method of
   his formation was well known to God. The term book is a figure taken
   from the practice common amongst men of helping their memory by means
   of books and commentaries. Whatever is an object of God's knowledge he
   is said to have registered in writing, for he needs no helps to memory.
   Interpreters are not agreed as to the second clause. Some read ymym,
   yamim, in the nominative case, when days were made; the sense being,
   according to them -- All my bones were written in thy book, O God! from
   the beginning of the world, when days were first formed by thee, and
   when as yet none of them actually existed. The other is the more
   natural meaning, That the different parts of the human body are formed
   in a succession of time; for in the first germ there is no arrangement
   of parts, or proportion of members, but it is developed, and takes its
   peculiar form progressively. [216] There is another point on which
   interpreters differ. As in the particle l', lo, the ', aleph, is often
   interchangeable with v vau; some read lv, to him, and others l' not.
   According to the first reading, the sense is, that though the body is
   formed progressively, it was always one and the same in God's book, who
   is not dependent upon time for the execution of his work. A
   sufficiently good meaning, however, can be got by adhering' without
   change to the negative particle, namely, that though the members were
   formed in the course of days, or gradually, none of them had existed;
   no order or distinctness of parts having been there at first, but a
   formless substance. And thus our admiration is directed to the
   providence of God in gradually giving' shape and beauty to a confused
   mass. [217]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [209] "The usual signification of qnh is, to possess, to acquire; but
   here it is thought to contain the notion of forming, or creating. The
   reason of this difference in the sense may be accounted for from the
   circumstance, that in Arabic there are two verbs to which qnh may
   correspond, viz., one to possess, and another to form. So in Genesis
   14:19, God is said to be the possessor (qnh) of heaven and earth.' The
   Septuagint for qnh, reads hos ektise, who created, and the Vulgate, qui
   creavit Again in Proverbs 8:22, for qnny the Chaldee has vr'ny, hath
   begotten, or created me. From these and other passages it is evident
   that qnh was supposed by the ancient interpreters to have the sense of
   to form, or create; and this meaning seems to be required in the verse
   before us, which comports with the next verb." -- Phillips.

   [210] The "covering" here spoken of, is illustrated by Job 10:2, where
   God is said to have "clothed us with skin and flesh, and fenced us with
   bones and sinews." "A work so astonishing," observes Bishop Horne,
   "that before the Psalmist proceeds in his description of it, he cannot
   help breaking forth in rapture at the thought: I will praise thee, for!
   I am fearfully and wonderfully made.'"

   [211] "Ou, mon os n'est point cache de toy." -- Fr. marg. "Or, my bone
   is not hid from thee."

   [212] "Fearfully and wonderfully made Never was so terse and expressive
   a description of the physical conformation of man given by any human
   being. So fearfully are we made, that there is not an action or gesture
   of our bodies, which does not, apparently, endanger some muscle, vein,
   or sinew, the rupture of which would destroy either life or health. We
   are so wonderfully made, that our organization infinitely surpasses, in
   skill, contrivance, design, and adaptation of means to ends, the most
   curious and complicated piece of mechanism, not only ever executed by
   art and man's device, but ever conceived by the human imagination." --
   Warner.

   [213] "The figure," says Walford, "is derived from the darkness and
   obscurity of caverns and other recesses of the earth."

   [214] "rqm is to embroider.'" -- Phillips. Mant translates the verse
   thus: -- "By all, but not by thee unknown,
   My substance grew, and, o'er it thrown,
   The fine-wrought web from nature's loom,
   All wove in secret and in gloom." And after observing that the foetus
   is gradually formed and matured for the birth, like plants and flowers
   under ground, he adds -- "The process is compared to that in a piece of
   work wrought with a needle, or fashioned in the loom: which, with all
   its beautiful variety of color, and proportion of figure, ariseth by
   degrees to perfection, under the hand of the artist, framed according
   to a pattern lying before him, from a rude mass of silk, or other
   materials. Thus, by the power and wisdom of God, and after a plan
   delineated in his book, is a shapeless mass wrought up into the most
   curious texture of nerves, veins, arteries, bones, muscles, membranes,
   and skin, most skilfully interwoven and connected with each other,
   until it becometh a body harmoniously diversified with all the limbs
   and lineaments of a man, not one of which at first appeared, any more
   than the figures were to be seen in the ball of silk. But then, which
   is the chief thing here insisted on by the Psalmist, whereas the human
   artificer must have the clearest light whereby to accomplish his task,
   the divine work-master seeth in secret, and effecteth all his wonders
   within the dark and narrow confines of the womb." Bishop Lowth supposes
   that the full force and beauty of the metaphor in this passage will not
   be understood, unless it is perceived that the Psalmist alludes to the
   art of embroidery as consecrated by the Jews to sacred purposes, in
   decorating the garments of the priests and the curtains at the entrance
   of the tabernacle. "In that most perfect ode, Psalm 139," says he,
   "which celebrates the immensity of the omnipresent Deity, and the
   wisdom of the divine artificer in forming the human body, the author
   uses a metaphor derived from the most subtle art of Phrygian workmen:
   When I was formed in the secret place,
   When I was wrought with a needle in the depths of the earth. Whoever
   observes this, (in truth he will not be able to observe it in the
   common translations,)and at the same time reflects upon the wonderful
   mechanism of the human body, the various amplifications of the veins,
   arteries, fibres, and membranes; the indescribable texture' of the
   whole fabric; may indeed feel the beauty and gracefulness of this
   well-adapted metaphor, but will miss much of its force and sublimity,
   unless he be apprised that the art of designing in needle-work was
   wholly dedicated to the use of the sanctuary, and by a direct precept
   of the divine law, chiefly employed in furnishing' a part of the
   sacerdotal habits, and the veils for the entrance of the tabernacle.
   (Exodus 28:39; Exodus 26:36; Exodus 27:16; compare Ezekiel 16:10, 13,
   18.) Thus the poet compares the wisdom of the divine artificer with the
   most estimable of human arts -- that art which was dignified by being
   consecrated altogether to the use of religion; and the workmanship of
   which was so exquisite, that even the sacred writings seem to attribute
   it to a supernatural guidance. See Exodus 35:30-35 " -- Lowth's
   Lectures on the Sacred Poetry of the Hebrews, volume 1.

   [215] "Que sera-ce donc quand on viendra a contempler par le menu
   chacune partie?" -- Fr.

   [216] "They (my members) have been daily formed, or forming. They were
   not formed at once, but gradually; each day increasing in strength and
   size. This expression is probably parenthetical, so that the last words
   of the verse will refer to the writing of those things previously
   mentioned in God's register." -- Phillips.

   [217] "The meaning is," says Warner, "there was a time when none of
   those curious parts, of which my form consists, existed. The germ of
   them all was planted by thee in the first instance; and gradually
   matured, by thy power, wisdom, and goodness, into that wonderful piece
   of mechanism which the human form exhibits." Phillips gives a different
   turn to the clause: "And not one of them, or among them, was omitted.
   Not one of the particulars concerning my formation has been left out of
   thy record."

   Psalm 139:17-18

   17. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me, O God! how great the
   sums of them! 18. If I should count them, they shall be multiplied
   above the sand: I have awaked, and am still with thee.


   17. How precious also are thy thoughts unto me It is the same Hebrew
   word, rh, reah, which is used here as in the second verse, and means
   thought, not companion or friend, as many have rendered it, after the
   Chaldee translator, under the idea that the Psalmist is already
   condescending upon the distinction between the righteous and the
   wicked. The context requires that he should still be considered as
   speaking of the matchless excellence of divine providence. He therefore
   repeats -- and not without reason -- what he had said before; for we
   apparently neglect or underestimate the singular proofs of the deep
   wisdom of God, exhibited in man's creation, and the whole
   superintendence and government of his life. Some read -- How rare are
   thy thoughts; but this only darkens the meaning. I grant we find that
   word made use of in the Sacred History, (1 Samuel 3:1,) where the
   oracles of the Lord are said to have been rare, in the time of Eli. But
   it also means precious, and it is enough that we retain the sense which
   is free from all ambiguity. He applies the term to God's thoughts, as
   not lying within the compass of man's judgment. To the same effect is
   what he adds that the sums or aggregates of them were great and mighty;
   that is, sufficient to overwhelm the minds of men. The exclamation made
   by the Psalmist suggests to us that were men not so dull of
   apprehension, or rather so senseless, they would be struck by the
   mysterious ways of God, and would humbly and tremblingly sit themselves
   before his tribunal, instead of presumptuously thinking that they could
   evade it. The same truth is set forth in the next verse, that if any
   should attempt to number the hidden judgments or counsels of God, their
   immensity is more than the sands of the sea. Our capacities conseqently
   could not comprehend the most infinitesimal part of them. As to what
   follows -- I have a waked, and am still with, thee, interpreters have
   rendered the words differently; but I have no doubt of the meaning
   simply being that David found new occasion, every time he awoke from
   sleep, for meditating upon the extraordinary wisdom of God. When he
   speaks of rising, we are not to suppose he refers to one day, but
   agreeably to what he had said already of his thoughts being absorbed in
   the incomprehensible greatness of divine wisdom, he adds that every
   time he awoke he discovered fresh matter for admiration. We are thus
   put in possession of the true meaning of David, to the effect that
   God's providential government of the world is such that nothing can
   escape him, not even the profoundest thoughts. And although many
   precipitate themselves in an infatuated manner into all excess of
   crime, under the idea that God will never discover them, it is in vain
   that they resort to hiding-places, from which, however reluctantly,
   they must be dragged to light. The truth is one which we would do well
   to consider more than we do, for while we may cast a glance at our
   hands and our feet, and occasionally survey the elegance of our shape
   with complacency, there is scarcely one in a hundred who thinks of his
   Maker. Or if any recognize their life as coming from God, there is none
   at least who rises to the great truth that he who formed the ear, and
   the eye, and the understanding heart, himself hears, and sees, and
   knows everything.

   Psalm 139:19-24

   19. If thou shalt slay, O God! the wicked, then depart from me, ye
   bloody men. 20. Who have spoken of thee wickedly, thine adversaries
   have taken [thy name] falsely. 21. Shall not I hold in hatred those
   that hate thee, O Jehovah! And strive with those that rise up against
   thee? 22. I have hated them with perfect hatred; they were to me for
   enemies. [218] 23. Search me, O God! and know my heart: try me, and
   know my thoughts; 24. And know whether the way of wickedness be in me,
   and lead me throughout the way of this life. [219]


   19. If thou shalt slay, etc. It is unnatural to seek, as some have
   done, to connect this with the preceding verse. Nor does it seem proper
   to view the words as expressing a wish -- "I wish," or, "Oh! if thou
   God wouldst slay the wicked." Neither can I subscribe to the idea of
   those who think that David congratulates himself upon the wicked being
   cut off. The sentiment seems to me to be of another kind, that he would
   apply himself to the consideration of the divine judgments, and advance
   in godliness and in the fear of his name, so often as vengeance was
   taken upon the ungodly. There can be no question that God designs to
   make an example of them, that his elect ones may be taught by their
   punishment to withdraw themselves from their society. David was of
   himself well disposed to the fear and worship of God, and yet he needed
   a certain check, like other saints, as Isaiah says, (Isaiah 26:9,)
   "when God has sent abroad his judgments, the inhabitants of the earth
   shall learn righteousness," that is, to remain in the fear of the Lord.
   At the same time, I have no doubt that the Psalmist presents himself
   before God as witness of his integrity; as if he had said, that he came
   freely and ingenuously to God's bar, as not being one of the wicked
   despisers of his name, nor having any connection with them.

   20. Who have spoken of thee wickedly. He intimates the extent to which
   the wicked proceed when God spares them, and forbears to visit them
   with vengeance. They not merely conclude that they may perpetrate any
   crime with impunity, but openly blaspheme their Judge. He takes notice
   of their speaking wickedly, in the sense of their taking no pains to
   disguise their sin under plausible pretences, as persons who have some
   shame remaining will exercise a certain restraint upon their language,
   but they make no secret of the contempt they entertain for God. The
   second clause, where he speaks of their taking God's name falsely, some
   have interpreted too restrictedly with reference to their sin of
   perjury. Those come nearer the truth who consider that the wicked are
   spoken of as taking God's name in vain, when they conceive of him
   according to their own idle fancies. We see from experience, that most
   men are ignorant of what God is, and judge of him rather as one dead
   than alive. In words they all acknowledge him to be judge of the world,
   but the acknowledgment comes to nothing, as they straightway denude him
   of his office of judgment, which is to take God's name in vain, by
   tarnishing the glory of it, and, in a manner, deforming it. But as name
   is not in the original, and ns', nasa, means to lift Up, or on high, I
   think we are warranted rather to interpret the passage as meaning',
   that they carried themselves with an arrogant and false pride. This
   elation or haughtiness of spirit is almost always allied with that
   petulance of which he had previously taken notice. What other reason
   can be given for their vending such poisonous rancour against God, but
   pride, and forgetfulness, on the one hand, of their own insignificance
   as men, and on the other, of the power which belongeth unto the Lord?
   On this account he calls them God's adversaries, for all who exalt
   themselves above the place which they should occupy, act the part of
   the giants who warred against heaven.

   21. Shall I not hold in hatred those that hate thee? He proceeds to
   mention how greatly he had profited by the meditation upon God into
   which he had been led, for, as the effect, of his having realized his
   presence before God's bar, and reflected upon the impossibility of
   escaping the eye of him who searches all deep places, he now lays down
   his resolution to lead a holy and pious life. In declaring his hatred
   of those who despised God, he virtually asserts thereby his own
   integrity, not as being free from all sin, but as being devoted to
   godliness, so that he detested in his heart everything which was
   contrary to it. Our attachment to godliness must be inwardly defective,
   if it do not generate an abhorrence of sin, such as David here speaks
   of. If that zeal for the house of the Lord, which he mentions
   elsewhere, (Psalm 69:9,) burn in our hearts, it would be an
   unpardonable indifference silently to look on when his righteous law
   was violated, nay, when his holy name was trampled upon by the wicked.
   As to the last word in the verse, qvt, kut, means to dispute with, or
   contend, and may be understood as here retaining' the same sense in the
   Hithpael conjugation, unless we consider David to have more
   particularly meant, that he inflamed himself so as to stir up his mind
   to contend with them. We thus see that he stood forward strenuously in
   defense of the glory of God, regardless of the hatred of the whole
   world, and waged war with all the workers of iniquity.

   22. I hate them with perfect hatred. Literally it is, I hate them with
   perfection of hatred. He repeats the same truth as formerly, that such
   was his esteem for God's glory that he would have nothing' in common
   with those who despised him. He means in general that he gave no
   countenance to the works of darkness, for whoever connives at sin and
   encourages it through silence, wickedly betrays God's cause, who has
   committed the vindication of righteousness into our hands. David's
   example should teach us to rise with a lofty and bold spirit above all
   regard to the enmity of the wicked, when the question concerns the
   honor of God, and rather to renounce all earthly friendships than
   falsely pander with flattery to the favor of those who do everything to
   draw down upon themselves the divine displeasure. We have the more need
   to attend to this, because the keen sense we have of what concerns our
   private interest, honor, and convenience, makes us never hesitate to
   engage in contest when any one injures ourselves, while we are
   abundantly timid and cowardly in defending the glory of God. Thus, as
   each of us studies his own interest and advantage, the only thing which
   incites us to contention, strife, and war, is a desire to avenge our
   private wrongs; none is affected when the majesty of God is outraged.
   On the other hand, it is a proof of our having a fervent zeal for God
   when we have the magnanimity to declare irreconcilable war with the
   wicked and them who hate God, rather than court their favor at the
   expense of alienating the divine layout. We are to observe, however,
   that the hatred of which the Psalmist speaks is directed to the sins
   rather than the persons of the wicked. We are, so far as lies in us, to
   study peace with all men; we are to seek the good of all, and, if
   possible, they are to be reclaimed by kindness and good offices: only
   so far as they are enemies to God we must strenuously confront their
   resentment.

   23. Search me, O God! He insists upon this as being the only cause why
   he opposed the despisers of God, that he himself was a genuine
   worshipper of God, and desired others to possess the same character. It
   indicates no common confidence that he should submit, himself so boldly
   to the judgment of God. But being fully conscious of sincerity in his
   religion, it was not without due consideration that he placed himself
   so confidently before God's bar; neither must we think that he claims
   to be free from all sin, for he groaned under the felt burden of his
   transgressions. The saints in all that they say of their integrity
   still depend only upon free grace. Yet persuaded as they are that their
   godliness is approved before God, notwithstanding their falls and
   infirmities, we need not wonder that (hey feel themselves at freedom to
   draw a distinction between themselves and the wicked. While he denies
   that his heart was double or insincere, he does not profess exemption
   from all sin, but only that he was not devoted to wickedness; for tsv,
   otseb, does not mean any sin whatever, but grief, trouble, or pravity
   -- and sometimes metaphorically an idol. [220] But the last of these
   meanings will not apply here, for David asserts his freedom not from
   superstition merely, but unrighteousness, as elsewhere it is said,
   (Isaiah 59:7,) that in the ways of such men there is "trouble and
   destruction," because they carry everything by violence and wickedness.
   Others think the allusion is to a bad conscience, which afflicts the
   wicked with inward torments, but this is a forced interpretation.
   Whatever sense we attach to the word, David's meaning simply is, that
   though he was a man subject to sin, he was not devotedly bent upon the
   practice of it.

   24. And lead me, etc. I see no foundation for the opinion of some that
   this is an imprecation, and that David adjudges himself over to
   punishment. It is true, that "the way of all the earth" is an
   expression used sometimes to denote death, which is common to all, but
   the verb here translated to lead is more commonly taken in a good than
   a bad sense, and I question if the phrase way of this life ever means
   death. [221] It seems evidently to denote the full continuous term of
   human life, and David prays God to guide him even to the end of his
   course. I am aware some understand it to refer to eternal life, nor is
   it denied that the world to come is comprehended under the full term of
   life to which the Psalm~ ist alludes, but it seems enough to hold by
   the plain sense of the words, That God would watch over his servant to
   whom he had already shown kindness to the end, and not forsake him in
   the midst of his days.

     __________________________________________________________________

   [199] This Psalm has often been admired for the grandeur of its
   sentiments, the elevation of its style, as well as the variety and
   beauty of its imagery. Bishop Lowth, in his 29th Prelection, classes it
   amongst the Hebrew idyls, as next to the 104th, in respect both to the
   conduct of the poem, and the beauty of the style. "If it be excelled,"
   says he, "(as perhaps it is) by the former in the plan, disposition,
   and arrangement of the matter, it is not in the least inferior in the
   dignity and elegance of its sentiments, images, and figures." "Amongst
   its other excellencies," says Bishop Mant, "it is for nothing more
   admirable than for the exquisite skill with which it descants on the
   perfections of the Deity. The Psalmist's faith in the omnipresence and
   omniscience of Jehovah is in the commencement depicted · with a
   singular and beautiful variety of the most lively expressions: nor can
   anything be more sublime than that accummulation of the noblest and
   loftiest images, in the 7th and following verses, commensurate with the
   limits of created nature, whereby the Psalmist labors to impress upon
   the mind some notion of the infinity of God." If we compare this sacred
   poem with any hymn of classical antiquity in honor of the heathen
   deities, the immense superiority of the sentiments it contains must
   convince any reasonable person that David and the Israelites, though
   inferior in other respects to some other nations, surpassed them in
   religious knowledge. No philosopher of ancient times ever attained to
   such sublime views of the perfections and moral government of God as
   the Hebrew Prophets. How are we to account for this difference but on
   the supposition of the divine origin of the religion of the Hebrews? On
   any other supposition these Psalms are a greater miracle than any of
   those recorded by Moses. Bishop Horsley refers the composition of this
   Psalm to a later age than that of David. "The frequent Chaldaisms,"
   says he, "of the diction, argue no very high antiquity." Dr. Adam
   Clarke, on the same ground, argues that it was; not written by the
   sweet singer of Israel, but during or after the time of the captivity.
   Other critics, however, maintain that the several Chaldaisms to be
   found in it afford no foundation for such an opinion. "How any critic,"
   says Jebb, "can assign this Psalm to other than David, I cannot
   understand. Every line, every thought, every turn of expression and
   transition is his, and his only. As for the arguments drawn from the
   two Chaldaisms which occur, (rvy for rvtsy, and ryk for tsryk,) this is
   really nugatory. These Chaldaisms consist merely in the substitution of
   one letter for another very like it in shape, and easily to be mistaken
   by a transcriber, particularly by one who had been used to the Chaldee
   idiom: but the moral arguments for David's author-ship are so strong as
   to overwhelm.'my such verbal or rather literal criticism, were even the
   objections more formidable than they actually are." -- Jebb's Literal
   Translation of the Psalms, etc., volume 2.

   PSALM 140

   David complains of the implacable cruelty of his enemies, and of their
   treachery and rancorous calumnies. In the close, having besought God's
   help, and expressing his persuasion of obtaining his layout, he
   comforts himself with the hope of deliverance, and just vengeance being
   executed upon his enemies.

   To the chief Musician -- A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 140:1-5

   1. Deliver me, O Jehovah! from the evil man, (homo,) preserve me from
   the man (vir) [222] of injuries. 2. Who imagine mischiefs in their
   heart; daily they congregate for war. 3. They have sharpened their
   tongue like a serpent: [223] the poison of an asp [224] is under their
   lips. Selah 4. Keep us, O Jehovah! from the hands of the wicked:
   preserve me from the man of injuries, who plot to overthrow my goings.
   5. The proud have set a snare for me, and have spread a net with cords:
   by the way side they have set gins for me. [225] Selah


   To the chief Musician, etc. I cannot bring myself to restrict this
   Psalm to Doeg, as the great body of interpreters do, for the context
   will clearly show that it speaks of Saul, and of the counselors who
   ceased not to inflame the king -- himself sufficiently incensed against
   the life of one who was a saint of God. Being as he was a figure of
   Christ, we need not wonder that the agents of the devil directed so
   much of their rage against him. And this is the reason why he
   animadverts so sharply upon their rancor and treachery.

   The terms wicked and violent men denote their unwarranted attempts at
   his destruction without provocation given. He therefore commends his
   cause to God, as having studied peace with them, as never having
   injured them, but being the innocent object of their unjust
   persecution. The same rule must be observed by us all, as it is against
   violence and wickedness that the help of God is extended. David is not
   Multiplying mere terms of reproach as men do in their personal
   disputes, but conciliating God's favor by supplying a proof of his
   innocence, for he must always be upon the side of good and peaceable
   men.

   2. Who imagine mischief's in their heart. Here he charges them with
   inward malignity of heart. And it is plain that the reference is not to
   one man merely, for he passes to the plural number (in a manner
   sufficiently common,) reverting from the head to all his associates and
   copartners in guilt. Indeed what was formerly said in the singular
   number may be taken indefinitely, as grammarians say. In general he
   repeats what I have noticed already, that the hostility to which he was
   subjected arose from no cause of his. From this we learn that the more
   wickedly our enemies assail us, and the more of treachery and
   clandestine acts they manifest, the nearer is the promised aid of the
   Holy Spirit, who himself dictated this form of prayer by the mouth of
   David. The second clause may be rendered in three ways. Literally it
   reads, who gather wars, and so some understand it. But it, is well
   known that the prepositions are often omitted in the Hebrew, and no
   doubt he means that they stirred up general enmity by their false
   information's being as the trumpet which sounds to battle. Some render
   the verb -- to conspire, or plot together, but this is a farfetched and
   meager sense. He intimates afterwards in what manner they stirred up
   unjust war by the wicked calumnies which they spread, as they could not
   crush a good and innocent person by violence, otherwise than by first
   overwhelming him with calumny.

   4. Keep me, O Jehovah! To complaints and accusations he now again adds
   prayer, from which it appears more clearly, as I observed already, that
   it is God whom he seeks to be his avenger. It is the same sentiment
   repeated, with one or two words changed; for he had said deliver me,
   now he says keep me, and for the wicked man he substitutes the hand of
   the wicked. He had spoken of their conceiving mischief's, now of their
   plotting how they might ruin a poor unsuspecting individual. What he
   had said of their fraud and deceit he repeats in figurative language,
   which does not want emphasis. He speaks of nets spread out on every
   side to circumvent him, unless God interposed for his help. Though at
   first sight the metaphors may seem more obscure than the prayer was in
   its simple unfigurative expression, they are far from darkening the
   previous declarations, and they add much to the strength of them. From
   the word g'ym, geim, which signifies proud or lofty in the Hebrew, we
   learn that he does not speak of common men, but of men in power, who
   considered that they would have no difficulty in crushing an
   insignificant individual. When our enemies attack us in the insolence
   of pride, let us learn to resort to God, who can repel the rage of the
   wicked. Nor does he mean to say that they attacked him merely by bold
   and violent measures, for he complains of their spreading gins and
   snares; both methods are spoken of, namely, that while they were
   confident of the power which they possessed, they devised stratagems
   for his destruction.

   [222] "The word man' in these two lines is expressed in the first by
   'dm (homo,) in the second by 'ys (vir.)" -- Jebb's Translation of the
   Psalms, etc., volume 1.

   [223] Mant translates -- "The serpent's brandished tongue is theirs."
   "The verb," says he, "here rendered brandished,' signifies either to
   whet, sharpen,' which is performed by reiterated motion or friction, or
   to vibrate.' In either case the metaphor, as applied to a wicked
   tongue, is beautiful and appropriate. I have preferred the latter as
   affording a more poetical image. See Parkhurst on snn, 3." In
   illustration of this figure Kimchi observes, that "the serpent when it
   comes to bite will open its mouth, and will hiss, and move its tongue
   here and there as if it would make it sharp as a barber's razor."

   [224] The original word ksvv, achshub, rendered "asp," is to be found
   in Scripture only in this place; and though it evidently denotes some
   of the serpent tribe, it is not so easy to determine the particular
   species intended. In our English Bible it is translated "adder," and as
   the word is derived from an Arabic verb, which signifies to coil up, or
   bend back, it has been said that this act perfectly corresponds with
   the nature of the adder, which in preparing to strike contracts itself
   into a spiral form, and raises its horrid head from the middle of the
   orb; and which also assumes the same form when it goes to sleep,
   coiling its body into a number of circles, with its head in the center.
   -- (Paxton's Illustrations of Scripture, vol. i. p. 428.) But the same
   action is common to most serpents; and this name may, therefore have
   reference to no particular species. Some, however, contend that it is
   another name for the pethem, or asp mentioned in Job 20:14, the venom
   of which is so deadly as to be incurable and followed by speedy death,
   unless the wounded part is amputated. Such seems to have been the
   opinion of the LXX., as they render it by aspis, in which they are
   followed by the Vulgate and by the Apostle Paul, who quotes this text
   in Romans 3:13. Calvin here adopts the word sanctioned by these
   authorities. "As to the poison, it will be observed, that in the
   venomous serpents there is a gland under the eye secreting the
   poisonous matter which is conveyed in a small tube or canal to the end
   of a fang which lies concealed at the roof of the mouth. This fang is
   moveable at the pleasure of the serpent, and is protruded when it is
   about to strike at an antagonist. The situation of this poison, which
   is in a manner behind the upper lip, gives great propriety to the
   expression -- Adders' poison is under their lips.' The usage of the
   Hebrew language, renders it by no means improbable that the fang itself
   is called lsvn, lashon, a tongue,' in the present text; and a serpent
   might be said to sharpen its tongue, when in preparing to strike it
   protruded its fangs. We do not see any explanation by which a more
   consistent meaning may be extracted from the expression here employed."
   -- Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible.

   [225] The imagery in this verse is borrowed from the practices of
   hunters and fowlers in the eastern regions of the world, who are
   accustomed to take and destroy the ferocious beasts and the larger
   species of birds by a variety of ingenious snares and devices. It is a
   curious circumstance, as noticed by Thevenot, that artifices of this
   kind are literally employed against men as well as against birds and
   wild beasts by some of the Orientals. "The cunningest robbers in the
   world," says he, as quoted by Mant, "are in this country. They use a
   certain slip, with a running noose, which they cast with so much slight
   about a man's neck when they are within reach of him, that they never
   fail, so that they strangle him in a trice."

   Psalm 140:6-10

   6. I said to Jehovah thou art my God; hear the voice of my
   supplication. 7. O, Jehovah, my Lord! the strength of my salvation,
   thou hast set a covering upon my head in the day of arms. [226] 8.
   Grant not, O Jehovah! the desires of the wicked; they have devised, do
   not though consummate, they shall be exalted. Selah. 9. As for the head
   of those compassing me about, let the mischief of his lips cover him.
   10. Let coals with fire fall upon them; he shall cast them into deeps,
   [227] they shall not rise again.


   6. I said to Jehovah. In these words he shows that his prayers were not
   merely those of the lips, as hypocrites will make loud appeals to God
   for mere appearance sake, but that he prayed with earnestness, and from
   a hidden principle of faith. Till we have a persuasion of being saved
   through the grace of God there can be no sincere prayer. We have here
   an excellent illustration of the nature of faith, in the Psalmist's
   turning himself away from man's view, that he may address God apart,
   hypocrisy being excluded in this internal exercise of the heart. This
   is true prayer -- not the mere idle lifting up of the voice, but the
   presentation of our petitions from an inward principle of faith. To
   beget in himself a persuasion of his obtaining his present requests
   from God, he recalls to his mind what deliverance's God had already
   extended to him. He speaks of his having been to him as a shield in
   every time of danger. Some read the words in the future tense -- "Thou
   wilt cover my head in the day of battle." But it is evident David
   speaks of protection formerly experienced from the hand of God, and
   from this derives comfort to his faith. He comes forth, not as a raw
   and undisciplined recruit, but as a soldier well tried in previous
   engagements. The strength of salvation is equivalent to salvation
   displayed with no ordinary power.

   8. Grant not, O Jehovah! the desires of the wicked [228] We might
   render the words Establish not, though the meaning would be the same --
   that God would restrain the desires of the wicked, and frustrate all
   their aims and attempts. We see from this that it is in his power,
   whenever he sees proper, to frustrate the unprincipled designs of men,
   and their wicked expectations, and to dash their schemes. When,
   therefore, it is found impracticable to bring our enemies to a right
   state of mind, we are to pray that the devices which they have imagined
   may be immediately overthrown and thwarted. In the next clause there is
   more ambiguity. As the Hebrew verb phvq, puk, means to lead out, as
   well as to strike or fall, the words might mean, that God would not
   carry out into effect the counsels of the wicked. But the opinion of
   those may be correct who read -- their thought is thou wilt not strike,
   David representing such hopes as the wicked are wont to entertain. We
   find him elsewhere (Psalm 10:6) describing their pride in a similar
   way, in entirely overlooking a divine providence, and considering all
   events as subject to their control, and the world placed under their
   sole management. The word which follows with thus come in appropriately
   -- they shall be lifted up, in illusion to the wicked being inflated by
   pride, through the idea that they can never be overtaken by adversity.
   If the other reading be preferred, the negative particle must be
   considered as repeated -- "Suffer not their attempts to be carried into
   effect; let them not be exalted." At any rate David is to be considered
   as censuring the security of his enemies, in making no account of God,
   and in surrendering themselves to unbridled license.

   9. As for the head, etc. There may be a doubt whether, under the term
   head, he refers to the chief of the faction opposed to him; for we call
   suppose an inversion in the sentence, and a change of the plural to the
   singular number, bringing out this sense. [229] "Let the mischief of
   their wicked speeches, which they intended against me, fall upon their
   own head." [230] As almost all interpreters, however, have taken the
   other view, I have adopted it, only understanding the reference as
   being to Saul rather than Doeg. There follows an imprecation upon the
   whole company of his enemies generally, that coals may fall upon them,
   alluding to the awful fate of Sodom and Gomorrha. We find this
   elsewhere (Psalm 11:6) set forth by the Spirit of God as an example of
   Divine vengeance, to terrify the wicked; and Jude (Jude 1:7) declares
   that God testified, by this example of everlasting significance, that
   he would be the Judge of all the ungodly. Some translate what follows
   -- the wilt cast them into the fire, which might pass. But as: v, beth,
   in the Hebrew often denotes instrumentality, we may properly render the
   words -- thou wilt cast them down By fire, or With fire, as God sent it
   forth against Sodom and Gomorrha. He prays they may be sunk into deep
   pits, whence they may never rise. God sometimes heals those whom he has
   smitten with great severity; David cuts off the reprobate from the hope
   of pardon, as knowing them to be beyond recovery. Had they been
   disposable to repentance, he would have been inclinable on his part to
   mercy.

   noisy collision of arms.

   [227] In the French version it is, as in our English Bible -- "Fosses

   properly means breaches or disruptions of the earth, such as are made
   by an earthquake. He conceives that the Psalmist alludes to the
   punishment of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, and of the two hundred and
   fifty men who burnt incense. (Numbers 16:31-35.) See Parkhurst on hmr.

   Psalm 140:11-13

   11. The man (vir) of tongue shall not be established in the earth, evil
   shall hunt the man (vir) [231] of violence to banishments. 12. I have
   known that God will accomplish the judgment of the poor, the judgment
   of the afflicted. 13. Surely the righteous will praise thy name, the
   upright shall dwell before thy face.


   11. The man of tongue, [232] etc. Some understand by this the
   loquacious man, but the sense is too restricted; nor is the reference
   to a reproachful, garrulous, vain and boastful man, but the man of
   virulence, who wars by deceit and calumny, and not openly. This is
   plain from what is said of the other class of persons in the subsequent
   part of the sentence, that his enemies were given to open violence as
   well as to treachery and cunning -- like the lion as well as the wolf
   -- as formerly he complained that the poison of the asp or viper was
   under their lips. The words run in the future tense, and many
   interpreters construe them into the optative form, or into a prayer;
   but I prefer retaining the future tense, as David does not appear so
   much to pray, as to look forward to a coming deliverance. Whether his
   enemies wrought by treachery, or by open violence, he looks forward to
   God as his deliverer. The figure drawn from hunting is expressive. The
   hunter, by spreading his toils on all sides, leaves no way of escape
   for the wild beast; and the ungodly cannot by any subterfuge elude the
   divine judgments. Mischief hunts them into banishment's, for the more
   they look for impunity and escape, they only precipitate themselves
   more certainly upon destruction.

   12. I have known; that God, etc. There can be no question that David
   here seals or corroborates his prayer by turning his thoughts and
   discourse to the providential judgments of God, for, as I have already
   said, doubtful prayer is no prayer at all. He declares it to be a thing
   known and ascertained that God cannot but deliver the afflicted. As he
   may connive for a time, however, and suffer good and upright persons to
   be grievously tried, David suggests as consideration which may meet
   this temptation, that God does so advisedly, that he may relieve those
   who are in affliction, and recover those who are oppressed. He
   accordingly says in express words that he will be the judge of the poor
   and the afflicted. In this way does he encourage both others and
   himself under continued troubles, till the time proper for deliverance
   arrive, intimating that though he might be universally considered an
   object of pity in being exposed to the fury of the wicked, and in not
   being immediately delivered by the hand of God, he would not give way
   to despair, but remember that it was the very part of God to undertake
   the cause of the poor. It were to weaken the passage if we considered
   David merely to be speaking of his own individual case.

   He infers (Psalm 140:13) that the righteous would give thanks to God,
   and be safe under his help. For the particle 'k, ach, which is often
   adversative in the Hebrew, is here affirmative, and denotes inference
   or consequence from what was formerly stated. Though the godly may be
   silenced for a time, and through the force of trouble may not raise the
   praises of God, David expresses his conviction that what was taken away
   would be speedily restored, and they would celebrate the loving
   kindness of the Lord with joy and alacrity. As this is not easily
   believed in circumstances of trial, the already referred to is
   inserted. We must endeavor, though with a struggle, to rise to a
   confident persuasion, that however low they may be brought, the Lord's
   people will be restored to prosperity, and will soon sing his praises.
   The second clause of the verse gives the reason of their
   thanksgiving's. He speaks of this as being the ground of the praises of
   the righteous, that they experience God's care of them, and concern for
   their salvation. For to dwell before God's face is to be cherished and
   sustained by his fatherly regards.

   [231] 'ys is the word for man in both these clauses.

   [232] "A man, of tongue, i.e., of evil tongue; a slanderer or
   detractor." -- Phillips. The Bible translation renders the phrase "an
   evil speaker;" and the Chaldee Paraphrase has "the man of detraction,
   with a three-forked tongue;" because such a man wounds three at once --
   the receiver, the sufferer, and himself.

   PSALM 141

   Whatever may have been the immediate cause pressing David to pray in
   the manner he does in this Psalm, [233] it is plain that his desire is
   through divine grace to check and bridle his spirit, under injuries of
   a causeless and unprovoked description, so as not to break out into
   retaliation and revenge, and return evil for evil. Having attained to
   the exercise of forbearance, he seeks that God would judge between him
   and his enemies.

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 141:1-4

   1. O Jehovah! I have cried unto thee, make haste unto me; give ear unto
   my voice when I cry unto thee. 2. Let my prayer be directed as incense
   before thy face; the lifting up of my hands, as [234] the evening
   sacrifice. 3. Set a watch, O Jehovah! upon my mouth, keep a guard upon
   the door of my lips. 4. Incline not my heart to an evil thing, to
   practice wicked works with men that work iniquity, and that I may not
   eat of their dainties.


   1. O Jehovah! I have cried unto thee. From such an exordium and manner
   of praying, it is evident that David was laboring under no small trial,
   as he repeats his requests, and insists upon receiving help. Without
   venturing to say anything definite upon the point, we would not
   disapprove of the conjecture that this Psalm was written by David with
   reference to the persecutions he suffered from Saul. He teaches us by
   his example to make application immediately to God, and not be tempted,
   as wicked men are, to renounce prayer, and rely on other resources. He
   says that he cried to God, not to heaven or earth, to men or to
   fortune, and other vain objects, which are made mention of, in the
   first place at least, in such cases by the ungodly. If they do address
   themselves to God, it is with murmurs and complaints, howling rather
   than praying.

   In the second verse the allusion is evidently to the legal ceremonies.
   [235] At that time the prayers of God's people were according to his
   own appointment sanctified through the offering up of incense and
   sacrifices, and David depended upon this promise. [236] As to the
   conjecture some have made, that he was at this time an exile, and cut
   off from the privileges of the religious assembly, nothing certain can
   be said upon that point; their idea being that there is a tacit
   antithesis in the verse -- that though prevented from continuing with
   God's worshippers into the sanctuary, or using incense and sacrifice,
   he desired God would accept his prayers notwithstanding. But as there
   seems no reason to adopt this restricted sense, it is enough to
   understand the general truth, that as these symbols taught the Lord's
   people to consider their prayers equally acceptable to God with the
   sweetest incense, and most excellent sacrifice, David derived
   confirmation to his faith from the circumstance. Although the view of
   the fathers was not confined entirely to the external ceremonies, David
   was bound to avail himself of such helps. As he considered, therefore,
   that it was not in vain the incense was burned daily on the altar by
   God's commandment, and the evening offering presented, he speaks of his
   prayers in connection with this ceremonial worship. The lifting up of
   the hands, evidently means prayer, for those who translate ms't,
   masath, a gift, obscure and pervert the meaning of the Psalmist. As the
   word, which is derived from ns', nasa, means lifting up in the Hebrew,
   the natural inference is, that prayer is meant, in allusion to the
   outward action practiced in it. And we can easily suppose that David
   here as elsewhere repeats the same thing twice. As to the reason which
   has led to the universal practice amongst all nations of lifting up the
   hand in prayer, I have taken notice of it elsewhere.

   3. Set a watch, O Jehovah! upon my mouth. As David was liable to be
   hurt at the unbridled and unprincipled rage of his enemies, so as to be
   tempted to act in a manner that might not be justifiable, he prays for
   divine direction, and not that he might be kept back from manual
   violence merely, but that his tongue might be restrained from venting
   reproach, or words of complaint. Even persons of the most
   self-possessed temper, if unwarrantably injured, will some -- times
   proceed to make retaliation, through their resenting the unbecoming
   conduct of their enemies. David prays accordingly that his tongue might
   be restrained by the Lord from uttering any word which was out of
   joint. Next he seeks that his heart be kept back from every mischievous
   device that might issue in revenge. The words added -- that I may not
   eat of their delicacies, are to be understood figuratively, as a
   petition that he might not be tempted by the prosperity which they
   enjoyed in sin to imitate their conduct. The three things mentioned in
   the context are to be connected; and it may be advisable to consider
   each of them more particularly. Nothing being more difficult than for
   the victims of unjust persecution to bridle their speech, and submit
   silently and without complaint to injuries, David needed to pray that
   his mouth might be closed and guarded -- that the door of his mouth
   might be kept shut by God, as one who keeps the gate watches the
   ingress and egress -- ntsrh, nitsrah, being the imperative of the verb,
   rather than a noun. He next subjoins that God would not incline his
   heart to an evil thing; for dvr, dabar, is here, as in many other
   places, used to signify a thing. Immediately after he explains himself
   to mean, that he would not desire to strive with them in wickedness,
   and thus make himself like his enemies. Had that monk of whom Eusebius
   makes mention duly reflected upon this resolution of David, he would
   not have fallen into the silly fallacy of imagining that he had shown
   himself the perfect scholar by observing silence for a whole term of
   seven years. Hearing that the regulation of the tongue was a rare
   virtue, he betook himself to a distant solitude, from which he did not
   return to his master for seven years; and being asked the cause of his
   long absence, replied that he had been meditating upon what he had
   learned from this verse. It would have been proper to have asked him at
   the same time, whether during the interim he had thought none, as well
   as spoken none. For the two things stand connected the being silent,
   and the being free from the charge of evil thoughts. It is very
   possible that although he observed silence, he had many ungodly
   thoughts, and these are worse than vain words. We have simply alluded
   in passing to this foolish notion, as what may convince the reader of
   the possibility of persons running away with a word torn from its
   connection, and overlooking the scope of the writer. In committing
   himself to the guidance of God, both as to thoughts and words, David
   acknowledges the need of the influence of the Spirit for the regulation
   of his tongue and of his mind, particularly when tempted to be
   exasperated by the insolence of opposition. If, on the one hand, the
   tongue be liable to slip and too fast of utterance, unless continually
   watched and guarded by God; on the other, there are disorderly
   affections of an inward kind which require to be restrained. What a
   busy workshop is the heart of man, and what a host of devices is there
   manufactured every moment! If God do not watch over our heart and
   tongue, there will confessedly be no bounds to words and thoughts of a
   sinful kind, -- so rare a gift of the Spirit is moderation in language,
   while Satan is ever making suggestions which will be readily and easily
   complied with, unless God prevent. It need not seem absurd to speak of
   God inclining our hearts to evil, since these are in his hand, to turn
   them whithersoever he willeth at his pleasure. Not that he himself
   prompts them to evil desires, but as according to his secret judgments
   he surrenders and effectually gives over the wicked to Satan's tyranny,
   he is properly said to blind and harden them. The blame of their sins
   rests with men themselves, and the lust which is in them; and, as they
   are carried out to good or evil by a natural desire, it is not from any
   external impulse that they incline to what is evil, but spontaneously
   and of their own corruption. I have read -- to work the works of
   iniquity; others read -- to think the thoughts of iniquity. The meaning
   is the same, and it is needless to insist upon the preference to be
   given. By mnmym, manammim, translated delicacies, is meant the
   satisfaction felt by the ungodly when their sins are connived at
   through the divine forbearance. While their insolence in such a case
   becomes more presumptuous, even the Lord's people are in danger of
   being deceived by the prosperity they see enjoying, and to take
   liberties themselves. David had reason therefore to pray for the secret
   restraints of the Holy Spirit, that he might be kept from feasting on
   their delicacies; that is, being intoxicated into license or sinful
   pleasure through anything debasing, flattering, or agreeable in outward
   circumstances. [237]
     __________________________________________________________________

   [234] As, here and in the preceding clause, is a supplement, very
   properly made by our author; a word signifying like, or in the stead
   of, being frequently understood in the Hebrew text of the Psalms.

   [235] The allusion, according to the opinion of most commentators, is
   to the morning and evening sacrifices, of which see an account in
   Exodus 29:38-42. In the phraseology of the verse it is supposed that
   there is a reference to the commencing and concluding acts of the daily
   public worship among the Jews. Every morning and evening the priests
   offered incense upon the incense-altar which stood in the holy place,
   while the people prayed without. But in the morning the incense was
   offered before the sacrifice was laid upon the altar of burnt-offering;
   whereas in the evening (at the ninth hour) it was offered after the
   sacrifice was laid upon the altar; and thus in the evening the
   sacrifice and the incense were offered at the same time. See
   Lightfoot's Temple Service, chapter 9: section 5. Dr. Adam Clarke,
   however, thinks that David does not refer to any sacrifice; "for," says
   he, "he uses not zvch, zebach, which is almost universally used for a
   slaughtered animal, mncht, minchath, which is generally taken for a
   gratitude offering, or an unbloody sacrifice." He translates the last
   two words "the evening oblation."

   fussent sanctifiees par encensement et par sacrifices, David s'appuye
   sur ceste promesse." -- Fr.

   se desbordant a mal, et qu'ainsi il ne s'esgaye en pechez." -- Fr.

   Psalm 141:5-7

   5. Let the righteous smite me, a kindness; and let him chastise me, a
   precious oil, it shall not break my head: for yet my prayer also shall
   be in their calamities. 6. Their judges have been thrown down upon
   stony places; and they shall hear my words, for they are sweet. 7. As
   one who breaketh and cutteth [238] on the earth, our bones have been,
   scattered at the mouth of the grave.


   5. Let the righteous smite me, etc. While Satan tempts the wicked by
   his allurements, they, at the same time, deceive one another by
   flattery, which leads David to declare, that he would much rather be
   awakened to his duty by the severe rod of reproof, than be seduced
   through pleasing falsehoods. Among those who hold religion in contempt
   no reproof is administered to one who has contracted any sin, and,
   therefore, if we have any concern for our spiritual safety we will
   connect ourselves with good men, who restore such as have fallen by
   upright admonition, and bring back those who have erred to the right
   way. It is not agreeable to corrupt nature to be reproved when we sin,
   but, David had brought himself to that degree of docility and
   self-denial which led him to consider no reproof distasteful which he
   knew to proceed from the spirit of kindness. As there is some ambiguity
   in the words, we may see to ascertain the proper meaning of them. The
   noun chsd, chesed, can very well be resolved into the adverb -- the
   righteous shall smite me mercifully, or in mercy, supplying the
   preposition. And this is the meaning adopted by most interpreters, that
   David reckoned as the best ointment such reproofs as breathed charity
   and kindness, or proceeded from a kind and dispassionate spirit. Should
   this reading be preferred it is to be remembered, that David refers,
   not so much to the outward manner in which the reproof is to be
   administered, as to the frame of the heart. However how good men may
   be, and whatever severity of language they may employ in admonishing
   those who have erred, they are still actuated by the force of brotherly
   affection. My, the very severity is, in fact, occasioned by their holy
   anxiety and fear of their brother's safety. The righteous act
   mercifully under all this apparent sharpness and severity -- as the
   wicked, on the other hand, act cruelly who censure only in a very
   gentle manner. By noticing this feature in reproof, David besides would
   distinguish that kind of it which takes its rise in sincere affection,
   from invectives which proceed from hatred or private animosity, as
   Solomon says. (Proverbs 10:12.) The other rendering of the words,
   however, which I have adopted, is equally suitable --

   Let the righteous censure me, it shall be mercy, or, I will reckon it a
   benefit, let him reprove me, this shall be precious ointment that will
   not hurt my head.

   The last clause some interpret in another way -- the oil of the head
   let it not break my head, that is, let not the wicked seduce me to
   destruction by their pleasing flatteries. [239] By the oil they
   understand the pernicious adulations by which the wicked would ruin us,
   and plunge us deeper and deeper in destruction, while they seem to
   administer pleasure. This would make the passage convey a fuller
   meaning, That while David was pliable and yielding in the matter of
   reproof, he fled from flattery as from the fatal songs of the Sirens.
   However sweet praise may be to the taste at first, every one who lends
   an ear to flattery, drinks in a poison which will presently diffuse
   itself through the whole heart. Let us learn by David's example to
   reject all flatteries, prone as we are naturally to receive them, and
   to renounce waywardness and obstinacy, lest we should put away from us
   those corrections which are wholesome remedies for our vices. For such
   is the infatuated love men have to their own destruction, that even
   when forced to condemn themselves they wish to have the approbation of
   the world. And why? that by superinducing torpor of conscience, they
   may, by their own spontaneous act, devote themselves to ruin.

   For yet my prayer, etc. Three explanations of this clause have been
   suggested. According to some the meaning of it is, that, as we are ever
   ready to be corrupted by bad example, David here prays, that he might
   not decline to their evils, or the evils which they practiced. The
   second sense assigned is, that David, recognizing their mischievous
   devices, prays that he may be kept by the Lord from their wickedness.
   The third sense, that recognizing them as reduced to desperate
   calamities, he prays that the just vengeance of God might be executed
   upon them according to their deserts. The very opposite meaning might
   seem the more suitable, that David was not prevented by their obstinacy
   in wickedness from praying for their welfare. For there is the adverb
   yet emphatically inserted. Or, what if David is to be considered as
   predicting their unfortunate end, intimating, that though the ungodly
   now riot in excess, they shall shortly be arrested, and that before
   long his compassion would be exercised towards them? The way in which
   the words stand connected favors this view; for he does not say -- yet
   my prayer shall be in their calamities, but rather separately, "yet,
   or, yet a little while, and then my power shall be in their
   calamities." As David was in danger of being tempted to yield to
   similarly vain courses with them, he very properly suggests a
   sustaining motive to his soul, why he should retain his integrity, that
   erelong they would be overtaken with so awful a destruction as to
   entreat compassion from him and others of the people of God.

   6. Their judges have been thrown down upon stony places [240] Almost
   all interpreters agree, that the tense of the verb should be changed
   from the preterit to the future, and then resolve it into the optative
   -- let them be thrown down. It appears to me that the sense of David
   would be made very plain by reading, When their judges have been cast
   down from the rock, or upon stony places, they shall hear my words.
   David, on perceiving the rage which the common people expressed towards
   him, as carried away through the influence of error and
   misrepresentation, lays the blame upon their leaders. When their power
   should be taken away, he is confident that the simple, who had been
   misled, would be brought to a right mind. Casting from the rocks, or
   upon stony places, is a metaphorical expression in reference to the
   high and dignified position in which they were placed. Although not
   without blame in following evil counselors so as to persecute unjustly
   a good and godly man, yet he had reason to entertain more hope of their
   repentance, that they would return to consideration when God executed
   vengeance upon those who were at their head. We see how ready the
   common people are to judge by impulse rather than deliberation, and to
   be hurried into most condemnable proceedings by blind prejudice, while
   afterwards upon being admonished they retrace their steps with equal
   precipitation. So that, granting cruelty must always be sinful, and
   simplicity no excuse, we are taught by David's example to pray that
   sound counsel may be sent to such as are in error, with a view to
   enabling them to hear the truth and the right with patience.

   7. As one who breaketh, etc. Here David complains that his enemies were
   not satisfied with inflicting upon him one death -- death of a common
   description -- but must first mangle him, and those associated with
   him, and then cast them into the grave. The common robber on the
   highway throws the body of his murdered victim whole into the ditch;
   David tells us, that he and those with him were treated more
   barbarously, their Bones being dispersed, as one cleaves wood or stones
   into fragments, or digs the earth. From this it appears, that David,
   like Paul, (2 Corinthians 1:9,) was delivered from deaths oft; [241]
   and we may learn the duty of continuing to cherish hope of life and
   deliverance even when the expression may apply to us, that our bones
   have been broken and scattered.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [238] "As one cutting and slitting. Many persons understand tsym, wood,
   after these participles, supposing the comparison of scattering the
   bones to be made with the scattering of wood after it has been cleft.
   But it is more probable that what the Psalmist intended to say was in
   substance as follows: Our bones lie scattered at the edge of the grave,
   just as one cutting and cleaving the earth in making a grave often
   throws up bones, which may be seen scattered here and there with the
   earth lying at its sides.' The verse is poetical, and the figure
   indicates great distress." -- Phillips

   [239] "Que l'huile de la teste ne rompe point ma teste, c'est a dire,
   que les meschans ne m'amadouent point par leurs flatteries a ma
   perdition et ruine." -- Fr.

   [240] Those who understand this verse as containing an allusion to the
   generous manner in which David acted towards Saul in the cave of
   En-gedi, and to his mild expostulation after they had both left the
   cave, translate thus: -- "Their princes on the sides of the rock were
   dismissed,
   or let go in safety; And they heard my words that they were pleasant."
   This exactly corresponds with the occurrences referred to. In
   correspondence with the first line, it, is said in 1 Samuel 24:2, that
   Saul and his chosen men went to seek David upon the rocks of the wild
   goats; and the terms in which David expostulated with Saul, were so
   gentle, dutiful and affecting, as for the time to melt into tenderness
   and contrition the heart of Saul, and to impress the minds of all who
   heard them.

   [241] If David here refers to the treatment he and his followers met
   with at the hands of Saul, this exhibits in dark colors the extreme
   inhumanity of that monarch. "We are not sufficiently informed," says
   Walford, "respecting the cruelties which were perpetrated against David
   and those who adhered to him, to enable us to point out the instances
   to which he here alludes; but the murder of Abimelech, and of the
   priests who were with him, furnishes a pregnant proof of the atrocities
   which Saul and his agents were capable of perpetrating. (See 1 Samuel
   22.) It appears from the language of this verse that such enormities
   were not confined to a few cases, but must have been numerous, to give
   occasion to the image which is employed to describe them." How striking
   the contrast between David's treatment of Saul, and that which Saul
   adopted towards him! Mr. Peters in his Dissertations on Job, gives an
   exposition of this 7th verse which is ingenious, and which Archbishop
   Secker calls "admirable, though not quite unexceptionable."
   Understanding the verse as referring to the slaughter of the priests at
   Nob, just now adverted to, he renders the words s'vl lphy, (which
   Calvin translates, at the grave's mouth,) at the mouth, that is, at the
   command of Saul. In support of this translation he produces similar
   expressions, l phy phrh, at the command of Pharaoh, (Genesis 45:21,)
   and l phyk, at thy command. (Job 39:17.) To this rendering there is,
   however, this strong objection, that we do not find David ever
   mentioning Saul by name in any of the Psalms. Peters, indeed, states
   that this objection was offered to him against his view, and he
   endeavors to remove it, though, as we think, with indifferent success.

   Psalm 141:8-10

   8. Because to thee, O Jehovah! My Lord, are my eyes; in thee have I
   hoped: leave mot my soul destitute. 9. Keep we from the hands of the
   snare which they have spread for me, from the nets of the workers of
   iniquity. 10. Let the wicked fall together into his nets; I always
   shall pass by. [242]


   8. Because to thee, O Jehovah! etc. If we reflect upon what was
   comprehended under the previous figure of their bones being broken, his
   praying in such circumstances is just as if the torn fragments of a
   mangled corpse should cry unto God. This may give us some idea of the
   heroical courage of David, who could continue to direct his eyes to God
   even under such overwhelming difficulties; this being the very part
   faith ought to discharge, in making us collected and composed when our
   senses would otherwise be confounded. [243] Great a miracle as it would
   have been for God to have preserved them in life, when their bones were
   scattered abroad, it was a double miracle to support their minds in the
   firm persuasion of their not perishing.

   9. Keep me, etc. He owns himself to be shut up in the snares of his
   enemies, unless set free by a higher hand. In praying to God under the
   straits to which he was reduced, he proves what a high estimate he
   formed of what his mercy could effect, as elsewhere he says, that the
   issues from death belong to him. (Psalm 68:20.) God often delays
   interposing, that the deliverance may be the more signal; and
   afterwards he makes the devices of the wicked to recoil upon their own
   heads. It seems absurd to refer the pronoun his to Saul, as if the
   sense were that Doeg and others of that character would fall into the
   snares of Saul. It would seem to be God who is intended. First, he had
   spoken of being preserved by God from the toils of the wicked, and now
   to these snares which the wicked spread for the upright he opposes the
   snares with which God catches the crafty in their own devices. And as
   the number of his enemies was great, he uses the expression, let them
   fall together, for escape would have been impossible, had he not been
   persuaded that it was easy for God to overthrow any combined force and
   array of men. What follows admits of two meanings. Many read, I shall
   always pass. But we may suppose order of the words changed and read,
   until I pass. It prays that his enemies should be held in the snare
   till he got off safe,

   [233] Many commentators are strongly of opinion, that this Psalm was
   written as a memorial of that very interesting scene in the life of
   David, recorded in 1 Samuel 24, relating to his generous treatment of
   Saul. Though he had an opportunity of putting that his cruel persecutor
   to death in the cave of En-gedi, yet he spared his life, only cutting
   off his skirt, and not suffering his followers to touch him; and when
   Saul had gone out of the cave, David going out after him, remonstrated
   with him from some distance in the gentlest and most respectful
   language in regard to the injustice of his conduct towards him. It is
   thought that the sixth verse contains so express a reference to this
   very remarkable occurrence in David's history, as to leave little doubt
   that it was the occasion on which the Psalm was composed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 142

   When Saul came into the cave where David lay concealed, this saint of
   God might upon such an occurrence have been either thrown into
   consternation, or led by his alarm into some unwarrantable step, it
   being common for persons in despair either to be prostrated with
   dismay, or driven into frenzy. But it appears from this Psalm that
   David retained his composure, relying with assured confidence upon God,
   and resigning himself to vows and prayers instead of taking any
   unauthorized steps.

   A Prayer of David, giving instruction when he was in the cave. [244]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 142:1-4

   1. I cried to Jehovah with my voice, with my voice to Jehovah I made
   supplication. 2. I pour out my meditation before his face: I tell my
   affliction before his face. 3. When my spirit was perplexed within me,
   and thou knewest my path: in the way wherein I walked they laid a snare
   for me. 4. On looking to the right hand, and perceiving, none would
   know me, refuge failed me, there was none seeking after my soul.


   1. I cried [245] to Jehovah, etc. It showed singular presence of mind
   in David that he was not paralyzed with fear, or that he did not in a
   paroxysm of fury take vengeance upon his enemy, as he easily might have
   done; and that he was not actuated by despair to take away his life,
   but composedly addressed himself to the exercise of prayer. There was
   good reason why the title should have been affixed to the Psalm to note
   this circumstance, and David had good grounds for mentioning how he
   commended himself to God. Surrounded by the army of Saul, and hemmed in
   by destruction on every side, how was it possible for him to have
   spared so implacable an enemy, had he not been fortified against the
   strongest temptations by prayer? The repetition he makes use of
   indicates his having prayed with earnestness, so as to be impervious to
   every assault of temptation.

   He tells us still more clearly in the next verse that he disburdened
   his ears unto God. To pour out one's thoughts and tell over his
   afflictions implies the reverse of those perplexing anxieties which men
   brood over inwardly to their own distress, and by which they torture
   themselves, and are chafed by their afflictions rather than led to God;
   or it implies the reverse of those frantic exclamations to which others
   give utterance who find no comfort in the superintending providence and
   care of God. In short, we are left to infer that while he did not give
   way before men to loud and senseless lamentations, neither did he
   suffer himself to be tormented with inward and suppressed cares, but
   made known his grief's with unsuspecting confidence to the Lord.

   3. When, my spirit, etc. Though he owns here that he felt anxiety, yet
   he confirms what he had said as to the constancy of his faith. The
   figure which he uses of his spirit being perplexed, [246] aptly
   represents the state of the mind in alternating between various
   resolutions when there was no apparent outgate from danger, and
   increasing its distress by resorting to all kinds of devices. He adds,
   that though there was no apparent way of safety, God knew from the
   beginning in what way his deliverance should be effected. Others put a
   different meaning upon this clause, thou knowest my way, as if David
   asserted God to have been witness of his integrity, but the other is
   the more correct, that God knew the way to deliver him, while his own
   mind was distracted by a variety of thoughts, and yet could not
   conceive any mode of extrication. The words teach us, when we have
   tried every remedy and know not what to do, to rest satisfied with the
   conviction that God is acquainted with our afflictions, and condescends
   to care for us, as Abraham said --

   "The Lord will provide." (Genesis 22:8.)

   4. On looking to the right hand, [247] etc., He shows that there was
   good cause for the dreadful sufferings he experienced, since no human
   aid or comfort was to be expected, and destruction seemed inevitable.
   When he speaks of having looked and yet not perceived a friend amongst
   men, he does not mean that he had turned his thoughts to earthly helps
   in forgetfulness of God, but that he had made such inquiry as was
   warrantable after one on the earth who might assist him. Had any person
   of the kind presented himself, he would no doubt have recognized him as
   an instrument in the hand of God's mercy, but it was God's purpose that
   he should be abandoned of all assistance from man, and that his
   deliverance from destruction should thus appear more extraordinary. In
   the expression, none seeking after my soul, the verb to seek after is
   used in a good sense, for being solicitous about any man's welfare or
   safety.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [245] In the Hebrew the verb is in the future -- "I will cry;" but as
   that language has no present tense, it frequently uses for it the past
   and future promiscuously. Bishop Horne, therefore, renders in the
   present all the verbs in this Psalm, which Calvin translates in the
   past, except the verbs in the two first verses, which he renders in the
   future. Translators, however, in general concur with Calvin, and we
   think justly, the Psalm, as we conceive, being a recollection of the
   substance of the prayers he addressed to God while in the cave of
   En-gedi, but which it cannot be supposed he had then an opportunity of
   committing to writing.

   [246] "Or c'est une belle similitude quand il dit que son esprit a este
   en tortille et enveloppe," etc. -- Fr.

   [247] The allusion here, it is supposed, is to the observances of the
   ancient Jewish courts of judicature, in which the advocate, as well as
   the accuser, stood on the right hand of the accused. (Psalm 109:5.) The
   Psalmist felt himself in the condition of one who had nobody to plead
   his cause, and to protect him in the dangerous circumstances in which
   he was placed.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 142:5-7

   5. I cried unto thee, O Jehovah! I said thou art my hope and my portion
   in the land of the living. 6. Attend unto my cry, for I labor very much
   under affliction: deliver me from my persecutors, for they are stronger
   than I. 7. Rescue my soul from prison, that I may praise thy name; the
   righteous shall crown me, for thou wilt recompense me.


   5. I cried unto thee, O Jehovah! With a view to hasten God's
   interposition, David complains of the low estate he was reduced to, and
   of his extremity; the term cry denoting vehemence, as I have elsewhere
   noticed. He speaks of deliverance as being plainly needed, since he was
   now held a prisoner. By prison some suppose he alludes to the cave
   where he was lodged, but this is too restricted a meaning. The
   subsequent clause, the righteous shall compass me, is translated
   differently by some, they shall wait me. I have retained the true and
   natural sense. I grant that it is taken figuratively for surrounding,
   intimating that he would be a spectacle to all, the eyes of men being
   attracted by such a singular case of deliverance. If any consider the
   words not to be figurative, the sense will be, That the righteous would
   not only congratulate him, but place a crown upon his head in token of
   victory. Some explain the passage, They will assemble to congratulate
   me, and will stand round me on every side like a crown. As the words
   literally read, they will crown upon me, some supply another pronoun,
   and give this sense, that the righteous would construe the mercy
   bestowed upon David as a glory conferred upon themselves; for when God
   delivers any of his children he holds out the prospect of deliverance
   to the rest, and, as it were, gifts them with a crown. The sense which
   I have adopted is the simplest, however, That the mercy vouchsafed
   would be shown conspicuously to all as in a theater, proving a signal
   example to the righteous for establishment of their faith. The verb
   gml, gamal, in the Hebrew, is of a more general signification than to
   repay, and means to confer a benefit, as I have shown elsewhere.

   [244] In the history of David we read particularly of the two caves in
   which he took shelter, that of Adullam, (1 Samuel 22:1,) and that of
   En-gedi, (1 Samuel 24:3.) The latter is generally supposed to be the
   cave here

   PSALM 143

   Although the enemies with whom David had to contend were wicked, and
   their persecution as unjust as it was cruel, David recognized the just
   judgment of God in it all, and seeks to conciliate his favor by humbly
   supplicating pardon. Having complained of the cruelty of his enemies,
   and declared that amidst all his affliction he still remembered God, he
   prays for restoration, and the guidance of God's Spirit, that the
   remainder of his life might be devoted to his fear.

   A Psalm of David. [248]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 143:1-3

   1. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah! give ear to my supplication, in thy truth
   answer me, in thy righteousness. 2. And enter not into judgment with
   thy servant, for in thy sight shall no man living be justified. 3. For
   the enemy hath persecuted my soul; he hath prostrated my life on the
   ground: he hath set me in dark places, as the dead of an age.


   1. Hear my prayer, O Jehovah! It is evident that the oppression of his
   enemies must have been extreme, when David laments his case in such
   earnest and pathetic terms. The introductory words show that the grief
   he felt was great. His reason for speaking of the justice and
   faithfulness of God in connection we have shown elsewhere. Under the
   term justice, or righteousness, we are not to suppose that he speaks of
   merit, or hire, as some ignorantly imagine, but of that goodness of God
   which leads him to defend his people. To the same effect does he speak
   of God's truth or faithfulness; for the best proof he can give of his
   faithfulness is in not forsaking those whom he has promised to help. In
   helping his people he shows himself to be a just and true God, both in
   not frustrating their expectation, and in so far as he shows in this
   extension of mercy what his nature is, that David very properly
   encourages himself in prayer by making mention of both.

   2. And enter not into judgment, [249] etc. I have hinted already why he
   proceeds to pray for pardon. When overtaken by adversity, we are ever
   to conclude that it is a rod of correction sent by God to stir us up to
   pray. Although he is far from taking pleasure in our trials, it is
   certain that our sins are the cause of his dealing towards us with this
   severity. While those to whom David was opposed were wicked men, and he
   was perfectly conscious of the rectitude of his cause as regarded them,
   he freely acknowledged his sin before God as a condemned suppliant. We
   are to hold this as a general rule in seeking to conciliate God, that
   we must pray for the pardon of our sins. If David found refuge nowhere
   else than in prayer for pardon, who is there amongst us who would
   presume to come before God trusting in his own righteousness and
   integrity? Nor does David here merely set an example before God's
   people how they ought to pray, but declares that there is none amongst
   men who could be just before God were he called to plead his cause. The
   passage is one fraught with much instruction, teaching us, as I have
   just hinted, that God can only show favor to us in our approaches by
   throwing aside the character of a judge, and reconciling us to himself
   in a gratuitous remission of our sins. All human righteousnesses,
   accordingly, go for nothing, when we come to his tribunal. This is a
   truth which is universally acknowledged in words, but which very few
   are seriously impressed with. As there is an indulgence which is
   mutually extended to one another amongst men, they all come confidently
   before God for judgment, as if it were as easy to satisfy him as to
   gain man's approval. In order to obtain a proper view of the whole
   matter, we are first to note what is meant by being justified. The
   passage before us clearly proves that the man who is justified, is he
   who is judged and reckoned just before God, or whom the heavenly Judge
   himself acquits as innocent. Now, in denying that any amongst men can
   claim this innocence, David intimates that any righteousness which the
   saints have is not perfect enough to abide God's scrutiny, and thus he
   declares that all are guilty before God, and can only be absolved in
   the way of acknowledging they might justly be condemned. Had perfection
   been a thing to be found in the world, he certainly of all others was
   the man who might justly have boasted of it; and the righteousness of
   Abraham and the holy fathers was not unknown to him; but he spares
   neither them nor himself, but lays it down as the one universal rule of
   conciliating God, that we must cast ourselves upon his mercy. This may
   give us some idea of the satanic infatuation which has taken hold of
   those who speak so much of perfection in holiness, with a view to
   supersede remission of sins. Such a degree of pride could never be
   evinced by them, were they not secretly influenced by a brutish
   contempt of God. They speak in high and magnificent terms of
   regeneration, as if the whole kingdom of Christ consisted in purity of
   life. But in doing away with the principal blessing of the everlasting
   covenant -- gratuitous reconciliation -- which God's people are
   commanded to seek daily, and in puffing up both themselves and others
   with a vain pride, they show what spirit they are of. Let us hold them
   in detestation, since they scruple not to put open contempt upon God.
   This of itself, however, which we have stated, is not enough; for the
   Papists themselves acknowledge that were God to enter upon an
   examination of men's lives as a judge, all would lie obnoxious to just
   condemnation. And in this respect they are sounder, more moderate and
   sober, than those Cyclopses and monsters in heresy of whom we have just
   spoken. But though not arrogating to themselves righteousness in the
   whole extent of it, they show, by obtruding their merits and
   satisfactions, that they are very far from following the example of
   David. They are always ready to acknowledge some defect in their works,
   and so, in seeking God's favor, they plead for the assistance of his
   mercy. But there is nothing intermediate between these two things,
   which are represented in Scripture as opposites -- being justified by
   faith and justified by works. It is absurd for the Papists to invent a
   third species of righteousness, which is partly wrought out by works of
   their own, and partly imputed to them by God in his mercy. Without all
   doubt, when he affirmed that no man could stand before God were his
   works brought to judgment, David had no idea of this complex or twofold
   righteousness, but would shut us up at once to the conclusion that God
   is only favorable upon the ground of his mercy, since any reputed
   righteousness of man has no significance before him.

   3. For the enemy hath persecuted my soul. Having acknowledged that he
   only suffered the just punishment of his sins, David comes now to speak
   of his enemies; for to have begun by speaking of them would have been a
   preposterous order. Their cruelty was shown in their not resting
   satisfied but with the destruction of one who was a saint of God; he
   declares that he must even now perish unless God should help him
   speedily. The comparison is not merely to a dead man, but a putrid
   corpse; for by the dead of an age [250] are meant those who have been
   long removed from the world. Such language intimates that he not only
   trusted in God as he who could heal him of a deadly disease, but
   considered that though his life should be buried, as it were, and long
   out of mind, God could raise it again, and restore his very ashes.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [249] Walford thinks there is probably here a reference to the great
   transgression, the consequences of which followed David all his days.
   "As he would not fail to be reminded of it," says that writer, "by the
   sorrows which had now come upon him, from Absalom's misconduct, and as
   his purpose was, notwithstanding, to implore divine support and
   deliverance, he deprecates God's righteous judgment, since if no man
   could be just with God, certainly he, who had so greatly transgressed,
   could have no claim to such a state. The consciousness of his guilt,
   though he had reason to believe it was forgiven, induced him thus to
   abase himself before God, when he was about to offer earnest entreaties
   for deliverance from dangers which threatened his dignity and life;
   while he still maintained his hope, that God looked upon him as his
   servant, whom he had pledged himself to protect."

   [250] kmty vlm. These words are differently rendered in the ancient
   versions. The Septuagint has hos nekrous aionos, as the dead of the
   age; the Syriac, forever; the Chaldee, as they that lie down of that
   age. The real sense of the expression is, as they who have been dead a
   long time. The Psalmist employs hyperbolical language in this verse; he
   says, the enemy hath beaten his life to the ground, hath made him dwell
   in dark places, and for such a length of time, that there remained no
   remembrance of him, and that he had become like those persons who had
   long since been in their graves. The design of all this is to express
   emphatically great sorrow and oppression." -- Phillips.

   Psalm 143:4-7

   4. And my spirit is perplexed within me, my heart within me is
   astonished. 5. I remembered the days of old, I meditated upon all thy
   works; I meditated upon the work of thy hands. 6. I spread out my hands
   to thee, my soul is to thee as the earth without water. [251] Selah. 7.
   Hasten, answer me, O Jehovah! my spirit faileth: hide not thy face from
   me, because I shall be like to those descending into the pit.


   4. And my spirit, etc. Hitherto he has spoken of the troubles that were
   without, now he acknowledges the feebleness of his spirits, from which
   it is evident that his strength, was not like that of the rock,
   imperturbable or without feeling, but that, while overwhelmed with
   grief as to the feeling of the flesh, he owed his support entirely to
   faith and the grace of the Spirit. We are taught by his example not to
   throw up the conflict in despair, however much we may be weakened, and
   even exanimated by afflictions, as God will enable us to surmount them,
   if we only rise to him with our hearts amidst all our anxieties.

   In the next verse David mentions that he had diligently sought means
   whereby to mitigate his grief. It is not to be wondered at, that many
   who spontaneously give themselves up to inaction, should sink under
   their trials, not using means to invigorate themselves by calling to
   remembrance the grace of God. Sometimes, it is true, our trials are
   only more keenly felt when we recall the former kindness which God may
   have shown to us, the comparison tending to awaken our feelings, and
   render them more acute; but David proposed a different end than this to
   himself, and gathered confidence from the past mercies of God. The very
   best method in order to obtain relief in trouble, when we are about to
   faint under it, is to call to mind the former loving-kindness of the
   Lord. Nor does David mean such as he had experienced from childhood, as
   some have thought, adopting in my judgment too restricted a sense; for
   the word qdm, kedem, has a more extensive signification. I have no
   doubt, therefore, that he includes past history, as well as his own
   personal experience, it being easy to discover proofs there of God's
   continued goodness to his people. We should ourselves learn by his
   example, in reflecting upon personal favors received from God, to
   remember also how often he has assisted those that served him, and
   improve the truth for our own benefit. Should this not immediately or
   at once abate the bitterness of our grief, yet the advantage of it will
   afterwards appear. In the passage before us, David complains that he
   did not get relief from his anxieties and cares from this consolatory
   source, but he prosecuted his meditations in expectation of finding the
   good result in due time. The verb svh, suach, I have elsewhere
   observed, may mean either to declare with the tongue, or to revolve in
   the mind. Some accordingly read -- "I have discoursed of thy works."
   But as the verb hgh, hagah, means to meditate, I consider that the
   Psalmist repeats the same thing twice, and this in token of
   earnestness. We will often upon a slight exercise of the thoughts upon
   God's works, start aside from them almost immediately; nor is it matter
   of surprise, that, in this case, there results no solid comfort. That
   our knowledge may be abiding we must call in the aid of constant
   attention.

   6. I have stretched forth my hands to thee. Here appears the good
   effect of meditation, that it stirred David up to pray; for if we
   reflect seriously upon the acting's of God towards his people, and
   towards ourselves in our own experience, this will necessarily lead out
   our minds to seek after him, under the alluring influence of his
   goodness. Prayer, indeed, springs from faith; but as practical proofs
   of the favor and mercy confirm this faith, they are means evidently
   fitted for dissipating languor. He makes use of a striking figure to
   set forth the ardor of his affection, comparing his soul to the parched
   earth. In great heats we see that the earth is cleft, and opens, as it
   were, its mouth to heaven for moisture. David therefore intimates, he
   drew near to God with vehement desire, as if the very sap of life
   failed him, as he shows more fully in the verse which follows. In this
   he gives another proof of his extraordinary faith. Feeling himself
   weak, and ready to sink into the very grave, he does not vacillate
   between this and the other hope of relief, but fixes his sole
   dependence upon God. And heavy as the struggle was that he underwent
   with his own felt weakness, the fainting of spirit he speaks of was a
   better stimulant to prayer than any stoical obstinacy he might have
   shown in suppressing fear, grief, or anxiety. We must not overlook the
   fact, how in order to induce himself to depend exclusively upon God, he
   dismisses all other hopes from his mind, and makes a chariot to himself
   of the extreme necessity of his case, in which he ascends upwards to
   God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [251] In the Book of Common Prayer it is -- "My soul gaspeth unto thee
   as a thirsty land." Mant translates similarly. The word gaspeth is a
   supplement, but it may convey the precise meaning; and according to
   this view the allusion is to the cracking of the lands of the east, in
   consequence of the extreme drought of the summer months. These dry
   lands, as has been noticed by travelers, have often chinks too deep for
   a person to see to the bottom of. This may be observed in the Indies
   more than anywhere, a little before the autumnal rains fall, and,
   wherever the lands are rich and hard. See Jeremiah 14:4.

   Psalm 143:8-12

   8. Cause me to hear thy loving-kindness in the morning, for in thee
   have I hoped; show me the way in which I may walk, for I have lifted up
   my soul to thee. 9. Deliver me, O Jehovah! from my enemies; I have
   hidden with thee. 10. Teach me that I may do thy will, for thou art my
   God; let thy good Spirit lead me into the right land. 11. For thy
   name's sake, O Lord! thou wilt quicken me: in thy righteousness bring
   my soul out of trouble. 12. And in thy mercy thou wilt scatter my
   enemies, and thou wilt destroy [252] all them that afflict my soul, for
   I am thy servant.


   8. Cause me to hear thy loving-kindness. In this verse he again prays
   that God would show him his favor visibly and effectually. The
   expression cause me to hear, may seem not very proper, as the goodness
   of God is rather felt than heard; but as the mere perception of God's
   benefits, without a believing apprehension and improvement of them,
   would do us little good, David very properly begins with hearing. We
   see how wicked men riot in the abundance of them, while yet they have
   no sense of the Lord's goodness, through want of attention to the word,
   and a believing apprehension of God as a father. The adverb in the
   morning some confine to a reference to sacrifices -- which is a meager
   interpretation -- in allusion to the well-known fact that sacrifices
   used to be offered twice, in the morning and in the evening. Others
   give a more strained sense, understanding that when God deals in a more
   favorable way with his people, he is said to form a new day. [253]
   Others consider it to be a metaphor for a prosperous and happy
   condition, as an afflicted and calamitous time is often denoted by
   darkness. I wonder that there should be such a search after extraneous
   meanings for this word, by which he is simply to be considered as
   repeating his former prayer to God -- make haste. In the morning means
   the same with speedily or seasonably. He founds a reason here, as
   elsewhere, upon his having hoped in God, this being something by which,
   in a sense, we lay God under obligation to us, for in making a liberal
   offer of himself to us, and promising to sustain the relationship of a
   father, he gives what men would call a pledge. This, accordingly, is a
   species of obligation. But so far is this from implying any worthiness
   or merit on our part, that the hope we entertain rather proves our
   nothingness and helplessness. His prayer that a way might be opened up
   for him to walk in, refers to the anxieties which perplexed him. He
   intimates that he was dismayed, and brought to a stand, unable to move
   a step, if God did not open a way, by his divine power; that all the
   desires of his soul terminated upon him; and that he looked for counsel
   from him to procure relief in his perplexity.

   9. Deliver me, O Jehovah! from my enemies. This prayer is to the same
   effect, his enemies being so earnestly bent upon his destruction as to
   leave no outgate for him. The verb ksyty, chisithi, some render to
   hope: the proper meaning is to cover, and I am unwilling to depart from
   it. The explanation some give is, that David upon perceiving the
   imminent danger to which he was exposed, betook himself to the covert
   of God's shadow, and concealed himself under the protection of it. This
   seems a very natural rendering, at least I prefer it to another which
   has recommended itself to some as being ingenious -- that David,
   instead of having recourse to various quarters for relief, was
   satisfied to have God cognizant of his case, and called upon him in a
   hidden manner and apart.

   10. Teach me that I may do thy will. He now rises to something higher,
   praying not merely for deliverance from outward troubles, but, what is
   of still greater importance, for the guidance of God's Spirit, that he
   might not decline to the right hand or to the left, but be kept in the
   path of rectitude. This is a request which should never be forgotten
   when temptations assail us with great severity, as it is peculiarly
   difficult to submit to God without resorting to unwarrantable methods
   of relief. As anxiety, fear, disease, languor, or pain, often tempt
   persons to particular steps, David's example should bad us to pray for
   divine restraint, and that we may not be hurried, through impulses of
   feeling, into unjustifiable courses. We are to mark carefully his way
   of expressing himself, for what he asks is not simply to be taught what
   the will of God is, but to be taught and brought to the observance, and
   doing of it. The former kind of teaching is of less avail, as upon
   God's showing us our duty we by no means necessarily follow it, and it
   is necessary that he should draw out our affections to himself. God
   therefore must be master and teacher to us not only in the dead letter,
   but by the inward motions of his Spirit; indeed there are three ways in
   which he acts the part of our teacher, instructing us by his word,
   enlightening our minds by the Spirit, and engraving instruction upon
   our hearts, so as to bring us observe it with a true and cordial
   consent. The mere hearing of the word would serve no purpose, nor is it
   enough that we understand it; there must be besides the willing'
   obedience of the heart. Nor does he merely say, Teach me that I may be
   capable of doing, as the deluded Papists imagine that the grace of God
   does no more than make us flexible to what is good, but he seeks
   something to be actually and presently done.

   He insists upon the same thing in the next clause, when he says, Let
   thy good Spirit lead me, etc., for he desires the guidance of the
   Spirit not merely as he enlightens our minds, but as he effectually
   influences the consent of our hearts, and as it were leads us by the
   hand. The passage in its connection warns us of the necessity of being
   sedulously on our guard against yielding to inordinate passions in any
   contests we may have with wicked persons, and as we have no sufficient
   wisdom or power of our own by which to check and restrain these
   passions, that we should always seek the guidance of God's Spirit, to
   keep them in moderation. More generally, the passage teaches us what we
   are to think of free will; for David here denies the will to have the
   power of judging rightly, till our hearts be formed to a holy obedience
   by the Spirit of God. The term leading, which I have already adverted
   to, proves also that David did not hold that middle species of grace
   which Papists talk so much about, and which leaves man in a state of
   suspension or indecision, but asserts something much more effectual,
   agreeably to what Paul says, (Philippians 2:13,) that

   "it is God who works in us both to will and to do
   of his good pleasure."

   By the words right hand, I understand, figuratively, uprightness;
   David's meaning being, that we are drawn into error whenever we decline
   from what is agreeable to the will of God. The term Spirit is tacitly
   opposed to that corruption which is natural to us; what he says being
   tantamount to this, that all men's thoughts are polluted and perverted,
   till reduced to right rule by the grace of the Spirit. It follows that
   nothing which is dictated by the judgment of the flesh is good or
   sound. I grant that wicked men are led away by an evil spirit sent from
   God, for he executes his judgments by the agency of devils, [254] (1
   Samuel 16:14;) but when David in this place speaks of God's good
   Spirit, I do not imagine that he has any such strained allusion, but
   rather that he takes here to himself the charge of corruption, and
   assigns the praise of whatever is good, upright, or true, to the Spirit
   of God. When he says, Because thou art my God, he shows that his
   confidence of obtaining his request was founded entirely upon the free
   favor and promises of God. It is not a matter lying within our own
   power to make him our God, but it rests with his free preventing grace.

   11. For thy name's sake, O Jehovah! etc. By this expression he makes it
   still more clear that it was entirely of God's free mercy that he
   looked for deliverance; for, had he brought forward anything of his
   own, the cause would not have been in God, and only in God. He is said
   to help us for his own name's sake, when, although he discovers nothing
   in us to conciliate his favor, he is induced to interpose of his mere
   goodness. To the same effect is the term righteousness; for God, as I
   have said elsewhere, has made the deliverance of his people a means of
   illustrating his righteousness. He at the same time repeats what he had
   said as to the extraordinary extent of his afflictions: in seeking to
   be quickened or made alive, he declares himself to be exanimated, and
   that he must remain under the power of death, if the God who has the
   issues of life did not recover him by a species of resurrection.

   12. And in thy mercy, etc. In this verse he repeats for the fifth or
   sixth time that he looked for life only of God's free mercy. Whatever
   severity may appear on the part of God when he destroys the wicked,
   David affirms that the vengeance taken upon them would be a proof of
   fatherly mercy to him. Indeed these two things often meet together --
   the severity and the goodness of God; for in stretching out his hand to
   deliver his own people, he directs the thunder of his indignation
   against their enemies. In short, he comes forth armed for the
   deliverance of his people, as he says in Isaiah,

   "The day of vengeance is in mine heart,
   and this is the year of my redemption." (Isaiah 63:4.)

   In calling himself The servant of God, he by no means boasts of his
   services, but rather commends the grace of God, to whom he owed this
   privilege. This is not an honor to be got by our own struggles or
   exertions -- to be reckoned among God's servants; it depends upon his
   free choice, by which he condescends before we are born to take us into
   the number and rank of his followers, as David elsewhere declares still
   more explicitly --

   "I am thy servant, truly I am thy servant,
   and the son of thine handmaid." (Psalm 116:16.)

   This is equivalent to making himself God's client, and committing his
   life to his protection.

   PSALM 144

   This Psalm contains a mixture of praise trod prayer; for David, while
   he extols in very high terms the great mercies which God had bestowed
   upon him, is led at the same time, either from a consideration of the
   many trials to be met with in the whole course of human life, or from
   the connection he still had with wicked men, to pray that God would
   continue to show this favor to the end. There is this difference
   between it and Psalm 18, [255] that the latter is triumphant
   throughout, the kingdom having been thoroughly subdued, and affairs
   going forward prosperously, whereas in the present he mixes up one or
   two things which are indicative of fear and anxiety, there being some
   remaining enemies to cause him apprehension. [256]

   A Psalm of David.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 144:1-4

   1. Blessed be Jehovah, my strength, who teaches my hands for battle, my
   fingers for war. 2. My goodness, and my munition, my citadel, and my
   deliverer, my shield, and in him I have hoped, who subdues my people
   under me. 3. O Jehovah! what is man that thou acknowledgest him? the
   son of man that thou thinkest of him? 4. Man is like to vanity: his
   deeds are as a shadow passing away.


   1. Blessed be Jehovah, my strength [257] It is very evident that David,
   since he celebrates the favor of God in such high terms, had not only
   obtained the kingdom, but gained signal victories. When he calls God
   his strength, he acknowledges that any courage he had was given him
   from above, not only because he had been made from a country shepherd a
   mighty warrior, but because the constancy and perseverance he had shown
   was signally a gift from God. This term answers better than were we to
   translate it rock; for, by way of explanation, he adds immediately
   afterwards, that he had been formed under God's teaching for war. The
   words certainly imply an acknowledgment, that though of a warlike
   spirit, he was not born for warlike enterprises but needed to undergo a
   change. What kind of a commencement, for example, did he show in the
   case of Goliah? That attempt would have been preposterous on any other
   supposition than his being upheld by secret divine support, so as to be
   independent of mere human help. (1 Samuel 17:40.)

   2. My goodness, etc. This way of using the word in a passive sense, as
   in the Hebrew, sounds harsh in Latin; just as elsewhere (Psalm 18:50)
   he calls himself "God's king," not in the sense of his having dominion
   over God, but being made and appointed king by him. Having experienced
   God's kindness in so many ways, he calls him "his goodness," meaning
   that whatever good he possessed flowed from him. The accumulation of
   terms, one upon another, which follows, may appear unnecessary, yet it
   tends greatly to strengthen faith. We know how unstable men's minds
   are, and especially how soon faith wavers, when they are assailed by
   some trial of more than usual severity. It is not enough, if God would
   sustain us under such weakness, to promise us his help in individual or
   single expressions; and, even however many aids he supplies us with, we
   are subject to very great vacillations, and a forgetfulness of his
   mercy creeps in upon us which almost overwhelms our minds. We are to
   remember that it is not merely in token of his gratitude that David
   heaps together so many terms in declaring the goodness of God, but to
   fortify God's people against all attacks of the world, and of the evil
   one. He had a reason for reckoning it among the chiefest of God's
   mercies, that he controlled the people under his government. For my,
   ami, my people, some read, mym, amim, peoples; [258] and it is
   surprising they should prefer such a forced rendering, as David means
   simply that the settled state of the kingdom was owing not to any
   counsel, valor, or authority of his own, but to God's secret favor. The
   verb rdd, radad, is used appropriately, signifying to spread out. The
   idea some have, that by a people spread out is meant a people set down
   at ease in a prosperous and happy condition, is farfetched. I have as
   great objections to the idea of others, that he means a people laid
   prostrate, so as that they may be trodden under foot; for a violent
   domination like this would not have been desirable over the chosen
   people, and sacred inheritance of the Lord. When a people yields a
   cordial and willing obedience to the laws, all subordinating themselves
   to their own place peaceably, this signally proves the divine blessing.
   And in such a settlement as this, where there is no turbulence, nor
   confusion, the people are appropriately represented, according to what
   we have said above, as being spread out. David accordingly having
   ascribed the victories he had gained over foreign enemies to God,
   thanks him at the same time for the settled state of the kingdom.
   Raised indeed as he was from an obscure station, and exposed to hatred
   from calumnious charges, it was scarcely to have been believed that he
   would ever obtain a peaceable reign. The people had suddenly and beyond
   expectation submitted to him, and so surprising a change was eminently
   God's work.

   3. O Jehovah! what is man, etc. He amplifies the goodness shown by God
   by instituting a comparison. Having declared how singularly he had been
   dealt with, he turns his eyes inward, and asks, "Who am I, that God
   should show me such condescension? "He speaks of man in general; only
   the circumstance is noticeable that he commends the mercy of God, by
   considering his lowly and abject condition. In other places he mentions
   grounds of humiliation of a more personal or private nature, -- here he
   confines himself to what has reference to our common nature; and though
   even in discussing the nature of man there are other reasons he might
   have specified why he is unworthy of the regard and love of God, he
   briefly adverts to his being like the smoke, and as a shadow. [259] We
   are left to infer that the riches of the divine goodness are extended
   to objects altogether unworthy in themselves. We are warned, when apt
   at any time to forget ourselves, and think we are something when we are
   nothing, that the simple fact of the shortness of our life should put
   down all arrogance and pride. The Scriptures, in speaking of the
   frailty of man, comprehend whatever is necessarily connected with it.
   And, indeed, if our life vanish in a moment, what is there stable about
   us? We taught this truth also -- that we cannot properly estimate the
   divine goodness, unless we take into consideration what we are as to
   our condition, as we can only ascribe to God what is due unto him, by
   acknowledging that his goodness is bestowed upon undeserving creatures.
   The reader may seek for further information upon this point in the
   eighth Psalm, where nearly the same truth is insisted upon.

   [257] "Ou, mon rocher." -- Fr. marg. "Or, my rock."

   [258] Those who conjecture that mym, amim, is the correct reading,
   refer to the parallel passage in Psalm 18:47, where the word is in the
   plural. They also observe in support of their opinion, that this
   reading is actually found in a great number of MSS. examined by
   Kennieott and De Rossi; and they account for my, ami, having got into
   the text by supposing that it was written in the first instance as a
   contraction for mym, amim. Rosenmuller supposes, but with less
   probability, that the original word was m, and that the letter y, yod,
   is paragogic, that is, has been annexed to improve the sound; m, am,
   being taken collectively. The Masorets have noticed that m, which the
   translators of our English Bible took to be m, with its possessive
   affix here, in 2 Samuel 22:44, and Lamentations 3:14, and consequently
   rendered by my people, is to be taken as the plural number of that
   noun.

   Psalm 144:5-8

   5. O Jehovah! bow thy heavens, [260] and descend: [261] touch the
   mountains, and they shall smoke. 6. Thunder forth thunderings, and
   scatter them; [262] shoot out thine arrows, and destroy them. 7. Send
   thy hand from above, rid me and deliver me out of great waters, from
   the hand of the sons of the stranger. 8. For their mouth hath spoken
   falsehood; and their right hand is a right hand of deceit.


   5. O Jehovah! bow thy heavens. After extolling, as was due, the great
   goodness of God, he requests him to furnish such help for the
   preservation of the kingdom as was necessary in the present exigency.
   As formerly we saw that he had gloried in God with a heroical courage,
   so here he makes use of the same lofty terms in his prayers, That he
   would bow the heavens -- that he would make the mountains to smoke --
   disturb the air with thunderings -- and shoot forth arrows; forms of
   speech by which, doubtless, he would put away from him all the
   obstacles which stand between us and a believing apprehension of the
   omnipotence of God, and from which we find it so difficult to emerge.
   He employs almost the same phraseology in the eighteenth Psalm, but it
   is in praising God for help already extended, and to signify that he
   had been preserved from above in a wonderful and unusual manner. For
   although such signs as he mentions might not always occur when God
   interposed in his behalf, he had good ground to celebrate what had
   happened to him of an unexpected kind, by reference to extraordinary
   phenomena. In the passage before us his purpose is different.
   Threatened by destruction of various kinds, which might overwhelm his
   mind with despair, he would realize the wonderful power of God, before
   which all obstacles of a worldly kind must necessarily give way. We may
   be certain at least that he indulged in this figurative phraseology for
   a good reason, that he might not confine deliverance to human remedies;
   for nothing could be more preposterous at such a time than to measure
   divine power by ordinary rules.

   7. Send thy hand, etc. In one word we are now made to see what was
   meant by the figures formerly used -- that in the absence of all
   earthly help, God would put forth his hand from above, the greatness of
   the exigency making extraordinary help necessary. Accordingly he
   compares his enemies to great and deep waters. He calls them strangers,
   not in respect of generic origin, but character and disposition. It
   were a mistake to refer the term to the uncircumcision, for David
   rather animadverts upon degenerate Jews who gloried in the flesh; and
   shortly afterwards he hints that he had to do with internal foes rather
   than a foreign enemy, who would openly assault him with violence and
   arms. By the right hand of falsehood some understand rash attempts,
   which David hoped would be frustrated. Others limit the phrase to the
   solemn ceremony of taking an oath, as if he said they were perjured;
   [263] while others explain it as meaning that they not only lied with
   the tongue, but executed wicked devices with the hand. [264] But as it
   was customary in making promises to join hands, as Solomon says,
   (Proverbs 11:21; Proverbs 16:5,) I have no doubt David's reference here
   is to false, treacherous, and perfidious persons. The two things go
   naturally together in the verse -- the lying tongue and the deceitful
   hand, meaning upon the matter that nothing was to be looked for from
   any of their promises, since it was only to deceive that they flattered
   with their mouth and gave the hand.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [260] "Bow thy heavens. This expression is derived from the appearance
   of the clouds during a tempest: they hang low, so as to obscure the
   hills and mountains, and seem to mingle heaven and earth together. Such
   an appearance is figuratively used to depict the coming of God, to
   execute vengeance upon the enemies of his people. See Psalm 18:10, and
   other instances." -- Walford

   [261] The verbs in this and the two following verses are in the
   imperative mood, whereas in the corresponding passages in the
   eighteenth Psalm they are in the past tense. This difference is best
   accounted for by supposing, with Calvin, that these verses are the
   language of prayer, uttered by David in a time of threatened danger
   from the enemies of his kingdom and people; whilst those of the
   eighteenth Psalm were spoken after some signal deliverance or
   deliverances had been vouchsafed.

   [262] "Scatter them. The antecedent of them' is peoples' in verse
   second." -- Walford.

   [263] "In taking an oath the right hand was lifted up. The enemies of
   David profaned their oaths by violating the covenants into which they
   entered, and breaking their solemn engagements." -- Walford.

   [264] "The meaning is, the hands with which they confirm their treaties
   of peace and leagues of friendship are immediately lifted up against
   the lives and liberties of their allies." -- Warner.

   Psalm 144:9-11

   9. O God! I will sing a new song to thee: upon the nablum, upon the
   psaltery, [265] I will sing psalms to thee. 10. Giving salvation to
   kings, delivering David his servant from the hurtful sword. 11. Deliver
   me, and rescue me from the hand of the sons of the stranger, whose
   mouth hath spoken falsehood, and their right hand is a right hand of
   deceit.


   9. O God! I will sing a new song to thee. He again sets himself, with
   self-possession, to the exercise of praising God, not doubting but he
   would continue those mercies which he had once bestowed. I have taken
   notice in another place that by a new song is meant one of a singular
   or uncommon kind; and we are left from this to infer that David's
   expectations stretched beyond the conclusions of man's judgment; for,
   with a view to the greatness of the help to be extended, he promises a
   song of praise unprecedented in its nature, and distinguished, by the
   title here applied to it, from ordinary thanksgiving's. As to the
   nablum and psaltery, I have elsewhere observed that they formed part of
   that system of training under the law to which the Church was subjected
   in its infancy. But the chief thing to be noticed is the subject of his
   songs that God, who is the preserver of kings, had kept -- and even
   rescued from the sword -- David, whom he had made and anointed king by
   his authoritative decree. As to the idea of there being implied in the
   term kings an opposition to the commonalty, David meaning that not only
   the common class of people are indebted to divine preservation, but the
   more influential, and such as appear to have sufficient and abundant
   strength of their own, I question whether it be well founded. His
   meaning seems to me rather to be different from this, That while God
   preserves all men without exception, his care is peculiarly extended to
   the maintenance of political order, which is the foundation of the
   common safety of all. It is in effect as if he called him the guardian
   and defender of kingdoms; for as the very mention of government is an
   odious thing, and none willingly obeys another, and nothing is more
   contrary to natural inclination than servitude, men would seek to throw
   off the yoke, and subvert the thrones of kings, were these not hedged
   round by a hidden divine presidency. David, however, distinguishes
   himself from other kings, as elsewhere he is called "the firstborn of
   kings," (Psalm 89:27;) at least he speaks of the goodness of God as
   having been preeminently shown to him, representing himself as holding
   the highest place, on account of the holy anointing which had been more
   eminently bestowed upon him. As a title of distinction, he claims the
   special name of God's servant; for although all kings are God's
   servants, and Cyrus has the name applied to him by Isaiah emphatically,
   (Isaiah 45:1,) yet as no heathen prince ever recognized himself as
   called of God, and David alone of all others in the world was invested
   with legitimate authority, and had a warrant to reign which faith could
   rest upon with certainty, it was not without reason that this mark of
   distinction is applied to him. By the hurtful sword, are doubtless
   meant all the dangers he had passed through for a series of years,
   which were such that he might be truly said to have come to the throne
   by deaths oft, and to have been settled upon the throne in the midst of
   them.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [265] In the French version it is -- "Upon the psaltery, and upon an
   instrument of ten strings." It is evident that Calvin supposed two
   instruments to be here mentioned. This, however, has been doubted. The
   rendering in the Hebrew text is -- vnvl svr, benebel asor, "with a
   nobel (or psaltery, as the term is translated in our English Bible) ten
   (stringed)." Thus only one musical instrument may be indicated -- "the
   psaltery of ten strings." In Psalm 33:2, we read similarly, vnvl svr,
   benebel asor, "with the psaltery ten (stringed)." In Psalm 42:3,
   however, nebel and asor are represented as two distinct musical
   instruments. We there read, ly'-svr vly-nvl, ale-asor veale-nabel,
   "upon the asor or ten (stringed instrument), and upon the nebel or
   psaltery." But whatever inference may be drawn from the independent
   exhibition of asor in that text, yet in the passage before us, and in
   Psalm 33:2, if we may judge from the construction, it seems rather to
   represent the number of strings of the common nebel or psaltery, or a
   particular variety of that instrument, than to be a distinct musical
   instrument. With respect to the Hebrew nebel from which comes the
   nablos; of the Greeks, and the nablum of the Latins, our information is
   very limited and indistinct. It is supposed to have been a stringed
   instrument of the harp or lyre kind, and appears to have been of the
   triangular form. As it is not noticed in Scripture earlier than the
   days of David, it is not considered of equal antiquity with some other
   musical instruments. It was formed of precious wood, as we learn from 1
   Kings 10:12, and ultimately, according to Josephus, of that species of
   precious mixed metal called electrum. From its being never mentioned in
   the Sacred Writings, except in connection with the worship of the
   sanctuary, it has been conjectured that it was not used in private, and
   that it was probably larger, and more costly, than other instruments of
   a similar kind. Josephus says that it was played upon with the fingers,
   and had twelve strings. The number of strings may, however, have varied
   according to circumstances.

   Psalm 144:12-15

   12. Because our sons are as plants which have grown up in their youth,
   our daughters as corners polished after the similitude of a palace.
   [266] 13. Our recesses [or corners] full, going out, [267] from kind to
   kind; our sheep brining forth to thousands, to ten thousands, [268] in
   our streets. [269] 14. Our oxen accustomed [270] to the burden, no
   breach, nor going out, nor cry in our streets. 15. Happy the people to
   whom it is so! happy the people whose God is Jehovah!


   12. Because our sons, etc. These three concluding verses some consider
   as being a wish or a prayer. [271] Others think that David
   congratulates himself, and all the people, that through the divine
   blessing every species of mercy was showered down prosperously upon
   them. I have no doubt that David commemorates, by way of thanksgiving,
   the liberality which God had shown to his people. But it consists very
   well with this, to suppose that he prays at the same time for the
   continuance or preservation of those divine benefits which must
   well-nigh be cut off altogether by wicked men and domestic foes, unless
   God should interpose, in the troubles and confusions which prevailed.
   The end he has in view therefore is, that God would not suffer the
   signal blessings with which he had loaded his people to fail and
   depart. He begins by making mention of the children, comparing the male
   portion of them, by way of commendation of their excellency, to plants
   which have grown up in their youth; for trees rarely come to any height
   if they do not grow large early, and when yet tender. He speaks of the
   girls as being like corners skillfully and ingeniously cut out, to make
   the building beautiful; as if he would say that they adorned the house
   by their comeliness and elegance. It is not surprising that he should
   reckon a noble and well trained offspring to be the very first of God's
   earthly blessings, a point of which I have spoken elsewhere more at
   large. As David speaks in the name of the whole people, and of his own
   condition as mixed up with that of the community, we may infer from
   this that he was not exclusively occupied with his own private
   interests.

   13. Our recesses full, etc. Some read storehouses, [272] and I would
   not reject this meaning. But as the word comes from the same root with
   zvh, zavah, which is rendered corner in the previous verse, it seems
   more agreeable to the etymology to translate the words as I have done
   -- "that the recesses or corners were full." The participle mphyqym,
   mephikim, some take transitively, and read producing, but the meaning
   comes to the same thing, that abundance of every blessing flowed from
   all the corners, expression mzn 'l-zn, mizan el-zan, [273] seems to me
   to denote the variety and manifold nature of the blessings, rather
   than, as some interpreters think, so abundant a produce as would issue
   in the different species being mixed, and forming a confused heap owing
   to the unmanageable plenty. We have no need to have recourse to this
   strained hyperbole, and the words as they stand evidently do not favor
   that sense, for had a confused heap been meant, it would have read
   simply zn zn, zan. The meaning in short is, that there prevailed
   amongst the people such plenty, not only of wheat, but all kinds of
   produce, that every corner was filled to sufficiency with every
   variety.

   14. Our oxen, etc. The Hebrew word svl, sabal, is properly to carry.
   Accordingly some understand msvvlym, mesubbalim, to mean robust, [274]
   as unless they were strong oxen they would not be fit for carriage, or
   bearing burdens. Others think they are spoken of as laden with fat.
   There is no need for insisting upon this point, as it does not affect
   the main scope of the passage. It may be more important to notice, that
   God's fatherly care of his people is celebrated on the account that he
   condescends to attend to every the smallest matter which concerns their
   advantage. As in the verse before he had ascribed the fruitfulness of
   the herds and flocks to God's goodness, so now the fattening of their
   oxen, to show that there is nothing relating to us here which he
   overlooks. As it would signify little to have abundance of everything
   unless we could enjoy it, he takes notice of it as another part of the
   Lord's kindness that the people were peaceable and quiet. By breach I
   have no doubt that he alludes to hostile incursions, that there was no
   enemy to break in upon them through demolished gates or walls. By
   goings out it is surprising that any should understand exile, that the
   people were not torn away from the bounds of their native country. All
   he means simply is, in my opinion, that there was no necessity of
   sallying out to repel an enemy, none offering violence or molestation.
   To the same effect is the expression, as to any crying in the streets,
   the effect of a sudden tumult. The meaning is, accordingly, that there
   was no disturbance in the cities, because God kept enemies at a
   distance.

   15. Happy the people, etc. He thus concludes that the divine favor had
   been sufficiently shown and manifested to his people. Should any object
   that it breathed altogether a gross and worldly spirit to estimate
   man's happiness by benefits of a transitory description, I would say in
   reply that we must read the two things in connection, that those are
   happy who recognize the favor of God in the abundance they enjoy, and
   have such a sense of it from these transitory blessings as leads them
   through a persuasion of his fatherly love to aspire after the true
   inheritance. There is no impropriety in calling those happy whom God
   blesses in this world, provided they do not show themselves blinded in
   the improvement and use which they make of their mercies, or foolishly
   and supinely overlook the author of them. The kind providence of God in
   not suffering us to want any of the means of life is surely a striking
   illustration of his wonderful love. What more desirable than to be the
   objects of God's care, especially if we have sufficient understanding
   to conclude from the liberality with which he supports us he is our
   Father? For everything is to be viewed with a reference to this point.
   Better it were at once to perish for want than have a mere brute
   satisfaction, and forget the main thing of all, that they and they only
   are happy whom God has chosen for his people. We are to observe this,
   that while God in giving us meat and drink admits us to the enjoyment
   of a certain measure of happiness, it does not follow that those
   believers are miserable who struggle through life in want and poverty,
   for this want, whatever it be, God can counterbalance by better
   consolations.

   [255] The ideas and the phraseology of a considerable part of this

   [256] The occasion on which this Psalm was written can only be
   conjectured. The Septuagint, Vulgate, Aethiopic, and Arabic versions
   entitle it "A Psalm of David against Goliah;" and that the Chaldee
   paraphrast took this to be the subject of the Psalm is evident from his
   reading in verse 10th, "the sword of Goliah." Judging, however, from
   internal evidence, the enemies referred to seem rather to be those of
   David and his kingdom, after he ascended the throne. Some refer the
   Psalm to David's war with the Ammonites and Syrians, recorded in 2
   Samuel 10; and it may have been composed by him when about to encounter
   these hostile powers.

   PSALM 145

   The Psalmist is led to celebrate the praises of God by reflecting upon
   his excellent wisdom, goodness, and righteousness, both in the
   government of the world generally, and particularly in managing,
   superintending, and defending the children of men. After recounting in
   general the praises of his providence, he comes to speak of the special
   favor shown by him to his own people.

   The Praise of David [275]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 145:1-6

   1. I will extol thee, my God and my king! [276] and I will bless thy
   name for ever and ever. 2. Daily I will bless thee, and will praise thy
   name for ever and ever. [277] 3. Great is Jehovah, and greatly to be
   praised, and there is no searching out, his greatness. 4. Generation to
   generation, will praise thy works, and will show forth thy power. 5. I
   will meditate upon [278] the beauty of the glory of thy excellency, and
   the words of thy wonderful things. 6. And they shall speak of the might
   of thy terrible works, and I will declare thy greatness.


   1. I will extol thee, my God and my king. David does not so much tell
   what he would do himself, as stir up and urge all others to this
   religious service of offering to God the praises due to his name. The
   design with which he declares God to be beneficent to the children of
   men is, to induce them to cultivate a pious gratitude, he insists upon
   the necessity of persevering in the exercise; for since God is constant
   in extending mercies, it would be highly improper in us to faint in his
   praises. As he thus gives his people new ground for praising him, so he
   stimulates them to gratitude, and to exercise it throughout the whole
   course of their life. In using the term daily, he denotes perseverance
   in the exercise. Afterwards he adds, that should he live through a
   succession of ages he would never cease to act in this manner. The
   repetitions used tend very considerably to give emphasis to his
   language. As it is probable that the Psalm was written at a time when
   the kingdom of David was in a flourishing condition, the circumstances
   deserves notice, that in calling God his king he gives both himself and
   other earthly princes their proper place, and does not allow any
   earthly distinctions to interfere with the glory due to God.

   This is made still more manifest in the verse which follows, where, in
   speaking of the greatness of God as unmeasurable, he intimates that we
   only praise God aright when we are filled and overwhelmed with an
   ecstatic admiration of the immensity of his power. This admiration will
   form the fountain from which our just praises of him will proceed,
   according the measure of our capacity.

   4. Generation to generation, etc. Here he insists upon the general
   truth, that all men were made and are preserved in life for this end,
   that they may devote themselves to the praise of God. And there is an
   implied contrast between the eternal name of God, and that immortality
   of renown which great men seem to acquire by their exploits. Human
   excellencies are eulogized in histories; with God it stands
   differently, for there is not a day in which he does not renew
   remembrance of his works, and cherish it by some present effect, so as
   indelibly to preserve it alive upon our minds. For the same reason he
   speaks of the glorious brightness, or beauty of his excellence, the
   better to raise in others a due admiration of it. By the words of his
   wonderful works, I consider that there is an allusion to the
   incomprehensible method of God's works, for so many are the wonders
   that they overwhelm our senses. And we may infer from this, that the
   greatness of God is not that which lies concealed in his mysterious
   essence, and in subtle disputation upon which, to the neglect of his
   works, many have been chargeable with mere trifling, for true religion
   demands practical not speculative knowledge. Having said that he would
   speak of, or meditate upon God's works, (for the Hebrew word, 'sychh,
   asichah, as we have elsewhere seen, may be rendered either way,) he
   transfers his discourse to others, intimating, that there will always
   be some in the world to declare the righteousness, goodness, and wisdom
   of God, and that his divine excellencies are worthy of being sounded,
   with universal consent, by every tongue. And, should others desist and
   defraud God of the honor due to him, he declares that he would himself
   at least discharge his part, and, while they were silent, energetically
   set forth the praises of God. Some think, that the might of his
   terrible works is an expression to the same effect with what had been
   already stated. But it seems rather to denote the judgments of God
   against profane scoffers.

   Psalm 145:7-13

   7. They shall steak forth [or, utter copiously] the memory of the
   greatness of thy goodness, and shall sing of thy righteousness. 8.
   Jehovah is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger, and great in
   mercy. 9. Jehovah is good to all, and his mercies above all his works.
   10. All thy works shall praise thee, O Jehovah! and thy merciful ones
   shall bless thee. 11. They shall speak the glory of thy kingdom, and
   shall talk of thy power. 12. That they may make known his powers to the
   sons of men, and the glory of the beauty of his kingdom. 13. Thy
   kingdom is a kingdom of all ages, and thy dominion unto all successive
   generations. [279]


   7. They shall speak forth, etc. As the verb nv, nabang, means properly
   to gush out, some suppose, that, as applied to speech, it means not
   simply speaking, but an overflowing utterance, like water rushing from
   a fountain, and the verb yrnnv, yerannenu, in the close of the verse,
   answers to this, meaning to shout, or sing aloud. To celebrate the
   memory of the Lord's goodness, is the same with recalling to memory
   what we have personally experienced of his goodness. We cannot deny
   God's claim to praise in all his excellencies, but we are most sensibly
   affected by such proofs of his fatherly mercy as we have ourselves
   experienced. David makes use, therefore, of this alluring consideration
   to induce us the more readily and cheerfully to engage in the praises
   of God, or rather, (according to the figurative word already used,) to
   burst forth in celebration of them.

   8. Jehovah is gracious, etc. He opens up the goodness of which he spoke
   by using several expressions, as that God is inclined to mercy, (for
   such is the proper meaning of the word chnvn, channun,) and that he
   helps us willingly, as one sympathizing with our miseries. It is to be
   noticed that David has borrowed the terms which he here applies to God
   from that celebrated passage in Exodus 34:6; and as the inspired
   writers drew their doctrine from the fountain of the law, we need not
   wonder that they set a high value upon the vision which is there
   recorded, and in which as clear and satisfactory a description of the
   nature of God is given us as can anywhere be found. David, therefore,
   in giving us a brief statement of what it was most important we should
   know in reference to God, makes use of the same terms employed there.
   Indeed no small part of the grace of God is to be seen in his alluring
   us to himself by such attractive titles. Were he to bring his power
   prominently into view before us, we would be cast down by the terror of
   it rather than encouraged, as the Papists represent him a dreadful God,
   from whose presence all must fly, whereas the proper view of him is
   that which invites us to seek after him. Accordingly, the more nearly
   that a person feels himself drawn to God, the more has he advanced in
   the knowledge of him. If it be true that God is not only willing to
   befriend us, but is spoken of as touched with sympathy for our
   miseries, so as to be all the kinder to us the more that we are
   miserable, what folly were it not to fly to him without delay? But as
   we drive God's goodness away from us by our sins, and block up the way
   of access, unless his goodness overcome this obstacle, it would be in
   vain that the Prophets spoke of his grace and mercy. [280] It was
   necessary, therefore, to add what follows, that great is his mercy,
   that he pardons sins, and bears with the wickedness of men, so as to
   show favor to the unworthy. As regards the ungodly, although God shows
   them his long-suffering patience, they are incapable of perceiving
   pardon, so that the doctrine on which we insist has a special
   application to believers only, who apprehend God's goodness by a living
   faith. To the wicked it is said --

   "To what end is the day of the Lord for you? the day of the Lord is
   darkness and not light, affliction and not joy."
   (Amos 5:18.)

   We see in what severe terms Nahum threatens them at the very beginning
   of his prophecy. Having referred to the language used in the passage
   from Moses, he adds immediately, on the other hand, to prevent them
   being emboldened by it, that God is a rigid and severe, a terrible and
   an inexorable judge. (Nahum 1:3.) They therefore who have provoked God
   to anger by their sins, must see to secure his favor by believing.

   9. Jehovah is good to all, etc. The truth here stated is of wider
   application than the former, for the declaration of David is to the
   effect, that not only does God, with fatherly indulgence and clemency,
   forgive sin, but is good to all without discrimination, as he makes his
   sun to rise upon the good and upon the wicked. (Matthew 5:45.)
   Forgiveness of sin is a treasure from which the wicked are excluded,
   but their sin and depravity does not prevent God from showering down
   his goodness upon them, which they appropriate without being at all
   sensible of it. Meanwhile believers, and they only, know what it is to
   enjoy a reconciled God, as elsewhere it is said --

   "Come ye to him, and be ye enlightened, and your faces shall not be
   ashamed; taste and see that the Lord is good."
   (Psalm 34:5, 8.)

   When it is added that the mercy of God extends to all his works, this
   ought not to be considered as contrary to reason, or obscure. Our sins
   having involved the whole world in the curse of God, there is
   everywhere an opportunity for the exercise of God's mercy, even in
   helping the brute creation.

   10. All thy works, etc. Though many would suppress God's praises,
   observing a wicked silence regarding them, David declares that they
   shine forth everywhere, appear of themselves, and are sounded, as it
   were, by the very dumb creatures. He then assigns the special work of
   declaring them to believers, who have eyes to perceive God's works, and
   know that they cannot be employed better than in celebrating his
   mercies. What is added -- they shall speak the glory of thy kingdom --
   I consider to have reference only to believers. If any incline to think
   that these words rather apply to God's creatures universally, I would
   not object to that view. But the particular kind of speaking or
   teaching which David here refers to, applies only to saints.
   Accordingly I have retained the future tense of the verbs, rather than
   the optative mood, as others have done. In using the term kingdom,
   David intimates that this is the tendency of the manifestation of God's
   works, to reduce the whole world to a state of order, and subject it to
   his government. He insists upon the excellency of this kingdom, that
   men may know that things are to be considered as in disorder and
   confusion, unless God alone be acknowledged supreme. He denies it to be
   transitory, like all earthly kingdoms, asserting that it will stand
   fast for ever. And to call our attention more particularly to its
   everlasting nature, he breaks out into an admiring exclamation, and
   addresses his discourse to God.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [279] After this verse two lines appear to have been lost in the Hebrew
   text. The Psalm, as we have said before, is alphabetical; and each
   stanza begins with a letter of the Hebrew alphabet in regular order,
   till we come to Psalm 145:14, when a break -- the only one in the Psalm
   -- takes place. Psalm 145:13 begins with the letter m, mem, and Psalm
   145:14 with the letter s, samech. Thus the stanza beginning with the
   letter, n, nun, is wanting. It is thus supplied in the Septuagint:
   Pistos Kurios en pasi tois logois autou kai hosios en pasi tois ergois
   autou. "Faithful is Jehovah in all his words, and holy in all his
   works." Dr. Adam Clarke, after observing that there is not a verse
   answering to n, nun, in any of the printed copies of the Hebrew Bible,
   states, that there is one MS., now in Trinity College, Dublin, which
   has it thus (he supposes by correction) at the bottom of the page: n'mn
   yhvh vkl dvryv vtsyd vkl msyv Neeman Yehovah be-cal debaraiv; ve-chasid
   be-cal maasaiv. This exactly corresponds with the reading in the
   Septuagint. "Nothing," says Dr. Lowth in Merrick's Annotations on the
   Psalms, "can be more certain than the genuineness of the verse n which
   the Septuagint has preserved, varying only in two words from Psalm
   145:17."

   Psalm 145:14-16

   14. Jehovah upholding all the falling, [281] and raising up all who are
   bowed down. 15. The eyes of all hope in thee, and thou givest them
   their food in its season. 16. Thou openest thine hand, and satisfiest
   every living thing by thy good pleasure.


   14. Jehovah upholding all the falling. He gives instances of the
   goodness and mercy of God, such as make it evident that God reigns only
   for the promotion of the general welfare of mankind. By the falling,
   and those who are bowed down, he means figuratively those who are
   overwhelmed by adversity, and would sink at once, were not God to
   extend his hand for their support. God, in short, has respect to the
   troubles of men, and helps such as are in distress, so that all ought
   not only to look upon his divine government with reverence, but
   willingly and cordially submit themselves to it. Another lesson taught
   us is, that none will be disappointed who seeks comfort from God in his
   affliction.

   15. The eyes of all hope in thee. David adduces an additional proof of
   God's goodness, in giving food to all living creatures, and thus
   showing himself in the character of the father of a family. Some
   interpreters, led by the term hope, which is employed, restrict the
   application to men, as being endued with reason and intelligence, to
   seek their food from their heavenly father, while the beasts seek it
   only in a gross manner, by sight or smell. But although not endued with
   the exercise of reason, leading them to depend upon God's providence,
   necessity itself forces even them, by a certain hidden instinct, to
   seek their food, so that they may very properly be said to hope in God,
   as elsewhere the young ravens are said to cry unto him. (Psalm 147:9.)
   Besides, those who would restrict the words to man, still leave them
   open to the charge of impropriety; for the wicked have no regard to the
   fatherly care of God, more than the ox or the ass. Since such is the
   order established in nature that all animals are brought to a
   dependence upon their Maker, there is no impropriety in supposing the
   affection of desire or expectation to be here put for the fact of
   dependence itself. [282] All ambiguity is taken away by the next verse,
   where every living thing is said to be satisfied. It is said that he
   gives them their food, and in its season, for the very variety of it
   serves more to illustrate the providence of God. Each has its own way
   of feeding, and the different kinds of aliment are designed and adapted
   for different uses. David therefore speaks of that food which is
   particular to them. The pronoun is not in the plural, and we are not to
   read in their season, as if it applied to the animals. The food he
   notices as given in its season; for here also we are to notice the
   admirable arrangements of divine providence, that there is a certain
   time appointed for harvest, vintage, and hay crop, and that the year is
   so divided into intervals, that the cattle are fed at one time upon
   grass, at another on hay, or straw, or acorns, or other products of the
   earth. Were the whole supply poured forth at one and the same moment,
   it could not be gathered together so conveniently; and we have no small
   reason to admire the seasonableness with which the different kinds of
   fruit and aliment are yearly produced.

   16. Thou openest thine hand, etc. The figure is a beautiful one. Most
   men pass over without observation the singular goodness of God apparent
   in this admirable ordering of things in nature, and David therefore
   represents him as stretching out his hand to distribute to the animals
   their food. We sinfully confine our attention to the earth which yields
   us our food, or to natural causes. To correct this error David
   describes God as opening his hands to put the food into our mouths. The
   word rtsvn, ratson, some render desire, as though he meant that God
   supplied each kind of animal with food according to its wish. And a
   little afterwards we do indeed find it used in that sense. Others,
   however, refer it rather to God's feeding them of his mere good
   pleasure and kindness; it not being enough to say that our food is
   given us by God, unless we add, as in the second clause of the verse,
   that his kindness is gratuitous, and that there is no extrinsic cause
   whatever moving him to provide so liberally for every living creature.
   In that case the cause is put for the effect; the various kinds of
   provision being effects of his good pleasure -- charismata tes
   charitos. If it be found that men and others of his creatures often
   suffer and die from want, this is to be traced to the change which has
   come upon nature by sin. The fair order which subsisted in it by God's
   original appointment often fails since the fall through our sins, and
   yet in what remains of it, though marred, we may see the kindness of
   God referred to by David, for in the severest failures of crop, there
   is no year so barren and unproductive, that God may not be said to open
   his hand in it.

   Psalm 145:17-21

   17. Jehovah is righteous in all his ways, and merciful in all his
   works. 18. Jehovah is near to all who call upon him, to all who call
   upon him in truth. 19. He will perform the desire of them that fear
   him, and will hear their cry, and will save them. 20. Jehovah preserves
   all them that love him, and will destroy all the wicked. 21. My mouth
   shall speak the praise of Jehovah, and all, flesh shall bless his holy
   name for ever and ever.


   17. Jehovah is righteous in all his ways. He does not now speak of
   God's goodness merely in providing all his creatures with their daily
   food, but comprehends other parts of his providence, as in correcting
   men for their sins, restraining the wicked, trying the patience of his
   people under the cross, and governing the world by judgments which are
   often inscrutable to us. The ground upon which praise is here ascribed
   to God may seem a common one, being in every one's mouth; but in
   nothing is wisdom shown more than in holding fast the truth, that God
   is just in all his ways, so as to retain in our hearts an unabated
   sense of it amidst all troubles and confusions. Though all acknowledge
   God to be just, most men are no sooner overtaken by affliction than
   they quarrel with his severity: unless their wishes are immediately
   complied with, they are impatient, and nothing is more common than to
   hear his justice impeached. As it is everywhere abused by the wicked
   imputations men cast upon it, here it is very properly vindicated from
   such ungrateful treatment, and asserted to be constant and unfailing,
   however loudly the word may disparage it. It is expressly added, in all
   his ways and works, for we fail to give God due honor unless we
   recognize a consistent tenor of righteousness in the whole progress of
   his operation. Nothing is more difficult in the time of trouble, when
   God has apparently forsaken us, or afflicts us without cause, than to
   restrain our corrupt feelings from breaking out against his judgments;
   as we are told of the emperor Mauricius in a memorable passage of
   history, that seeing his sons murdered by the wicked and perfidious
   traitor Phocas, and being about to be carried out himself to death, he
   cried out -- "Thou art righteous, O God, and just are thy judgments!"
   As this man of no bad character opposed such a shield to the cruel
   trials he met with, we must learn to put a check upon our spirits, and
   always give God's righteousness the honor due to it. David, however,
   goes farther still, intimating that God, even when he seems to be most
   severe, is so far from being cruel as to temper his heaviest judgments
   with equity and clemency.

   18. Jehovah is near to all that call upon him. This truth is
   principally applicable to believers, whom God in the way of singular
   privilege invites to draw near him, promising that he will be favorable
   to their prayers. Faith, there is no doubt, lies idle and even dead
   without prayer, in which the spirit of adoption shows and exercises
   itself, and by which we evidence that all his promises are considered
   by us as stable and sure. The inestimable grace of God, in short,
   towards believers, appears in this, that he exhibits himself to them as
   a Father. As many doubts steal upon us when we pray to God, and we
   either approach him with trembling, or fail by becoming discouraged and
   lifeless, David declares it to be true without exception, that God
   hears all who call upon him. At the same time, as most men pervert and
   profane the method of calling upon God through inventions of their own,
   the right manner of praying is laid down in the next part of the verse,
   which is, that we should pray in truth. Although men resort to God in a
   cold manner, or even in their prayers expostulate with him, while their
   hearts are swelling with pride or with anger, they yet complain that
   they are not heard; just as if there were no difference between praying
   and quarreling, or the exercise of faith and hypocrisy. The greater
   part of men, involved in infidelity, scarcely believe that there is a
   God in heaven at all; others would banish him from it if they could;
   others would tie him down to their views and, wishes, while some seek
   slight and insufficient ways of reconciling him, so that the common way
   of praying is but an idle and empty ceremony. [283] And although nearly
   all men without exception have recourse to God in the time of their
   need, they are few indeed who bring the smallest measure of faith or
   repentance. It were better that the name of God should be buried in
   oblivion than exposed to such insults. There is good reason, therefore,
   why truth should be said to be necessary in our prayers -- that they
   come from a sincere heart. The falsehood, which is the opposite of this
   sincerity, is of various kinds; indeed it were difficult to enumerate
   them -- infidelity, wavering, impatience, murmuring, pretended
   humility, in short there are as many sorts of it as there are sinful
   dispositions. The truth being one of no small importance, David again
   confirms and enlarges upon it in the next verse. The repetition is
   worthy of our particular notice, for such is our tendency to unbelief,
   that there are few who in calling upon God do not look upon their
   prayers as fruitless. Hence the perverse manner in which the wandering
   minds of men are tossed hither and thither, as in the Papacy they
   invented patrons without number, holding it of no importance almost to
   embrace with an unwavering faith the promises by which God invites us
   to himself.

   To throw the door still more open, the Holy Spirit, by the mouth of
   David, tells us, that God will accommodate himself to the desires of
   all who fear him. This is a mode of expression of which it is difficult
   to say how much it ought to impress our minds. Who is man, that God
   should show complaisance to his will, when rather it is ours to look up
   to his exalted greatness, and humbly submit to his authority? Yet he
   voluntarily condescends to these terms, to obtemper our desires. At the
   same time, there is a check to be put upon this liberty, and we have
   not a license of universal appetency, as if his people might forwardly
   clamor for whatever their corrupt desires listed, but before God says
   that he will hear their prayers, he enjoins the law of moderation and
   submission upon their affections, as we learn from John, --

   "We know that he will deny us nothing,
   if we seek it according to his will." (1 John 5:14.)

   For the same reason, Christ dictated that form of prayer, "Thy will be
   done," setting limits round us, that we should not preposterously
   prefer our desires to those of God, nor ask without deliberation what
   first comes into our mouth. David, in making express mention of them
   that fear God, enjoins fear, reverence, and obedience upon them before
   holding out the favorable indulgence of God, that they might not think
   themselves warranted to ask more than his word grants and approves.
   When he speaks of their cry, this is a kind of qualification of what he
   had said. For God's willingness to grant our prayers is not always so
   apparent that he answers them at the very moment they are made. We
   have, therefore, need of perseverance in this trial of our faith, and
   our desires must be confirmed by crying. The last clause -- he will
   save them -- is also added by way of correction, to make us aware how
   far, and for what end God answers the prayers of his people, namely, to
   evidence in a practical manner that he is the faithful guardian of
   their welfare.

   20. Jehovah preserves, etc. He insists upon the same truth, -- that God
   is near to his people to help them in the time of need; this being a
   sure proof of his presence, that by his mercy they come safe and unhurt
   out of every danger which befalls them. It is worthy of our notice,
   that, instead of fear, he now speaks of love; for, in distinguishing
   believers by this title, that they love God, he intimates it to be the
   root of true godliness, that they submit themselves to him voluntarily,
   which again is the effect of faith. Till God draw us by the attractions
   of his grace, this placid submission will never follow. The love spoken
   of by David, however, is perhaps more extensive, as God's people not
   only attach themselves to him in the way of obedience to his authority,
   but knowing that union to him is of all other things most desirable,
   aspire with their whole soul after this happiness. Still there can be
   no doubt, that the reference is to it here as the chief part of
   holiness and righteousness, as was said by Moses,

   "And now, O Israel, what does the Lord thy God require of thee," etc.
   (Deuteronomy 10:12.)

   This effect of godliness in securing our safety and preservation under
   the divine guardianship, David exemplifies by an opposition clause,
   declaring, that all the wicked shall, in the just judgment of God,
   miserably perish. That he might close as he had begun, he again
   affirms, that he will publish the praises of God, and urges all to the
   same duty by his example. Some would read, every living thing shall
   bless, but this does not seem to me a proper reading. When Moses,
   speaking of the flood, says, that "all flesh in which was the breath of
   life perished," I grant that the term comprehends the brute creation,
   but wherever "flesh" is mentioned without any addition, the reference
   is only to men. Nor is David here stating what they would, but what
   they should do, declaring all men bound by the great and inexhaustible
   goodness of God constantly and for ever to praise him.

   [275] This Psalm is with much propriety entitled "Praise of David;" for
   it is throughout a continued celebration of the perfections and doings
   of God. It is certainly one of the most interesting and beautiful of
   the compositions of the sweet singer of Israel; and so high an opinion
   did the ancient Hebrews form of it that they were wont to say --
   "Whoever utters this Psalm thrice each day with the heart and tongue is
   a happy man, and shall infallibly enjoy the blessings of the world to
   come." The time and occasion of its composition can only be
   conjectured. Dr. Morison thinks it probable that it was composed by
   David when he and the nation of Israel obtained the blessings which he
   implored in the preceding Psalm; and that it is that new song which he
   purposed to sing (Psalm 144:9) when God appeared in glory for his
   chosen people. This is the last of the alphabetical Psalms. The first
   verse commences with the first letter of the Hebrew alphabet, the
   second verse with the second letter, and so on to the close, with the
   exception that the hemistich of which n, nun, was the commencing letter
   is wanting. The other alphabetical Psalms are Psalm 25, Psalm 34, Psalm
   37, Psalm 111, Psalm 112, Psalm 119.

   PSALM 146 [284]

   After stirring up himself, and others by his example, to praise God,
   David animadverts upon the diseased disposition, almost universally
   prevalent, to deceive ourselves by expectations entertained from
   various quarters. He, at the same time, points out the remedy -- that
   our whole hope should be centered in God. To persuade us to resort to
   him more readily, he touches shortly upon some proofs of his power and
   mercy.

   Hallelujah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 146:1-5

   1. Praise Jehovah, O my soul! 2. I will praise Jehovah in my life; I
   will sing psalms to my God so long as I shall have being. 3. Trust not
   in princes; in the son of man in whom there is not safety. 4. His
   breath shall go forth; he shall return to his earth, in that day his
   thoughts [285] shall perish. 5. Blessed is he whose help is the God of
   Jacob, whose hope is in Jehovah, his God.


   1. Praise Jehovah. The five last Psalms close with the same word with
   which they begin. [286] But having in general called upon all to praise
   God, he addresses himself, or, which is the same thing, his soul, only
   that under the name of soul he addresses his inward self more
   emphatically. We may infer from this, that the influence which moved
   him was not volatile and superficial, (as many will blame themselves
   with remissness on this point, and then immediately lapse into it
   again,) but a staid and constant affection, followed up by activity,
   and proved by its effects not to be feigned. As David felt, that good
   endeavors are frustrated or hindered through the craft of Satan, he
   thinks it proper to apply a stimulus for exciting his own zeal, in the
   first place, before professing to be a leader or teacher to others.
   Although his heart was truly and seriously in the work, he would not
   rest in this, until he had acquired still greater ardor. And if it was
   necessary for David to stir himself up to the praises of God, how
   powerful a stimulant must we require for a more difficult matter when
   we aim at the divine life with self-denial. As to the religious
   exercise here mentioned, let us feel that we will never be sufficiently
   active in it, unless we strenuously exact it from ourselves. As God
   supports and maintains his people in the world with this view, that
   they may employ their whole life in praising him, David very properly
   declares, that he will do this to the end of his course.

   3. Trust not in princes This admonition is appropriately inserted, for
   one means by which men blind themselves is that of involving their
   minds through a number of inventions, and being thus prevented from
   engaging in the praises of God. That God may have the whole praise due
   to him, David exposes and overthrows those false stays on which we
   would otherwise be too much disposed to trust. His meaning is, that we
   should withdraw ourselves from man in general, but he names princes,
   from whom more is to be feared than common men. For what promise could
   poor people hold out, or such as need the help of others? The great and
   wealthy, again, have a dangerous attraction through the splendor
   attaching to them, suggesting to us the step of taking shelter under
   their patronage. As the simple are fascinated by looking to their
   grandeur, he adds, that the most powerful of the world's princes is but
   a son of man This should be enough to rebuke our folly in worshipping
   them as a kind of demigods, as Isaiah says, (Isaiah 31:3,) "The
   Egyptian is man, and not God; flesh, and not spirit." Although princes
   then are furnished with power, money, troops of men, and other
   resources, David reminds us, that it is wrong to place our trust in
   frail mortal man, and vain to seek safety where it cannot be found.

   This he explains more fully in the verse, which follows, where he tells
   us how short and fleeting the life of man is. Though God throw loose
   the reins, and suffer princes even to invade heaven in the wildest
   enterprises, the passing of the spirit, like a breath, suddenly
   overthrows all their counsels and plans. The body being the
   dwelling-place of the soul, what is here said may very well be so
   understood; for at death God recalls the spirit. We may understand it
   more simply, however, of the vital breath; and this will answer better
   with the context -- that as soon as man has ceased to breathe, his
   corpse is subject to putrefaction. It follows, that those who put their
   trust in men, depend upon a fleeting breath. When he says that in that
   day all his thoughts perish, or flow away, perhaps under this
   expression he censures the madness of princes in setting no bounds to
   their hopes and desires, and scaling the very heavens in their
   ambition, like the insane Alexander of Macedon, who, upon hearing that
   there were other worlds, wept that he had not yet conquered one,
   although soon after the funeral urn sufficed him. Observation itself
   proves that the schemes of princes are deep and complicated. That we
   may not fall, therefore, into the error of connecting our hopes with
   them, David says that the life of princes also passes away swiftly and
   in a moment, and that with it all their plans vanish.

   5. Blessed is he, etc. As it would not have been enough to reprove the
   sin, he submits the remedy upon which the proper correction of it
   depends; and this is, that the hopes of men are only stable and
   well-founded when they rest entirely upon God. For even the wicked
   sometimes come the length of acknowledging the folly of trust in man.
   Accordingly they are often angry with themselves for being so
   inconsiderate as to expect deliverance from men; but by neglecting the
   remedy, they are not extricated from their error. The Psalmist having
   condemned the infatuation, which we have seen to be natural to us all,
   wisely subjoins that they are blessed who trust in God. Jeremiah
   observes the same order. (Jeremiah 17:5, 7.)

   "Cursed is he that trusteth in man, and maketh flesh his arm," etc.;

   and then -- "Blessed is the man whose hope the Lord is." When David
   pronounces those blessed whose help is the Lord, he does not restrict
   the happiness of believers to present sense, as if they were only happy
   when God openly and in outward acts appeared as their helper, but he
   places their happiness in this -- that they are truly persuaded of its
   being entirely by the grace of God they stand. He calls him the God of
   Jacob, to distinguish him from the multitude of false gods in which
   unbelievers gloried at that time; and there was good reason for this;
   for while all propose to themselves to seek God, few take the right
   way. In designating the true God by his proper mark, he intimates that
   it is only by an assured faith of adoption that any of us can rest upon
   him; for he must show himself favorable to us before we can look for
   help from him.

   of "his thoughts." He observes, that the original word is literally
   "his glitterings." Parkhurst would render the original word
   "splendours, glories," "which," says he, "makes an excellent sense."

   [286] That is, with the word "Hallelujah," the Hebrew for "Praise
   Jehovah." Hence they have been called, "Hallelujah Psalms."

   Psalm 146:6-10

   6. Who made heaven and earth, the sea, and all things which are in
   them: who keepeth truth for ever. 7. Rendering right to the unjustly
   oppressed, giving bread to the hungry, Jehovah, loosening the bound. 8.
   Jehovah enlightening the blind, [287] Jehovah raising up the bowed
   down, Jehovah loving the righteous. 9. Jehovah guarding the strangers;
   he relieves the fatherless and widow, and will destroy the way of the
   wicked. 10. Jehovah shall reign for ever; thy God, O Zion! from
   generation to generation. Hallelujah.


   6. Who made heaven, etc. By all these epithets he confirms the truth
   previously stated. For though at first sight it may seem inappropriate
   to speak of the Creation, the power of God bears most pertinently upon
   his helping us whenever danger is near. We know how easily Satan tempts
   to distrust, and we are thrown into a state of trembling agitation by
   the slightest causes. Now, if we reflect that God is the Maker of
   heaven and earth, we will reasonably give him the honor of having the
   government of the world which he created in his hands and power. There
   is in this first ascription, then, a commendation of his power, which
   should swallow up all our fears. As it is not enough that God is merely
   able to help us, but as a promise is farther necessary, to the effect
   that he is willing and shall do it, David next declares that he is
   faithful and true, that, on discovering his willingness, no room may be
   left for hesitation.

   7. Rendering right, etc. He instances other kinds both of the power and
   goodness of God, which are just so many reasons why we should hope in
   him. All of them bear upon the point, that the help of God will be
   ready and forthcoming to those who are in the lowest circumstances,
   that accordingly our miseries will be no barrier in the way of his
   helping us; nay, that such is his nature, that he is disposed to assist
   all in proportion to their necessity. He says first, that God renders
   justice to the oppressed, to remind us that although in the judgment of
   sense God connives at the injuries done to us, he will not neglect the
   duty which properly belongs to him of forcing the wicked to give an
   account of their violence. As God, in short, would have the patience of
   his people tried, he here expressly calls upon the afflicted not to
   faint under their troubles, but composedly wait for deliverance from
   one who is slow in interposing, only that he may appear eventually as
   the righteous judge of the world. It follows, that he gives bread to
   the hungry. We learn from this that he is not always so indulgent to
   his own as to load them with abundance, but occasionally withdraws his
   blessing, that he may succor them when reduced to hunger. Had the
   Psalmist said that God fed his people with abundance, and pampered
   them, would not any of those under want or in famine have immediately
   desponded? The goodness of God is therefore properly extended farther
   to the feeding of the hungry. What is added is to the same purpose --
   that he looses them that are bound, and enlightens the blind. As it is
   the fate of his people to be straitened by anxiety, or pressed down by
   human tyranny, or reduced to extremity, in a manner equivalent to being
   shut up in the worst of dungeons, it was necessary to announce, by way
   of comfort, that God can easily find an outgate for us when brought
   into such straits. To enlighten the blind is the same with giving light
   in the midst of darkness. When at any time we know not what to do --
   are in perplexity, and lie confounded and dismayed, as if the darkness
   of death had fallen upon us -- let us learn to ascribe this title to
   God, that he may dissipate the gloom and open our eyes. So when he is
   said to raise up the bowed down, we are taught to take courage when
   weary and groaning under any burden. Nor is it merely that God would
   here have his praises celebrated; he in a manner stretches out his hand
   to the blind, the captives, and the afflicted, that they may cast their
   grief's and cares upon him. There is a reason for repeating the name
   Jehovah three times. In this way he stimulates and excites men to seek
   him who will often rather chafe and pine away in their miseries, than
   betake themselves to this sure asylum. [288] What is added in the close
   of the verse -- that Jehovah loves the righteous, would seem to be a
   qualification of what was formerly said. There are evidently many who,
   though they are grievously afflicted, and groan with anxiety, and lie
   in darkness, experience no comfort from God; and this because in such
   circumstances they provoke God more by their contumacy, and by failing
   for the most part to seek his mercy, reap the just reward of their
   unthankfulness. The Psalmist therefore very properly restricts what he
   had said in general terms of God's helping the afflicted, to the
   righteous -- that those who wish to experience his deliverance, may
   address themselves to him in the sincere exercise of godliness.

   9. Jehovah guarding, etc. By strangers, orphans, and widows, the
   Psalmist means all those in general who are destitute of the help of
   man. While all show favor to those who are known to them and near to
   them, we know that strangers are, for the most part, exposed to
   injurious treatment. We find comparatively few who come forward to
   protect and redress widows and orphans; it seems lost labor, where
   there is no likelihood of compensation. Under these cases the Psalmist
   shows that whatever the grievance may be under which we suffer, the
   reason can only be with ourselves if God, who so kindly invites all who
   are in distress to come to him, does not stretch forth his arm for our
   help. On the other hand, he declares that everything will have an
   adverse and unfortunate issue to those who wickedly despise God. We
   have said upon the first Psalm, that by the way is meant the course of
   life in general. God will destroy the way of the wicked, inasmuch as he
   will curse all their counsels, acts, attempts, and enterprises, so that
   none of them shall have good success. However excellent they may be in
   planning, although they may be crafty and sharp-sighted, and abound in
   strength of resources of every kind, God will overturn all their
   expectations. While he extends his hand to those who are his people,
   and brings them through all obstacles, and even impassable ways, he on
   the contrary destroys the path of the wicked, when apparently most open
   and plain before them.

   10. Jehovah shall reign, etc. He directs his discourse to the Church,
   that he may more effectually persuade all God's people of their really
   finding him to be such as he had just described. When he says that God
   is king for ever, we are to remember at the same time the purpose for
   which he reigns -- taking our definition of it from the preceding
   ascription's. It follows that, whether living or dying, we shall be
   safe under the keeping of a king who reigns expressly for our
   salvation. Had he said no more than that Jehovah reigned for ever, we
   would have been ready to object the distance between us and his
   inconceivable greatness. He states, therefore, in express terms, his
   being bound by sacred covenant to his chosen people.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [287] In our English Bible it is "openeth the eyes of the blind." From
   this clause some of the ancients concluded that the whole of the
   attributes here enumerated are intended to apply to Christ. Bishop
   Horne, and other modern divines, entertain the same opinion. But though
   all that is here said may with the strictest truth be predicated of
   Christ, the propriety of restricting the interpretation of the Psalm to
   him, upon the slender ground specified, may be doubted. Walford
   translates this clause -- "Jehovah delivereth them that are in
   darkness." "There is no word," says he, "in Hebrew to correspond with
   the eyes' of the English Bible; and it is more in agreement with the
   parallelism of the verse, to understand this clause of persons who are
   in distress and adversity, expressed by being in darkness."

   [284] In the original Hebrew and in the Chaldee paraphrase, no author's
   name is prefixed to this Psalm: in the Septuagint, Syriac, Vulgate,
   AEthiopic, and Arabic versions it is ascribed to Haggai and Zechariah.
   Upon the supposition that it was written by these Prophets its
   composition would be after the captivity; "and it may refer," says Dr.
   Adam Clarke, "to the time when Cyrus, prejudiced by the enemies of the
   Jews, withdrew his order for the rebuilding of the walls of Jerusalem,
   to which revocation of the royal edict the Psalm 146:3 may refer, Put
   not your trust in princes,' etc." Horsley, proceeding on the same view,
   entitles it, "A thanksgiving of the returning captives." There is,
   however, nothing in it which prohibits us from looking upon it as a
   Psalm of David.

   PSALM 147

   This Psalm also incites the people of God to praise him upon two
   accounts; first, for the display of his power, goodness, wisdom, and
   other perfections in the common government of the world, and the
   several parts of it, the heavens and the earth, but more particularly
   for his special goodness in cherishing and defending the Church which
   he has chosen of his free grace, in restoring it when fallen down, and
   gathering it when dispersed. [289]
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 147:1-6

   1. Praise ye God; for it is good to sing praises unto our God, for it
   is pleasant, and praise is comely. 2. Jehovah building up Jerusalem,
   will gather the dispersed of Israel: 3. Healing the contrite in heart,
   and binding up their griefs: 4. Numbering the multitude of the stars,
   giving names to each of them. 5. Great is our Lord, and plenteous in
   power, there is no figure for his understanding. 6. Jehovah raiseth up
   the miserable, and casteth the wicked down to the ground.


   Praise ye God, etc. Though the benefits he speaks of are such as God
   extends to all men indiscriminately, it is plain that he addresses more
   especially God's people, who alone behold his works in an enlightened
   manner, whereas stupidity and blindness of mind deprive others of their
   understanding. Nor is his subject confined to the common benefits of
   God, but the main thing which he celebrates is his mercy, as shown to
   his chosen people. That the Church may address itself to the praises of
   God with more alacrity, he states that this kind of exercise is good,
   delightful, and pleasant, by which he indirectly censures a sin which
   is all but universal of becoming wearied at the very mention of God,
   and counting it our highest pleasure to forget both God and ourselves,
   that we may give way to unrestrained indulgence. To teach men to take a
   delight in this religious exercise, the Psalmist reminds them that
   praise is comely, or desirable. For the term n'vh, navah, may be
   rendered either way.

   2. Jehovah building up, etc. He begins with the special mercy of God
   towards his Church and people, in choosing to adopt one nation out of
   all others, and selecting a fixed place where his name might be called
   upon. When he is here called the builder of Jerusalem, the allusion is
   not so much to the outward form and structure, as to the spiritual
   worship of God. It is a common figure in treating of the Church to
   speak of it as a building or temple. The meaning is, that the Church
   was not of human erection, but formed by the supernatural power of God;
   for it was from no dignity of the place itself that Jerusalem became
   the only habitation of God in our world, nor did it come to this honor
   by counsel, industry, effort or power of man, but because God was
   pleased to consecrate it to himself. He employed the labor and
   instrumentality of men indeed in erecting his sanctuary there, but this
   ought never to take from his grace, which alone distinguished the holy
   city from all others. In calling God the former and architect of the
   Church, his object is to make us aware that by his power it remains in
   a firm condition, or is restored when in ruins. Hence he infers that it
   is in his power and arbitrament to gather those who have been
   dispersed. Here the Psalmist would comfort those miserable exiles who
   had been scattered in various quarters, with the hope of being
   recovered from their dispersion, as God had not adopted them without a
   definite purpose into one body. As he had ordered his temple and altar
   to be erected at Jerusalem, and had fixed his seat there, the Psalmist
   would encourage the Jews who were exiles from their native country, to
   entertain good hope of a return, intimating that it was no less
   properly God's work to raise up his Church when ruined and fallen down,
   than to found it at first. It was not, therefore, the Psalmist's object
   directly to celebrate the free mercy of God in the first institution of
   the Church, but to argue from its original, that God would not suffer
   his Church altogether to fall, having once founded it with the design
   of preserving it for ever; for he forsakes not the work of his own
   hands. This comfort ought to be improved by ourselves at the present
   period, when we see the Church on every side so miserably rent asunder,
   leading us to hope that all the elect who have been adjoined to
   Christ's body, will be gathered unto the unity of the faith, although
   now scattered like members torn from one another, and that the
   mutilated body of the Church, which is daily distracted, will be
   restored to its entireness; for God will not suffer his work to fail.

   In the following verse he insists upon the same truth, the figure
   suggesting that though the Church labor under, and be oppressed by many
   diseases, God will speedily and easily recover it from all its wounds.
   The same truth, therefore, is evidently conveyed, under a different
   form of expression -- that the Church, though it may not always be in a
   flourishing condition, is ever safe and secure, and that God will
   miraculously heal it, as though it were a diseased body.

   4. Numbering the multitude, etc. As the gathering together of the
   people of whom the Psalmist spoke might appear to be an impossibility,
   there seems some ground for the opinion of those who think that he
   confirms it in this verse. The connection they give to the Psalmist's
   words is this -- that as it is at least not more difficult to gather
   men together who are outcast and scattered, than to number the stars,
   there was no reason why the wandering exile Israelites should despair
   of their return, provided they should resort with one consent to God as
   their only head. There is some probability, too, in the conjecture that
   the Psalmist may allude to that promise --

   "Look now towards the stars of heaven, if thou canst tell them,
   so shall thy seed be." (Genesis 15:5.)

   But as the Psalmist immediately afterwards treats of the order of
   things in nature generally, the simplest rendering, I think, is to
   understand this verse with reference to the admirable work of God to be
   seen in the heavens, where we behold his matchless wisdom, in
   regulating, without one degree of aberration, the manifold, complex,
   winding courses of the stars. To each of them he assigns its fixed and
   distinct office, and in all the multitude there is no confusion. He
   therefore exclaims immediately -- Great is God, and boundless, both in
   power and understanding. We learn from this that there cannot be
   greater folly than to make our judgment the measure of God's works,
   displaying in these, as he often does, his incomprehensible power and
   wisdom.

   6. Raising up, etc. The ascription of this to God fitly tends to
   confirm our hope under affliction, and prevent our souls from fainting
   under the cross. From this we may infer that although our fathers who
   lived under the Law were more gently dealt with, they knew something at
   least of that warfare with which God daily exercises us, in order to
   make us seek our true rest elsewhere than in this world. Should a doubt
   steal upon the minds of those who have been brought under heavy
   afflictions, as to the forthcoming of that help which God has promised
   to extend, let the truth recur to our remembrance, that we are brought
   low that God may lift us up again. And if upon seeing the prosperity of
   the wicked we are smitten and inflamed with envy, let the words of the
   Psalmist come into our mind, That they are lifted up that they may be
   cast down into destruction. When he speaks of their being cast down
   even to the earth, there can be no doubt that he passes an indirect
   censure upon their pride which leads them to exalt themselves on high,
   as if they belonged to some superior order of beings.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 147:7-11

   7. Sing to Jehovah in thanksgiving, sing psalms to our God upon the
   harp. [290] 8. Who covereth the heavens with clouds, prepareth rain for
   the earth, maketh grass to germinate on the mountains. [291] 9. Who
   giveth to the cattle their food, to the young ones of the ravens which
   cry to him. 10. Not in the strength of the horse will he take pleasure,
   nor in the legs of man will he delight. 11. Jehovah delighteth in those
   who fear him, who hope in his mercy.


   7. Sing to Jehovah in thanksgiving Again he exhorts to sing the praises
   of God, intimating at the same time that abundant matter was not
   wanting, since new proofs still meet our eyes of his power, goodness,
   and wisdom. First he tells us that he covers the heavens with clouds,
   and this change would awaken our attention, were we not chargeable with
   so much thoughtlessness. Various as are the marvels to be seen in the
   heavens above us, were the same serenity always to continue, we would
   not have so wonderful a display of his power as when he suddenly veils
   them with clouds, withdrawing the light of the sun, and setting a new
   face as it were upon the world. He afterwards hints that in this way
   provision is made for all living creatures, for thus the herbs
   germinate, and the earth is supplied with the moisture which makes it
   fertile. Thus in connection with the proofs of his power God sets
   before our eyes those of his mercy and fatherly consideration for the
   human family; nay, he shows that he does not overlook even the wild
   beasts and cattle. Philosophers discover the origin of rain in the
   elements, and it is not denied that clouds are formed from the gross
   vapors which are exhaled from the earth and sea, but second causes
   should not prevent us from recognizing the providence of God in
   furnishing the earth with the moisture needed for fructification. As
   the earth chapped with heat shows its thirst by opening its mouth, so
   God on his part in sending rain distills drink for it. He might in
   other ways of a more secret kind give it strength to preserve it from
   failing, but this irrigation is something which passes before our eyes
   to image forth the continual care which he has over us.

   9. Who gives to the cattle their food By giving an instance he explains
   more clearly what he had said, of God's providing food for every living
   creature. When he speaks of the cattle and the ravens being fed, and
   not of men, this is to give more emphasis to his argument. We know that
   it was for man's sake the world was made at all, and endued with
   fertility and plenty; and in proportion as we are nearer in the scale
   of existence to God, he shows us the more of his goodness. But if he
   condescends to notice the brute creation, it is plain that to us he
   will be a nurse and a father. For the same reason he names the ravens,
   the most contemptible of all birds, to teach us that the goodness of
   God extends to every part of the world. When he says that their young
   cry unto God, he no doubt refers to their natural cry, but hints at the
   same time that they own that they must be in want unless God give them
   meat from heaven. As to the Jewish fable that the ravens desert their
   young ones as soon as put forth, and that worms are bred in the barks
   of the trees to feed them, this is one of their customary stories,
   never scrupling as they do, nor being ashamed, to invent anything,
   however unfounded, when a difficulty comes in the way. [292] It is
   enough for us to know that the whole system of nature is so regulated
   by God, that not even the young ravens want their food, when with
   hoarse outcry they confess that they are in need, and that they cannot
   have it supplied except by God.

   10. Not in the strength of the horse, etc. After the Psalmist has shown
   that there is proof of the divine goodness in every part of the world,
   he takes particular notice that men have no strength but what is given
   them from above, and this he adds with the express purpose of checking
   the pride by which almost all men are inflamed, and which leads them to
   trust in their own strength. The meaning of the passage is, that let
   man come in the preparation of his own strength, and with all the
   assistance's that seem to him most prevalent, this will only issue in
   smoke and vanity; nay, that in arrogating the very least to himself,
   this will only be a hindrance in the way of the mercy of God, by which
   alone we stand. The strength of the horse is mentioned by synecdoche to
   denote any kind of protection. Not that God is displeased with those
   things in themselves considered which he has given us as helps, but it
   is necessary that we be withdrawn from a false confidence in them, for
   very commonly when any resource is at hand, we are foolishly
   intoxicated and lifted up with pride. He opposes the fear of God
   therefore to the strength both of men and of horses, and places his
   hope in his mercy, intimating that it is highly incumbent upon us to
   show our moderation in worshipping God with reverence and holiness, and
   depending upon his grace. Hence we learn that he only condemns that
   strength which would take from God the honor due to him.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [290] The Hebrew word here is knvr, kinnor. It is uniformly translated
   "harp" by Calvin, and also by the translators of our English Bible. But
   as is supposed by Calmet and others, it more probably corresponded with
   the lyre of Egypt, Greece, and Rome. In the Septuagint it is usually
   either thrown into the Greek form kinura, cinyra, or rendered kithara,
   cithara, one of the various names by which the principal varieties of
   the ancient lyres were distinguished. And where these are not the words
   by which it is rendered in that version, it is rendered by other names
   which the Greeks gave to different forms of the lyre. From this it is
   evident that the translators of the Greek version believed that knvr
   kinnor, denoted the lyre, although from their translating it by
   different words, each signifying a particular variety of that
   instrument, they were uncertain as to the particular species of lyre.
   "The brief intimations in Scripture are in full accordance with this
   statement; for it is not described as such an instrument -- large,
   heavy, and resting on the ground when played -- as the word harp'
   suggests to our minds; but as a light portable instrument, which the
   player carried in his hand or on his arm, and might walk or dance the
   while. In fact, Scripture describes the kinnor as being used in such a
   manner and on such occasions as we know the lyre to have been by the
   ancients, who indeed had not, so far as we know, any harps large and
   resting on the ground like ours. We speak only of the Greeks and
   Romans, however, for the Egyptians had large standing harps; from which
   we shall in a future note take occasion to conclude that such were also
   known to the Hebrews, while we retain our impression that the lyre is
   denoted by the kinnor." -- Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible. The
   kinnor is an instrument of the highest antiquity, being one of those
   two invented by Jubal before the flood. Genesis 4:21. It was used at an
   early period on festal occasions, as appears from the next instance in
   which it is mentioned in Scripture, six hundred years after the deluge,
   namely, in Laban's words to Jacob, as recorded in Genesis 31:27. It was
   also used by the prophets in their sacred music, as we learn from the
   next instance in which it is noticed -- in the time of Samuel, 1 Samuel
   10:5. The notes of the kinnor might be mournful, (Isaiah 16:11;) but
   they were also cheerful, (Job 21:2; Job 30:31; 1 Samuel 16:23; Psalm
   137:2.) This musical instrument was constructed of wood, 1 Kings 10:12;
   and it no doubt was to be found among the Hebrews of different forms
   and power, and varying in the number of strings. The ancient lyres were
   either played with the fingers, or struck with a plectrum, an
   instrument which appears generally to have consisted of a piece of
   ivory, polished wood, or metal, in the form of a quill.

   [291] "After this clause the Vulgate, the Septuagint, AEthiopic,
   Arabic, and Anglo-Saxon add, and herb for the service of man.' It
   appears that a hemistich or half line has been lost from the Hebrew
   text, which, according to the above version, must have stood as in
   Psalm 104:14." -- Dr. Adam Clarke.

   Psalm 147:12-14

   12. Celebrate Jehovah, O Jerusalem! praise thy God, O Zion! 13. For he
   strengthens the bars of thy gates, he blesses thy children in the midst
   of thee. 14. Who maketh thy borders peace; with the fatness of the corn
   he satifieth thee.


   12. Celebrate Jehovah, O Jerusalem! Having spoken in general of the
   mercies of God, he again addresses his discourse to the Lord's people,
   who alone, as we have remarked already, can appreciate them, calling
   upon them to recognize with thanksgiving the blessings which others
   riot upon without acknowledgment. Under the name of Jerusalem, he
   comprises the whole Church, for in that place the faithful then held
   their religious assemblies, and flowed together as it were to the
   standard of the Lord. Although he will take occasion afterwards again
   to speak of the government of the world at large, he here commemorates
   the goodness of God as manifested to his own people, in protecting his
   own Church, bountifully cherishing it, enriching it abundantly with all
   blessings, and preserving it in peace and safety from all harm. When he
   says that the bars of the gates are strengthened by God, he means that
   the holy city was perfectly guarded by him from all fear of hostile
   attack. To the same effect is the other expression which comes after --
   that all its bounds were made peace Enemies were under divine restraint
   so as to cause no disturbance or confusions. Not that the Church is
   always in a state of peace throughout its whole extent, and exempt from
   attack, but that God in a visible manner stretches forth his hand to
   repel these assaults, and it can securely survey the whole array of its
   enemies. A more extensive meaning indeed may be given to the term
   peace, which is often taken to signify a happy and prosperous
   condition. But as mention is made of bounds, the former sense seems
   most appropriate. The blessing of God enjoyed within is next spoken of,
   consisting in this, that the citizens dwell prosperously and happily in
   it, and are fed bountifully, even to satiety; which does not mean that
   the children of God always wallow in abundance. This might be the means
   of corrupting them, prone as our nature is to wantonness; but it
   suggests that they recognize the liberality of God in their daily food
   more clearly than others who want faith, and whom either abundance
   renders blind, or poverty vexes with deplorable anxiety, or
   covetousness inflames with a desire that never can be satisfied. God's
   paternal favor was shown more particularly to our fathers under the law
   in the abundance of temporal provision, it being necessary to lead them
   forward to something higher by what was elementary.

   Psalm 147:15-20

   15. While he sends forth his word to the earth, his word runneth very
   swiftly. 16. Who giveth snow like wool, [293] and scattereth the hoar
   frost as ashes. 17. He casteth forth his ice like morsels: [294] before
   his cold who can stand? [295] 18. He shall send his word, and shall
   melt them: his breath shall blow, the waters shall flow. 19. He
   announces his words to Jacob, his edicts and his judgments to Israel.
   20. He hath not done so to every nation, and his judgments he hath not
   showed them. Hallelujah.


   15. While he sends forth, etc. He again touches upon some instances of
   the operation of God, everywhere to be seen in the system of nature.
   And as the changes which take place in the air, and upon the earth, and
   which should be considered evidences of his power, may perhaps be
   regarded by the world as the effect of chance, the Psalmist, before
   proceeding to speak of the snow, hoar frost, and ice, expressly
   declares, that earth is governed by his power and control. The sending
   forth of his word is nothing else than the secret influence by which he
   regulates and governs all things, for without his orders and
   appointment no movement could take place among the elements, nor could
   they be borne, now one way and now another, upon their own spontaneous
   impulse without his foregoing secret decree. He says, that his word
   runneth quickly, because, when once God has intimated his will, all
   things concur to carry it into effect. If we do not hold fast by this
   principle, however acutely we may investigate second causes, all our
   perspicacity will come to nothing. It is thus that Aristotle, for
   example, has shown such ingenuity upon the subject of meteors, that he
   discusses their natural causes most exactly, while he omits the main
   point of all, upon which the merest child, at least having any
   religion, has the superiority over him. He must have little discernment
   who, in the sudden snows and hoar-frosts, does not perceive how quickly
   the word of God runs. If, then, we would avoid a senseless natural
   philosophy, we must always start with this principle, that everything
   in nature depends upon the will of God, and that the whole course of
   nature is only the prompt carrying into effect of his orders. When the
   waters congeal, when the hail spreads through the air, and hoar frosts
   darken the sky, surely we have proof how effectual his word is. But if
   all these wonders produce no effect upon most men, at least the
   piercing cold which benumbs our bodies, should force us to recognize
   the power of God. When the heat of the sun scorches us in summer, and
   again, upon the succession of winter, all things are bound up, such a
   change as this, which must have appeared incredible had we not been
   accustomed to it, cries out loudly that there is a being who reigns
   above.

   19. He announces his words to Jacob, etc. Here it is another word that
   is spoken of than what was formerly mentioned; for God speaks in a
   different way to the insensate works of his hands, which he silently
   subordinates to his will by secret laws impressed upon them, than he
   does to men who are endued with understanding, for these he teaches
   with articulate language, that they may obey him intelligently and with
   consent. Although the blessings formerly mentioned are not to be
   depreciated, they fall far short of this, that he has condescended to
   be the teacher of his chosen people, by communicating to them that
   religious doctrine which is a treasure of everlasting salvation. How
   little would it avail the Church that it were filled with the perishing
   enjoyments of time, and protected from hostile violence, did not its
   hope extend beyond this world. This, accordingly, is the grand proof of
   his love, that he has set before us in his word the light of eternal
   life. On this account it is appropriately mentioned here as the
   crowning part of true solid happiness. And let us learn from this, that
   we should not only receive the doctrine of God with reverential and
   holy obedience, but embrace it with affection, for we can conceive of
   nothing more delightful and desirable than that God should undertake
   our salvation, and give testimony of this by stretching out his hand to
   bring us to himself. For this is the design with which the doctrine has
   been given to us, that amidst the thick darkness of this world, and the
   devious errors into which Satan misleads the children of men, the great
   Father of us all may by it cast a foregoing light upon our path before
   gathering us to the inheritance of heaven. We are to notice, that the
   part which was sustained by Moses and the Prophets according to divine
   appointment is here ascribed to God himself, for we only put due honor
   upon the doctrine of religion, and estimate it at its proper worth when
   we rise to the consideration of God, who, in using the instrumentality
   of men, still claims to be considered our chief and only teacher. Thus
   its due majesty is assigned to the word from the person of its author.
   Again, he enhances the mercy shown by stating a comparison, intimating
   that this had not been done for other nations For if it be asked why
   God preferred one people to others, this pre-eminence will certainly
   lead us to gratuitous election as its source, since we will find that
   the children of Israel did not differ from others in any excellency
   attaching to themselves, but because God passed by others and
   condescended to adopt them into his favor.

   [293] We learn from Chardin in a manuscript note on this passage, as
   quoted by Harmer in his Observations, that towards the Black Sea, in
   Iberia and Armenia, and therefore he imagines in other countries also,
   "the snow falls in flakes as big as walnuts; but not being either hard
   or very compact, it does no other harm than presently to cover and
   overwhelm the traveller." The inspired writer had probably seen flakes
   of equal size on the mountains of Judea; and this would suggest to his
   mind the strikingly appropriate figure, "He giveth his snow like wool."

   [294] Walford translates, "He casteth down his ice in hail-stones."
   "The expression, like morsels,'" says he, "is a literal version of the
   Hebrew, but it gives so imperfect and obscure a representation of the
   meaning, as to induce the substitution which is here found. There can
   be no doubt but that hail is the thing intended: in this the critics
   are unanimous. It is most likely that the Hebrew term, which is
   translated morsels,' means small pieces of some substance, which we
   cannot now determine."

   [295] "The cold is sometimes extremely severe and even mortal in
   Palestine and the neighboring countries. Fulchirius Carnotensis, as
   cited by Mr. Harmer, saw the cold prove deadly to many. Jacobus de
   Vitriaco informs us, that the same thing happened to many of the poorer
   people, engaged in an expedition in which he himself was concerned,
   against Mount Tabor: they had suffered severely the preceding days by
   cold; but on the 24th of December it was so sharp that many of the poor
   people, and of the beasts of burden, actually died. Albertus Acquensis
   tells us the same thing happened to thirty of the people that attended
   King Baldwin I., in the mountainous districts of Arabia by the Dead
   Sea, where they had to conflict with horrible hail, with ice, and
   unheard of snow and rain.' These citations, as Harmer appositely
   remarks, may remove our wonder at such passages as that here commented
   on, in a hymn composed in those warmer climates." -- Mant.

   [289] In the Hebrew text, and in the Chaldee and Vulgate versions, this
   Psalm is without a title, but in the Septuagint it is assigned to the
   days of Haggai and Zephaniah, the title being -- Allelouia Angaiou kai
   Zachariou; and this may be regarded as a probable reference. In Psalm
   147:2 and Psalm 147:13 there seems to be an allusion to the rebuilding
   of Jerusalem. Bishop Horsley entitles it -- "Thanksgiving of the
   returned captives. Perhaps composed for a Pentecost or Feast of
   Trumpets, after the Restoration." "Eben Ezra, and other Jewish writers,
   think that it foretells the future rebuilding of Jerusalem, and the
   restoration of the Jews from their present captivity, and refer it to
   the times of Messiah." -- Dr. Gill.

   PSALM 148

   The more effectually to express how worthy God is to be praised in his
   works, he calls upon all creatures from above and below to sing his
   praises. He begins with angels, but immediately proceeds to address the
   brute creation and dumb elements, intimating, that there is no part of
   the world in which the praises of God are not to be heard, inasmuch as
   he everywhere gives proof of his power, goodness, and wisdom. He then
   comes to speak of men, whom God has constituted the proper heralds of
   his praises in this world. But as the unbelieving portion of them is
   both blind to the consideration of God's works, and dumb to his
   praises, the Psalmist at the close appeals to the children of Israel,
   who were privileged with a special discovery of God, as principal
   witnesses. [296]

   Hallelujah.

   Psalm 148:1-6

   1. Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens, praise him in the heights. 2.
   Praise him, all ye his angels; praise him, all ye his armies. 3. Praise
   him, ye sun and moon; praise him, ye shining stars. 4. Praise him, ye
   heavens of heavens, and ye waters above the heavens. 5. Let them praise
   the name of Jehovah; for he commanded, and they were created. 6. And he
   established them for ever; he hath set for them a decree for ever, and
   it shall not pass beyond.


   1. Praise Jehovah from the heavens He seems here to include the stars
   as well as the angels, and, therefore, heaven itself, the air, and all
   that is gendered in it; for afterwards a division is made when he first
   calls upon angels, then upon the stars, and the waters of the
   firmament. With regard to the angels, created as they were for this
   very end -- that they might be instant in this religious service, we
   need not wonder that they should be placed first in order when the
   praises of God are spoken of. Accordingly, in that remarkable vision
   which Isaiah describes, (Isaiah 6:3,) the cherubim cry out -- "Holy,
   holy, holy, Lord God of Hosts." And in several other places of
   Scripture the angels are represented as praising God by such
   ascription's. How, then, can zeal like theirs stand in need of
   exhortations? Or, if they require to be incited, what can be more
   unseemly than that we, who are so sluggish in the service, should
   assume the part of exhorting them to their duty? David, then, who did
   not equal the angels in zeal, but came far behind them, was not
   qualified to be an exhorter to them. But neither did this enter into
   his purpose; he would simply testify that it was the height of his
   happiness and desire to join in sacred concert with elect angels in
   praising God. And there is nothing unreasonable that, in order to stir
   himself up in the praises of God, he should call as companions upon the
   angels, although these run spontaneously in the service, and are fitter
   to lead the way. He calls them, in the second part of the verse -- the
   armies of God; for they stand always ready to receive his orders. "Ten
   thousand times ten thousand surround his throne," as Daniel says,
   (Daniel 7:10.) The same name is applied also to the stars, both because
   they are remarkable for the order which maintains among them, and
   because they execute with inconceivable quickness the orders of God.
   But the angels are here called armies, upon the same account as
   elsewhere principalities and powers, inasmuch as God exerts his power
   by their hands.

   3. Praise him, ye sun and moon This passage gives no countenance to the
   dream of Plato, that the stars excel in sense and intelligence. Nor
   does the Psalmist give them the same place as he had just assigned to
   angels, but merely intimates that the glory of God is everywhere to be
   seen, as if they sang his praises with an audible voice. And here he
   tacitly reproves the ingratitude of man; for all would hear this
   symphony, were they at all attent upon considering the works of God.
   For doth not the sun by his light, and heat, and other marvelous
   effects, praise his Maker? The stars when they run their course, and at
   once adorn the heavens and give light to the earth, do they not sound
   the praises of God? but as we are deaf and insensible, the Psalmist
   calls upon them as witnesses to reprove our indolence. By the heavens
   of heavens he no doubt means the spheres. Eclipses, and other things
   which we observe, plainly show both that the fixed stars are above the
   planets, and that the planets themselves are placed in different
   orbits. [297] The excellency of this contrivance the Psalmist justly
   commends, speaking expressly of the heavens of heavens; not as if there
   were really more heavens than one, but to extol the matchless wisdom
   which God has shown in creating the heavens; for the sun, moon, and
   stars are not confusedly mixed together, but each has its own position
   and station assigned to it, and their manifold courses are all
   regulated. As under the name of the heavens he comprehends the air, or
   at least all the space from the middle region of the air upwards, he
   calls rains, the waters above the heavens There is no foundation for
   the conjecture which some have made, that there are waters deposited
   above the four elements; and when the Psalmist speaks of these waters
   as being above, he clearly points at the descent of the rain. It is
   adhering too strictly to the letter of the words employed, to conceive
   as if there were some sea up in the heavens, where the waters were
   permanently deposited; for we know that Moses and the Prophets
   ordinarily speak in a popular style, suited to the lowest apprehension.
   It would be absurd, then, to seek to reduce what they say to the rules
   of philosophy; as, for example, in the passage before us, the Psalmist
   notes the marvelous fact that God holds the waters suspended in the
   air, because it seems contrary to nature that they should mount aloft,
   and also, that though fluid they should hang in vacant space.
   Accordingly it is said elsewhere, that they are held there as enclosed
   in bottles. (Psalm 33:7.) The Psalmist has borrowed the form of
   expression from Moses, who says -- "that the waters were divided from
   the waters." (Genesis 1:6.)

   5. Let them praise the name, etc. As he speaks of things wanting
   intelligence, he passes to the third person, from which we infer that
   his reason for having spoken in the second person hitherto, was to make
   a deeper impression upon men. And he asks no other praise than that
   which may teach us that the stars did not make themselves, nor the
   rains spring from chance; for notwithstanding the signal proofs we
   constantly have before our eyes of the divine power, we with shameful
   carelessness overlook the great author. He says emphatically -- for He
   Himself created, intimating that the world is not eternal, as wicked
   men conjecture, nor made by a concourse of atoms, but that this fair
   order of things which we see, suddenly sprang forth upon the
   commandment of God. And, speaking of the creation, he adds what is even
   more worthy of observation, that he gave that law to them which remains
   inviolable. For many, while they grant that the world was made by God,
   lapse from this into the senseless notion that now the order of nature
   stands of itself, and that God sits idle in the heavens. The Psalmist
   very properly insists, therefore, that the works of God above us in the
   heavens were not only made by him, but even now move forward at his
   disposal; and that not only was a secret power communicated to them at
   first, but while they go through their assigned parts, their operation
   and ministry to their various ends is dependent upon God.

   Psalm 148:7-10

   7. Praise Jehovah! ye creatures from the earth, [298] dragons, [299]
   and all deeps. 8. Fire and hail, snow and ice, breath of the storm
   doing his word. 9. Mountains, and all hills; fruitful tree, and all
   cedars. 10. Wild beasts, and all cattle; reptile, and winged fowl.


   7. Praise Jehovah, etc. He now comes to the lower parts of the world;
   although deviating at the same time from the exact order, he mixes up
   such things as are produced in the air -- lightning's, snow, ice, and
   storms. These should rather have been placed among the former class,
   but he has respect to the common apprehension of men. The scope of the
   whole is, that wherever we turn our eyes we meet with evidences of the
   power of God. He speaks first of the whales; for, as he mentions the
   abysses or deeps immediately afterwards, I have no doubt that by
   tnynym, tanninim, he means fishes of the sea, such as whales. It is
   only reasonable to think that matter for praising God should be taken
   from the sea, which is fraught with so many wonders. He then ascends to
   hail, snows, and storms, which he says fulfill the word of God; for it
   is not by an effect of chance that the heavens are clouded, or that a
   single drop of rain falls from the clouds, or that the thunders rage,
   but one and all of these changes depend upon the secret will of God,
   whether he will show his goodness to the children of men in irrigating
   the earth, or punish their sins by tempest, hail, or other calamities.
   The passage contains instruction of various kinds, as, for example,
   that when dearth impends, however parched the earth may be by long
   continued heat, God can promptly send rain which will remove the
   drought at his pleasure. If from incessant rains, on the other hand,
   the seed rot in the ground, or the crops do not come to maturity, we
   should pray for fair weather. If we are alarmed by thunder, we are
   taught to pray to God, for as it is he who sends it in his anger, so he
   can still all the troubled elements. And we are not to take up the
   narrow view of this truth which irreligious men advocate, that things
   in nature merely move according to the laws impressed upon them from
   the beginning, while God stands by idle, but are to hold firmly that
   God watches over his creatures, and that nothing can take place without
   his present disposal, as we have seen, Psalm 104:4 that

   "he maketh the winds his messengers,
   and his ministers a flaming fire."

   Psalm 148:11-14

   11. Kings of the earth, and all peoples; princes, and all judges of the
   earth. 12. Young men, and also virgins; old men, with children. 13. Let
   them praise the name of Jehovah: for exalted is his name only, his
   praise is above the earth and the heavens. 14. And he hath exalted the
   horn of his people: praise is to all his merciful ones, to the children
   of Israel, a people which is near to him. Hallelujah.


   11. Kings of the earth, etc. He now turns his address to men, with a
   respect to whom it was that he called for a declaration of God's
   praises from creatures, both above and from beneath. As kings and
   princes are blinded by the dazzling influence of their station, so as
   to think the world was made for them, and to despise God in the pride
   of their hearts, he particularly calls them to this duty; and, by
   mentioning them first, he reproves their ingratitude in withholding
   their tribute of praise when they are under greater obligations than
   others. As all men originally stand upon a level as to condition, the
   higher persons have risen, and the nearer they have been brought to
   God, the more sacredly are they bound to proclaim his goodness. The
   more intolerable is the wickedness of kings and princes who claim
   exemption from the common rule, when they ought rather to inculcate it
   upon others and lead the way. He could have addressed his exhortation
   at once summarily to all men, as indeed he mentions peoples in general
   terms; but by thrice specifying princes he suggests that they are slow
   to discharge the duty, and need to be urged do it. Then follows a
   division according to age and sex, to show that all without exception
   are created for this end, and should unitedly devote their energies to
   it. As to old men, the more God has lengthened out their lives the more
   should they be exercised in singing his praises; but he joins young men
   with them, for though they have less experience from continued habit,
   it will be inexcusable if they do not acknowledge the great mercy of
   God in the vigor of their lives. In speaking of girls or virgins, the
   particle gm, gam, also, is not merely expletive, but added to make the
   words more emphatical, conveying the truth that even the young women
   who are not so liberally educated as the male sex, being considered as
   born for domestic offices, will omit their duty if they do not join
   with the rest of the Church in praising God. It follows that all from
   the least to the greatest are bound by this common rule.

   14. And hath exalted the horn, etc. As we saw in the former Psalm, that
   the perfections of God are to be seen more conspicuously in the Church
   than in the constitution of the world at large, the Psalmist has added
   this sentence, as to the Church being protected by the divine hand, and
   armed with a power against all enemies which secures its safety in
   every danger. By the horn, as is well known, is meant strength or
   dignity. Accordingly the Psalmist means that God's blessing is apparent
   in his Church and among his chosen people, inasmuch as it only
   flourishes and is powerful through his strength. There is a tacit
   comparison implied between the Church of God and other hostile powers,
   for it needs divine guardianship as being exposed on all sides to
   attack. Hence the Psalmist infers that praise is to all the merciful
   ones of God, for they have ground given them in the singular goodness
   of his condescension both for self-congratulation and praise. In
   calling the children of Israel a people near unto God, he reminds them
   of the gracious covenant which God made with Abraham. For how came the
   nearness, except in the way of God's preferring an unknown despised
   stranger to all nations? Nor are we to seek the cause of the
   distinction elsewhere than in the mere love of God. Though all the
   world equally belongs to God, he graciously discovered himself to the
   children of Israel, and brought them near to him, strangers as they
   were from God, even as are the whole race of Adam. Hence the words of
   Moses --

   "When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, and
   distributed the peoples, he stretched forth his line to Jacob."
   (Deuteronomy 32:8.)

   He is to be considered, therefore, as pointing out the cause why God
   hath extended such signal blessings to a single people, and a people
   poor and despised -- his adoption of them to himself.

   PSALM 149

   If we may be allowed to compare this Psalm with the former ones, and
   the next, which is the last, the only difference is, that while the
   author of the Psalm, whoever he was, has hitherto spoken of God's
   special care and protection of his Church in connection with the common
   providential government of the world, here he speaks of his benefits to
   the Church exclusively. In the next Psalm mention is only made of the
   power of God in general.

   Hallelujah.

   Psalm 149:1-4

   1. Sing ye to Jehovah a new song: his praise is in the congregation of
   the merciful. 2. Let Israel rejoice in his Maker: let the sons of Zion
   rejoice their king. [300] 3. Let them praise his name on the pipe,
   [301] on the timbrel [302] and the harp let them sing psalms to him. 4.
   Because Jehovah hath taken pleasure in his people; he will glorify the
   poor unto salvation.


   1. Sing to Jehovah a new song. This exordium proves what I have just
   said, that the exhortation now given is addressed only to God's people;
   for the singular goodness which is particularly extended to them
   affords more ample matter of praise. The probable conjecture is, that
   the Psalm was composed at the time when the people were begun to
   rejoice, or after they had returned to their native country from the
   Babylonish captivity. We will see from the context that a promise is
   given of recovery from their ruined condition. The object, I think, of
   the Psalmist, is to encourage them to expect the full and complete
   deliverance, some prelude of which had been suddenly and unexpectedly
   given in the permission to return. As the Church was not fully restored
   at once, but was with difficulty and only after a long period brought
   to a state of vigor, comfort such as this was much needed. The Spirit
   of God would also furnish a remedy for evils which were afterwards to
   break out; for the Church had scarcely begun to respire when it was
   again harassed with various evils, and oppressed by the cruel tyranny
   of Antiochus, which was followed up by a dreadful dispersion. The
   Psalmist had good reason therefore for animating the godly to look
   forward for the full accomplishment of the mercy of God, that they
   might be persuaded of divine protection until such time as the Messiah
   should arise who would gather all Israel. He calls this a new song, as
   we have noticed elsewhere, to distinguish it from those with which the
   saints commonly and daily praised God, for praise is their continued
   exercise. It follows that he speaks of some rare and unusual benefit,
   demanding signal and particular thanksgiving. And I am disposed to
   think that whoever may have been the author of the Psalm, he alludes to
   that passage in Isaiah, (Isaiah 42:10,) "Sing unto the Lord a new
   song," when he speaks of the future restoration of the Church, and the
   eternal kingdom of Christ. In the second clause of the verse there is a
   promise implied. For though he proceeds to exhort the Lord's people to
   sing God's praises together, he hints along with this that the Church
   would coalesce again into one body, so as to celebrate God's praises in
   the solemn assembly. We know that so scattered were the Israelites,
   that the sacred songs ceased to be sung, as elsewhere they complain of
   being called upon to sing --

   "How shall we sing the songs of the Lord in a strange land?" (Psalm
   137:4.)

   He bids them prepare therefore after this sad dispersion for holding
   their sacred assemblies again.

   2. Let Israel rejoice in his Maker. He insists upon the same point,
   that the Lord's people should rest firmly persuaded that their family
   had not been chosen out in vain from the rest of the world, but that
   God would be mindful of his covenant, and not allow the mercies which
   he had extended to them to fail or become extinct. Although they had
   been temporarily deprived of the inheritance of the land of Canaan,
   which was the pledge of their adoption, the Psalmist calls God their
   Maker, and king of the sons of Zion, to remind them that when adopted
   to a pre-eminency above other nations, this was a species of new
   creation. So in Psalm 45:6, the Israelites are called "the work of
   God's hands," not merely because they were like other men created by
   him, but because he had formed them anew, and distinguished them with a
   new honor, that, of being separated front the whole human race. The
   name king has a wider signification, intimating that as this people was
   at first formed by God, so it was with the view of their being ever
   governed by his power. The musical instruments he mentions were
   peculiar to this infancy of the Church, nor should we foolishly imitate
   a practice which was intended only for God's ancient people. But the
   Psalmist confirms what has been already mentioned, that their religious
   assemblies which had been for a time interrupted would soon be
   restored, and they would call upon the name of the Lord in the due
   order of his worship.

   4. For God hath taken pleasure in his people. We have spoken elsewhere
   of the verb rtsh, ratsah here it means free favor, the Psalmist saying
   that it was entirely of his good pleasure that God had chosen this
   people to himself. From this source flows what is added in the second
   clause, that God would give a new glory of deliverance to the
   afflicted. In the Hebrew nvym, anavim, means poor and afflicted ones,
   but the term came afterwards to be applied to merciful persons, as
   bodily afflictions have a tendency to subdue pride, while abundance
   begets cruelty. The Psalmist accordingly mitigates the sadness of
   present evils by administering seasonable consolation, that God's
   people, when oppressed by troubles, might look forward with hope to the
   glorious deliverance which was yet unseen. The sum of the passage is --
   that God, who had fixed his love upon his chosen people, could not
   possibly abandon them to such miseries as they now suffered under.

   is often in our authorized version rendered "dance"; but this is not
   its meaning. It denotes, as Parkhurst states, "some fistular wind
   instrument of music, with holes, as a flute, pipe or fife, from chl,
   chal to make a hole or opening." "I know no place in the Bible." Says
   Dr. Adam Clark, "where mchvl, mechol, and mchlt, mechalath, mean dance
   of any kind; they constantly mean some kind of pipe."

   [302] The Hebrew name for this kind of this musical instrument is tph,
   toph. The timbrel, tympanum, or tambourine, was used chiefly by women,
   and was employed in choral dances, or occasions of religious or festal
   processions. Thus we read in Exodus 15:20, 21, "And Miriam the
   prophetess, the sister of Aaron, took a timbrel in her hand; and all
   the women went out after her with timbrels and dances. And Miriam
   answered them, Sing ye to the Lord, for he hath triumphed gloriously;
   the horse and his rider hath he thrown into the sea." The principle of
   the phph, toph, or timbrel was that of a prepared skin stretched upon a
   hoop or frame. There were various kinds or forms of this instrument.
   "Our common tambourine, with small cymbals inserted in the frame, also
   appears in some paintings, [of Egyptian and European antiquity,] and is
   now very common in Western Asia. We are told that the frame was either
   of metal or wood and that the ass's skin was usually employed for the
   covering. They were not always played by the naked hand; but were
   sometimes struck with small batons, or with a knotty whip with many
   thongs, instead of which, on particular festivals, a sprig of some tree
   or plant, considered suitable to the occasion, was sometimes employed."
   -- Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible. The timbrel is evidently of
   oriental origin. From the reference to it in Genesis 31:27, where tph
   is translated "tabret," we learn that it was known in the time of
   Jacob, that is, ages previous to the existence of the great European
   nations of antiquity; and both the Greeks and Romans confessed that
   their instruments of this class were derived from Egyptians and
   Syrians. See [4]volume 3

   Psalm 149:5-9

   5. The merciful shall rejoice in glory; they shall shout for joy upon
   their couches. [303] 6. The high praises of God are in their throat
   [304] and a two-edged sword is in their hand: 7. To execute vengeance
   upon the nations, castigations upon the peoples: 8. To bind their kings
   with chains, and their nobles with iron fetters: 9. To execute upon
   them the judgment written: this honor is to all his merciful ones.
   Hallelujah.


   5. They shall rejoice. In making mention here of joy, jubilee, and the
   high praises of God, he shows still more clearly from the effects which
   it would produce, that he does not speak of a common benefit of God;
   for had not the deliverance of the people been of a remarkable kind,
   there would have been no occasion for such joy, and even triumph. And
   by these expressions he intimates that the people would not be brought
   back from exile to be immediately dispersed again, but to flourish in
   the enjoyment of every species of blessing. He on this account makes
   mention of couches, teaching them to expect daily rest under the divine
   protection. He declares that they would be furnished with arms and
   power, not only to ward off enemies, but to put them to flight on every
   side, so as to reduce to subjection kings and nations which formerly
   ruled over them. By swords of a double-mouth, or two-edged, are meant
   such as cut on both sides, for at that time swords had but one edge.

   7. To execute vengeance, etc. Both during their exile and after their
   return from it, this might seem to be altogether incredible. Nor did it
   take place before the advent of Christ; for though the Machabaei and
   their posterity reduced the neighboring nations to subjection, this was
   but a faint prelude and earnest to direct the thoughts of the Lord's
   people to what was approaching. But as Haggai prophesied that the glory
   of the second Temple would be greater than of the first, so here there
   is promised a more prosperous state than had ever existed. (Haggai
   2:9.) Reduced as the Jews were in numbers, and low as was the state of
   things among them, the Psalmist announces to all nations which opposed
   and troubled them, that they would have the ascendancy. As they were
   yet tributary, and dwelt at Jerusalem only by sufferance, they were
   called to exercise faith in a promise which, to the judgment of sense,
   might appear visionary, and to raise their thoughts to the infinite
   power of God, which triumphs over all worldly obstacles. The vengeance
   spoken of is such as the Israelites would take, not under the influence
   of private resentment, but by commandment of God; and this we mention
   that none may infer that they are allowed to take vengeance for
   personal injuries.

   The next verse, where mention is made of kings and nobles, is an
   amplification; for had he only spoken of peoples and nations, this
   might have been restricted to the common people and men of low
   condition. Here is something much greater -- that kings and others of
   noble rank would be dragged to punishment in chains. But it is to be
   remembered, as I have just hinted, that but a small part of this
   splendid prospect was realized until Christ appeared; for any small
   increase of prosperity which the people enjoyed under the Machabaei was
   not worthy of any consideration, except in so far as by this help God
   sustained the drooping spirits of the people up to Christ's advent.
   Here the prediction of Jacob is to be noticed --

   "the scepter shall not depart from Judah, until Shiloh come." (Genesis
   49:10.)

   But the Machabaei sprung from another tribe. We must, infer, therefore,
   that the regular order was then interrupted, and that to make the
   prosperous state of the people to have been based upon their victories,
   is building a castle in the air. And God would appear designedly to
   have removed the government from the tribe of Judah, lest this success
   should intoxicate the minds of his people; for most of them, through
   pride in these signal victories, overlooked the true and substantial
   deliverance. As the Psalmist treats here of the perfection of the
   prosperity of the people, it follows that he refers to the Messiah,
   that their expectation and desire of him might never cease either in
   their prosperity or adversity.

   9. To perform the judgment, etc. He qualifies what he had said in the
   previous verses, in which he might have appeared to arm the Lord's
   people for deeds of warlike cruelty. At first sight it might appear
   strange, that they who were called the merciful ones of God, should be
   sent out with drawn swords to commit slaughter, and pour out human
   blood; for what evidence was here of mercy? But when God himself is the
   author of the vengeance taken, it is just judgment, not cruelty. When
   mention is made of the judgment written, the Psalmist reminds the Jews
   that they were called to liberty by command of God -- to that liberty
   which had been unjustly wrested from them by' foreigners and tyrants,
   and that they could not be blamed for executing judgment written. Any
   exposition of the passage is faulty which does not proceed upon this as
   being the Psalmist's design, that he would have the Jews to consider
   the divine mandate, not to proceed under the influence of private
   resentment, and to throw a rein over passion; saying upon the matter,
   that God's children may not execute vengeance but when called to it,
   there being an end of all moderation when men yield themselves up to
   the impulse of their own spirits. Another question might arise here by
   way of objection. Christ is said to have come without crying or lifting
   up his voice, that he might not break the bruised reed, (Matthew
   12:20,) and he inculcates the same character upon his followers. The
   answer is obvious, that Christ is also armed with an iron scepter, by
   which to bruise the rebellious, and is elsewhere described as stained
   with blood, as slaying his enemies on every side, and not being wearied
   with the slaughter of them. (Isaiah 63:2.) Nor is it surprising,
   considering the obstinacy which universally prevails in the world, that
   the mercy which is treated with such indignity should be converted into
   severity. Now the doctrine laid down in the passage admits of being
   rightly applied to our practice, in this way, that what is here said of
   the two-edged sword, applies more especially to the Jews, and not
   properly to us, who have not a power of this kind permitted; except,
   indeed, that rulers and magistrates are vested by God with the sword to
   punish all manner of violence; but this is something peculiar to their
   office. [305] As to the Church collective, the sword now put into our
   hand is of another kind, that of the word and spirit, that we may slay
   for a sacrifice to God those who formerly were enemies, or again
   deliver them over to everlasting destruction unless they repent.
   (Ephesians 6:17.) For what Isaiah predicted of Christ extends to all
   who are his members, --

   "He shall smite the wicked with the word of his mouth,
   and shall slay them with the breath of his lips."
   (Isaiah 11:4.)

   If believers quietly confine themselves within these limits of their
   calling, they will find that the promise of vengeance upon their
   enemies has not been given in vain. For when God calls us, as I have
   said above, to judgment written, he puts a restraint both upon our
   spirits and actions, so as that we must not attempt what he has not
   commanded. When it is said, in the close of the verse, that this honor
   is to all the merciful ones of God, he not only exhorts to the practice
   of piety, but gives us a support for our encouragement, lest we should
   think that we might be losers by exercising mercy and patience, as most
   men give vent to fury and rage, under the idea that the only way to
   defend their life is by showing the savageness of wolves. Although
   God's people, therefore, have nothing of the strength of the giant, and
   will not move a finger without divine permission, and have a calm
   spirit, the Psalmist declares, that they have an honorable and splendid
   issue out of all their troubles.

   [303] The people of the East sat on couches in their private parties,
   banquets, etc., as well as reposed on them during night. The language
   here may, therefore, be expressive of the praise they would ascribe to
   God at their festal banquets and in their private companies. An
   exhortion has previously been given (Psalm 149:1) to praise God in the
   public assembly. Green supposes that the reference is to the couches on
   which they reclines when they partook of the eucharistical sacrifices.

   PSALM 150.

   The argument of this Psalm is the same with that of the former.

   Hallelujah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Psalm 150:1-6

   1. Praise God in his sanctuary: praise him in the firmament of his
   power. 2. Praise him in, his might; praise him for the plenitude of his
   greatness. 3. Praise him with sound of trumpet, [306] praise him with
   psaltry and harp. 4. Praise him with timbrel [307] and pipe, [308]
   praise him upon chords, [309] and the organ. [310] 5. Praise him upon
   cymbals of sound, praise him upon cymbals of jubilation [311] 6.
   Whatsoever breathes, let it praise God. Hallelujah.


   1. Praise God in his sanctuary. This psalm in general commends the
   spiritual worship of God, which consists in sacrifices of praise. By
   the sanctuary there is little doubt that heaven is here meant, as is
   often the case elsewhere. The second clause is exegetical, for the same
   thing is repeated. But for sanctuary we read rqy, rekia, that is, the
   expanse of heaven, to which is added the epithet of power, because
   there we have a proof of the matchless power of God, so that we cannot
   look to the heavens without being lost in admiration. As to the
   interpretation which some give -- Praise God, ye angels who inhabit the
   heavens, and ye men who dwell under the firmament, it is forced and
   unnatural; for the Psalmist, in order to awaken men who grow languid in
   God's praises, bids them lift their eyes towards the heavenly
   sanctuary. That the majesty of God may be duly reverenced, the Psalmist
   represents him as presiding on his throne in the heavens; and he
   enlarges upon the same truth in the second verse, celebrating his power
   and his greatness, which he had brought under our notice in the
   heavens, which are a mirror in which they may be seen. If we would have
   our minds kindled, then, to engage in this religious service, let us
   meditate upon his power and greatness, which will speedily dispel all
   such insensibility. Though our minds can never take in this immensity,
   the mere taste of it will deeply affect us. And God will not reject
   such praises as we offer according to our capacity.

   3. Praise him with sound of trumpet. I do not insist upon the words in
   the Hebrew signifying the musical instruments; only let the reader
   remember that sundry different kinds are here mentioned, which were in
   use under the legal economy, the more forcibly to teach the children of
   God that they cannot apply themselves too diligently to the praises of
   God -- as if he would enjoin them strenuously to bring to this service
   all their powers, and devote themselves wholly to it. Nor was it
   without reason that God under the law enjoined this multiplicity of
   songs, that he might lead men away from those vain and corrupt
   pleasures to which they are excessively addicted, to a holy and
   profitable joy. Our corrupt nature indulges in extraordinary liberties,
   many devising methods of gratification which are preposterous, while
   their highest satisfaction lies in suppressing all thoughts of God.
   This perverse disposition could only be corrected in the way of God's
   retaining a weak and ignorant people under many restraints, and
   constant exercises. The Psalmist, therefore, in exhorting believers to
   pour forth all their joy in the praises of God, enumerates, one upon
   another, all the musical instruments which were then in use, and
   reminds them that they ought all to be consecrated to the worship of
   God.

   6. Whatever breathes, etc. As the word nsmh, neshamah, means breath, or
   blowing, and whatever is animate, or breathes, the words may be
   extended to every kind of living creatures, as we have seen in the
   preceding psalms that the declaration of God's praises is assigned even
   to things wanting intelligence. But as men exclusively are often meant
   under the name of "flesh," so we may very well suppose that the words
   have reference here to men, who, although they have vital breath in
   common with the brute creation, obtain by way of distinction the name
   of breathing, as of living creatures. I am led to think this for the
   following reason: As yet the Psalmist has addressed himself in his
   exhortations to the people who were conversant with the ceremonies
   under the law, now he turns to men in general, tacitly intimating that
   a time was coming when the same songs, which were then only heard in
   Judea, would resound in every quarter of the globe. And in this
   prediction we have been joined in the same symphony with the Jews, that
   we may worship God with constant sacrifices of praise, until being
   gathered into the kingdom of heaven, we sing with elect angels an
   eternal hallelujah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [306] "The trumpets of the last Temple were probably formed after the
   ancient model; and as these are represented among the spoils of that
   Temple on the Triumphal Arch of Titus at Rome, we are enabled to see
   that they were long straight trumpets, of a form which has always been
   and continues to be common... Trumpets and horns are the only
   instruments concerning which any directions are given in the law. In
   the infancy of a state,' says Burney, a nation has but little leisure
   for cultivating music any otherwise than as it is connected with
   religious rites and the military art;' and it is thus that he accounts
   for the fact, that (with the exception of Miriam's timbrel) no
   instruments but horns and trumpets are noticed in the Law. And, indeed,
   it may be said that they are scarcely mentioned as musical instruments,
   but as suited to and employed for making signals, calls, and conveying
   instructions during the religious solemnities, and in the field of
   war... It is clear, however, that trumpets and cornets were introduced
   into the musical choirs in the time of David; while they still
   continued to be employed in their former service. The following
   particulars concerning the use of trumpets in the Temple will be
   useful, and are collected chiefly from Lightfoot's Temple Service.' The
   trumpets were sounded exclusively by the priests who stood not in the
   Levitical choir, but apart and opposite to the Levites, on the other
   side of the altar, both parties looking towards it--the priests on the
   west side, and the Levites on the east. The trumpets did not join in
   the concert; but were sounded during certain regulated pauses in the
   vocal and instrumental music "--Illustrated Commentary upon the Bible..

   [307] See [5]footnote 293, Psalm 149:3.

   [308] See [6]footnote 292, Psalm 149:3.

   [309] The original word is vmnym "This word occurring nowhere else, it
   is impossible to ascertain what kind of instrument this was, but as
   Edwards, upon the authority of Rabbi Hannase makes, it a stringed
   instrument, and the word is probably derived from mnh, to number,
   probably it was so called from the extraordinary number of strings
   which it had; and perhaps it was the decachord, mentioned in Psalm
   33:2, which, having ten strings, might be called Minim, kat exochen, as
   consisting of the greatest number of strings in use among the Jews." --
   Dimock.

   [310] The Hebrew name is gv, ougab. This instrument is equal in
   antiquity to the knvr, kinnor, both being mentioned in Genesis 4:21, as
   the invention of Jubal. These are the two first musical instruments the
   invention of which is recorded in Scripture, and the only ones
   mentioned before the deluge. Subsequently they are almost always
   mentioned in connection with each other. The ougab was not that
   complicated instrument which goes by the name of the organ in the
   present day. Calmet supposes it to have been a flute which consisted of
   a number of pipes, of unequal thickness and length, set close or joined
   together, which gave harmonious sound when blown into, by moving them
   successively under the lower lip. Such is the common opinion, and there
   seems no ground to dispute its correctness. This instrument was the
   small organ or syrinx, or fistula Panis of antiquity; its invention
   having been ascribed to Pan, the great sylvan god, who was usually
   figured with the instrument in his hands. According to the fable, he
   formed it of reeds which grew by the river, and played upon it while
   his goats were feeding on the banks; which shows that it was regarded
   as properly a pastoral instrument, and as such it seems to be mentioned
   by Job. (Job 21:11, 12.) The principle of its construction is so
   simple, that it is among the most widely diffused of musical
   instruments. It is in common use in the island of New Amsterdam, in the
   South Seas, as flutes and drums have been found in Otaheite and New
   Zealand, an uncontestable proof that these are instruments which tribes
   the most barbarous and the most remote from each other naturally
   invent. The number of tubes, as represented on ancient monuments,
   varies from seven to eleven.

   [311] Of the Hebrew musical instrument called tsltsl, tsiltel, or
   "cymbal," as Calvin here renders it, and as it is rendered in the
   Septuagint and Vulgate, two kinds are here mentioned -- tsltslym,
   "tsiltelim," or, "cymbals of sound," and "tsiltelim," or "cymbals of
   jubilation." The specific difference between these two sorts of the
   same instrument is not accurately marked. The latter were probably of a
   larger size than the farmer, or made of such a shape or of such metals
   as to emit a louder sound. The former are translated by French and
   Skinner, "the soft cymbal." The literal translation of the Hebrew is,
   "cymbals of hearing," i.e., say these critics, "cymbals which when
   struck do not overpower the voices of the singers." They translate the
   latter, "the loud cymbals." The ancient cymbals were two convex or
   hollow plates of brass or other metal, as silver or copper, made in the
   form of cups, which were held in each hand, and which being struck
   against each other produced a sharp clanging sound. Some, however,
   think that the word tsiltzel exclusively denotes the sistrum, and that
   cymbals, properly speaking, are denoted by the word slysym shalishim,
   in 1 Samuel 18:6, which is, equally with the other, rendered cymbala by
   the Septuagint and the Vulgate, and which our authorized version
   translates "instruments of music." It is difficult to decide as to
   these two opinions; but it seems admitted on all hands that both
   cymbals and sistrums were in use among the Jews. The sistrum was a
   concave plate of sonorous metal, and of an oval configuration, crossed
   by bars of the same metal with reverted ends. These bars moved freely
   in the holes through which they passed, and when the instrument was
   shaken by the handle to which it was fixed, the reverted ends striking
   upon the body of the instrument produced the sound. It had generally
   three or four transverse bars. It was much used by the Egyptians in
   their religious services, and actual specimens of it of an ancient date
   have been discovered. See [7]volume 3

   8 O Jehovah! lead me in thy righteousness, because of my adversaries;
   Make straight before my face thy way.

   9 For there is not in their mouth uprightness; Their inward part is
   deep depravity; A sepulcher that is open is their throat; With their
   tongues they deal deceitfully.

   10 Cause them to err, O God! Let them fall from their counsels; In the
   multitude of their transgressions destroy them; For they have rebelled
   against thee.

   11 And rejoice let all those who trust in thee, For ever let them
   exult; and cover thou them, And let those delight in thee that love thy

   6 I have become wearied with my groaning; I make to swim every night my
   bed; With my tears my couch I water.

   7 Waxed dim for vexation hath mine eye; It hath become old among all my
   persecutors.

   8 Depart from me, all ye workers of iniquity; For heard hath the Lord
   the voice of my weeping.

   9 Heard hath the Lord my supplication; The Lord my prayer will receive.

   10 Put to shame and confounded greatly be all my enemies; Let them turn
   back, and be ashamed suddenly.

   PSALM 7

   Shiggaion of David, which he sung to Jehovah, upon the words
   of Cush the Benjamite

   1 O Jehovah, my God! in thee do I trust: Save me from all them that
   persecute me, and deliver me:

   2 Lest He seize, as a lion, upon my soul, And tear it in pieces while
   there is none to deliver it.

   3 O Jehovah, my God! if I have done this, If there be iniquity in my
   hands,

   4 If I have rewarded to him that was at peace with me evil, And have
   not delivered him that afflicted me without cause;

   5 Pursue let the enemy my soul and take it, And let him cast down to
   the earth my life, And my glory in the dust let him hold down. Selah

   6 Arise, O Jehovah! in thy anger; Lift up thyself against the fury of
   my enemies; And awake thou for me to the judgment which thou hast
   ordained.

   7 And the congregation of peoples shall be round about thee: And on
   account of this, do thou on high return.

   8 Jehovah shall judge the peoples: Judge me, O Jehovah! according to my
   righteousness, And according to the integrity which is in me.

   9 Let come to an end, I pray, the malice of the wicked; And direct thou
   the righteous man: For he proves the hearts and the reins, the
   righteous God.

   10 My shield is in God, Who saves the upright in heart.

   11 God judgeth the righteous man, And him who despiseth God, daily.

   12 If he turn not, his sword he will whet; His bow he hath bent, he
   hath made it ready.

   13 And for it he hath prepared the instruments of death; He shall make
   fit his arrows for the persecutors.

   14 Behold! he shall travail to bring forth iniquity, And he hath
   conceived wickedness, And he shall bring forth falsehood.

   15 A pit he hath digged, and hollowed it out; And he hath fallen into
   the ditch which he hath made.

   16 Return shall his wickedness upon his own head, And upon his own
   crown his violence shall descend.

   17 I will praise Jehovah, according to his righteousness; And I will
   sing to the name of Jehovah, Most High.

   PSALM 8

   To the chief Musician upon Hagittith. A Psalm of David

   1 O Jehovah, our Lord! How wonderful is thy name in all the earth, To
   set thy glory above the heavens!

   2 Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings Thou hast founded thy
   strength, because of thy adversaries, To put to flight the enemy and
   the avenger.

   3 When! see thy heavens, the works of thy fingers; The moon and the
   stars which thou hast arranged:

   4 What is man that thou art mindful of him? And the son of man, that
   thou visitest him?

   5 For thou hast made him lower a little than God, And with glory and
   honor thou hast crowned him.

   6 Thou hast set him over the works of thy hands: All things thou hast
   put under his feet.

   7 Sheep and oxen, all of them, And also the beasts of the fields;

   8 The fowl of the heavens, and the fish of the sea, And whatsoever
   passeth through the paths of the seas.

   9 O Jehovah, our Lord! How wonderful is thy name in all the earth!

   PSALM 9

   To the chief Musician upon Hagittith. Almuth Laben. A Psalm of David

   1 I will praise Jehovah with my whole heart; will recount all thy
   marvelous works.

   2 I will rejoice and exult in thee; I will celebrate in Psalms thy
   name, O thou Most high!

   3 When turned are my enemies backward, They fall and are put to flight
   at thy presence.

   4 For thou hast maintained my judgment and my cause; Thou hast sat upon
   the throne a righteous judge.

   5 Thou hast rebuked the heathen; Thou hast destroyed the ungodly; Their
   name thou hast blotted out for ever and ever.

   6 O thou enemy! come to an end are desolations for ever; And cities
   thou hast destroyed; Perished has their memory with them.

   7 And Jehovah for ever sitteth: His throne for judgment he hath
   prepared.

   8 And he shall judge the world in righteousness; He shall judge the
   peoples in rectitude.

   9 And Jehovah will be a place of defense to the poor, And a protection
   in seasonable times in trouble.

   10 And trust in thee shall those who know thy name: For thou forsakest
   not those who seek thee, O Jehovah!

   11 Sing psalms to Jehovah, who dwelleth in Zion, Proclaim among the
   peoples his doings;

   12 For in requiring blood, it he hath remembered: He hath not forgotten
   the cry of the poor.

   13 Have mercy upon me, O Jehovah! See my affliction from those who
   persecute me, O thou that liftest me up from the gates of death;

   14 That I may recount all thy praises in the gates of the daughter of
   Zion; That I may exult in thy salvation.

   15 Sunk are the heathen into the pit which they have made; In the net
   which they have hid taken are their own feet.

   16 Known is Jehovah by executing judgment: In the work of his own hands
   the wicked is snared. Higgaion Selah.

   17 Turned shall be the wicked into hell: All the nations that forget
   God.

   18 For not for ever shall be forgotten the poor; The hope of the humble
   shall not perish for ever.

   19 Arise, O Jehovah! let not man prevail: Let the heathen be judged in
   thy sight.

   20 Put, O Jehovah! fear in them, That the heathen may know that mortal
   men they are. Selah.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 10

   1 Why, O Jehovah! standest thou afar off? And winkest at seasonable
   times in trouble?

   2 In his pride the ungodly doth persecute the poor; Let them be caught
   in the devices which they imagine.

   3 For praise himself doth the ungodly on account of the desire of his
   own soul; And the violent man blesseth himself: He despiseth Jehovah.

   4 The ungodly, in the pride of his countenance doth not inquire; All
   his devices say, "There is not a God."

   5 Prosperous are his ways at all times; High are thy judgments before
   him; At all his enemies he puffeth.

   6 He saith in his heart, "I shall not be moved from generation to
   generation," Because he is not in adversity,

   7 Of cursing his mouth is full, and of deceit, and of malice: Under his
   tongue are mischief and iniquity.

   8 He will sit in the ensnaring places of the villages; In his lurking
   places will he murder the innocent: His eyes against the poor will take
   their aim.

   9 He will lie in wait in secret, as a lion in his den; He will lie in
   wait to catch the poor; He will catch the poor by drawing him into his
   net.

   10 He will crouch low, he will cast himself down; Then shall fall by
   his strengths an army of the afflicted.

   11 He hath said in his heart, "Forgotten it hath God; "He hideth his
   face, that he may not see it for ever."

   12 Arise, O Jehovah, God! lift up thy hand: Do not forget the poor.

   13 Why do the wicked despise God? He saith in his heart, "Thou wilt not
   require it."

   14 Thou hast seen it; For mischief and oppression thou considerest,
   That thou mayest take them into thy own hand: Upon thee shall the poor
   leave; To the orphan thou wilt be an helper.

   15 Break thou the arm of the wicked and the evil man; Thou shalt seek
   his wickedness, and shalt not find it.

   16 Jehovah is King for ever and ever; Perished are the heathen out of
   his land.

   17 The desire of the needy thou hast heard, O Jehovah! Thou wilt direct
   their heart; Hear shall thine car:

   18 That thou mayest judge the fatherless and the poor, That the man who
   is of earth may terrify no more.

   PSALM 11

   To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David

   1 In Jehovah do I put my trust: How then say ye to my soul, "Flee ye
   into your mountain as a bird?"

   2 Surely behold! the ungodly shall bend the bow, They have made ready
   their arrows upon the string, shoot in secret at the upright in heart.

   3 Truly, the foundations are destroyed: The righteous, what hath he
   done?

   4 Jehovah is in the palace of his holiness; Jehovah in heaven hath his
   throne; His eyes behold, his eyelids consider the children of men.

   5 Jehovah will approve the righteous man; But the ungodly and him who
   loveth iniquity, hate doth his soul.

   6 He will rain upon the ungodly snares, Fire and brimstone, and a storm
   of whirlwinds: This is the portion of their cup.

   7 For the righteous Jehovah loveth righteousness; His countenance
   approveth the upright.

   PSALM 12

   To the Chief Musician upon the Eighth. A Psalm of David

   1 Save me, O Jehovah! for failed hath the merciful man, For wasted away
   are the faithful from among the children of men.

   2 Deceit doth every one speak with his neighbor; With lips of
   flatteries, with a double heart do they speak.

   3 Let Jehovah cut off all lips of flatteries, The tongue that great
   things doth speak:

   4 Those who have said, "By our tongues we will be strengthened; "Our
   lips are our own; who is lord over us?"

   5 "Because of the spoiling of the needy, "Because of the groaning of
   the poor, "Now will I arise," say will Jehovah, "I will set in safety
   him for whom the wicked man layeth snares."

   6 The words of Jehovah are pure words; Silver melted in an excellent
   crucible of earth, purified seven times.

   7 Thou, O Jehovah! wilt keep them; Thou wilt preserve him from this
   generation for ever.

   8 On every side the ungodly walk; When they are exalted, reproach is to
   the children of men.

   PSALM 13

   To the chief Musician. A Psalm of David

   1 How long, O Jehovah! wilt thou forget me for ever? How long wilt thou
   hide thy face from me?

   2 How long shall I take counsel in my soul? And have sorrow in my heart
   daily? How long exalted shall be my enemy over me?

   3 Look upon me, answer me, O Jehovah, my God! Enlighten my eyes, lest I
   sleep in death;

   4 Lest my enemy say, "I have prevailed against him;" And those who
   afflict me rejoice if I should fall.

   5 But as for me, in thy goodness I trust; Exult shall my heart in thy
   salvation. I will sing to the Lord because he hath dealt bountifully
   with me.

   PSALM 14

   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm Of David

   1 The fool hath said in his heart, "There is no God;" They have
   corrupted [all good order,] they have done abominable work. There is
   none that doeth good.

   2 Jehovah from heaven looked down Upon the children of men, To see
   whether there were any that did understand, And seek after God.

   3 Every one of them hath gone aside, Together putrid have they become:
   There is none that doeth good, not even one.

   4 Have they no knowledge all these workers of iniquity? Who eat up my
   people as they eat bread. Upon the Lord they do not call.

   5 There did they tremble with fear, For God is in the generation of the
   righteous.

   6 The counsel of the poor ye deride, Because Jehovah is his hope.

   7 Who shall give from Zion salvation to Israel? When turn back shall
   Jehovah the captivity of his people, Rejoice shall Jacob, and exult
   shall Israel.

   PSALM 15

   A Psalm of David

   1 O Jehovah! who shall dwell in thy tabernacle? Who shall rest in the
   mountain of thy holiness?

   2 He who walketh in integrity and doeth righteousness, And who speaketh
   truth in his heart,

   3 He who detracteth not with his tongue, Who doeth not to his companion
   evil, And a calumnious report doth not raise up against his neighbor.

   4 Despised in his eyes is the off cast; But those who fear the Lord he
   honoreth; When he hath sworn to his own hurt he doth not change.

   5 His money he doth not put out to usury; And a present upon the
   innocent he doth not accept: He who doeth these things shall not be
   moved for ever.

   PSALM 16

   Michtam. A Psalm Of David

   1 Keep me, O God! For in thee do I trust.

   2 Thou shalt say to Jehovah, "My Lord thou art; "My well doing
   extendeth not to thee."

   3 To the saints who are on the earth, And to the excellent; all my
   delight is in them.

   4 Multiplied shall be their sorrows who offer to a stranger; I will not
   taste their libations of blood, Nor will I take their names in my lips.

   5 Jehovah is the portion of my inheritance, and of my cup; Thou
   maintainest my lot.

   6 The lines have fallen to me in pleasant places; Yea, an inheritance
   that is goodly hath fallen to me.

   7 I will magnify Jehovah, who giveth me counsel; Even in the nights
   instruct me do my reins.

   8 I have set Jehovah before me continually; Since he is at my right
   hand, I shall not be moved.

   9 Therefore glad is my heart, rejoice doth my tongue; Also my flesh
   dwelleth in confidence.

   10 For thou wilt not leave my soul in the grave; Nor wilt thou make thy
   Holy One to see the pit.

   11 Thou wilt make known to me the way of life; Fullness of joy is in
   thy countenance; Pleasures are at thy right hand for evermore.

   PSALM 17

   A Prayer of David

   1 Hear, O Jehovah! my righteousness; Attend to my cry; Hearken to my
   prayer, which is not in lips of deceit.

   2 From the presence of thy countenance let my judgment go forth Let
   thine eyes behold uprightness.

   3 Thou hast proved my heart; Thou hast visited it by night; Thou hast
   examined it, thou shalt not find any thing in it; My thought shall not
   pass beyond my mouth.

   4 As for the works of men, by the word of thy lips I have taken heed of
   the ways of the destroyer.

   5 Uphold my steps in thy paths, That my footsteps may not slide.

   6 I have called upon thee, surely thou wilt hear me, O God! Incline thy
   ear to me, and hear my speech.

   7 Make marvelous thy mercies, O thou Preserver of those who trust [in
   thee,] From those that exalt themselves against thy right hand.

   8 Keep me as the apple, the daughter of the eye; In the shadow of thy
   wings hide me,

   9 From the face of the ungodly who endeavor to destroy me -- Of my
   enemies who in my soul besiege me.

   10 In their own fat they have enclosed themselves; With their mouth
   they have spoken haughtily.

   11 In our steps they have now encompassed me; eyes they have set to
   east down to the ground.

   12 He is like a lion, he desireth to seize his prey, And like a lion's
   whelp which lurketh in secret places.

   13 Arise, O Jehovah! confront him, lay him prostrate; Deliver my soul
   from the ungodly man by thy sword

   14 From men by thy hand, O Jehovah! -- From men who are of long
   duration, Whose portion is in life, Whose belly thou fillets with thy
   secret, goods: Filled to the full are their children with them, And
   their residue they leave to their babes.

   15 As for me in righteousness I shall behold thy face; I shall be
   satisfied when I shall awake with thy likeness.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 18

   To the Chief Musician. Of the servant of Jehovah, David, who spake to
   Jehovah the words of this song, in the day that Jehovah delivered him
   from the hand of all his enemies, and from the hand of Saul. And he
   said,

   1 I will love thee, O Jehovah! my strength;

   2 Jehovah my rock, my fortress, and my deliverer; My God, my rock, I
   will hope in him: My shield and the horn of my salvation, my refuge.

   3 Upon the praised Jehovah will I call; And from my enemies I shall be
   saved.

   4 Encompassed me had the cords of death. The torrents of ungodliness
   had affrighted me.

   5 The cords of the grave had encompassed me; Prevented me had the
   snares of death.

   6 In my distress I called upon Jehovah, And to my God I cried: And he
   heard from his temple my voice, And my cry before him came, [even] into
   his ears.

   7 Then shake and tremble did the earth; And the foundations of the
   mountains were troubled and shaken, Because he was wroth.

   8 There ascended smoke out of his nostrils, And fire proceeding from
   his mouth consumed; Coals were kindled by it.

   9 And he bowed the heavens and descended; And thick darkness was under
   his feet.

   10 And he rode upon a cherub and flew; And was carried upon the wings
   of the wind.

   11 He made darkness his hiding place; Round about him his pavilion was
   dark waters, And the clouds of the skies.

   12 At the brightness which was before him his clouds passed away,
   [There were] hail-storm, and coals of fire.

   13 And thunder in the heavens did Jehovah, And the Most High sent forth
   his voice; [There were] hailstorm and coals of fire.

   14 And he sent out his army and scattered them; And lightnings he
   multiplied, and put them into confusion.

   15 And seen were the abysses of the waters, And disclosed were the
   foundations of the world, At thy rebuke, O Jehovah! At the blast of the
   breath of thy nostrils.

   16 He sent from on high, he took me; He drew me from waters great.

   17 He delivered me from my enemy [that was] strong, And from my
   adversary; Because they were stronger than I.

   18 They had prevented me in the day of my calamity; And Jehovah was a
   support for me.

   19 And he brought me forth into a wide place; He rescued me because he
   wished well to me.

   20 Rewarded me hath Jehovah according to my righteousness; According to
   the purity of my hands he hath repaid me;

   21 Because I have kept the ways of Jehovah, And have not impiously
   departed from my God;

   22 Because all his judgments I have had before me, And his statutes I
   have not removed from me.

   23 And I have been upright with him, And have kept me from my iniquity.

   24 And repaid me hath Jehovah according to my righteousness According
   to the purity of my hands before his eyes.

   25 With the merciful thou wilt deal mercifully, With a man of
   uprightness thou wilt show thyself upright.

   26 With the pure thou wilt be pure, And with the perverse thou wilt
   deal perversely.

   27 For thou the afflicted people wilt save, And the haughty eyes thou
   wilt east down.

   28 For thou shalt light my lamp, O Jehovah! My God shall enlighten my
   darkness.

   29 For by thee I shall break through the wedge of a troop, And by my
   God I shall leap over a wall.

   30 As for God perfect is his way; The word of Jehovah [is] refined; A
   shield is He to all who confide in him.

   31 For who is God besides Jehovah? And who is strong except our God?

   32 It is God who hath girded me with strength, And hath made perfect my
   way.

   33 He maketh my feet like those of hinds, And upon my high places he
   hath set me.

   34 He traineth my hands to the battle, And broken will be a bow of
   steel by my arms.

   35 And thou hast given me the shield of thy salvation, And thy right
   hand hath sustained me, And thy clemency hath increased me.

   36 Thou hast enlarged my steps under me, And my ankles shall not
   totter.

   37 I will pursue my enemies and will seize them; Nor will I return
   until I have consumed them.

   38 I have afflicted them, and they were not able to rise; They have
   fallen under my feet.

   39 Thou hast girded me with might for the battle; Thou hast bowed down
   my enemies under me.

   40 And of my enemies thou hast given me the neck, And [as for] my
   haters I will destroy them.

   41 They shall cry aloud, and there shall be no Savior for them; To
   Jehovah, but he shall not answer them.

   42 And I will bruise them to powder as dust before the wind; As the
   mire of the streets I will tread upon them.

   43 Thou shalt deliver me from the contentions of the people; Thou shalt
   make me head of the nations; A people whom I have not known shall serve
   me.

   44 At the hearing of the ear they shall obey me; The children of
   strangers shall lie to me;

   45 The children of strangers shall lose courage, And tremble from
   within their places of concealment.

   46 Let Jehovah live and blessed be my strength, And let the God of my
   salvation be exalted:

   47 The God who giveth vengeance for me, And subdueth peoples under me.

   48 My deliverer from my enemies: Yea, from those who had risen up
   against me thou hast lifted me up: From the man of violence thou hast
   rescued me.

   49 Therefore will I praise thee, O Jehovah! among the Gentiles, And to
   thy name will I sing.

   50 Who worketh great deliverances for his king, And showeth mercy to
   his anointed, [even to] David, And to his seed for ever.

   PSALM 19

   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David

   1 The heavens recount the glory of God; And the works of his hands
   proclaim doth the expanse.

   2 Day unto day poureth forth speech; And night unto night publisheth
   knowledge.

   3 There is no speech and no language, Where is not heard their voice.

   4 Through all the earth hath gone forth their writing, And to the
   extremity of the world their words: For the sun he hath set a
   tabernacle in them,

   5 And he as a bridegroom goeth forth from his chamber; He exulteth as a
   strong man to run his course.

   6 From one extremity of the heavens is his going forth, And his circuit
   to the utmost limits thereof, And no person is hidden from his heat.

   7 The law of the Lord is perfect, restoring the soul; The testimony of
   Jehovah is faithful, instructing in wisdom the babes;

   8 The statutes of Jehovah are right, rejoicing the heart; The
   commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes;

   9 The fear of Jehovah is clean, enduring for ever; The judgments of
   Jehovah are truth, they are justified together.

   10 More desirable [are they] than gold, and much fine gold; And sweeter
   than honey, and the dropping of honeycombs.

   11 Moreover, thy servant is made circumspect by them; And in their
   observance the reward is great.

   12 His errors who can understand? From my hidden sins cleanse thou me.

   13 Likewise from presumptuous sins restrain thou thy servant, That they
   may not have dominion over me; Then upright shall I be and clean from
   much wickedness.

   14 Let the words of my mouth, and the meditation of my heart be
   acceptable Before thee, O Jehovah! my strength and my Redeemer.

   PSALM 20

   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm Of David

   1 May Jehovah hear thee in the day of trouble!

   2 May he send help to thee from the sanctuary! And out of Zion sustain
   thee!

   3 May he be mindful of all thy offerings! And thy holocaust may he make
   flit! Selah.

   4 May he give to thee according to thy heart! And all thy counsel may
   he fulfill!

   5 That we may exult in thy salvation, And in the name of our God erect
   a banner, When Jehovah shall fulfill all thy petitions.

   6 Now I have known that Jehovah hath saved his anointed; He will hear
   him from the heavens of his sanctuary, In the mightiness of the
   salvation of his right hand.

   7 Some trust in chariots, and some in horses; But the name of Jehovah
   our God we will remember.

   8 They are bowed down and fallen; But we are risen up and stand erect.

   9 O Jehovah! do thou save; Let the King hear us in the day that we call
   upon him.

   PSALM 21

   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm Of David

   1 O Jehovah! in thy strength rejoice shall the king, And in thy
   salvation how greatly shall he exult!

   2 The desire of his heart thou hast given him, And what he uttered with
   his lips, thou hast not denied him. Selah.

   3 For thou shalt prevent him with blessings of good; Thou shalt place
   upon his head a crown of gold.

   4 Life he asked from thee; Thou hast given him length of days for ever
   and ever.

   5 Great is his glory in thy salvation: Splendor and beauty thou hast
   put upon him.

   6 For thou hast set him [to be] blessings for ever: Thou hast gladdened
   him with joy before thy countenance.

   7 For the king trusteth in Jehovah; And through the goodness of the
   Most High, he shall not be moved

   8 Find out shall thy hand all thy enemies; Thy right hand shall find
   out thy haters.

   9 Thou shalt put them as in a furnace of fire in the time of thy wrath,
   O Jehova! In his wrath he shall overwhelm them, And consume them shall
   the fire.

   10 Their fruit from the earth thou wilt destroy, And their seed from
   among the sons of men.

   11 For they have spread out against thee evil; They have devised
   against thee a stratagem which they could not accomplish.

   12 For thou wilt set them as a butt; On thy strings thou shalt make
   ready thy arrows against their faces.

   13 Be thou exalted, O Jehovah! in thy strength, Then we will sing and
   celebrate in psalms thy power.

   PSALM 22

   To the Chief Musician. Upon the hind of the morning. A Psalm Of David

   1 My God! my God! why hast thou forsaken me? [Why art thou] far from my
   help, from the words of my roaring?

   2 O my God! I cry by day, and thou dost not hear: And in the night, and
   am not silent.

   3 Yet thou art holy, Inhabiting the praises of Israel.

   4 In thee trust did our fathers: They trusted, and thou didst deliver
   them.

   5 To thee they cried, and were saved: In thee they trusted, and were
   not put to shame.

   6 But I am a worm, and not a man; The reproach of men, and despised of
   the people.

   7 All who see me scoff at me: They thrust out the lip, they shake the
   head.

   8 "He hath devolved," say they, "upon Jehovah, his cause, let him
   rescue him, "Let him deliver him, since he hath a favor for him."

   9 Surely it is thou who didst take me out of the womb, Causing me to
   confide upon the breasts of my mother.

   10 Upon thee I was cast from the womb: From the belly of my mother my
   God art thou.

   11 Depart not far from me, for trouble is near, For there is no helper.

   12 Encompassed me have bulls [that are] strong, The bulls of Bashan
   have beset me.

   13 They have opened upon me their mouth, As a lion ravening and
   roaring.

   14 Like water I have flowed, [314] And disjointed have been [315] all
   my bones: My heart hath been [316] like wax, It hath been [317] melted
   in the midst of my bowels.

   15 Dried up as a potsherd hath been [318] my strength, And my tongue
   cleaveth to my jaws; And to the dust of death thou hast brought me.

   16 For encompassed me have dogs; The assembly of the wicked have
   surrounded me: They have pierced my hands and my feet.

   17 I will count all my bones; As for them they look and gaze upon me.

   18 They divide my garments among them; Upon my vesture they cast the
   lot.

   19 And thou, O Jehovah! be not far from me; Thou who art my strength,
   to my aid hasten.

   20 Rescue from the sword my soul; From the hand of the dog my only one.

   21 Save me from the mouth of the lion, And from the horns of unicorns
   do thou hear me.

   22 I will declare thy name to my brethren; In the midst of the assembly
   will I praise thee.

   23 Saying, "Ye who fear Jehovah praise him: "All ye the seed of Jacob
   glorify him: "And stand in awe of him, all ye the seed of Israel.

   24 "For he hath not despised nor disdained the poor; "Nor hath he
   hidden his face from him; "And when he cried to him, he heard him."

   25 From thee shall proceed my praise in the congregation great; My vows
   will I pay before them that fear him.

   26 Eat shall the poor, and be satisfied; They shall praise Jehovah who
   seek him; Your heart shall live for ever.

   27 Remember and turn to Jehovah shall all the ends of the earth; And
   prostrate themselves before his face shall all the tribes of the
   Gentiles.

   28 For Jehovah's is the kingdom, That he may have dominion among the
   Gentiles.

   29 Eat and worship shall all the fat ones of the earth: Before his face
   shall bow all who are going down to the dust; And he who his own soul
   doth not quicken.

   30 Their seed shall serve him, It shall be registered to the Lord for a
   generation.

   31 They shall come and shall declare his righteousness, To a people
   that shall be born, because he hath done [this.],

   PSALM 23

   A Psalm of David

   1 Jehovah is my shepherd, therefore I shall not want any thing.

   2 In pastures of grass he maketh me to lie down; To waters gently
   flowing he leadeth me.

   3 My soul he restoreth: He leadeth me by the paths of righteousness for
   his name's sake.

   4 Though I should walk in the valley of the shadow of death, I will not
   fear evil, because thou art with me; Thy staff and thy crook they
   comfort me.

   5 Thou wilt prepare before me a table in the presence of my
   persecutors; Thou wilt anoint with oil my head; My cup overfloweth.

   6 Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me all the days of my life,
   And I shall dwell in the house of Jehovah for a length of days.

   PSALM 24

   A Psalm of David

   1 Jehovah's is the earth, and the fullness thereof; The world, and
   those who dwell therein.

   2 For he upon the seas hath founded it, And upon the floods he hath
   arranged it.

   3 Who shall ascend into the mountain of Jehovah? Who shall stand in the
   place of his holiness?

   4 He who is clean in hands and pure in heart, Who hath not lifted up to
   vanity his soul, And hath not sworn deceitfully.

   5 He shall receive blessing from Jehovah, And righteousness from the
   God of his salvation.

   6 This is the generation of those who seek him, Of those who seek thy
   face, O Jacob! Selah.

   7 Lift up, O ye gates! your heads, And be ye lifted up, ye doors
   everlasting! And enter shall the King of Glory.

   8 Who is this King of Glory? Jehovah strong and mighty, Jehovah mighty
   in power. [319]

   9 Lift up, O ye gates! your heads, Lift up, I say, ye doors
   everlasting! And enter shall the King of Glory.

   10 Who is this King of Glory? Jehovah of armies -- He is the King of
   Glory. Selah.

   PSALM 25

   Of David

   1 To thee, O Jehovah! my soul have I lifted up.

   2 O my God! in thee have I hoped: Let me not be put to shame, Let not
   my enemies rejoice over me.

   3 Yea none who wait on thee shall be put to shame: They shall be
   ashamed who deal perfidiously without cause.

   4 Thy ways, O Jehovah! make me to know, Thy paths teach thou me.

   5 Direct me in thy truth, and teach me; For thou art the God of my
   salvation; For thee I have waited all the day.

   6 Remember thy compassions, O Jehovah! And thy loving-kindnesses; for
   they have been from everlasting.

   7 The transgressions of my youth, and my iniquities do not thou
   remember According to thy clemency remember thou me, For the sake of
   thy goodness, O Jehovah!

   8 Good and upright is Jehovah, Therefore he will teach sinners in the
   way.

   9 He will guide the poor in judgment, And will teach the poor his way.

   10 All the ways of Jehovah are mercy and truth, To those who keep his
   covenant and his testimony.

   11 For the sake of thy name, O Jehovah! Be merciful to my iniquity, for
   great is it.

   12 Who is the man that feareth Jehovah? He will teach him in the way
   which he should choose.

   13 His soul in good shall dwell, And his seed shall inherit the land.

   14 The counsel of Jehovah is to those who fear him, That he may make
   known to them his covenant.

   15 My eyes are continually towards Jehovah, For he will bring out of
   the net my feet.

   16 Have respect to me, take pity upon me, For solitary and poor am I.

   17 The afflictions of my heart are enlarged; Out of my distresses do
   thou bring me.

   18 Behold my affliction and my travail, And take away all my sins.

   19 Behold my enemies, for they are multiplied; And with a violent
   hatred they hate me.

   20 Guard my soul, and rescue me, That I may not be ashamed; For I have
   trusted in thee.

   21 Let integrity and rectitude preserve me; Because I have waited for
   thee.

   22 Redeem O God! Israel from all his troubles.

   PSALM 26

   Of David

   1 Judge me, O Jehovah: Because in my integrity I have walked, And in
   Jehovah have trusted, I shall not stumble.

   2 Prove me, O Jehovah! and try me, Examine my reins and my heart.

   3 For thy goodness is before my eyes; Therefore I have walked in thy
   truth.

   4 I have not sat with men of vanity, And with crafty men I will not go
   in.

   5 I hate the assembly of transgressors, And with the wicked I will not
   sit.

   6 I will wash in purity my hands, And will encompass thy altar, O
   Jehovah!

   7 To cause to be heard the voice of praise, And to tell of all thy
   marvelous deeds.

   8 O Jehovah! I have loved the habitation of thy house, And the place of
   the dwelling of thy glory.

   9 Gather not with ungodly men, my soul, Nor with men of bloods my life.

   10 For in their hands is maliciousness, And their right hand is full of
   bribes.

   11 But as for me in my integrity I will walk: Redeem me, and have mercy
   upon me.

   12 My foot hath stood in uprightness: In the congregations will I bless
   thee, O Jehovah!

   PSALM 27

   Of David

   1 Jehovah is my light and my salvation, Whom shall I fear? Jehovah is
   the strength of my life, Of whom shall I be afraid?

   2 When approach against me did the wicked, To devour my flesh -- My
   oppressors and my enemies against me -- They stumbled and fell.

   3 If there should encamp against me a camp, My heart shall not fear: If
   there should rise against me war, In this shall I have confidence.

   4 One thing have I requested from Jehovah -- This will I follow after
   -- That I may dwell in the house of Jehovah all the days of my life, To
   behold the beauty of Jehovah, To survey his temple.

   5 For he shall hide me in his pavilion in the day of evil; He shall
   conceal me in the secret [recess] of his tent, Upon a rock he will set
   me.

   6 And now he shall exalt my head Above my enemies who surround me: And
   I will sacrifice in his tabernacle sacrifices of triumph; I will sing
   and will celebrate in psalms Jehovah.

   7 Hear, O Jehovah! my voice with which I cry; Have mercy upon me and
   answer me.

   8 To thee my heart hath said, "Seek ye my face;" Therefore thy face, O
   Jehovah! will I seek.

   9 Hide not thy face from me; Cast not away in wrath thy servant: My
   strength thou hast been, do not desert me, And do not forsake me, O God
   of my salvation!

   10 When my father and my mother shall forsake me, Jehovah shall receive
   me.

   11 Teach me, O Jehovah! thy way, And lead me in the path of rectitude
   because of my enemies.

   12 Do not deliver me to the desire of my oppressors, For risen up
   against me have false witnesses, And he who uttereth violence.

   13 Unless I had believed to see the goodness of Jehovah, in the land of
   the living --.

   14 Wait thou on Jehovah; Be strong, and he will comfort thy heart, And
   wait thou on Jehovah.

   PSALM 28

   Of David

   1 Unto thee, O Jehovah! will I cry; O my strength! hold not thy peace
   from me Lest if thou shouldst be silent to me, I then become like those
   who descend into the grave.

   2 Hear the voice of my prayers when I cry to thee, When I lift up my
   hands to the sanctuary of thy holiness.

   3 Draw me not away with ungodly men, And with the workers of iniquity,
   Who speak peace [320] with their neighbors, When in their hearts is
   malice.

   4 Give them according to their works, And according to the wickedness
   of their doings: According to the work of their hands give them, Render
   their reward to them.

   5 Because they do not consider the doing of Jehovah, Nor the work of
   his hands, Let him destroy them and not build them up.

   6 Blessed be Jehovah! For he hath heard the voice of my supplications.

   7 Jehovah is my strength and my shield; In him trusted hath my heart,
   and I have been helped: Therefore exult shall my heart, And with my
   song will I celebrate him.

   8 Jehovah is strength to them, And the strength of the salvations of
   his Anointed is He.

   9 Save thy people, and bless thy inheritance; Feed them and exalt them
   for ever.

   A Psalm of David

   1 Ascribe to Jehovah: ye sons of the mighty -- Ascribe to Jehovah glory
   and strength.

   2 Ascribe to Jehovah the glory of his name; Worship before Jehovah in
   the brightness of his sanctuary.

   3 The voice of Jehovah is upon the waters; The God of glory thundereth;
   Jehovah is upon the waters great.

   4 The voice of Jehovah is in strength, The voice of Jehovah is in
   majesty.

   5 The voice of Jehovah breaketh the cedars; Break, I say, doth Jehovah
   the cedars of Lebanon.

   6 And he maketh Lebanon to leap like a calf, And Sirion like the son of
   the unicorns.

   7 The voice of Jehovah striketh out flames of fire.

   8 The voice of Jehovah maketh the desert to tremble. Jehovah maketh to
   tremble the desert of Kadesh.

   9 The voice of Jehovah maketh the hinds to bring forth, And discovereth
   the forests, And all meanwhile in his temple speak his praise.

   10 Jehovah over the flood presideth, Preside, I say, doth Jehovah [as]
   King for ever.

   11 Jehovah strength to his people will give; Jehovah will bless his
   people with peace.

   PSALM 30

   A Psalm of a Song at the dedication of the house of David

   1 I will exalt thee, O Jehovah! for thou hast raised me up, And hast
   not made glad my enemies over me.

   2 O Jehovah, my God! I have cried to thee, And thou hast healed me.

   3 O Jehovah! thou hast brought up from the grove my soul; Thou hast
   quickened me from among those who descend into the pit.

   4 Sing to Jehovah, O ye his meek ones! And acknowledge the memorial of
   his holiness.

   5 For there is only a moment in his anger, But life in his favor: In
   the evening will lodge weeping, And in the morning shall come
   exultation.

   6 But as for me I had said in my tranquillity, "I shall not be moved
   for ever."

   7 O Jehovah! in thy good pleasure Thou hast established strength to my
   mountain; Thou didst hide thy face, I was confounded.

   8 O Jehovah! to thee I cried, And to my Lord I made supplication.

   9 What profit shall there be in my blood, When I descend into the pit?
   Celebrate thee shall the dust? Shall it proclaim thy truth?

   10 Hear, O Jehovah! and have mercy upon me; O Jehovah! be thou a helper
   to me.

   11 Thou hast turned my mourning into dancing for me; Thou hast loosed
   my sackcloth, And girded me with gladness.

   12 That celebrate thee in psalms may my glory, and not be silent: O
   Jehovah, my God! for ever will I celebrate thee.

   PSALM 31

   To the Chief Musician,. A Psalm of David

   1 In thee, O Jehovah! have I trusted, Let me not be put to shame for
   ever: In thy righteousness deliver me.

   2 Incline to me thy ear, Speedily do thou rescue me; Be to me for a
   rock of strength, For a house of defense to save me.

   3 For my rock, and my fortress art thou: And for the sake of thy name
   thou wilt direct and guide me.

   4 Extricate me from the net, which they have hidden for me, For thou
   art my strength.

   5 Into thy hand I will commend my spirit; For thou hast redeemed me, O
   Jehovah! God of truth.

   6 I hate all those who regard lying vanities; But as for me in Jehovah
   I have trusted.

   7 I will exult and rejoice in thy goodness; Because thou hast looked
   upon my affliction: Thou hast known in distresses my soul:

   8 And thou hast not shut me up in the hand of the enemy: But thou hast
   set at large my feet.

   9 Have pity upon me, O Jehovah! for trouble is to me: My eye hath
   consumed away for vexation; my soul and my belly.

   10 My life hath riffled through grid; And my years with groaning: My
   strength hath sunk through my sorrow, And my bones have moldered away.

   11 On account of all my enemies I was a reproach, Yea to my neighbors
   exceedingly, And a terror to my acquaintances; And those who saw me
   abroad fled from me.

   12 I was forgotten as a dead man from the heart; I became like a vessel
   [that is] broken.

   13 For I have heard the slander of many: Fear hath seized me on every
   side, While they consult together against me, And to take away my life
   do devise.

   14 But as for me, in thee have I trusted, O Jehovah! I have said, "My
   God art thou."

   15 In thy hand are my times; Rescue me from the hand of my enemies, And
   from those who persecute me.

   16 Cause to shine upon thy servant thy face, Save me in thy goodness.

   17 O Jehovah! let me not be put to shame, For I have called upon thee:
   Let the wicked be put to shame, Let Gem be silent in the grave.

   18 Let the lips of lying be put to shame, Which speak against the
   righteous a hard thing in pride and scorn.

   19 How great is thy goodness, Which thou hast hidden for those who fear
   thee! Which thou hast performed for those who confide in thee, Before
   the sons of men!

   20 Thou shalt hide them in the hidden place of thy presence, From the
   prides of man; Thou shalt conceal them as in a tent, From the strife of
   tongues.

   21 Blessed be Jehovah! For he hath made wonderful his goodness towards
   me, As in a city fortified.

   22 But as for me, I had said in my fear, "I am cast away from before
   thy eyes:" Yet truly thou hast heard the voice of my supplications,
   When I cried unto thee.

   23 Love Jehovah, all ye meek ones of his! The faithful preserve doth
   Jehovah, And he repayeth plentifully him who behaveth proudly.

   24 Be of good courage, and he shall strengthen your heart, All ye who
   hope in Jehovah.

   PSALM 32

   Of David. Giving instruction

   1 Blessed are those to whom is remitted iniquity, And whose
   transgression is covered.

   2 Blessed is the man to whom Jehovah doth not impute iniquity, And in
   whose spirit there is not guile.

   3 When I kept silence, waste away did my bones, And when I wailed all
   the day.

   4 For by day and night heavy upon me was thy hand; Turned into the
   drought of summer was my greenness. Selah.

   5 My sin I have acknowledged to thee, And my iniquity I have not hid. I
   said, "I will confess against myself my wickedness to Jehovah;" And
   thou didst remit the guilt of my sin. Selah.

   6 On this account, pray to thee shall every man, that is meek, In the
   time of finding thee: So that in a flood of many waters, To him they
   shall not come near.

   7 Thou art a hiding-place to me; From trouble thou shalt preserve me;
   With songs of deliverance thou shalt encompass me. Selah.

   8 I will instruct thee, And teach thee the way wherein thou shouldest
   walk: I will counsel thee with mine eye.

   9 Be ye not like a horse, or like a mule, Which have not understanding:
   With bit and bridle his jaws thou shalt bind, Lest they kick against
   thee.

   10 Many sorrows shall be to the wicked: But the man who hopeth in
   Jehovah goodness shall encompass.

   11 Rejoice in Jehovah, and exult, ye righteous! Sing all ye who are
   upright in heart.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 33

   1 Exult, ye righteous! in Jehovah: For to the upright comely is praise.

   2 Celebrate Jehovah upon the harp; Upon the nablure, [321] and
   instrument of ten strings, sing psalms to him

   3 Sing to him a song that is new; Ardently sing with shouting.

   4 For right is the word of Jehovah, And all his works are in
   faithfulness.

   5 He loveth righteousness and judgment: Of the goodness of Jehovah fill
   is the earth.

   6 By the word of Jehovah the heavens were established, And by the
   breath of his mouth all their host.

   7 He gathered together as an heap the waters of the sea; He laid up as
   in treasure houses the deeps.

   8 Let all the earth fear Jehovah; Of him let all the inhabitants of the
   world stand in awe.

   9 For he spake, and it was; He commanded, and it stood.

   10 Jehovah scattereth the counsel of the Gentiles, He rendereth
   fruitless the imaginations of the peoples.

   11 The counsel of Jehovah for ever shall stand, The thoughts of his
   heart from age to age.

   12 Blessed is the people to whom Jehovah is their God, The people whom
   he hath chosen for: in inheritance to himself.

   13 From heavens looked down hath Jehovah, He hath beheld all the sons
   of Adam.

   14 From the dwelling place of His throne, He hath looked on all the
   inhabitants of the earth.

   15 He who hath fashioned together their hearts, Who understandeth all
   their works.

   16 There is not a king saved by the multitude of an host, Nor a giant
   rescued by greatness of strength.

   17 Fallacious is a horse for safety, And by the greatness of his
   strength he will not deliver.

   18 Behold! the eye of Jehovah is upon those who fear him, [Upon those]
   who hope in his mercy;

   19 To rescue from death their souls, To keep them alive in famine.

   20 Our soul waiteth for Jehovah: Our help and our shield is he.

   21 Surely in him rejoice shall our heart, Because in his holy name we
   will trust.

   22 Let thy mercy be upon us, O Jehovah! According as we have trusted in
   thee.

   PSALM 34

   Of David when he changed his countenance before Abimelech, who expelled
   him, and he departed

   1 I will bless Jehovah at all times: Continually his praise shall be in
   my mouth.

   2 In Jehovah make her boast shall my soul: Hear shall the humble and be
   glad.

   3 Magnify? Jehovah with me, And let us exalt his name together.

   4 I sought. Jehovah, and he answered me, And from all my fears he
   delivered me.

   5 They shall look to him, and shall flow to him, And their faces shall
   not he ashamed.

   6 This poor man cried,: and Jehovah heard him, And from all his
   distresses saved him.

   7 Encamp doth the angel of Jehovah about those who fear him, And will
   deliver them.

   8 Taste ye and see that good is Jehovah: Blessed is the man who
   trusteth in him.

   9 Fear Jehovah, ye saints of his; For nothing is lacking to those who
   fear him.

   10 The young lions suffer want and are famished: But those who fear
   Jehovah shall not want any good thing.

   11 Come ye children, hearken to me, The fear of Jehovah I will teach
   you.

   12 Who is the man that desireth life, Loving days in which he may see
   good?

   13 Keep thy tongue from evil, And thy lips from speaking deceit.

   14 Depart from evil, and do good; Seek peace, and pursue it.

   15 The eyes of Jehovah are upon the righteous, And his ears [are open]
   to their cry.

   16 The face of Jehovah is upon those who do evil, To blot out from the
   earth their remembrance.

   17 They cried, and Jehovah heard them, And from all their distresses he
   delivered them.

   18 Near is Jehovah to the broken in heart; The contrite in spirit he
   will save.

   19 Many are the afflictions of the righteous; But from them all deliver
   him will Jehovah.

   20 He keepeth all his bones: One of them is not broken.

   21 That malice shall slay the wicked, And those who hate the righteous
   shall be destroyed.

   22 Redeem doth, Jehovah the soul of his servants, And they shall not
   perish who confide in him.

   PSALM 35

   Of David

   1 Plead, O Jehovah! with those who plead with me, Fight against those
   who fight against me.

   2 Lay hold on shield and buckler, And rise up to my aid.

   3 Draw out the spear, and stop my ears against my persecutors: Say to
   my soul, "Thy salvation am I."

   4 Let those be confounded and put to shame Who seek my soul, Let those
   be turned back and be abashed Who devise my hurt.

   5 Let them be as chaff before the wind? And let the angel of Jehovah
   drive them.

   6 Let their way be darkness and slipperiness; And let the angel of
   Jehovah pursue them:

   7 For without a cause they have hid for me the pitfall of their net,
   [322] Without a cause they have digged a pit for my soul.

   8 Let there come upon him confusion of which he is not aware; And let
   the net which he hath hidden catch him; With confusion let him fall
   into it.

   9 And my soul hath exulted in Jehovah, It shall rejoice in his
   salvation.

   10 All my bones shall say, "O Jehovah! who is like to thee, "Rescuing
   the poor from him who is too strong for him, "The poor and wretched
   from his spoiler?"

   11 Rise up do witnesses [that are] violent; Things which I have not
   known they ask me.

   12 They repay me evil for good, To the bereaving of my soul.

   13 But as for me, in their sickness my clothing was sackcloth: I
   afflicted by fasting my soul; And my prayer upon my own bosom was
   turned.

   14 As if he had been a friend, as if a brother to me, I behaved myself
   towards him: As he who mourneth heavily for his mother I humbled
   myself.

   15 But they at my halting rejoiced, they were assembled together:
   Assembled together, I say, against me, were the abjects whom I had not
   known: They have torn with their lips and have not been silent.

   16 Among perfidious jesters at feasts, They gnash upon me with their
   teeth.

   17 O Lord! how long wilt thou behold it? Rescue my soul from their
   violence, From the lions my only one.

   18 I will celebrate thee in the congregation great: Among people many I
   will praise thee.

   19 Let not those rejoice over me, who unjustly are my enemies; Nor let
   those who hate me without a cause wink with the eye.

   20 For peace they speak not;

   21 They have opened against me their mouth; They have said, "Aha! aha!
   seen it hath our eye."

   22 Thou hast seen it also, O Jehovah: Be not silent, O Lord! be not far
   from me.

   23 Arouse thyself, and awake for my judgment, My God! and my Lord! to
   my cause.

   24 Judge me according to thy righteousness, O Jehovah, my God! And let
   them not rejoice over me.

   25 Let them not say in their heart, "Aha! our soul!" Let them not say
   "We have destroyed him."

   26 Let those be ashamed and confounded together, Who rejoice at my
   calamity; Let those be clothed with shame and ignominy, Who magnify
   themselves against me.

   27 But let those shout and rejoice, who favor my righteousness: And let
   them say continually, "Magnified be Jehovah! "Who loveth the peace of
   his servant."

   28 And my tongue shall speak of thy righteousness; All the day of thy
   praise.

   PSALM 36

   To the Chief Musician. Of the servant of Jehovah, [even] of David

   1 Ungodliness saith to the wicked man in the midst of my heart, There
   is no fear of God before his eyes.

   2 For he flattereth himself in his own eyes, Until his iniquity be
   found to be hateful.

   3 The words of his mouth are iniquity and deceit, He teaseth to
   understand that he may do good.

   4 Iniquity he meditates upon his bed; He setteth himself in a way not
   good; Evil he doth not abhor.

   5 O Jehovah! unto the heavens is thy mercy, Thy truth even unto the
   clouds.

   6 Thy justice is like the great mountains, Thy judgments are a great
   deep. Man and beast, thou preservest, O Jehovah!

   7 How precious is thy loving-kindness, O God! Therefore the sons of men
   in the shadow of thy wings shall trust.

   8 They shall be fully satisfied with the fatness of thy house; And of
   the river of thy pleasures thou shalt cause them to drink.

   9 For with thee is the fountain of life, And in thy light shall we see
   light.

   10 Extend thy mercy to those who know thee, And thy righteousness to
   the upright in heart.

   11 Let not the foot of pride come upon me; And the hand of the ungodly
   let it not remove me.

   12 There fallen are the workers of iniquity; They are thrust down and
   shall not be able to stand. [323]

   PSALM 37

   Of David

   1 Vex not thyself because of the wicked, Nor be envious on account of
   the workers of iniquity.

   2 For like the grass quickly shall they be cut down; And as the green
   herb they shall wither.

   3 Trust thou in Jehovah, and do good; Dwell in the land, and be fed in
   truth.

   4 And delight in Jehovah, And he will grant thee the request of thy
   heart.

   5 Devolve upon Jehovah thy ways, And trust in him, and he will bring it
   to pass.

   6 And he will bring forth as the light thy righteousness, And thy
   judgments as the noonday.

   7 Be silent to Jehovah, and wait for him; Vex not thyself at him who
   prospereth in his way, At the man who committeth wickedness.

   8 Cease from anger, forsake wrath, Vex not thyself so as to commit sin.

   9 For the wicked shall be cut off; But those who wait for Jehovah shall
   inherit the earth.

   10 Yet a little while, and the ungodly shall not be; And thou shalt
   give attention to his place, and shalt not find him

   11 But the meek ones shall inherit the earth, And shall be delighted in
   the abundance of peace.

   12 Plot doth the ungodly against the righteous, And gnasheth against
   him with his teeth.

   13 The Lord shall laugh at him, For he seeth that coming is his day.

   14 Their sword draw do the ungodly, And their bow they bend, To lay
   prostrate the poor and needy, To slay those who are upright in the way.

   15 But their sword shall enter into their own heart, And their bow
   shall be broken.

   16 Better is a little to the righteous man, Than the wealth of the
   ungodly who are great.

   17 For the arms of the ungodly shall be broken; But Jehovah sustaineth
   the righteous.

   18 Know doth Jehovah the days of the upright, And their inheritance for
   ever shall be.

   19 They shall not be put to shame in the time of adversity; And in the
   days of famine they shall be satisfied.

   20 For the ungodly shall perish, And the enemies of Jehovah like the
   fattest of lambs shall be consumed; Into smoke they shall be consumed.;

   21 Borrow doth the ungodly man, and doth not repay; But the righteous
   man is compassionate and giveth.

   22 For those who are blessed of him shall inherit the earth, And those
   who are cursed of him shall be cut off.

   23 By Jehovah the steps of a man are directed, And his way he will
   love.

   24 When he shall fall he shall not be bruised, For Jehovah putteth
   under [him] his hand.

   25 Young I have been, I have also grown old; And yet I have not seen
   the righteous man forsaken, Nor his seed begging for bread.

   26 Daily he is compassionate and lendeth, And his seed is for blessing.

   27 Depart from evil and do good, And dwell for ever.

   28 For Jehovah loveth judgment, And doth not forsake his meek ones; For
   ever shall they be preserved: And the seed of the ungodly shall be cut
   off.

   29 The righteous shall inherit the earth, And shall dwell for ever upon
   it.

   30 The mouth of the righteous shall speak wisdom;

   31 The law of his God is in his heart; Slide not shall his steps.

   32 Watch doth the ungodly the righteous man, And seeketh to put him to
   death.

   33 Jehovah will not leave him in his hand, Nor condemn him when he is
   judged.

   34 Wait for Jehovah, and keep his way, And he shall exalt thee to
   inherit the earth: When the ungodly shall be cut off thou shalt see it.

   35 I have seen the ungodly man robust, [324] And spreading himself like
   a green bay tree;

   36 And he passed away, and to I he was not; And I sought for his place,
   and he was not found.

   37 Mark the perfect man, and consider the upright; For the end of such
   a man is peace.

   38 But transgressors shall be destroyed together: The end of the
   ungodly shall be cut off.

   39 But the salvation of the righteous is from Jehovah: He will be their
   strength in the time of trouble.

   40 And help them shall Jehovah, and deliver them: He shall deliver them
   from the wicked: He shall save them, because they trust in him.

   PSALM 38

   A Psalm of David: to bring to remembrance

   1 O Jehovah! do not in thy fury rebuke me, And in thy wrath do not
   chasten me.

   2 For thy arrows go down in me, And descend upon me doth thy hand.

   3 There is no soundness in my flesh, because of thy wrath, Nor peace in
   my bones because of my sin.

   4 For my iniquities have passed over my head, Like a burden that is
   weighty, they are too heavy for me.

   5 Putrid [and] corrupt have my wounds become, Because of my
   foolishness.

   6 I am bowed down, I am brought low exceedingly; Day by day a mourner I
   do walk:

   7 For my reins are filled with a burning heat; Nor is there soundness
   in my flesh.

   8 I am enfeebled and broken exceedingly: I have roared through the
   disquietude of my heart.

   9 O Lord! before thee is all my desire, And my groaning from thee is
   not hidden,

   10 My heart hath throbbed, forsaken me hath my strength; And the light
   of my eyes, it also is gone from me.

   11 My friends and my companions aloof from my stroke have stood, And my
   kinsmen afar off have stood.

   12 And they have laid snares who sought for my soul; Arid those who
   sought my hurt have threatened mischiefs; And deceits daily do they
   meditate.

   13 But as for me, like a deaf man I hear not; And I am like a dumb man
   who openeth not his mouth.

   14 And I was as a man who doth not hear, And in whose mouth there are
   no reproofs.

   15 For on thee, O Jehovah! do I wait: Thou wilt answer me, O Lord, my
   God!

   16 For I said, "Lest they should rejoice over me:" At the slipping of
   my foot against me they magnified themselves,

   17 Surely as for me I am ready to halt; And my sorrow is before me
   continually.

   18 Surely my iniquity I declare; I am in consternation because of my
   sin.

   19 But my enemies are living; [325] they are strong; And those are
   become mighty who hate me wrongfully.

   20 And they who requite me evil for good are against me, Because I
   follow [what is] good.

   21 Forsake me not, O Jehovah, my God! Be not far from me.

   22 Hasten to my help, O Lord, my salvation!

   PSALM 39

   To the Chief Musician, Jeduthun. A Psalm of David

   1 I said "I will take heed to my ways, "That I sin not with my tongue:
   "I will keep my mouth with a muzzle, "While the ungodly man standeth
   before me."

   2 I was dumb not uttering a word; I held my peace [even] from good; And
   my sorrow was stirred.

   3 My heart became hot within me; In my musing a fire did burn; I spake
   with my tongue.

   4 Cause me to know, O Jehovah! my end, And the number of my days, That
   I may know of what duration I am.

   5 Behold! as an handbreadth thou hast made my days, And my duration is
   as nothing before thee: Surely altogether vanity is every mart while he
   standeth.

   6 Surely in a shadow man walketh; [Selah. Surely in vain is he
   disquieted: They heap together, and know not who shall gather.

   7 And now what do I wait for, O Lord? My hope is towards thee.

   8 From all my sins deliver thou me: The reproach of the foolish make me
   not.

   9 I was dumb; I will not open my mouth, Because thou hast done it.

   10 Remove from me thy stroke: By the blow of thy hand I have failed.

   11 With rebukes for iniquity thou chastisest man; And causest to waste
   away as a moth his beauty: Surely vanity is every man. Selah.

   12 Hear my prayer, O Jehovah! And to my cry give ear; At my tears be
   not silent; For a stranger am I before thee, A sojourner like all my
   fathers.

   13 Let me alone, that I may recover strength, Before I depart and be no
   more.

   PSALM 40

   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David

   1 I have patiently waited for Jehovah, And he inclined to me, and heard
   my cry.

   2 And he drew me out of the roaring pit, Out of the mire of clay, And
   set upon a rock my feet; He hath established my steps.

   3 And he hath put in my mouth a song [that is] new, Even praise to our
   God: See shall many and shall fear, And shall trust in Jehovah.

   4 Blessed is the man who maketh Jehovah his confidence, And hath not
   respected the proud, Nor those who turn aside to lying.

   5 Many, O Jehovah, my God! are thy wonderful works which thou hast
   done; And thy thoughts towards us it is impossible to reckon up in
   order to thee: I will declare and speak [of them;] [But] they are more
   than can be told.

   6 Sacrifice and oblation thou hast not taken pleasure in: But my ears
   hast thou made fit: [326] Burnt-offering and sin-offering thou hast not
   required.

   7 Then I said, "Behold! I come; "In the volume of the book it is
   written of me,

   8 "That I may do thy pleasure, O my God! "I have desired to do it, "And
   thy law is in the midst of my bowels."

   9 I have proclaimed thy righteousness in the assembly great: Behold my
   lips I will not restrain; O Jehovah! thou knowest it.

   10 Thy righteousness I have not hidden within my heart; Thy truth and
   thy salvation I have declared: I have not concealed thy goodness and
   thy truth in the assembly great.

   11 O thou, Jehovah! withhold not thy compassions from me; Let thy
   goodness and thy truth continually preserve me.

   12 For encompassed me have evils innumerable; Laid hold upon me have my
   iniquities, yea in so great number that I cannot see them: They are
   more in number than the hairs of my head; And my heart hath failed me.

   13 Let it please thee, O Jehovah! to deliver me; O Jehovah! to my aid
   make haste.

   14 Let them be put to shame and confounded together Who seek after my
   soul to destroy it; Let them be turned backward and put to shame Who
   seek after my hurt.

   15 Let them be destroyed for a reward of their shame, Who have said to
   me, "Aha! aha!"

   16 Let all those exult and rejoice in thee who seek thee; And let those
   say continually, "May Jehovah be magnified" -- "Those who love thy
   salvation.

   17 But as for me I am poor and needy. Jehovah hath regarded me; My help
   and my deliverer art thou: O thou, my God! delay not.

   PSALM 41

   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David

   1 Blessed is he who judgeth wisely of the poor: In the day of evil
   Jehovah will deliver him.

   2 Jehovah will keep him, and preserve him alive: He shall be blessed
   upon the earth: And thou will not give him up to the desire of his
   enemies.

   3 Jehovah will support him upon the bed of sorrow: All his bed thou
   hast turned in his sickness.

   4 I have said, "O Jehovah! have mercy upon me; " "Heal my soul, for I
   have sinned against thee."

   5 My enemies have spoken evil of me, "When will he die, and perish
   shall his name?"

   6 And if he come to see me falsely doth he speak; His heart gathereth
   iniquity to itself': When he goeth abroad he speaketh [it.]

   7 Together against me do all my haters whisper; Against me do they
   devise evil for me, [saying,]

   8 "An evil deed of Belial cleaveth fast to him; "And he who lieth shall
   not rise again."

   9 Even the man of my peace in whom I trusted, Who eateth of my bread,
   hath lifted up against me the heel.

   10 Do thou then, O Jehovah! have mercy upon me; Raise me up, and I will
   recompense them.

   11 By this I have known that I have been acceptable to thee, Because my
   enemy shall not triumph over me.

   12 And as for me, in my integrity thou wilt uphold me, And wilt
   establish me before thy face for ever.

   13 Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, For ever and ever. Amen and
   Amen.

   PSALM 42

   To the Chief Musician. A lesson of instruction to the Sons of Korah

   1 As the hart crieth for the fountains of waters, So my soul crieth for
   thee, O God!

   2 Thirsted hath my soul for God, for the living God: When shall I come
   to appear before the face of God?

   3 To me have my tears been for bread, by day and night, While it is
   said to me daily, "Where is thy God?"

   4 When these things I remember, I pour out within me my soul, Because I
   had gone with the procession, Leading them even to the house of God,
   With the voice of exultation and praise, -- The multitude dancing for
   joy.

   5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul! And why art thou disquieted within
   me? Wait thou for God; for I shall yet give him thanks, [For] the
   salvations of his countenance.

   6 O my God! my soul within me is cast down, When I remember thee from
   the land of Jordan and of Hermonim, From the mountain Mizar.

   7 Deep unto deep calleth at the noise of thy waterspouts: All thy waves
   and all thy billows over me have gone.

   8 By day command will Jehovah his loving-kindness, And by night his
   song shall be with me, And prayer to the God of my life.

   9 I will say to God, my Rock, "Why hast thou forgotten me? "Why
   mourning do I go because of the oppression of my enemy?"

   10 [It is as] a wound in my bones when my enemies reproach me, Saying
   to me daily, "Where is thy God?"

   11 Why art thou cast down, O my soul? And why art thou disquieted
   within me? Hope in God; for I shall yet give thanks to him, The
   salvations of my countenance, and my God.

   PSALM 43

   1 Judge me, O God! and plead my cause: From a people without mercy,
   from a man deceitful and wicked deliver me.

   2 For thou art the God of my strength; Why art thou estranged from me?
   Why mourning do I go because of the oppression of the enemy?

   3 Send forth thy light and thy truth; Let them direct me, let them
   conduct me, To the mountain of thy holiness, and to thy tabernacles.

   4 And I will go to the altar of God, To the God of the joy of my
   rejoicing; And I will celebrate thee upon the harp, O God, my God!

   5 Why art thou cast down, O my soul! And why art thou disquieted within
   me? Hope in God, for I shall yet celebrate him, Who is the salvation of
   my countenance and my God.

   PSALM 44

   To the Chief Musician. Of the sons of Korah. Giving instruction

   1 O God! with our ears we have heard, Our fathers have told us, The
   work which thou hast done in their days, In the days of old.

   2 Thou with thy hand hast expelled the heathen, and planted them: Thou
   hast wasted the peoples and multiplied them:

   3 For not by their own sword acquired they the land, And their own arm
   did not save them; But thy right hand and thy arm, and the light of thy
   countenance, Because thou wast favorable to them.

   4 Thou, even thou, art my King; O God! command salvations for Jacob.

   5 Through thee our adversaries with the horn we have pushed; In thy
   name we have trampled under foot those who rise up against us.

   6 For not in my bow will I trust, And my sword will not save me.

   7 Surely thou hast saved us from our enemies, And our haters thou hast
   put to shame.

   8 In God we will boast all the day, And thy name for ever shall we
   praise. Selah.

   9 Nevertheless thou hast abhorred us and put us to shame, And thou
   goest not forth any more with our armies.

   10 Thou hast made us to turn back from him that afflicteth us, And our
   haters have spoiled us for themselves.

   11 Thou hast given us as sheep for food; And among the heathen thou
   hast scattered us.

   12 Thou hast sold thy people, and not become rich, And thou hast not
   increased the price of them.

   13 Thou hast made us a reproach to our neighbors, A scorn and derision
   to those who are round about us.

   14 Thou hast made us a byword among the heathen, A shaking of the head
   among the peoples.

   15 Daily is my reproach before me, And the shame of my face hath quite
   covered me,

   16 Because of the voice of him who reproacheth and revileth, Because of
   the face of the adversary and avenger.

   17 All this is come upon us, and we have not forgotten thee, Nor dealt
   perfidiously in thy covenant;

   18 Not turned back hath our heart, Nor declined have our steps from thy
   path.

   19 Although thou hast crushed us in the place of dragons, And covered
   us with the shadow of death.

   20 If we have forgotten the name of our God, And have spread forth our
   hands to a God that is strange;

   21 Shall not God search out this? For he knoweth the secrets of the
   heart.

   22 Surely for thy sake we are killed daily; We are accounted as sheep
   [appointed] for slaughter.

   23 Arise, why sleepest thou, O Lord? Awake, do not forget us for ever.

   24 Wherefore thy face dost thou hide? Wilt thou forget our misery and
   our affliction?

   25 For humbled to the dust is our soul; Cleave to the earth doth our
   belly.

   26 Arise for our help, And redeem us for the sake of thy
   loving-kindness.

   PSALM 45

   To the Chief Musician. Upon the lilies. Of the sons of Korah. Giving
   instruction. A Song of loves

   1 Boiling over is my heart to speak a goodly theme, Speak shall I
   myself of my works concerning the King: My tongue is as the pen of a
   swift writer.

   2 Thou art fair above the sons of men; Diffused is grace on thy lips;
   Because God hath blessed thee for ever.

   3 Gird thy sword upon thy thigh, O mighty one! With majesty and glory.

   4 And in thy majesty prosper thou; Ride forth upon the word of truth,
   and meekness and righteousness; And thy right hand shall teach thee
   terrible things:

   5 Thy arrows are sharp (so that the people fall under thee) In the
   hearts of the enemies of the king.

   6 Thy throne, O God! is for ever and ever; The scepter of rectitude is
   the scepter of thy kingdom.

   7 Thou lovest righteousness and hatest impiety; Because anointed thee
   hath God, thy God, With the oil of gladness above thy fellows.

   8 Myrrh, and aloes and cassia [are] in all thy garments, Out of the
   ivory palaces, whence they have made thee glad.

   9 The daughters of kings [were] among thy maids of honor; Stand did thy
   consort at thy right hand in gold of Ophir.

   10 Hearken, O daughter! and consider and incline thy ear; And forget
   thy people, and the house of thy father.

   11 And enamored shall be the King with thy beauty; For he is thy Lord,
   and thou shalt worship him.

   12 And the daughter of Tyre [shall come] with a present; Thy favor
   entreat shall the rich among the people.

   13 All glorious is the daughter of the King within; Of garments
   embroidered with gold is her clothing.

   14 In raiment of needle-work she shall be brought to the King; Her
   virgins that follow her, her companions shall be brought to thee.

   15 They shall be brought with joy and exultation; They shall enter into
   the palace of the King.

   16 Instead of thy fathers shall be thy children; Thou shalt make them
   princes in all the earth.

   17 I will make thy name to be remembered throughout all generation;
   Therefore celebrate thee shall the peoples for ever and ever.

   PSALM 46

   To the Chief Musician. Of the sons of Korah. Upon Alamoth. A Song

   1 God is to us a protection and strength; A help in troubles he is
   found exceedingly.

   2 Therefore we will not fear when moved shall be the earth, And fall
   shall the mountains into the heart of the sea.

   3 [When] roar and rage tempestuously shall the waters thereof; [When]
   shake shall the mountains with the swelling thereof. Selah.

   4 The streams of her river shall make glad the city of God, The
   Sanctuary of the tabernacles of the Most High.

   5 God is in the midst of her; she shall not be moved: Help her will God
   at the dawn of the morning.

   6 Rage did the peoples, moved were the kingdoms: He uttered his voice,
   melt did the earth.

   7 Jehovah of armies is with us; A fortress for us is the God of Jacob.
   Selah.

   8 Come ye, consider the works of Jehovah, What desolations he hath
   wrought in the earth.

   9 He maketh to cease battles, even to the ends of the earth; He
   breaketh the bow, he shattereth in pieces the arms; The chariot he
   burneth with fire.

   10 Be still and know that I am God: I will be exalted among the
   heathen; I will be exalted in the earth.

   11 Jehovah of armies is with us; A fortress for us is the God of Jacob.
   Selah.

   PSALM 47

   To the Chief Musician. Of the sons of Korah. Upon Alamoth. A Song

   1 O all ye peoples! clap the hand; Shout unto God with the voice of
   exultation;

   2 For Jehovah is high, terrible, A great king over all the earth.

   3 He hath put in order the people under us, And the nations under our
   feet.

   4 He hath chosen for us our inheritance, The glory of Jacob, whom he
   hath loved. Selah.

   5 Gone up is God with a shout, Jehovah with the sound of a trumpet.

   6 Sing psalms to God, sing psalms; Sing psalms to our King, sing
   psalms;

   7 For king of all the earth is God; Sing praises, all ye who
   understand!

   8 The kingdom he hath obtained over the heathen; God sitteth upon the
   throne of his holiness.

   9 The princes of the peoples are assembled together To the people of
   the God of Abraham: For to God belong the shields of the earth: He is
   greatly exalted.

   PSALM 48

   A Song of a Psalm. Of the sons of Korah

   1 Great is Jehovah and to be praised greatly In the city of our God, in
   the mountain of his holiness.

   2 Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, The mountain of
   Zion, on the sides of the north, The city of the great King.

   3 God in her palaces is known for a defense.

   4 For behold! the kings assembled, They passed away together.

   5 They themselves saw, so they marveled; They were frightened, they
   fled precipitately,

   6 Fear seized upon them there, Pain as of one in travail.

   7 By the east wind thou breakest in pieces the ships of Tarshish.

   8 As we have heard, so have we seen In the city of Jehovah of Hosts, In
   the city of our God: God will establish it for ever. Selah

   9 We have waited, O God! for thy mercy In the midst of thy temple,

   10 As is thy name, O God! So is thy praise unto the ends of the earth:
   Of righteousness full is thy right hand.

   11 Rejoice shall Mount Zion, Exult shall the daughters of Judah,
   Because of thy judgments.

   12 Encompass Zion, and walk round about her. Number the towers thereof,

   13 Set your heart to her walls, Exalt her towers, That ye may make
   report to the generations to come.

   14 For this God is our God for ever and ever: He will be our guide even
   unto death.

   PSALM 49

   To the Chief Musician. Of the sons of Korah. A Psalm

   1 Hear this all ye peoples; Give ear all ye inhabitants of the world:

   2 Both ye sons of Adam, and ye sons of men, Rich and poor together.

   3 My mouth shall speak of wisdoms, And the meditation of my heart is of
   understanding.

   4 I will incline to a parable my ear: I will open upon the harp my
   enigma.

   5 Wherefore should I fear in the days of evil? The iniquity of my heel
   shall compass me about.

   6 They trust in their wealth, And in the multitude of their riches do
   glory.

   7 The brother shall not be able to redeem; None shall give to God the
   price of his redemption.

   8 And precious shall be the redemption of their soul, And their
   continuance for ever:

   9 That he should still live for ever, And not see the grave.

   10 For he shall see that wise men die, Together the fool and the
   brutish person shall perish, And leave to strangers their wealth.

   11 Their inward thought is [how to make] their houses [to continue] for
   ever, Their dwelling-places from generation to generation: They have
   called out their names upon the earth.

   12 And man in honor shall not abide; He hath become like the beasts:
   they perish.

   13 This their way is foolishness in them, And their posterity in their
   saying will acquiesce. Selah.

   14 Like sleep in the grave they are laid; Death shall feed them; And
   have dominion over them shall the upright in the morning, And their
   strength shall wax old; The grave shall receive them from their
   dwelling.

   15 But God shall redeem my soul from the hand of the grave; For he hath
   taken me up. Selah.

   16 Be not thou afraid when a man shall become rich, When increased
   shall be the glory of his house;

   17 For he shall not at his death carry all away: Descend not after him
   shall his glory:

   18 For his soul in his lifetime he will bless, And they shall praise
   thee when thou doest well to thyself.

   19 He shall come to the age of his fathers, Even for ever he shall not
   see the light.

   20 Man is in honor, and will not understand: He hath become like the
   beasts: they shall perish.

   PSALM 50

   A Song, of Asaph

   1 The God of gods, Jehovah hath spoken, And called the earth From the
   rising of the sun unto the going down thereof.

   2 Out of Zion, the Perfection of beauty, God hath shined.

   3 Come shall our God, and shall not keep silence; A fire before him
   shall devour, And round about him a tempest shall rage exceedingly.

   4 He shall call to the heavens from above, And to the earth, to judge
   his people.

   5 "Gather together to me my meek ones, (will he say), "Those who strike
   a covenant with me over sacrifices."

   6 And declare shall the heavens his righteousness: For God is judge
   himself. Selah.

   7 "Hear, O my people! and I will speak; "O Israel! and I will announce
   to thee: "God, [even] thy God am I.

   8 "Not for thy sacrifices will I reprove thee; "And thy burnt-offerings
   are before me continually.

   9 "I will not take out of thy house a calf, "Nor out of thy folds
   he-goats:

   10 "For mine are all the beasts of the forest, "The cattle upon a
   thousand hills.

   11 "I know all the birds of the mountains; "And the wild beasts of the
   field are at my command.

   12 "If I am hungry, I will not tell thee: "For mine is the world and
   the fullness thereof.

   13 "Will I eat the flesh of bulls, "And the blood of goats will I
   drink?

   14 "Sacrifice unto God praise, "And pay unto the Most High thy vows.

   15 "Call upon me in the day of trouble; "I will deliver thee, and thou
   shalt glorify me.

   16 "But unto the wicked said hath God, "What hast thou to do to declare
   my statutes, "[Or] that thou shouldest take my covenant into thy lips?

   17 "Also thou hatest correction, "And castest my words behind thee.

   18 "If thou seest a thief, thou wilt run with him, "And with adulterers
   is thy portion.

   19 "Thy mouth thou puttest forth to evil, "And thy tongue frameth
   deceit,

   20 "Thou wilt sit against thy brother; "Thou wilt speak against the
   sons of thy mother; "Thou wilt set forth slander.

   21 "These things thou hast done, and I kept silence; "Thou thoughtest
   that I would be like thyself': "I will reprove thee, and set them in
   order before thine eyes.

   22 "Now consider this, ye who forget God, "Lest I seize upon you and
   there be none to deliver.

   23 "He who sacrificeth praise will glorify me: "And he who ordereth his
   way to him will I show the salvation of God."

   PSALM 51

   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David, when Nathan the prophet came
   to him, after he had gone in to Bathsheba

   1 Have pity upon me, O God! according to thy mercy; According to the
   multitude of thy compassions blot out my iniquities.

   2 Multiply to wash me from my sin, And from my wickedness do thou
   cleanse me.

   3 For my sins I know, And my wickedness is before me continually.

   4 Against thee, against thee only, have I sinned, And that which was
   displeasing in thy sight have I done; That thou mayest be justified
   when thou speakest, And be pure in giving judgment.

   5 Behold in iniquity I was born, And in sin conceive me did my mother.

   6 Behold, truth thou hast loved in the inmost parts, And in secret,
   wisdom thou hast made me know.

   7 Thou shalt purge me with hyssop, and I shall be clean; Thou shalt
   wash me, and I shall be whiter than snow.

   8 Make me to hear joy and gladness; And exult shall the bones which
   thou hast broken.

   9 Hide thy face from my sins, And all my iniquities blot out.

   10 A heart [that is] clean create in me, O God! And a spirit [that is]
   right renew in my inward parts.

   11 Cast me not away from thy face, And the Spirit of thy holiness take
   not from me.

   12 Restore to me the joy of thy salvation, And with a free spirit
   uphold me.

   13 I will teach transgressors thy ways, the ungodly to time shall be
   converted.

   14 Deliver me from bloods, O God! O God of my salvation! And sing aloud
   shall my tongue of thy righteousness.

   15 O Lord! my lips do thou open, And my mouth shall show forth thy
   praise.

   16 For thou wilt not accept a sacrifice; Though I should give a
   burnt-offering, it would not please thee.

   17 The sacrifices of God are an afflicted spirit: A heart afflicted and
   contrite, O God! thou wilt not despise.

   18 Do good in thy good pleasure to Zion; Build thou the walls of
   Jerusalem.

   19 Then shalt thou accept the sacrifices of righteousness, The
   burnt-offering and oblation; [328] Then shall come upon thy altar
   calves.

   PSALM 52

   To the Chief Musician. A lesson of instruction of David: when Doeg the
   Edomite came and told Saul, and said to him, that David had come into
   the house of Abimelech

   1 Why dost thou glory in thy wickedness, O mighty man? The goodness of
   God continueth daily.

   2 Thy tongue reckoneth up mischiefs, Like a razor [that is] sharp
   working deceitfully.

   3 Thou lovest wickedness more than goodness; Falsehood more than to
   speak righteousness. Selah.

   4 Thou lovest all words of deceit, O thou tongue of guilefulness!

   5 Likewise God shall destroy thee for ever: He shall lay hold on thee
   and pluck thee out of thy tabernacle, And root thee out of the land of
   the living. Selah.

   6 See it also shall the righteous ones, and shall fear, And at him they
   shall laugh.

   7 Behold! the man who made not God his strength; And trusted in the
   abundance of his riches, And was strong in his wickedness.

   8 But as for me I shall be like an olive-tree [that is] green in the
   house of God: I have trusted in the goodness of God for ever and ever.

   9 I will celebrate thee for ever, because thou hast done [it:] [329] I
   will wait on thy name, For it is good in the presence of thy meek ones.

   PSALM 53

   To the Chief Musician, upon Mahalath. A lesson of instruction ofDavid

   1 The fool hath said in his heart, "There is not a God:" They have
   corrupted [all good order,] they have done abominable work: There is
   none who doeth good.

   2 God from heaven looked down upon the sons of men, To see if there was
   any who did understand, Who did seek after God.

   3 Every one of them hath gone back; They have all together become
   corrupt: There is none that doeth good, not even one.

   4 Have they no knowledge, all these workers of iniquity? Eating my
   people [as] they eat bread: Upon Jehovah they have not called.

   5 There were they afraid with fear, where there was not fear; For
   scattered hath Jehovah the bones of him that encampeth against thee:
   Thou hast put them to shame because God hath despised them.

   6 Who shall give out of Zion deliverance to Israel? When bring back
   shall God the captivity of his people, Rejoice shall Jacob, exult shall
   Israel.

   PSALM 54

   To the Chief Musician, on Neginoth. A lesson of instruction of David.
   When the Ziphims came and said to Saul, "Doth not David hide himself
   with us?"

   1 O God! by thy name save me, And by thy strength judge me.

   2 O God! hear my prayer, Give ear to the words of my mouth.

   3 For strangers have risen up against me, And terrible ones have sought
   after my soul: They have not set God before them. Selah.

   4 Behold! God is a helper to me; The Lord is with those who uphold my
   soul.

   5 He shall repay evil to my adversaries: In thy truth cut them off.

   6 Willingly will I sacrifice to thee; I will celebrate thy name, O
   Jehovah! for it is good.

   7 For out of all trouble he hath delivered me; And [punishment] upon my
   adversaries mine eye hath seen.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 55

   To the Chief Musician on Neginoth. A lesson of instruction of David

   1 Give ear, O God! to my prayer, And hide not thyself from my
   supplication.

   2 Attend to me, and answer me: I will wail in my address, and will
   become tumultuous.

   3 By reason of the voice of the enemy -- Under the oppression of the
   ungodly; For they cast upon me iniquity, In wrath they set themselves
   against me.

   4 My heart trembleth within me, And the terrors of death have fallen
   upon me.

   5 Fear and trembling are come upon me, And horror hath overwhelmed me.

   6 And I said, "Who will give me wings like a dove? "I will fly away and
   be at rest.

   7 "Lo! I will flee far away, "I will repose in the desert. Selah.

   8 "I will hasten my escape from the tempestuous whirlwind."

   9 Destroy, O Lord! divide their tongue: For I have seen oppression and
   strife in the city.

   10 By day and night they go round it upon the walls thereof: And labor
   and sorrow are in the midst of it.

   11 Wickedness [330] is in the midst of it; And fraud and deceit depart
   not from the streets thereof.

   12 Truly it was not an enemy who reproached me, For [then] I could have
   borne [it:] It was not an adversary who magnified himself against me,
   For [then] I would have hid himself from him.

   13 But thou, a man according to my own rank, My guide, and my familiar
   friend.

   14 We sweetly exchanged our secret thoughts; Into the house of God we
   walked in company.

   15 Let death seize upon them, Let them descend into the grave alive;
   For wickedness [331] is I, their dwelling, in the midst of them.

   16 As for me, to God; will I cry, And Jehovah shall save me.

   17 In the evening, and the morning, and at noonday Will I pray, and cry
   aloud; And he shall hear my voice.

   18 He hath redeemed into peace my soul From the battle which was
   against me: For many were with me.

   19 Hear shall God, and shall afflict them, Even he who sitteth from
   ancient time. Selah. Because they have no changes, And fear not God.

   20 He hath set his hands against those who were at peace with him: He
   hath broken his covenant.

   21 Smoother than butter are the words of his mouth, And in his heart is
   war; Softer are his words than oil, And [yet] they are darts.

   22 Cast upon Jehovah whatever blessings thou askest from him, [332] And
   he shall feed thee; He shall not suffer for ever the righteous man to
   stagger.

   23 Thou, O God! shalt cast them into the pit of corruption: The men of
   blood and deceit shall not live out half their days: But as for me, I
   will hope in thee.

   PSALM 56

   To the Chief Musician upon, the silent dove in distant places. Michtam
   of David, when the Philistines took him in Gath

   1 Have mercy upon me, O God, For swallow me up doth man; He daily
   assaulting doth oppress me.

   2 Swallow me up do my enemies daily: Truly many strive to oppress me, O
   Jehovah, Most High!

   3 In the day when I was afraid, I in thee did trust.

   4 In God I will praise his word; In God have I trusted; I will not fear
   what flesh can do to me.

   5 Every day my words disquiet me; Against me are all their thoughts for
   evil.

   6 They assemble together, they hide themselves, My heels they watch,
   Because they desire my soul.

   7 In their iniquity they think there is escape for them: In thy wrath
   the peoples thou wilt cast down, O God!

   8 My wanderings thou numbereth, even thou: Put my tears into thy
   bottle; Are they not in thy register?

   9 Then my enemies shall be turned back in the day when I cry: This I
   know, because God is with me.

   10 In God will I praise [his] word; In Jehovah will I praise [his]
   word.

   11 In God have I trusted; I will not fear what man can do to me.

   12 Upon me, O God! are thy vows, I will render praises to thee.

   13 For thou hast delivered my soul from death: Hast thou not also
   delivered my feet from falling? That I may walk before God in the light
   of the living.

   PSALM 57

   To the Chief Musician. Destroy not. Michtam of David. When he fled from
   the face of Saul in the cave

   1 Have mercy upon me, O God! have mercy upon me; For in thee my soul
   doth trust; And in the shadow of thy wings will I hope, Until iniquity
   pass away.

   2 I will cry to God Most High, Who perfecteth [his work] towards me.

   3 He shall send from Heaven, And shall save me from the reproach of him
   who swalloweth me up: Send forth shall God his mercy and his truth.

   4 My soul is in the midst of lions; I lie among those who are set on
   fire, -- Among the sons of men, whose teeth are spears and arrows, And
   their tongue a sword [that is] sharp.

   5 Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God! Above all the earth thy
   glory.

   6 A net they have prepared for my steps: Bowed down is my soul: They
   have digged before me a pit, But they have fallen into it. Selah

   7 Prepared is my heart, O God! prepared is my heart: I will sing, and
   chant psalms.

   8 Awake my tongue, awake nablum [333] and harp: I will awake at dawn of
   day.

   9 I will celebrate thee, among the peoples, O Lord! I will sing psalms
   to thee among the nation:

   10 For great unto the heavens is thy goodness, And unto the clouds thy
   truth.

   11 Be thou exalted, above the heavens, O God! Above all the earth thy
   glory.

   To the Chief Musician. Destroy not. Michtam of David

   1 Do ye indeed, O ye congregation! speak righteousness? Uprightly do ye
   judge? O ye sons of men!

   2 Yea rather in your heart wickedness ye plot, On the earth violence
   your hands weigh out.

   3 Estranged are the ungodly from the womb, They have gone astray from
   their birth speaking falsehood.

   4 They have poison like the poison of a serpent, [They are] like the
   deaf adder which stoppeth her ear;

   5 Which listeneth not to the voice of the enchanter, -- Of him who
   exerciseth enchantment skillfully.

   6 O God! break their teeth in their mouth: The jawbones of the lions
   break, O Jehovah!

   7 Let them melt away like water, let them be gone: Let them bend their
   bow, and let their arrows be as if broken.

   8 Like a snail which melteth away let them vanish; Like the untimely
   birth of a woman which doth not see the sun.

   9 Before your pots can feel the fire of the bramble, Like flesh yet raw
   as a whirlwind he shall carry him away.

   10 Rejoice shall the righteous when he seeth the vengeance; His hands
   he shall wash in the blood of the ungodly.

   11 And men [334] shall say, "Truly there is fruit for the righteous,
   "Truly there is a God who judgeth in the earth."

   To the Chief Musician. Destroy not. Michtam of David. When Saul sent,
   and they watched the house to kill him

   1 Deliver me from my enemies, O my God! from those who rise up against
   me set me on high.

   2 Deliver me from the workers of iniquity, And from men of bloods save
   me:

   3 For lo! they have laid snares for my soul; Gathered together against
   me have the strong men; Not [for] my sin, nor [for] my wickedness, O
   Jehovah!

   4 Without any iniquity of mine they have run and prepared themselves.
   Awake and come to meet me, and behold.

   5 And thou, O Jehovah, God of armies! the God of Israel! Awake to visit
   all the nations; Do not have compassion upon any who transgress
   wickedly. Selah.

   6 They will return at evening; They will make a noise like a dog, And
   go round about the city.

   7 Behold they will prate with their mouth; Swords are in their lips;
   "For who," say they, "will hear?"

   8 But thou, O Jehovah! shalt laugh at them; Thou shalt hold in derision
   all the nations.

   9 His strength with thee I will put in trust; For God is my fortress.

   10 The God of my mercy shall prevent me; God will make me see my desire
   upon my enemies.

   11 Slay them not, lest my people should forget; Make them to wander by
   thy power; And bring them down, O Lord, our shield!

   12 The sin of their mouth, the words of their lips: Let them be taken
   in their pride: of cursing and lying let them speak.

   13 Consume, in thy fury consume them, that they may be no more; And let
   men know that God ruleth in Jacob, Even to the ends of the earth.
   Selah. [335]

   14 And they will return at evening; They will bark like a dog, And go
   round about the city.

   15 They will wander up and down for food; If they be not satisfied they
   will even stay all night.

   16 But as for me, I will sing of thy strength, I will praise in the
   morning thy mercy; For thou hast been a fortress to me, And a refuge in
   the day of my trouble.

   17 My strength is with thee, I will sing psalms; For God is my
   fortress, the God of my mercy.

   To the Chief Musician upon Shushan Eduth. Michtam of David to teach.
   When he fought against the Syrians of Mesopotamia and against the
   Syrians of Zobah; and when Joab, having returned, smote of the Edomites
   in the Valley of Salt twelve thousand

   1 O God! thou hast cast us off, thou hast scattered us; Thou hast been
   angry, O return to us!

   2 To tremble thou hast made the earth; Thou hast caused it to open
   wide; Heal the breaches thereof for it shaketh.

   3 Thou hast showed to thy people a hard thing, Thou hast made us drunk
   with the wine of stupefaction.

   4 Thou hast given to those who fear thee a banner, That it may be
   displayed before thy truth. Selah.

   5 That thy beloved ones may be delivered, Save with thy right hand and
   hear me.

   6 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice: I will divide
   Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I will measure.

   7 Mine shall be Gilead, and mine shall be Manasseh; And Ephraim shall
   be the strength of my head; Judah, my lawgiver.

   8 Moab shall be the pot for my washing; Over Edom will I cast my shoe;
   O Palestina! triumph thou over me.

   9 Who will bring me into the city fortified? Who will lead me into
   Edom?

   10 Wilt not thou, O God! who hadst cast us off? [thou] O God! [who]
   didst not go forth with our armies?

   11 Grant us relief from trouble, For vain is the help of man.

   12 Through God we shall do valiantly: And he it is who shall tread down
   our adversaries.

   To the rock which is higher than I thou shalt lead me.

   3 For thou hast been a hope to me, A tower of strength from the face of
   the enemy.

   4 I will dwell in thy tabernacle for ever; I will be safe under the
   covert of thy wings. Selah.

   5 For thou, O God! hast heard my vows: Thou hast given an inheritance
   to those who fear thy name.

   6 Days upon days to the king thou shalt add, His years shall be as many
   generations.

   7 He shall dwell for ever in the presence of God: Mercy and truth do
   thou prepare: thou shalt preserve him.

   8 So will I sing unto thy name for ever, That I may perform my vows
   every day.

   PSALM 62

   To the Chief Musician upon Jeduthun. A Psalm of David

   1 Nevertheless towards God silent is my soul: From him is my salvation.

   2 Nevertheless he is my reek and my salvation, My fortress: therefore I
   shall not be moved greatly.

   3 How long will ye continue to lay snares against a man? Ye shall be
   slain all of you: As an inclining wall shall ye be, and a fence that is
   shaken.

   4 Yet from his elevation they consult to east him down: They delight in
   falsehood: With their mouth they bless, And in their hearts they curse.
   Selah.

   5 Nevertheless towards God be thou silent O my soul: For from him is my
   expectation.

   6 Nevertheless he only is my rock, and my salvation: My fortress; I
   shall not fall.

   7 In God is my salvation and my glory; The rock of my strength; my hope
   is in God.

   8 Hope in him at all times, O ye people! Pour out before his face your
   hearts: God is our hope. Selah.

   9 Nevertheless vanity are the sons of Adam; A lie the sons of men: When
   put all together in a balance they are found lighter than vanity
   itself. [336]

   10 Trust not in oppression and robbery; be not vain: [Upon] riches if
   they abound set not your heart.

   11 Once God hath spoken; Twice this I have heard, "That power belongeth
   to God;" And to thee, O Lord! belongeth mercy; Truly thou wilt render
   to every man according to his work.

   1 O God! my God art thou; Early will I seek thee: Thirsted for thee
   hath my soul, Longed for thee hath my flesh, In this land [that is]
   inhospitable and dry, without water.

   2 Thus in the sanctuary have I beheld thee, To see thy power and thy
   glory.

   3 Because better is thy mercy than life, My lips shall praise thee.

   4 Thus will I bless thee in my life; In thy name I will lift up my
   hands.

   5 As with marrow and farness satisfied shall be my soul, And with lips
   of rejoicing shall my mouth praise thee

   6 Surely I will remember thee upon my bed; In the watches of the night
   I will meditate upon thee;

   7 Because thou hast been a help to me: And in the shadow of thy wings I
   will shout for joy.

   8 Cleaved hath my soul to [literally after] thee; Sustain me shall thy
   right hand.

   9 And they whilst they seek to destroy my soul, Shall go into the
   lowest parts of the earth.

   10 They shall east him down to the edge of the sword: The portion of
   foxes they shall be.

   11 But the king shall rejoice in God, And glory shall every one who
   sweareth by him: For stopped shall be the mouth of those who speak
   falsehood.

   my life.

   2 Hide me from the counsel of malignant men -- From the assembly of
   tire workers of iniquity.

   3 For they have sharpened as a sword their tongue; They have directed
   for their arrow a bitter word.

   4 To shoot in secret at the innocent man: Suddenly they will shoot and
   not fear.

   5 They encourage themselves in an impious action; They talk together of
   secretly laying snares; They say, "Who shall see them?"

   6 They have searched out iniquities, They have accomplished a searching
   search: And the inward part of each of them and the heart [is] deep.

   7 But God shall shoot at them an arrow; Suddenly shall they be wounded.

   8 And they shall make their own tongue fall upon themselves, And flee
   away shall all who see them.

   9 And see shall all men, and shall declare the work of God, And his
   doing they shall understand.

   10 Rejoice shall the righteous in Jehovah, and they shall hope in him;
   And glory shall all the upright in heart.

   He shall dwell in thy courts: We shall be satisfied with the goodness
   of thy house -- Of the sanctuary of thy palace.

   5 Terrible things in righteousness wilt thou answer us, O God of our
   salvation! The hope of all the ends of the earth, And of the far off
   places of the sea.

   6 Establishing the mountains by his power, [338] Being girded with
   might.

   7 Stilling the noise of the seas, And the noise of their waves, the
   tumults of the nations.

   8 And afraid shall be the dwellers in the ends of the earth at thy
   signs; The outgoings of the morning and evening thou shalt make to
   shout for joy.

   9 Thou hast visited the earth, and watered her; Thou hast abundantly
   enriched her: The river of God is full of waters: Thou wilt prepare
   their corn, For so thou hast prepared her.

   10 Her furrows thou dost saturate, Thou makest the rain to fall into
   her ridges, With showers thou dost moisten her, Her buddings thou dost
   bless.

   11 Thou crownest the year with thy beneficence, And thy paths will drop
   fatness.

   12 They drop upon the dwellings of the wilderness; And with gladness
   the hills shall be girded.

   13 Clothed are the pastures with flocks; And the valleys are covered
   with corn; They shout for joy, they also sing.

   PSALM 66

   To the Chief Justice,. A Song of a Psalm

   1 Shout joyfully to God all the earth,

   2 Sing the glory of his name, Make glorious his praise.

   3 Say unto God: "How terrible art thou in thy works! "Through the
   greatness of thy power shall thy enemies feign submission unto thee.

   4 "All the earth shall worship thee, and shall sing to thee, "They
   shall hymn thy name." Selah.

   5 Come ye, and see the works of God: He is terrible in his doing
   towards the sons of men.

   6 He turned the sea into dry land; Through the river [339] they passed
   on foot; There we were glad in him.

   7 He ruleth by his might over the world; [340] His eyes upon the
   nations are fixed: The rebels shall not exalt themselves. Selah.

   8 Bless, O ye people! our God, And resound the voice of his praise.

   9 Who hath brought our souls into life, And hath not suffered our feet
   to fall.

   10 For thou hast proved us, O God! Thou hast tried us as silver is
   tried:

   11 Thou hast brought us into the net Thou hast laid restraint upon our
   loins;

   12 Thou hast made man to ride over our heads; We have come into fire
   and water; And thou hast brought us into a place of abundance.

   13 I will come into thy house with burnt-offerings; I will pay thee my
   vows,

   14 Which my lips have uttered, And my mouth hath spoken in my
   affliction.

   15 Burnt-offerings of fat lambs I will offer to thee with incense of
   rams; I will bring bullocks with goats. Selah.

   16 Come, hear, and I will tell all you who fear God, What he hath done
   for my soul.

   17 To him with my mouth I cried, And I have exalted him with my tongue.

   18 If I have regarded iniquity in my heart, The Lord will not hear me.

   19 But truly heard me hath God; He hath attended to the voice of my
   prayer.

   20 Blessed be God who hath not turned away my prayer, Nor his mercy
   from me.

   To the Chief Musician on Neginoth. A Psalm [or] Song

   1 May God have compassion upon us, and bless us; May he cause his
   countenance to shine upon us. Selah.

   2 That thy way may be known upon the earth, Among all nations thy
   salvation.

   3 Let the peoples praise thee, O God! Let all the peoples celebrate
   thee.

   4 Let the peoples rejoice and exult, For he shall judge the peoples
   with rectitude, And the nations upon earth thou shalt guide. Selah.

   5 Let the peoples celebrate thee, O God! Let all the peoples celebrate
   thee:

   6 The earth hath given her increase; God [even] our own God will bless
   us.

   7 God will bless us; And fear him shall all the ends of the earth.

   PSALM 68

   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm [or] Song of David

   1 Arise shall God: scattered shall be his enemies; And flee from before
   his face shall those who hate him.

   2 As smoke is driven away thou shalt drive them away; As wax melteth
   before the fire, perish shall the ungodly from before the face of God.

   3 But the righteous shall rejoice, They shell exult before God, And
   leap for joy.

   4 Sing ye unto God, sing psalms to his name; Exalt him who rideth upon
   the clouds whose name is Jah, And exult before him.

   5 The father of the orphans, and the judge of the widows, Is God in the
   habitation of his holiness.

   6 God who causeth the solitary to dwell in a family, Who bringeth forth
   those who are bound with chains: But rebels shall dwell in a dry land.

   7 O God! when thou well test forth before thy people, When thou
   marchedst through the wilderness; Selah:

   8 The earth was moved, Also the heavens dropped at the presence of this
   God: Sinai at the presence of God, the God of Israel.

   9 A liberal rain thou shalt make to fall, O God! upon thy inheritance,
   And when it is weary thou refreshest it.

   10 Thy congregation shall dwell therein: Thou wilt provide in thy
   goodness for the poor, O God!

   11 The Lord shall give the word To the women who announce the great
   army.

   12 Kings of armies shall flee -- shall flee; And she who dwelleth
   within the house shall divide the spoils.

   13 Though ye should lie among the pots, in the ashes, Yet shall ye be
   as the wings of the dove covered with silver, And which behind is as
   fine yellow gold.

   14 When the Almighty scattered kings in it, It was white in Salmon.

   15 The mountain of God, the mountain of Bashan, The mountain of
   heights, the mountain of Bashan.

   16 Why leap ye, ye mountains of heights? The mountain in which it hath
   pleased God to dwell: Yea dwell in it will Jehovah for ever.

   17 The chariots of God [are] twenty thousand thousands of angels: The
   Lord is among them, In the sanctuary as in Sinai.

   18 Thou hast ascended on high; Thou hast led captive captivity; Thou
   hast received gifts among men; Yea even [among] rebels, That Jehovah
   God might dwell in the midst of his people

   19 Blessed be God day by day: This God will load us with deliverances.
   Selah.

   20 Our God is the God of salvations; And to Jehovah Lord belong the
   issues of death.

   21 Surely God shall wound the head of his enemies, The crown of the
   hair of him who walketh in his wickedness.

   22 The Lord hath said: "From Bashan I will bring back; "I will bring
   back from the depths of the sea:

   23 "That thy foot may be stained with blood, "The tongue of thy dogs
   even in that of thy enemies."

   24 They have seen thy goings, O God!-- The goings of my God, my King,
   in the sanctuary.

   25 Before went the singers; [Then] followed the players on instruments;
   In the midst [were] the damsels striking the timbrels.

   26 In the congregations bless ye God, [Even] the Lord, ye who are of
   the fountain of Israel!

   27 There was little Benjamin their ruler, The princes of Judah in their
   assembly, The princes of Zebulun, the princes of Naphthali.

   28 Commanded hath thy God thy strength; Strengthen, O God! what thou
   hast wrought in us.

   29 From thy temple upon Jerusalem To thee shall kings bring presents.

   30 Destroy the company of spearmen, The assembly of bulls, with the
   calves of the peoples, Treading with their feet upon pieces of silver:
   Scatter thou the peoples that in wars delight.

   31 Princes shall come out of Egypt; Ethiopia shall speedily stretch
   forth her hands to God.

   32 O ye kingdoms of the earth! sing unto God: Sing psalms to the Lord.
   Selah.

   33 To him who rideth upon the heavens of heavens which are of old: Lo!
   he shall send forth in his voice a voice of strength,

   34 Ascribe ye strength to God over Israel; His majesty and his strength
   [are] in the clouds.

   35 Terrible art thou, O God! out of thy holy places: The God of Israel
   himself shall give strength and might to his people. Blessed be God!

   PSALM 69

   To the Chief Musician upon Shoshannim. Of David

   1 Save me, O God! For entered have the waters even to my soul.

   2 I am sunk into deep mire where there is no standing place; I am come
   into the depths of waters, And the floods of water have overflowed me.

   3 I am weary with crying, Hoarse is my throat become therewith; Failed
   have my eyes with waiting for my God.

   4 More in number than the hairs of my head are those who hate me
   without cause: Increased are those who desire to destroy me, [even] my
   lying adversaries: That which I took not by violence, then I restored
   it.

   5 O God! thou knowest my foolishness, And my faults from thee are not
   hidden.

   6 Let not those be ashamed in me that wait for thee, O Lord, Jehovah of
   armies! Let not those be put to shame in me who seek thee, O God of
   Israel!

   7 For on thy account I have suffered reproach; Shame hath covered my
   face.

   8 A stranger I have been to my brethren, And an alien I am become to
   the children of my mother.

   9 For the zeal of thy house hath eaten me up; And the reproaches of
   those who reproached thee have fallen upon me.

   10 And I wept, my soul fasted; And that was for a reproach to me.

   11 And I made my garment sackcloth; And I was to them for a jest.

   12 Defame me do those who sit in the gate; And I am the songs of those
   who drink intoxicating liquor.

   13 But as for me my prayer [is] to thee, O Jehovah! In the time of thy
   favor, O God! In the multitude of thy mercy answer me, In the truth of
   thy salvation.

   14 Rescue me from the mire that I may not sink; That I may be delivered
   from my adversaries, And from the depths of waters.

   15 Let not the flood of waters overflow me; And let not the deep
   swallow me up; And let not the pit dose its mouth upon me.

   16 Answer me, O Jehovah! for good is thy mercy: In the multitude of thy
   compassions look upon me.

   17 And hide not thy face from thy servant, for I am afflicted: Hasten!
   answer me!

   18 Draw near to my soul, redeem it: On account of my adversaries
   deliver me.

   19 Thou knowest my reproach, and my confusion, and my ignominy: Before
   thee are all my adversaries.

   20 Reproach hath broken my heart, and I am afflicted; And I looked for
   some one to show compassion, but there was none; For comforters, but I
   found them not.

   21 And they put into my meat gall, And in my thirst they gave me
   vinegar to drink.

   22 Let their table be before them for a snare; And their prosperity for
   a net;

   23 Darkened let be their eyes, that they may not see; And cause their
   loins continually to tremble.

   24 Pour out upon them thy wrath; And let the fury of thy indignation
   take hold of them.

   25 Let their palace be desolate; In their tents let there not be a
   dweller.

   26 For him whom thou hast smitten they have persecuted; And to the
   grief of those whom thou hast wounded they have added.

   27 Add iniquity to their iniquity; And let them not enter into thy
   righteousness.

   28 Let them be blotted out of the book of the living; And with the
   righteous let them not be written.

   29 But as for me I am poor and sorrowful: Thy salvation shall exalt me.

   30 I will praise the name of God in a song, And I will magnify him with
   thanksgiving.

   31 And this will please Jehovah More than a young bullock that hath
   horns and hoofs.

   32 Seen it have the afflicted, And they shall rejoice at it who seek
   God; And live shall your heart.

   33 For hearkened hath Jehovah to the afflicted; And his prisoners he
   hath not despised.

   34 Praise him let heaven and earth; The seas and whatever creepeth in
   them.

   35 For God will save Zion, And will build the cities of Judah; And they
   shall dwell there, And possess it by inheritance.

   36 And the seed of his servants shall inherit it; And they who love his
   name shall dwell in it.

   PSALM 70

   To the Chief Musician. Of David. To call to remembrance

   1 O God! to deliver me, O Jehovah! to my aid, hasten.

   2 Let those be ashamed and confounded who seek after my soul; Let those
   be turned backward and put to confusion who desire my hurt.

   3 Let those be destroyed for a reward of their shame, Who say to me,
   "Aha! Aha!"

   4 Exult and rejoice in thee let all who seek thee; And let those say,
   "For ever may God be magnified" -- Those who love thy salvation.

   5 But as for me I am poor and needy: O God! hasten to me: My help and
   my deliverer art thou: O Jehovah! delay not.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 71

   1 In thee, O Jehovah! do I put my trust, Let me not be put to shame for
   ever.

   2 In thy righteousness deliver me, and rescue me; Incline to me thy
   ear, and save me.

   3 Be thou to me for a rock of strength, Into which I may enter at all
   times: Thou hast given commandment to save me; For my tower and my
   fortress art thou.

   4 O my God! deliver me from the hand of the ungodly man, -- From the
   hand of the wicked and violent men.

   5 For thou art my expectation, O Lord Jehovah! My trust from my youth.

   6 Upon thee have I been sustained from the womb; Out of my mother's
   bowels thou art he who took me: Of thee is my praise continually.

   7 As a prodigy I have been to the great ones, And yet thou art my
   strong confidence.

   8 Filled shall be my mouth with thy praise, Daily with thy glory.

   9 Cast me not off in the time of my old age: In the declining of my
   strength forsake me not.

   10 For my enemies have spoken concerning me, And those who watch for my
   soul have consulted together,

   11 Saying, "God hath forsaken him; "Follow after him, and ye shall take
   him; "For there is none to deliver him."

   12 O God! be not far from me: O my God! to my aid hasten.

   13 Let those be put to shame, let those fail who are the adversaries of
   my soul: Let those be covered with reproach mid shame who seek my hurt.

   14 But as for me continually will I hope, And will add to all thy
   praise.

   15 My mouth shall tell of thy righteousness, Daily of thy salvation;
   For I know not the number thereof

   16 I will go in the strength of the Lord Jehovah! I will remember thy
   righteousness alone.

   17 O God! thou hast taught me from my youth; And unto this time will I
   announce thy wonders.

   18 And therefore [341] in old age and gray hairs, O God! forsake me
   not, Until I have declared thy strength to the generation, To all who
   are to come thy might.

   19 And thy righteousness, O God! is very high: For thou hast done great
   things: O God! who is like to thee?

   20 Thou hast made me to see troubles many and grievous, But being
   turned thou wilt quicken me, And from the depths of the earth, being
   turned thou wilt raise me up.

   21 Thou wilt multiply my greatness; And being turned thou wilt comfort
   me.

   22 Moreover, I, even I, will sing to thee on instruments of music;
   [342] For thy truth, O my God! I will sing psalms to thee upon the
   harp, O Holy One of Israel!

   23 Exult shall my lips, when I sing psalms to thee; And my soul which
   thou hast redeemed.

   24 Also my tongue daily shall declare thy righteousness; For they are
   put to shame, for they are disgraced, who seek my hurt.

   PSALM 72

   Of Solomon

   1 O God! thy judgments give to the King, And thy righteousness to the
   son of the King

   2 He shall judge thy people in righteousness, And thy poor ones in
   judgment.

   3 Bring forth shall the mountains peace to the people, And the hills in
   righteousness.

   4 He shall judge the poor ones of the people; He shall save the
   children of the afflicted; And shall break in pieces the calumniator.

   5 They shall fear thee with the sun; And before the moon the generation
   of generations shall fear thee.

   6 He shall descend as rain upon the mown grass; As the showers which
   water the earth.

   7 Flourish in his days shall the righteous; And abundance of peace
   until there be no more moon.

   8 And he shall have dominion from sea to sea, And from the river even
   to the ends of the earth.

   9 Before him shall bow the inhabitants of the desert, And his enemies
   shall lick the dust.

   10 The kings of Tarshish and of the isles a present shall bring: The
   kings of Sheba and Seba a gift shall offer to him

   11 And all kings shall prostrate themselves before him; All nations
   shall serve him.

   12 For he shall deliver the poor who crieth to him, And the needy who
   hath no helper.

   13 He will have compassion upon the indigent and the poor one, And the
   souls of the poor ones he will save.

   14 From fraud and violence he will redeem their souls, And precious
   shall be their blood in his eyes.

   15 And he shall live, and there shall be given to him of the gold of
   Sheba, And prayer shall be made for him continually; Daily shall he be
   blessed.

   16 There shall be sown an handful of corn in the earth on the top of
   the mountains; The fruit thereof shall be shaken like [that] of
   Lebanon. And they shall go forth from the city as a plant of the earth.

   17 His name shall be for ever; In presence of the sun propagated shall
   be his name: And bless themselves in him shall all nations, And blessed
   they shall call him.

   18 Blessed be Jehovah God! the God of Israel! [343] Who doeth wonderful
   things alone.

   19 And blessed be his glorious name for ever; And let all the earth be
   filled with his glory. Amen and Amen.

   20 Finished are the prayers of David, the son of Jesse.

   PART THIRD [344]

   PSALM 73

   A Psalm of Asaph

   1 Yet God is good to Israel, To those who are right in heart.

   2 As for me, wellnigh slipped had my feet, My steps were almost gone:

   3 For I was envious at the foolish, On seeing the prosperity of the
   ungodly.

   4 For there are no bands to their death, And vigorous is their
   strength.

   5 In the [common] trouble of man they are not; And with other men they
   are not scourged.

   6 Therefore encompass them as a chain doth pride; Covered them hath the
   raiment of violence.

   7 Their eye projecteth through fatness; They have passed beyond the
   thoughts of their heart.

   8 They break forth, and talk wickedly of extortion: From on high do
   they speak.

   9 They have set against the heaven their mouth, And their tongue
   walketh through the earth.

   10 On this account his people will return hither, And waters of a full
   cup will be wrung out to them.

   11 And they say, "How doth God know? " "And is there knowledge in the
   Most High?"

   12 Behold these are the ungodly, and [yet] they are in quiet for ever:
   They heap up riches.

   13 Surely in vain I have purified my heart, And washed every day my
   hands:

   14 And I have been scourged every day, And my chastisement [has been]
   every morning.

   15 If I have said, "I will speak thus," Behold! the generation of thy
   children: I have transgressed.

   16 And although I applied my mind to know this, A pain fill thing it
   was in mine eyes,

   17 Until I entered into the sanctuaries of God, And understood their
   end.

   18 Surely in slippery places thou hast set them; Thou shalt east them
   down into destructions.

   19 How have they been destroyed as in a moment! They have perished,
   they have been consumed with terrors.

   20 As it were a dream after a man is awakened; O Lord! in awaking,
   their image thou wilt render contemptible.

   21 For in a ferment was my heart, And in my reins I was pierced.

   22 And I myself [was] foolish and knew not any thing; As the beasts
   have I been before thee.

   23 Nevertheless I have been continually with thee; Thou hast held my
   right hand.

   24 With thy counsel thou shalt guide me; And at length to glory thou
   shalt take me.

   25 Whom have I in heaven but thee? And another with time I have not
   desired on the earth.

   26 Failed have my flesh and my heart; But the strength of my heart and
   my portion is God for ever.

   27 For lo! those who depart from thee shall perish: Thou hast destroyed
   every one who goeth a whoring from thee.

   28 As for me, to draw near to God is good for me: I have put in the
   Lord Jehovah my trust, That I may tell of all thy works.

   PSALM 74

   An Instruction of Asaph

   1 Wherefore, O God! hast thou cast us off for ever? [Why] smoketh thy
   wrath against the flock of thy pastures?

   2 Remember thy congregation which thou hast possessed of old; [345]
   Which thou hast redeemed, the rod of thy inheritance, This Mount Zion
   in which thou hast dwelt.

   3 Lift up thy strokes to desolations perpetual, Against every enemy who
   doeth mischief to the sanctuary.

   4 Roared like lions have thy adversaries in the midst of thy
   sanctuaries; They have set up their signs for signs.

   5 He was renowned as doing an excellent work Who lifted up the axes
   upon the thick trees. [346]

   6 And now the carved works thereof together, With the hatchet and with
   hammers they break in pieces.

   7 They have set on fire thy sanctuaries; Leveling it with the ground,
   they have polluted the dwelling-place of thy name.

   8 They have said in their heart, "Let us destroy them altogether." They
   have burned all the tabernacles of God in the land.

   9 Our signs we see not; There is no longer a prophet, Nor is there with
   us one who knoweth how long! --

   10 How long, O God! shall the adversary reproach? Shall the enemy
   blaspheme thy name for ever?

   11 How long wilt thou withdraw thy hand, and thy right hand? In the
   midst, of thy bosom consume them.

   12 But God is my king from the beginning, Working salvations in the
   midst of the earth.

   13 Thou didst divide [347] by thy power the sea; Thou didst break the
   heads of dragons in the waters.

   14 Thou didst break the head of the leviathan; Thou gavest him for food
   to thy people in the wilderness.

   15 Thou didst cleave the fountain and the torrent: Thou didst dry up
   mighty rivers.

   16 Thine is the day; thine also is the night: Thou hast ordained the
   light and the sun.

   17 Thou hast fixed all the boundaries of the earth: The summer and the
   winter thou hast made.

   18 Remember this: the enemy hath reproached Jehovah; And a worthless
   people hath done despite to thy name.

   19 Give not to the beast the soul of thy turtle dove: The congregation
   of thy poor ones forget not for ever.

   20 Have regard to thy covenant; For filled are the dark places of the
   earth with the abodes of violence.

   21 Let not the afflicted one return ashamed; Let the poor and needy one
   praise thy name.

   22 Arise, O God! plead thy own cause: Remember thy reproach, which is
   done thee by the foolish man daily.

   23 Forget not the voice of thy adversaries: The tumult of those who
   rise up against thee ascendeth continually.

   PSALM 75

   To the Chief Musician. Destroy not. A Psalm of Asaph. A song

   1 We will celebrate thee, O God! we will celebrate thee; And near is
   thy name: they will declare thy wonders.

   2 When I shall have taken the congregation, I in uprightness will
   judge.

   3 Dissolved is the earth, and all the inhabitants thereof: will
   establish the pillars of it. Selah.

   4 I said to the fools, "Act not foolishly;" And to the ungodly, "Raise
   not up the horn."

   5 Raise not up on high your horn; And speak not with a stiff neck.

   6 For neither from the east, nor from the west, Nor from the wilderness
   are exaltations.

   7 For God is judge: tie bringeth low, and he setteth up.

   8 For a cup is in the hand of Jehovah, and the wine is turbid; It is
   full of mixture, and he shall pour forth of it. Surely the dregs
   thereof they shall wring out;. And drink of it shall all the wicked of
   the earth.

   9 But as for me I will publish for ever, I will sing psalms to the God
   of Jacob.

   10 And all the horns of the ungodly I will break; But exalted shall be
   the horns of the righteous.

   3 There he broke the arrows of the bow, The shield, and the sword, and
   the battle. Selah.

   4 More glorious, more terrible art thou Than the mountains of prey.

   5 Spoiled were the stout in heart, They slept their sleep: And none of
   the men of might have found their hands.

   6 At thy rebuke, O God of Jacob! Cast into a deep sleep were the
   chariot and the horse.

   7 Thou art terrible [even] thou; And who shall stand before thy face
   when thou art angry?

   8 From the heavens thou hast made judgment to be heard: The earth was
   afraid and was still,

   9 When God arose to judgment, To save all the meek of the earth. Selah.

   10 Surely the wrath of men shall praise thee, The remainder of wrath
   thou wilt restrain.

   11 Vow and pay to Jehovah your God: Let all who are round about him
   bring a present to the terrible one.

   12 He will cut off the spirit of princes: He is terrible to the kings
   of the earth.

   PSALM 77

   To the Chief Musician upon Jeduthun. A Psalm of Asaph

   1 My voice [I lifted up] to God, and I cried; My voice [I lifted up] to
   God, and he heard me.

   2 In the day of my affliction the Lord I sought: My hand in the night
   was stretched out and relaxed not; Refuse consolation did my soul.

   3 I will remember God, and will be disquieted; I will meditate, and
   oppressed with sorrow shall be my spirit. Selah.

   4 Thou hast held the watches of my eyes: I am troubled, and will not
   speak.

   5 I have recounted the days of old, The years of ages past.

   6 I will call to remembrance my song in the night: With my heart I will
   meditate, And search diligently shall my spirit.

   7 For ever will the Lord east off? And will he be favorable no more?

   8 Gone for ever is his mercy? Fail doth his oracle from generation to
   generation?

   9 Forgotten to be merciful hath God? Hath he shut up in anger his
   compassions? Selah.

   10 And I said my disease [is only for a season;] The years of the right
   hand of the Most High [I will wait for.]

   11 I will remember the works of God; Surely I will remember thy wonders
   from the beginning.

   12 And I will meditate on all thy works, And on thy doings I will muse.

   13 O God! in the sanctuary are thy ways: What god is so great as God?

   14 Thou art the God who doest wonders; Thou hast made known among the
   peoples thy strength.

   15 Thou hast redeemed by [thy] arm thy people, The sons of Jacob and
   Joseph. Selah.

   16 See thee did the waters, O God! see thee did the waters; They were
   afraid; also tremble did the deeps.

   17 The clouds poured out waters; The heavens gave forth a voice: Also
   thine arrows went abroad.

   18 The voice of thy thunder was in the circuit, The lightnings
   illumined the world; The earth trembled and was shaken.

   19 In the sea are thy ways, And thy paths in the great waters; And thy
   footsteps are not known.

   20 Thou leadest like sheep thy people By the hand of Moses and Aaron.

   PSALM 78

   A lesson of Instruction [of] Asaph

   1 Give ear, O my people! to my law: Incline your ears to the words of
   my month.

   2 I will open in a parable my mouth; I will utter enigmas from ancient
   Sae.

   3 What we have heard and known, And our' fathers have related to us,

   4 We will not conceal from their children to the generation to come,
   Recounting the praises of Jehovah and his might, And the wonders which
   he hath done.

   5 And he established a testimony in, Jacob, And a law he appointed in
   Israel; For he commanded our fathers To make them known to their
   children;

   6 That the generations to come might know them, That the children to be
   born might arise, And declare them to their children.

   7 That they might set in God their hope, And not forget the works of
   God; But that his commandments they might observe,

   8 And not be as their fathers, A generation rebellious and provoking; A
   generation which set not their heart might, And whose spirit was not
   faithful towards God.

   9 The children of Ephraim, armed [and] shooting with the bow, Were
   turned back in the day of battle.

   10 They kept not the covenant of God, And in his law they refused to
   walk.

   11 And they forget his works, And the wonders which he had shown them.

   12 In the sight of their fathers he wrought marvelously; In the land of
   Egypt, in the field of Zoan.

   13 He divided the sea, and caused them to pass through, And made the
   waters to stand as an heap.

   14 And he led them by a cloud in the day; And all the night by the
   light of fire.

   15 He clave the rocks in the wilderness, And made them to drink in
   great deeps.

   16 And he brought forth streams from the rock, And made the waters to
   descend like rivers.

   17 Yet they continued still to sin against him, To provoke the Most
   High in the wilderness.

   18 And they tempted God in their heart, By asking food for their soul.

   19 And they spake against God: They said, "Can God prepare a table in
   the wilderness?"

   20 Behold! he smote the reek, and gush out did the waters; And rivers
   overflowed. "Can he give bread also? "Will he prepare flesh for his
   people?"

   21 Therefore Jehovah heard and was wroth: And a fire was kindled in
   Jacob: And wrath also ascended against Israel;

   22 Because they believed not in God, And trusted not in his salvation.

   23 But he had commanded the clouds from above, And the doors of heaven
   he had opened,

   24 And had rained down upon them manna for food, And the corn of heaven
   he had given them:

   25 The bread of the mighty ones man had eaten: Meat he had sent them to
   the full.

   26 He caused to blow an east wind in the heavens; And he raised up by
   his power the south wind.

   27 And he rained upon them flesh as dust, And as the sand of the sea
   leathered fowl;

   28 And he caused it to fall in the midst of his camp, Round about his
   tabernacles.

   29 And they did eat and were filled exceedingly, And their desire he
   brought to them.

   30 They were not estranged from their desire: The meat was still in
   their mouth,

   31 When the wrath of God ascended against them, And slew their fat
   ones, And brought low the chosen of Israel.

   32 In all these things they sinned still, And believed not his wonders.

   33 And he consumed in vanity their days, And their years in haste.

   34 When he slew them, they sought him; They returned, and hastened
   early to God.

   35 And they remembered that God was their Rock, And that the Most High
   God was their Redeemer.

   36 And they flattered [him] with their mouth, And with their tongue
   they lied to him:

   37 But their heart was not right before him, And they were not faithful
   in his covenant.

   38 Yet he who is compassionate expiated their iniquity, And did not
   destroy them: And he multiplied to turn away his anger, And did not
   stir up all his indignation.

   39 And he remembered that they were flesh; A breath that passeth, and
   returneth not.

   40 How often did they provoke him in the desert, [And] grieve him in
   the wilderness!

   41 And they returned and tempted God, And the Holy One of Israel they
   limited.

   42 They remembered not his hand In the day that he redeemed them from
   the oppressor,

   43 When he set in Egypt his signs, And his miracles in the field of
   Zoan.

   44 When he turned into blood their rivers; And their streams, that they
   might not drink of them.

   45 He sent among them a mixture which devoured them; And the frog which
   destroyed them.

   46 And he gave to the caterpillar their fruit; And their labors to the
   locusts. [348]

   47 And he destroyed with hail their vine, And their wild fig-trees with
   hailstones.

   48 And he gave lip to the hail their cattle, And their flocks to
   thunderbolts.

   49 He sent upon them the fierceness of his wrath, Fury, anger, and
   affliction, A mission of evil angels.

   50 He made a path for his anger: He kept not from death their soul, And
   their cattle to the pestilence he shut up.

   51 And he smote all the firstborn in Egypt: The beginning of [their]
   strength in the tents of Ham.

   52 And he made to go forth like sheep his people, And led them like a
   flock in the wilderness.

   53 And he conducted them in safety, and they were not afraid: And their
   enemies cover did the sea.

   54 And he brought them to the border of his holiness, This mountain,
   which his right hand acquired.

   55 And he expelled from before their face the heathen; And made them to
   fall into the lot of all inheritance; And caused to dwell in their
   tents the children of Israel.

   56 But they tempted and provoked God Most High, And his testimonies
   they kept not.

   57 And they turned back and dealt perfidiously like their fathers: They
   started aside like a bow that is deceitful.

   58 And they provoked him to anger with their high places; And with
   their graven images they moved him to anger.

   59 Hear it did God, and was wroth, And he abhorred exceedingly Israel.

   60 And he forsook the habitation of Shiloh, The tabernacle where he
   dwelt among men.

   61 And he gave into captivity his strength, And his beauty into the
   hand of the enemy.

   62 And he shut up to the sword his people, And with his own inheritance
   was wroth.

   63 Their chosen devour did the fire, And their virgins were not
   applauded.

   64 Their priests by the sword did fall; And their widows made no
   lamentation.

   65 But the Lord awoke as one asleep, As a mighty man who crieth out by
   reason of wine.

   66 And he smote his enemies behind; Everlasting disgrace he put upon
   them.

   67 And he rejected the tabernacle of Joseph, And the tribe of Ephraim
   he chose not:

   68 But he chose the tribe of Judah, The mountain of Zion, which he
   loved:

   69 And built like high places his sanctuary, Like the earth which he
   hath founded for ever.

   70 And he chose David his servant, And took him from the folds of
   sheep:

   71 From following the suckling ewes he took him, To feed Jacob his
   people, And Israel his inheritance:

   72 And he fed them in the integrity of his heart, And by the prudence
   of his hands he guided there.

   PSALM 79

   A Psalm of Asaph

   1 O God! come have the heathen into thy inheritance; They have polluted
   the temple of thy holiness; They have laid Jerusalem in heaps. [fowls
   of the heavens;

   2 They have given the dead bodies of thy servants for food to the fowls
   of the heavens; The flesh of thy meek ones to the beasts of the earth.

   3 They have shed their blood like water around Jerusalem: And there was
   not one to bury them

   4 We have been a reproach to our neighbors; A scorn and a derision to
   those who are around us.

   5 How long, O Jehovah! wilt thou be wroth for ever? Burn like fire
   shall thy jealousy?

   6 Pour out thy wrath upon the heathen who have not known thee, And upon
   the kingdoms which upon thy name do not call:

   7 For they have devoured Jacob, And his dwelling they have laid waste.

   8 Remember not against us former iniquities: Make haste, let thy
   compassions prevent us; For we are afflicted exceedingly.

   9 Help us, O God of our salvation! for the glory of thy name; And
   deliver us, and be merciful to our sins, for the sake of thy name.

   10 Wherefore should the heathen say, "Where is their God?" Let be made
   known among the heathen in our sight The vengeance of the blood of thy
   servants which is shed.

   11 Let the sighing of the prisoner come before thy face: According to
   the greatness of thy arm, Reserve the children of death: [349]

   12 And recompense our neighbors sevenfold into their bosom, Their
   reproach with which they have reproached thee, O Jehovah!

   13 And we thy people, and the sheep of thy pastures, Will confess to
   thee for ever; From generation to generation declaring thy praise.

   PSALM 80

   To the Chief Musician upon Shoshannim Eduth. A Psalm of Asaph

   1 O Shepherd of Israel, give ear! Who leadest Joseph like a flock; Thou
   who sittest between the cherubim, shine forth.

   2 Before Ephraim, and Benjamin, and Manasseh, Stir up thy strength, and
   come for our salvation.

   3 Turn us again, O God! and cause to shine thy face, And we shall be
   safe.

   4 O Jehovah God of armies! How long wilt thou be incensed against the
   prayer of thy people?

   5 Thou hast fed us with bread of tears; And hast given us tears to
   drink in great measure.

   6 Thou hast made us a strife to our neighbors: And our enemies laugh at
   us among themselves.

   7 O God of armies! turn us again, And cause to shine thy face upon us,
   And we shall be safe.

   8 A vine out of Egypt thou hast brought: Thou hast expelled the
   heathen, and planted it,.

   9 Thou hast cleansed the ground before it: Thou hast rooted its roots,
   And it hath filled the land.

   10 Covered were the mountains with its shadow, And its branches were
   like the cedars of God.

   11 It sent forth its branches to the sea, And to the river its shoots.

   12 Why then hast thou broken down its hedges, So that tear it in pieces
   do all who pass by the way?

   13 Wasted it hath the boar out of the forest; And the wild beast of the
   field hath eaten it up.

   14 O God of armies! return, I beseech thee, Look down from heaven, and
   behold, And visit this vine,

   15 And the vineyard which planted hath thy right hand, And [look] upon
   the shoot [350] which thou hast strengthened for thyself.

   16 It is burnt with fire; it is cut down; At the rebuke of thy
   countenance they perish.

   17 Let thy hand be upon the Man of thy right hand, Upon the son of man
   whom thou hast strengthened for thyself,

   18 And we will not go back from thee: Thou shalt quicken us, and upon
   thy name we will call.

   19 O Jehovah, God of armies! turn us again; Cause to shine thy face,
   And we shall be safe.

   PSALM 81

   To the Chief Musician upon Gittith. Of Asaph

   1 Exult to God our strength: Shout for joy to the God of Jacob.

   2 Take a song, and bring forth the timbrel, The harp of pleasantness
   with the nablum. [351]

   3 Sound the trumpet [352] at the new moon; At the time appointed on the
   day of our sacrifice.

   4 For a statute to Israel is this, A judgment to the God of Jacob.

   5 For a testimony in Joseph he set it, When he went forth over the land
   of Egypt! A language which I understood not I heard.

   6 "I removed from the burden his shoulder: "His hands from the pots
   were removed.

   7 "In trouble thou didst cry, and I rescued thee: "I answered thee in
   the secret place of thunder: "I proved thee at the waters of Meribah.
   Selah.

   8 "Hear, O my people! and I will protest to thee: "O Israel! if thou
   wilt hearken to me.

   9 "Let there not be in thee a strange god: "Neither worship thou a
   foreign god.

   10 "I am Jehovah thy God, "Who brought thee out of the land of Egypt:
   "Open wide thy mouth, and I will fill it.

   11 "But my people hearkened not to my voice, "And Israel would have
   none of me.

   12 "And I gave them up to the hardness of their heart: "They shall walk
   in their own counsels.

   13 "O if my people had hearkened to me! "If Israel in my ways had
   walked!

   14 "Soon their enemies I would have brought low, "And against their
   adversaries I would have turned my hand:

   15 "The haters of Jehovah would have lied to him, "And their time
   should have been for ever:

   16 "And I would have fed them with the fat of corn: "And from the rock
   with honey I would have satisfied thee."

   A Psalm of Asaph

   1 God sitteth in the assembly of God: In the midst of the gods he will
   judge.

   2 How long will ye judge unjustly? And the faces of the ungodly will ye
   lift up? Selah.

   3 Judge the poor and the orphan; The helpless and the destitute justify
   ye.

   4 Rescue the poor one and the afflicted one: From the hand of the
   ungodly ones deliver them

   5 But they know not, neither do they understand any thing: In darkness
   they walk, Although moved are all the foundations of the earth.

   6 As for me, I have said, "Ye are gods, "And children of the Most High
   all of you:

   7 "Surely as a man ye shall die; "And as one [of the people,] O

   A Song [or] Psalm, of Asaph

   1 O God! keep not silence with thyself; Hold not thy peace, and be not
   still, O God!

   2 For behold! thy enemies make a tumult: And those who hate thee have
   lifted up the head.

   3 Against thy people they have craftily formed a design, And have
   consulted against thy hidden ones.

   4 They have said, "Come and let us cut them off from being a nation;
   "And let there be no remembrance of the name of Israel any more."

   5 For they have consulted with the heart together; Against thee a
   covenant they have made.

   6 The tents of Edom, and of the Ishmaelites; Of Moab and of the
   Hagarenes.

   7 Gebal, and Ammon, and Amalek; The Philistines with the inhabitants of
   Tyre.

   8 Also Assur is associated with them: They have been an arm to the sons
   of Lot. Selah.

   9 Do to them as to the Midianites, As to Sisera, as to Jabin, at the
   brook Kishon.

   10 They perished at Endor; They became manure for the earth.

   11 Make them, [even] their princes, like Oreb, and like Zeeb; And like
   Zebah, and like Zalmunna, all their princes.

   12 Who have said, "Let us take in possession for ourselves "The
   habitations of God."

   13 O my God! make them like a whirling ball; Like stubble before the
   wind.

   14 As fire burneth a forest, And as the flame kindleth the mountains,

   15 So pursue them with thy tempest, And with thy whirlwind terrify
   them.

   16 Fill their faces with shame; That they may seek thy name, O Jehovah!

   17 Let them be ashamed, and terrified for ever; [353] And let them be
   confounded, and perish.

   18 And let them know that thou, even thou, art, thy name Jehovah, Thou
   alone the Most High over all the earth.

   To The Chief Musician Upon Gittith. A Psalm of the sons of Korah

   1 How amiable are thy tabernacles, O Jehovah of armies!

   2 Long, yea, even faint doth my soul after the courts of Jehovah: My
   heart and my flesh leap for joy towards the living God.

   3 Also the sparrow hath found a house for herself, And the swallow a
   nest for herself, Where she may place her young ones: O thine altars!
   thou Jehovah of armies! my King and my God!

   4 Blessed are those who dwell in thy house: Continually they will be
   praising thee. Selah.

   5 Blessed is the man whose strength is in thee; The ways [are] in their
   heart.

   6 They passing through the valley of weeping, will together make it a
   fountain; Also the cisterns the rain will cover.

   7 They will journey from strength to strength; Seen will be the God of
   gods in Zion.

   8 O Jehovah, God of armies! hear my prayer: Hearken, O God of Jacob!
   Selah.

   9 Our shield do thou behold, O God! And look upon the face of thy
   Christ.

   10 For better is one day in thy courts than a thousand elsewhere. I
   would rather be a doorkeeper in the house of my God, Than dwell in the
   tents of ungodliness.

   11 For a sun and shield is Jehovah God to us; Grace and glory give will
   Jehovah; He will not withhold any good from those who walk uprightly.

   12 O Jehovah of armies! Blessed is the man who confideth in thee.

   PSALM 85

   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of the sons of Korah

   1 Thou hast been favorable, O Jehovah! to thy land: Thou hast brought
   back the captivity of Jacob.

   2 Thou hast taken away the iniquity of thy people: Thou hast covered
   all their sins. Selah

   3 Thou hast turned away all thy anger: Thou hast drawn back the fury of
   thy indignation.

   4 Turn us, O God of our salvation! And relax thy anger against us.

   5 Wilt thou for ever be angry with us? Wilt thou prolong thy wrath from
   age to age?

   6 Wilt not thou being turned to us quicken us? And thy people will
   rejoice in thee.

   7 Show us, O Jehovah! thy mercy; and thy salvation grant unto us.

   8 I will hear what God Jehovah will speak: Surely he will speak peace
   to his people and to his meek ones, And they will not return to folly.

   9 Surely near to those who fear him is his salvation, That dwell may
   glory in our land.

   10 Mercy and truth shall meet together; Righteousness and peace shall
   kiss [each other.]

   11 Truth out of the earth shall spring up; And righteousness from
   heaven shall look down.

   12 Likewise Jehovah will give that which is good: And our land shall
   yield her increase.

   13 Righteousness before him shall go; And shall set in the way her
   steps.

   PSALM 86

   A Prayer of David

   1 Incline, O Jehovah, thy ear, answer me; For poor and needy am I.

   2 Keep my soul, for I am meek: O thou, my God! save thy servant who
   trusteth in thee.

   3 Have compassion upon me, O Jehovah! For to thee do I cry daily.

   4 Gladden the soul of thy servant; For to thee, O Lord! my soul I lift
   up.

   5 For thou, O Lord! art good, and gracious, Plenteous in mercy to all
   who call upon thee.

   6 Listen, O Jehovah! to my prayer, Attend to the voice of my
   supplications.

   7 In the day of my trouble I will cry to thee: For thou wilt answer me.

   8 There is none like unto thee, O Lord! among the gods; And there is
   none [who can work] according to thy works.

   9 All the nations which thou hast made shall come, And shall worship
   before thy face, O Lord! And glory they shall give to thy name:

   10 For great art thou, And doing wonders, thou God alone.

   11 Show me, O Jehovah! thy ways; I will walk in thy truth: Unite my
   heart to fear thy name.

   12 I will celebrate thee, O Lord my God! with my whole heart; And I
   will glorify thy name for ever;

   13 For thy mercy hath been great towards me; And thou hast delivered my
   soul from the lower grave.

   14 O God! the proud have risen up against me, And a company of mighty
   men have sought after my soul; And they have not set thee before them.

   15 And thou, O Lord! [art] a God compassionate and gracious; Slow to
   anger; and plenteous in mercy and truth.

   16 Look to me, and have pity upon me: Give thy strength to thy servant,
   And save the son of thy handmaid.

   17 Make with me a sign for good: And see shall my adversaries and be
   ashamed; For thou, O Jehovah! hast secured me and comforted me.

   PSALM 88

   A Song of a Psalm of the sons of Korah. To the Chief Musician, upon
   Machalath, to make humble. An instruction of Heman the Ezrahite

   1 O Jehovah! God of my salvation! By day I cry, by night before thee.

   2 Come into thy presence let my prayer; Incline thy ear to my cry;

   3 For filled with troubles is my soul; And my life to hell [354] hath
   drawn near.

   4 I am counted with those who go down to the sepulcher, [355] I have
   been as a man who hath no strength:

   5 Free among the dead, As the slain lying in the grave, Whom thou
   rememberest no more, And who from thy hand are cut off.

   6 Thou hast laid me in the lowest pit, In thick darkness, in the deeps.

   7 Upon me lieth heavy thy indignation; And with all thy waves thou hast
   afflicted me. Selah.

   8 Thou hast removed my acquaintances from me: Thou hast made me
   abominations to them: I am shut up that I cannot go forth.

   9 My eye mourneth because of my affliction; I invoke thee, O Jehovah!
   daily: I stretch out to thee my hands.

   10 Wilt thou for the dead do a miracle? Shall the dead rising up praise
   thee? Selah.

   11 Shall thy loving-kindness be declared in the grave? Thy truth in
   destruction?

   12 Shall thy wonders be known in darkness? And thy righteousness in the
   land of forgetfulness?

   13 But as for me to thee, O Jehovah! have I cried, And in the morning
   my prayer shall prevent thee.

   14 Wherefore, O Jehovah! wilt thou reject my soul? [Wherefore] wilt
   thou hide thy face from me?

   15 Afflicted am I, and ready to die from my youth; I have suffered thy
   terrors by doubting.

   16 Passed over me hath thy fierce wrath: Thy terrors have cut me off.

   17 They have encompassed me as waters daily; They have surrounded me
   together.

   18 Thou hast removed from me lover and companion; And my acquaintances
   are darkness.

   PSALM 89

   An Instruction of Ethan, the Ezrahite

   1 The mercies of Jehovah for ever will I sing: From generation to
   generation will I celebrate thy truth with my mouth.

   2 For I have said, For ever Mercy shall be built up: The heavens thou
   shalt establish; thy truth [is] in them.

   3 "I have made a covenant with my chosen: "I have sworn to David my
   servant:

   4 "For ever will I establish thy seed, "And I will build up from age to
   age thy throne." Selah.

   5 And celebrate shall the heavens thy wondrous work, O Jehovah! Also
   thy truth in the congregation of the saints.

   6 For who in the clouds can be compared to Jehovah? Who is like unto
   Jehovah among the sons of the gods?

   7 God is terrible exceedingly in the assembly of the saints, And to be
   feared above all who are around him.

   8 O Jehovah, God of armies! who is a strong God like thee? And thy
   truth is round about thee.

   9 Thou governest the pride of the sea: When rise up do the waves
   thereof, thou restrainest them.

   10 Thou hast overthrown Egypt as a wounded mail; With the arm of thy
   strength thou hast scattered thy enemies.

   11 Thine are the heavens, thine also is the earth: The world, and the
   fullness thereof thou hast formed. [356]

   12 The north and the south thou hast created: Tabor and Hermon in thy
   name shall exult.

   13 Thou hast an arm of might: Thou wilt strengthen thy hand, Thou wilt
   exalt thy right hand.

   14 Righteousness and judgment are the seat of thy throne: Mercy and
   truth shall go before thy face.

   15 Blessed is the people that know the joyful sound! O Jehovah! in the
   brightness of thy countenance they shall walk.

   16 In thy name shall they exult daily; And in thy righteousness shall
   they glory:

   17 For the glory of their strength art thou; And in thy favor exalted
   shall be our horn.

   18 For to Jehovah is our buckler; And to the Holy One of Israel is our
   King.

   19 Then thou spakest in vision to thy meek ones, And saidst, "I have
   laid help upon a Mighty One; "I have exalted one chosen from among the
   people.

   20 "I have found David my servant; "With the oil of my holiness have I
   anointed him.

   21 "Therefore, my hand shall be established with him: "Yea, my arm
   shall strengthen him.

   22 "The enemy shall not exact upon him, "Nor shall the son of iniquity
   afflict him.

   23 "And I will break in pieces before his face his oppressors; "And
   those who hate him I will smite.

   24 "And my truth and my mercy shall be with him: "And in my name
   exalted shall be his horn.

   25 "And I will set in the sea his hand, "And in the rivers his right
   hand.

   26 "He shall cry to me, My Father art thou, "My God, the Rock of my
   salvation.'

   27 "Also I myself my firstborn will make him, "Higher than the kings of
   the earth.

   28 "And for ever will I keep for him my mercy, "And my covenant shall
   stand firm with him.

   29 "And I will establish for ever his seed, "And his throne as the days
   of heaven.

   30 "If forsake shall his children my law, "And in my judgments shall
   not walk;

   31 "If my ordinances they shall profane, "And my statutes they shall
   not keep;

   32 "Then will I visit with my rod their transgressions, "And with
   stripes their iniquity.

   33 "But my mercy will I not withdraw from him; "Nor will I be false in
   my truth.

   34 "I will not profane my covenant, "And that which is gone forth from
   my lips I will not alter.

   35 "Once have I sworn by my holiness, "If to David I lie --

   36 "His seed for ever shall endure; "And his throne as the sun before
   me.

   37 "As the moon it shall be established for ever, "And [as] a faithful
   witness in the heaven." Selah.

   38 But thou, even thou, hast abhorred and rejected him; Thou hast been
   wroth with thy anointed.

   39 Thou hast made to cease the covenant of thy servant; Thou hast
   profaned to the earth his crown.

   40 Thou hast broken down all his walls; Thou hast made his fortresses a
   ruin.

   41 Plundered him have all who pass by the way: He hath been a reproach
   to his neighbors.

   42 Thou hast exalted the right hand of his oppressors; Thou hast made
   glad all his adversaries.

   43 Also thou hast blunted the edge of his sword, And hast not made him
   to stand in battle.

   44 Thou hast effaced his splendor, And his throne to the ground thou
   hast east down.

   45 Thou hast shortened the days of his youth; Thou hast covered him
   with disgrace. Selah.

   46 How long, O Jehovah! wilt thou hide thyself for ever? Burn like fire
   shall thy indignation?

   47 Remember how short-lived I am! [357] Wherefore in vain shouldst thou
   have created all the sons of men?

   48 What man shall live, and shall not see death? And shall deliver his
   soul from the hand of the grave? Selah.

   49 Where are thy former compassions, O Lord? Thou hast sworn to David
   in thy truth.

   50 Remember, O Lord! the reproach of thy servants: I have sustained in
   my bosom all those [reproaches] of the mighty peoples,

   51 With which thy enemies have reproached thee, O Jehovah! With which
   they have reproached the footsteps of thy Messiah.

   52 Blessed be Jehovah for evermore. Amen and Amen!

   PART FOURTH. [358]

   PSALM 90

   A Psalm of Moses, the man of God

   1 O Lord! a dwelling-place thou hast been to us from generation to
   generation.

   2 Before the mountains were brought forth, And [before] thou hadst
   formed the earth and the world, Even from everlasting to everlasting,
   thou art God.

   3 Thou shalt turn man to destruction, And shalt say, "Return ye sons of
   Adam."

   4 For a thousand years in thy sight are as yesterday when it is past,
   And as a watch in the night.

   5 Thou overflowest them; [359] they will be a sleep: In the morning as
   grass he shall grow.

   6 In the morning he (or it) shall flourish and grow: At the evening he
   (or it) shall be cut down, and shall wither.

   7 For we fail by thy anger, And by thy indignation are we affrighted.

   8 Thou hast set our iniquities before thee, Our secret sins in the
   light of thy countenance.

   9 For all our days are passed away in thy indignation: We have spent
   our years as if a thought.

   10 In the days of our years there are seventy years; And if through
   strength, eighty years, Yet is their pride [but] grief and labor; For
   it passeth by quickly, and we fly away.

   11 Who knoweth the power of thy anger? And according to thy fear is thy
   wrath.

   12 Teach us so to number our days, And we shall apply our heart to
   wisdom.

   13 Return, O Jehovah! how long? Be pacified towards thy servants.

   14 Satiate us early with thy goodness, And we will exult and rejoice
   all our days.

   15 Make us joyful according to the days of our affliction; According to
   the years in which we have seen evil.

   16 Let thy work appear towards thy servants, And thy glory upon their
   children.

   17 And let there be the beauty of the Lord our God upon us; And the
   work of our hands direct thou upon us; Yea, the work of our hands
   direct thou.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [358] According to the Hebrew division, Part 4 extends from Psalm 90 to
   Psalm 106 inclusive.

   [359] In the French version it is, "Thou carriest them away as do
   floods of water."

   PSALM 91

   1 He who dwelleth in the secret place of the Most High, Under the
   shadow of the Almighty shall abide.

   2 I will say to Jehovah, "Thou art my hope and my fortress:" He is my
   God; I will hope in him.

   3 Surely he shall deliver thee from the snare of the fowler, From the
   noxious pestilence:

   4 With his wings he shall protect thee; And under his feathers thou
   shalt be safe; Thy shield and thy buckler shall be his truth.

   5 Thou shalt not be afraid at the terror of the night; At the arrow
   which flieth by day;

   6 At the destruction which in darkness walketh: At the pestilence which
   wasteth at noon-day.

   7 There shall fall at thy side a thousand, And ten thousand at thy
   right hand: To thee it shall not come nigh.

   8 Only with thine eyes shalt thou behold, And the reward of the ungodly
   thou shalt see.

   9 Because thou, O Jehovah! art my protection; The Most High thou hast
   made thy refuge.

   10 There shall not befall thee [any] evil, And the plague shall not
   come nigh thy tabernacle:

   11 For to his angels he hath given charge concerning thee, To keep thee
   in all thy ways.

   12 Upon their hands they shall bear thee, Lest thou dash against a
   stone thy foot.

   13 Over the lion and asp thou shalt walk; Thou shalt tread upon the
   young lion and dragon.

   14 Because on me he hath reposed, I will deliver him; I will exalt him
   because he hath known my name.

   15 He will call upon me, and I will answer him: With him will I be in
   trouble; I will deliver him, and will glorify him.

   16 With length of days will I satisfy him, And will show him my
   salvation.
     __________________________________________________________________

   PSALM 92

   1 It is good to give thanks to Jehovah, To sing psalms to thy name, O
   Most High!

   2 To proclaim in the morning thy goodness, And thy truth in the night.

   3 Upon the psaltery, and upon the nablum, [360] Upon higgaion with the
   harp. [361]

   4 For thou hast made me glad, O Jehovah! in thy works; In the works of
   thy hands I will exult.

   5 How magnificent are thy works, O Jehovah! Exceeding deep are thy
   thoughts.

   6 The man that is foolish shall not know them, Neither shall he who is
   void of wisdom understand them.

   7 When the wicked flourish as the grass, And all the workers of
   iniquity spring up, [It is] that they may perish for ever.

   8 But thou art exalted for evermore, O Jehovah!

   9 For lo! thine enemies, O Jehovah! For lo! thine enemies shall perish;
   Scattered shall be all the workers of iniquity:

   10 But thou shalt exalt my horn like that of the unicorn. I am anointed
   with fresh oil.

   11 And mine eye shall see [ruin] on my oppressors: [Of destruction,] on
   those who rise up against me -- On those who trouble me hear shall my
   ears.

   12 The righteous as the palm tree shall flourish, As the cedar in
   Lebanon he shall be multiplied.

   13 Planted in the house of Jehovah, In the courts of our God, they
   shall flourish.

   14 Still shall they bud forth in old age; Fat and green shall they be;

   15 That they may proclaim that upright is Jehovah, my Rock, And that
   there is no iniquity in him.

   1 Jehovah hath reigned, He hath put on glory, Put on hath Jehovah
   strength; He hath girded himself: Also he hath established the world,
   It shall not be moved.

   2 Fixed is thy throne; [Even as] from that time [362] thou art, and
   from eternity. [363]

   3 Raised have the floods, O Jehovah! Raised have the floods their
   voice; Raise shall the floods their waves.

   4 By reason of the voices [364] of the great waters Terrible are the
   waves of the sea: Terrible on high is Jehovah.

   PSALM 94

   1 O Jehovah! God of vengeances! O God of vengeances! shine forth.

   2 Lift up thyself; O judge of the earth! Render a reward to the proud.

   3 How long shall the ungodly, O Jehovah! How long shall the ungodly
   triumph?

   4 They pour forth, they speak hard things, Extol themselves do all the
   workers of iniquity.

   5 Thy people, O Jehovah! they break in pieces; And thy inheritance they
   afflict:

   6 The widow, and the stranger they slay, And the orphans they put to
   death.

   7 And they have said, "God shall not see, "The God of Jacob shall not
   know.."

   8 Understand, ye stupid among the people! And ye fools! when will ye be
   wise?

   9 He who planted the ear shall not He hear? He who formed the eye,
   shall not He see?

   10 He who chastiseth the nations, shall not He correct? He who teacheth
   man knowledge?

   11 Jehovah knoweth the thoughts of men that they are vain.

   12 Blessed is the man whom thou hast instructed, O God! And out of thy
   law hast taught;

   13 To give him rest from days of evil, Whilst there is digged for the
   ungodly [man] a pit.

   14 Surely Jehovah will not cast off his people, And his inheritance he
   will not forsake.

   15 For return shall judgment unto righteousness, And [follow] after him
   shall all the upright in heart.

   16 Who will rise up for me against my adversaries? Who will stand up
   for me against the workers of iniquity?

   17 Unless Jehovah had been a help to me, My soul had well-nigh dwelt in
   silence.

   18 If I said, "Slidden hath my foot," Thy goodness, O Jehovah! hath
   sustained me.

   19 In the multitude of my thoughts, Within me thy comforts cheer my
   soul.

   20 Shall the throne of iniquities have fellowship with thee, Framing
   molestation for law?

   21 They will gather together against the soul of the righteous, And the
   blood of the innocent they will condemn.

   22 But Jehovah hath been to me for a fortress; And my God for the rock
   of my confidence:

   23 And he shall retribute upon them their own iniquity, And in their
   wickedness he shall destroy them; Destroy them shall Jehovah our God.

   PSALM 95

   1 Come let us exult to Jehovah; Let us shout for joy to the Rock of our
   salvation.

   2 Let us come before his face with praise, In psalms let us shout for
   joy unto him.

   3 For a great God is Jehovah, And a great King, above all gods.

   4 For in his hand are the deep places of the earth; And the heights of
   the mountains are his.

   5 For his is the sea, and he made it; And the dry land his hands
   formed.

   6 Come ye, let us worship, and fall down; Let us kneel before the face
   of Jehovah, our Maker.

   7 For he is our God, And we [are] the people of his pastures, And the
   flock of his hand; To-day, if his voice ye will hear,

   8 Harden not your heart, as in Meribah; As in the day of Massah in the
   desert,

   9 When tempt me did your fathers; They proved me, though they had seen
   my work.

   10 Forty years I strove with this generation, And said, "They are a
   people erring in heart, "And they have not known my ways."

   11 Wherefore I swear in my wrath, "If they shall enter into my rest --"

   4 For great is Jehovah, and to be praised highly; Terrible [is] he

   5 For all the gods of the nations are vanities; But Jehovah made the
   heavens.

   6 Strength and majesty go before him; Power and glory are in his
   sanctuary.

   7 Ascribe to Jehovah, O ye congregations of peoples! Ascribe to Jehovah
   glory and strength.

   enemies.

   4 Enlighten did his lightnings the world; See and tremble shall the
   earth.

   5 The mountains like wax melted at the presence of Jehovah, At the
   presence of the Lord of the whole earth.

   6 Declared have the heavens his righteousness, And seen have all the
   peoples his glory.

   7 Confounded be all those who serve graven images, Who glory in their
   inventions: Worship before him let all the gods.

   8 Heard and rejoiced hath Zion; Exulted have the daughters of Judah,
   Because of thy judgments, O Jehovah!

   9 For thou, O Jehovah! art high above all the earth: Exceedingly
   exalted art thou above all gods.

   10 Ye who love Jehovah, hate evil: He preserveth the souls of his meek
   ones; From the hand of the ungodly he will deliver them.

   3 I will not set before my eyes a wicked thing; The work of those who
   turn aside I hate; It shall not adhere to me.

   4 A heart perverse shall depart from me; Evil I will not know.

   5 He who slandereth in secret his neighbor, him will I destroy: The
   lofty in look and the wide in heart him I will not suffer.

   6 My eyes shall be upon the faithful of the land, That they may dwell
   with me: He who walketh in an upright way, [Even] he shall minister to
   me.

   7 He shall not dwell in the midst of my house, he who worketh deceit;
   He who speaketh lies shall not be established before my eyes.

   8 Early will I destroy all the ungodly of the land; That I may cut off

   PSALM 102

   A Prayer for the afflicted when he shall be shut up, and shall pour out
   his meditation before Jehovah

   1 O Jehovah! hear my prayer, And let my cry to thee come.

   2 Hide not thy face from me in the day of my afflictions; Incline to me
   thy ear; In the day when I cry, make haste, answer me.

   3 For consumed like smoke are [367] my days, And my bones as a hearth
   are burnt up.

   4 Smitten like grass, and withered is my heart, Because I have
   forgotten to eat my bread.

   5 By reason of the voice of my groaning, Cleave do my bones to my
   flesh.

   6 I am become like a pelican of the desert, I am become as an owl of
   the solitudes;

   7 I have watched and am as the sparrow Which is solitary upon the roof
   of the house.

   8 Daily reproach me do my enemies; And those who are mad against me, by
   me have sworn.

   9 For ashes as bread I have eaten, And my drink with weeping [368] I
   have mingled.

   10 Because of thy indignation and thy wrath; For thou hast lifted me up
   and cast me down.

   11 My days are as a shadow which declineth; And as grass I am dried up.

   12 And thou, O Jehovah! for ever shalt dwell, And thy memorial from
   generation to generation.

   13 Thou thyself shalt arise, thou shalt have mercy upon Zion; For it is
   time to compassionate her, For come is the appointed time.

   14 For take pleasure do thy servants in her stones, And upon her dust
   they will have compassion.

   15 And fear shall the Gentiles the name of Jehovah, And all the kings
   of the earth thy glory.

   16 For Jehovah hath builded Zion, He hath appeared in his glory.

   17 He hath regarded the prayer of the solitary, And hath not despised
   their prayer.

   18 This shall be written for the generation to come, And the people [to
   be] created shall praise him.

   19 For he hath looked from the high place of his holiness, Jehovah from
   the heavens upon the earth hath looked,

   20 To hear the groaning of the prisoners To release the sons of death;

   21 That declared in Zion may be the name of Jehovah, And his praise in
   Jerusalem;

   22 When gathered shall be the peoples together, And the kingdoms to
   serve Jehovah.

   23 He hath afflicted in the way my strength, He hath shortened my days.

   24 I said, O my God! take me not away in the midst of my days; For
   throughout generations of generations are thy years.

   25 Aforetime the earth thou hast founded; And the work of thy hands
   serve the heavens.

   26 They shall perish but thou shalt endure; And they all as a garment
   shall grow old; As a vesture thou shalt change them, and they shall be
   changed.

   27 But thou art always the same, And thy years shall not fail.

   28 The children of thy servants shall dwell, And their seed before thee

   PSALM 103

   Of David

   1 Bless, O my soul! Jehovah, And all my inward parts bless his holy
   name.

   2 Bless, O my soul! Jehovah, And forget not all his bounties.

   3 Who forgiveth all thy iniquities; Who healeth all thy infirmities;

   4 Who redeemeth from the grave thy life; Who crowneth thee with mercy
   and compassions;

   5 Who satisfieth with good thy mouth: Renewed as that of the eagle
   shall be thy youth.

   6 Execute doth Jehovah righteousness And judgments for all who are
   oppressed.

   7 He made known his ways to Moses, To the children of Israel his
   doings.

   8 Compassionate and merciful is Jehovah, Slow to anger and abundant in
   goodness.

   9 He will not always chide; Neither for ever will he keep [his anger.]

   10 Not according to our sins hath he dealt with us, Nor according to
   our iniquities hath he recompensed us.

   11 For in proportion to the height of the heavens above the earth, Hath
   been the greatness of his goodness upon those who fear him.

   12 As far distant as is the east from the west, So far hath he removed
   from us our sills.

   13 As a father is compassionate towards his children, So is Jehovah
   compassionate towards those who fear him.

   14 For he knoweth of what we are made; He hath remembered that dust are
   we.

   15 Man... as grass are his days: As a flower of the field, so he
   flourisheth.

   16 As soon as the wind passeth over it, it is not; And know it no more
   shall the place thereof.

   17 But the goodness of Jehovah is from everlasting to everlasting upon
   those who fear him, And his righteousness upon the children's children;

   18 To those who keep his covenant, And are mindful of his statutes to
   do them.

   19 Jehovah in the heavens hath established his throne; And his kingdom
   over all hath dominion.

   20 Bless Jehovah, ye his angels mighty in strength! Who do his
   commandment, in hearing the voice of his word.

   21 Bless Jehovah, all ye his armies! Ye ministers of his, who do his
   pleasure.

   22 Bless Jehovah, all ye his works! In all places of his dominion:
   Bless, O my soul! Jehovah.

   PSALM 104

   1 Bless, O my soul! Jehovah: O Jehovah, my God! thou art great
   exceedingly; With praise and honor thou hast clothed thyself.

   2 Being arrayed with light as with a garment; Spreading out the heavens
   as a curtain;

   3 Flooring in the waters his upper rooms; Making the clouds his
   chariot; Walking upon the wings of the wind:

   4 Making the winds his messengers; His ministers a fire that flameth.

   5 He hath founded the earth upon its foundations, So that it shall not
   be moved for ever.

   6 With the deep as with a garment he hath covered it: Above the
   mountains stand shall the waters.

   7 At thy rebuke they shall flee; At the voice of thy thunder they shall
   suddenly pass away.

   8 Ascend shall the mountains and descend shall the valleys To the place
   which thou hast founded for them.

   9 A boundary thou hast set, they shall not pass over it: They shall not
   return to cover the earth.

   10 Sending out springs by the valleys, Which between the hills shall
   run.

   11 Drink thereof shall all the beasts of the field: Quench shall the
   wild asses their thirst.

   12 Nigh time the fowl of the heaven shall dwell, From the midst of the
   branches they shall send out their voice.

   13 Watering the mountains from his chambers: From the fruit of thy
   works satisfied shall be the earth.

   14 Making grass to grow for cattle, And herb for the service of mm:
   That he may bring forth bread out of the earth.

   15 And wine cheereth the heart of man, To make his face to shine with
   oil, And bread sustaineth the heart of man.

   16 Satiated shall be the trees of Jehovah; The cedars of Lebanon which
   he hath planted:

   17 For there the birds build their nests: [As for] the stork, the fir
   trees are her dwelling.

   18 The high mountains are for the deer; The rocks a place of shelter
   for the hedgehogs.

   19 He hath made the moon for set times: The sun knoweth his going down.

   20 Thou makest darkness, and it is night; Wherein do creep forth all
   the beasts of the forest.

   21 The lions roar after their prey, And in seeking from God their food.

   22 Rise shall the sun, and they shall gather themselves together, And
   in their dens shall lie down.

   23 Go forth shall man to his work, And to his labor, until the evening.

   24 How magnificent are thy works! O Jehovah! All things in wisdom thou
   hast made: Filled is the earth with thy riches.

   25 This sea great, and wide in extent; Therein are creeping things
   inntanerable, Beasts both small and great.

   26 There the ships go, And the leviathan, which thou hast formed to
   sport in it.

   27 All things on thee do wait, That thou mayest give them their food in
   its season.

   28 Thou shalt give it them, they shall gather [it:] Thou shalt open thy
   hand, they shall be satisfied with good.

   29 Thou shalt hide thy face, they shall be afraid: Thou shalt take away
   their spirit, they shall die, and to their dust shall return.

   30 Thou shalt send forth thy Spirit, they shall be created: And thou
   shalt renew the face of the earth.

   31 Glory be to Jehovah for ever: Rejoice let Jehovah in his works.

   32 He looketh upon the earth, and it trembleth: If he touch the
   mountains, they shall smoke.

   33 I will sing to Jehovah whilst I live: I will sing psalms to my God
   as long as I have my being.

   34 Let my speech be acceptable to him: I will rejoice in Jehovah.

   35 Perish let sinners from the earth, And the ungodly till they cease
   to be any more. Bless, O my soul! Jehovah. Hallelujah.

   PSALM 105

   1 Celebrate ye Jehovah; invoke his name: Announce among the peoples his
   works.

   2 Sing ye to him: sing psalms to him: Speak of all his wonders.

   3 Rejoice ye in his holy name: Rejoice let the heart of those who seek
   Jehovah.

   4 Seek ye Jehovah, and his strength; Seek his face continually.

   5 Remember the marvelous works which he hath done; His wonders, and the
   judgments of his mouth.

   6 Ye seed of Abraham, his servant, The sons of Jacob his chosen one:

   7 He is Jehovah our God; Through all the earth are his judgments.

   8 He hath remembered for ever his covenant, The word which he commanded
   to a thousand generations:

   9 Which he made with Abraham, And his oath which he swore to Isaac;

   10 And established it to Jacob for a law, To Israel for an everlasting
   covenant:

   11 Saying, "To thee will I give the land of Canaan, "The cord of your
   inheritance."

   12 When they were very few in number; And strangers in it;

   13 And walked about from nation to nation, From one kingdom to another
   people,

   14 He did not suffer men to hurt them; And rebuked for their sake
   kings;

   15 Saying, "Touch not my anointed ones, "And to my prophets do no
   harm."

   16 And he called a famine upon the land; All the stall of bread he
   broke.

   17 He sent before them a man, For a slave sold was Joseph.

   18 They afflicted in the fetters his feet: The iron entered into his
   soul:

   19 Until the time that his word came: The word of Jehovah tried him.

   20 Send did the king and loosed him; Even the ruler of the peoples, and
   freed him.

   21 He made him lord over his house; And ruler over all his substance:

   22 To bind his princes at his pleasure; And to teach his elders wisdom.

   23 And come did Israel into Egypt; And Jacob sojourned in the land of
   Ham.

   24 And he increased his people exceedingly, He multiplied them above
   their oppressors.

   25 He turned their heart so that they hated his people, And dealt
   craftily with his servants.

   26 He sent Moses, his servant; Aaron, whom he chose.

   27 They set among them the words of his signs, And his miracles in the
   land of Ham.

   28 He sent darkness, and made it dark; And they were not rebellious
   against his words.

   29 He turned their waters into blood, And killed their fish.

   30 Their land brought forth frogs, Yea even within the chambers of
   their kings.

   31 He spake and there came a swarm of flies, Lice in all their borders.

   32 He gave them for rain, hail, Flaming fire upon their land.

   33 And he smote their vines and their fig-trees; And destroyed every
   tree of their border.

   34 He spake, and there came the locust, And the caterpillar without
   number;

   35 And they devoured all the herbage in their land, And consumed the
   fruit of their ground.

   36 And he smote all the firstborn in their land, The beginning of all
   their strength.

   37 And he brought them forth with silver and gold: And not one among
   their tribes was a feeble person.

   38 Glad was Egypt at their departure; For fallen upon them had their
   terror.

   39 He spread out a cloud for a covering; And fire to give light by the
   night.

   40 He [369] asked, and brought quails, And with the bread of heaven he
   filled them.

   41 He opened the rock, and there gushed out waters; They ran in the dry
   places like a river.

   42 For he remembered the word of his holiness, Which he had spoken to
   Abraham his servant.

   43 And he brought forth his people with joy, With exultation his chosen
   ones.

   44 And he gave them the lands of the nations: And the labor of the
   peoples they inherited.

   45 That they might keep his ordinances, And that his law they might
   observe. Hallelujah.

   PSALM 106

   Hallelujah

   1 Celebrate Jehovah, for he is good; For to everlasting is his mercy.

   2 Who shall express the mighty acts of Jehovah? Who shall declare all
   his praise?

   3 Blessed are they who keep judgment, Blessed is he who doeth
   righteousness at all times.

   4 Remember me, O Jehovah! with the good will [which thou bearest
   towards] thy people. Visit me with thy salvation;

   5 That I may see the good of thy chosen ones, That I may rejoice in the
   joy of thy nation, That I may glory with thy heritage.

   6 We have sinned with our fathers, We have acted iniquitously, we have
   done wickedly.

   7 Our fathers in Egypt understood not thy wonders; They remembered not
   the multitude of thy kindnesses; And they rebelled at the sea, at the
   Red Sea.

   8 Yet he saved them for the sake of his own name, That he might cause
   to be known his power.

   9 And he rebuked the Red Sea, and it was dried up; And he made them
   walk in the deeps as in a desert.

   10 And he saved them from the hand of the enemy, And redeemed them from
   the hand of the adversary.

   11 And cover did the waters their oppressors: One of them was not left.

   12 Then they believed his words; They sang his praise.

   13 They made haste, they forgat his works; They did not wait for his
   counsel;

   14 And they lusted greatly in the desert, And tempted God in the
   wilderness.

   15 And he gave them their request; But sent leanness into their souls.

   16 And they envied Moses in the camp, And Aaron, the saint of Jehovah.

   17 Open did the earth and swallowed up Dathan, And covered over the
   tent of Abiram.

   18 And kindled was a fire in their company, The flame burned up the
   ungodly.

   19 They made a calf in Horeb, And worshipped before the molten image.

   20 And they changed their glory Into the likeness of an ox that eateth
   hay.

   21 They forgat God their Savior, Who had done great things in Egypt;

   22 Miracles in the land of Ham, Terrible things at the Red Sea.

   23 And he said that he would destroy them, Unless Moses his chosen had
   stood in the breach before his face, To turn away his wrath, that he
   might not destroy them

   24 And they despised the land of pleasantness; They believed not his
   word;

   25 And they mutinied in their tents, They hearkened not to the voice of
   Jehovah.

   26 And he lifted tip his hand against them, To destroy them in the
   desert:

   27 And to scatter their seed among the heathen, And to disperse them
   throughout the lands.

   28 And they joined themselves to Baal-peor, And ate the sacrifices of
   things dead.

   29 And they provoked God to anger by their works: And break in upon
   them did the plague.

   30 Then stood up Phinehas, and executed judgment: And stayed was the
   plague.

   31 And that was imputed to him for righteousness From generation to
   generation, even for ever.

   32 And they provoked him to anger at the waters of strife, And it
   turned out in to Moses on their account:

   33 For they embittered his spirit, And he spake [rashly] with his lips.

   34 They did not destroy the nations, As Jehovah had commanded them:

   35 And they were mingled with the heathen, And learned their works:

   36 And they served their idols; Which were to them for ruin.

   37 And they sacrificed their sons and their daughters to demons;

   38 And they shed innocent blood, The blood of their sons and of their
   daughters, Whom they sacrificed to the idols of Canaan; And polluted
   was the land with bloods.

   39 And they were defiled in their own works, And were adulterous in
   their own inventions.

   40 Then [370] burn did the wrath of Jehovah against his people, And he
   abhorred his inheritance;

   41 And he delivered them into the hands of the heathen; And those had
   dominion over them who hated them:

   42 And subdue them did their enemies, And they were afflicted under
   their hand.

   43 Many times did he deliver them; But they provoked him with their
   counsels, And were oppressed in their iniquity.

   44 Yet he saw when they were in distress, And heard their cry:

   45 And he remembered towards them his covenant; And it repented him
   according to the greatness of his mercies.

   46 And he made them to find pity Before all who had led them captive.

   47 Save us, O Jehovah, our God! And gather us from among the heathen,
   That we may celebrate thy holy name, That we may glory in thy praise.

   48 Blessed be Jehovah, the God of Israel, From everlasting to
   everlasting; And say let all the people, Amen. Praise ye Jehovah.

   PART FIFTH. [371]

   PSALM 107

   1 "Celebrate Jehovah, for he is good, "For to everlasting is his
   mercy."

   2 Say this let the redeemed of Jehovah, Whom he hath redeemed from the
   hand of the afflicter.

   3 Whom he hath gathered from the lands, From the east, and from the
   west, From the north, and from the south.

   4 They wandered from the way in the solitary desert; A city of
   habitation they found not:

   5 Hungry, also thirsty, So that their soul within them fainted.

   6 Then they cried to Jehovah in their distress, And from their troubles
   he delivered them.

   7 And he directed them by a right way, That they might come to a city
   of habitation.

   8 Let them celebrate before Jehovah his mercy, His marvelous works
   before the sons of men.

   9 For he hath satisfied the soul that longeth, And the soul that is
   famished he hath filled with good.

   10 Those who dwell in darkness, and in the shadow of death, Bound in
   affliction and iron;

   11 Because they rebelled against the words of God, And the counsel of
   the Most High they despised:

   12 And he humbled with trouble their heart; They were afflicted and
   there was none to help them

   13 They cried to Jehovah in their distress: From their troubles he
   delivered them.

   14 He rescued them from darkness and the shadow of death, And their
   chains he broke asunder.

   15 Let them celebrate before Jehovah his mercy, And his marvelous works
   before the sons of men.

   16 For he hath broken the gates of brass, And the bars of iron he hath
   shivered.

   17 Fools on account of the way of their transgression; And on account
   of their iniquities are afflicted.

   18 All food loathe doth their soul; And they approach the gates of
   death.

   19 Then they cry to Jehovah in their trouble: From their straits he
   sayeth them.

   20 He sendeth his word, and healeth them, And rescueth them from all
   their corruptions.

   21 Let them celebrate before Jehovah his mercy, And his marvelous works
   before the sons of men.

   22 And let them sacrifice sacrifices of praise, And announce his works
   with exultation.

   23 Those who go down to the sea in ships, Trading in the great waters,

   24 These men see the works of Jehovah, His wonders in the deep.

   25 He speaketh and raiseth the wind of storm, And lifteth high the
   waves thereof.

   26 They mount up to the heavens, They descend into the deeps; Their
   soul in [372] their distress is melted away.

   27 They are tossed and stagger as a drunken man, And all their skill is
   swallowed up.

   28 And they cry to Jehovah in their distress, And from their troubles
   he bringeth them out.

   29 He maketh the storm a calm, So that quiet are the waves thereof.

   30 And they rejoice because they are stilled; And he leadeth them unto
   the haven of their desire.

   31 Let them celebrate before Jehovah his mercy, And his wonders before
   the sons of men;

   32 And let them exalt him in the congregation of the people, And in the
   assembly of the elders let them praise him.

   33 He turneth rivers into a desert, And springs of water into dryness;

   34 A land that is fruitful into saltness, For the wickedness of those
   who dwell therein.

   35 He turneth the desert into a pool of water, And the land of
   barrenness into springs of water.

   36 And there he causeth to dwell the famished, That they may prepare a
   city of habitation;

   37 And sow fields, and plant vineyards, And eat the fruit of increase.

   38 And he blesseth them, and they multiply exceedingly; And their
   cattle he doth not diminish,.

   39 Afterwards they are diminished and brought low, By reason of
   anguish, affliction, and sorrow.

   40 He poureth contempt upon princes, And maketh them to wander in the
   waste where there is no path.

   41 And he raiseth the afflicted from his misery, And maketh like a
   flock [his] families.

   42 See shall the upright ones and shall rejoice: And all iniquity shall
   stop her mouth.

   43 Who is wise, and he will observe these things, And they shall
   understand the loving-kindness of Jehovah?

   PSALM 108

   A Song of a Psalm of David

   1 Prepared is my heart, O God! prepared is my heart, I will chant and
   will sing psalms, even with my glory.

   2 Awake, psaltery and harp: I will arise at the dawn of day.

   3 I will celebrate thee, among the peoples, O Jehovah! And will sing
   psalms to thee among the nations:

   4 For great above the heavens, is thy goodness; And unto the clouds is
   thy truth.

   5 Be thou exalted above the heavens, O God! And above all the earth thy
   glory:

   6 That thy beloved ones may be delivered: Save by thy right hand, and
   hear me.

   7 God hath spoken in his holiness; I will rejoice: I will divide
   Shechem, And the valley of Succoth I will measure.

   8 Mine is Gilead, mine is Manasseh; And Ephraim is the strength of my
   head; Judah my lawgiver.

   9 Moab the pot for my washing; Over Edom will I cast my shoe; Over
   Palestina will I triumph.

   10 Who will lead me into the city fortified? Who will lead me even into
   Edom?

   11 Wilt not thou, O God! who hadst cast us off? And [thou] O God! [who]
   didst not go forth with our armies?

   12 Grant us relief from [373] trouble; For vain is the help of man.

   13 Through God we shall do valiantly, And he shall tread down our
   adversaries.

   PSALM 109

   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David

   1 O God of my praise! be not silent;

   2 For the mouth of the ungodly man, and the mouth of deceit upon me are
   opened; They have talked with me with a tongue of guile:

   3 And with words of hatred they have encompassed me, And have fought
   against me without a cause.

   4 [In return] for my love they have been my adversaries; But I set
   myself to prayer.

   5 And they have requited me evil for good, And hatred for my love.

   6 Set thou over him an ungodly man; And let the adversary stand at his
   right hand.

   7 When he is judged let him go forth condemned, [374] And let his
   prayer be turned into sin.

   8 Let his days be few; His office let another receive.

   9 Let his children be fatherless, And his wife a widow.

   10 And in wandering let his children wander and beg, [375] And seek
   [for bread] out of their waste places. [376]

   11 Catch let the extortioner all which he hath, And let strangers
   plunder his labor.

   12 Let there be none prolonging mercy to him; And let there be none to
   have compassion upon his orphans.

   13 Let his posterity be destroyed; [377] In the generation following
   let their name be blotted out.

   14 Remembered let be the iniquity of his fathers before Jehovah; And
   the wickedness [378] of his mother let it not be blotted out.

   15 Let them be before Jehovah continually, And let him blot out from
   the earth their memorial;

   16 Because he remembered not to do mercy, And persecuted the man [that
   was] wretched and poor, And afflicted in heart, to put him to death.

   17 He loved cursing, and let it come upon him: He delighted not in
   blessing, and let it be far from him.

   18 And let him be clothed with cursing as with a garment; And let it
   come as water into his entrails, And as oil into his bones.

   19 Let it be to him as a mantle to cover him, And as a girdle with
   which continually he may gird himself

   20 Let this be the recompense [379] of my adversaries from Jehovah, And
   of those who speak evil against my soul.

   21 But thou, O Jehovah, my Lord! deal thou with me for the sake of thy
   name: Because good is thy mercy, deliver me;

   22 For poor and needy I am, And my heart is wounded within me.

   23 As a shadow when it declineth, I walk about; I am shaken off as the
   locust.

   24 My knees are become feeble through fasting; And my flesh hath fallen
   away from its fatness.

   25 But I am become a reproach to them; When they see me they shake
   their head.

   26 Help me, O Jehovah, my God! Save me according to thy mercy.

   27 And they shall know that this is thy hand, That thou, O Jehovah!
   hast done it.

   28 They shall curse, but thou shalt bless; When they rise up they shall
   be put to shame; But thy servant shall rejoice.

   29 Clothed shall be my adversaries with disgrace, And they shall be
   covered as with a garment with their own shame.

   30 I will praise Jehovah greatly with my mouth; And in the midst of the
   great I will celebrate him:

   31 Because he standeth at the right hand of the poor one, To save from
   condemnations his soul.

   A Psalm of David

   1 Jehovah said to my Lord, "Sit thou at my right hand, "Until I make
   thy enemies thy footstool."

   2 The scepter of thy power send shall Jehovah out of Zion: Rule thou in
   the midst of thy enemies.

   3 Thy people shall come with voluntary offerings, On the day of the
   assembling of thy army, In beauty of holiness: From the womb as from
   the morning dawn To thee has been the dew of thy youth.

   4 Sworn hath Jehovah, and he will not repent: "Thou art a priest for
   ever "According to the manner of Melchisedek."

   5 The Lord at thy right hand Hath crushed in the day of his wrath
   kings.

   6 He shall judge among the heathen, He shall fill all with ruins; He
   shall crush the head over a great country.

   7 Of the torrent in the way he shall drink, Therefore shall he lift up
   the head.

   Hallelujah

   1 ' Blessed is the man who feareth Jehovah; v In his commandments he
   will delight greatly.

   2 g Mighty on the earth shall be his seed: d The generation of the
   upright ones shall be blessed.

   3 h Wealth and riches shall be in his house; v And his righteousness
   endureth for ever.

   4 z There ariseth in darkness light to the upright ones: ch He is
   merciful and compassionate and righteous.

   [381] in uprightness.

   6 k Truly he shall not for ever be moved; l In everlasting remembrance
   shall be the righteous one.

   because he trusteth in Jehovah.

   8 s Sustained is his heart, he shall not be afraid, Until he see his
   desire upon his adversaries.

   righteousness continueth for ever; q His horn shall be exalted with
   glory.

   10 r The ungodly one shall see it, and be incensed; s With his teeth he
   shall gnash and waste away: t The desire of the ungodly ones shall
   perish.

   PSALM 113

   Hallelujah

   1 Praise ye, O ye servants of Jehovah! Praise ye the name of Jehovah.

   2 Let the name of Jehovah be blessed, From henceforth and for ever.

   3 From the rising of the sun even to his going down, Worthy to be
   praised is the name of Jehovah.

   4 High above all nations is Jehovah, Above the heavens is his glory.

   5 Who is like Jehovah our God,

   6 Who hath his dwelling on high, [382] Who humbleth himself to behold
   that which is done in heaven and on earth?

   7 Who raiseth from the dust the needy one; From the dunghill he lifteth
   up the wretched one;

   8 To make him sit with princes, With the princes of his people.

   9 Who causeth the barren woman to dwell with a family, Rejoicing that
   she is a mother of children. Hallelujah.

   PSALM 114

   1 When Israel went forth from Egypt, The house of Jacob from a people
   barbarous;

   2 [Then] was Judah for his holiness, Israel, his dominions.

   3 The sea saw, and fled, Jordan was turned backward.

   4 The mountains leaped as rams, The hills as the lambs of the flock.

   5 What ailed thee, O sea! that thou fleddest? And thou, O Jordan! that
   thou wast turned back?

   6 Ye mountains, that ye leaped like rams; Ye hills, as the lambs of the
   flock?

   7 At the presence of the Lord, tremble, O earth! At the presence of the
   God of Jacob;

   8 Who turned the rock into pools of water, The flinty rock into a
   fountain of waters.

   PSALM 115

   1 Not to us, O Jehovah! not to us, But to thy name give glory, On
   account of thy mercy, on account of thy truth.

   2 Why should the heathen say, "Where is now their God?"

   3 But our God is in the heaven: Whatever pleased him he hath done.

   4 Their idols are silver and gold, The work of the hands of men.

   5 A mouth have they, [383] and they do not speak: Eyes have they, and
   they do not see:

   6 Ears have they, and they do not hear: Noses have they, and they do
   not smell:

   7 Hands have they, and they do not feel: Feet have they, and they do
   not walk: They do not speak through their throat.

   8 Like to them shall be those who make them, And every one who trusteth
   in them.

   9 O Israel! trust thou in Jehovah: Their help and their shield is He:

   10 O house of Aaron! trust in Jehovah: Their help and their shield is
   he:

   11 Ye who fear Jehovah! trust in Jehovah: Their help and their shield
   is He.

   12 Jehovah hath remembered us; he will bless us; He will bless the
   house of Israel; He will bless the house of Aaron.

   13 He will bless those who fear Jehovah, The small together with the
   great.

   14 Jehovah will add to you, To you and to your children.

   15 Blessed are ye of Jehovah, Who made heaven and earth.

   16 The heavens, the heavens are Jehovah's: But the earth he hath given
   to the sons of men.

   17 The dead shall not praise thee, O God! Nor any who go down into
   silence.

   18 But as for us we will bless God, From this time, and even for
   evermore. Hallelujah.

   PSALM 116

   1 I have loved, because heard hath Jehovah the voice of my prayer;

   2 Because he hath inclined his ear to me, When in my straits I called
   upon him. [384]

   3 They encompassed me, the snares of death, And the sorrows of the
   grave found me: Trouble and grief I found.

   4 And on the name of Jehovah I will call: "I beseech thee, O Jehovah!
   deliver my soul."

   5 Merciful is Jehovah and righteous; And our God is compassionate.

   6 Guard doth Jehovah the simple: I was brought low and he saved me.

   7 Return, O my soul! to thy rest; For Jehovah hath dealt kindly with
   thee. [385]

   8 Because thou hast rescued my soul from death My eye from tears, My
   foot from falling.

   9 I will walk before Jehovah in the land of the living.

   10 I have believed, for I will speak: "I am afflicted greatly."

   11 I said in my fear, "Every man is a liar."

   12 What shall I render to Jehovah? All his benefits are upon me.

   13 The cup of salvation I will take, And upon the name of Jehovah I
   will call.

   14 My vows to, Jehovah I will perform Now in the presence of all his
   people.

   15 Precious in the eyes of Jehovah is the death of his meek ones.

   16 Come! O Jehovah! for I, am thy servant; I am thy servant, the son of
   thy handmaid; Thou hast broken my fetters.

   17 To thee will I sacrifice the sacrifice of praise, And upon the name
   of Jehovah will I call.

   18 My vows to Jehovah will I perform Now in the presence of all his
   people,

   19 In the courts of the house of Jehovah In the midst of thee, O
   Jerusalem! Hallelujah.

   PSALM 118

   1 Celebrate ye Jehovah! for he is good: For to everlasting endureth his

   2 Let now Israel say: "For [386] to everlasting endureth his mercy."

   3 Let now the house of Aaron say: "For to everlasting endureth his
   mercy."

   4 Let now those who fear Jehovah say: "For to everlasting endureth his
   mercy."

   5 In my distress I called upon God; God answered me by setting me at
   large.

   6 Jehovah is with me: I will not fear what man can do to me.

   7 Jehovah is with me among those who help me, And I shall see my desire
   upon my adversaries.

   8 It is better to hope in Jehovah Than to place confidence in man:

   9 It is better to hope in Jehovah Than to place confidence in princes.

   10 All the nations encompassed me: But in the name of Jehovah I will
   surely cut them off.

   11 They encompassed me, yea they encompassed me, But in the name of
   Jehovah I will surely cut them off'.

   12 They encompassed me as bees: They were extinguished as a fire of
   thorns: In the name of Jehovah I will surely cut them off.

   13 Thou hast thrust and [387] thrust at me, that I might fall: But
   Jehovah helped me.

   14 My strength and my song is God, And he hath become to me salvation.

   15 The voice of exultation and salvation is in the tabernacles of the
   righteous: The right hand of Jehovah hath done valiantly.

   16 The right hand of Jehovah is exalted, The right hand of Jehovah hath
   done valiantly.

   17 I shall not die, yea, I shall live, And recount the works of God.

   18 Chastised me sorely hath [388] God; But he hath not delivered me up
   unto death.

   19 Open to me the gates of righteousness; And having entered into them,
   I will celebrate God.

   20 This is the gate of Jehovah, The just ones shall enter into it.

   21 I will celebrate thee because thou hast heard me, And hast been my
   salvation.

   22 The stone which the builders rejected Is become the head [stone] of
   the corner.

   23 By Jehovah hath this been done: It is marvelous in our eyes.

   24 This is the day which Jehovah hath made; Let us exult and rejoice in
   it.

   25 I beseech thee, O Jehovah! save me; I beseech thee, I beseech thee,
   O Jehovah! give prosperity I beseech thee.

   26 Blessed is he who cometh in the name of Jehovah: We bless you from
   the house of Jehovah.

   27 God is Jehovah, and he hath given light to us: Bind ye the lamb with
   cords, even to the horns of the altar.

   28 My God art thou, and I will celebrate thee: My God, I will exalt
   thee.

   29 Celebrate ye Jehovah; for he is good: For to everlasting is his
   mercy.

   PSALM 120

   A Song of Degrees

   1 To Jehovah in my distress I cried, And he answered me.

   2 O Jehovah! deliver my soul from the lip of falsehood, From the tongue
   of deceit.

   3 What give thee, and what avail thee Shall the tongue of deceit?

   4 The arrows of a strong man sharpened, With coals of junipers.

   5 Alas for me! that I have been a sojourner in Meseeh, And have dwelt
   among the tents of Kedar.

   6 Long dwelt hath my soul with him who hateth peace.

   7 I [am for] peace; But when I speak, they [are] for war.

   1 I was glad when they said to me, "Into the house of Jehovah we will

   2 "Our feet shall be standing in thy gates, O Jerusalem!"

   3 Jerusalem built as a city, compact in itself together.

   4 Thither ascended the tribes, the tribes of God, For a testimony to
   Israel, To celebrate the name of Jehovah.

   5 For there have sat [393] thrones for judgment, The thrones of the
   house of David.

   6 Pray ye for the peace of Jerusalem: Prosper may those who love thee!

   7 Peace be within thy bulwark! Prosperity within thy towers!

   8 For the sake of my brethren and my neighbors, I will say now, "Peace
   [be] within thee!"

   the eyes of a handmaid look to the hand of her mistress, So our eyes
   [look] to Jehovah our God, Until he have mercy upon us.

   3 Have mercy upon us, O Jehovah! have mercy upon us; For we are

   rich, With the contempt of the proud.

   soul:

   6 Blessed be Jehovah, Who gave us not for a prey to their teeth.

   2 As the mountains are about Jerusalem, So Jehovah is round about his
   people, From henceforth, and for ever.

   3 For rest not shall the scepter of the ungodly ones upon the lot of
   the just, Lest the just ones should put forth to iniquity their hands.

   4 Do good, O Jehovah! to the good, And to those who are upright in

   them walk with the workers of iniquity: But there shall be peace upon

   exultation: Now shall they say among the heathen, "Great things Jehovah
   hath done for them."

   3 Great things Jehovah hath done for us, Whereof we have been made
   glad.

   4 Bring back, O Jehovah! our captivity, As rivers in the South.

   5 They who sow in tears In exultation shall reap.

   2 Vain is it for you early to hasten to rise, To go late to rest, To
   eat the bread of sorrows: For thus will he give to his beloved one
   sleep.

   3 Lo! the heritage of Jehovah are children: The reward which he bestows
   is the fruit of the womb.

   4 As arrows in the hand of a strong man, So are the sons of youth.

   5 Blessed is the man who shall have filled his quiver with them; For

   3 If iniquities thou shouldest mark, O God! O Lord! who shall stand?

   4 For with thee is forgiveness that thou mayest be feared.

   5 I have waited for Jehovah, waited hath my soul; And in his word have

   A Song of Degrees

   1 Remember, O Jehovah! David With all his affliction:

   2 Who sware to Jehovah, [Who] vowed to the Mighty One of Jacob:

   3 "If I shall enter into the tabernacle of my house, "If I shall go up
   upon the covering of my bed,

   4 "If I give sleep to my eyes, "To my eyelids slumber,

   5 "Until I find a place for Jehovah, "Habitations for the mighty God of
   Jacob," -- [397]

   6 Lo! we heard of it at Ephratha; We found it in the fields of the
   wood.

   7 We will enter into his habitations, We will worship at his footstool.

   8 Arise, O Jehovah! into thy rest, Thou and the ark of thy strength.

   9 Let thy priests be clothed with righteousness, And let thy meek ones
   exult.

   10 For the sake of David thy servant Turn not away the face of thy
   Christ.

   11 Sworn hath Jehovah to David in truth, Nor will he turn from it: "Of
   the fruit of thy belly will I set upon thy throne.

   12 "If thy children shall keep my covenant, "And my testimonies, which
   I will teach them; "Also their children for ever shall sit upon thy
   throne."

   13 For chosen hath Jehovah Zion; He hath desired her for a habitation
   to himself.

   14 "This is my rest for ever; "Here will I dwell, because I have loved
   her.

   15 "Her provision blessing I will bless;" Her poor I will satisfy with
   bread.

   16 "And her priests I will clothe with salvation; "And her merciful
   ones with exultation shall exult.

   3 Praise God; for good is Jehovah: Sing to his name; for it is
   pleasant:

   4 For God hath chosen Jacob to himself, Israel for his own possession.

   5 For I know that great is Jehovah, And that our God is above all gods.

   6 All things which Jehovah pleaseth, he doeth in the heavens and on the
   earth, In the sea and in all the deeps.

   7 Causing the clouds to ascend from the end of the earth: The
   lightnings for the rain he maketh, Bringing forth the wind out of his
   secret places.

   8 He smote the first born of Egypt, From man even unto beast.

   9 He sent signs and wonders in the midst of thee, O Egypt! On Pharaoh
   and on all his servants.

   10 He smote great nations, And slew mighty kings.

   11 Sihon, king of the Amorites, And Og the king of Basham, And all the
   kingdoms of Canaan.

   12 And gave their land for an heritage, An heritage to Israel, his
   people.

   13 O Jehovah! thy name is for ever; O Jehovah! thy memorial is from
   generation to generation.

   14 For judge will Jehovah his people, And concerning his servants he
   will repent himself.

   15 The images of the nations are silver and gold, The work of the hands

   17 Ears have they, and they will not hear: Also, there is no breath in

   of a song, And, when we were in suspense, mirth, [Saying] Sing us one
   of the songs of Zion."

   4 How shall we sing the song of Jehovah, In a strange land?

   5 If I shall forget thee, O Jerusalem! Forget let my right hand [its
   cunning.]

   6 Cleave let my tongue to my palate, If I do not remember thee, If I do
   not raise Jerusalem above my highest joy. [400]

   To the Chief Musician. A Psalm of David

   1 O Jehovah! thou hast searched me and known me

   2 Thou hast known my down sitting and my uprising, Thou understandest
   my thought afar off.

   3 My path and my lying down thou besiegest, And with all my ways thou
   art acquainted.

   4 For there is not a word in my tongue [But] lo! O God! thou knowest it
   altogether.

   5 Behind and before thou hast shut me up, And hast laid upon me thy
   hand.

   6 Wonderful is thy knowledge above me; It is high, I cannot attain to
   it.

   7 Whither shall I go from thy Spirit? And whither from thy time shall I
   flee?

   8 If I ascend up into the heavens, there thou art; If I lie down [401]
   in the sepulcher, behold! thou [art there.]

   9 Should I take the wings of the morning, That I may dwell in the
   uttermost parts of the sea,

   10 Even there thy hand shall lead me, And hold me shall thy right hand.

   11 If I should say: "At least the darkness shall cover me; " "And the
   night shall be light for me;"

   12 Even the darkness shall not hide from the And the night as the day
   shall shine, And the darkness as the light.

   13 For thou hast possessed my reins; Thou hast covered me in the womb
   of my mother.

   14 I will celebrate thee; for I have been fearfully and wonderfully
   made: [402] Marvelous are thy works, And my soul shall know them full
   well.

   15 Not hidden is my strength from thee, Which thou hast made in secret:
   I was woven together in the lowest parts of the earth.

   16 My shapelessness see did thine eyes; [403] In thy book all shall be
   written; They were formed in many days, And there was not one of them.

   17 And towards me how precious are thy thoughts, O God! How great are
   the sums of them!

   18 If I should count them; above the sand they shall be multiplied: I
   am awakened, and still I am with thee.

   19 If thou shalt slay, O God! the wicked, Then ye men of bloods depart
   from me.

   20 Who have spoken of thee wickedly: Taken thy name falsely have thy
   adversaries.

   21 Thy haters, O Jehovah! shall not I hate? And with those that rise up
   against thee shall I not strive?

   22 With perfect hatred I have hated them, As my enemies I have held
   them.

   23 Search me, O God! and know my heart: Examine me and know my
   thoughts.

   24 And know whether the way of wickedness be in me, And lead me in the
   way of this life.

   3 Sharpened have they their tongue like a serpent: The poison of an asp

   lips.

   4 Incline not my heart to an evil thing, To commit works of ungodliness
   with the men who work iniquity; And let me not eat of their dainties.

   5 Smite me let the righteous man, [it shall be] a kindness; And let him
   chastise me, [it shall be] an oil that is precious, It shall not break
   my head: For yet also my prayer shall be in their calamities.

   6 Cast down on stony places have been their judges: And they shall hear
   my words, for they are sweet.

   7 As he who breaketh and cutteth on the earth, Scattered have been our

   face I declare.

   3 When perplexed within me was my spirit, And thou knewest my path: In
   the way wherein I walked, they laid a snare for me.

   4 On looking to the right hand, and beholding, None there was who would
   know me, Perish did refuge from me, [There was] no man seeking after my
   soul.

   5 I cried to thee, O Jehovah! I said, Thou art my hope, My portion in
   the land of the living.

   6 Attend to my cry, For under affliction I labor exceedingly: Deliver
   me from my persecutors, For they are too strong for me.

   7 Rescue from prison my soul, That I may celebrate thy name: Crown me
   shall the righteous ones, For thou shalt recompense me.

   PSALM 143

   A Psalm of David

   1 O Jehovah! hear my prayer; Give ear to my supplication; In thy truth
   answer me, in thy righteousness.

   2 And enter not into judgment with thy servant, For there shall not be
   justified in thy sight any living man.

   3 For persecuted hath the enemy my soul; He hath prostrated on the
   earth my life; He hath set me in dark places, as the dead of an age.

   4 And perplexed within me is my spirit Within me astonished is my
   heart.

   5 I remembered the days of old, I meditated on all thy doings; Upon the
   work of thy hands I meditated.

   6 I spread out my hearts to thee; My soul, as the earth without water,
   is to thee. Selah.

   7 Hasten, answer me, O Jehovah! Fail doth my spirit: Hide not thy face
   from me, Because I shall be like to those who descend into the pit.

   8 Cause me to hear in the morning thy mercy, For in thee have I hoped:
   Show me the way in which I may walk, For to thee have I lifted up my
   soul.

   9 Deliver me from my enemies, O Jehovah! With thee have I hidden
   [myself.]

   10 Teach me to do thy will, For thou art my God: Let thy good Spirit
   lead me into the right land.

   11 Because of thy name, O Jehovah I thou wilt quicken me: In thy
   righteousness bring out of trouble my soul.

   12 And in thy mercy thou wilt scatter my enemies, And wilt destroy all
   those who afflict my soul; Because I am thy servant.

   PSALM 144

   Of David

   1 Blessed be Jehovah, my strength, Who teacheth my hands for the fight,
   My fingers for the battle.

   2 My goodness, and my fortress, My citadel, my deliverer for me, My
   shield, and in him I have hoped, Who subdueth my people under me.

   3 O Jehovah! what is man that thou acknowledgest him? The son of man
   that thou thinkest of him?

   4 Man to vanity is like, His days [are] as a shadow that is passing.

   5 O Jehovah! bow thy heavens and descend: Touch the mountains and they
   shall smoke.

   6 Thunder forth thunderings and scatter them; Shoot out thy arrows, and
   destroy them.

   7 Send thy hand from on high; Rescue me and deliver me from waters
   great, From the hand of the sons of the alien.

   8 For their mouth hath spoken falsehood, And their right hand is a
   right hand of deceit.

   9 O God! a song that is new I will sing to thee: Upon the nablum, upon
   the psaltery I will sing psalms to thee

   10 Who givest salvation to kings, Who redeemest David his servant from
   the hurtful sword.

   11 Redeem me, and rescue me, From the hand of the sons of the alien,
   Whose mouth hath spoken falsehood, And their right hand is a right hand
   of deceit.

   12 Because our sons are as plants Which have grown up in their youth;
   Our daughters as corners polished After the similitude of a palace.

   13 Our recesses full, Supplying all kinds of good things. Our sheep
   bringing forth thousands, [Yea] ten thousands in our streets.

   14 Our oxen to the burden accustomed; No breach, nor going out, Nor cry
   in our streets.

   15 Happy the people to whom it is so, To whom Jehovah is their God.

   PSALM 145

   Praise of David

   1 I will exalt thee, my God, my King! And will bless thy name for ever
   and ever.

   2 Every day will I bless thee, And praise thy name for ever and ever.

   3 Great is Jehovah, and to be praised greatly, And his greatness is
   incomprehensible.

   4 Generation to generation shall praise thy works, And thy power they
   shall declare.

   5 Upon the majesty of the glory of thy excellence, And upon the words
   of thy wonders, I will meditate.

   6 And the might of thy terrible works shall they recount; And thy
   greatness I will declare.

   7 The memory of the greatness of thy goodness they shall speak forth;
   And of thy righteousness they shall sing.

   8 Gracious and compassionate is Jehovah, Slow to anger and great in
   clemency.

   9 Good is Jehovah to all, And his compassions are over all his works.

   10 Celebrate thee, O Jehovah! shall all thy works, And thy meek ones
   shall bless thee.

   11 Of the glory of thy kingdom they shall tell, And of thy power they
   shall speak:

   12 To make known to the sons of men his mighty acts, And the glory of
   the beauty of his kingdom.

   13 Thy kingdom is a kingdom of all ages, And thy dominion is throughout
   generations of generations.

   14 Uphold doth Jehovah all the falling, He raiseth up all who are bowed
   down.

   15 The eyes of all in thee do hope, And thou givest them their food in
   its season.

   16 Thou openest thy hand And satisfiest every living creature by thy
   good pleasure.

   17 Righteous is Jehovah in all his ways, And merciful in all his works.

   18 Near is Jehovah to all who call upon him, To all who call upon him
   in truth.

   19 The desire of those who fear him he will perform, And their cry he
   will hear, told he will save then,.

   20 Keep doth Jehovah all who love him, And all the wicked he will
   destroy.

   21 The praise of Jehovah speak shall my mouth: And bless shall all
   flesh his holy name for ever and ever.

   PSALM 146

   Hallelujah

   1 Praise, O my soul! Jehovah.

   2 I will praise Jehovah in my life; I will sing psalms to my God, while
   I have being.

   3 Confide not in princes, Nor in the son of man, in whom there is not
   help.

   4 Go forth shall his breath, He shall return to his earth, In that day
   perish shall his thoughts.

   5 Blessed is he who hath for his help the God of Jacob; Whose hope is
   in Jehovah, his God:

   6 Who made heaven and earth, The sea, and all that is in them: Who
   keepeth truth for ever:

   7 Who doeth judgment for those who are unrighteously oppressed: Who
   giveth bread to the hungry: Jehovah looseth the prisoners;

   8 Jehovah enlighteneth the blind; Jehovah raiseth up those who are
   bowed down; Jehovah loveth the righteous;

   9 Jehovah keepeth the strangers; The orphan and the widow he
   succoureth; And the way of the ungodly he will destroy.

   10 Reign shall Jehovah for ever: Thy God, O Zion, is from generation to
   generation. Hallelujah.

   PSALM 147

   1 Praise ye God; For it is a good thing to sing psalms to our God, For
   it is pleasant, comely is praise.

   2 Build up Jerusalem doth Jehovah, The dispersed of Israel he will
   gather.

   3 He healeth the contrite in heart; He bindeth their sorrows. [404]

   4 He counteth the multitude of the stars: To each of them names doth he
   give.

   5 Great is our Lord, and abundant in power, His understanding is
   infinite.

   6 Raise up the afflicted ones doth Jehovah, He casteth down the ungodly
   ones to the ground.

   7 Sing to Jehovah in praise, Sing psalms to our God upon the harp.

   8 Who covereth the heavens with clouds, Who prepareth for the earth
   rain, Who maketh to spring up grass upon the mountains,

   9 Who giveth to the cattle their food, To the young ones [405] of the
   ravens which cry to him.

   10 Nor in the strength of the horse will he take pleasure, Nor in the
   legs of man will he delight.

   11 Delight doth Jehovah in those who fear him, [In those] who hope in
   his mercy.

   12 Celebrate, O Jerusalem! Jehovah; Praise thy God, O Zion!

   13 For he strengtheneth the bars of thy gates; He blesseth thy children
   in the midst of thee.

   14 Who maketh in thy borders peace; With the fatness of wheat he
   satisfieth thee.

   15 When he sendeth forth his word upon the earth, Very swiftly run doth
   his word.

   16 Who giveth snow white as wool; The hoarfrost as ashes he scattereth.

   17 He casteth forth his ice as morsels: Before his cold who shall
   stand?

   18 He shall send his word: red shall melt them: Blow shall his breath,
   and flow shall the waters.

   19 He announceth his words to Jacob, his statutes and his judgments to
   Israel.

   20 He hath not done so to every nation, And his judgments he hath not
   made known to them. Hallelujah.

   PSALM 148

   Hallelujah

   1 Praise ye Jehovah from the heavens; Praise him in the heights.

   2 Praise him, all ye his angels! Praise him, all ye his armies!

   3 Praise him, ye Sun and Moon! Praise him, all ye shining stars!

   4 Praise him, ye heavens of heavens! And ye waters above the heavens!

   5 Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For he commanded and they were
   created:

   6 And he established them for ever: For ever he hath set for them a
   decree, and it shall not pass beyond.

   7 Praise Jehovah, ye creatures from the earth! Dragons, and all deeps!

   8 Fire and hail, snow and ice! Wind of storm, executing his word!

   9 Mountains, and all hills! The tree bearing fruit, and all cedars!

   10 Wild beasts, and all cattle! Reptile, and winged birds!

   11 Kings of the earth, and all peoples! Princes, and all judges of the
   earth!

   12 Young men, and also maidens! Old men with children!

   13 Let them praise the name of Jehovah; For high is his name alone; His
   praise is above the earth and heavens.

   14 And he hath exalted the horn of his people: Praise is to all his
   merciful ones, To the children of Israel, A people which is near to
   him. Hallelujah.

   PSALM 149

   Hallelujah

   1 Sing ye to Jehovah a song that is new: His praise is in the assembly
   of the merciful ones.

   2 Rejoice let Israel in his Maker; Let the children of Zion exult in
   their king:

   3 Let them praise his name on the pipe: On the timbrel and the harp let
   them sing psalms to him.

   4 For taken pleasure hath Jehovah in his people: He will glorify the
   poor ones unto salvation.

   5 Exult let the merciful ones in glory; Let them shout with joy on
   their couches.

   6 The exaltations of God are in their mouth, And a sword of two edges
   in their hand;

   7 To execute vengeance on the heathen, Chastisements on the nations:

   8 To bind their kings with chains, And their nobles with fetters of
   iron:

   9 To execute upon them the judgment written. This honor is to all his
   merciful ones. Hallelujah.

   3 Praise him with sound of trumpet; Praise him with nablum and harp.

   4 Praise him with timbrel and pipe; Praise him with strings and organ.

   5 Praise him with cymbals of sound; Praise him with cymbals of
   shouting.

   6 Let every thing that breatheth praise God. Hallelujah.
