  Philemon

A.T. Robertson
     __________________________________________________________________

   1:1 A prisoner of Christ Jesus [desmios Christou Iesou]. As verse 9 and
   in Eph 3:1; 4:1. Old adjective from [desmos] (bond, [deO], to bind).
   Apparently used here on purpose rather than [apostolos] as more
   effective with Philemon and a more touching occasion of pride as Paul
   writes with his manacled right hand. Timothy [Timotheos]. With Paul in
   Ephesus (Acts 19:22) and probably known to Philemon. Associated with
   Paul also in I and II Thess., II Cor., Philipp., Col. To
   Philemon[Philemoni]. A resident of Colossae and a convert of Paul's
   (verse 19), perhaps coming to Ephesus while Paul was there when his
   ministry had so much influence over the province of Asia (Acts 19:9 f.,
   26; 1 Corinthians 16:19). The name Philemon occurs in the legend of
   Baucis and Philemon (Ovid's Metamorphoses), but with no connection with
   the brother here. He was active in the church in Colossae ("our
   co-worker," [sunergOi hemOn] and was beloved [agapetOi] by Paul.

   1:2 To Apphia our sister [Apphiai tei adelphei]. Dative case in
   address. A common name in Phrygian inscriptions and apparently the wife
   of Philemon. "Sister" is in the Christian sense. To Archippus
   [ArchippOi]. Dative case in address. It is uncertain whether he is the
   son of Philemon or not. Apparently he is prominent in the church in
   Colossae, possibly even pastor, probably not in Laodicea as some
   understand Col 4:17 to imply. Fellow-soldier [sunstratiOtei]. Old word,
   only here and Phil. 2:25 in N.T. In metaphorical sense. Perhaps while
   Paul was in Ephesus. To the church in thy house [tei kat' oikon sou
   ekklesiai]. The church that met in the house of Philemon. In large
   cities there would be several meeting-places. Before the third century
   there is no certain evidence of special church buildings for worship
   (White, Exp. Grk. T.). See Acts 12:12 for Mary's house in Jerusalem,
   1Co 16:19 for the house of Aquila and Prisca in Ephesus, Ro 16:5 for
   the house of Prisca and Aquila in Rome, Col 4:15 for the house of
   Nympha in Laodicea.

   1:4 Always [pantote]. Goes with [eucharistO] though so far away in the
   Greek sentence. Making mention of thee [mneian sou poioumenos]. See 1Th
   1:2 for this phrase. In [epi]. Upon the occasion of.

   1:5 Hearing [akouOn]. Through Epaphras (Col 1:7, 8; 4:12), possibly
   from Onesimus also. And towards all the saints [kai eis pantas tous
   hagious]. He spoke of "thy love and faith" [sou ten agapen kai ten
   pistin] "towards the Lord Jesus" [pros ton Kurion Iesoun] and by a sort
   of momentum (Vincent) he carries both words over to the saints, though
   it can be explained as chiasm (Ga 4:4) also.

   1:6 That [hopOs]. Rather than the more common final particle [hina].
   Connected with [mneian poioumenos]. The fellowship of thy faith [he
   koinOnia tes pisteOs sou]. Partnership like Php 1:5 in (objective
   genitive, [pisteOs]. Effectual [energes]. Common adjective, like
   [energos] (at work), in N.T. only here, I Cor. 16:9; Heb 4:12. Papyri
   use [energos] of a mill in working order, of ploughed land, etc. In you
   [en humin]. Some MSS. have [en hemin] (in us), itacism and common.

   1:7 I had [eschon]. Ingressive second aorist active indicative of
   [echO], not [eichomen] as the Textus Receptus has it. Paul refers to
   his joy when he first heard the good news about Philemon's activity
   (verse 5). The hearts [ta splagchna]. See Php 1:8 for this use of this
   word for the nobler viscera (heart, lungs, liver) and here for the
   emotional nature. Have been refreshed [anapepautai]. Perfect passive
   indicative of old compound verb [anapauO] as in Mt 11:28, a relief and
   refreshment whether temporary (Mr 6:31) or eternal (Re 14:13).

   1:8 Though I have [echOn]. Concessive participle (present active). That
   which is befitting [to anekon]. Neuter singular accusative of the
   articular participle (present active) of [anekO], to come up to
   requirements and so to be befitting. For idea in [anekO], see Col 3:18;
   Eph 5:4. This idiom is in later writers. I rather beseech [mallon
   parakalO]. Rather than command [epitassO] which he has a perfect right
   to do.

   1:9 Paul the aged [Paulos presbutes]. Paul is called [neanias] (a young
   man) at the stoning of Stephen (Acts 7:58). He was perhaps a bit under
   sixty now. Hippocrates calls a man [presbutes] from 49 to 56 and
   [gerOn] after that. The papyri use [presbutes] for old man as in Lu
   1:18 of Zacharias and in Tit 2:2. But in Eph 6:20 Paul says [presbeuO
   en halusei] (I am an ambassador in a chain). Hence Lightfoot holds that
   here [presbutes] = [presbeutes] because of common confusion by the
   scribes between [u] and [eu]. In the LXX four times the two words are
   used interchangeably. There is some confusion also in the papyri and
   the inscriptions. Undoubtedly ambassador [presbeutes] is possible here
   as in Eph 6:20 [presbeuO] though there is no real reason why Paul
   should not term himself properly "Paul the aged. "

   1:10 For my child [peri tou emou teknou]. Tender and affectionate
   reference to Onesimus as his spiritual child. Whom I have begotten in
   my bonds [hon egennesa en tois desmois]. First aorist active indicative
   of [gennaO], to beget. See I Cor. 4:15 for this figurative sense. Paul
   is evidently proud of winning Onesimus to Christ though a prisoner
   himself.

   1:11 Onesimus [Onesimon]. A common name among slaves and made like
   Chresimus, Chrestus. The word is from [onesis] (profit) and that from
   [oninemi], to profit, to help. Who was aforetime unprofitable to thee
   [ton pote soi achreston]. "The once to thee useless one." Play (pun) on
   the meaning of the name Onesimus [onesimos], useful) as once "useless"
   [achrestos], verbal adjective, [a] privative and [chraomai], to use).
   But now is profitable to thee and to me [nuni de soi kai emoi
   euchreston]. "But now to thee and to me useful." Still further play on
   the name Onesimus by [euchreston] (verbal adjective from [eu] and
   [chraomai], to use). Ethical dative here [soi, emoi].

   1:12 I have sent back [anepempsa]. Epistolary aorist. As it will look
   when Onesimus arrives. In his own person [auton]. "Himself," intensive
   pronoun with [hon] (whom). My very heart [ta ema splagchna]. As in
   verse 7. He almost loves Onesimus as his own son.

   1:13 I would fain have kept [eboulomen katechein]. Imperfect middle and
   present infinitive, "I was wishing to hold back." Again from the
   standpoint of the arrival of Onesimus. In thy behalf [huper sou]. So
   "in thy stead," "in place of thee." He might minister [diakonei].
   Present active subjunctive (retained after [eboulomen] with [hina],
   purpose continued, "that he might keep on ministering. "

   1:14 Without thy mind [chOris tes ses gnOmes]. Judgment, purpose (I
   Cor. 1:10; 7:25). Ablative case with [chOris] (apart from). I would do
   nothing [ouden ethelesa poiesai]. First aorist active indicative of
   [thelO], I decided, I wished, decision reached (cf. [eboulomen] in
   verse 13). Thy goodness [to agathon sou]. Neuter articular adjective
   (thy good deed). As of necessity [hOs kata anagken]. "As if according
   to compulsion." See 2Co 9:7. But of free will [alla kata hekousion].
   According to what is voluntary (Nu 15:3). Perhaps [tropon] (way,
   manner) is to be understood with the adjective [hekousios] (old word,
   here alone in N.T.), from [hekOn] (I Cor. 9:17; Ro 8:20).

   1:15 Perhaps [tacha]. Old adverb, in N.T. only here and Ro 5:7. That
   thou shouldst have him [hina auton apecheis]. Final clause with [hina]
   and present active subjunctive of [apechO], to have back, "that thou
   might keep on having him back." For ever [aiOnion]. "Eternal," here and
   hereafter. Surely a noble thing for Paul to say and a word that would
   touch the best in Philemon.

   1:16 No longer as a servant [ouketi hOs doulon]. "No longer as a
   slave." So it has to be here. So it should be always. Paul sends
   Onesimus, the converted runaway slave, back to his legal master, but
   shows that he expects Philemon the Christian to treat Onesimus as a
   brother in Christ, not as a slave. But more than a servant [all' huper
   doulon]. "But beyond a slave." A brother beloved [adelphon agapeton]. A
   brother in Christ. How much rather to thee [posOi de mallon soi]. "By
   how much more to thee," because of Philemon's legal ownership of this
   now Christian slave. "In the flesh Philemon had the brother for a
   slave; in the Lord he had the slave for a brother" (Meyer).

   1:17 If then thou countest me a partner [ei oun me echeis koinOnon]. As
   I assume that you do, condition of the first class. Receive him as
   myself [proslabou auton hOs eme]. "Take him to thyself (indirect second
   aorist middle of [proslambanO] as in Acts 18:26) as myself." Surpassing
   delicacy and consummate tact. These words sound the death-knell of
   human slavery wherever the spirit of Christ is allowed to have its way.
   It has been a long and hard fight to break the shackles of human
   bondage even in Christian countries and there are still millions of
   slaves in pagan and Mohammedan lands. Paul wrote these words with
   wisdom and courage and sincerity.

   1:18 But if he hath wronged thee at all [ei de ti edikese se].
   Condition of the first class, assumed to be true. Onesimus did wrong
   [edikese], first aorist active indicative of [adikeo], to wrong,
   without justice). He had probably robbed Philemon before he ran away.
   Or oweth [e opheilei]. Delicate way of putting the stealing. Put that
   to mine account [touto emoi elloga]. Present active imperative of
   [ellogaO]. In the Koine verbs in [-eO] often appear in [-aO] like
   [eleeO, eleaO]. So with [ellogeO] as [ellogaO], late verb in
   inscriptions and papyri (Deissmann, Light, etc., p. 84), though in N.T.
   only here and Ro 5:13. It means to set to one's account.

   1:19 Write [egrapsa]. Epistolary aorist. With mine hand [tei emei
   cheiri]. Instrumental case and a note of hand that can be collected.
   See 2Th 3:17; I Cor. 16:21; Col 4:18. I will repay it [egO apotisO].
   Future active indicative of [apotinO] [apotiO] to pay back, to pay off.
   The more usual word was [apodOsO]. This is Paul's promissory note.
   Deissmann (Light, etc., p. 331) notes how many of the papyri are
   concerning debts. That I say not [hina me legO]. Neat idiom as in 2Co
   9:4, delicately reminding Philemon that Paul had led him also to
   Christ. Thou owest to me even thine own self besides [kai seauton moi
   prosopheileis]. Old verb, only here in N.T., Paul using the verb
   [opheilO] of verse 18 with [pros] added. He used every available
   argument to bring Philemon to see the higher ground of brotherhood in
   Christ about Onesimus.

   1:20 Let me have joy of thee [egO sou onaimen]. Second aorist middle
   optative of [oninemi], old verb, only here in N.T. Optative the regular
   construction for a wish about the future. "May I get profit from thee
   in the Lord." Refresh my heart in Christ [anapauson mou ta splagchna en
   ChristOi]. See verse 7 for [anapauson] (first aorist active imperative
   of [anapauO] and [splagchna] (3 times in this letter, 7, 12, 20).

   1:21 Obedience [hupakoei]. "Compliance" seems less harsh to us in the
   light of 9. I write [egrapsa]. Epistolary aorist again. Even beyond
   what I say [kai huper ha legO]. That can only mean that Paul "knows"
   [eidOs], second perfect active participle of [oida] that Philemon will
   set Onesimus free. He prefers that it come as Philemon's idea and wish
   rather than as a command from Paul. Paul has been criticized for not
   denouncing slavery in plain terms. But, when one considers the actual
   conditions in the Roman empire, he is a wise man who can suggest a
   better plan than the one pursued here for the ultimate overthrow of
   slavery.

   1:22 But withal [hama de]. Along with your kindly reception of
   Onesimus. On [hama], see Acts 24:26; 27:40. A lodging [xenian]. Old
   word from [xenos], stranger. In N.T. only here and Acts 28:23. I shall
   be granted unto you [charisthesomai humin]. First future passive of
   [charizomai]. Used either as a favour as here and Acts 3:14 or for
   destruction (Acts 25:11).

   1:23 Epaphras [Epaphras]. The Colossian preacher who apparently started
   the work in Colossae, Hierapolis, and Laodicea, and who had come to
   Rome to enlist Paul's help in the fight against incipient Gnosticism in
   the Lycus Valley. My fellow-prisoner [ho sunaichmalOtos mou]. See on Ro
   16:7 for this word, also in Col 4:10. Used metaphorically like the verb
   [aichmalOtizO] in 2Co 10:5, though some hold that Epaphras became a
   prisoner with Paul in Rome.

   1:24 The other "co-workers" [sunergoi] here (Mark, Aristarchus, Demas,
   Luke) are all named in detail in Col 4:10-14 with kindly words.

   1:25 Grace [he charis]. This great word occurred in the greeting (verse
   3) as it does in the farewell.
