PREFACE
     __________________________________________________________________

   This encyclopedia presents in a condensed and modified form that great
   body of Protestant learning called the Realencyklopädie für
   protestantische Theologie und Kirche, edited by Professor Albert Hauck,
   Ph.D., D.Th., D.Jur., the famous church historian of Germany. The
   German work is the third edition of that religious encyclopedia which
   was originally edited by the late Professor Johann Jakob Herzog and
   bore his name popularly as a convenient short title. The late Professor
   Philip Schaff was requested by his intimate friend Dr. Herzog to adapt
   the encyclopedia to the American public and this he did. To this
   combination of German and American scholarship the publishers gave the
   happy title of The Schaff-Herzog Encyclopædia of Religious Knowledge.
   This name has been familiar to thousands of the religious public on
   both sides of the sea for the past twenty-five years and so has been
   preserved as the title of this publication, with the prefix "New."

   The history of this encyclopedia up to the present is this: In
   December, 1853, there appeared at Gotha the first part of the
   Realencyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche, which was
   the Protestant reply to the challenge of the Roman Catholic scholars
   engaged upon the Kirchenlexikon oder Encyklopädie der katholischen
   Theologie und ihrer Hülfswissenschaften, which had been appearing at
   Freiburg im Breisgau since 1846. The credit for suggesting the latter
   work must be given to Benjamin Herder (1818-88), one of the leading
   publishers of Germany. Its editors were Heinrich Joseph Wetzer
   (1801-53), professor of Oriental philology in the University of
   Freiburg im Breisgau, a layman, and Benedict Welte (1805-85), a priest
   and professor of theology in the University of Tübingen. The
   proposition to do as much for Protestant theology and research was
   mooted by a company of Protestant theologians, and Matthias
   Schneckenburger (1804-18), professor of theology in Bern, had been
   chosen editor of the projected work. But the political troubles of 1848
   prevented the carrying out of the scheme and the death of
   Schneckenburger that year made it necessary to find another leader. At
   this juncture Friedrich August Tholuck (1799-1877), professor of
   theology in Halle, where Johann Jakob Herzog was professor from 1847 to
   1854, was consulted and he named his colleague. It was an ideal choice,
   as Professor Herzog was a competent scholar, a friend of progress in
   theology, moderate in his views, and a persona grata to all parties
   among the Protestants. The publisher of the Protestant encyclopedia was
   Christian Friedrich Adolf Rost (1790-1856), who was carrying on the
   business of Johann Conrad Hinrichs, and under that name.

   Both the Roman Catholic and Protestant religious encyclopedias were
   conspicuous successes and came to be called popularly, by the names of
   their editors, "Wetzer and Welte" and "Herzog" respectively. The former
   was finished in 1856 in twelve volumes, followed by an index volume in
   1860; the latter in 1868 in twenty-two volumes including the index. In
   December, 1877, the Herders entrusted a new edition of "Wetzer and
   Welte" to Joseph Hergenröther (1824-80), at that time a professor of
   theology in Munich. On his elevation to the cardinalate in 1879 he
   transferred his editorial duties to Franz Philipp Kaulen (1827-1907),
   Roman Catholic professor of theology in Bonn, and under him the new
   edition was finished in 1901 in twelve volumes, each one much larger
   than those of the first edition. In September, 1903, the index volume
   appeared. In 1877 the first volume of the second edition of "Herzog"
   appeared, edited by Professor Herzog with the assistance of his
   colleague in the theological faculty in Erlangen, Gustav Leopold Plitt
   (1836-80). On Plitt's death Herzog called in another colleague, Albert
   Hauck (1845-), the professor of church history, who survived him and
   brought the work to its triumphant close in 1888 in eighteen volumes,
   including the index. In the spring of 1896 appeared the first part of
   the third edition of "Herzog" with Hauck, who meanwhile had gone to
   Leipsic as professor of church history, as sole editor. It is upon this
   third edition that the present work is based.

   The idea of translating "Herzog" in a slightly condensed form occurred
   to John Henry Augustus Bomberger (1817-90), a minister of the German
   Reformed Church, and then president of Ursinus College, Collegeville,
   Pa., and in 1856 he brought out in Philadelphia the first volume, whose
   title-page reads thus: The Protestant Theological and Ecclesiastical
   Encyclopedia: Being a Condensed Translation of Herzog's Real
   Encyclopedia. With Additions from Other Sources. By Rev. J. H. A.
   Bomberger, D.D., Assisted by Distinguished Theologians of Various
   Denominations. Vol. I. Philadelphia: Lindsay & Blakiston, 1856. In this
   work he associated with himself twelve persons, all but one ministers.
   In 1860 he issued the second volume. But the Civil War breaking out the
   next year put a stop to so costly an enterprise and it was never
   resumed. The first volume included the article "Concubinage," the
   second "Josiah." It had been issued in numbers, of which the last was
   the twelfth.

   In 1877 Professor Philip Schaff (1819-93) was asked by Dr. Herzog
   himself to undertake an English reproduction of the second edition of
   his encyclopedia, and this work was fairly begun when, in the autumn of
   1880, Clemens Petersen and Samuel Macauley Jackson were engaged to work
   daily on it in Dr. Schaff's study in the Bible House, New York City.
   The next year Dr. Schaff's son, the Rev. David Schley Schaff, now
   professor of church history in the Western Theological Seminary,
   Allegheny, Pa., joined the staff. The original publishers were S. S.
   Scranton & Company, Hartford, Conn., but a change was made before the
   issue of the first volume and the encyclopedia was issued by Funk &
   Wagnalls. The title-page read thus: A Religious Encyclopædia: or
   Dictionary of Biblical, Historical, Doctrinal, and Practical Theology.
   Based on the Real-Encyklopädie of Herzog, Plitt, and Hauck. Edited by
   Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D., Professor in the Union Theological
   Seminary, New York. Associate editors: Rev. Samuel M. Jackson, M. A.,
   and Rev. D. S. Schaff. Volume I. New York: Funk & Wagnalls, Publishers,
   10 and 18 Dey Street. The first volume was issued Wednesday, November
   1, 1882, the second Thursday, March 1, 1883, and the third Tuesday,
   March 4, 1884. Volume I. had pp. xix. 1-847; volume II. pp. xvii.
   848-1714; and volume III. pp. xix. 1715-2631. In November, 1886, a
   revised edition was issued and at the same time the Encyclopedia of
   Living Divines and Christian Workers of All Denominations in Europe and
   America, Being a Supplement to Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia of Religious
   Knowledge. Edited by Rev. Philip Schaff, D.D., LL.D., and Rev. Samuel
   Macauley Jackson, M. A. New York: Funk & Wagnalls, Publishers, 18 and
   20 Astor Place, 1887. In 1891 the third edition of the encyclopedia was
   issued and with it was incorporated the Encyclopedia of Living Divines,
   with an appendix, largely the work of Rev. George William Gilmore,
   bringing the biographical and literary notices down to December, 1890.
   The entire work was repaged sufficiently to make it one of four volumes
   of about equal size, and it is this four-volume edition which is known
   to the public as the Schaff-Herzog Encyclopedia, the volumes being
   respectively of pp. xlviii. 679 and four pages unnumbered; 680-1378;
   1379-2086; iv. 2087-2629, viii. 296. As the German work at its base was
   overtaken by the time "S" had been reached, the "Schaff-Herzog" from
   that letter on was based on the first edition of "Herzog." Therefore
   much of its matter is now very old. Yet it has been a useful work, and
   in 1903 its publishers determined on a new edition based on the third
   edition of "Herzog" which had been appearing since 1896. But inasmuch
   as there was a space of ten years between the beginnings of the two
   works, it has been necessary to bring the matter from the German down
   to date. This end has been accomplished by two courses: first by
   securing from the German contributors to "Herzog" condensations of
   their contributions, in which way matter contributed to the German work
   has in many instances been brought down to date, and second by calling
   on department editors for supplementary matter.

   As appears from what has been said above, this encyclopedia is not
   entirely anew work. It is really an old work reconstructed. Its list of
   titles is largely the same and it follows the same general plan as in
   the old work. The points of identity are: (1) that at its base lies the
   Realencyklopädie für protestantische Theologie and Kirche, once
   associated with the name of Herzog, now with the name of Albert Hauck,
   professor of church history in the University of Leipsic, and the
   author of the authoritative history of the Church in Germany; (2) that
   it gives in condensed form the information in that work, and takes such
   matter directly from the German work in most instances, although
   occasionally while the topic is the same the treatment is independent
   of the German contributor's; (3) that it has much matter contributed by
   the editorial staff and specially secured contributors; (4) that in
   Biblical matters it limits its titles to those of the German base, so
   that it should not be considered as a Bible dictionary, although the
   Biblical department comprehends the principal articles of such a
   dictionary. The points of dissimilarity are these: (1) It contains much
   matter furnished directly by those contributors to the German work who
   have kindly consented to condense their articles and bring them within
   prescribed limits. These limits have often been narrow, but in no other
   way was it possible to utilize the German matter. (2) It contains
   hundreds of sketches of living persons derived in almost every instance
   from matter furnished by themselves. In writing these sketches much
   help has been received, principally in the suggestion of names, from
   the English and American Who's Who and from the German Wer ist's (which
   is a similar work for Germany), and we desire to acknowledge our
   indebtedness with thanks. But comparison between the sketches in this
   book and those given of the same individual in the books referred to
   will reveal many differences and be so many proofs of the extensive
   correspondence carried on to secure the given facts. Every person
   sketched herein, with almost no exception, has been sent a blank for
   biographical data. Some thought to save themselves the trouble of
   filling out the blank by referring to a dictionary of living persons,
   but it has generally turned out that the requirements of this blank
   were not met by the book referred to and it has been necessary to write
   to the subject, and frequently more than once, before the desired
   information could be secured., (3) The matter in proof has been sent to
   persons specially chosen for eminence in their respective departments.
   These departments with the names of those in charge of them are:
   Systematic Theology, Rev. CLARENCE AUGUSTINE BECKWITH, D.D., professor
   of systematic theology, Chicago Theological Seminary; Minor
   Denominations, Rev. HENRY KING CARROLL, LL.D., one of the corresponding
   secretaries of the Board of Foreign Missions of the Methodist Episcopal
   Church, New York City; Liturgies and Religious Orders, in the first
   volume, Rev. JOHN THOMAS CREAGH, D.D., professor of canon law, Catholic
   University of America, Washington, D. C., in subsequent volumes, Very
   Rev. JAMES FRANCIS DRISCOLL, D.D., president of St. Joseph's Seminary,
   Yonkers, N. Y.; the Old Testament, Rev. JAMES FREDERICK MCCURDY, Ph.D.,
   LL.D., professor of Oriental languages, University College, Toronto;
   the New Testament, Rev. HENRY SYLVESTER NASH, D.D., professor of the
   literature and interpretation of the New Testament, Episcopal
   Theological School, Cambridge, Mass.; Church History, Rev. ALBERT HENRY
   NEWMAN, D.D., LL.D., professor of church history, Baylor Theological
   Seminary (Baylor University), Waco, Texas. Besides reading the proofs
   they were requested to make such additions as would not only bring them
   up to date but represent the distinctive results of British and
   American Scholarship. (4) A much more thorough bibliography is
   furnished. The attempt has been made to give sources so that students
   may pursue a subject to its roots; second, to supply the best
   literature in whatever language it occurs; third, to supply references
   in English for those who read only that language. (5) All articles
   based on German originals have been sent in proof to the writers of the
   original German articles when these writers were still living. Some of
   them had furnished the articles and they had merely been translated,
   but in the great majority of cases the German authors had not given
   that cooperation; not a few, however, have kindly read our
   condensations and made corrections and additions. For this cooperation
   thanks are due.

   We here mention with gratitude the permission given by the publisher of
   the Realencyklopädie für protestantische Theologie und Kirche, Mr.
   HEINRICH ROST, the head of the great publishing house of J. C. HINRICHS
   of Leipsic, and by the editor of its third edition, Professor ALBERT
   HAUCK, Ph.D., D.Th., D.Jur., of the University of Leipsic, to use its
   contents in our discretion. Dr. Hauck has done far more than give
   permission. He has manifested a kindly interest in our work, has
   revised the condensations of his articles, and facilitated our efforts
   to secure from his contributors advance articles. This helpfulness is
   much appreciated, and we would fain give it prominent recognition.

   Rev. DAVID SCHLEY SCHAFF, D.D., who holds the chair of church history
   in the Western Theological Seminary, Allegheny, Pa., whose father was
   the founder of this work and who was himself one of its original
   associate editors, felt unable on account of other duties to assume any
   editorial responsibility for the present work, as he had been asked to
   do by the publishers when the new edition was determined on, but he
   entered heartily into the arrangement whereby the sole responsibility
   of general editor should be lodged with his former associate editor,
   and has cooperated by bringing down to date almost all the articles
   which he and his father contributed to the first edition.

   The labor of coordinating the material sent in by the many persons who
   have cooperated to bring out this work has fallen upon the managing
   editor, CHARLES COLEBROOK SHERMAN, who has discharged his difficult
   duties with conscientious fidelity and marked ability. The
   bibliography, which is probably the greatest novelty of this
   encyclopedia and is a feature certain to be greatly appreciated, has
   been prepared by Professor GEORGE WILLIAM GILMORE, late of Bangor
   Theological Seminary, and the author of Hurst's Literature of Theology.
   The work of condensing and translating the articles from the
   contributors to the Realencyklopädie für protestantische Theologie and
   Kirche has been done by BERNHARD PICK, Ph.D., D.D., Lutheran pastor,
   Newark, N. J.; ALEXIS IRÉNÉE DU PONT COLEMAN, M.A. of Oxford
   University, instructor in English in the College of the City of New
   York; ALFRED STOECKIUS, Ph.D., of the Astor Library; WILLIAM PRICE; and
   HUBERT EVANS, Ph.D. of Leipsic. The pronunciations have been supplied
   by FRANK HORACE VIZETELLY, F.S.A., managing editor of the Standard
   Dictionary.

   When the contributors to the Realencyklopädie have chosen not to
   condense their articles themselves, but have preferred that this work
   should be done by the editors of the New Schaff-Herzog, the fact is
   indicated by the use of parentheses enclosing the signature. Editorial
   addition's or changes in the body of signed articles for which the
   contributors should not be held responsible are indicated by brackets.
   A double signature indicates that an article originally prepared by the
   contributor whose name appears first (in parentheses) has been revised
   by the contributor whose name follows. The cross () following the name
   of a contributor indicates that he is dead.

  CONCERNING BIBLIOGRAPHY.

   For purposes of research and definite information the student is
   constantly under the necessity of discovering not only lists of works
   on a given subject, but also initials or full names of authors and
   place and date of publication and often the exact form of the title of
   a book inaccurately or partially known. To furnish this information the
   work which will prove useful beyond all others is the British Museum
   Catalogue, which with its Supplement records the books received down to
   1900; accessions beyond this date are also recorded in supplementary
   issues. Especially valuable to the theological student are the four
   parts devoted to the Bibles and Bible-works in the British Museum,
   though the large number of entries makes it hard to consult these
   parts. Some help is given by the tables of arrangement. A Subject Index
   for 1881-1905, ed. G. K. Fortescue, 4 vols., London, 1902-06, makes
   available a very considerable part of the late literature upon all
   subjects. Next to this, if indeed not equally valuable so far as it is
   finished, is the exhaustive work doing for the French National Library
   and for publications in French what the work just named does for the
   British. This is the Catalogue général . . . de la Bibiliotheque
   Nationale, now in course of publication, Paris, 1897 sqq., of which
   volume xxiv., the last received, carries the list through "Catzius."
   The value of these two publications will be more accurately estimated
   when it is recalled that the two institutions are stated repositories
   for copyrighted books in the two countries respectively. An important
   feature of the first volume of the French catalogue is a helpful
   account of previous catalogues of the French National Library. The
   English work is in folio, the French in octavo. Perhaps the next best
   general work is that of J. C. Brunet, Manuel du libraire, 3 vols.,
   Paris, 1810, superseded by the 5th ed., 6 vols., 1860-65, with
   Supplement, 2 vols., 1878-80. After these two works come in point of
   usefulness what may be called the national catalogues, recording the
   books published in Germany, France, Great Britain, Italy, and America.
   For Germany the work was begun in the Allgemeines Bücher-Lexicon, by W.
   Heinsius, reedited and enlarged by O. A. Schulz, then by F. A.
   Schiller, covering the period 1700-1851 in 11 volumes, Leipsic,
   1812-54, for the earlier period incomplete. This was continued by
   Hinrichs' Bücher-Katalog, covering the years 1851-65 in one volume
   (1875), and from that time to the present by the Fünfjähriger
   Bücher-Katalog. Half-yearly volumes are published which are superseded
   in course by the five-year volumes. These were accompanied by a
   Repertorium up to 1885, which arranged the entries topically. From 1883
   on the Repertorium was superseded by a Schlagwort-Katalog, by Georg and
   L. Ost, Hanover, 1889-1904 (now complete down to 1902), serving as an
   index to the Hinrichs, and arranging the catch-words alphabetically.

   For publications in French there is the Catalogue général de la
   librairie française, covering the period 1840-99, 15 vols., Paris,
   1867-1904, begun by O. Lorenz and continued by D. Jordell, with a Table
   des matieres or index published at irregular intervals, but exceedingly
   full and usable. The Table systématique de la bibliographie de la
   France is an annual list of copyrighted books classified according to
   subjects, published in Paris.

   For British publications the London Catalogue, London, 1846, now very
   hard to obtain, carries the list of books from 1800 to 1846 with Index
   to the same. This was continued by the English Catalogue, now complete
   down to 1905, 7 vols., London, 1864-1905. The three volumes for
   1890-1905 are arranged by authors and subjects in one alphabet. For the
   period 1837-89 there is an Index of Subjects, 4 vols., London, 1858-93.
   A Yearly Catalogue is issued, which, like the French annuals and German
   semiannuals, is superseded by the volume covering a series of years.

   For modern Italian works the authoritative source is the Catalogo
   generale della libreria Italians, 1847-99, compilato dal Prof. Attilio
   Pagliaini, 3 vols., Milan, 1901-05, a work singularly complete for the
   period it covers.

   For American publications the period 1820-71 is inadequately covered by
   the Bibliotheca Americana, by O. A. Roorbach to 1861, and then by J.
   Kelly, a set of books rarely on the market. The American Catalogue
   continues this to the end of 1905 in 6 vols. folio, 2 vols. roy. 8vo,
   New York, 1880-1906. This was begun by F. Leypoldt and is continued by
   the Publishers' Weekly. In this series a Yearly Catalogue is issued,
   superseded like the other annuals by the larger volume. The whole is
   being supplemented by Charles Evans with the American Bibliography, a
   Chronological Dictionary of All . . . Publications . . ., 1689-1820. Of
   this magnificent work, vols. i.-iv. are issued, Chicago, 1903-07,
   bringing the titles down to 1773.

   For earlier books a valuable set of volumes is L. Hain, Repertorium
   bibliographicum, 2 vols. in 4 parts and an Index, Stuttgart, 1826-91,
   giving a list of books printed from the invention of printing to 1500.
   To this W. A. Copinger has added a Supplement in 2 vols., 3 parts,
   London, 1895-1902, and Dietrich Reichling, Appendices, in course of
   preparation and publication, containing corrections and additions,
   Munich, 1905 sqq.

   Valuable as selected and classified lists of general literature,
   including theology, are Sonnenschein's Best Books and Reader's Guide,
   London, 1891-95. The foregoing are all in the field of general
   literature and are not specifically theological.

   Of specifically Theological Bibliographies, giving lists of literature
   in the various departments of the science, the older ones have
   principally a historic value. Some of the best are: J. G. Walch,
   Bibliotheca theologica selecta, 4 vols., Jena, 1757-65, arranged
   topically with an index of authors; G. B. Winer, Handbuch der
   theologischen Litteratur, 3d ed., 3 vols., Leipsic, 1837-42 (gives
   little literature in English); E. A. Zuchold, Bibliotheca theologica, 2
   vols., Göttingen, 1864 (an alphabetical arrangement by authors of books
   in German issued 1830-62); W. Orme, Bibliotheca theologica, London,
   1824 (contains critical notes). One of the older books, often referred
   to for its lists of editions of Scripture, is J. Le Long, Bibliotheca
   sacra, 2 vols., Paris, 1709, enlarged by A. G. Masch, 5 vols., Halle,
   1778-90. T. H. Horne added to his Introduction a rich bibliography of
   the works issued before and in his time (also printed separately),
   London, 1839, which, however, is not found in editions of the
   Introduction later than that of 1846. An excellent work is that by
   James Darling, Cyclopædia Bibliographica; a Library Manual of
   Theological and General Literature, London, 1854, with supplementary
   volume, 1859, particularly useful as giving the contents of series and
   even of volumes. A modern production, noting only works in English, is
   J. F. Hurst, Literature of Theology, New York, 1896, fairly complete up
   to its date, arranged according to the divisions in Theology and in
   convenient smaller rubrics, with very full indexes. Unfortunately, it
   needs supplementing by the literature subsequent to 1895. It is to be
   hoped that the publishers will see their way to add a supplement,
   containing the later literature. For Roman Catholic theology consult D.
   Gla, Systematisch geordnetes Repertorium der katholisch-theologischen
   Litteratur, Paderborn, 1894. W. T. Lowndes, Bibliographer's Manual, 4
   vols., London, 1834, new edition by Henry G. Bohn, 1857-64, while not
   exclusively theological, deals largely with curious theological books
   and is useful for the annotations.

   Among the most useful guides to theological literature are the works on
   Introduction to Theology or on Theological Encyclopedia and
   Methodology, most of which give classified lists of literature.
   Schleiermacher's Kurze Darstellung des theologischen Studiums, Berlin,
   1811, 1830, was followed by K. R. Hagenbach, Encyklopädie and
   Methodologie, Leipsic, 1833, revised by M. Reischle, 1889. This last,
   though not in its latest form, was practically reproduced by G. R.
   Crooks and J. F. Hurst, New York, 1884, rev. ed., 1894, with copious
   lists of literature, English and American, added. Better even than this
   is A. Cave, Introduction to Theology, 2d ed., Edinburgh, 1896, in which
   the lists of literature are especially valuable, though the lapse of a
   decade since the publication makes a new edition desirable. Of very
   high value for its citation of literature, including Continental,
   English, and American, is L. Emery, Introduction à l'étude de la
   théologie protestante, Paris, 1904.

   In the way of Biblical and Theological Dictionaries and Encyclopedias
   the past decade has witnessed great progress. The two great Bible
   Dictionaries, superseding for English readers all others, are A
   Dictionary of the Bible, by J. Hastings and J. A. Selbie, 4 vols. and
   extra volume, Edinburgh and New York, 1898-1904 (comprehensive and
   fully up to date in the Old Testament subjects, but conservative and
   often timid in dealing with the New Testament), and Encyclopædia
   Biblica, by T. K. Cheyne and J. S. Black, 4 vols., London and New York,
   1899-1903 (also comprehensive, much more "advanced" in the Old
   Testament and admitting representation to the "Dutch School" in the New
   Testament parts, but handicapped by the Jerahmeel theory of Prof.
   Cheyne). F. Vigouroux, Dictionnaire de la Bible, Paris, 1891 sqq.,
   still in course of publication, has reached "Palestine" with part
   xxix., and is an excellent specimen of the conservative type of French
   Biblical scholarship.

   In Christian Archeology the work of W. Smith and S. Cheetham,
   Dictionary of Christian Antiquities, 2 vols., London, 1875-80, is still
   valuable, and there is no later work in English to take its place. Of
   high value is F. X. Kraus, Real-Encyklopädie der christlichen
   Alterthümer, 2 vols., Freiburg, 1881-86. The best work, which must
   supersede all others because of its extraordinary completeness and
   fulness, but which has been only recently begun and must take many
   years to complete under its present plan, is F. Cabrol, Dictionnaire
   d'archéiologie chrétienne et de liturgie, Paris, 1903 sqq. (parts
   i.-xii. are out, and bring the reader down to "Baptême"). In a
   different field, and worthy of high praise, is W. Smith and H. Wace,
   Dictionary of Christian Biography, Literature, Sects, and Doctrines, 4
   vols., London 1877-87, representing the best English scholarship of its
   day, and, from the nature of its contents, not easily to be superseded.
   A help to this, particularly in the matter of early Christian writers,
   is W. Smith, Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology, 3
   vols., new edition, London, 1890.

   In the general field of Historical and Doctrinal Theology must be
   mentioned on the Roman Catholic side the Kirchenlexikon of Wetzer and
   Welte, 2d ed., begun by Cardinal Hergenröther, continued by F. Kaulen,
   12 vols. and Register, Freiburg, 1880-1903. This work must be commended
   for its accurate scholarship, its admirable regard for proportion, and
   for the large range of subjects it treats with fairness and with only a
   suspicion of a tendency toward ultramontanism. Briefer is the
   Handlexikon der katholischen Theologie, begun by J. Schäfler (continued
   by J. Sax), 4 vols., Regensburg, 1880-1900. The new Kirchliches
   Handlexikon of M. Buchberger, Munich, 1904-06 (in progress), is not
   particularly valuable. The evangelical side of German scholarship is
   represented by the great work of J. J. Herzog, Realencyklopädie für
   protestantische Theologie and Kirche, 3d ed., revised under A. Hauck,
   Leipsic, 1896 sqq., 18 vols. issued to date. This is the great
   storehouse of German Protestant theology and the basis of the present
   work. The most ambitious work of American scholarship is J. McClintock
   and J. Strong, Cyclopædia of Biblical, Theological, and Ecclesiastical
   Literature, 10 vols., New York, 1867-1881, with two supplementary
   volumes, 1884-86 (claims to have over 50,000 titles; necessarily it is
   now in need of revision). Other works, each having its distinctive
   field, are: W. F. Hook, A Church Dictionary, 8th ed., London, 1859,
   reprinted Philadelphia, 1854; J. Eadie, The Ecclesiastical Cyclopedia,
   ib., 1861; J. H. Blunt, Dictionary of Doctrinal and Historical
   Theology, 2d ed:, ib., 1872; idem, Dictionary of Sects, Heresies, and
   Schools of Thought, ib., 1891 (both of considerable worth, representing
   "High Anglicanism"); W. E. Addis and T. Arnold, A Catholic Dictionary,
   London and New York, 6th ed., 1903; J. Hamburger, Real-Encyklopädie des
   Judenthums, 3 vols., 3d ed., Leipsic, 1891-1901 (deals with both
   Biblical and Talmudic subjects; "by a Jew for Jews"); The Jewish
   Encyclopedia, published under the direction of an editorial board of
   which I. K. Funk was chairman and Isidore Singer managing editor, 12
   vols., New York, 1901-06; F. Lichtenberger, Encyclopédie des sciences
   religieuses, 13 vols., Paris, 1877-82 (for French Protestants). T. P.
   Hugh, Dictionary of Islam, London, 1885, is the only encyclopedic work
   on the subject, but defective and unreliable. In Hymnology there are:
   H. A. Daniel, Thesaurus hymnologicus, i. Latin hymns, ii. Latin
   sequences, iii. Greek hymns, iv.-v. supplement to vols. i.-ii.,
   Leipsic, 1841-55 (a storehouse of material often inaccessible
   elsewhere, but ill digested, inaccurate, and perplexing to consult); E.
   E. Koch, Geschichte des Kirchenliedes and Kirchengesangs der
   christlichen . . . Kirche, 3d ed., partly posthumous, 8 vols. and
   index, 1866-77 (the greatest collection of biographies of hymnists,
   unfortunately not reliable); the one English cyclopedic work in
   hymnology is J. Julian, Dictionary of Hymnology, London and New York,
   1907. A work of immense erudition and alone in its field, which
   comprehends much that is theological, is J. M. Baldwin, Dictionary of
   Philosophy and Psychology, 3 vols., New York, 1901-06 (vol. iii. in 2
   parts is devoted to the bibliography of the subject, duly classified).

   While most of the Biblical Helps are noted under the appropriate titles
   in the text, the following are worthy of special mention here. For the
   Old Testament all the books except Exodus to Deuteronomy were published
   in handy form in the Hebrew by G. Baer and F. Delitzsch, Leipsic,
   1869-95 (the text, though critical, does not concern itself with
   readings from the versions); the best ed. so far of the complete Hebrew
   text is C. D. Ginsburg's Hebrew Bible, 2 vols., London, 1894; the text
   alone was reprinted in 1906 (the Introduction to the Hebrew Bible by
   Ginsburg, London, 1897, is the one indispensable handbook to the text);
   yet a very excellent Biblia Hebraica has been published by R. Kittel
   with the assistance of Professors G. Beer, F. Buhl, G. Dalman, S. R.
   Driver, M. Löhr, W. Nowack, J. W. Rothstein, and V. Ryssel, in 2 parts,
   Leipsic, 1905-06, obtainable also in smaller sections. The new series
   entitled The Sacred Books of the Old Testament, ed. Paul Haupt, now in
   course of publication, Leipsic, London, and Baltimore, 1894 sqq., and
   known generally as the "Rainbow Bible" and less widely as the
   "Polychrome Bible," sets forth the composite origin of the books and
   indicates the separate documents by printing the text on backgrounds of
   different tints (the critical objection to the series is that as each
   book is not directly the result of a consensus of scholarship, the
   effect in each case is the pronouncement of a single scholar and
   consequent indecisiveness in the verdict). The lexicons which are most
   worthy of confidence are: W. Gesenius, Thesaurus philologicus criticus
   linguæ Hebrææ, 3 vols., Leipsic, 1826-53 (indispensable for the
   thorough student); idem, Hebräisches and Aramäisches Handwörterbuch,
   14th ed. by F. Buhl, ib., 1905; and (best for the English student) F.
   Brown, C. A. Briggs, and S. R. Driver, Hebrew and English Lexicon of
   the Old Testament, Oxford and Boston, 1906. Besides the old Concordance
   of J. Fürst, Leipsic, 1848, there is now available S. Mandelkern,
   Veteris Testamenti concordantiæ Hebraice et Chaldaice, ib., 1896, which
   unfortunately is badly done, the errors being very numerous. The best
   grammar is W. Gesenius, Hebräische Grammatik, 27th ed. by Kautzach,
   1902, Eng. transl. of 25th ed. adjusted to the 26th Germ. ed. by G. W.
   Collins, London, 1898, along with which should be used S. R. Driver,
   Treatise on the Use of the Tenses in Hebrew, London, 1892. Related to
   Old Testament study is M. Jastrow, Dictionary of the Targumim, Babli
   and Yerushalmi, and the Midrashic Literature, 2 vols., London and New
   York, 1903. For the Greek of the Old Testament there is sadly needed a
   new lexicon. The only one of moment is J. F. Schleusner, Lexici in
   interpretes Græcos Veteris Testamenti . . ., 2 vols., Leipsic, 1784-86.
   The Concordantiæ Græcæ versionis, by A. Tromm, 2 vols., Amsterdam,
   1718, ought not to be discarded, even by those who possess E. Hatch and
   H. A. Redpath, A Concordance to the Septuagint, Oxford, 1892-1900, 2d
   ed., 2 vols. and supplement, 1906, the omissions in which make still
   necessary recourse to the older work.

   For New Testament texts the student will naturally turn either to the
   Editio octava critica major of Tischendorf, 2 vols., Leipsic, 1869-72,
   with Prolegomena by C. R. Gregory, 3 vols., ib., 1884-94 (containing
   the most complete collection of the variant readings with description
   of the sources from which they are derived); to the edition by B. F.
   Westcott and F. J. A. Hort, 2d ed., Cambridge, 1890; to R. F.
   Weymouth's Resultant Greek Testament, London, 1892; to E. Nestle's
   Novum Testamentum Græce, 3d ed., Stuttgart, 1901; or to O. von
   Gebhardt's ed., combining the readings of Tischendorf, Tregelles, and
   Westcott and Hort, 16th ed., Leipsic, 1900. Of lexicons the best for
   general purposes is J. H. Thayer, Greek-English Lexicon of the New
   Testament, New York, 1895; but notice must be taken of H. Cremer,
   Biblisch-theologisches Wörterbuch, 9th ed., Gotha, 1902, Eng. transl.
   of 2d ed., Edinburgh, 1886, with supplement (a work that aims to bring
   out especially the theological, philosophical, and psychological
   elements of the New Testament vocabulary, and is not a general
   lexicon). A choice is given in concordances between C. H. Bruder,
   Concordantiæ . . . Novi Testamenti, 5th ed., Göttingen, 1900, and W. F.
   Moulton and A. S. Geden, Concordance to the Greek Testament, Edinburgh
   and New York, 1897 (good for Westcott and Hort's text). For the English
   Bible the two concordances of value now are R. Young, Analytical
   Concordance to the Bible, 7th ed., Edinburgh and New York, 1899; and J.
   Strong, Exhaustive Concordance to the Bible, New York, 1896. The best
   grammar of the New Testament is F. Blass, Grammatik des
   neutestamentlichen Griechisch, Göttingen, 1902, Eng. transl. of 2d ed.,
   London, 1905, along with which should be used E. D. Burton, Syntax of
   Moods and Tenses in New Testament Greek, Chicago, 1901 (the best work
   on the subject). Of H. J. Moulton's Grammar of New Testament Greek,
   only vol. i., Prolegomena, is published, Edinburgh, 1906. General
   Semitic and Oriental philology is treated in separate volumes on the
   individual languages in the Porta linguarum orientalium, ed. J. H.
   Petermann, H. L. Strack, and others, Berlin, 1884 sqq.

   As a directory upon the geography of Palestine the following works
   represent the choicest: the latest and the standard bibliography of
   Palestine is R. Röhricht, Chronologisches Verzeichniss der auf die
   Geographie des heiligen Landes bezüglichen Litteratur von 333 bis 1878,
   Berlin, 1890. Earlier but still useful is T. Tobler, Bibliographia
   geographica Palestinæ, Leipsic, 1867. On the topography there is
   nothing in English, perhaps nothing in any other tongue, superior in
   its way to G. A. Smith, Historical Geography of the Holy Land, 7th ed.,
   London, 1897. Alongside this should be put E. Robinson's Biblical
   Researches in Palestine, 3 vols., London and Boston, 1841, and in Germ.
   transl. at Halle the same year, and Later Biblical Researches, 1856 (a
   second ed., including both works in 3 vols., was published, Boston,
   1868, but omits some things in the first edition which are sadly
   missed). In spite of its age this book is still useful. The Palestine
   Text Society of London has since 1887 been engaged in republishing the
   ancient itineraries and descriptions relating to Palestine, thus making
   available to the student material otherwise obtainable only by painful
   research. Special notice is deserved by the monographs published by the
   Palestine Exploration Fund of London, including the massive Memoirs. An
   epoch-making work was W. M. Thomson's The Land and the Book, 3 vols.,
   New York, 1886 (perhaps the most popular book ever written on the
   subject). An old classic, by no means superseded, is H. Reland,
   Palestina ex monumentis illustrata, Utrecht 1714. On the antiquities of
   Israel two works with nearly the same title, Hebräische Archäologie,
   were issued in the same place and year, Freiburg, 1894, the one by I.
   Benzinger, in 1 vol. (new ed., Tübingen, 1907), the other by W. Nowack,
   in 2 vols.

   In the department of Church History the sources available to the
   student are growing exceedingly abundant. For a survey of early
   Christian literature the most detailed work is that of A. Harnack,
   Geschichte der altchristlichen Litteratur bis Eusebius, 2 vols. in 3
   parts, Leipsic, 1893-1904 (a book of reference). A handbook of great
   value is G. Krüger, Geschichte der altchristlichen Litteratur in den
   drei ersten Jahrhunderten, Freiburg, 1895, 2d ed., 1898, Eng. transl.,
   New York,1897 (a model of compression and succinctness, including short
   lives of the writers and good lists of literature). C. T. Cruttwell,
   Literary History of Early Christianity, 2 vols., London, 1893, is also
   a work of merit. A massive work, doing for the Byzantine and later
   writers of the Greek Church what Harnack does for the early period, is
   K. Krumbacher, Byzantinische Litteraturgeschichte, 527-1453, Munich,
   1897. As a guide to the use of medieval literature, and as a help to
   the sources and an indicator of all that is best in those sources in
   modern works, there is no book which can be compared with A. Potthast,
   Bibliotheca historica medii avi, Berlin, 1896, quoted in this work as
   Potthast, Wegweiser. No student of ecclesiastical history can afford to
   be without this most complete guide to the MSS. and the editions of the
   sources of knowledge of the lives of the saints, notables, and writers
   down to 1500 A. D.

   As a source for original investigation in Patristics, as well as in
   medieval theological writings, there is nothing so handy (because of
   its comprehensiveness) as the collection made under the direction of
   the Abbé Migne, Patrologiæ cursus completus, Series Latina, 221 vols.,
   Paris, 1844-64; Series Græca, 162 vols., ib., 1857-66 (a set of works
   rarely on the market, costing about $1,200, but possessed by the
   principal general and theological libraries in the country; the
   drawback is that the text is often not critical and is very badly
   printed). Subsidiary to the use of Migne the following works are often
   quoted: J. A. Fabricius, Bibliotheca Græca, 14 vols., Hamburg, 1705-28,
   new ed., by G. C. Harles, 12 vols., 1790-1811, incomplete (quoted as
   Fabricius-Harles), which is a bibliographical and biographical
   directory to early patristic writings, and contains textual matter of
   great importance; J. S. Assemani, Bibliotheca orientalis
   Clementino-Vaticana, 3 vols., Rome, 1719-28 (a collection of Syriac,
   Arabic, Persian, Turkish, Hebrew, Samaritan, Armenian, Ethiopic,
   Egyptian, and other documents, with critical matter relating to them);
   E. Martène and N. Durand, Veterum scriptorum et monumentorum . . .
   collectio, 9 vols., Paris, 1724-33; A. Gallandi, Bibliotheca veterum
   patrum antiquarumque scriptorum ecclesiasticorum, 14 vols., Venice,
   1765-81 (contains some works otherwise difficult of access. An index of
   contents to Gallandi is to be found in J. G. Dowling, Notitiæ
   scriptorum sanctorum patrum, pp. 192-209, Oxford, 1839). A work of
   great usefulness is R. Ceillier, Histoire générale des auteurs sacrés
   et ecclésiastiques, new ed., 14 vols. in 15 and Table générale des
   matières, 2 vols., Paris, 1858-69. Noteworthy are the excellent and
   handy Corpus scriptorum ecclesiasticorum Latinorum, Vienna, 1867 sqq.,
   appearing in parts and not in regular order (vol. xxxxvii. appeared
   1906), and Patrum apostolicorum opera, ed. O. von Gebhardt, A. Harnack,
   and T. Zahn, 4 vols., Leipsic, 1876-78, the same, 5th ed. minor, 1905;
   and J. B. Lightfoot, Apostolic Fathers, 4 vols., London, 1877-89 (a
   work which will stand as one of the monuments of English scholarship,
   rich in original investigation, and with excursuses of the first rank
   in value and brilliancy). All these are supplemented in the case of new
   discoveries or by new treatment of works already in hand in the Texte
   and Untersuchungen zur Geschichte der altchrisdichen Litteratur, ed. O.
   von Gebhardt and A. Harnack, 1st series, 15 vols., 2d series in
   progress (14 vols. issued), Berlin, 1883 sqq., and by the English Texts
   and Studies, ed. J. A. Robinson, 7 vols., Cambridge, 1891-1906. For the
   English student there are available the Library of the Fathers, ed. E.
   B. Pusey, J. Keble, and J. H. Newman, 40 vols., Oxford, 1839 sqq.; and
   the Ante-Nicene, and Nicene and Post-Nicene Fathers, best and handiest
   in the Am. ed., published as follows: Ante-Nicene Fathers, ed. A.
   Cleveland Coxe, 9 vols. and Index, Buffalo, 1887 (Index volume contains
   a valuable bibliography of patristics); Select Library of the Nicene
   and Post-Nicene Fathers, 1st series, ed. P. Schaff, 14 vols., New York,
   1887-92, 2d series, ed. P. Schaff and H. Wace, 14 vols., New York,
   1890-1900. The first series includes 8 vols. of Augustine's works (by
   far the best collection yet published in English) and 6 of
   Chrysostom's; the 2d series includes the church histories of Eusebius,
   Socrates, Sozomen, and Theodoret, and selected works of Gregory of
   Nyssa, Basil, Jerome, Gennadius, and others. Not to be left out of
   account is the Reliquiæ sacræ of M. J. Routh, 2d ed., 5 vols., Oxford,
   1846-48, a collection of patristic and other fragments still of value
   and constantly employed and referred to.

   Among collections of Sources the first place is easily held by the
   massive Monumenta Germaniæ historica, still in course of publication,
   of which over 60 volumes are already issued in folio and quarto,
   Hanover and Berlin. This series originated in the Gesellschaft für die
   altere deutsche Geschichtskunde in Frankfort, 1819. The work was put
   into the hands of Dr. G. H. Pertz, to whom the great comprehensiveness
   of the series and its consequent value is largely due. Dr. Pertz was
   editor and did much of the work till in 1875 it passed into the hands
   of Prof. G. Waitz, at whose death in 1886 Prof. W. Wattenbach took
   charge, and in 1888 Prof. E. Dümmler. Most of the German experts in the
   branches which the collected documents represent have collaborated.
   There are five sections, Scriptores, Leges, Diplomata, Epistolæ,
   Antiquitates, and many subsections. The documents in this royal series
   concern Christendom at large and not, as the title suggests, the German
   empire alone. There is a volume of Indices by O. Holder-Egger and K.
   Zeumer, Berlin, 1890, covering the volumes issued up to that time, and
   the table of contents is carried five years, farther along in the work
   of Potthast mentioned above.

   Other collections of value to the historical student are: the
   Bibliotheca rerum Germanicarun, ed, P. Jaffé, 6 vols., Berlin, 1864-73;
   M. Bouquet, Rerum Gallicarum et Francicarum scriptores. Recueil des
   historiens des Gaules et de la France, 23 vols., Paris, 1738-1876
   (begun by the Benedictines of St. Maur and continued by the Academy. A
   new ed. was published under L. Delisle, 1869-94. The record is carried
   down to 1328 A. D.); L. A. Muratori, Rerum Italicarium scriptores, 25
   vols. in 28, Milan, 1723-51 (covers the period 500-1500 A. D.; an
   elaborate new ed. under the direction of Giosuè Carducci and Vittorio
   Fiorini is being published by S. Lapi at Città di Castello, 1900 sqq.);
   Corpus scriptorum historiæ Byzantinæ, ed. Niebuhr, Bekker, and others,
   49 vols., Bonn, 1828-78 (not so good in workmanship as is usual with
   German issues; a new ed. is in course of publication in 50 vols. at
   Bonn). In connection with this series of Byzantine historians should be
   noticed E. A. Sophocles, Greek-English Dictionary, Memorial edition,
   New York, 1887 (good for the Greek of the Roman and Byzantine periods).
   Recueil des historiens des croisades, 13 vols., Paris, 1841-85
   (published under the care of the French Academy), is necessary for the
   study of the kingdoms of Jerusalem, Cyprus, and Armenia. The Corpus
   Reformatorum, begun at Halle, 1834, with the works of Melanchthon in 28
   vols.; continued with Calvin's in 59; and now presenting those of
   Zwingli, is the indispensable source for the student of those writers.
   Of some value to the student, more particularly to the archeologist,
   are: Corpus inscriptionum Latinarum, Berlin, 1863 sqq., and Corpus
   inscriptionum Græcarum, Berlin, 1825 sqq. A magnificent series is in
   progress in the Corpus inscriptionum Semiticarum, Paris, 1881 sqq.

   For those who have not access to large libraries a number of selections
   from historical documents have been printed. For church history to the
   time of Constantine, cf. H. M. Gwatkin, Selection from Early Writers,
   London and New York, 1893; for the medieval and modern periods one of
   the best is E. Reich, Select Documents Illustrating Mediæval and Modern
   History, London, 1905, with which may be compared the smaller
   collection by S. Mathews, Select Mediæval Documents, 764.-1254 A.D.,
   Boston, 1892 (both give the selections in the original languages). For
   students of the medieval period O. J. Thatcher and E. H. McNeal have
   translated many important documents in A Source Book for Mediæval
   History, New York, 1905. Other works of this character are E. F.
   Henderson, Select Documents of the Middle Ages, London, 1892; D. C.
   Munro and G. C. Sellery, Medieval Civilization, New York, 1904
   (consists of translations or condensations from European writers on
   important topics); J. H. Robinson, Readings in European History, 2
   vols., Boston, 1904-06 (containing translations, condensations, and
   adaptations of selections, ranging from Seneca to J. A. Hobson, useful
   for illustration of European and American history, sacred and secular).
   The reader of German will receive efficient help in such publications
   as M. Schilling, Quellenbuch zur Geschichte der Neuzeit, 2d ed.,
   Berlin, 1890; K. Noack, Kirchengeschichtliches Lesebuch, 2d ed., Berlin
   1890; D. A. Ludwig, Quellenbuch zur Kirchengeschichte, Davos, 1891; P.
   Mehlhorn, Aus den Quellen der Kirchengeschichte, Berlin, 1894; C.
   Mirbt, Quellen zur Geschichte des Papsttums, 2d ed., Tübingen, 1901; H.
   Rinn and J. Jilngst, Kirchengeschichtliches Lesebuch, Tübingen, 1905.

   To English Ecclesiastical Sources an excellent guide is C. Gross,
   Sources and Literature of English History to 1485, London, 1900. First
   among the collections of sources is to be mentioned A. W. Haddan and W.
   Stubbs, Councils and Ecclesiastical Documents relating to Great Britain
   and Ireland, 3 vols. (vol. ii. in 2 parts), London, 1869-78 (covering
   the period 200-870 A. D. a storehouse of original documents,
   unfortunately left incomplete through the death of Haddan). Of high
   value are David Wilkins, Concilia Magnæ Britanniæ . . . 446-1717, 4
   vols., London, 1737; Monumenta historica Britannica. Materials for the
   History of Britain . . . to the End of the Reign of Henry VII. Notes by
   H. Petrie and J. Sharpe, Introduction by T. D. Hardy, vol. i. folio,
   London, 1848 (no more published; issued under the direction of the
   Record Commission); J. A. Giles, Patres ecclesiæ Anglicani ad annum
   1800, 36 vols., Oxford, 1838-43 (the work not well done, but still
   useful). For the reader of English alone a large number of select
   sources are given in H. Gee and W. J. Hardy, Documents Illustrative of
   English Church History, London, 1896 (covers the period 314-1700).
   Known by the searcher after original sources as of the highest value
   are the publications of a number of societies. Belonging in this class,
   though not under the care of any society, are Rerum Britannicarum medii
   avi scriptores, published under the Direction of the Master of the
   Rolls, London, 1858-91 (known as the Rolls Series. One of the most
   important of this series is No. 26, T. D. Hardy's Descriptive Catalogue
   of Materials Relating to the History of Great Britain and Ireland . . .
   to the End of the Reign of Henry VII., 3 vols. in 4, 1862-71). The
   Henry Bradshaw Society of London began in 1891 to publish monastic and
   other documents; the Camden Society exists for the purpose of
   publishing documents illustrative of English history (London, 1838 to
   date), many of which are of ecclesiastical interest; the Surtees
   Society of Durham, founded 1834, has issued over 100 volumes, many of
   which make available sources of the first rank.

   In the field of Biography a number of works should be known to
   students. A monumental work begun by J. S. Ersch and J. G. Gruber,
   continued by A. Leskien, is Allgemeine Encyklopädie der Wissenschaften
   und Künste in alphabetischer Folge, Leipsic, 1818-89 and still
   receiving additions. Already 100 volumes and more have been issued, and
   it is to be continued from time to time. The biographical interest is
   so pronounced in this production that it takes a front rank in this
   class of works. The biographical interest is also predominant in
   another work to which very frequent reference is made, L. S. Le Nain de
   Tillemont, Mémoires pour servir a l'histoire ecclésiastique des six
   premiers siècles, 2d ed., 16 vols., Paris, 1701-12, parts of it in an
   English translation by T. Deacon, 2 vols., London, 1721,1733-35. J. P.
   Niceron, Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire des hommes illustrés dans la
   republique des lettres, 43 vols., Paris, 1729-45, is a work of
   reference often used; mention is due also to the Biographie
   universelle, ancienne et moderne, 45 vols., Paris, 1843 sqq., and
   Nouvelle biographie universelle of J. C. F. Hoefer, 46 vols., Paris,
   1852-56, both serviceable and sometimes the only available works. Of
   national biographical works, for Germany there is the Allgemeine
   deutsche Biographic, 50 vols., Leipsic, 1875-1905 (still in progress;
   it is under the auspices of the Historical Commission of the Royal
   Bavarian Academy of Sciences); for France, the Histoire littéraire de
   la France begun by the Benedictines of St. Maur, 12 vols., Paris,
   1733-63, and continued by members of the Academy of Inscriptions and
   Belles-lettres to vol., xxxii., 1898 (a new edition is in progress,
   completed as far as vol. xvi.); for Protestant France may be consulted
   E. and E. Haag, La France protestante, 7 vols., Paris, 1846-59, 2d ed.,
   enlarged by H. L. Bordier, vols. i.-vi., 1887-89; also belonging here
   is A. C. A. Agnew, Protestant Exiles from France, 2 vols., Edinburgh,
   1886 (printed for private circulation only). The one work of note for
   Holland is A. J. Van der As, Biographisch Woordenboek van der
   Nederlanden, Haarlem, 1852 sqq. For England there is the noble
   Dictionary of National Biography, edited by Leslie Stephen and Sidney
   Lee, 63 vols., and 3 supplement vols., with one of errata, London and
   New York, 1885-1904 (contains much of interest to Americans, especially
   on the founders and notables of colonial times; a cheaper ed. is
   promised); F. Boase, Modern English Biography of Persons who have died
   since . . . 1850, 3 vols., Truro, 1892-1901; and J. Gillow,
   Bibliographical Dictionary of English Catholics, 1534-1886, 5 vols.,
   London and New York, n.d. (the lists of works by the subjects of the
   entries are an exceedingly valuable feature, being very complete). The
   Danes have also a biographical dictionary like those mentioned, Dansk
   biografisk lexikon, tillige omfallende Norge for tidsrummet, 1537-1814.
   Udgivet af C. F. Briska, Copenhagen, 1887 sqq.

   There is still needed an adequate work on American Biography which
   shall correspond to the English Dictionary of National Biography cited
   above. There are available the National Cyclopedia of American
   Biography, 13 vols., New York, 1892-1906 (the alphabetical order is
   abandoned and no consistent substitute adopted; an elaborate index
   volume appeared in 1906); and Appleton's Cyclopædia of American
   Biography by James Grant Wilson and John Fiske, rev. ed., 6 vols., ib.,
   1898-99 (the revision consists mainly of a supplement).

   As a propædeutic to the study of General Church History an
   indispensable work is E. Schürer, Geschichte des jüdischen Volkes im
   Zeitalter Jesu Christi, 3d ed., 3 vols. and Index, Leipsic, 1898-1901,
   Eng. transl. of 2d ed., 5 vols., New York, 1891. Of works on general
   Church History there is a wide range of choice. A. Neander, History of
   the Christian Religion and Church, 11th Am. ed., 5 vols., Boston, 1872
   (coming down to 1517 A. D.), and Index volume, 1881, is the most
   philosophical work on the subject yet published, superseded in parts by
   the discoveries made since it was written, but as a whole by no means
   obsolete; with this should go J. K. L. Gieseler, whose Ecclesiastical
   History in the German was in 5 vols., Darmstadt, 1824-25, Eng. transl.
   began by S. Davidson and others, 5 vols., Edinburgh, 1848-56, edited
   and translation carried further by H. B. Smith, translation completed
   by Miss Mary A. Robinson, 5 vols., New York, 1857-81 (especially
   valuable for its citation of original documents); and J. H. Kurtz, a
   translation of which from the 9th German edition by J. Macpherson
   appeared in London, 1888-89 (condensed in form and very usable; new ed.
   of the German by N. Bonwetsch and P. Tschackert, 2 vols., Leipsic,
   1906). P. Schaff, History of the Christian. Church, 7 vols., New York,
   1882-92, coming down through the Reformation, but omitting vol. v. on
   the scholastic period, is perhaps the most readable. A very compact
   work is W. Moeller, History of the Christian Church, 3 vols., London,
   1892-1900 (comes down to 1648; the 2d ed. of the German original by H.
   von Schubert, Tübingen, 1902). J. F. Hurst, History of the Christian
   Church, 2 vols., New York, 1897-1900, is also compact; it is
   conservative in treatment of its subject. A. H. Newman, Manual of
   Church History, 2 vols., Philadelphia, 1900-03, is, like Hurst, compact
   but less conservative in tone. The reader in Church History will find
   three works constantly referred to; viz., J. Bingham, Origines
   ecclesiasticæ, or the Antiquities of the Christian Church, 10 vols.,
   London, 1708-22, often reprinted, unfortunately not seldom in
   abbreviated form (recognized by scholars as a work of "profound
   learning and unprejudiced inquiry" and remaining one of the standards
   in this department; best ed. in 8 vols. of his complete works in 10
   vols., by R. Bingham, Jun., Oxford, 1855); A. J. Binterim, Die
   vorzüglichsten Denkwürdigkeiten der christ-katholischen Kirche, 2d ed.,
   7 vols., Mainz, 1837-41 (a treasury of important notes on "things
   worthy of remembrance"); and J. C. W. Augusti, Denkwürdigkeiten aus der
   christlichen Archäologie, 12 vols., Leipsic, 1817-31. Out of the number
   of works on the History of Dogma the one likely to be most useful,
   though by no means the most philosophical, is A. Harnack, Lehrbuch der
   Dogmengeschichte, 3d ed., 3 vols., Freiburg, 1894-97, Eng. transl., 7
   vols., London, 1894-99, and Boston, 1895-1900. A work of the first rank
   frequently referred to for the history of Europe till the fall of
   Constantinople is E. Gibbon, History of the Decline and Fall of the
   Roman Empire, best edition by J. B. Bury, 7 vols., London, 1896-1900
   (Gibbon is said to be the only student who worked over thoroughly the
   Byzantine Histories; formerly regarded as an opponent of Christianity,
   many of his positions are now taken by church historians).

   For the Church History of Germany three works with the same title,
   Kirchengeschichte Deutschlands, are of supereminent worth and are
   generally used as works of reference: A. Hauck, vol. i., 4th ed.,
   Leipsic, 1904, vol. ii., 2d ed., 1900, vol. iii., 3d ed., 1906, vol.
   iv., 2d ed., 1903 (contains rich bibliography); F. W. Rettberg, 2
   vols., Göttingen, 1846-48 (especially good for origins); and J.
   Friedrich, 2 vols., Bamberg, 1867-69 (like Hauck, good in history of
   the dioceses). A handy help to the early sources of German Church
   History is W. Wattenbach, Deutschlands Gesehichtquellen . . . bis zum
   Mittel des. 13. Jahrhunderts, 5th ed., 2 vols., Berlin, 1885, 6th ed.,
   1893-94 (the changes are so great that both editions are frequently
   quoted side by side). A work of genius, learning, and attractiveness,
   but avowedly from a strong Roman Catholic standpoint, is Johannes
   Janssen's History of the German People at the Close of the Middle Ages,
   German original ed. L. Pastor, 14th to 16th ed. completed in 8
   vols.,1903, Eng. transl. by Miss Mary A. Mitchell and Miss Alice M.
   Christie, London, 10 vols. having appeared up to 1907.

   For the Church History of France a bibliography is furnished by A.
   Molinier, Les Sources de l'histoire de France, 2 vols., Paris, 1901-02.
   Besides Bouquet, already mentioned, there are available for early
   sources: F. Guizot, Collection des mémoires relatifs a l'histoire de
   France, 31 vols., Paris, 1823-35; and Gallia christiana, 16 vols., ib.,
   1715-1865. An important work is J. N. Jager, Histoire de l'Eglise
   catholique en France, 20 vols., ib., 1862-78. In English there are: W.
   H. Jervis, The Gallican Church, 2 vols., London, 1872; H. M. Baird,
   Rise of the Huguenots, 2 vols., New York, 1883; idem, The Huguenots and
   Henry of Navarre, 2 vols. ib., 1886-87; idem, The Huguenots and the
   Revocation of the Edict of Nantes, 2 vols., ib., 1895.

   A fair survey of the course of the Church in England is obtained by
   combining W. Bright, Chapters in Early English Church History, Oxford,
   1906, with the series edited by W. R. W. Stephens and W. Hunt, 7 vols.,
   London, 1899-1906, as follows: W. Hunt, The English Church 597-1066
   (1899); W. R. W. Stephens, The English Church 1066-1272 (1901); W. W.
   Capes, The English Church in the 14th and 16th Centuries (1900); J.

   The English Church in the Reigns of Elizabeth and James I. (1904); W.
   H. Hutton, The English Church from the Accession of Charles I. to the
   Death of Anne (1903); J. H. Overton and B. Felton, The Church of
   England 1714-1800 (1906).

   For the Church History of Ireland and Scotland the following are
   valuable: J. Colgan, Acta sanctorum veteris et majoris Scotiæ seu
   Hiberniæ sanctorum insulæ . . . 2 vols., Louvain, 1645-47; H. M.
   Luckock, The Church in Scotland, London, 1893; J. Lanigan, An
   Ecclesiastical History of Ireland . . . to the 18th Century, 2d ed., 4
   vols., Dublin, 1829 (a very important and essential work); J. O'Hanlon,
   Lives of the Irish Saints, 7 vols., Dublin, 1875-1877; J. Healy, Insula
   sanctorum et doctorum, or Ireland's Ancient Schools and Scholars,
   Dublin, 1890; and T. Olden, The Church of Ireland, London, 1892.
   Consult particularly the list of literature under [1]CELTIC CHURCH IN
   BRITAIN AND IRELAND.

   American Church History as a whole is treated in the American Church
   History Series, 13 vols., New York, 1893-97, issued under the auspices
   of the American Society of Church History. The principal denominations
   receive extended treatment by some of their own specialists; for the
   minor denominations the provision made is only that given in vol. i. by
   H. K. Carroll, The Religious Forces of the United States, new ed.,
   1896. It is in respect to the minor sects that most difficulty is
   experienced in obtaining data. Another series of a more popular
   character The Story of the Churches, New York, 1904 sqq.

   For the history of the Papacy an indispensable work is C. Mirbt,
   Quellen zur Geschichte des Papsttums, 2d ed., Tübingen, 1901 (a guide
   to the history, giving citations from original sources and a conspectus
   of the weightiest literature). The only work which covers nearly the
   entire history of the popes is that of A. Bower, History of the Popes
   to 1768, 7 vols., London, 1748-61, with Introduction and Continuation
   by S. H. Cox, 3 vols., Philadelphia, 1847 (the latter is the ed. cited
   in this work; the character of the History is poor, as was that of the
   author). H. H. Milman, History of Latin Christianity, 9 vols., new ed.,
   London, 1883, is excellent and brings the history down to 1455; for its
   period (590-795, 858-891) a worthy work is R. C. Mann, Lives of the
   Popes in the Early Middle Ages, vol. i., 2 parts, London, 1902; vol.
   iii., 1906; of great value is L. Pastor, Geschichte der Päpste seit dem
   Ausgang des Mittelalters, 4 vols., 4th ed., Freiburg, 1901-07, Eng.
   transl., 6 vols., London, 1891-1902 (a most industrious and honest
   work, based on research in the original archives, covers the period
   1305-1534; vols. i., iii., and v. of the English contain
   bibliographies); the period 1378-1527 is covered by M. Creighton's
   History of the Papacy, 6 vols., London, 1897 (an invaluable work); L.
   von Ranke, Römische Päpste, 9th ed., 3 vols., Leipsic, 1889, Eng.
   transl., 3 vols., London, 1896, is indispensable for the period
   1513-1847; the story is concluded by F. Nielsen, Geschichte des
   Papsttums im 19. Jahrhundert, 2d ed., Gotha, 1880, Eng. transl., 2
   vols., New York, 1906. A work which parallels part of those mentioned
   is F. Gregorovius, Geschichte der Stadt Rom, 5-16 Jahrhundert, 8 vols.,
   Stuttgart, 1886-96, 5th ed., 1903 sqq., Eng. transl., from the 4th
   edition, 8 vols., London, 1901-02. The official Catholic record,
   covering the early and middle period, is the Liber pontificalis, best
   ed. of the whole work by L. Duchesne, containing text, introduction,
   and commentary, 2 vols., Paris, 1886-92, though the ed. by Mommsen, in
   MGH, Gestorum pontificum Romanorum vol. i, 1898, is even better so far
   as it goes. The bulls and briefs of the popes are best consulted in
   Bullarium, privilegiorum ac diplomatum Romanorum pontificum collectio
   C. Cocquelines, 14 vols., Rome, 1733-48, supplemented by Bullarium
   Benedicti XIV., 4 vols., ib., 1754-58, and Bullarii Romani continuatio
   (Clement XIII.-Gregory XVI.) by A. Barberi and A. Spetia, 19 vols.,
   ib., 1835-57, the whole reedited by A. Tomassetti, 24 vols., Turin,
   1857-72. Consult also L. Pastor, Acta inedita ad historiam Pontificum
   Romanorum, vol. i., 1376-1464, Freiburg, 1904.

   A number of collections and discussions of the Decrees and Proceedings
   of the Councils has been made. Those most cited are P. Labbe and G.
   Cossart, Sacrosancta concilia, 17 vols. in 18, Paris, 1672; J. Harduin,
   Conciliorum collectio regia maxima, 12 vols., Paris, 1715; J. D. Mansi,
   Sacrorum conciliorum nova et amplissima collectio, 31 vols., Venice,
   1759-1798 (of the older collections the one most cited); C. J. von
   Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, 7 vols., Freiburg, 1855-74 (coming down to
   1433; a 2d ed. was begun by the author and carried on by Cardinal
   Hergenröther to 1536, 9 vols. in all, 1863-90; apparently vol. vii. of
   the 2d ed. never appeared); the Eng. transl. of Hefele by W. R. Clark
   includes only vols. i.-iii. of the German, down to 787 A. D., 5 vols.,
   1883-96. Of all these Hefele is the most accessible and now the
   oftenest cited.

   On the subject of Monasticism all students are most deeply indebted to
   C. F. de T. Montalembert, Les Moines d'occident, 5 vols., Paris,
   1860-67, authorized Eng. transl., 7 vols., London, 1861-79. For the
   history of religious orders the old standard, rich in erudition, is P.
   Helyot, Histoire des ordres monastiques, religieux et militaires et
   des, congrégations séculaires de l'un et de l'autre sexe, 8 vols.,
   Paris, 1714-19; the best modern work is M. Heimbucher, Die Orden und
   Kongregationen der katholischen Kirche, 2 vols., Paderborn, 1896-97, 2d
   and enlarged ed., 3 vols., 1907, utilized from Vol. IV. on; the one
   work in English to be cited, which, however, leaves much to be desired,
   is C. W. Currier, History of Religious Orders, New York, 1896.

   On the history of the separate Orders in the Roman Catholic Church the
   most important are the following: for the Jesuits, A. and A. de Backer,
   Bibliothèque des écrivains de la société de Jésus, 7 vols., Liege,
   1853-61, new ed. by C. Sommervogel, Paris, 1891 sqq.; the Historiæ
   societatis Jesu, by a number of hands, 6 parts in 8 vols., Rome,
   1615-1759 ; J. A. M. Cretineau-Joly, Histoire religieuse, politique et
   littéraire de la compagnie de Jésus, 6 vols., Paris, 1844-46; for the
   Benedictines, J. Mabillon, Acta ordinis sancti Benedictii, 9 vols.,
   Paris, 1668-1702, and his Annales ordinis . . . Benedicti, 6 vols.,
   Paris, 1703-39; for the Carmelites, J. B. de Lezana, Annales sacri
   prophetici et Eliani ordinis . . . de Monte Carmelo, 4 vols., Rome,
   1651-66; for the Dominicans, Monumenta ordinis fratrum prædicatorum, in
   course of publication at Louvain since 1896 (the earlier works, now
   being superseded, are: A. Touron, Histoire des hommes illustres de
   Saint-Dominique, 6 vols., Paris, 1743-49, and T. M. Mamachi, Annales
   ordinis prædicatorum, 5 vols., Rome, 1754); for the Cistercians, A.
   Maurique, Annales cisterciennes, 4 vols., Lyons, 1642-59, and P. le
   Nain, Essai de l'ordre de Citeaux, 9 vols., Paris, 1696-1697; for the
   Franciscans, the Analecta Franciscana, 3 vols., Freiburg, 1885-97, and
   the Annales fratrum minorum, begun by L. Wadding, 8 vols., Lyons, 1625
   sqq., continued by J. de Luca and various hands at Naples and Rome, 26
   vols., and covering the period 1208-1611.

   Somewhat akin to the foregoing is the subject of Hagiology, in which
   two works stand out as preeminent. The one is the Acta sanctorum of J.
   Bolland, the issue of which was begun in 1643, continued till the
   dispersion of the Jesuits compelled suspension of the work from 1794
   (when vol. liii. was issued) till 1845. In all 63 vols. have been
   published, and a new ed. has appeared, Paris, 1863-94 (see [2]ACTA
   MARTYRUM, ACTA SANCTORUM). This is supplemented by the Analecta
   Bollandiana, edited by a number of Jesuits, Paris and Brussels, 1882
   sqq. (still in progress; it includes documents unused or passed by in
   the Acta, newly discovered material, variant accounts, notes on the old
   accounts, and description of manuscripts). The other important work is
   the Acta sanctorum ordinis S. Benedicti of J. Mabillon and T. Ruinart,
   9 vols., Paris, 1668-1701, and Venice, 1733-40. Mention may be made of
   the Acta sanctorum Belgii of J. Ghesquiere and others, 6 vols.,
   Brussels, 1783-94. J. Colgan's work on Scottish and Irish saints is
   noted above (p. xviii.). The plan of arrangement in these compilations
   is that of the Roman calendar, the substance is the lives and legends
   concerning the saints, and the value of the material varies greatly. A
   very large amount of the material is derived from contemporary sources
   and is therefore useful when sifted by the critical processes.

   In the comparatively new and certainly interesting region of the
   Comparison and History of Religions the series of first importance,
   making available to readers of English many of the Bibles and
   Commentaries of the great religions, is that of the Sacred Books of the
   East, under the editorship of F. Max Müller, 48 vols., Oxford,
   1879-1904. A valuable set of historical expositions of the historical
   religions is found in the Darstellungen am dem Gebiete der
   nichtchristlichen Religionsgeschichte, 15 vols., Münster, 1890-1903.
   The Annales du Musée Guimet, Paris, 1880 sqq., combine the features of
   the Sacred Books of the East (translations of native sources) and of
   the Hibbert Lectures (discussions of particular religions). The
   [3]Hibbert Lectures are a number of series, each series amounting to a
   treatise on some individual religion or phase of religion, delivered in
   Great Britain between 1878 and 1902 by specialists of eminence. A
   corresponding series, known as the American Lectures on the [4]History
   of Religion, has been in progress since 1895 and is planned ahead as
   far as 1910. A valuable set is found in the Handbooks on the History of
   Religions edited by M. Jastrow, of which the following have appeared,
   Boston, 1895-1905: E. W. Hopkins, Religion of India, 1895; M. Jastrow,
   Religion of Babylonia and Assyria, 1895; P. D. Chantepie de la
   Saussaye, Religion of the Ancient Teutons, 1896; A. Wiedemann, Religion
   of the Ancient Egyptians, 1897; M. Jastrow, Study of Religion, 1901;
   and G. Steindorff, Religion of the Ancient Egyptians, 1905. The best
   individual work on the whole subject is P. D. Chantepie de la Saussaye,
   Lehrbuch der Religionsgeschichte, 3d ed., 2 vols., Tübingen, 1905 (in
   which the author had the cooperation of numerous scholars). Next to
   this is C. P. Tiele, Inleiding tot de godsdienstwetenschap, 2d ed.,
   Amsterdam, 1900. Other important volumes are E. B. Tylor, Primitive
   Culture, 4th ed:, 2 vols., London, 1903; J. G. Frazer, The Golden
   Bough, 2d ed., 3 vols., ib., 1900; F. B. Jevons, Introduction to the
   History of Religion, ib., 1896 (all dealing with primitive religion).

SYSTEM OF TRANSLITERATION

   The following system of transliteration has been used for Hebrew:
   ' = ' or omitted at the z = z =

   beginning of a word.
   ch = ? p = p
   b = b m = ? ph = ph or p
   v = bh or b y = y ts = ?
   g = g k = k q = ?
   g = gh or g k = kh or k r = r
   d = d l = l s = s
   d = dh or d m = m s = sh
   h = h n = n t = t
   v = w s = s t = th or t

   The vowels are transcribed by a, e, i, o, u, without attempt to
   indicate quantity or quality. Arabic and other Semitic languages are
   transliterated according to the same system as Hebrew. Greek is written
   with Roman characters, the common equivalents being used.
     __________________________________________________________________

KEY TO PRONUNCIATION

   When the pronunciation is self-evident the titles are not respelled;
   when by mere division and accentuation it can be shown sufficiently
   clearly the titles have been divided into syllables, and the accented
   syllables indicated.
   a as in sofa o as in not iu ? ? ?as in duration
   ä?"?"?arm ö?"?"?n oor c = k? ?"?"?cat
   a?"?"?at u?"?"?full ch? ?  ?"?"?church

   O?"?"?no iu?"?"?few j? ? ? ?"?"?jaw
     __________________________________________________________________

   [1] In accented syllables only; in unaccented syllables it approximates
   the sound of e in over.

   Aachen, Synods of
          AACHEN, ??´ken, SYNODS OF: The political importance of the town
          of Aachen (Latin Aquisgranum; French, Aix-la-Chapelle) under
          Charlemagne and his successors made it a favorite meeting-place
          for various assemblies. The first synod of Aachen (or Aix) is
          usually reckoned as having met on Mar. 23, 789, and there is no
          doubt that a gathering took place on that day; but its results
          are known only from two royal decrees, the so called Admonitio
          generalis (MGH, Leg., i., Capitularia regum Francorum, ed. A.
          Boretius, i., 1883, cap. 22), and the instructions for the royal
          representatives (cap. 23). The former repeats a summary of the
          earlier canonical legislation on the duties of the clergy, and
          adds further regulations for the improvement of clerical and
          social life, dealing with diligence in preaching, the education
          of the clergy, the observance of the Lord's Day, just judgment,
          equal weights and measures, hospitality, and the prevention of
          witchcraft and perjury. The other document treats of monastic
          discipline and the regulation of civil society. It is
          questionable if this gathering can be properly called a synod;
          and still less can the name be applied to that of 797 (cap. 27),
          which regulated the condition of the conquered Saxons. On the
          other hand, the assembly of June, 799, in which Alcuin disputed
          with Felix of Urgel (see [6]Adoptionism) may be so called, and
          likewise the three meetings in the years 801 and 802. Their
          deliberations led to a series of decrees (cap. 33-35 and 36-41)
          which throw light on Charlemagne's endeavors to elevate clergy
          and laity. The most important is the great instruction for the
          missi dominici sent out in the spring of 802, dealing with the
          discipline of bishops, clergy, monks, and nuns, the faithful
          performance of their duties by public officials, and the
          establishment of justice throughout the empire. Among the
          results of the autumn synod of 802, cap. 36 and 38, deserve
          special attention; they deal with the duty of intercession for
          the emperor and bishops, the education of the people, tithes,
          divine worship and the sacraments, clerical discipline, and the
          system of ecclesiastical visitations. The next synod (Nov. 809),
          was occupied with the doctrine of the procession of the Holy
          Ghost. In the autumn of 816, or the summer of 817, Louis le
          Débonnaire assembled his first synod at Aachen, when the bishops
          laid down new regulations for the community life, both of canons
          and nuns. In the summer of 817 an assembly of abbots discussed
          the observance of the Benedictine rule. The diets of 819 and 825
          and similar later assemblies can again scarcely be counted as
          synods, though the one held in the sacristy of the cathedral,
          Feb. 6, 835, has a synodical character. It adopted a
          thoroughgoing pronouncement on the life and teaching of bishops
          and inferior clergy, and on the position of the king, his
          family, and his ministers, with a view to regulating the
          confusion which the strife between Louis and his sons had
          caused. It also required of Pépin of Aquitaine that he should

          synod held at Aachen in connection with the question of

          Aachen were held under Henry II, one in the year 1000 in
          connection with the restoration of the bishopric of Merseburg
          (see [8]Willigis); the other, in 1023, when the contest between
          the dioceses of Cologne and Liége for the possession of the
          monastery of Burtscheid was decided in favor of the latter.

   Aaron
          AARON: The brother of Moses. In the Yahwistic sources of the
          Pentateuch he is called "Aaron, the Levite," i.e., the priest.
          He is first mentioned when Yahweh appoints him as spokesman for
          Moses in the mission to Pharaoh (Ex. iv. 10-17, 27-31); and
          consistently he always appears with Moses before the Egyptian
          king. Later Aaron and Hur support Moses during the battle with
          the Amalekites (Ex. xvii. 8-13). When the covenant was made at
          Sinai, Aaron, Nadab, and Abihu, with seventy elders, accompanied
          Moses to the mountain; but Moses alone "went up into the mount
          of God" (Ex. xxiv. 1-2, 9-18; cf. xix. 24). While Moses delayed
          on the mountain Aaron made the golden calf; and later he sought
          to excuse himself by saying that he had acted under compulsion
          of the people, who were impatient at the long absence of their
          leader (Ex. xxxii.). In the narrative of Num. xii., Aaron again
          appears in an unfavorable light. He is said to have died at
          Mosera, in the wilderness, and Eleazar, his son took his place
          as priest (Deut. x. 6). Finally, he is incidentally mentioned in
          Josh. xxiv. 5 and 33. The significant fact in all these notices
          is that the Yahwistic sources recognize Aaron as priest. In the
          Priest code Aaron's genealogy and family are given in detail
          (Ex. vi. 20, 23). He is three years older than Moses (Ex. vii.
          7). He is made Moses's "prophet" before Pharaoh (Ex. vii. 1-2),
          and, accordingly, plays an important part in all transactions at
          the Egyptian court. By means of his rod the miracles are
          performed (Ex. vii., viii.). During the wandering Aaron retains
          his prominent position, although subordinate to Moses. The
          hungry people murmur against both brothers, and, at Moses's
          command, Aaron replies to them, and later preserves a pot of
          manna before Yahweh (Ex. xvi.). The priesthood is instituted at
          Sinai and solemnly conferred upon Aaron, his four sons, and
          their descendants (Ex. xxviii.). Of these four sons, only
          Eleazar and Ithamar remain after the destruction of Nadab and
          Abihu (Lev. x. 1-7). Aaron is not only original ancestor and
          type of the priests as distinguished from the Levites, but also,
          in narrower sense, prototype of the high priest, who was always
          from his family and apparently the first-born son in direct
          line. A few of the laws of P are delivered to Aaron as well as
          Moses (Lev. xi. 1, xiii. 1, xiv. 33, xv. 1; Num. xix. 1). After
          the departure from Sinai, Korah and his followers rebel against
          Moses and Aaron; and Yahweh miraculously vindicates the
          supremacy of the latter (Num. xvi.-xvii.; the narrative is
          amplified by an account of the uprising of Dathan and Abiram and
          a contest between Levites and priests). Aaron dies on Mount Hor,
          and Eleazar becomes priest in his stead (Num. xx. 22-29, xxxiii.
          38-39). Of other Old Testament passages in which Aaron is
          mentioned none is noteworthy except Mic. vi. 4, where he is
          joined with Moses and Miriam.

          (F. Buhl.)

          It is important for the history of the priesthood in Israel to
          notice that in the narratives of J and E (called "Yahwistic"
          above) the priestly function of Aaron is quite subordinate, he
          being mainly represented there as the spokesman and the minister
          of Moses and, along with Hur, as his representative--a "judge"
          of the people (Ex. xxiv. 13, 14). It is in the priestly
          tradition that the idea of Aaron's sacerdotal functions is
          elaborately developed.

   Abaddon
          ABADDON, ?-bad´?n ("Destruction"): In the Old Testament a poetic
          name for the kingdom of the dead, Hades, or Sheol (Job xxvi. 6;
          Prov. xv. 11, where Abaddon is parallel to Sheol). The rabbis
          used the name for the nethermost part of hell. In Rev. ix. 11
          the "angel of the bottomless pit" is called Abaddon, which is
          there explained as the Greek Apollyon ("destroyer"); and he is
          described as king of the locusts which rose at the sounding of
          the fifth trumpet. In like manner, in Rev. vi. 8, Hades is
          personified following after death to conquer the fourth part of
          the earth. In rabbinical writings Abaddon and Death are also
          personified (cf. Job xxviii. 22).

   Abauzit Firmin
          ABAUZIT, ??´´bO´´zî´, FIRMIN: French Reformed scholar; b. of
          Huguenot parentage at Uzès (20 m. w.n.w. of Avignon), Languedoc,
          Nov. 11, 1679; d. at Geneva, Mar. 20,1767. After the revocation
          of the Edict of Nantes (1685) an attempt was made to bring him
          up as a Roman Catholic, but it was frustrated by his mother.
          After some hardships and sufferings, mother and son settled in
          Geneva, where Abauzit was educated and where, with the exception
          of visits to Holland and England in 1698, he spent his long life
          devoted to study and the service of the city library. He was one
          of the most learned men of his time, possessed much versatility,
          and enjoyed the friendship of scholars like Bayle, Jurieu,
          Basnage, and Newton. Nevertheless, he published practically
          nothing; and after his death many of his manuscripts were
          destroyed by his heirs. A volume of OEuvres diverses appeared at
          Geneva in 1770; and a different edition in two volumes at London
          and Amsterdam in 1770-73. They include essays against the
          doctrine of the Trinity as commonly received, upon the Book of
          Daniel, and the Apocalypse. He rendered much service to a
          society for the translation of the New Testament into French
          (published 1726). Many of his theological writings are
          translated in E. Harwood's Miscellanies (London, 1774), with
          memoir; and seven essays are reprinted thence in Sparks's
          Collection of Essays and Tracts in Theology, vol. i. (Boston,
          1823).

          London, 1727. He studied in the French Reformed Church academies
          of Saumur and Sedan, and early showed much talent. On invitation
          of the elector of Brandenburg, he became pastor of the French
          Reformed congregation in Berlin in 1680; after the death of the
          elector (1688), he followed Marshal Schomberg to England; and
          became pastor of the French church in the Savoy, London, in
          1689. In 1699 he was made dean of Killaloe, Ireland. His Traité
          de la vérité de la religion Chrétienne (vols. i. and ii.,
          Rotterdam, 1684; vol. iii., 1689: Eng. transl., 2 vols., London,
          1694), became one of the standard apologetic works in French
          literature. Of his other works, L'Art de se connaître soi-même
          (Rotterdam, 1692), giving an outline of his moral system,
          attracted much attention and was warmly defended by Malebranche.

   Abbess
          ABBESS: The title of the head of many monastic communities of
          women, even in some orders where the head of the monasteries for
          men does not bear the title of abbot. An abbess is commonly
          elected by the community. Cases of appointment by the pope on
          the nomination of the sovereign have occurred less frequently
          than in the case of abbots. By the ruling of the Council of
          Trent, only those are eligible who have been eight years
          professed and reached the age of forty, except, in exceptional
          circumstances, when a dispensation is granted by the pope. An
          absolute majority on a secret ballot is required. The election
          must be confirmed by the bishop (or, in certain cases of
          exemption, by the pope, or the head of the order), before the
          new abbess possesses full jurisdiction. A formal benediction,
          for which there is a form in the Pontificale Romanum, is also
          given by the bishop in many cases. The power thus assigned to
          the abbess is merely that requisite to rule her community, and
          in no sense a spiritual jurisdiction; she can not commute or
          dispense from vows, laws of the Church, or statutes of the
          order. She may inflict light punishments in the spirit of the
          rule; but the more severe ones are reserved to the
          ecclesiastical superior of the convent, who has jurisdiction in
          the forum externum. In general it may be said that the power of
          an abbess has been and is much more restricted than that of an
          abbot. For the peculiarly wide jurisdiction of abbesses over men
          as well as women in the order of Fontévraud (not without
          precedent in the Celtic monastic system), see [13]Fontevraud,
          Order of . See also [14]Abbot; [15]Monasticism.

   Abbey
          ABBEY: A monastic house under the rule of an abbot or an abbess.
          The name is strictly applicable only to the houses of those
          orders in which these titles are borne by the superiors. While
          in the East the free form of a group of scattered cells (known
          as a laura) continued side by side with the common dwelling of a
          cenobite community, the West developed a distinct style of its
          own in monastic architecture. The extant plan of the monastery
          of St. Gall (820) may be taken as typical of the construction of
          Western monasteries in the early Middle Ages. The center of the
          entire group of buildings was occupied by an open rectangular
          space, on the north side of which was the church, while on the
          other three sides ran the cloister or ambulatory, a vaulted
          passage open on the inner side, and serving both as a means of
          communication and as a place for exercise in bad weather.
          Connected with the cloister, on the ground floor, were the
          refectory and kitchen; the chapter-house, in which the reading
          and exposition of the rule and the chapter of faults took place;
          the calefactarium or winter dining-room; and the parleatorium or
          reception-room of outsiders. On the floor above, opening on a
          similar passage which connected with the choir of the church or
          the organ-loft, were the vestiarium, where the clothes were
          kept, the library, the dormitory, the infirmary, the rooms for
          the novices, and the apartments of the abbot, which were
          supposed to be accessible from outside without passing through
          the enclosure into which strangers were not allowed to
          penetrate. The kitchen, which lay within this enclosure, had in
          like manner a connection with the house for the reception of
          pilgrims, and with the various farm-buildings, which usually
          formed a separate quadrangle. The entire group of buildings was
          surrounded by a high, solid wall, which in some cases was
          fortified against the dangers of rude times by towers and strong
          gates. The monks' burying-ground was also within the enclosure.

          This system was preserved, with slight modifications, throughout
          the Middle Ages, the Cistercians adhering to it with especial
          closeness, as may be seen at Clairvaux and Maulbronn. Sometimes
          it was enriched by architectural decoration, as in the
          high-vaulted double refectories of St. Martin at Paris and of
          Maulbronn, or adorned with painting, as the world-famous "Last
          Supper" of Leonardo da Vinci in the refectory of Santa Maria
          delle Grazie at Milan. In houses occupied by female religious
          the extensive farm-buildings were naturally lacking. The
          combination of hermit and community life among the Carthusians
          required a larger space, which was obtained by adding to the
          original quadrangle on the basis of the church a second larger
          one, commonly surrounded also by a cloister, with an open space
          or garden (containing a cemetery) in the center, and with
          individual dwellings for the monks around it. The mendicant
          orders strove for simplicity in building as in other things, and
          were forced by their situation in towns to a more restricted
          plan. The teaching orders added a wing or a separate house for
          their pupils. The Jesuits completely abandoned the traditional
          plan, and built themselves large palatial houses, while modern
          monasteries have little to differentiate them from other large
          institutions. For a more detailed treatment of the structural
          system of abbeys and monastic buildings, consult the exhaustive
          monograph by Venables in the Encyclopædia Britannica, s.v.
          Abbey. See [16]Monasticism.

   Abbo of Fleury
          ABBO OF FLEURY, flu´´ri´: French abbot of the tenth century, one
          of the few men of that time who strove to cultivate learning and
          led the way for the later scholasticism; b. near Orléans; d.
          Nov. 13, 1004. He was brought up in the Benedictine abbey of
          Fleury (25 m. e.s.e. of Orléans); studied at Paris and Reims; in
          985-987 was in England, on invitation of Archbishop Oswald of
          York, and taught in the school of the abbey of Ramsey; was
          chosen abbot of Fleury in 988, and brought the school there to a
          flourishing condition. He upheld the rights of his abbey against
          the Bishop of Orléans, and at the synod of St. Denis (995) took
          the part of the monks against the bishops. He twice represented
          King Robert the Pious as ambassador at Rome, and gained the
          favor of Pope Gregory V. He upheld strict monastic discipline;
          and an attempt to introduce reforms in the monastery of La Réole
          (in Gascony, 30 m. s.e. of Bordeaux), a dependency of Fleury,
          led to a mutiny by the monks in which he was fatally wounded. He
          wrote upon such diverse subjects as dialectics, astronomy, and
          canon law; and his extant letters are of much value for the
          history of the time.

   Abbot
          ABBOT: The head of one of the larger houses in the Benedictine
          and other older Western monastic orders. The term originated in
          the East, where it was frequently used as a title of respect for
          any monk (being derived from the Aramaic abba, "father"); but
          there it was replaced, as the title of the superior of a
          monastery, by archimandrite and other titles. In the Western
          orders founded before the end of the eleventh century the title
          is still in use. According to the present system, abbots are
          divided into secular and regular; the former are secular clerics
          who are incumbents of benefices originally bearing the title of
          abbey but since secularized; the latter are classified according
          as they have authority only over the members of their house, or
          over certain of the faithful, or enjoy a quasi-episcopal
          jurisdiction over a definite territory, or are merely titular
          abbots, their houses having fallen into decay. They are further
          divided according to the term of their office, which may be
          either for life or for three years. A special class known as
          mitered abbots have permission to wear episcopal insignia. The
          election of an abbot is commonly by vote of the professed
          brothers, in most cases only those in holy orders. The candidate
          must be twenty-five years of age, a professed brother of the
          order, and a priest. Actual jurisdiction is not conferred until
          his confirmation either by the bishop or, in the case of exempt
          abbeys, by the superior in the case, frequently the pope. His
          benediction is the next step, which takes place according to the
          office in the Pontificale Romanum, usually at the hands of the
          bishop of the diocese. He has the power to regulate the entire
          inner life of the abbey in accordance with the rule, and to
          require obedience from his subordinates; according to the rule
          of St. Benedict, however, abbots are required not to exercise
          their authority in an arbitrary manner, but to seek the counsel
          of their brethren. In many particulars a quasi-episcopal
          jurisdiction has in course of time been conceded to them. Since
          the eighth century they have been allowed to confer the tonsure
          and minor orders on their subjects, to bless their churches,
          cemeteries, sacred vessels, etc., to take rank as prelates, and,
          if generals exercising quasi-episcopal jurisdiction, to sit and
          vote in general councils.

          The practise of granting abbeys in commendam to deserving
          clerics, or even to laymen, led to the creation of a class of
          merely titular abbots, who had nothing of this character but the
          name and the revenues. This practise, which was the source of
          many abuses, was regulated by the Council of Trent. From it
          sprang the custom in France of Applying the title abbé to any
          prominent clergyman who might, according to the custom of the
          time, lay claim to such an appointment, and then to the secular
          clergy in general. A somewhat analogous custom existed in Italy,
          where many professional men, lawyers, doctors, etc., though
          laymen and even married men, retained some marks of the clerical
          character which had earlier distinguished the majority of
          scholars in their dress and in the title of abbate. In some
          Protestant countries the title of abbot still clung to the heads
          of institutions that had grown out of monasteries suppressed at
          the Reformation. See [17]Monasticism.

   Abbot, Ezra
          ABBOT, EZRA: Unitarian layman; b. at Jackson, Waldo County, Me.,
          Apr. 28, 1819; d. at Cambridge, Mass., Mar. 21, 1884. He was
          fitted for college at Phillips Academy, Exeter, N. H., and was
          graduated at Bowdoin, 1840. He then taught in Maine and, after
          1847, in Cambridge, Mass., also rendering service in the Harvard
          and Boston Athenæum libraries. In 1856 he was appointed
          assistant librarian of Harvard University, in 1871 he was
          university lecturer on the textual criticism of the New
          Testament, and in 1872 he became Bussey professor of New
          Testament criticism and interpretation in the Harvard Divinity
          School. From 1853 he was secretary of the American Oriental
          Society. He was one of the original members of the American New
          Testament Revision Company (1871), and in 1880 he aided in
          organizing the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis. He
          was a scholar of rare talents and attainments. He stood first
          and foremost among the textual critics of the Greek Testament in
          America; and for microscopic accuracy of biblical scholarship he
          had no superior in the world. On account of the extreme
          attention he paid to minute details, the number of his
          independent publications was small, and the results of his
          labors have gone into books of other writers, to which he was
          willing to contribute without regard to reward or adequate
          recognition. His Literature of the Doctrine of a Future Life,
          first published as an appendix to Alger's History of the
          Doctrine of a Future Life (Philadelphia, 1864), and afterward
          separately (New York, 1871), is a model of bibliographical
          accuracy and completeness, embracing more than 5,300 titles. He
          enriched Smith's Bible Dictionary (Am. ed., 1867-70) with
          careful bibliographical lists on the most important topics,
          besides silently correcting innumerable errors in references and
          in typography. His most valuable and independent labors,
          however, were devoted to textual criticism and are in part
          incorporated in Gregory's Prolegomena to the Ed. viii. critica
          major of Tischendorf's Greek Testament; the chapter De versibus
          (pp. 167-182) is by him, and he read the manuscript and proofs
          of the entire work. His services to the American Bible Revision
          Committee were invaluable. The critical papers which he prepared
          on disputed passages were uncommonly thorough, and had no small
          influence in determining the text finally accepted. His defense
          of the Johannean authorship of the fourth Gospel (The Authorship
          of the Fourth Gospel; External Evidences, Boston, 1880;
          reprinted by his successor in the Harvard Divinity School, J. H.
          Thayer, 1888) is an invaluable contribution to the solution of
          that question.

          Of his writings, besides those already adduced, may be
          mentioned: an edition of Orme's Memoir of the Controversy
          respecting the Three Heavenly Witnesses (New York, 1866); work
          upon G. R. Noyes's (posthumous) Translation of the New Testament
          from the Greek Text of Tischendorf (1869); work upon C. F.
          Hudson's Greek and English Concordance of the New Testament
          (1870); The Late Professor Tischendorf, in The Unitarian Review,
          Mar. 1875; On the Reading "an only begotten God," or "God only
          begotten," John i. 18, ib. June 1875; On the Reading "Church of
          God," Acts. xx. 28, in the Bibliotheca Sacra, Apr. 1876 (like
          the preceding, first privately printed for the American Bible
          Revision Committee); Recent Discussions of Romans ix. 5, an
          exhaustive article on the punctuation of this passage in Journal
          of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis, June and
          Dec. 1883. The four articles mentioned last, together with that
          on the fourth Gospel and seventeen others, were published in
          1888, under the editorship of J. H. Thayer.

   Abbot_George
          ABBOT, GEORGE: Archbishop of Canterbury; b. at Guildford (30 m.
          s.w. of London) Oct. 29, 1562; d. at Croydon (10 m. s. of
          London) Aug. 4, 1633. He studied at Balliol College, Oxford
          (B.A., 1582; probationer fellow, 1583; M.A., 1585; B.D., 1593;
          D.D., 1597), took orders in 1585, remained at Oxford as tutor,
          and became known as an able preacher and lecturer with strong
          Puritan sympathies. He was made master of University College
          1597; dean of Winchester 1600; vice-chancellor of the university
          1600, 1603, 1605; bishop of Coventry and Lichfield, 1609; bishop
          of London 1610; archbishop of Canterbury 1611. His learning and
          sincerity can not be questioned; but he was austere, narrow,
          almost a fanatic. His one great idea was to crush "popery," not
          only in England, but in all Europe; and popery to him meant
          every theological system except that of Calvin. To further his
          purposes abroad, he meddled persistently in the foreign policy
          of the State and chose arbitrary, high-handed, and cruel means
          to accomplish his ends at home. His principles allowed him to
          flatter the king, to help him generously in money matters, and
          to serve him in certain political undertakings, such as the
          restoration of episcopacy in Scotland in 1608-10. At other times
          his conscience compelled him to be just, and consequently he
          could not retain the royal favor. A Presbyterian at heart, he
          accepted episcopacy only from a love of order and sense of
          loyalty to constituted authority; and his appointment as
          archbishop was displeasing to the Anglican party, who had wanted
          [18]Launcelot Andrewes. His undiplomatic course incensed his
          opponents, and they pursued him relentlessly and cruelly. In
          1621 he killed a gamekeeper while hunting. It was purely
          accidental, and he was deeply shocked and grieved; nevertheless,
          William Laud (his successor as archbishop and his personal enemy
          for years) and others seized upon the incident to annoy him and
          weaken his influence. Charles I., after his accession, favored
          Laud, who brought about Abbot's sequestration for a year
          (1627-28) because he had refused to sanction a sermon by Dr.
          Robert Sibthorp, vicar of Brackley, indorsing an unlawful
          attempt by the king to raise money, and showing little sympathy
          with Abbot's favorite policy of support to the German
          Protestants. After this his public acts were few. But with all
          his faults and disappointments he was faithful to duty as he
          understood it; and he was generous with money, charitable to the
          poor, and a patron of learning. He was a member of the Oxford
          New Testament Company for the version of 1611; and through him
          [19]Cyril Lucar presented the Codex Alexandrinus to Charles I.
          With other works, he published A Brief Description of the Whole
          World (London, 1599; 5th ed., 1664), a geography prepared for
          his pupils at Oxford, containing an interesting description of
          America; and An Exposition upon the Prophet Jonah (1600), which
          was reprinted in 1845 with a life by Grace Webster.

   Abbot, Robert
          ABBOT, ROBERT: 1. Bishop of Salisbury; elder brother of George
          Abbot, Archbishop of Canterbury; b. at Guildford (30 m. s.w. of
          London) about 1560; d. at Salisbury Mar. 2, 1618. He studied at
          Balliol College, Oxford (fellow, 1581; M.A., 1582; D.D., 1597),
          and held several important livings. In 1609 he became master of
          Balliol; in 1612 regius professor of divinity at Oxford; in 1615
          bishop of Salisbury. He was a learned man, an able preacher, and
          a prolific writer, holding in general the same views as his
          brother, but advocating them with more discretion and tact. His
          works include two treatises in reply to Bellarmine, A Mirror of
          Popish Subtilties (London, 1594), and Antichristi demonstratio
          (1603); and A Defence of the Reformed Catholic of Mr. William
          Perkins (3 parts, 1606-09), which won him royal favor and a
          promise of preferment.

          2. Vicar of Cranbrook, Kent, 1616-43; b. probably, 1588; d.
          about 1657. He studied at Cambridge (college unknown), took the
          degree of M.A. there, and was incorporated at Oxford. Parliament
          having decided against pluralities of ecclesiastical offices, he
          resigned his Cranbrook vicarage in 1643, retaining that of
          Southwick, Hampshire, although much smaller. He was afterward
          rector of St. Austin's, London. He was a strong churchman; and
          engaged in many controversies, particularly with the Brownists,
          to whom he was not always fair. Many of his writings, as his
          Milk for Babes, or a Mother's Catechism for her Children
          (London, 1646), were very popular.

   Abbott, Edward
          ABBOTT, EDWARD: Protestant Episcopalian; b. at Farmington, Me.,
          July 15, 1841. He was educated at the University of the City of
          New York (B.A., 1860) and at Andover Theological Seminary
          (1860-62; did not graduate). In 1862-63 he was an agent of the
          United States Sanitary Commission, and in the latter year was
          ordained to the Congregational ministry. Two years later he
          founded the Stearns Chapel Congregational Church (now the
          Pilgrim Church) at Cambridge, Mass., of which he was pastor four
          years. In 1872-73 he was chaplain of the Massachusetts Senate.
          In 1879 he was ordered deacon in the Protestant Episcopal
          Church, and priested in 1880, his parish being that of St.
          James, Cambridge, which he still holds. He refused the proffered
          missionary bishopric of Japan in 1889. At various times he has
          been a member of the Board of Visitors of Wellesley College,
          trustee of the Society for the Relief of the Widows and Orphans
          of Clergymen of the Protestant Episcopal Church, director and
          president of the Associated Charities of Cambridge, vice-dean
          and dean of the Eastern Convocation of the Diocese of
          Massachusetts, president of the Cambridge Branch of the Indian
          Rights Association, member of the Missionary Council of the
          Protestant Episcopal Church, secretary of the Standing Committee
          of the Diocese of Massachusetts, member of the Provisional
          Committee on Church Work in Mexico, president of the Indian
          Industries League, president of the Cambridge City Mission, and
          has been active in other religious and philanthropic movements.
          His theological position is that of the Broad Church,
          sympathizing neither with the extreme of medievalism nor higher
          criticism. In 1869-78 he was associate editor of the Boston
          Congregationalist, and was joint proprietor and editor of the
          Boston Literary World from 1877 to 1888, again editing it in
          1895-1903. His principal works are The Baby's Things: A Story in
          Verse (New York, 1871); Paragraph History of the United States
          (Boston, 1875); Paragraph History of the American Revolution
          (1876); Revolutionary Times (1876); History of Cambridge (1880);
          Phillips Brooks (Cambridge, 1900); and Meet for the Master's

          Cambridge (B.A., 1861), where he was elected fellow in 1862. He
          was assistant master at King Edward's School, Birmingham, in
          1862-64, and at Clifton College in the following year, while
          from 1865 to 1889 he was headmaster at City of London School. He
          was Hulsean lecturer at Cambridge in 1876 and select preacher at
          Oxford in the succeeding year. His works include Bible Lessons

          teaching. He wrote many story-books which had a wide
          circulation, such as the Young Christian series (4 vols.; new
          edition of the Young Christian, with life, New York, 1882), the
          Rollo Books (14 vols.) and Rollo's Tour in Europe (10 vols.),

   Abbott, Justin Edwards
          ABBOTT, JUSTIN EDWARDS: Presbyterian; b. at Portsmouth, N. H.,
          Dec. 25, 1853. He was educated at Dartmouth College (A.B., 1876)
          and Union Theological Seminary, from which he was graduated in
          1879. He was ordained to the Congregational ministry in the
          following year, and after acting as stated supply at the
          Presbyterian church at Norwood, N. J., in 1881-82, went to India
          under the auspices of the American Board of Commissioners for
          Foreign Missions. Since that time he has been stationed at
          Bombay in the Maratha Mission, and has contributed a number of
          monographs to scientific periodicals on the epigraphy and
          numismatics of India, in addition to preparing religious works
          in Marathi for the use of Hindu converts.

   Abbott, Lyman
          ABBOTT, LYMAN: American Congregationalist; b. at Roxbury, Mass.,
          Dec. 18, 1835. He was educated at New York University (B.A.,
          1853), and after practising law for a time was ordained a
          minister in the Congregational Church in 1860. He was pastor in
          Terre Haute, Ind., from 1860 to 1865, after which he held the
          pastorate of the New England Church, New York City, for four
          years, resigning to devote himself to literary work. In 1888 he
          succeeded Henry Ward Beecher as pastor of Plymouth Church,
          Brooklyn, but resigned in 1898. He was secretary of the American
          Union Commission from 1865 to 1869, and later was a member of
          the New York Child Labor Committee and of the National Child

   Abbreviators
          ABBREVIATORS: Officials of the papal chancery whose duty it is
          to prepare apostolic letters expedited through that office. The
          name is derived from the fact that part of their work consists
          in taking minutes of the petitions addressed to the Holy See and
          of the answers to be returned. Formerly they were divided into
          two classes, di parco maggiore and di parco minore, but the
          latter class has long been abolished. In the College of
          Abbreviators at the present time there are twelve clerics and
          seventeen laymen. Legislation of Feb. 13, 1904, defines their
          duties anew. The office dates from the early part of the
          fourteenth century, and has been filled by many distinguished
          prelates. In 1466 Paul II. abolished it because it had been
          corrupted, but it was restored by Sixtus IV. in 1471. There is
          also an abbreviatore di curia attached to the datary, who
          prepares minutes of papal letters addressed motu proprio to the
          entire Church.

                                                         III. Writings.

          Abelard is a name used as the common designation of Pierre de
          Palais (Petrus Palatinus), the first notable representative of
          the dialectico-critical school of scholasticism founded by
          Anselm of Canterbury, but kept by him within the limits of the
          traditional orthodoxy. The meaning as well as the original form
          of the by-name is uncertain; it has been connected with the
          Latin bajulus, "teacher," and with the French abeille, "bee."
          The ending "-ard" is Frankish, and the entire name may be.

I. Life:

  1. Student Life and Lecturer on Philosophy.

          Abelard was born at Palais (Le Pallet), a village of Brittany,
          about 12 m. e. of Nantes, in 1079; d. in the Priory of St.
          Marcel, near Chalon-sur-Saône (36 m. n. of Mâcon), Apr. 21,
          1142. He voluntarily renounced his rights as first-born son of
          the knight Berengar, lord of the village, and chose a life of
          study. His first teacher was Roscelin, the Nominalist, at
          Locmenach, Brittany, now Locmine, 80 m. s. w. of Brest. Then he
          wandered from one teacher to another until he came to Paris,
          where William of Champeaux, the Realist, was head of the
          cathedral school and attracting great crowds. Young as he was,
          Abelard was bold enough to set himself up as William's rival; he
          lectured, first at Melun (27 m. s.s.e. of Paris), then at
          Corbeil (7 miles nearer Paris), and, after a few years, in Paris
          itself at the cathedral school. His success was sufficient to
          make William jealous, and he compelled Abelard to leave the
          city. About 1113 he betook himself to Anselm of Laon at Laon (86
          m. n.e. of Paris) to study theology, having hitherto occupied
          himself wholly with dialectics. His stay at Laon was short and
          was followed by a few years at Paris, where crowds flocked to
          hear his lectures and brought him a considerable income.

  2. Heloise.

          This brilliant career was suddenly checked by the episode of
          Heloise, a young girl of eighteen, said to have been the natural
          daughter of a canon of Paris, living with her uncle, Canon
          Fulbert of Paris. Her education was confided to Abelard, and a
          passionate love sprang up between them. When Fulbert attempted
          to separate them, they fled toward Brittany, to the home of
          Abelard's sister, Dionysia, where Heloise bore a son,
          Astralabius. To satisfy Fulbert the lovers were married, Abelard
          asking that the marriage be kept secret out of regard for his
          ecclesiastical career. Fulbert disregarded this request and also
          treated his niece badly when she returned to his house. Abelard
          accordingly removed her to the Benedictine nunnery of Argenteuil
          (11 m. n.e. of Versailles), where she had been brought up, and
          where later she took the veil, a step which Fulbert interpreted
          as an attempt by her husband to get rid of her. In revenge he
          had Abelard attacked by night in his lodgings in Paris and
          mutilated, with the view probably of rendering him incapable of
          ever holding any ecclesiastical office. Abelard retired to the
          Benedictine abbey of St. Denis in Paris (probably about 1118),
          where he became a monk and lived undisturbed for a year or two,
          giving instruction in a secluded place (the "cella").

  3. Monk and Abbot.

          He received much sympathy and had many pupils. In 1121 a synod
          at Soissons pronounced heretical certain opinions expressed by
          him in a book on the Trinity (De unitate et trinitate divina;
          discovered by R. Stolzle and published, Freiburg, 1891). He was
          required to burn the book, and to retire to the monastery of St.
          Medard, near Soissons. In a short time, however, he was allowed
          to return to St. Denis, but was ill received there; and his
          assertion that the patron saint of the monastery and of France
          was not the same as Dionysius the Areopagite (see [20]Denis,
          Saint) made more trouble with the abbot, the monks, and the
          court. He fled, but was compelled to return and recant his
          opinion concerning St. Denis. Afterward he was allowed to retire
          to Champagne, near Nogent-sur-Seine (60 m. s.e. of Paris) where
          he built an oratory to the Trinity. Pupils again gathered about
          him and the original building of reeds and sedges was replaced
          by one which he called the Paraclete. But he was still under the
          jurisdiction of the abbot of St. Denis and suffered much
          annoyance. He accepted the election as abbot of the monastery of
          St. Gildas in Brittany (on the peninsula of Ruis, 10 m. s. of
          Vannes), and stayed there ten years, but he found it impossible
          to control the unruly monks and they tried to poison him. He
          found refuge from time to time at the Paraclete, which he had
          presented to Heloise after the nunnery of Argenteuil was closed
          (c. 1127); but his visits as spiritual director of the nuns who
          gathered about his wife caused scandal, and he had to give them
          up. Another attempt was made on his life; and once more he
          sought safety in flight, whither is not known.

  4. Second Condemnation for Heresy.

          For several years his life is obscure; it is only known that in
          1136 John of Salisbury heard him lecture in the school on the
          hill of St. Genevieve in Paris, and that during this period he
          wrote his autobiography, the Historia calamitatum. In 1141 a
          council, instigated mainly by [21]Bernard of Clairvaux, a man
          thoroughly antipathetic to Abelard, who had long considered his
          teaching wrong and his influence dangerous, met at Sens (61 m.
          s.s.e. of Paris). Certain extracts from Abelard's writings were
          pronounced erroneous and heretical (June 4, 1141). Abelard
          declined to defend himself; he appealed to the pope, and with
          his followers left the council. His former pupil, Cardinal Guido
          de Castello (afterward Pope Celestine II.), took his part at
          Rome; but Bernard wrote a letter denouncing Arnold of Brescia,
          another pupil, as one of the champions of Abelard, and thereby
          influenced the decision of Pope Innocent II., who condemned
          Abelard to silence, excommunicated his followers, ordered him
          and Arnold to retire to a monastery, and their books to be
          burned (July 16, 1141). Abelard wrote an apology defending
          himself against the action of the council, and sent a letter to
          Heloise maintaining his orthodoxy. He wrote a second apology
          submitting to the Church, and made peace with Bernard.

  5. Last Days.

          By the friendly intervention of Peter the Venerable, Abbot of
          Cluny, permission was given him to spend the rest of his days at
          Cluny. He continued his studies, "read constantly, prayed often,
          gladly kept silence." But, broken by his sufferings and
          misfortunes, he did not live long there. With a view to his
          physical betterment Peter sent him to the neighboring priory of
          St. Marcel, at Chalons and there he died. His body was taken to
          the Paraclete; and on the death of Heloise (May 16, 1164) her
          body was placed in the same coffin. In 1817 their remains were
          removed to the cemetery of Pere Lachaise, Paris, and a monument
          was erected of stone from the ruins of the Paraclete.

II. System:

  1. Philosophy.

          Abelard belonged to the school of Anselm of Canterbury, but he
          did not follow him slavishly; and he was more critic than
          apologist of any system. He borrowed much from Augustine,
          Jerome, and older Church Fathers, as well as from Agobard,
          Claudius of Turin, Erigena, and Fredegis. His originality is
          seen in his doctrine of the Trinity and the Atonement and, as a
          philosopher, particularly in his teaching concerning the
          principia and his position toward the question of universalia.
          The latter is not quite clear; but it appears that he was
          neither nominalist, realist, nor conceptualist. William of
          Champeaux, the extreme realist, declared the universalia to be
          the very essence of all existence, and individuality only the
          product of incidental circumstances. To this Abelard objected
          that it led to pantheism; and he pursued his criticism so keenly
          that he forced William to modify his system. He rejected
          nominalism also, according to which the universalia are mere
          names, declaring that our conceptions must correspond to things
          which occasion them. This view is not conceptualism in so far as
          it does not in one-sided fashion emphasize the assertion that
          the general ideas are mere conceptus mentis, mere subjective
          ideas.

  2. Theology.

          As theologian Abelard is noteworthy for his doctrine of
          revelation, his attitude toward belief on authority, and his
          conception of the relation between faith and knowledge.
          Concerning revelation he emphasizes the inner influence on the
          human spirit rather than its external manifestation, and does
          not limit inspiration to the writers of the Scriptures, but
          holds that it was imparted also to the Greek and Roman
          philosophers and to the Indian Brahmans. He teaches that the
          Scriptures are the result of the cooperation of the Spirit of
          God with the human writers, recognizes degrees of inspiration,
          and admits that prophets and apostles may make mistakes. He does
          not hesitate to disclose the contradictions in tradition, and
          distinguishes like a good Protestant between the authority of
          the Scriptures and that of the Fathers. Faith means to him a
          belief in things not susceptible to sense which can be grounded
          on rational demonstration or satisfactory authority. He opposes
          the compulsion of authority, will have free discussion of
          religious things, and everywhere follows his own conviction; but
          he sets narrow limits to what can be known. An adequate
          knowledge of the unity and trinity of God he declares
          impossible, as well as a scientific proof that shall compel
          belief in the existence of God and immortality. Here he asserts
          merely a possibility of belief. He condemns the acceptance of
          formulas of belief without knowing what they mean, and will have
          no one required to believe anything contrary to reason; he found
          nothing of the kind himself in the Scriptures or the teaching of
          the Church, and does not mean to exclude the supernatural. The
          doctrine of the Trinity he always treats in connection with the
          divine attributes; and in spite of all precautions the Trinity
          always becomes in his thought one of the attributes. He
          qualifies omnipotence by teaching that God does everything which
          he can, and therefore he could not do more than he has done. He
          can not prevent evil, but is able only to permit it and to turn
          it to good. As for his ethics, he teaches that moral good and
          ill inhere not in the act but in the motive. The evil propensity
          is not sin; it is the poena merely, and not the culpa, which has
          passed from Adam upon all. His theory of the Atonement is moral.
          The aim of the incarnation and sufferings of Christ was to move
          men to love by this highest revelation of the divine love. The
          love thus awakened frees from the bondage of sin, enables to
          fulfil the law, and impels to do the will of God, no longer in
          fear, but in the freedom of the sons of God. By law he
          understands the natural law which Christ taught and fulfilled,
          giving thereby the highest example. By his love, faithful to
          death, Christ has won merit with God; and because of this merit
          God forgives those who enter into communion with Christ and
          enables them to fulfil the law. It is in personal communion with
          Christ, therefore, that the real Atonement consists. Only such
          as let themselves be impressed with the love of Christ enter
          into this communion. By the curse of the law from which Christ
          frees, Abelard understands the Mosaic religion with its hard
          punishments. Inasmuch as Christ made an end of the Mosaic
          religion, he abolished its punishments also.

III. Writings:

          A practically complete edition of the works of Abelard
          (including certain writings which are spurious or of doubtful
          origin) was furnished by Victor Cousin in the Ouvrages inédits
          d'Abélard (Paris, 1836) and Petri Abelardi opera nunc primum in
          unum collecta (2 vols., 1849-59); the Opera, from the edition of
          A. Duchesne and F. Amboise (Paris, 1616), with Opuscula
          published later, are in MPL, clxxviii. (lacks the Sic et non,
          that brilliant piece of skeptical writing). Particular works
          have been published as follows: the Theologia Christiana and the
          Hexameron, ed. Martène and Durand, in the Thesaurus novus
          anecdotorum, v. (Paris, 1717); the Ethica (Scito te ipsum), ed.

   Abelites
          ABELITES, ê´bel-??its (ABELIANS, ABELONIANS): A sect mentioned
          by Augustine (Haer., lxxxvii.; cf. Prædestinatus, i. 87) as
          formerly living in the neighborhood of Hippo, but already
          extinct when he wrote. Their name was derived from Abel, the son
          of Adam. Each man took a wife, but refrained from conjugal
          relations, and each pair adopted a boy and a girl who inherited
          the property of their foster-parents on condition of living
          together in like manner in mature life. They were probably the
          remnant of a Gnostic sect, tinged perhaps by Manichean
          influences. [The name grew out of a wide-spread belief that Abel
          though married had lived a life of continence.]

          ABELLI, ?-bel´li, LOUIS: French Roman Catholic; b. 1603; d. at
          Paris Oct. 4, 1691. He was made bishop of Rhodez, southern
          France, in 1664, but resigned three years later and retired to
          the monastery of St. Lazare in Paris. He was a vehement opponent
          of Jansenism. His numerous works include: Medulla theologica (2
          vols., Paris, 1651), a treatise on dogmatics; La Tradition de
          l'Église touchant la dévotion envers la Sainte Vierge (1652);
          Vie de St. Vincent de Paul (1664); De l'obéissance et soumission
          due au Pape (ed. Cheruel, 1870); and two volumes of meditations,
          La Couronne de l'année chrétienne (1657).

   Aben Ezra
          ABEN EZRA (Abraham ben Meir ibn Ezra): Jewish poet, grammarian,
          and commentator; b. in Toledo, Spain, 1092; d. Jan. 23, 1167. He
          left Toledo about 1138 and is known to have visited Bagdad, Rome
          (1140), Mantua and Lucca (1145), Dreux (45 m. w.s.w. of Paris;
          1155-57), and London (1158); in 1166 he was in southern France.
          His poems show a mastery of the metrical art but have no
          inspiration, his grammatical works are not logically arranged,
          and his commentaries lack religious feeling. His exegetical
          principle was to follow the grammatical sense rather than the
          allegorical method of the Church; yet he resorts to figurative
          interpretation when the literal meaning is repugnant to reason.
          His critical insight is shown by hints that the Pentateuch and
          Isaiah contain interpolations (cf. H. Holzinger, Einleitung in
          den Hexateuch, Freiburg, 1893, pp. 28 sqq.; J. Fürst, Der Kanon
          des Alten Testaments, Leipsic, 1868, p. 16), though he lacked
          the courage to say so openly. His chief importance is that he
          made the grammatical and religio-philosophical works of the
          Spanish Jews, written in Arabic, known outside of Spain. His
          commentaries (on the Pentateuch, Isaiah, the Minor Prophets,
          Job, Psalms, the five Megilloth, and Daniel) are usually found
          in rabbinic Bibles. His introduction to the Pentateuch has been
          edited by W. Bacher (Vienna, 1876); the commentary on Isaiah,
          with Eng. trans. and two volumes of Essays on the Writings of
          Abraham ibn Ezra, by M. Friedländer (4 vols., London, 1873-77).
          His poems have been published by D. Rosin (4 parts, Breslau,
          1885-91) and J. Egers (Berlin, 1886).

          ABERCROMBIE, ab´er-crum-bi, JOHN: Scotch physician and writer on
          metaphysics; b. at Aberdeen Oct. 10, 1780; d. at Edinburgh Nov.
          14, 1844. He studied medicine at Edinburgh and London, and
          settled in the former city as practising physician in 1804. He
          became one of the foremost medical men of Scotland, but is best
          known as the author of Inquiries concerning the Intellectual
          Powers and the Investigation of Truth (Edinburgh, 1830) and The
          Philosophy of the Moral Feelings (London, 1833), works which he
          wrote from a belief that his knowledge of nervous diseases
          fitted him to discuss mental phenomena. The books long enjoyed
          great popularity, but were not written in the real spirit of a
          truth-seeker, have little originality, and are now superseded. A
          volume of Essays and Tracts, mainly on religious subjects, was
          published posthumously (Edinburgh, 1847).

   Abernethy John
          ABERNETHY, ab´er-neth-i, JOHN: Irish Presbyterian; b. at Brigh,
          County Tyrone, Oct.19, 1680; d. at Dublin Dec., 1740. He studied
          at Glasgow (M.A.) and Edinburgh, and became minister of the
          Presbyterian congregation at Antrim in 1703. In 1717, following
          his own judgment and desire, he chose to remain at Antrim,
          although the synod wished him to accept a call from a Dublin
          congregation. To disregard an appointment of the synod was an
          unheard-of act for the time, and the Irish Church was split into
          two parties, the "Subscribers" and "Non-Subscribers," Abernethy
          being at the head of the latter. The Non-Subscribers were cut
          off from the Church in 1726. From 1730 till his death he was
          minister of the Wood Street Church, Dublin. Here he again showed
          himself in advance of his time by opposing the Test Act and "all
          laws that, upon account of mere differences of religious
          opinions and forms of worship, excluded men of integrity and
          ability from serving their country." His published works are:
          Discourses on the Being and Perfections of God (2 vols., London,
          1740-43); Sermons (4 vols., 1748-51), with life by James Duchal;
          Tracts and Sermons (1751).

   Abert Friedrich Philip Von
          ABERT, ??´bert, FRIEDRICH PHILIP VON: Roman Catholic archbishop
          of Bamberg; b. at Mümnerstadt (35 m. n.n.e. of Würzburg) May 1,
          1852. He was educated at the Passau Lyceum (1870-71) and the
          University of Würzburg (Ph.D., 1875), and from 1875 to 1881 was
          active as a parish priest. In the latter year he was appointed
          an assistant at the episcopal clerical seminary at Würzburg, and
          four years later was made professor of dogmatics at the Royal
          Lyceum, Regensburg. In 1890 he was appointed professor of
          dogmatics and symbolics at Würzburg, where he was dean in
          1894-95,1899-1900, and rector in 1900-01. In 1905 he was
          consecrated archbishop of Bamberg. He has written Einheit des
          Seins in Christus nach der Lehre des heiligen Thomas von Aquin
          (Regensburg, 1889); Von den göttlichen Eigenschaften und von der
          Seligkeit, zwei dem heiligen Thomas von Aquin zugeschriebene

          and Das Wesen des Christentums nach Thomas von Aquin (1901).

   Abgar
          ABGAR (Lat. Abgarus): Name (or title) of eight of the kings
          (toparchs) of Osrhoene who reigned at Edessa for a period of
          three centuries and a half ending in 217. The fifteenth of these
          kings, Abgar V., Uchomo ("the black," 9-46 A.D.), is noteworthy
          for an alleged correspondence with Jesus, first mentioned by
          Eusebius (Hist. eccl., i. 13), who states that Abgar, suffering
          sorely in body and having heard of the cures of Jesus, sent him
          a letter professing belief in his divinity and asking him to
          come to Edessa and help him. Jesus wrote in reply that he must
          remain in Palestine, but that after his ascension he would send
          one of his disciples who would heal the king and bring life to
          him and his people. Both letters Eusebius gives in literal
          translation from a Syriac document which he had found in the
          archives of Edessa. On the same authority he adds that after the
          ascension the Apostle Thomas sent Thaddaeus, one of the seventy,
          to Edessa and that, with attendant miracles, he fulfilled the
          promise of Jesus in the year 340 (of the Seleucidan era = 29
          A.D.). The Doctrina Addæi (Addæus = Thaddæus; edited and
          translated by G. Phillips, London, 1876), of the second half of
          the fourth century, makes Jesus reply by an oral message instead
          of a letter, and adds that the messenger of Abgar was a painter
          and made and carried back with him to Edessa a portrait of
          Jesus. Moses of Chorene (c. 470) repeats the story (Hist.
          Armeniaca, ii. 29-32), with additions, including a
          correspondence between Abgar and Tiberius, Narses of Assyria,
          and Ardashes of Persia, in which the "king of the Armenians"
          appears as champion of Christianity; the portrait, he says, was
          still in Edessa. Gross anachronisms stamp the story as wholly
          unhistorical. Pope Gelasius I. and a Roman synod about 495
          pronounced the alleged correspondence with Jesus apocryphal. A
          few Roman Catholic scholars have tried to defend its genuineness
          (e.g. Tillemont, Mémoires, i., Brussels, 1706, pp. 990-997;
          Welte, in TQ, Tübingen, 1842, pp. 335-365), but Protestants have
          generally rejected it. See [23]Jesus Christ, Pictures and Images

   Abhedananda

          Vedanta propaganda in America; b. at Calcutta Nov. 21, 1866. He
          was educated at Calcutta University, and after being professor
          of Hindu philosophy in India went to London in 1896 to lecture
          on the Vedanta. In the following year he went to New York, where
          he has since remained, succeeding Swami Vivekananda as head of
          the Vedanta Society in America. Theologically he belongs to the
          pantheistic and universalistic Vedanta school of Hindu
          philosophy. His works include, in addition to numerous single
          lectures, Reincarnation (New York, 1899); Spiritual Unfoldment
          (1901); Philosophy of Work (1902); How to be a Yogi (1902);

   Abijah
          ABIJAH, a-bai´ja (called Abijam in I Kings xiv. 31, xv. 1, 7,
          8): Second king of Judah, son of Rehoboam, and, on his mother's
          side, probably a great-grandson of David, since his mother
          Maachah is called a daughter of Absalom (II Chron. xi. 20;
          "Abishalom," in I Kings xv. 2). In I Kings xv. 10, however,
          Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom, appears as mother of Asa;
          and in II Chron. xiii. 2 the mother of Abijah is called
          Michaiah, the daughter of Uriel. "Michaiah" here is probably a
          scribal error for "Maachah," the addition "daughter of
          Abishalom" in I Kings xv. 10 probably a copyist's mistake; and
          it is possible that Uriel was son-in-law of Absalom, and
          Maachah, therefore, his granddaughter. Abijah reigned three
          years (957-955 B.C. or, according to Kamphausen, 920-918). The
          Book of Kings says that he walked in all the sins of his father,
          which probably means that he allowed idolatrous worship, and
          adds that the war between Judah and Israel, which followed the
          division, continued during his reign. According to II Chronicles
          xiii., Abijah gained some advantages in the war, which, though
          soon lost, were not unimportant. He may have been in alliance
          with Tabrimon of Damascus (I Kings xv. 18-19). His history is
          contained in I Kings xiv. 31-xv. 8, and II Chron. xiii. 1-22.

          (W. Lotz.)

          According to the more correct chronology Abijah reigned 918-915
          B.C.

   Abilene
          ABILENE, ab´´i-lî´ne: A district mentioned in Luke iii. 1 as
          being under the rule of the tetrarch Lysanias. It is evidently
          connected with a town Abila, and Josephus (Ant., XVIII. vi. 10,
          XIX. v. 1, XX. vii. 1; War, II. xi. 5, xii. 8) indicates that
          the town in question was situated on the southern Lebanon. Old
          itineraries (Itinerarium Antonini, ed. Wesseling, Amsterdam,
          1735, p. 198; Tabula Peutingeriana, ed. Miller, Ravensburg,
          1887, x. 3) mention an Abila, eighteen Roman miles from
          Damascus, on the road to Heliopolis (Baalbek), the modem Suk
          Wady Barada, on the south bank of the river, in a fertile and
          luxuriant opening surrounded by precipitous cliffs. Remains of
          an ancient city are found on both banks of the river, and the
          identification is confirmed by an inscription (CIL, iii. 199)
          stating that the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus
          repaired the road, which had been damaged by the river, "at the
          expense of the Abilenians." The tomb of Habil (Abel, who is said
          to have been buried here by Cain), which is shown in the
          neighborhood, may also preserve a reminiscence of the ancient
          name, Abila. It has generally been assumed that the Lysanias
          intended by Luke was Lysanias, son of Ptolemy who ruled Iturea
          40-36 B.C. (Josephus, Ant., XIV. xiii. 3; War, I. xiii. 1). If
          this be correct, Luke, is in error, since he makes Lysanias
          tetrarch of Abilene in 28-29 A.D. It may be noted, however, that
          the capital of Iturea was Chalcis, not Abila; and Josephus does
          not include the territory of Chalcis in the tetrarchy of
          Lysanias. Furthermore, there is an inscription (CIG, 4521) of a
          certain Nymphaios, "the freedman of the tetrarch Lysanias," the
          date of which must be between 14 and 29 A.D. Hence it is not
          improbable that there was an earlier and a later Lysanias and
          that the latter is the one who is mentioned as tetrarch of
          Abilene.

   Abishai
          ABISHAI, ??-bish´?-?i: Elder brother of Joab and Asahel (I

          half-sister cf. II Sam. xvii. 25, where Zeruiah's sister Abigail
          is called daughter of Nahash; not of Jesse). His father is not
          mentioned. He was David's companion in his time of persecution
          (I Sam. xxvi. 6 sqq.), saved his life (II Sam. xxi. 17), and
          served him faithfully to the end of his reign. He was the first
          among the "thirty" in the catalogue of David's mighty men
          (xxiii. 18-19, reading "thirty" instead of "three;" cf.
          Wellhausen, Der Text der Bücher Samuelis, Göttingen, 1871, and
          Klostermann's commentary on Samuel ad loc.). While Joab was
          commander-in-chief Abishai often commanded a division of the
          army (against the Ammonites, II Sam. x. 10-14; against Edom, I
          Chron. xviii. 12; against Absalom, II Sam. xviii. 2; against
          Sheba, II Sam. xx. 6). He was valiant and true, but severe and
          passionate toward David's enemies (cf. I Sam. xxvi. 8; II Sam.
          iii. 30, xvi. 9, xix. 21).

   Abjuration
          ABJURATION: A formal renunciation of heresy required of converts
          to the Roman Catholic Church. The First and Second Councils of
          Nicæa insisted on a written abjuration from those who, after
          having fallen into the religious errors of the time, desired to
          be restored to membership in the Church. The necessity of
          abjuration is reaffirmed in the Decree of Gratian and in the
          Decretals of Gregory IX., and found an important place in the
          procedure of the Inquisition. This tribunal distinguished four
          kinds of abjuration, according as the heresy to be renounced was
          a matter of notoriety or of varying degrees of suspicion,--de
          formali, de levi, de vehementi, de violento. Abjuration of
          notorious heresy or of very strongly suspected heretical
          inclinations took the form of a public solemn ceremony. In
          modern times the Roman Inquisition requires that a diligent
          investigation shall be conducted regarding the baptism of
          persons seeking admission into the Church. If it is ascertained
          that baptism has not been received, no abjuration is demanded;
          if a previous baptism was valid, or was of doubtful validity,
          abjuration and profession of faith are necessary preliminaries
          to reception into the Church. A convert under fourteen years of
          age is in no case bound to abjure. The act of abjuration is
          attended with little formality,--all that is necessary is that
          it be done in the presence of the parish priest and witnesses,
          or even without witnesses if the fact can otherwise be proved.
          The modern formula of abjuration found in Roman Catholic rituals
          is really more in the nature of a profession of faith, the only
          passages savoring of formal renunciation of heresy being the
          following, "With sincere heart and unfeigned faith I detest and
          abjure every error, heresy, and sect opposed to the Holy,
          Catholic, and Apostolic, Roman Church. I reject and condemn all
          that she rejects and condemns."

   Ablon
          ABLON: Village on the left bank of the Seine, about 9 m. s. of
          Paris, noteworthy as the place where public worship was first
          conceded to the Protestants of Paris. Notwithstanding the edict
          of Nantes (May 2, 1598), the Protestants of the capital were not
          allowed a church within the city itself, but had to travel to
          Ablon. In 1602 they petitioned the King for a place nearer the
          city, alleging that during the winter forty children had died
          from being carried so far for baptism. In 1606 their petition
          was granted and the church was removed to Charenton, at the
          junction of the Seine and Marne, six or seven miles nearer the
          city. The toilsome and sometimes dangerous "expeditions" to
          Ablon are often spoken of by Sully and Casaubon.

   Ablutions
          ABLUTIONS OF THE MASS: The rubrics of the mass prescribe that
          immediately after communion the celebrant shall purify the
          chalice with wine, and his fingers with wine and water. These
          ablutions, as they are called, are drunk by the priest unless he
          is obliged to celebrate a second time on the same day, in which
          case he pours the wine and water of the last ablution into a
          special vessel, kept for the purpose near the tabernacle, and
          consumes them at the next mass. Pope Pius V. in 1570 introduced
          into his Missal the rubrics on this matter as they exist to-day.
          The first clear references to the ablutions as practised to-day
          are found in the eleventh century. Ablution of the hands is also
          prescribed before mass, before the canon, and after the
          distribution of communion outside of mass.

          which boasted of Davidic descent, at Lisbon 1437; d. in Venice
          1509. He was treasurer of Alfonso V. of Portugal, but was
          compelled to flee the country under his successor, John II., in
          1483. He lived in Spain until the Jews were expelled thence by
          Ferdinand and Isabella (1492), when he went to Naples. In both
          countries he rendered important services to the government as
          financier. From 1496 till 1503 he lived at Monopoli in Apulia,
          southern Italy, occupied with literary work, and later settled
          in Venice. He wrote commentaries on the Pentateuch (Venice,
          1579) and on the earlier and the later Prophets (Pesaro, 1520
          [?]) which show little originality, and are valuable chiefly for
          the extracts he makes from his predecessors. In his Messianic
          treatises (Yeshuot meshihho, "The Salvation of his Anointed,"
          Carlsruhe, 1828; Mayene ha-yeshuah, "Sources of Salvation,"
          Ferrara, 1551; Mashmia Yeshuah, "Proclaiming Salvation,"
          Salonica, 1526) he criticizes Christian interpretations of
          prophecy, but with no great insight. His religio-philosophical
          writings are less important. In the interest of Jewish orthodoxy
          he defends the creation of the world from nothing (in Mifalot
          Elohim, "Works of God," Venice, 1592) advocates the thirteen
          articles of faith of Maimonides (in Rosh amanah, "The Pinnacle
          of Faith," Constantinople, 1505). His eschatological
          computations made the year of salvation due in 1503.

          (G. Dalman.)

          Abrabanel held a place of some importance in the history of
          Christian exegesis due to the facts that he appreciated and
          quoted freely the earlier Christian exegetes and that many of
          his own writings were in turn condensed and translated by
          Christian scholars of the next two centuries (Alting, Buddæus,
          the younger Buxtorf, Carpzov, and others).

   Abraham
          ABRAHAM, ê´bra-ham or a´bra-ham.

          Sources of his Biography Analyzed (§ 1).

          Historicity of Abraham Defended (§ 2).

          Historicity of the Patriarchs Defended (§ 3).

          Impossibility of Fully Reconstructing the Sources (§ 4).

          This article will be limited to an attempt to establish the
          credibility of the tradition which represents Abraham as the
          first ancestor of the Israelites, against the arguments of those
          who doubt or deny the existence of the patriarch as an
          historical personage.

  1. Sources of His Biography Analyzed.

          Knowledge of Abraham's history must be derived exclusively from
          Gen. xi. 26-xxvi. 10. Other accounts--Josephus, Ant., I. vi.
          5-xvii; Philo, De Abrahamo, De migratione Abrahami, De congressu
          quærendæ eruditionis causa, De profugis, Quis rerum divinarum
          hæres sit; the haggadic narratives (collected by B. Beer, Leben
          Abrahams nach Auffassung der judischen Sage, Leipsic, 1859); the
          notices in Eusebius, Præparatio evangelica, ix. 16-20--are all
          excluded by their late origin. Many maintain that the Biblical
          narrative is also discredited for the same reason. It is true
          that the beginnings of the patriarchal history cannot be dated
          later than about 1900 B.C., and even if Genesis was written by
          Moses (c. 1300 B.C.) its account is from 500 to 600 years later
          than the life of Abraham. If, as so many believe, the present
          Genesis originated between 500 and 400 B.C., a period of from
          1,400 to 1,500 years intervenes. Whenever it may have been
          written, however, the Book of Genesis presents the conception of
          the life of Abraham current in the pious circles of Israel at
          the time of composition; and this conception may be shown to
          have been handed down from earlier periods. The narrative is a
          piecing together of the sources (E, J, and P) without essential
          additions by R. For the present purpose it matters little when P
          originated, since this portion of the narrative is a mere
          sketch, barren of details. It is generally assumed that E and J
          originated between the time of Jehoshaphat and Uzziah (850-750
          B.C.); others think it more probable that E belongs to the time
          of the Judges (c. 1100 B.C.), J to that of David (c. 1000 B.C.).
          If the latter assumption be correct, a combination of E and J
          (which are supplementary rather than contradictory) gives what
          passed for the history of Abraham at the end of the period of
          the Judges and at the beginning of the monarchy. The Book of
          Deuteronomy contains passages which imply facts and conceptions
          written down in EJ (cf. vi. 3, 10, 18; vii. 7, 8, 12, 13; viii.
          1, 18; ix. 5, 27; xiii. 18; xix. 8; xxvi. 3, 7, 15). If, then,
          Deuteronomy be Mosaic, the history of Abraham is traced back to
          the Mosaic time. It can not be the product of the inventive
          fancy of Israel during the sojourn in Egypt; for during the
          first half of the sojourn the patriarchal period was too near to
          admit of fancies, and during the oppression there was no thought
          of migrating to Canaan and settling there. It is thus quite
          improbable that fancy transformed wishes into promises once
          given to the fathers.

  2. Historicity of Abraham Defended.

          Most of the critics ascribe Deuteronomy to the last century of
          the monarchy of Judah. The narrative of EJ is, then, the oldest
          written attestation of Abraham; and the question arises, how far
          can this narrative be accepted as historical? If it is not
          historical the origin of its conception of Abraham must be
          explained. It has been suggested that Abraham was a deity adored
          in antiquity and afterward humanized (Dozy, Nöldeke, E. Meyer).
          But in all Semitic literature no god named Abraham is found; and
          no indication exists that Abraham was ever conceived of in
          Israel as a deity or higher being. More plausible is the view
          that Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were ethnographic collective
          names (Wellhausen, Prolegomena, Berlin, 1895, pp. 322 sqq.).
          Abraham in particular was a combination of Israelitic, Edomitic,
          Moabitic, and Ammonitic nations. These collective names were
          afterward conceived of as names of individuals of remote
          antiquity, to whom fancy involuntarily ascribed a history
          reflecting the views and wishes of the later period. But there
          is little to prove that the names of the patriarchs were
          originally collective names; and against the supposition is the
          fact that the Israelites did not call themselves after the name
          of Abraham but after that of Isaac, Jacob, Israel. Moreover, the
          picture of Abraham presented by EJ is not what one would expect
          Israel's fancy of the time of the Prophets to paint as the
          portrait pf a patriarch par excellence. Wellhausen says of the
          patriarchs as they appear in EJ: "They are not courageous and
          manly, but good house-masters, a little under the influence of
          their more judicious wives." It is hardly conceivable, that the
          Israel of the monarchy should have imagined as the type of an
          Israelite indeed a man without courage, devoid of manliness, and
          ruled by his wife. Abraham's faith and obedience are emphasized
          and he is depicted as interceding with Yahweh; but EJ also makes
          him marry his half-sister, which was incest according to the
          Israelitic conception; he took Lot with him against Yahweh's
          command; though Yahweh had promised him Canaan as his abode, he
          went thence to Egypt; more than once he endangered the honor of
          his wife; his faith is occasionally, though only momentarily,
          not free from doubt (Gen. xv. 8, xvii. 17, 18). If, then, the
          origin of Abraham as a fictitious personage can not be explained
          and traced, nothing remains but to conclude that his history
          rests upon tradition. Like all tradition, that of Abraham may
          contain inaccuracies, amplifications, or gaps; but the less it
          answers the expectation of an ideal form or can be proved to be
          a product of later times developed from the past, the greater is
          its claim to credibility.

  3. Historicity of the Patriarchs Defended.

          Another point raised against the historicity of the Biblical
          narratives of the patriarchs is that in the time of Moses, and
          later, Yahweh was a thunder-god dwelling on Sinai and was
          worshiped in a fetishistic manner by the Israelitic tribes,
          which at the same time were devoted to totemism. But this
          objection rests upon a rash inference, from single phenomena of
          the religious life at the time of Moses and the subsequent
          period, that the religious conceptions and usages of the
          Israelites were identical with those of the Arabs who lived two
          thousand years later in the time before Mohammed's appearance.
          The Israelites were not conscious of any special relationship
          with the Arabs, and the religion of the latter before Mohammed
          can not be proved to be a petrifaction of former millenniums.

          The effort to prove the patriarchs unhistorical from the
          narrative of the sending of the spies (Num. xiii.-xiv.)--because
          it appears questionable in that narrative whether it was worth
          while or possible for Israel to take Canaan, whereas on the
          basis of the history of the patriarchs both were certain--falls
          to the ground when it is remembered that the authors who wrote
          the story of the spies were fully convinced that Yahweh had
          promised Canaan to the fathers, and that they wrote with the
          supposition that no intelligent reader would see in their
          narrative a contradiction of this conviction. The most plausible
          objection to the historicity of the narratives of the patriarchs
          is the length of time between the events recorded and the origin
          of the documentary sources extant in Genesis. But that tradition
          may preserve a faithful record of former events especially where
          matters of a religious nature are concerned, will be denied only
          by those who judge the remote past by the conditions of the
          present. The Indians and the Gauls for centuries handed on their
          religious conceptions by means of oral tradition; and it is very
          possible that the authors of the documents of Genesis had
          records from very ancient, even pre-Mosaic, time. The
          possibility once admitted, that a faithful tradition concerning
          Abraham may have been preserved to the time when the documents
          of Genesis originated, the last reason for considering him a
          product of later Israelitic fancy, is removed.

  4. Impossibility of Fully Reconstructing the Sources.

          No one of the three sources which are pieced together in the
          present Genesis can be fully reconstructed. The document P must
          have contained much more material than the sum total of all the
          excerpts from it. The source E appears first with certainty in
          chapter xx.; and J, especially for Abraham's later years, is
          preserved only in fragments. There is thus no means of knowing
          all that the sources originally contained; and, furthermore,
          many passages of Genesis can be assigned with certainty neither
          to one nor another of the sources. Hence the accuracy and
          completeness of our knowledge of Abraham's history is dependent
          on the fidelity and good judgment with which the compiler of
          Genesis has done his work; and in attempting to delineate the
          true story of Abraham's life it is an imperative duty to weigh
          carefully the possibility and probability of each detail.

          (A. Köhler.)

          The historicity of the personal as distinguished from the tribal
          Abraham is still held by a wide though perhaps narrowing circle
          of scholars. In the above article the difficulties are too
          lightly treated. The embarrassing question of Abraham's date is
          disposed of (§ 1) by the assumption that it can not have been
          later than 1900 B.C. But Gen. xiv., by its Babylonian
          synchronism, puts it in the twenty-third century B.C., at least
          one thousand years before Moses, and fifteen hundred years
          before the generally accepted date of Abraham's first
          biographer. Moreover, practically nothing is known of the
          history of his descendants until the era of Moses. When we seek
          for at least a substantial personality amid the vagueness,
          inconsistencies, and contradictions direct or inferential, that
          mark the several accounts, we are thrown back upon the fact of
          the persistent general tradition, which evidently had a very
          early origin, and to which great weight should in fairness be
          attached.

   Abraham A Sancta Clara
          ABRAHAM A SANCTA CLARA: Monastic name by which a famous German
          preacher, Ulrich Megerle, is usually known; b. at
          Kreenheinstetten (20 m. n. of Constance), Baden, July 2, 1644;
          d. in Vienna Dec. 1, 1709. He was the son of an innkeeper, and
          received his education from the Jesuits at Ingolstadt and from
          the Benedictines at Salzburg. In 1662 he entered the order of
          the barefooted Augustinians, and rose to positions of authority,
          becoming prior of his house, provincial, and definitor. After
          1668 or 1669, with the exception of seven years (1682-89) spent
          at Graz, he was attached to the Augustinian Church in Vienna. He
          was primarily a preacher, and his first published works were
          reprints of sermons. His definite literary activity dates from
          the plague of 1679, which called forth three small books; but
          these, as well as similar occasional writings--such as Auf, auf,
          ihr Christen (1683), inspired by the danger of the Turkish
          invasion and imitated by Schiller in the Capuchin's address in
          Wallensteins Lager, viii.; Gack Gack (1685), a book for
          pilgrims; Heilsames Gemisch-Gemasch (1704)--are of comparatively
          slight importance. His principal work, Judas, der Erz-Schelm (4
          parts, 1686-95), is an imaginary biography of the betrayer of
          Christ, written from the standpoint of a satirical preacher.
          About the same time he wrote a compendium of moral theology,
          Grammatica religiosa (1691) in which the more dignified Latin
          precludes the characteristic pungent flavor of his vernacular
          works.

          Abraham represents the Catholicism of his age not in its
          noblest, but in its most usual form. He is fanatical, eager to
          make converts, intolerant; constant in praise of the Jesuits,
          full of the bitterest reproaches against Protestants and Jews.
          He has the most childish notions of science; but he makes very
          skilful use of his scanty equipment of learning. He has a
          perfect command of every rhetorical artifice, and knows how to
          play upon the feelings of his hearers, to appeal to their
          weaknesses, and to call up vivid pictures before their minds,
          not disdaining to raise a laugh. Satire is his strongest weapon;
          and he is a direct inheritor of the old German satiric
          tradition. He exercises the functions of a critic with the
          fearlessness of a mendicant friar; neither his audience, nor the
          court, nor his brethren of the clergy are spared. The burlesque
          manner which he uses in treating the most serious subjects was
          popular in the fifteenth century, and may have suited that age;
          but it was out of place in the second half of the seventeenth.
          The force of the contrast becomes apparent when it is remembered
          that Abraham was appointed court preacher in 1677, sixteen years
          after the same title had been conferred on a Bossuet. It is only
          fair, however, to recall what the general level of education was
          in Roman Catholic Germany at the time, and to see in Abraham
          rather a popular entertainer than a preacher.

          A complete edition of his works in twenty-one volumes was
          published at Passau and Lindau (1835-54), and selections at
          Heilbronn (7 vols., 1840-44) and Vienna (2 vols., 1846). Single
          works are accessible in many editions (Judas der Erz-Schelm,
          Stuttgart, 1882; Auf, auf, ihr Christen, Vienna, 1883).

   Abraham Ecchellensis
          ABRAHAM ECCHELLENSIS, ek´´el-en´sis: A learned Maronite; b. at
          Eckel, Syria, in the latter part of the sixteenth century; d. at
          Rome in 1664. He was educated in the college of the Maronites at
          Rome and was promoted to doctor of philosophy and theology. For
          a time he was professor of Arabic and Syriac at Pisa, and
          afterward at Rome, where he was called by Urban III. He was one
          of the first to promote Syriac studies in Europe, and his Syriac
          grammar (Rome, 1628) was long used. In 1640 he was called to
          Paris by Le Jay to assist in the Paris Polyglot. The Arabic and
          Syriac texts for this work had been entrusted to Gabriel
          Sionita, a Maronite professor at Paris, who performed his work
          in an unsatisfactory manner. Abraham agreed to undertake the
          books of Ruth, Esther, Tobit, Judith, Baruch, and Maccabees, on
          the ground that he possessed better codices than Gabriel. The
          latter, however, took offense; whereupon Abraham resigned the
          work and returned to Rome (1642), having edited only the books
          of Ruth and III Maccabees. He was attacked in four letters
          (Paris, 1646) by Valérien de Flavigny, who wrote on the side of
          his friend Gabriel, and a sharp controversy ensued (cf. A. G.
          Masch, Bibliotheca sacra, Halle, 1778, p. 358). During a second
          residence in Paris (1645-53) Abraham taught at the Sorbonne, and
          published the concluding volume of an edition of the works of
          St. Alithony (1646; vol. i., containing the letters, had
          appeared in 1641), as well as Catalogus librorum Chaldæorum
          auctore Hebed Jesu (1653) and Chronicon orientale (1653), a
          history of the patriarchate of Alexandria, translated from the
          Arabic of Ibn al-Rahib, with an appendix treating of Arabia and
          the Arabs before Mohammed. In 1653 he returned to Rome. He
          published two works in answer to the views of [31]John Selden
          concerning the early position of the episcopate, viz., De
          origine nominis papæ (Rome, 1660) and Eutychius patriarcha
          Alexandrinus vindicatus (1661).

   Abrahamites
          ABRAHAMITES: A deistic sect which appeared in the district of
          Pardubitz, eastern Bohemia, after 1782. They claimed to hold to
          the faith of Abraham before his circumcision; rejected most of
          the Christian doctrines, but professed belief in one God, and
          accepted, of the Scriptures, only the Decalogue and the Lord's
          Prayer. The government took measures against them, and they were
          soon suppressed. The name was also applied to the followers of
          one Abraham (Ibrahim) of Antioch at the beginning of the ninth
          century; they were charged with idolatrous and licentious
          practises, probably on insufficient grounds, and may have been
          related to the Paulicians.

          Seminary (Rock Island, Ill.), graduating in 1880. He entered the
          Lutheran ministry in the same year, and in 1886 was called to
          the pastorate of the Salem Lutheran Church, Chicago, where he
          has since remained. He was associate editor of Augustana, the
          official organ of the Augustana Synod, from 1885 to 1896, and
          for six years was president of the Illinois Conference of the
          same synod. He is also a member of the board of directors of
          Augustana College and Theological Seminary, president of the
          board of directors of Augustana Hospital, Chicago, a member of
          the board of missions of the Augustana Synod and the Illinois
          Conference, and was a delegate to the International Lutheran
          World's Congress at Lund, Sweden, in 1901. In 1894 he received
          the Swedish decoration of Knight Royal of the Order of the Polar
          Star from King Oscar II. In theology he belongs to the historic
          Evangelical Lutheran Church, and adheres to its original
          unaltered creeds. He has written Jubel Album (Chicago, 1893).

   Abrasax
          ABRASAX, ab´r?-sax (ABRAXAS, ab-rax´as).

          Various Explanations (§ 1).

          The Abrasax Gems (§ 2).

          Abrasax (which is far commoner in the sources than the variant
          form Abraxas) is a word of mystic meaning in the system of the
          Gnostic Basilides, being there applied to the "Great Archon"
          (Gk., megas archOn), the princeps, of the 365 spheres (Gk.,
          ouranoi; cf. Hippolytus, Refutatio, vii. 14; Irenæus, Adversus
          hæreses, I. xxiv. 7). Renan considers it a designation of the
          most high, unspeakable God lost in the greatness of his majesty;
          but he has probably been misled by erroneous statements of the
          Fathers, such as Jerome on Amos iii. ("Basilides, who calls the
          omnipotent God by the portentous name abraxas'"), and
          pseudo-Tertullian (Adversus omnes hæreses, iv.: "he [Basilides]
          affirms that there is a supreme God by the name Abraxas'").

  1. Various Explanations.

          Much labor has been spent in seeking an explanation for and the
          etymology of the name. Salmasius thought it Egyptian, but never
          gave the proofs which he promised. Münter separates it into two
          Coptic words signifying "new fangled title." Bellermann thinks
          it a compound of the Egyptian words abrak and sax, meaning "the
          honorable and hallowed word," or "the word is adorable." Sharpe
          finds in it an Egyptian invocation to the Godhead, meaning "hurt
          me not." Others have endeavored to find a Hebrew origin. Geiger
          sees in it a Grecized form of ha-berakhah, "the blessing," a
          meaning which King declares philologically untenable. Passerius
          derives it from abh, "father," bara, "to create," and a-
          negative--"the uncreated Father." Wendelin discovers a compound
          of the initial letters, amounting to 365 in numerical value, of
          four Hebrew and three Greek words, all written with Greek
          characters: ab, ben, rouach, hakadOs; sOteria apo xylou
          ("Father, Son, Spirit, holy; salvation from the cross").
          According to a note of De Beausobre's, Hardouin accepted the
          first three of these, taking the four others for the initials of
          the Greek anthrOpoussOzOn hagiOi xylOi, "saving mankind by the
          holy cross." Barzilai goes back for explanation to the first
          verse of the prayer attributed to Rabbi Nehunya ban ha-Kanah,
          the literal rendering of which is "O [God], with thy mighty
          right hand deliver the unhappy [people]," forming from the
          initial and final letters of the words the word Abrakd
          (pronounced Abrakad), with the meaning "the host of the winged
          ones," i.e., angels. But this extremely ingenious theory would
          at most explain only the mystic word Abracadabra, whose
          connection with Abrasax is by no means certain. De Beausobre
          derives Abrasax from the Greek habros and saO, "the beautiful,
          the glorious Savior." It is scarcely necessary to remark upon
          the lack of probability for all these interpretations; and
          perhaps the word may be included among those mysterious
          expressions discussed by Harnack (Ueber das gnostische Buch
          Pistis-Sophia, TU, vii. 2, 1891, 86-89), "which belong to no
          known speech, and by their singular collocation of vowels and
          consonants give evidence that they belong to some mystic
          dialect, or take their origin from some supposed divine
          inspiration." That the numerical value of the letters amounts to
          365, the number of the heavens of Basilides and of the days of
          the year, was remarked by the early Fathers (Irenæus,
          Hippolytus, the pseudo-Tertullian, and others); but this does
          not explain the name any more than it explains Meithras and
          Neilos, of which the same is true. And the number 365 is made
          use of not only by Basilides, but by other Gnostics as well.

  2. The Abrasax Gems.

          The Gnostic sect which comes into light in Spain and southern
          Gaul at the end of the fourth century and at the beginning of
          the fifth, which Jerome connects with Basilides, and which
          (according to his Epist., lxxv.) used the name Abrasax, is
          considered by recent scholars to have nothing to do with
          Basilides. Moreover, the word is of frequent occurrence in the
          magic papyri; it is found on the Greek metal tesseræ among other
          mystic words, and still more often on carved gems. The fact that
          the name occurs on these gems in connection with representations
          of figures with the head of a cock, a lion, or an ass, and the
          tail of a serpent was formerly taken in the light of what
          Irenæus says (Adversus hæreses, I. xxiv. 5) about the followers
          of Basilides: "These men, moreover, practise magic, and use
          images, incantations, invocations, and every other kind of
          curious art. Coining also certain names as if they were those of
          the angels, they proclaim some of these as belonging to the
          first, and others to the second heaven; and then they strive to
          set forth the names, principles, angels, and powers of the 365
          imagined heavens." From this an attempt was made to explain
          first the gems which bore the name and the figures described
          above, and then all gems with unintelligible inscriptions and
          figures not in accord with pure Greco-Roman art, as
          Abrasax-stones, Basilidian or Gnostic gems. Some scholars,
          especially Bellermann and Matter, took great pains to classify
          the different representations. But a protest was soon raised
          against this interpretation of these stones. De Beausobre,
          Passerius, and Caylus decisively declared them to be pagan; and
          Harnack has gone so far as to say that it is doubtful whether a
          single Abrasax-gem is Basilidian. Having due regard to the magic
          papyri, in which many of the unintelligible names of the
          Abrasax-gems reappear, besides directions for making and using
          gems with similar figures and formulas for magical purposes, it
          can scarcely be doubted that these stones are pagan amulets and
          instruments of magic.

   Absalon (Axel)
          ABSALON (AXEL): Archbishop of Lund (1178-1201), one of the
          principal figures in Scandinavian medieval history; b. on the
          island of Zealand, then under his father's government, probably
          in Oct., 1128; d. in the abbey of Sorö (on the island of
          Zealand, 44 m. w.s.w. of Copenhagen) Mar. 21, 1201. He was
          brought up with the future king Waldemar, amid surroundings
          which befitted his birth. When he was eighteen or nineteen, his
          father retired from the world to the Benedictine monastery of
          Sorö, which he had built, and the lad went to Paris to study
          theology and canon law. He came back to Denmark to find civil
          war raging among the partizans of three princes. As he was
          already a priest, he probably took no part in the bloody battle
          of Gradehede near Viborg (1157) which finally decided the strife
          in favor of his old playmate Waldemar; but in the following
          spring he and his retainers repelled an attack of Wendish
          pirates who were ravaging Zealand. When Bishop Asser of Roskilde
          died (on Good Friday, 1158), the chapter and the citizens
          quarreled over the choice of a successor, and the armed
          intervention of Waldemar became necessary. At an election held
          in his presence, Absalon was unanimously chosen, and soon showed
          that he considered the defense of his country not the least
          among his episcopal duties. The Danes now assumed the offensive
          against the pagan Wends, and two campaigns were made against
          them in 1159. The next year Waldemar joined forces with Henry
          the Lion, with the result that Mecklenburg was added to the
          German territory, and the island of Rügen to the Danish.

          All this time Absalon was busy building fortresses and providing
          guards for the coasts, sometimes undertaking perilous winter
          voyages to inspect the defenses, with the aspect of a Viking but
          the spirit of a crusader. At the same time he was laboring for
          internal peace by endeavoring to attach the partizans of the
          defeated factions to the king, and busily providing for monastic
          reform and extension. He brought to Denmark his old fellow
          student William, canon of St. Geneviève at Paris, and placed him
          over the canons of Eskilsö near Roskilde, whose house he later
          removed to Ebelholt near Arresö, helping them to build their new
          church and richly endowing it. After his father's death (c.
          1157) discipline had decayed among the Benedictines of Sorö, and
          Absalon brought Cistercian monks from Esrom to restore it,
          making it one of the richest of Cistercian abbeys. He and his
          kinsfolk were buried in the great church there which he began to
          build after 1174. In 1162 he accompanied Waldemar to St. Jean de
          Laune on the Saône, where Frederick Barbarossa solemnly
          recognized Victor IV. as the legitimate pope and banned
          Alexander III. and his adherents. Absalon was much dissatisfied
          with this result; he desired Waldemar to refuse the oath of
          allegiance to the emperor, and induced him to withdraw from the
          sitting in which Alexander was denounced. He also protested
          later when Victor IV. undertook to consecrate a bishop for
          Odense, and was supported in his attitude by the bishops of
          Viborg and Börglum and by most of the monastic communities,
          while Archbishop Eskil of Lund took the same position so
          strongly that he had to spend seven years in exile at Clairvaux.
          The bishops of Sleswick, Ribe, Aarhus, and Odense were on the
          side of the imperial pope.

          In the fresh campaigns against the Wends, between 1164 and 1185,
          Absalon took an active part, winning from his contemporaries the
          name of pater patriæ. In 1167 the king gave him the town of Havn
          (Copenhagen), and he erected a strong fortress, which was of
          great importance for the development of commerce. He was active
          in establishing a system of tithes, which aroused much
          opposition. The disturbances in Eskil's jurisdiction (he had now
          become reconciled with the king) induced him to resign his
          archbishopric, naming Absalon as his successor. The latter
          accepted his promotion unwillingly, and was allowed to retain
          the see of Roskilde for thirteen years after his assumption of
          the higher office in 1178. As archbishop he withdrew more and
          more from political activity to devote himself to the interests
          of the Church. The part taken by the Danes in the third crusade
          was no doubt due to his influence. He was a strong upholder of
          clerical celibacy, and the purity of his own life was
          universally admired. He is also credited with having done much
          for liturgical uniformity; and it was at his wish that Saxo, one
          of his clergy, undertook to write his Historia Danica, one of
          the most important sources for Danish history.

   Abulfaraj
          ABULFARAJ (Abu al-Faraj ibn Harun, commonly called Bar Hebræus;
          his real name was Gregory): Syriac writer and bishop; b. in the
          Cappadocian town of Melitene (200 m. n.e. of Antioch) 1226; d.
          at Maragha (60 m. s. of Tabriz), Azerbaijan, Persia, July 30,
          1286. He belonged to a Jewish family which had gone over to
          Jacobite Christianity, but whether his father or a more remote
          ancestor made the change is uncertain. He finished his studies
          at Antioch and lived for a time there as a monk in a cave; he
          went to Tripoli, Syria, to perfect himself in medicine (his
          father's profession) and rhetoric; became bishop of Gubos, near
          Melitene (1246), of Lakabhin (1247), of Aleppo (1253); maphrian
          (primate) of the Jacobites in Chaldea, Mesopotamia, and Assyria,
          with his seat at Takrit on the Tigris (1264). It was the time of
          the Mongol inroads under Hulaku, and the country was sorely
          devastated; but by his discretion and the high repute in which
          he was held at the Tatar court, Abulfaraj was able to do much to
          ameliorate the condition of the Christians. As a writer his
          importance is due to his wide acquaintance with the knowledge of
          his time; his works are exceedingly numerous upon the most
          diverse subjects. A few of them are in Arabic, but the greater
          number in Syriac.

          The modern Abyssinia is a country of East Africa, between the
          Red Sea and the Blue Nile, to the southeast of Nubia. Its
          boundaries are not definite, and its area is variously given
          from 150,000 to 240,000 square miles. Estimates of the
          population vary from 3,500,000 to 8,500,000. In antiquity the
          term "Ethiopia" was used rather vaguely to signify Abyssinia
          (with somewhat wider extent than at present), Nubia, and Sennar.
          These were the lands of the Ethiopian Church, of which the
          Abyssinian Church is the modem representative. Christianity is
          now confined to the plateau and mountain regions of Abyssinia.

  1. Worthlessness of Traditional History.

          Native tradition ascribes the name of the country and the
          foundation of the state to Ethiops, the son of Cush, the son of
          Ham. The queen of Sheba who visited Solomon is identified with
          an Abyssinian queen, Makeda; and her visit is said to have led
          to the conversion of the people to Judaism. The tradition
          continues that she bore to Solomon a son, Menelik, who was
          educated in Jerusalem by his father. He then returned to the old
          capital, Axum, and brought with him both Jewish priests and the
          ark, which was carried away from the Temple in Jerusalem and
          deposited in the Ethiopian capital; and from that time to the
          present Abyssinia is said to have been ruled by a Solomonic
          dynasty, the succession having been broken only now and then by
          usurpers and conquerors. Of course, all this has no historic
          value. That Judaism preceded Christianity in the land is not
          proved by the observance of certain Jewish customs (such as
          circumcision, the Mosaic laws about foods, the Sabbath, etc.);
          these may have been introduced from ancient Egypt or the Coptic
          Church. A Jewish immigration, however, must have taken place, as
          it is proved by the presence in the land of numerous Jews, the
          so-called Falashas (see below, [38]§ 7); but the time, manner,
          and magnitude of this immigration can not be ascertained.

  2. Introduction of Christianity.

          There is no independent native tradition of the conversion of
          the Abyssinians to Christianity According to the Greek and Roman
          Church historians (Rufinus, i. 9; Theodoret, i. 22; Socrates, i.
          19; Sozomen, ii. 24), in the time of Constantine the Great
          (about 330), Frumentius and Edesius accompanied the uncle of the
          former from Tyre on a voyage in the Red Sea. They were
          shipwrecked on the Ethiopian coast and carried by the natives to
          the court at Axum. There they won confidence and honor, and were
          allowed to preach Christianity. Edesius afterward returned to
          Tyre; but Frumentius continued the work, went to Alexandria,
          where Athanasius occupied the patriarchal see, obtained
          missionary coworkers from him, and was himself consecrated
          bishop and head of the Ethiopian Church, with the title Abba
          Salama, "Father of Peace," which is still in use along with the
          later Abuna, "Our Father." It is not improbable that
          Christianity was known to the Abyssinians before the time of
          Frumentius (whose date has been fixed by Dillmann at 341); but
          he is properly regarded as the founder of the Ethiopian Church.
          In the fifth and sixth centuries the mission received a new
          impulse by the immigration of a number of monks (Monophysites)
          from upper Egypt.

  3. Close Connection with Egypt in Doctrine.

          The close connection between the Abyssinian Church and Egypt is
          very apparent in the sphere of doctrine. Like the Coptic Church,
          the Abyssinian holds a monophysitic view of the person of
          Christ. This question has long been settled; but it is still
          debated whether Christ had a double or threefold birth. The
          Abuna and the majority of the priests hold to the twofold view,
          which is the more purely monophysitic. The threefold view was
          introduced by a monk about 100 years ago, and is prevalent in
          Shoa (the southern and southeastern district). Also the
          questions of the person and dignity of Mary, whether she really
          bore God, or was only the mother of Jesus; whether she is
          entitled to the same worship as Christ, etc.,--are eagerly
          debated though it seems to be the general view that an almost
          divine worship is due to the Virgin, and that she and the saints
          are indispensable mediators between Christ and man. Some even
          assert that the saints, who died not for their own sins, died
          like Christ for the sins of others.

  4. The Canon and Creed.

          The church books are all in the Ethiopic language, which is a
          dead tongue, studied only by the priests, and not understood by
          them. For the Ethionic Bible translation see [39]Bible Versions,
          A, VIII. The Abyssinian canon, called Semanya Ahadu,
          "Eighty-one," because it consists of eighty-one sacred books,
          comprises, besides the sixty-five books of the usual canon, the
          Apocrypha, the Epistles of Clement, and the Synodus (that is,
          the decrees of the Apostolic Council of Jerusalem; cf. W. Fell,
          Canones apostolorum Æthiopice, Leipsic, 1871). Only a very
          slight difference, however, is made between this canon and some
          other works of ecclesiastical literature,--the Didascalia or
          Apostolic Constitutions (text and transl. by T. P. Platt,
          published by the Oriental Translation Fund, London, 1834); the
          Haimanot-Abo, giving quotations from the councils and the
          Fathers; the writings of the Eastern Fathers, Athanasius, Cyril,
          and Chrysostom; and the Fetha-Nagast, the royal law-book. On the
          whole, the tradition of the Church has the same authority as the
          Scriptures. Of the councils, only those before the Council of
          Chalcedon (451) are recognized, because at Chalcedon the
          monophysite heresy was condemned. The Apostles' Creed is
          unknown; the Nicene is used.

  5. Organization of the Church.

          At the head of the Church stands the Abuna, who resides in
          Gondar. He is appointed by the Coptic patriarch of Cairo; and,
          according to a law, dating from the thirteenth century, no
          Abyssinian, but only a Copt, can be Abuna. He alone has the
          right to anoint the king and to ordain priests and deacons. Both
          in secular and in ecclesiastical affairs he has great power. The
          duties of the priests are to conduct divine service three or
          four times daily and for three or four hours on Sunday, to
          attend to the church business, and to purify houses and
          utensils. Priests, monks, and scholars celebrate the Holy
          Communion every morning. The deacons bake the bread for the
          Lord's Supper and perform menial duties. Any one who can read
          may be ordained deacon, and a priest is merely required to
          recite the Nicene Creed. To learn the long liturgies, however,
          is often a matter of years. It is usual to marry before
          ordination, as marriage is not allowed afterward. Besides
          priests and deacons each church has its alaka, who looks after
          church property and attends to secular business. The debturas
          sing at divine service; and the larger churches have a komofat
          who settles disputes among the clergy. Beside the secular clergy
          stand the monastic under the head of the Etsh'ege, who ranks
          next to the Abuna and decides many ecclesiastical and
          theological questions in common with him. The number of monks
          and nuns (living after the rule of Pachomius) is very great. At
          Debra Damo, one of the chief monasteries, about 300 monks live
          together in small huts. A part of their duties is the education
          of the young. The church buildings are exceedingly numerous,
          generally small, low, circular structures, with a conical roof
          of thatch and four doors, one toward each of the cardinal
          points. Surrounding the building is a court, occupied during
          service by the laymen, and often serving at night as a place of
          refuge to travelers. The interior, dirty and neglected, is
          divided into two apartments,--the holy for the priests and
          deacons, and the holy of holies, where stands the ark. This ark
          is the principal object in the whole church. Neither the
          deacons, laymen, nor non-Christians dare touch it; if they do,
          the church and the adjacent cemetery become unclean, and must be
          purified. Indifferent pictures of the numerous saints, the
          Virgin, the angels, and the devil adorn the interior; but
          statues are forbidden. Crosses are found, but no crucifixes.

  6. Beliefs and Practises.

          Service consists of singing of psalms, recitals of parts of the
          Bible and liturgy, and prayers, especially to the Virgin and the
          wonder-working saints; it is undignified and unedifying. They
          believe that every one has a guardian spirit and therefore
          venerate the angels. The archangel Michael is considered
          especially holy. They divide the good angels into nine classes,
          of which there were originally ten, but one fell away under
          Satanael. Relics are preserved and venerated as by the Roman
          Catholic Church. Of sacraments, the Church numbers two, baptism
          and the Lord's Supper. Both adults and children are baptized,
          the former by immersion, the latter by sprinkling. For boys the
          rite is performed forty days after birth; for girls, eighty
          days. The purpose of baptism is the forgiveness of sins. The
          Lord's Supper is preceded by a severe fast; and offerings of
          incense, oil, bread, and wine are usually brought. The Jewish
          Sabbath is kept as well as the Christian Sunday; and altogether
          there are one hundred and eighty holidays in the year. Fasting,
          observed with great strictness, plays a prominent part in the
          discipline, and about half the days of the year are nominally
          fast-days.

  7. The Falashas.

          Not all the inhabitants of Abyssinia are Christians; and not all
          Christians belong to the State Church. The Zalanes, a nomadic
          tribe, consider themselves to be Jews, and keep aloof from the
          Christians, though they are described as being really
          Christians. The Chamantes are baptized, and have Christian
          priests; but in reality they are nearly pagans, and celebrate
          many thoroughly pagan rites. The real Jews, the Falashas, live
          along the northern shore of Lake Tsana, in the neighborhood of
          Gondar and Shelga, where they pursue agriculture and trade. They
          are more industrious than the Christians, but also more ignorant
          and spiritually more forlorn. Mohammedanism is steadily
          progressing. In order to distinguish themselves from all
          non-Christians, the Christians receive at baptism a cord of blue
          silk or cotton, called mateb, which they always wear around the
          neck.

  8. Christian Missions.

          The first missionary work which the Western Church undertook in
          Abyssinia was the Jesuit mission of 1555, which labored there
          for nearly a century; but the missionary activity of the Jesuits
          was deeply mixed with the politics of the country; and their
          main purpose seems to have been to establish there the authority
          of the Roman Catholic Church. At last they reached the goal.
          After a frightful massacre of the opposite party, King Sasneos
          declared the Roman Catholic Church the Church of the State. In
          1640, however, the Jesuits, with their Roman archbishop, were
          compelled to leave the country, and the old religion with its
          old Church was reestablished. With the new Abuna who followed
          after this Roman Catholic interregnum, Peter Heyling, from
          Lübeck, a Protestant missionary, came into the country, but his
          great zeal led only to small results. The Church Missionary
          Society had more success in the first half of the nineteenth
          century. The circumstance that a pious Abyssinian monk, Abi-Ruch
          or Abreka, who had been guide to the traveler Bruce, translated
          the whole Bible into the Amharic language (1808-18), gave the
          first occasion to this attempt. The British and Foreign Bible
          Society bought and printed the translation, and in 1830 the
          missionaries Gobat and Kugler were sent to Abyssinia. The latter
          was succeeded by Isenberg, and Gobat by Blumhardt in 1837. Later
          came Krapf. The work was partly spoiled by the opposition of the
          native priests and the intrigues of newly arrived Roman
          Catholics, and the missionaries were expelled in 1838. Krapf
          then spent three years in Shoa, but was driven thence in 1842.
          The Roman Catholics were expelled in 1854. In 1858 a Coptic
          priest who had frequented the school of a Protestant missionary
          in Alexandria, and favored the Protestant mission, became Abuna,
          and the St. Chrischona Society of Basel now sent a number of
          Protestant missionaries into the country. They labored with
          considerable success; but the disturbances of the reign of King
          Theodore overtook them, and almost destroyed their work. They
          were thrown into prison and were only released after the victory
          of the British.

          Since that time, few missionary attempts have been made in
          Abyssinia. The Swedes have one or two stations in the country;
          and during the past ten years there has been some effort to
          resume work on the part of the Roman Catholics (mainly French).
          There is a vicar apostolic for Abyssinia with residence in
          Alitiena, Tigre; and a Uniat "Geez Church" is said to number
          10,000 members. See [40]Africa, II., [41]Abyssinia.

          ACACIUS, ?-kê´shi-us, OF BEROEA: A monk of the monastery of
          Gindanus near Antioch, afterward abbot of a monastery near
          Beroea (Aleppo), and from 378 bishop of that city; d. about 435.
          He took an active part in the ecclesiastical controversies of
          the East, and was one of the principal complainants against
          Chrysostom at the synod held in 403 in a suburb of Chalcedon
          known as Ad Quercum. For this reason he fell out with Rome, but
          was acknowledged again by Innocent I. in 415. In the Nestorian
          controversy he occupied a mediating position. The Syrian Balæus
          wrote five songs in his praise. His extant writings are a letter
          to Cyril of Alexandria and two to Alexander of Hierapolis, as
          well as a confession of faith (MPG, lxxvii. 1445-48).

   Acacius of Cæsarea
          ACACIUS OF CÆSAREA: One of the most influential bishops in the
          large middle party which opposed the Nicene Creed during the
          Arian controversy. He was the disciple of Eusebius, and his
          successor in the bishopric of Cæsarea. He took part in the
          Eusebian synod at Antioch in the spring of 341, and in another
          at Philippopolis in 343. By the orthodox council of Sardica in
          the same year he was regarded as one of the heads of the
          opposing party, and threatened with deposition. Common
          opposition to the Nicene doctrine held the party together until
          about 356. Thus, on the death of Maximus of Jerusalem (350 or
          351), Acacius helped to get the vacant see for Cyril, who
          belonged rather to the opposite wing of the party, the later
          Homoiousians or Semi-Arians. That he fell out with Cyril and
          procured his deposition (357 or 358) was due partly to jealousy
          between the two sees, partly to the changed attitude of parties
          under Constantius (351-361). The two wings fell apart, and
          Acacius became the leader of the court party, the later
          Homoians, in the East. In 355 he seems to have been one of the
          few Easterns who represented the emperor at the Council of
          Milan; and, according to Jerome, his influence with Constantius
          was so great that he had much to do with setting up Felix as
          pope in the place of the banished Liberius. After the so-called
          Second Council of Sirmium (357) had avoided the controverted
          terms altogether and said nothing about the ousia ("substance"),
          it was undoubtedly Acacius who at the Council of Antioch (358)
          influenced Eudoxius to accept this compromise for the East. At
          the Synod of Seleucia (359) he took a prominent part. In obvious
          concert with the imperial delegates, he seemed to favor what
          Ursacius and Valens tried to carry in the Synod of Rimini, the
          acceptance of the so-called third Sirmian formula ("similar
          [homoios] according to the Scriptures . . . similar in all
          things"). He and his party, it is true, expressly condemned the
          anomoios ("dissimilar") theory, but they omitted the "in all
          things," which agreed as little with the real views of Acacius
          as with those of the Western Homoians. The council ended in a
          schism; the Homoiousian majority, in a separate session, deposed
          Acacius and other leading Homoians. But he was in touch with the
          court; and at the discussions in Constantinople which continued
          those of Seleucia, the imperial wishes, represented by Acacius,
          Ursacius, and Valens, prevailed. He was able to celebrate his
          victory the next year at the Council of Constantinople, and
          commanded the situation in the East. With the death of
          Constantius the day of this imperial orthodoxy was done; and
          under Jovian (363-364) Acacius succeeded in accepting the Nicene
          orthodoxy which was now that of the court. His name appears
          among the signatures of those who, at the Synod of Antioch
          presided over by Meletius (363), accepted the Nicene formula in
          the sense of homoios kat' ousian ("similar as to substance").
          With the accession of the Arian Valens (364), the situation
          changed once more; and apparently Acacius changed with it. He
          and his adherents were deposed by the Homoiousian Synod of
          Lampsacus (365), after which he is heard of no more; probably he
          soon died. He was a voluminous writer, but nothing remains
          except the formula of Seleucia, a fragment in Epiphanius
          (Adversus hæreses, lxxii. 6-10; MPG, xlii. 589-596) of his
          polemic against Marcellus, and scattered quotations in some of
          the Catenæ.

          (F. Loofs.)

          Along with Eunomius and Aetius, Acacius may be said to have
          given dialectic completeness to Arianism. In their polemics
          against the Nicene Symbol they laid chief stress on the fact
          that the Father was "unbegotten," depending for his being
          neither upon himself nor another, which could not be said of the
          Son. They insisted also upon the complete comprehensibility of
          God.

   Acca
          ACCA, ak´k?: Fifth bishop of Hexham (18 m. w. of Newcastle,

          [43]Wilfrid of York, shared his missionary labors in Friesland
          and Sussex, accompanied him to Rome in 704, and succeeded him as
          bishop in 709. He was also the intimate friend of Bede, who
          received help and encouragement from Acca in his scholarly
          labors, and dedicated to him his Hexameron and several of his
          commentaries. Acca seems to have been worthy of his friends. He
          completed and adorned the buildings begun at Hexham by Wilfrid
          and collected there a large and excellent library. He was a good
          musician, and induced a famous singer, Maban by name, to come to
          Hexham and instruct the rude Northumbrians. In 732 he was
          expelled from his bishopric for some unknown reason, but
          returned before his death.

          1. Pietro Accolti: "The Cardinal of Ancona"; b. at Florence
          1455; d. at Rome Dec. 12, 1532. He studied law, but later
          entered the Church, and was made bishop of Ancona and cardinal
          by Julius II. He was the author of the famous bull of 1520
          against Luther.

          2. Benedetto Accolti: "The Cardinal of Ravenna," nephew of the
          preceding; b. at Florence, Oct. 29, 1497; d. there Sept. 21,
          1549. He belonged to the college of abbreviators under Leo X.,
          and was made a cardinal by Clement VII. in 1527. In 1535 Paul
          III. for some obscure reason imprisoned him in the castle of St.
          Angelo; and he obtained his release after some months only by
          payment of a large sum of money. He left some Latin writings
          including a few poems (published in Quinque illustrium poetarum
          carmina, Florence, 1562).

  1. Greek Philosophical and Theological Usages.

          The word "Accommodation" is used in theology in two senses: (1)
          the wider, that of a general ethical conception; and (2) the
          narrower, by certain writers of the latter half of the
          eighteenth century, in reference to a particular method of
          Biblical exegesis. The ethical reserve denoted by this term was
          known to the Greek philosophers as synkatabasis, and the same
          word is used by the Greek Fathers for that method of teaching
          which adapts itself to the needs or to the preconceived ideas of
          the scholars; the expression kat' oikonomian didaskein is also
          employed, whence the word "economy" is often applied to this
          method by later writers.

  2. Required by Ethics.

          Such accommodation or economy is required by ethics in two
          cases: (1) when, in a spirit of love, it spares a condition of
          ignorance existing in another's mind, or (2) when, in the same
          spirit, it keeps back some truth which the imperfect state of
          development of the other is not ready to receive. Love bids to
          have patience with erring or weak consciences, so long as they
          are unconscious of their error or weakness, and therefore might
          be more injured than helped by a too hasty attack (I Cor. viii.
          9-13). The aim must be improvement, not punishment--that one may
          "by all means save some." This consideration, however, is not
          due to conscious and obstinate sinners, in which case it would
          be a denial of duty for the sake of pleasing men. But this duty
          has its limits; it imports and enforces certain ethical
          requirements and certain spiritual truths; and in both cases its
          action must be adapted to the capacity of the receiver. The very
          nature of the human mind prescribes gradual progress in
          knowledge; and thus Christian teaching often requires reserve
          and silence, where strict enforcement of the command or full
          unfolding of the truth might give offense. Thus Christ kept back
          from his disciples certain things which they could not yet bear
          (John xvi. 12); and thus Paul does not exact the same
          requirements from all members of the churches under his care (I
          Cor. vii. 17, 26, 35 sqq.), feeding the "babes in Christ" with
          "milk, and not with meat" (I Cor. iii. 2). The Christian teacher
          can not, indeed, preach a different gospel to different hearers;
          but the manner of the preaching and the selection of material
          will vary with the stages in spiritual growth attained by the
          hearers. To this manner belong such things as the popular
          exposition of the truth, the use of comparisons and examples,
          and argumenta ad hominem. This kind of accommodation is not only
          not blameworthy, but is prescribed by the example of Christ.

  3. Negative Accommodation.

          The use of accommodation in matter, as distinguished from
          manner, is more disputable. It may be either negative,
          dissimulatio, when the teacher passes over in silence the
          existence of erroneous ideas in his scholars; or positive,
          simulatio, when he distinctly approves such erroneous ideas or
          consciously sets them forth as the truth, with the purpose in
          both cases of thus leading by an indirect road to the truth.
          Negative accommodation may be justified pedagogically by the
          fact that no teacher is in a position to remove all obstacles at
          one stroke, the gradual process being equivalent to a toleration
          of a certain amount of error for the time. Thus no reproach can
          lie against Christ because in some particulars he allowed his
          disciples to remain temporarily under the influence of false
          impressions, as long as he did this not by declared approval and
          with the distinct looking forward to the time when the Spirit of
          Truth should lead them into all truth; this covers the Jewish
          beliefs and practises which they were allowed to retain in his
          very presence. The apostles also tolerated the continued
          existence of numerous ancient errors in their converts, being
          sure that these would fall away with their gradual growth in
          Christian knowledge (I Cor. ix. 20 sqq.; Rom. xiv. 1 sqq.; Heb.
          v. 11 sqq.).

  4. Positive Accommodation.

          The case is quite different, however, with regard to positive
          accommodation in the matter of the teaching. There is no purely
          objective system of commandments, the same for all alike.
          Ethical law is subjective, varying with the individual and his
          circumstances--position, calling, age, sex, and the like. One is
          not to be a slave to prevailing customs, but is bound to take
          them into account, so as not to offend others. The same thing
          applies to prevailing beliefs and views; a man has to consider
          that he will be judged by his contemporaries according to the
          standards of the time and place; nay, that if he is to be
          understood by them at all, he must accommodate himself to their
          standpoint, and speak to a certain extent as they speak. This
          leads to a point which has been in the past vehemently discussed
          by theologians. The truth just stated was pressed by certain
          writers for the purpose of rendering more acceptable their
          doctrines in regard to revelation. It is their attitude which
          gave rise to the narrower meaning of the word "accommodation."

  5. Modern Theory of Accommodation.

          A transition to the theory that many things in the Bible are to
          be taken as spoken only in this accommodated sense is to be
          found in the treatise of Zachariä, Erklärung der Herablassung
          Gottes zu den Menschen (Schwerin, 1762): it asserted that the
          revelations of God in the Old Testament, the establishment of
          the old and new covenants, the incarnation of Christ--in other
          words, the facts of revelation in general--were only set forth
          as an "accommodation" of God to men. It was seen that this
          struck at the very root of the Christian faith; and the question
          was hotly discussed how far many Biblical expressions were mere
          concessions to the ideas prevalent at the time. The controversy
          lasted until the rise of the modern critical school, early in
          the nineteenth century, afforded an easier way of meeting the
          difficulties which these theologians had thus sought to avoid.
          With the help of their theory, such writers as Behn, Senf,
          Teller, Van Hemert, and Vogel sought to bring about a harmony
          between their views of reason and the Scriptural expressions.
          Thus, for example, they got rid of the Messianic prophecies
          which, they said, Jesus referred to himself merely to convince
          the Jews that he was the Messiah, without himself believing that
          they were written of the Messiah; the doctrine of angels and
          devils was simply a use of the common conceptions; that of the
          atonement becomes only a condescension of the same kind to
          popular ideas, intended to reconcile the Jews to the loss of
          their sacrifices.

  6. Untenableness of the Theory.

          In more recent times this theory has been increasingly
          recognized as scientifically and theologically untenable. It is
          of course, obvious that many expressions of Christ and the
          apostles relate to merely local and temporal circumstances, and
          do not contain permanent rules of conduct. The apparent
          contradictions between revelation and the facts of physics and
          chemistry offer no more difficulty; Christ did not come to teach
          natural science; and he was obliged to adapt himself to current
          forms of expression in order to be understood, just as one
          speaks of the rising and setting of the sun, when he knows it is
          the motion of the earth and not that of the sun which is
          referred to. But there is no case of concession to real error,
          still less of assertion of error, in any of this accommodation.

  7. When Accommodation is Admissible.

          As to the general ethical use of accommodation, a case may arise
          in which one is bound by the law of love not to make use of a
          liberty which in the abstract he possesses, lest the weaker
          brethren should be scandalized. From this point of view Paul
          lays down his rule in regard to the eating of meats offered to
          idols (I Cor. viii. 13). In like manner one may be bound, like
          Paul again, by the love of his neighbor to do something he would
          not otherwise do (Acts xvi. 3, xxi. 17 sqq.). Paul's acceptance
          of Timothy's circumcision was no concession to error; he did not
          cease to teach that the rite was unnecessary for Gentile
          converts; and he stoutly resisted an attempt to impose it on
          Titus (Gal. ii. 3-5). Limitations which he willingly imposed on
          his own personal liberty in the accommodation of pastoral wisdom
          would have been unworthy weakness if he had yielded to them when
          imposed by others when the circumstances did not justify them.
          This is the standpoint of the Formula Concordiæ (art. x.) in
          reference to the [47]Adiaphora. In such matters, what in itself
          is innocent and may be used with Christian freedom becomes, when
          it is sought to be imposed as an obligation, an attack on
          evangelical liberty which must be resisted.

          (Rudolf Hofmann.)

  8. Accommodation and the New Testament.

          The theory of theological accommodation, so far as it is drawn
          from the New Testament, grows out of a particular conception of
          the knowledge of Christ and the scope of inspiration. (1) If one
          holds that Christ possessed complete knowledge of all matters
          relating to the natural world, the Old Testament, the events of
          his own time, and the future of the kingdom of God on earth, he
          may affirm either that all of Christ's teaching on these
          subjects is authoritative and final, or else that in many
          instances he fitted his teaching to the immediate needs of his
          hearers; in the latter case, one could not be sure as to the
          precise nature of the objective fact. (2) If, how ever, it be
          alleged that Jesus's intelligence followed the laws of human
          growth, that he shared the common scientific, historical, and
          critical beliefs of his day, and that for us his knowledge is
          restricted to the spiritual content of revelation, then his
          allusions to the natural world, to persons, events, books, and
          authors of the Old Testament, to demons, and the like are to be
          interpreted according to universal laws of human intelligence;
          thus the principle of accommodation drops away. (3) In like
          manner, inspiration may be conceived of either as equipping the
          sacred writers with an accurate knowledge concerning all things
          to which they refer, and yet leading them to fit their
          communications to the temporary prejudice or ignorance of their
          readers, or as quickening their consciousness concerning
          spiritual truth, while they were left unillumined about matters
          which belong to literary, historical, or scientific inquiry. It
          is thus evident that the question of theological accommodation
          in the New Testament turns in part on a solution of two previous
          questions--the content of our Lord's knowledge, and the scope of
          inspiration in the authors of the various books (cf. C. J.
          Ellicott, Christus Comprobator, London, 1892; J. Moorhouse, The
          Teaching of Christ, ib. 1892; H. C. Powell, The Principle of the
          Incarnation, ib. 1896; G. B. Stevens, The Theology of the New

  9. Controversy in the Roman Catholic Church.

          Under the title "Accommodation Controversy" is also frequently
          understood the long and bitter dispute between the Jesuits and
          the Dominicans as to the extent of lawful concessions to the
          prejudices of their pagan hearers by missionaries. The Jesuits
          were the first to preach Christianity in China--Xavier went
          there in 1552. They were attacked by the Dominicans and
          Franciscans, when, forty years later, these orders entered the
          same field, on the charge of having made an improper compromise
          with Chinese beliefs, especially in regard to the practise of
          ancestor worship and to the name adopted to designate the
          Supreme Being in Chinese. They maintained, however, that such
          concessions were an inevitable condition of the toleration of
          Christian missions in the empire. The "Chinese rites" were
          provisionally forbidden by Innocent X. in 1645, but were again
          tolerated by Alexander VII. in 1656, on the ground that they
          might be regarded as purely civil ceremonies. Clement IX. took a
          middle course in 1669; but at the end of the century the
          controversy broke out with renewed violence, to be terminated
          only by a bull of Clement XI. in 1715, absolutely prohibiting
          the "Chinese rites." The legate Mezzabarba attempted to mitigate
          the strict enforcement of this ruling; but Benedict XIV.
          confirmed it in 1742, with the result of provoking a severe
          persecution which almost exterminated Christianity in China. A
          somewhat similar controversy raged in the eighteenth century
          over the so-called Malabar rites, terminated in the same sense
          by the bull Omnium sollicitudinum of Benedict XIV. (1742), the
          pope refusing, even at the cost of imperiling the future of
          missions, to permit any compromise with paganism. A heated
          controversy on the general subject of accommodation was provoked
          in England by the publication of No. 80 in the Oxford Tracts for
          the Times, On Reserve in Communicating Religious Knowledge,
          written by [48]Isaac Williams, which caused the author to be
          accused of Jesuitical and un-English insincerity, and provoked
          additional antagonism to the Oxford movement.

   Achelis, Ernst Christian
          ACHELIS, ERNST CHRISTIAN: Reformed Church of Germany; b. at
          Bremen Jan. 13, 1838. He studied theology at Heidelberg and
          Halle from 1857 to 1860, and was pastor successively at Arsten
          near Bremen (1860-62), Hastedt, a suburb of Bremen (1862-75),
          and Barmen-Unterbarmen (1875-82). Since 1882 he has been
          professor of practical theology in the University of Marburg. He
          is president of the Marburg branch of the Evangelischer Bund, a
          member of the Freie deutsche evangelische Konferenz, and since
          1888 has been the representative of the University of Marburg at

   Achery, Jean Luc
          ACHERY, ??´´shê´´rî´, JEAN LUC d' (Dom Luc d'Achery; Lat.
          Dacherius): Benedictine; b. at St. Quentin (80 m. n.e. of
          Paris), Picardy, 1609; d. in Paris Apr. 29, 1685. He entered the
          Benedictine order while still very young, and in 1632 joined the
          congregation of St. Maur at Vendôme. He was of weak constitution
          and suffered much physically, which led his superiors to send
          him to Paris. There he became librarian of St. Germain-des-Prés,
          and for forty-five years lived solely for his books and
          scholarly work. He took especial delight in searching out
          unknown books and bringing unprinted manuscripts to publication,
          and was ever ready to help others from his vast store of
          learning. His chief work was the Spicilegium veterum aliquot
          scriptorum qui in Galliæ bibliothecis, maxime Benedictinorum,
          latuerant (13 vols., Paris, 1655-77; 2d ed., by De la Barre,
          with comparison of later-found manuscripts by Baluze and
          Martène, 3 vols., 1723, better arranged but less correct). He
          edited the first edition of the Epistle of Barnabas (1645), the
          life and works of Lanfranc (1648), the works of Guibert of
          Nogent (1651), and the Regula solitariorum of a certain priest
          Grimlaic (1656); he compiled a catalogue of ascetic writings
          (1648); and he gathered the material for the Acta sanctorum
          ordinis S. Benedicti, which was published by his scholar and
          assistant, Mabillon (9 vols., 1668-1701), and for which the
          latter has usually received the credit.

   Acoemeti
          ACOEMETI, ??-sem´e-t?i or ??´´cei-mê´tî,-tê ("Sleepless"): An
          order of monks who sang the divine praises in their monasteries
          night and day without cessation, dividing themselves into three
          choirs for the purpose and undertaking the service in rotation.
          A certain Alexander (ASB, Jan., i. 1018-28) founded their first
          monastery on the Euphrates about the year 400, and a second at
          Constantinople. The abbot Marcellus spread the custom in the
          East. Monks from his monastery were transferred in 459 by the
          consular Studius to the monastery newly founded by him in
          Constantinople and called, after his name, the Studium, which
          later became famous. The members of the order are sometimes
          called Studites. In the controversy with the [50]Theopaschites
          they opposed the views of the papal legate, and in 534 they were
          disavowed and excommunicated by Pope John II.

          G. Krüger.

   Acolyte
          ACOLYTE: A member of the highest of the minor orders of the
          Roman Catholic Church. The order was established in the fourth
          or fifth decade of the third century, at the same time as the
          other minor orders, probably by Pope Fabian (236-250), but was
          not known to the East. The name (from the Gk. akolouthos, "a
          follower, attendant") indicates that the acolyte was originally
          the personal attendant of the bishop or of the presbyters. In
          this capacity he appears in Cyprian's epistles, where acolytes
          carry letters and fraternal gifts as directed by their bishop;
          and the same thing is seen in Augustine's time. This close
          connection with the higher clergy explains the position of the
          acolytes at the head of the minor orders. In the year 251 the
          local Roman Church had not less than forty-two acolytes
          (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., VI. xliii. 11). When the canonical age
          for the different orders was fixed, acolytes were required to be
          under thirty (Siricius, Ad Himerium, xiii.; 385 A.D.). In the
          Middle Ages the liturgical functions of the acolyte assumed
          greater prominence, including the charge of the altar-lights and
          the eucharistic wine. In Rome the acolytes were divided by
          special assignment among the various churches and regiones of
          the city. Since the close of the Middle Ages, the order has had
          only a nominal existence, though the Council of Trent (Session
          xxiii., De reform., xvii.) expressed a desire to see it restored
          to its former practical activity. In his investigation of the
          origin of the minor orders, Harnack has given Fabian as the
          founder of that of the acolytes; but he considers that it was an
          imitation of the pagan ritual system, in which special
          attendants (calatores) were assigned to the priests. However,
          this and the other minor orders may perfectly well have grown
          out of the needs of the Church without any copying of the pagan
          system.

          H. Achelis.

          Since the Middle Ages the order has been understood as
          conferring the right to act as official assistant of the
          subdeacon in a solemn mass. No canonical age is now explicitly
          prescribed, but the requirement of a knowledge of Latin excludes
          the very young.

          university Feb. 11, 1600. He joined the Jesuits as early as
          1553. In 1571 he went to the West Indies and later became second
          provincial of Peru. He wrote Confessionario para los curas de
          Indios, in Kechua and Aymara (1583), perhaps the first book
          printed at Lima; a catechism in Spanish and the native tongues
          (Lima, 1585); De natura novi orbis et de promulgatione evangelii
          apud barbaros (Salamanca, 1589), which he afterward translated
          into Spanish and incorporated in the Historia natural y moral de
          las Indias (Seville, 1590; Eng. transl., The Natural and Moral
          History of the East and West Indies, London, 1604), one of the

   Acosta, Uriel
          ACOSTA, URIEL (originally Gabriel da Costa): Jewish rationalist;
          b. at Oporto, Portugal, 1594; d. at Amsterdam 1647. He belonged
          to a noble family of Jewish origin but Christian confession, and
          was educated as a Roman Catholic. In early manhood he wished to
          return to the faith of his fathers; and, as an open change from
          Christianity to Judaism was not allowed in Portugal, he fled to
          Amsterdam, where he was circumcised and admitted to the
          synagogue. Disappointed in the teaching and practise of the
          Amsterdam Jews, he criticized them unsparingly; in particular he
          aroused their resentment by declaring that the Law made no
          mention of the immortality of the soul or a future life. After
          the publication of his Examen dos tradiçoens phariseas
          conferidas con a ley escrita (1624) they put him out of the
          synagogue and brought him to trial before the magistrates on a
          charge of atheism. He was imprisoned, fined, and his book was
          burned. After some years he made public recantation of his
          alleged errors, was scourged in the synagogue, and trampled upon
          at the door. According to rumor, he died by his own hand. He
          left an autobiography, Exemplar humanæ vitæ, published by Philip
          Limborch (Gouda, 1687; republished in Latin and German, with
          introduction, Leipsic, 1847).

          biographies of holy persons, especially of the older Church. The

          death for the faith; the latter is more general, including all
          "saints," i.e., Christians canonized by the Church on account of
          their eminently pious and pure lives.

I. Acts of Martyrs.

  1. Acta Martyrum Sincera.

          (Acta sive passiones martyrum; Martyrologia): The oldest
          authentic sources for the history of the early martyrs are the
          court records of the Roman empire (Acta proconsularia,
          præsidialia). They are not preserved in their original form, but
          more or less complete extracts from them constitute the kernel
          of the passion histories recorded by Christian hands; and they
          are acknowledged to be the authentic bases of these histories
          (cf. the works of Le Blant and Egli cited below), which, so far
          as they are based upon these official documents and thus
          demonstrate that they belong to the class of acta martyrum
          sincera, are either written in the form of a letter or are
          devotional narratives without the epistolary character
          (passiones, gesta martyrum). The former class includes the
          oldest of these histories; the chief examples are: the Passio
          Polycarpi, in a letter of the congregation of Smyrna, of which
          extracts are given by Eusebius (Hist. eccl., IV. xv.), while the
          complete text is handed down in five Greek manuscripts; the
          letter of the churches of Lyons and Vienne to the Christians of
          Asia and Phrygia concerning their sufferings under Marcus
          Aurelius in 177 (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., V. i.-iii.); the report
          of the Alexandrian bishop Dionysius to the Antiochian Fabianus
          on the sufferings of the Christians of his church during the
          persecutions under Decius (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., VI.
          xli.-xlii.); and certain reports concerning North-African
          martyrs and confessors of the same time, in Cyprian's collection
          of epistles (xx., xxi., xxii., xxvii., xxxix., xl., etc.).

          Passions in narrative force are more numerous. Among the oldest
          and historically most important are: From the second century,
          the Acta Justini philosophi et martyris; the Acta Carpi, Papyli,
          et Agathonicæ (cf. Eusebius, IV. xv. 48); the Passio sanctorum
          Scilitanorum of the year 180, a report of the martyrdom at
          Carthage of six Numidian Christians under the proconsul
          Vigellius Saturninus July 17, 180, distinguished by its strictly
          objective form, reproducing the official proconsular acts
          without Christian additions; the Acta Apollonii, belonging to
          the time of Commodus (cf. Eusebius, V. xxi.). To the third
          century belong the Passio Perpetuæ et Felicitatis, covering the
          martyrdom of certain Carthaginian Christians, belonging probably
          to Tertullian's congregation, Mar. 7, 203; the martyrdom of
          Pionius (cf. Eusebius, IV. xv. 47), of Achatius, and of Conon,
          all three belonging to the epoch of Decius; the Acta
          Proconsularia which record the trial and execution of Cyprian of
          Carthage under Valerianus, Sept. 14, 258. Finally, belonging to
          the beginning of the fourth century (the time of persecution
          under Diocletian and his coemperors, 303-323), there are the
          records collected by Eusebius, which now form an appendix to
          book VIII. of his church history, and treat of the Palestinian
          martyrs of that time, as well as somewhat numerous martyria of
          the period, to which must be ascribed a greater or less
          historical value (such as the Testamentum xl martyrum from
          Sebaste in Armenia, belonging to the time of Licinius, the newly
          discovered Greek text of which has full documentary value).

  2. Legendary Acts.

          Much greater than the number of such acta martyrum sincera sive
          genuina is that of the non-authentic histories of martyrs which
          contain little or nothing of contemporaneous notices and have an
          essentially legendary character. To these belong, among others:
          two accounts of the martyrdom of Ignatius of Antioch; the
          Martyrium Colbertinum and the Martyrium Vaticanum; the Acta
          Nerei et Achillei; the Passio Felicitatis et septem filiorum;
          the Acta S. Cypriani et Justinæ; the legends of [51]St. Agnes,
          [52]St. Cecilia, [53]St. Catherine, [54]St. Maurice, and others.

  3. Calendaria and Gesta Martyrum.

          After the cessation of persecutions the memory of the martyrs
          was cherished mainly by two kinds of written records: (1)
          calendaria, i.e., lists of the names of martyrs in calendar form
          for the purpose of fixing their memorial days for the liturgical
          use of individual congregations or greater church dioceses; (2)
          more detailed memorial books (gesta martyrum) for the purpose of
          private devotion and instruction, incorporating also longer
          passion narratives, and avoiding as much as possible the putting
          together of mere names in calendary statistical form. Of the
          latter kind may have been that copious collection of
          martyrological material from all branches of the Church which
          Eusebius composed in addition to the booklet on the Palestinian
          martyrs already mentioned (cf. his references to this
          collection, Hist. eccl., IV. xv. 47; V. Proem., iv. 3; also V.
          xxi. 5), but which was lost at a very early period (cf. Gregory
          the Great, Epist., viii. 29). Biographical and other notices
          were gradually added to the names of the martyrs in many of the
          calendaria; and by such inclusion of general hagiological matter
          they somewhat approached the character of the devotional
          reading-books. This enrichment of the calendaria with material
          not strictly martyrological in its nature (i.e., additions of a
          narrative character, not mere names) commenced in the West.
          While a calendarium of the Syriac Church from the year 412 (ed.
          W. Wright, 1865) still shows a strictly martyrological
          character, the old calendar of the Roman congregation from the
          year 354 (ed. Ægidius Bucher, Antwerp, 1633; T. Mommsen, in
          Abhandlungen der sächsischen Gesellschaft der Wissenschaften,
          1850) gives, besides the names of martyrs, those of Roman
          bishops (twelve in number). The same is true of the Calendarium
          Africanum vetus from the year 500, edited by Mabillon (Vetera
          Analecta, iii. 398 sqq.). The martyrologium of the Church of
          Rome mentioned by Gregory the Great in his epistle to Eulogius
          of Alexandria (Epist., viii. 29) consisted of martyrological and
          non-martyrological (especially papal) elements, and had even
          admitted the older Roman festival calendar. The so-called
          Martyrologium Hieronymianum is an enlarged revision of this
          Roman calendar. In its present form it is a compilation edited
          about the year 600 at Auxerre in Gaul; but it was previously
          recast in upper Italy, as is indicated in the correspondence of
          the alleged author Jerome, with the bishops Chromatius of
          Aquileia and Heliodorus of Altinum, which stands at the
          beginning. It is a medley of names of places and saints, data of
          martyrs, and the like, collected from older local and provincial
          calendars. The Syriac calendarium already mentioned was used (in
          a somewhat enlarged form) by the compiler as a source of
          information for the East; for North Africa a Calendarium
          Carthaginense (probably from pre-Vandalic times) was used; and
          for Rome, no doubt, the Roman martyrologium to which Gregory the
          Great referred. Jerome probably contributed nothing to the
          collection (cf. the critical edition of the work, ed. J. B. de
          Rossi and L. Duchesne, from numerous manuscripts, in ASB, Nov.,
          ii., 1894, and the criticism of B. Krusch in Neues Archiv für
          ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde, xx., 1895, 437-440). To still
          later times belong similar compilations ascribed to the
          Venerable Bede, to Florus Magister of Lyons (c. 840), to the
          abbot Wandelbert of Prüm (848), and others (see below, [55]II.,
          2).

          II. Histories of the Saints (Acta sive vitæ sanctorum):

          From the end of the fourth century, under the influence of the
          Vitæ patrum, disseminated at first from the Eastern but soon
          also from the Western monasteries, true biographies of the
          saints became much more numerous. The biographies contained in
          the Historia monachorum of Rufinus, the Historia Lausiaca of
          Palladius, the Historia religiosa of Theodoret, as well as in
          other works like the Pratum spirituale of Johannes Moschus, and
          the Vitæ patrum and Libri miraculorum of Gregory of Tours,
          furnish much more devotional matter than the histories of
          martyrs of former centuries. This hagiological literature, of
          monastic origin, had the advantage that it was not so much
          exposed to suspicion of falsification by heretics or the
          incompetent (idiotæ) as were productions of the older passion
          literature (the reading of which in divine service in the Roman
          Church was forbidden by edict of Gelasius I. in 494). Under the
          influence of the new kind of biographies of monks and hermits a
          general hagiological element entered also to an ever-increasing
          degree into the martyrological collections of the older type,
          and thus brought about their constant expansion.

  1. In the Churches of the East.

          In the Churches of the East, the older calendary statistical
          form of the compilations, confining itself to martyrological
          material proper and serving only liturgical purposes, was still
          cultivated, especially in the so-called menologia, or monthly
          registers, as well as in the liturgical anthologia
          ("collections"). But besides these arose hagiological
          collections of considerable copiousness: the menæa arranged in a
          calendary form and divided according to months; and shorter,
          condensed synaxaria (from synaxis, "religious gathering") or
          extracts. In the Byzantine Church the large collection of
          legends by Simeon Metaphrastes (10th cent.), which is preserved
          in a greatly revised and corrupt form, exercised much influence
          (see [56]Simeon Metaphrastes). Of the editors of the
          martyrologies and menoea literature of the Syriac Church in the
          earlier time, [57]Stephan Evodius Assemani deserves mention,
          more recently Paul Bedjan (Acta martyrum et sanctorum Syriace, 7
          vols., Paris, 1890-97); of those of the Russian Orthodox Church,
          [58]Joseph Simonius Assemani, and in recent times J. E. Martinov
          (Annus ecclesiasticus Græco-Slavicus, Brussels, 1863,--ASB,
          Oct., xi. 1-385) and V. Jagic ("The Menæa of the Russian Church
          from Manuscripts of 1095-97," St. Petersburg, 1886, Russian); of
          those of the Armenian Church, the [59]Mekhitarists, who
          published a martyrologium in two volumes at Venice in 1874; and
          of those of the Coptic Church, H. Hyvernat (Les Actes des
          martyrs de l'Égypte, Paris, 1886 sqq.).

  2. In the Western Church.

          In the Western Church, during the Middle Ages the hagiological
          literature, critically considered, deteriorated. Ado of Vienne
          and Usuardus (both c. 870); the author of the Martyrologium
          Sangalense (c. 900); Wolfard of Herrieden (c. 910); later,
          especially Jacobus de Voragine (d. 1298), author of the
          so-called "Golden Legend," and Petrus de Natalibus (d. 1382),
          author of a Catalogus sanctorum (often reprinted since 1493),
          are the main representatives of the writers of this legendary
          literature, of whose eccentricities and extravagancies humanists
          and reformers often complain. Since the end of the fifteenth
          century efforts have been made to publish critically genuine and
          older texts. Early attempts were: the Sanctuarium of Boninus
          Mombritius (Venice, 1474; Rome, 1497); the first (and only)
          volume of the Martyrum agones of Jacobus Faber Stapulensis
          (1525); and the De probatis sanctorum historiis of the
          Carthusian Laurentius Surius (d.1578; arranged according to the
          calendar; 6 vols. folio, Cologne, 1570 sqq.; 2d ed., 7 vols.,
          1581 sqq.). As concerns the abundance of matter and critical
          treatment of the documents, these first labors of modern times
          are far surpassed by the gigantic hagiological work the Acta
          Sanctorum quotquot toto orbe coluntur, the publication of which
          began at Antwerp in 1643. It was conceived by the Jesuit
          [60]Heribert Rosweyde; and after his death (1629) was undertaken
          by Jan Bolland and others. From the name of the first actual
          editor it is generally known as the Acta Sanctorum Bollandi or
          Bollandistarum (cited in this encyclopedia as ASB). With the
          exception of a period somewhat less than fifty years, consequent
          upon the disturbances of the French Revolution, the labor of
          preparation and publication has proceeded continuously to the
          present time, when the editors (following the calendary
          arrangement) are engaged upon the month of November (see
          [61]Bolland, Jan, Bollandists). More or less valuable are the
          extracts from the Bollandist main work in collections like that
          of Alban Butler (The Lives of the Fathers, Martyrs, and Other
          Principal Saints, 4 vols., London, 1756-59; see [62]Butler,
          Alban), his French imitator, the Abbé J. F. Godescard (Vies des
          Pères, des martyrs et autres principaux saints, traduit
          librement de l'anglais d' Alban Butler, 12 vols., Paris, 1763
          sqq.), and A. Räss and N. Weiss, the German successors of both
          Butler and Godescard (Leben der Heiligen, 23 vols., Mainz, 1823
          sqq.); mention may also be made of a later French work by Paul
          Guérin, Les Petits Bollandistes (7th ed., 18 vols., Paris,
          1876). In lexical form the lives of the saints are treated by
          the Abbé Pétin (Dictionnaire hagiographique, 2 vols., Paris,
          1850) and J. E. Stadler and F. J. Heim (Vollständiges Heiligen
          lexikon, 5 vols., Augsburg, 1858 sqq.). There are also
          hagiological collections devoted to the members of particular
          orders, of which the Acta Sanctorum ordinis S. Benedicti of J.
          Mabillon and others (9 vols., Paris, 1668-1701) is the most
          important.

  3. English Lives of Saints.

          The best-known work in English is that of Alban Butler, already
          mentioned. It is written in a heavy eighteenth century style.
          Much pleasanter reading is the work of Sabine Baring-Gould, The
          Lives of the Saints (15 vols., London, 1872-77; new illustrated
          ed., revised and enlarged, 16 vols., 1897-98). The author is a
          High-church Anglican, not untouched by the modern critical
          spirit. He states in his introduction that his work is not
          intended to supplant Butler, being prepared on somewhat
          different lines. Butler "confined his attention to the
          historical outlines of the saintly lives, and he rarely filled
          them in with anecdote. Yet it is the little details of a man's
          life that give it character and impress themselves on the
          memory. People forget the age and parentage of St. Gertrude, but
          they remember the mouse running up her staff." The style is
          diversified by occasionally introducing translations and
          accounts by other writers. The Sanctorale Catholicum, or Book of
          Saints, by Robert Owen (London, 1880), is a single octavo volume
          of 516 pages, provided with critical, exegetical, and historical
          notes. The Saints in Christian Art (3 vols., London, 1901-04),
          by Mrs. Arthur George Bell (née Nancy Meugens, known also by the
          nom de plume "N. d'Anvers"), contains sketches of the lives of
          the saints treated, written with little discrimination as to
          sources and in an uncritical, credulous spirit. The Saints and
          Servants of God is a series of lives, original and translated,
          edited by Frederick William Faber and continued by the
          Congregation of St. Philip Neri (42 vols., London, 1847-56). A
          second series was begun in 1873, in which the lives for the most
          part are translations of those drawn up for the processes of
          canonization or beatification. Another series, consisting of
          single-volume lives of various saints, specially prepared by
          modern writers, is being issued in authorized English
          translation under the editorship of Henri Joly for the original
          (French) volumes, and of the Rev. Father George Tyrrell, S.J.,
          for the translations (Paris and London, 1898 sqq.).

          A number of works are devoted to saints of the British Isles. As
          to the older works of this character Baring-Gould remarks
          (Introduction, i., pp. xxix.-xxx., ed. 1897):

          "With regard to England there is a Martyrology of Christ Church,
          Canterbury, written in the thirteenth century, and now in the
          British Museum; also a Martyrology written between 1220 and 1224
          from the southwest of England; this also is in the British
          Museum. A Saxon Martyrology, incomplete, is among the Harleian
          MSS. in the same museum; it dates from the fourteenth century.
          There is a transcript among the Sloane MSS. of a Martyrology of
          North-English origin, but this also is incomplete. There are
          others, later, of less value. The most interesting is the
          Martiloge in Englysshe after the use of the churche of
          Salisbury, printed by Wynkyn de Worde in 1526, reissued by the
          Henry Bradshaw Society in 1893. To these Martyrologies must be
          added the Legenda of John of Tynemouth, 1350; that of Capgrave,
          1450, his Nova legenda, printed in 1516; Whitford's Martyrology,
          1526; Wilson's Martyrologe, 1st ed., 1608, 2d. ed., 1640 and
          Bishop Challoner's Memorial of Ancient British Piety, 1761."

          Bishop Challoner's larger Britannia Sancta, or the Lives of the
          Most Celebrated British, English, Scottish, and Irish Saints (2
          parts, London, 1745) may also be mentioned. The Saints and
          Missionaries of the Anglo-Saxon Era, by D. C. O. Adams (2 ser.,
          Oxford, 1897-1901), is a collection of brief and popular lives
          brought down to Queen Margaret of Scotland (d. 1093). A Menology
          of England and Wales, compiled by Richard Stanton, priest of the
          Oratory, London (London, 1887; Supplement, 1892), is probably
          the fullest list in existence of names of English and Welsh
          saints, with brief biographical notices. It is a scholarly work
          based upon sources (calendars, martyrologies, legends,
          histories, acts) many of which were previously inedited. A
          somewhat wide interpretation is given to the terms "English" and
          "saint." The Lives of the Irish Saints, with Special Festivals,
          and the Commemoration of Holy Persons, by John O'Hanlon, is an
          exhaustive work, in somewhat florid style, arranged according to
          the calendar, one volume being devoted to each month (Dublin,
          1875 sqq.). Scottish calendars have been edited, with brief
          biographies of the saints, by A. P. Forbes in his Kalendars of
          Scottish Saints (Edinburgh, 1874). For Wales there is W. J.
          Rees's Lives of the Cambro-British Saints of the Fifth and
          Immediate Succeeding Centuries (Llandovery, 1853), Cardinal John
          Henry Newman's Lives of the English Saints (15 vols., London,
          1844-45, and often) is more interesting now for the history of
          the movement which called it forth than as a contribution to
          hagiology. See also the bibliography of the article [63]Celtic
          Church in Britain and Ireland.

   Acton, John Emerich Edward Dalberg
          ACTON, JOHN EMERICH EDWARD DALBERG, first Baron Acton: Roman
          Catholic layman; b. in Naples, Italy, Jan. 10, 1834; d. at
          Tegernsee (31 m. s. of Munich) June 19, 1902. He was educated at
          Oscott College, Birmingham, from 1843 to 1848, then at
          Edinburgh, finally at the University of Munich. At Oscott the
          president, Nicholas Wiseman, afterward archbishop and cardinal,
          greatly influenced him, but at Munich the greater scholar, Dr.
          Döllinger, still more. These men fostered his love of truth and
          passion for accurate historical knowledge. Being wonderfully
          gifted and highly trained, he set forth upon a career of learned
          acquisition which made him the admiration of his associates. But
          in his own communion he soon became unpopular because he was a
          pronounced liberal. He conducted the "Home and Foreign Review"
          from 1862 to 1864 in the interest of anti-Ultramontanism, and so
          was condemned by the hierarchy and his journal virtually
          suppressed. He then pursued the same course in the "North
          British Review" from 1868 to 1872. His chief object of attack
          was the doctrine of papal infallibility, and he did all he could
          to prevent its adoption, but when it was promulgated by the
          Vatican Council of 1870 he did not follow his preceptor and
          friend Döllinger into the ranks of the Old Catholics, but
          remained in the Roman obedience. He showed that he had neither
          altered his views nor would he give up his independence when in
          1874 he criticized with learning and candor the views of his
          patron and friend Gladstone upon Vaticanism. From 1859 to 1864
          he represented Carlow in Parliament. In 1869 Mr. Gladstone
          raised him to the peerage. In 1886 he founded "The English
          Historical Review" with Professor (afterward Bishop) Mandell
          Creighton as editor. In 1895 he was made regius professor of
          modern history at Cambridge. He planned the Cambridge Modern
          History series, but did not live to see any of it published.

          Lord Acton possessed vast stores of accurate information, but he
          wrote very little except review articles and book-notices. So
          his list of separate publications is singularly short for so
          great a scholar. He edited Les Matinées royales, ou l'art de
          regner, the work of Frederick the Great (London, 1863); made a
          great sensation by his Sendschreiben an einem deutschen Bischof
          des vaticanischen Concils (Nördlingen, 1870); by his Zur
          Geschichte des vaticanischen Concils (Munich, 1871); and by his
          letters as correspondent of the London "Times" during the
          Council. His lectures, The War of 1870 (London, 1871), and
          especially those masterly ones on The History of Freedom in
          Antiquity and on The History of Freedom in Christianity (both
          Bridgnorth, 1877), fragments of that complete history of freedom
          which he dreamed he should one day write, and finally his
          inaugural lecture at Cambridge on The Study of History (London,
          1895), show his range of knowledge and love of truth. Since his
          death his Letters to Mary [now Mrs. Drew], Daughter of the Right
          Honorable W. E. Gladstone (1904), edited with a memoir by
          Herbert Paul, his Cambridge Lectures (1906), and Lectures on
          Modern History (1906) have been published.

   Adalbert (Adelbert, Aldebert)
          ADALBERT (ADELBERT, ALDEBERT): Frankish bishop; contemporary of
          [66]Boniface. He is known only from the letters of Boniface, who
          was his bitter opponent, and from the accounts of the
          proceedings instituted against him for heresy, which represent
          him as a dangerous misleader of the people, a skilful impostor,
          and arrogant blockhead, who thought himself equal to the
          apostles, declared himself canonized before birth, and claimed
          the power of working miracles and of remitting sins. It is said
          that he pretended to have a letter from Jesus, which the
          archangel Michael had found in Jerusalem, and other relics
          brought to him by angels. He disregarded confession, not
          thinking it necessary for the remission of sins, and planted
          crosses and founded chapels on the hills and by the streams,
          inducing the people to come thither for service instead of going
          to the churches of the apostles and martyrs. In his prayers
          unknown and suspicious names of angels were found. At the
          instigation of Boniface two Frankish synods (744 and 745)
          deposed Adalbert and condemned him to penance as a "servant and
          forerunner of Antichrist." A Roman synod confirmed his sentence
          and added excommunication. In 747 a general Frankish synod
          received a command from the pope to apprehend Adalbert and send
          him to Rome. The major domus, Pepin, burned his crosses and
          chapels; but the people seem to have sympathized with their
          bishop, who did not acknowledge the authority of his judges and
          who was not allowed to defend himself. His fate is unknown.
          Mainz tradition relates that he was defeated in a discussion
          with Boniface, that he was imprisoned at Fulda, and was killed
          by a swineherd while trying to escape. Opinions concerning him
          differ. Some look upon him as mentally unsound, as an impostor,
          or as a fanatic. Others see in him, as in his countryman
          [67]Clement among the East Franks, freedom from Rome, an
          opponent of the romanizing tendencies of his time, and a victim
          of the ecclesiastical policy of Boniface.

   Adalbert of Hamburg-Bremen
          ADALBERT OF HAMBURG-BREMEN (formerly often called Albert):
          Archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen 1045 (1043 ?)-1072; d. at Goslar
          Mar. 16, 1072. He came of a noble Saxon-Thuringian family, is
          first heard of as canon of Halberstadt, and followed the head of
          his chapter, Hermann, to Bremen when the latter was made
          archbishop, in 1032; on Hermann's death, three years later, he
          returned to Halberstadt and became provost there himself. He is
          probably the Adalbert who early in 1045 was acting as chancellor
          for Henry III. in Italian affairs. Henry nominated him to the
          archbishopric of Hamburg, probably in 1045, though some recent
          historians have placed the date at 1043. He soon showed that he
          had a lofty conception of the dignity of his office; and his
          ambition was supported by many advantages--a handsome and
          imposing presence, intellectual force, and the reputation of
          singular personal purity and moderation at a time when such
          qualities were rare. The reign of Henry III. was the period of
          his success and domination. King and archbishop, endowed with
          similar gifts, were attracted to each other, and found it
          necessary to make common cause against the Saxon dukes of the
          Billung house, who had already troubled the Church of Hamburg.
          Adalbert's frequent absences from his diocese gave the Billungs
          opportunity to attack it; but the archbishop, often accompanied
          by his vassals, could not avoid spending considerable time on
          the king's business. He accompanied Henry on his campaign of
          1045, and went to Rome with him in the next year, taking part in
          the synods which deposed the three rival claimants for the papal
          see ([68]Benedict IX., [69]Sylvester III., and [70]Gregory VI.).
          Henry was minded to make him pope, but he firmly declined, and
          suggested the candidate on whom the choice finally fell,
          Suidger, bishop of Bamberg (see [71]Clement II.).

          Adalbert returned with Henry in May, 1047, and devoted himself
          to diocesan affairs. In the territories of the Abodrites
          (Obotrites) Gottschalk had gained supreme power, and worked with
          Adalbert for the introduction of Christianity (see
          [72]Gottschalk, 2). Norway, Sweden, and Denmark had all
          recognized the spiritual jurisdiction of Hamburg; but an effort
          was now made to break away from it. Svend Estridsen, king of
          Denmark after 1047, made an alliance with Henry through
          Adalbert's mediation, and brought forward a plan for the
          establishment of a separate ecclesiastical province in Denmark,
          with an archbishop and seven suffragans. Adalbert naturally
          could not look with complacency on the withdrawal of so large a
          part of his jurisdiction, after the sacrifices which the Church
          of Hamburg had made in the previous two hundred years for the
          evangelization of the northern kingdoms; and he feared that
          Sweden and Norway would follow. Yet he could not deny that there
          was some justification for Svend's desire. The emperor and Pope
          Leo IX., who took part in the Council of Mainz in 1049, seemed
          not indisposed to grant it. Adalbert offered to consent, on
          condition that he should have the rank of patriarch for the
          whole north. This, he thought, would solve the difficulty; one
          archbishop could not be subject to another, but might be to a
          patriarch. The project grew on him; and he planned the
          establishment of eleven new German sees to serve as a basis for
          his dignity. He did not contemplate any immediate rejection of
          Rome's suzerainty; but it was obvious that his plan might easily
          give him a position in the north not far short of that which the
          pope held in the south. Leo died in 1054, and Henry in 1056; and
          further thought of so far-reaching a scheme had to be postponed.

          Deprived of Henry's, support, Adalbert suffered much at the
          hands of the Billung dukes. Henry's son and successor (but five
          years old at his father's death) in 1062 fell into the power of
          [73]Anno, archbishop of Cologne; but the latter was soon forced
          to share his power with Adalbert, and then to see it passing
          more and more into his rival's hands. Of the two, Adalbert had
          much the better influence on the young king. He reached the
          height of his power when he had the king proclaimed of age at
          Worms (Mar. 29, 1065), and practically held the government in
          his own hands. But in Jan., 1066, the princes, with Anno at
          their head, forced Henry to banish Adalbert from court; and his
          remaining years were clouded by many troubles. New assaults of
          the Billungs forced him to flee from Hamburg. Paganism once more
          got the upper hand among the Wends, who laid waste the
          neighboring Christian lands; in Sweden the Church had to fight
          for its very existence. He was recalled to court in 1069, but
          did not succeed in restoring the prestige of his position. He
          still worked for the consolidation of the royal power in
          Germany, but had to leave the Saxon problem behind him unsolved.
          He bore long physical sufferings with remarkable firmness,
          laboring to the last for the king and for his diocese. He wished
          to be buried at Hamburg; but the destruction of that city by the
          Wends prevented this; and his body was laid in the cathedral of
          Bremen, the rebuilding of which he had himself completed.

   Adalbert of Prague
          ADALBERT OF PRAGUE (Czech, Woitech, "Comfort of the Army"): An
          early German missionary, sometimes improperly called "the
          Apostle of the Slavs" or "of the Prussians"; b. about 950;
          murdered Apr. 23, 997. He was the son of a rich Czech nobleman
          named Slavenik, connected with the royal house of Saxony. He was
          educated at Magdeburg, but on the death of Adalbert (981), first
          archbishop of that place, whose name he had taken at
          confirmation, he returned home and was ordained priest by
          Thietmar, the first bishop of Prague, whom he succeeded two
          years later. He received investiture at Verona from Emperor Otho
          II., his kinsman, and was consecrated by Willigis, archbishop of
          Mainz, his metropolitan. His troubles soon began. The attempt to
          execute strictly what he conceived to be his episcopal duties
          brought him into conflict with his countrymen, who were hard to
          wean from their heathen customs. After five years of struggle,
          he left his diocese, intending to make a pilgrimage to
          Jerusalem; but after a sojourn at Monte Cassino, he entered the
          monastery of St. Boniface at Rome, where he led a singularly
          devoted and ascetic life. In 992, however, he was required by
          the pope and his metropolitan to return to Prague. The conflict
          with stubbornly persistent heathen customs--polygamy,
          witchcraft, slavery--proved as hard as ever, and he once more
          left his diocese, returning, after a missionary tour in Hungary,
          to the peaceful seclusion of his Roman cloister.

          In 996 Willigis visited Rome and obtained fresh orders for
          Adelbert to return to his see, with permission to go and preach
          to the heathen only in case his flock should absolutely refuse
          to receive him. He went north in company with the young emperor,
          Otho III., and in the next spring, through Poland, approached
          Bohemia. Things had grown worse than ever there: his family had
          fallen under suspicion of treason through their connections with
          Germany and Poland; and the greater part of them had been put to
          death. His offer to return to Prague having been contumeliously
          rejected, he felt himself free to turn to the work which he
          desired among the heathen Prussians. Here he was killed by a
          pagan priest before he had succeeded in accomplishing much. His
          body was brought by the Duke of Poland and buried at Gnesen,
          whence it was taken to Prague in 1039.

   Adalbold
          ADALBOLD, ad´?l-bOld: Bishop of Utrecht; d. Nov. 27, 1026. He
          was born probably in the Low Countries, and received his
          education partly from Notker of Liége. He became a canon of
          Laubach, and apparently was a teacher there. The emperor Henry
          II., who had a great regard for him, invited him to the court,
          and nominated him as Bishop of Utrecht (1010), and he must be
          regarded as the principal founder of the territorial possessions
          of the diocese, especially by the acquisition in 1024 and 1026
          of the counties of Thrente and Teisterbant. He was obliged to
          defend his bishopric not only against frequent inroads by the
          Normans, but also against the aggressions of neighboring nobles.
          He was unsuccessful in the attempt to vindicate the possession
          of the district of Merwede (Mircvidu), between the mouths of the
          Maas and the Waal, against Dietrich III. of Holland. The
          imperial award required the restitution of this territory to the
          bishop and the destruction of a castle which Dietrich had built
          to control the navigation of the Maas; but the expedition under
          Godfrey of Brabant which undertook to enforce this decision was
          defeated; and in the subsequent agreement the disputed land
          remained in Dietrich's possession. Adalbold was active in
          promoting the building of churches and monasteries in his
          diocese. His principal achievement of this kind was the
          completion within a few years of the great cathedral of St.
          Martin at Utrecht. He restored the monastery of Thiel, and
          completed that of Hohorst, begun by his predecessor Ansfried. To
          the charge of the latter he appointed Poppo of Stablo, and thus
          introduced the Cluniac reform into the diocese.

          Adalbold is also to be mentioned as an author. A life of Henry
          II., carried down to 1012, has been ascribed to him; but the
          evidence in favor of attributing to him the extant fragment of
          such a life (MGH, Script., iv., 1841, 679-695; MPL, cxl. 87-108)
          is not decisive. He wrote a mathematical treatise upon squaring
          the circle (MPL, cxl. 1103-08), and dedicated it to Pope
          Sylvester II., who was himself a noted mathematician. There is
          also extant a philosophical exposition of a passage of Boethius
          (ed. W. Moll in Kerkhistorisch Archief, iii., Amsterdam, 1862,
          pp. 198-213). The discussion Quemadmodum indubitanter musicæ
          consonantiæ judicari possint (ed. M. Gerbert, in Scriptores
          ecclesiastici de musica sacra, i., St. Blasien, 1784, pp.
          303-312; MPL, cxl. 1109) seems to have been ascribed to him on
          insufficient grounds.

   Adaldag
          ADALDAG, ad´?l-d??g: Seventh archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen
          (937-988); d. at Bremen Apr. 28 or 29, 988. He was of noble
          birth, a relation and pupil of Bishop Adalward of Verden and
          became canon of Hildesheim. Otho I. made him his chancellor and
          notary immediately after his accession, and on the death of
          Archbishop Unni of Hamburg-Bremen (936) nominated him to the
          vacant see. None of the early incumbents of the see ruled so
          long a time; and none did so much for the diocese, though his
          success was partly the fruit of his predecessors' labors and of
          peculiarly favorable circumstances. Under Adaldag the
          metropolitan see obtained its first suffragans, by the erection
          of the bishoprics of Ripen, Sleswick, and Aarhus; and that of
          Aldenburg was also placed under Hamburg, though the Slavic
          territories of the present Oldenburg had formerly belonged to
          the diocese of Verden. He resisted successfully a renewal of the
          efforts of Cologne to claim jurisdiction over Bremen (see
          [74]Adalgar). He gained many privileges for his see, in
          jurisdiction, possession of land, and market rights, by his
          close relations with the emperors, especially Otho I. He
          accompanied the latter on his journey to Rome, and remained with
          him from 961 to 965, and is mentioned as the emperor's chief
          counselor at the time of his coronation in Rome. Otho placed the
          deposed pope Benedict V. in his custody. After Adaldag's return
          to Hamburg, he still maintained these relations, and his
          privileges were confirmed by Otho II. and by the regency of Otho
          III. The later years of his life were troubled by inroads of the
          Danes and Slavonians on the north, and he may have witnessed the
          sack of Hamburg by the latter under Mistiwoi (if its date, as
          Usinger and Dehio think, was 983).

   Adalgar
          ADALGAR, ad´?l-g??r: Third archbishop of Hamburg-Bremen
          (888-909); d. May 9, 909. When Rimbert, who was appointed in 865
          to succeed Ansgar, the first archbishop of Hamburg, stopped at
          the abbey of Corvey on his way to his field of labor, the abbot
          Adalgar gave him his brother, also named Adalgar, as a
          companion. The younger Adalgar was then a deacon. Toward the end
          of Rimbert's life he was consecrated bishop to assist the
          latter; and he succeeded him in the archbishopric (June 11,
          888). During the latter half of his twenty years' rule, age and
          infirmity made it necessary for him also to have a coadjutor in
          the person of Hoger, another monk of Corvey; and later five
          neighboring bishops were charged to assist the archbishop in his
          metropolitan duties.

          Adalgar lived in troublous times. Although Arnulf's victory over
          the Normans (891) was a relief to his diocese, and although
          under Louis the Child (900-911) it suffered less from Hungarian
          onslaughts than the districts to the south and east of it, yet
          the general confusion restricted Adalgar's activity, and he was
          able to do very little in the northern kingdoms which were
          supposed to be part of his mission. There were also new contests
          over the relation of Bremen to the archiepiscopal see of
          Cologne. Bremen had originally been under the jurisdiction of
          Cologne; but this relation was dissolved on the reestablishment
          of the archbishopric of Hamburg in 848; and Pope Nicholas I. had
          confirmed the subordination of Bremen to Hamburg in 864 (see
          [75]Ansgar; [76]Hamburg, Archbishopric of ). In 890 Archbishop
          Hermann of Cologne wrote to Pope Stephen VI., demanding that the
          archbishop of Hamburg, as bishop of Bremen be subject to him.
          The course of the controversy is somewhat obscure; but it is
          known that Stephen cited both contestants to Rome, and when
          Adalgar alone appeared, Hermann being represented by delegates
          with unsatisfactory credentials, the pope referred the matter to
          Archbishop Fulk of Reims, to decide in a synod at Worms. In the
          mean time Stephen died; and his successor Formosus placed the
          investigation in the hands of a synod which met at Frankfort in
          892 under Hatto of Mainz. On the basis of its report, Formosus
          decided that Bremen should be united to Hamburg so long as the
          latter had no suffragan sees, but should revert to Cologne when
          any were erected, the archbishop of Hamburg meanwhile taking
          part in the provincial synods of Cologne, without thereby
          admitting his subordination. Little is known of Adalgar's
          personality. From the way in which Rimbert's biographer and Adam
          of Bremen speak of him, he seems to have been a man of some
          force, but perhaps not strong enough for the difficult times in
          which his activity was cast.

   Adalhard and Wala
          ADALHARD AND WALA, ad´?l-h??rd, w??´l?: Abbots of Corbie (10 m.
          e. of Amiens) from about 775 to 834. They were brothers, cousins
          of Charlemagne, pupils and friends of Alcuin and Paul the
          Deacon, and men of much authority and influence in both church
          and state. The elder, Adalhard (b. about 751; d. Jan. 2, 826),
          was interested in the German language and the education of the
          clergy, and is especially famous for the establishment of
          diocesan colleges and the foundation of the abbey of New Corbie
          (Corvey) on the Weser (see [77]Corvey). He gave new laws to his
          monastery of Corbie (MPL, cv. 535-550), and defended against
          Pope Leo III. the resolutions de exitu Spiritus Sancti passed in
          the autumn of 809 by the Synod of Aachen (see [78]Filioque
          Controversy). When Charlemagne's son Pepin, king of Italy, died
          (810), Adalhard was appointed counselor of his young son Bernard
          in the government of Italy.

          The younger brother, Wala (d. at Bobbio in Italy Sept. 12, 836),
          also enjoyed the confidence of Charlemagne, and became chief of
          the counts of Saxony. In 812 he was sent to join Adalhard and
          Bernard in Italy and work for the choice of the last-named as
          king of the Lombards. After the death of Charlemagne and the
          accession of the incapable Louis (814), whom the brothers had
          always opposed, they returned to Corbie, and fell into disgrace
          for having favored Bernard. They were deprived of their estates
          and Adalhard was banished. After seven years, however, a
          reconciliation took place between them and Louis. Wala, as
          successor of Adalhard at Corbie, continued his brother's work
          and gave especial care to the mission in the north. As head of
          the opposition to the repeal of the law of succession of 817 and
          a bold defender of the rights of the Church, he was imprisoned
          by Louis in 830, and regained his liberty only when, in 833,
          Louis's eldest son, Lothair, the future emperor, came north with
          an army, accompanied by Pope Gregory IV. Wala's counsel was
          gratefully received by both Lothair and Gregory; and the former
          rewarded him with the abbey of Bobbio in northern Italy. Just
          before his death Wala became reconciled with Louis, and, at the
          head of an embassy sent to that monarch by Lothair, made peace
          between father and son.

I. Doctrinal:

  1. The Biblical Statement Interpreted Literally.

          According to the literal statement of Genesis (v. 2), the name
          "Adam" (Heb. adham, "man") was given by God himself to the first
          human being. The important place occupied by man, according to
          the Biblical idea, is the close, the appointed climax, of
          creation. Inanimate nature looked forward to man. To his
          creation God gave special care. It was sufficient for the
          Creator to order the other creatures into being; but man was
          molded by the divine fingers out of the dust of the earth. Thus
          far he belonged to the created world; but into him God breathed
          the breath of life, and thus put him in an immeasurably higher
          place; for the possession of this breath made him the "image" of
          God. What this "image" was is learned from the Bible (Gen. i.
          26, ii. 7); it was likeness to God in the government of the
          creatures and in the possession of the same spirit (see
          [79]Image of God). God, the absolute personality, reflects
          himself in man and, therefore, the latter becomes the lord of
          creation. Adam was the representative of the race--humanity in
          person. Opposite to the species and genera of beasts stood the
          single man. He was not a male, still less a man-woman; he was
          man. Out of him, as the progenitor of the race, Eve was taken.

          But man's true position can not be comprehended until he is
          considered in relation to Christ, the second man, as is most
          clearly expressed in Rom. v. 12 sqq.; I Cor. xv. 21-22, 45-49.
          By Adam's fall, sin and death entered into the world, and
          condemnation has come upon all through him; but from the second
          Adam has come just the opposite--righteousness, justification,
          and life. Those who by sin are united to the first Adam reap all
          the consequences of such a union; similarly do those who by
          faith are united to the second Adam. Each is a representative
          head.

  2. The Position of Adam to the Race.

          Materialism sees in man a mere product of nature. It is
          difficult to see how it makes place for self-consciousness. The
          unity of the race is also given up; and so logically Darwinism
          leads to belief in a plurality of race origins. Theology, on the
          other hand, holds fast to the personality of man, but has, from
          the beginning of the science, wavered in regard to the position
          occupied by Adam toward the race. The oldest Greek Fathers are
          silent upon this point. Irenæus is the first to touch it; and he
          maintains that the first sin was the sin of the race, since Adam
          was its head (III. xxiii. 3; V. xii. 3; cf. R. Seeberg,
          Dogmengeschichte, i., Leipsic, 1895, p. 82). Origen, on the
          other hand, holds that man sinned because he had abused his
          liberty when in a preexistent state. In Adam seminally were the
          bodies of all his descendants (Contra Celsum, iv.; cf. C. F. A.
          Kahnis, Dogmatik, ii., Leipsic, 1864, pp. 107 sqq.). Gregory
          Nazianzen, Gregory of Nyssa, and Chrysostom derive sin from the
          fall. Tertullian, Cyprian, Hilary, Ambrose, and Augustine
          represent the Biblical standpoint. Pelagius saw in Adam only a
          bad example, which his descendants followed. Semi-Pelagianism
          similarly regarded the first sin merely as opening the
          flood-gates to iniquity; but upon this point Augustinianism
          since it was formulated has dominated the Church--in Adam the
          race sinned.

          (Carl von Buchrucker.)

  3. The Orthodox Views.

          The prominent orthodox views are: (1) The Augustinian, known as
          realism, which is that human nature in its entirety was in Adam
          when he sinned, that his sin was the act of human nature, and
          that in this sin human nature fell; that is, lost its freedom to
          the good, becoming wholly sinful and producing sinners. "We
          sinned in that man when we were that man." This is the view of
          Anselm, Peter Lombard, Thomas Aquinas, and Luther. (2) The
          federal theory of the Dutch divines Cocceius and Witsius is that
          Adam became the representative of mankind and that the probation
          of the human race ended once for all in his trial and fall in
          the garden of Eden. Accordingly the guilt of Adam's sin was
          imputed to his posterity. This is the theory of Turretin and the
          Princeton theologians. (3) The theory of mediate imputation
          (Placæus) is that the sin of Adam is imputed to his descendants
          not directly, but on account of their depravity derived from him
          and their consent to his sin. (See [80]Imputation; [81]Sin.)

  4. The Evolutionary Views.

          According to the evolutionary view of man's origin, which is not
          necessarily materialistic, Adam may be designated as the first
          individual or individuals in the upward process of development
          in whom self-consciousness appeared or who attained such
          stability of life that henceforth humanity was able to survive
          the shock of death. By some, the first man is conceived of as a
          special instance of creative wisdom and power; by others, as the
          natural result of the evolutionary process. Whether the human
          race sprang from one individual or from several is, for lack of
          evidence, left an open question. In this position the unity of
          the race is in no wise compromised, since this is grounded not
          in derivation from a single pair but in identity of constitution
          and ideal ethical and spiritual aim. This view of the first man
          brings into prominence the dignity of human nature and its
          kinship with the divine, yet at the same time profoundly
          modifies the traditional doctrine of original sin. In the
          disproportion between the inherited instincts, appetites, and
          desires of the animal nature and the weak and struggling
          impulses of the moral consciousness there arises an inevitable
          conflict in which the higher is temporarily worsted and the
          sense of sin emerges. By virtue of heredity and the organic and
          social unity of the race, all the descendants of the earliest
          man are involved with him in the common struggle, the defeat,
          and the victory of the moral and spiritual life. This conflict
          is a sign that man is not simply a fallen being, but is in
          process of ascent. The first man, although of the earth, is a
          silent prophecy of the second man, the Lord from heaven.

          C. A. Beckwith.

II. Historical:

  1. The Use of "Adam" as a Proper Name.

          The sources of knowledge of Adam are exclusively Biblical and,
          indeed, wholly of the Old Testament, since the New Testament
          adds nothing concerning his personality and his doings to what
          is recorded of him in the Book of Genesis. The main inquiry,
          therefore, must be as to the place occupied by Adam in the Old
          Testament. Here several striking facts confront us: (1) There is
          no allusion to Adam direct or indirect after the early
          genealogies. In Deut. xxxii. 8 and Job xxviii. 28 the Hebrew
          adham (adam) means "mankind." In Hos. vi. 7 the reading should
          be "Admah" (a place-name). The latest references (apart from the
          excerpt in I Chron. i. 1) are Gen. iv. 25 (Sethite line of J)
          and Gen. v. 1, 3 (Sethite line of P). (2) Outside of the
          genealogies there is no clear instance of the use of the word as
          a proper name. The definite article, omitted in the Masoretic
          text, should be restored in Gen. iii. 17, 21 (J) in harmony with
          the usage of the whole context, which reads "the man" instead of
          "Adam." Eve (Gen. iii. 20; iv. 1) is the first proper name of
          our Bible. (3) Whatever may have been the origin of the proper
          name "Adam," its use here seems to be derived from and based
          upon the original generic sense. Even in the genealogies the two
          significations are interchanges. Thus while Gen. v. 1
          substitutes "Adam" for "the man" of i. 27, chap. v. 2 continues:
          "Male and female created he them . . . and called their name
          Adam." It is a fair inference that the genealogies are in part
          at least responsible for the individual and personal usage of
          the name. When it is considered that all Semitic history began
          with genealogies, of which the standing designation in the early
          summaries is "generations" (Heb. toledhoth), the general motive
          of such a transference of ideas is obvious. The process was easy
          and natural because in the ancient type of society a community
          is thought of as a unit, is a proper name without the article,
          and is designated by a single not a plural form. The first
          community having been "man" ("the adam"), its head and
          representative was naturally spoken of as "Man" ("Adam") when
          there was need of referring to him. On the etymological side a
          partial illustration is afforded by the French on (Lat. homo)
          and the German man, which express individualization anonymously.

  2. Foreign Influence in P.

          The secondary character of the notion of an individual Adam is
          also made probable by the fact that the genealogical system of P
          is artificial and of foreign origin or at least of foreign
          suggestion. The whole scheme of the ten generations of Gen. v.
          is modeled upon and in part borrowed from the Babylonian
          tradition of the first ten kings of Babylon. Of these lists of
          ten there are five names in either list which show striking
          correspondences with five in the other, ending with the tenth,
          which in either case is the name of the hero of the flood story.
          These Babylonian kings also were demigods, having lives of
          immense duration, two of them, moreover (the seventh and the
          tenth), having, like Enoch and Noah, special communications with
          divinity.

  3. The Aim and Plan of P.

          In brief, as regards P, the matter stands as follows:--His first
          theme was the process and plan of creation according to an
          ascending scale of being. At the head of creation were put the
          first human beings, "man" or mankind (Gen. i. 26). The second
          leading thought in P's "generations of the heavens and the
          earth" was the continuance of the race or the peopling of the
          earth. Expression was given to it by the statement that "the
          man" was created "male and female" (i. 27). The third stage in
          the narrative is reached when the descent of Abraham from the
          first man is established, in order to provide a necessary and
          appropriate pedigree for the house of Israel. At the head of
          this line was placed the individual "Man" or "Adam."

  4. The Narrative of J.

          Turning now to the story of Paradise and the Fall, which, as has
          been seen, speaks of the first man only as "the man" and not as
          "Adam," the main motive of Gen. ii.-iv. is to account for
          certain characteristics and habits of mankind, above all to set
          forth the origin, nature, and consequences of sin as
          disobedience to and alienation from Yahweh. Man is presented
          first as a single individual; next as being mated with a woman,
          with and for whom he has a divinely constituted affinity; then
          as the head of the race upon which he brings the curse due to
          his own disobedience. At first sight this might seem to imply a
          preconception of the individuality and personality of the first
          man, who may as well as not have borne the name "Adam," which J
          himself gives him in the fragmentary genealogy of Gen. iv.
          25-26. But the inference is not justified. The pictures drawn by
          J and the conceptions they embody are not spontaneous effusions.
          They are the result of careful selection and of long and
          profound reflection, and when the problems which J sets out to
          solve and the incidents which convey and embody the solution be
          considered, it must be concluded that the answers to the
          questions could have been arrived at only through the study of
          man, not in individuals but as a social being. In other words,
          this "prophetic" interpreter worked his way backward through
          history or tradition along certain well-known lines of general
          human experience, and at the heart of the story appears not a
          single but a composite figure, not an individual but a type,
          while the story itself is not history or biography but in part
          mythical and in part allegorical. Thus the unhistorical
          character of Adam is even more demonstrable from the narrative
          of J than from that of P.

  5. Parallels in Other Literatures.

          Some of the primitive mythical material in Genesis has analogies
          in other literatures. Not to mention the more remote Avesta,
          attention must again be called to some of the Babylonian
          parallels. It is now indisputable that Eden is a Babylonian
          name; that the whole scenery of the region is Babylonian; that
          the tree of life, the cherubim, and the serpent, the enemy of
          the gods and men, are all Babylonian. There is also the
          Babylonian story of how the first man came to forfeit
          immortality. Adapa, the human son of the good god Ea, had
          offended Anu, the god of heaven (see [82]Babylonia, VII, 3,
          § 3), and was summoned to heaven to answer for his offense.
          Before his journey thither he was warned by his divine father to
          refuse the "food of death" and "water of death" which Anu would
          offer to him. At the trial, Anu, who had been moved by the
          intercession of two lesser gods, offered him instead "food of
          life" and "water of life." These he refused, and thus missed the
          immortality intended for him; for Anu when placated had wished
          to place him among the gods. Some such story as this by a
          process of reduction along monotheistic lines may have
          contributed its part to the framework of the narrative of the
          rejection of Adam. It is indeed possible that Adam and Adapa are
          ultimately the same name.

  6. The Literary Material Mythical in Character.

          An important element in the whole case is the general character
          of the literary material of which the story of Adam forms a
          portion. Apart from the conceptions proper to the religion of
          Israel, which give them their distinctive moral value, the
          events and incidents related belong generically to the mythical
          stories of the beginnings of the earth and man, which have been
          related among many ancient and modern peoples, and specifically
          to the cycle of myths and legends which reached their fullest
          literary development in Babylonia, and which undoubtedly were
          originally the outgrowth of a polytheistic theory of the origin
          of the universe. Much weight must also be attached to the fact
          that the story of Adam is practically isolated in the Old
          Testament, above all to the consideration that prophecy and
          psalmody, which build so much upon actual history, ignore it
          altogether.

  7. New Testament References.

          The New Testament references show that Jesus and Paul used the
          earliest stories of Genesis for didactic purposes. The remark is
          often made in explanation that their age was not a critical one
          and that the sacred authors did not in their own minds question
          the current belief in the accuracy of the oldest documents. This
          is probably true, at any rate of Paul (cf. especially I Cor. xi.
          8-9; I Tim. ii. 13-14). His view of the relation between the
          first and second Adam (I Cor. xv. 22, 45; Rom. v. 12 sqq.) is
          the development of an idea of rabbinical theology, and has a
          curious primitive analogy in the relation between Merodach, the
          divine son of the good god Ea, and Adapa, the human son of Ea
          (cf. Luke iii. 38). Jesus himself does not make any direct
          reference to Adam in his recorded sayings.

   Adam of Bremen
          ADAM OF BREMEN: Author of the Gesta Hammenburgensis ecclesiæ
          pontificum, a history of the archbishops of Hamburg-Bremen
          extending down to the death of Adalbert (1072). The work itself
          tells of its author only that his name began with "A," that he
          came to Bremen in 1068 and ultimately became a canon there, and
          that he wrote the book between the death of Adalbert and that of
          King Svend Estridsen of Denmark (1072-76). But there is no doubt
          that this is the work referred to by Helmold and assigned to a
          Magister Adam; in which case the author must be the Adam
          magister scholarum who wrote and was one of the signatories to
          an extant document of Jan. 11, 1069, and also the same whose
          death on Oct. 12, year not given, is recorded in a Bremen
          register.

          It may be conjectured from scanty indications that Adam was born
          in upper Saxony and educated at Magdeburg. His education was in
          any case a thorough one for his time. His book is one of the
          best historical works of the Middle Ages. Not only is it the
          principal source for the early history of the archbishopric and
          its northern missions, but it gives many valuable data both for
          Germany and other countries. The author was unusually well
          provided with documents and with the qualities necessary for
          their use. His general credibility and love of truth have never
          been seriously challenged; and his impartiality is shown by the
          way in which he records the weaknesses of Adalbert, with whom he
          was in close relations and whom he admired. The best edition of
          Adam's book is by J. M. Lappenberg, in MGH, Script., vii. (1846)
          267-389 (issued separately, Hanover, 1846; 2d ed., with full
          introduction and notes, 1876); the work is also in MPL, cxlvi.
          451-620. There is a German translation by J. C. M. Laurent (2d
          ed., revised by W. Wattenbach, Leipsic, 1888).

          where he was rector of the city school, Mar. 23, 1622. He is
          remembered for his series of 136 biographies, mostly of German
          Protestant scholars, especially theologians (5 vols., Heidelberg
          and Frankfort, 1615-20; 2d ed., under the title Dignorum laude
          virorum immortalitas, 1653; 3d ed., 1706).

   Adam of Saint Victor
          ADAM OF SAINT VICTOR: One of the most important of the
          liturgical poets of the Middle Ages; his nationality is
          described by the Latin word Brito ("Breton" ?), and he was canon
          of St. Victor of Paris in the second half of the twelfth
          century. From his sequence upon Thomas Becket of Canterbury it
          is inferred that he survived the latter's canonization (1174).
          His poems do not include all of his writings, but are the most
          important. From the ninth century it was customary to set words
          (called prosa and sequentia) to the melodies (jubili, sequentia)
          with which the Hallelujah of the gradual in the mass closed (see
          [84]Sequence). In the twelfth century a more artificial style of
          composition, according to strict rules, took the place of the
          freer rhythms of the earlier time, and for this period of
          sequence composition Adam has an importance comparable to that
          of [85]Notker for the former period. He shows a real talent in
          his mastery of form; and his best pieces contain true poetry,
          although as concerns power to excite the emotions and the higher
          flights of the poetic fancy, his compositions are not equal to a
          Salve caput, Stabat mater, or Lauda Sion.

   Adam the Scotchman
          ADAM THE SCOTCHMAN (Adamus Scotus, called also Adamus Anglicus):
          A mystic-ascetic author of the twelfth century. According to his
          biographer, the Premonstrant Godefroi Ghiselbert of the
          seventeenth century, he was of north-English origin, belonged to
          the Premonstrant order, was abbot at Whithorn (Casa Candida) in
          Galloway toward 1180, and about the same time also lived
          temporarily at Prémontré, the French parent monastery of the
          order. He seems to have died soon after. It is highly improbable
          that he was living in the thirteenth century, as Ghiselbert
          thinks, who identifies him with the English bishop of the Order
          of St. Norbert mentioned by Cæsarius of Heisterbach
          (Miraculorum, iii. 22). The first incomplete edition of Adam's
          works was published by Ægidius Gourmont (Paris, 1518). It
          contains his three principal writings of mystic-monastic
          content: (1) Liber de ordine, habitu, et professione
          Præmonstratensium, fourteen sermons; (2) De tripartito
          tabernaculo; (3) De triplici genere contemplationis. The edition
          of Petrus Bellerus (Antwerp, 1659) contains also Ghiselbert's
          life and a collection of forty-seven sermons on the festivals of
          the church year, which seem to have belonged to a larger
          collection of 100 sermons comprising the whole church year. In
          1721 Bernhard Pez (Thesaurus anecdotorum, i. 2, 335 sqq.)
          published Soliloquia de instructione discipuli, sive de
          instructione animæ, which has been ascribed to Adam of St.
          Victor, but belongs probably to Adam the Scotchman. All of these
          works with Ghiselbert's life are in MPL, cxcviii. 9-872.

   Adamites (Adamiani)
          ADAMITES (ADAMIANI): 1. Epiphanius (Hær., lii.) gives an account
          of a sect of "Adamiani," that held their religious assemblies in
          subterranean chambers, both men and women appearing in a state
          of nature to imitate Adam and Eve, and calling their meetings
          paradise. Since Epiphanius knew of them only from hearsay, and
          is himself doubtful whether to make of them a special class of
          heretics, their existence must be regarded as questionable.
          There are further unverifiable notices in John of Damascus
          (Opera, i. 88; following the Anakephalaiosis, attributed to
          Epiphanius), in Augustine (Hær., lxxxi.), and in Hæreticarum
          fabularum epitome, i. 6).

          G. Krüger.

          2. Charges of community of women, ritual child-murder, and
          nocturnal orgies were brought by the heathen world against the
          early Christians, and by the latter against various sects of
          their own number (Montanists, Manicheans, Priscillianists,
          etc.). Similar accusations were made against almost all medieval
          sects, notably the Cathari, the Waldensians, the Italian
          Fraticelli, the heretical flagellants of Thuringia in 1454, and
          the Brethren of the Free Spirit. All of these allegations are to
          be regarded with much suspicion. The doctrine of a sinless
          state, taught by the Brethren of the Free Spirit, and, in other
          cases, extravagant acts of overwrought mystics may have
          furnished a basis, which, without doubt, was often elaborated
          from the accounts of "Adamites" mentioned above.

          3. The name "Adamites" has become the permanent designation of a
          sect of Bohemian Taborites, who, in Mar., 1421, established
          themselves on an island in the Luschnitz, near Neuhaus, and are
          said to have indulged in predatory forays upon the neighborhood,
          and to have committed wild excesses in nocturnal dances. They
          were suppressed by Ziska and Ulrich von Neuhaus in Oct., 1421.
          It is probable that they were merely a faction of the Taborites
          who carried to an extreme their belief in the necessity of a
          complete separation from the Church and resorted to violence to
          spread their principles. The charges against their moral
          character are in the highest degree suspicious. Even in the
          eighteenth and nineteenth centuries certain religious sectaries
          were persecuted in Bohemia as "Adamites."

          4. An Anabaptist sect in the Netherlands about 1580 received the
          name "Adamites" because they required candidates for admission
          to appear unclothed before the congregation and thus show that
          physical desire had no power over them. Members of an Amsterdam
          congregation who in 1535 ran through the streets naked and
          crying wo to the godless were probably insane. The followers of
          [86]Adam Pastor were called "Adamites" from their leader. Silly
          stories of orgies by so-called devil-worshipers (the "black
          mass") are sometimes heard at the present time.

   Adamnan
          ADAMNAN ("Little Adam"): Ninth abbot of Iona (679-704); b.
          probably at Drumhome in the southwest part of County Donegal,
          Ireland (50 m. s.w. of Londonderry), c. 625; d. on the island of
          Iona Sept. 23, 704. He was a relative of Columba and the
          greatest of the abbots of Iona after its illustrious founder,
          famed alike for learning (he had some knowledge of even Greek
          and Hebrew), piety, and practical wisdom. He was a friend (and
          perhaps the teacher) of Aldfrid, king of Northumbria (685-705),
          visited his court in 686 and again in 688, and was converted
          there to the Roman tonsure and Easter computation by Ceolfrid of
          Jarrow. He was unable, however, to win over his monks of Iona,
          but had more success in Ireland, where he spent considerable
          time, attended several synods, and warmly advocated the Roman
          usages. Many churches and wells are dedicated to him in Ireland
          and Scotland, and his name appears corrupted into various forms,
          as "Ownan," "Eunan" (the patron of Raphoe), "Dewnan," "Thewnan,"
          and the like.

          The extant writings of Adamnan are: (1) Arculfi relatio de locis
          sanctis, written down from information furnished personally by
          Arculf, a Gallic bishop who was driven to England by stress of
          weather when returning from a visit to Palestine, Syria,
          Alexandria, and Constantinople. Adamnan added notes from other
          sources known to him, and presented the book to King Aldfrid.
          Bede made it the basis of his De locis sanctis and gives
          extracts from it in the Hist. eccl., v. 16, 17. (2) Vita S.
          Columbæ, written between 692 and 697, not so much a life as a
          presentation without order of the saint's prophecies, miracles,
          and visions, but important for the information it gives of the
          customs, the land, the Irish and Scotch tongues, and the history
          of the time. (3) The "Vision of Adamnan," in old Irish,
          describing Adamnan's journey through heaven and hell, is
          probably later than his time, but may present his real spiritual
          experiences and his teaching. Other works are ascribed to him
          without good reason.

          literary work. In his theological position he was a Trinitarian
          Congregationalist. He was historian of the New England
          Historic-Genealogical Society and a member of its Council, a

          Congregational churches of Illinois to the International
          Congregational Council in London, and has also been their
          representative at a number of national councils. He was
          professor in Straight University, New Orleans, 1873-77, and
          president in 1875-77, and then became editor of the Dallas Daily
          Commercial, Dallas, Tex. From 1887 to 1903 he was editorial
          writer on the Chicago Advance, becoming its editor-in-chief in
          the latter year. His principal works are Colonel Hungerford's
          Daughter (Chicago, 1896) and Life of Queen Victoria (1901).

   Adams, Sarah Flower
          ADAMS, SARAH (FULLER) FLOWER: English Unitarian; b. at Harlow
          (25 m. n.e. of London), Essex, Feb. 22, 1805; d. in London Aug.
          14, 1848. Her father was Benjamin Flower (1755-1829), printer,
          editor, and political writer, and, Sept. 24, 1834, she married
          William Bridges Adams (1797-1872), an inventor and engineer of
          distinction, also a writer on political subjects. She was a
          highly gifted woman, much esteemed by a circle of friends which
          included, among others, W. J. Linton, Harriet Martineau, Leigh
          Hunt, and Robert Browning. Inherited deafness and a weak
          constitution prevented her from following the stage as a
          profession, which she had chosen in the belief that "the drama
          is an epitome of the mind and manners of mankind, and wise men
          in all ages have agreed to make it, what in truth it ought to
          be, a supplement to the pulpit." She wrote poems on social and
          political subjects, chiefly for the Anti-Corn-Law League;
          contributed poems and articles to the Monthly Repository during
          the years 1832-53, when it was conducted by her pastor [87]W. J.
          Fox, and published a long poem, The Royal Progress, in the
          Illuminated Magazine in 1845. In book form she published Vivia
          Perpetua, a Dramatic Poem (London, 1841; reprinted with her
          hymns and a memoir by Mrs. E. F. Bridell-Fox, 1893), and The
          Flock at the Fountain (1845), a catechism. In addition, she
          furnished fourteen original hymns and two translations to Hymns
          and Anthems (1840), a collection for Fox's chapel at Finsbury,
          including her best-known production, Nearer, my God, to thee.
          Her sister, Eliza Flower (1803-46), possessed much musical
          talent and furnished the original music for this hymn as well as
          for others in the book.

   Adams, Thomas
          ADAMS, THOMAS: English preacher and commentator of the
          seventeenth century, called by Southey "the prose Shakespeare of
          Puritan theologians . . . scarcely inferior to Fuller in wit or
          to Taylor in fancy." Little is known of his life beyond what may
          be gathered from the title-pages and dedications of his books.
          He was preaching in Bedfordshire in 1612; in 1614 became vicar
          of Wingrave, Bucks; from 1618 to 1623 preached in London; he was
          chaplain to Sir Henry Montagu, lord chief justice of England, in
          1653 was a "necessitous and decrepit" old man, and died probably
          before the Restoration. He published many occasional sermons
          (collected into a folio volume, London, 1630), besides a
          commentary on the Second Epistle of Peter (1633; ed. J. Sherman,
          1839). His works, ed. Thomas Smith, with life by Joseph Angus,
          were published in Nichol's Series of Standard Divines (3 vols.,
          Edinburgh, 1862-63).

   Adams, William
          ADAMS, WILLIAM: American Presbyterian; b. at Colchester, Conn.,
          Jan. 25, 1807; d. at Orange Mountain, N. J., Aug. 31, 1880. He
          was graduated at Yale (1827) and at Andover Theological Seminary
          (1830); was pastor at Brighton, Mass. (1831-34); of the Broome
          Street (Central) Presbyterian Church, New York (1834-53); and of
          the Madison Square Presbyterian Church, formed from the Broome
          Street Church (1853-73). From 1873 till his death he was
          president and professor of sacred rhetoric and pastoral theology
          in Union Theological Seminary. He was one of the leading
          clergymen in New York in his time, and his influence was not
          bounded by his own denomination or land. Besides many individual
          sermons he published an edition of Isaac Taylor's Spirit of
          Hebrew Poetry, with a biographical introduction (New York,
          1862); The Three Gardens (1856); In the World and not of the
          World (1867); Conversations of Jesus Christ with Representative
          Men (1868); Thanksgiving (1869).

   Adams, William Forbes
          ADAMS, WILLIAM FORBES: Protestant Episcopal bishop of Easton
          (Md.); b. at Enniskillen (70 m. s.w. of Belfast), County
          Fermanagh, Ireland, Jan. 2, 1833. He came to America at the age
          of eight, was educated at the University of the South, and was
          admitted to the Mississippi bar in 1854, but subsequently
          studied theology, and was ordained deacon in 1859, and priest in
          the following year. He was rector of St. Paul's Church,
          Woodville, Mass., from 1860 to 1866, when he was called to the
          rectorate of St. Peter's, New Orléans, but went in the following
          year to St. Paul's in the same city, where he remained until
          1875. In that year he was consecrated first missionary bishop of
          New Mexico and Arizona, but was compelled by illness to resign.
          He then accepted the rectorate of Holy Trinity Church,
          Vicksburg, Miss., where he remained from 1876 to 1887, when he
          was consecrated bishop of Easton.

   Adamson, Patrick
          ADAMSON, PATRICK: Scotch prelate; b. in Perth Mar. 15, 1537
          (according to another account, 1543); d. at St. Andrews Feb. 19,
          1592. He was educated at the University of St. Andrews; preached
          for two or three years in Scotland; was in France as private
          tutor at the time of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew; returned
          to Scotland and to the ministry; and was made archbishop of St.
          Andrews in 1576. Thenceforth his life was a continual struggle
          with the Presbyterian party, and he died in poverty. His enemies
          have assailed his character, but all agree that he was a scholar
          and an able preacher and writer. He composed a Latin catechism
          for the young King James, translated the Book of Job into Latin
          hexameters, and wrote a tragedy on the subject of Herod. His
          collected works were published by his son-in-law, Thomas Wilson
          (London, 1619), who also added a life to an edition of his
          treatise De pastoris munere, published separately the same year.

   Adamson, William
          ADAMSON, WILLIAM: Evangelical Union; b. at New Galloway (20 m.
          w. of Dumfries), Kirkcudbrightshire, Aug. 29, 1830. He was
          educated at Glasgow and St. Andrews Universities and at
          Evangelical Union Theological Hall. He was pastor in Perth
          eleven years and in Edinburgh twenty-seven years, and also
          conducted a public theological class in the latter city for
          eighteen years. He was for several years a member of the
          Edinburgh School Board, and took an active interest in politics
          and movements for reform. He is now pastor of the Carver
          Memorial Church, Windermere, Westmorelandshire. His writings
          include The Righteousness of God (London, 1870); The Nature of
          the Atonement (1880); Religious Anecdotes of Scotland (1885);
          Knowledge and Faith (1886); Robert Milligan: A Story (Glasgow,
          1891); Missionary Anecdotes (1896); Argument of Adaptation
          (London, 1897); Life of the Rev. James Morison (1898); Life of
          the Rev. Fergus Ferguson (1900); and Life of the Rev. Joseph
          Parker (1902). He is also the editor of The Christian News.

   Addicks, George B.
          ADDICKS, GEORGE B.: Methodist Episcopalian; b. at Hampton, Ill.,
          Sept. 9, 1854. He was educated at the Central Wesleyan College,
          Warrenton, Mo., and at the Garrett Bible Institute, Evanston,
          Ill. (1876-77). He taught in the preparatory department of the
          Central Wesleyan College in 1875-76, and in 1877-78 preached at
          Geneseo, Ill., being ordained to the Methodist Episcopal
          ministry in the latter year. From 1878 to 1885 he taught the
          German language and literature in Iowa Wesleyan University and
          German College, Mount Pleasant, Ia., and from 1885 to 1890 held
          a pastorate at Pekin, Ill. In 1890 he returned to the Central
          Wesleyan College as professor of practical theology and
          philosophy, and since 1895 has been president and professor of
          philosophy of the same institution. In 1900 he was a delegate to
          the General Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church and was
          a member of the University Senate of the same denomination from
          1896 to 1904.

   Addis, William Edward
          ADDIS, WILLIAM EDWARD: Church of England; b. at Edinburgh May 9,
          1844. He was educated at Glasgow University and Balliol College,
          Oxford (B.A., 1866). Originally a member of the Church of
          England, he became a convert to the Roman Catholic Church in
          1866, and was ordained to the priesthood in 1872 at the London
          Oratory, being parish priest of Sydenham from 1878 to 1888. In
          the latter year he renounced this faith and became minister of
          the Australian Church, Melbourne, Australia, an undenominational
          institution, where he remained until 1892, when he took a
          similar position at the High Pavement Chapel, Nottingham
          (1893-98). In 1899 he was appointed Old Testament lecturer at
          Manchester College, Oxford, and shortly afterward returned to
          the Church of England. His college accordingly attempted to
          expel him and to declare itself officially non-conformist, but
          the movement was proved illegal, and he still retains his
          position, although the hostile attitude of the trustees of
          Manchester College prevents him from resuming his work as a
          priest of the Church of England. He has written A Catholic
          Dictionary (London, 1883; in collaboration with Thomas Arnold);
          Christianity and the Roman Empire (1893); Documents of the
          Hexateuch (2 vols., 1893-98); and Hebrew Religion to the
          Establishment of Judaism Under Ezra (1906).

          ADDISON, DANIEL DULANY: Protestant Episcopalian; b. at Wheeling,
          W. Va., Mar. 11, 1863. He received his education at Union
          College and the Episcopal Theological School, Cambridge, Mass.
          (1886). He was curate of Christ Church, Springfield, Mass., in
          1886-89 and rector of St. Peter's Church, Beverly, Mass., in
          1889-95, while since 1895 he has been rector of All Saints'
          Church, Brookline, Mass. He is examining chaplain to the bishop

          Donations for Education in Liberia, and a trustee of the College
          of Monrovia, Liberia, and of the Brookline public library. In
          1904 he was made Knight Commander of the Liberian Humane Order
          of African Redemption. He has written: Lucy Larcom, Life,
          Letters and Diary (Boston, 1894); Phillips Brooks (1894); Life
          and Times of Edward Bass, First Bishop of Massachusetts (1897);
          All Saints' Church, Brookline (Cambridge, 1896); The Clergy in
          American Life and Letters (New York, 1900); and The
          Episcopalians (1904).

   Adelmann
          ADELMANN: Bishop of Brescia in the eleventh century. The time
          and place of his birth are unknown, and the date of his death,
          as well as that of his consecration as bishop, is uncertain.
          Gams (Series episcoporum, Regensburg, 1872, p. 779) assigns the
          latter two events to 1053 and 1048, respectively. Adelmann
          himself states that he was not a German; he has been commonly
          taken for a Frenchman, but may have been a Lombard. The first
          certain fact of his life is that, together with Berengar of
          Tours, he studied under Fulbert at Chartres. Afterward he
          studied, and later taught (probably from 1042), in the school of
          Liége, then at Speyer. The works which have made him known are:
          (1) a collection of Rhythmi alphabetici de viris illustribus sui
          temporis, devoted to the praise of Fulbert and his school, and
          (2) a letter to Berengar on his eucharistic teaching; the letter
          was written before Berengar's first condemnation, but after his
          departure from the traditional doctrine was notorious (both
          works in MPL, cxliii. 1289-98). The letter is not so much an
          independent investigation as a solemn warning to his friend
          against the danger of falling into heresy. Adelmann treats the
          subject from the purely traditional standpoint, and considers it
          settled by the words of institution. The change (he uses the
          words transferre, transmutare) of the bread and wine into the
          body and blood of Christ takes place invisibly in order to
          afford an opportunity for the exercise of faith; such
          occurrences, accordingly, can not be investigated by reason, but
          must be believed.

   Adelophagi
          ADELOPHAGI, ad´´el-?f´?-j?i or -gî ("Not Eating in Public"):
          Certain people, mentioned in Prædestinatus (i. 71), as thinking
          it unseemly for a Christian to eat while another looked on. They
          are also referred to by Augustine (Hær., lxxi.), who copies
          Philastrius (Hær., lxxvi.) and is uncertain whether their
          scruple included members of their own sect or applied only to
          others. Further statements in Prædestinatus are to be accepted
          with extreme caution.

   Adeney, Walter Frederic
          ADENEY, WALTER FREDERIC: Congregationalist; b. at Ealing (9 m.
          w. of London), Middlesex, Eng., Mar. 14, 1849. He received his
          education at New College and University College, London. He was
          minister of the Congregational Church at Acton, London, from
          1872 to 1889, and from 1887 to the same year was lecturer in
          Biblical and systematic theology at New College, London. In 1889
          he was appointed professor of New Testament exegesis and church
          history in the same institution, holding this position until
          1903, as well as a lectureship on church history in Hackney
          College, London, after 1898. In 1903 he was chosen principal of
          Lancastershire College, in the University of Manchester, and two
          years later was appointed lecturer on the history of doctrine in
          the same university. As a theologian, he accepts the results of
          Biblical criticism which he feels to be warranted, and welcomes
          scientific and philosophic investigation and criticism of
          religion, although he seeks to adhere firmly to basal Christian

   Adeodatus
          ADEODATUS, ??d´´î-o-d??´tus: Bishop of Rome from Apr. 11, 672,
          to his death, June 16, 676. His pontificate was unimportant. The
          Liber pontificalis (ed. Duchesne, i. 346) ascribes to him the
          restoration of the basilica of St. Peter at Campo di Merlo, near
          La Magliana (7 1/2 m. from Rome), and the enlargement of the
          monastery of St. Erasmus in Rome, where he had been a monk. The
          only documents of his extant (MPL, lxxxvii. 1139-46) are
          concessions of privileges to the churches of St. Peter at
          Canterbury and St. Martin at Tours. For his participation in the
          Monothelite controversy, see [89]Monothelites. He is sometimes
          known as Adeodatus II., because the form "Adeodatus" is used
          also for the name of a former pope Deusdedit (615-618).

          Recent Discussion (§ 9).

  1. Classical Greek Usage

          In the history of Christian ethics the term "adiaphora" (pl. of
          Gk., adiaphoron, "indifferent") signifies actions which God
          neither bids nor forbids, the performance or omission of which
          is accordingly left as a matter of indifference. The term was
          employed by the Cynics, and borrowed by the Stoics. To the
          latter that only was good or evil which was always so and which
          man could control. Such matters as health, riches, etc., and
          their opposites were classed as adiaphora, being regarded for
          this purpose, not as actions, but as things or conditions.
          Adiaphora were divided into absolute and relative; the former
          being such as had to do with meaningless distinctions, while the
          latter involved preference, as in the case of sickness versus
          health. The Stoics did not, however, from the adiaphoristic
          nature of external things deduce that of the actions connected
          therewith.

  2. Christ's Usage.

          Jesus's ideal of righteousness as devotion of the entire person
          to God revealed as perfect moral character, signified, on the
          one side, freedom from every obligation to a statutory law,
          particularly precepts concerning worship. He regarded the
          observance of external rites as a matter of indifference so far
          as real personal purity was concerned, and, with his disciples
          observed the Jewish rites as a means to the fulfilment of his
          mission to Israel when they did not interfere with doing good
          (Mark iii. 4). Yet this ideal involved such a sharpening of
          moral obligation that in the presence of its unqualified
          earnestness and comprehensive scope there was no room for the
          question, so important to legalistic Judaism, how much one might
          do or leave undone without transgressing the Law. The slightest
          act, like the individual word, had the highest ethical
          significance to the extent that it was an expression of the
          "abundance of the heart" (Matt. xii. 25-37).

  3. Paul's Usage.

          Paul emphasizes, on the one hand, the comprehensive character of
          Christian ethics and, on the other, the freedom which is the
          Christian's; and he concludes that the observance or disregard
          of dicta pertaining to external things is a matter of
          indifference in its bearing on the kingdom of God (Rom. xiv. 17;
          I Cor. vi. 12, viii. 8; Gal. v. 6; Col. ii. 20). He recognizes,
          with the exception of the Lord's Supper, no forms for Christian
          worship, but merely counsels that "all things be done decently
          and in order" (I Cor. xiv. 40). From the fact that the Christian
          belongs to God, the Lord of the world, Paul deduces the
          authority (Gk. exousia) of Christians over all things (I Cor.
          iii. 21-23), especially the right freely to make use of the free
          gifts of God (I Cor. x. 23, 26; Rom. xiv. 14, 20). Ability to
          return thanks for them is made the subjective criterion of their
          purity (Rom. xiv. 6; I Cor. x. 30). Those things also are
          permissible which are left free by implication in the ordinances
          of the Church, or are expressly allowed. But action in the
          domain of the permissible is restricted for the individual by
          ethical principles according to which he must be bound (Rom.
          xiv. 2 sqq.; I Cor. vi. 12, viii. 9, x. 23). Concrete action in
          all such cases he regards as not at the pleasure of the
          individual, but as bidden or forbidden for the sake of God.

  4. Patristic and Medieval Usage.

          In place of this view of freedom, combining obligation with
          unconstraint, there soon arose one of a more legal cast. At the
          time of Tertullian there was in connection with concrete
          questions a conflict between the two principles (1) that what is
          not expressly permitted by Scripture is forbidden; and (2) that
          what is not expressly forbidden is permitted. The restriction of
          the idea of duty by that of the permissible, and the recognition
          of an adiaphoristic sphere were further confirmed by the
          distinction between præcepta and consilia and by the doctrine of
          supererogatory merits. The question of adiaphora was argued by
          the schoolmen. Thomas Aquinas and his followers held that there
          were certain actions which, so far as being intrinsically
          capable of subserving a good or an ill purpose, were matters of
          indifference; but they recognized no act proceeding from
          conscious consideration which was not either disposed toward a
          fitting end or not so disposed, and hence good or bad. Duns
          Scotus and his adherents recognized actions indifferent in
          individuo, i.e., those not to be deemed wrong though without
          reference, actual or virtual, to God. The early Church at first
          appropriated the Cynic and Stoic opposition to culture, holding
          that it interfered with the contemplation of God and divine
          things. But with large heathen accessions, this attitude was no
          longer maintained. The primitive Christian ideal was, to be
          sure, preserved; but its complete fulfilment was required of
          only those bound thereto by the nature of their calling.

  5. Luther's Usage.

          Luther based his position on that of Paul. He appears, indeed,
          to determine the idea of adiaphora (the expression does not
          occur in his works) according to a legalizing criterion when he
          distinguishes between things or works which are clearly bidden
          or forbidden by God in the New Testament and those which are
          left free--to neglect which is no wrong; to observe, no piety.
          But he further says in the same connection that under the rule
          of faith the conscience is free, and Christians are superior to
          all things, particularly externals and precepts in connection
          therewith. In accordance with this view he considers that an
          external form of divine worship is nowhere enjoined (the Lord's
          Supper is a beneficium, not an officium); and he distinguishes
          between the necessary and the free in churchly forms by their
          effects. Prayer, the Lord's Supper, and preaching are necessary
          to edification; but the time, place, and mode have no part in
          edification, and are free. His standpoint, then, was not simply
          that there were certain things left free, but that the assertion
          of freedom (or adiaphorism) applied to the whole realm of
          externals. In individual cases, however, a limitation was
          imposed by ethical aims and rules. Christians were to take part
          in the external worship of God to fulfil the duty of public
          confession and that they might "communicate" (Heb. xiii. 16).
          Ceremonial forms served to perpetuate certain effective modes of
          observance; but they were not to be idolatrous, superstitious,
          or pompous. Luther, in opposition to Carlstadt, urged that in
          the forms of worship for the sake of avoiding offense to some,
          whatever was not positively objectionable should be suffered to
          remain. He was ready to concede the episcopal form of church
          government and other matters, if urged not as necessary to
          salvation, but as conducive to order and peace. He wished, also,
          to maintain Christian freedom against stubborn adherents of the
          Law.

  6. First Adiaphoristic Controversy.

          The churchly adiaphora formed the subject of the first
          adiaphoristic controversy. The Wittenberg theologians believed
          that the concessions on the basis of which the Leipsic interim
          was concluded could be justified by the principles enunciated
          and exemplified at the outset of the Reformation. They held
          that, despite formal modifications, they had surrendered only
          traditional points of church government and worship, and even
          then only such as were unopposed by Scripture, had been so
          recognized in the primitive Church, and had seemed to themselves
          excellent arrangements, conducive to order and discipline.
          Further, they maintained that every idolatrous usage had been
          discountenanced, and that from what was retained idolatrous
          significance had been excluded. It may be mentioned, by way of
          example, that the Latin liturgy of the mass was admitted, with
          lights, canonicals, etc., though with communion and some German
          hymns; also confirmation, Corpus Christi day, extreme unction,
          fasting, and the jurisdiction of bishops.

  7. Flacius's Restriction of Adiaphora.

          Before the interim had been authentically published there arose
          a controversy in which the attack was led by Flacius. In his De
          veris et falsis adiaphoris (1549), he raised the question by not
          only maintaining that preaching, baptism, the Lord's Supper, and
          absolution had been commanded by God, but even by concluding
          from I Cor. xiv. 40 that the ceremonial usages connected
          therewith had been divinely ordained in genere. He also sought
          to limit the Lutheran indifference to detail by insisting on
          what he deemed seriousness and dignity in the liturgy, as
          opposed to the canonicals, music, and spectacles of the Catholic
          Church. In addition he protested that what might be called the
          individual character of the Church was to be conserved, and that
          existing means of edification should be altered only in favor of
          better ones. Under the circumstances obtaining at the time, he
          said, even a matter in itself unessential could not be treated
          as permissible, and the concessions of the interim were an act
          of treachery: they were occasioned by the endeavors of the
          emperor to restore the Catholic Church, the promulgators being
          moved by fear, or at best by lack of faith; and in effect they
          were an admission of past errors, strengthening their opponents,
          while the rank and file, looking at externals only, would see in
          the restoration of discarded usages a reversion to the old
          conditions. The dispute continued after the peace of Augsburg;
          and the Formula Concordiæ not only drew the distinction (art.
          X.) that in time of persecution, when confession was necessary,
          there should be no concession to the enemies of the Gospel, even
          in adiaphora, since truth and Christian freedom were at stake,
          but to some extent appropriated Flacius's restriction of the
          idea of adiaphora.

  8. Second Controversy.

          In the so-called second adiaphoristic controversy the Lutheran
          and Calvinistic systems came into conflict. Luther had
          maintained the right of temperate enjoyment of secular
          amusements. Calvin, on the other hand, stood for fundamentally
          different principles, in accordance with which he enforced his
          Genevan code of discipline. Voetius carried these principles
          still further. On the Lutheran side was Meisner, who is in this
          respect the classic opponent of the Calvinists. He puts secular
          amusements under the head of adiaphora as being actions neither
          right nor wrong per se but per aliud,--the person and the
          purpose especially to be considered,--and in concrete instances
          becoming always either right or wrong. The controversy began at
          the close of the seventeenth century, when secular amusements
          were attacked per se by several writers, such as Reiser and
          Winkler, the Pietistic theologians of Hamburg, Vockerodt, Lange,
          and Zierold. Lange, for example, contended that in the light of
          revealed law there are no indifferent acts. Those actions alone
          are right which are under the influence of the Holy Spirit for
          the honor of God in the faith and name of Christ; and he holds
          that the divine will exercises a direct and immediate control.
          Hence actions not bidden of God are necessarily actions which
          profit not and are therefore collectively wrong. He enumerates
          nineteen separate reasons why Christians should take no part in
          secular amusements and would exclude from the Lord's Supper
          those who do. He regards the defense of adiaphora as a heresy
          which abrogates all evangelical doctrine. Spener's theory was
          equally severe, but his practise was wisely modified. He
          counseled that those who participated in secular amusements
          should be dissuaded therefrom not harshly, but by indirect
          exhortations to follow Christ; and he would not refuse
          absolution to such, since many of them did not really appreciate
          the wrong of those things. Rothe, Warnsdorf, and Schelwig were
          the principal champions of the previously existing Lutheran
          teaching; but their defense was far less resolute than the
          attack.

  9. Recent Discussion.

          The question of adiaphora has subsequently been a subject of
          discussion. The first to introduce a new point of view of any
          considerable value was Schleiermacher (Kritik der bisherigen
          Sittenlehre, 2d ed.; Werke zur Philosophie, ii.), who contested
          the ethical right of adiaphora on the basis of the necessity in
          the moral life of unity and stability. Only in the realm of
          civil law, and in the moral judgment of others whose actions
          must frequently, for lack of evidence, remain unexplained, does
          he admit of adiaphora. Most later evangelical authorities, for
          example Martensen, Pfleiderer, Wuttke, and, most closely, Rothe,
          are in substantial agreement with this position, though
          introducing some variations and modifications.

          (J. Gottschick.)

          Among British and American Christians no adiaphoristic
          controversy has found place; but the types of religious and
          ethical thought that underlay the opposing forces in the
          controversies above considered have been in conflict at all
          times and everywhere. English Puritanism and early Scottish
          Presbyterianism, as well as New England Puritanism, either
          rejected adiaphora wholly or reduced them to the smallest
          proportions. The English Tractarians in seeking to overcome the
          difficulties involved in uniting with the Church of Rome gave
          earnest attention to adiaphora. A sign of the times is the
          watchword of the Evangelical Alliance, "In essentials, unity; in
          nonessentials, liberty; in all things, charity." The Lambeth
          articles proposing the Nicene and Apostles' Creeds, the two
          sacraments, the open Bible, and the historic episcopate as the
          basis of union with non-conforming Churches treated as adiaphora
          the Athanasian Creed, uniformity of worship, and use of the
          Prayer Book. The Protestant Episcopal Church in America has
          settled the chief point in dispute between Churchman and Puritan
          by eliminating the State from necessary union with the Church.
          In the union of religious bodies both in Great Britain and
          America, for which there is a growing tendency, minor
          differences are ignored in favor of essential principles. In all
          Churches some dogmas once deemed essential to the integrity of
          truth are laid aside never to regain their former position (cf.
          the Westminster Confession with the "Brief Statement of Faith"
          published by authority of the Presbyterian Church in the United
          States). With reference to conduct prescribed by ecclesiastical
          bodies or recognized as belonging to personal
          responsibility--the "personal instance"--two diametrically
          opposite tendencies are evident. In the first case, the spirit
          of democracy and of enlightened public sentiment is rapidly
          withdrawing many actions once regarded as legitimately under
          church jurisdiction, as amusements and the like, from such
          supervision. In the second case, if life is to be ruled by moral
          maxims, many actions must be left morally indeterminate, yet
          when every deed is seen to be not atomistic but an integral part
          of self-realization, then all actions take their organic place
          in the serious or happy fulfilment of life's aim. In both
          instances alike, however, the moral adiaphora disappear.

          Alzey (20 m. s.w. of Mainz) Aug. 13, 1851. He came to America in
          1857, when his father was called to the rabbinate of Temple
          Emanu-El, New York City, and was educated at Columbia College
          (A.B., 1870), the Hochschule für die Wissenschaft des Judenthums
          at Berlin and the university of the same city, and the
          University of Heidelberg (Ph.D., 1873). From 1874 to 1876 he was
          professor of Hebrew and Oriental literature at Cornell, but in
          the latter year went to New York and established the Society for
          Ethical Culture, a non-religious association for the ethical
          improvement of its members, of which he has since been the head.
          He has been active in various philanthropic enterprises and in
          popular education, being a member of the State Tenement
          Committee in 1884 and of the Committee of Fifteen in 1901, and
          in 1902 was appointed professor of political and social ethics

          Congregations of the British Empire; b. at Hanover, Germany, May
          30, 1839. He was educated at the University College School and
          University College, London (B.A., 1859), and also at the
          universities of Prague and Leipsic (Ph.D., Leipsic, 1861). He
          received the rabbinical diploma at Prague in 1862, and in the
          following year was appointed principal of Jews' College, London.
          In 1864 he became minister of the Bayswater Synagogue, London,
          but continued to be tutor in theology in Jews' College until
          1879, when he was appointed delegate chief rabbi to relieve his
          father, Nathan Marcus Adler, whom age had rendered unable to
          perform all the duties of chief rabbi. On the death of his
          father, Adler was chosen his successor as chief rabbi in 1891,
          and at the same time was elected president of Jews' College,
          where he had already been chairman of the council since 1887. He
          is also president of Aria College and the London beth din,
          vice-president of the National Society for the Prevention of
          Cruelty to Children and the Mansion House Association for
          Improving the Dwellings of the Poor, governor of University
          College, and a member of the committee of the King Edward
          Hospital Fund and the Metropolitan Hospital Sunday Fund. He has
          likewise been president of the Jewish Historical Society,
          vice-president of the Jewish Religious Educational Board and the
          Anglo-Jewish Association, and representative of the Russo-Jewish
          Committee at Berlin (1889) and Paris (1890). In addition to
          numerous briefer contributions, he has written Solomon ibn
          Gabirol and his Influence upon Scholastic Philosophy (London,
          1865) and Sermons on the Biblical Passages adduced by Christian
          Theologians in Support of the Dogmas of their Faith (1869).

          universities of Göttingen, Erlangen (Ph.D., 1826), Würzburg, and
          Heidelberg, and in 1830 was appointed chief rabbi of Oldenburg.
          Before a year had passed he was made chief rabbi of the kingdom
          of Hanover, and in 1845 he was installed in the far more
          important post of chief rabbi of the British Empire. In 1845 he
          received the assistance of a deputy delegate chief rabbi, but
          retained his own position until his death. Active both in
          philanthropic and educational measures, he was the founder of
          Jews' College, London, in 1855, besides being the real
          originator of the Hospital Sabbath among his coreligionists. He
          was the author of many works in English, German, and Hebrew,
          including Die Liebe zum Vaterlande (Hanover, 1838); The Jewish
          Faith (London, 1867); and Nethinah la-Ger (commentary on the
          Targum of Onkelos, Wilna, 1875).

          Adoption is a term of theology denoting the new relation to God
          which Jesus experienced and into which he brings his followers.
          In tracing the history of this conception, attention is to be
          paid to the different senses in which the analogy is used in
          religion, the idea of homogeneousness with God, of the relation
          to him, and the divine basis of both.

  1. Old Testament Conception.

          In the Old Testament, the people, the king, and individual pious
          men and women are called children of God. The people become
          children of God by their introduction into the promised land,
          the king by his election, individual persons by their physical
          creation. It is only with regard to the heavenly spirits that
          the state of being a child of God (Gotteskindschaft) expresses
          homogeneousness of being. The relation is one in which God
          helps, pardons, educates, even through suffering, and in which
          men have to obey God and trust in him. But the obedience of
          children is not different from that of servants, and their trust
          is paralyzed by God's inexplicable disposition to wrath. In
          later Judaism the relation became one of right,--the pious man
          must secure his reward, which is a matter of natural desire, by
          his own merits and sacrifices, and he always wavers between
          self-righteous security and anxiety.

  2. The Conception of Jesus.

          Jesus as seen in the synoptic Gospels, knows God as the lofty
          lord to whom men are subjected in service, and as the just
          judge; but by inner experiences he recognizes this God as his
          father who discloses to him his love, and he encourages men to
          believe not that they are God's children, but that they become
          such by conducting themselves and feeling as children. The
          innovation lies in the quality of the relation. In spite of
          God's physical and spiritual superiority, man is free from the
          feeling of oppression and insecurity, in the first place, before
          the demanding will of God. Through the recognition of God as
          Father, Jesus knows himself urged to the service of saving love,
          renouncing every worldly desire, but this service means for him
          freedom and blessedness (Matt. xi. 28-30), because he feels it
          as the fulfilment of his own desire (Matt. ix. 36-38), and even
          as a gain in greatness and power (Matt. xx. 25-28), because in
          it he is raised above the Mosaic law (Matt. v. 22). In the same
          way he delivers these whom he encourages to believe in God's
          fatherly love and forgiveness, from the oppression of the law by
          showing them as its innermost core (Matt. v. 9, 48) the
          imitation of the example of the perfect God in a love which
          surpasses all bounds of human love. From this conception of the
          divine law all hedonistic elements have been removed; it
          expresses a reverent and cheerful devotion to an ideal. Where
          Jesus also uses God's retribution as an ethical motive and thus
          seems to substitute a relation of right for the relation of
          adoption, he deepens and purifies the traditional view. Reward
          goes hand in hand with conduct; a childlike disposition is
          rewarded with the dignity due to God's children (Matt. v. 9) and
          with physical homogeneousness (Luke vii. 36); justice is
          rewarded with justice (Matt. v. 6; vi. 33). He promises the
          kingdom (Matt. x. 13-16) to the unassuming childlike
          disposition, and promises reward, not to individual performance,
          but to the spirit which reveals itself in it (Matt. vii. 15,
          xxv. 23), excludes the equivalence between work and reward
          (Matt. xx. 1-16), and appeals to fear not as dread of physical
          evil, but as anxiety lest the life with God (Matt. x. 18) be
          lost. In the second place, the trust in God's fatherly guidance
          which Jesus himself proves and encourages, is of a singular
          surety and joyfulness. Whoever through fear of God is kept in
          his way, may be certain of the acquisition of salvation (Luke x.
          20) and may hope not only to gain eternal life (Luke xii. 32),
          but already here on earth he knows himself to be lifted above
          all oppression of the world since he may be sure that his
          prayers are granted (Matt. vii. 7) and may expect from God his
          daily bread and know himself protected by God in every way
          (Matt. x. 28-31) and may venture even that which seems
          impossible (Mark xi. 22) and be sure of the forgiveness of his
          sins and of his protection in temptation (Matt. vi. 12, 13) and
          triumph over all hostile powers (Luke x. 19).

          In opposition to philosophy, this idea is new in so far as God
          in the current systems of philosophy was represented as father
          only as the shaper of the world, and the capacity of becoming a
          child of God was merely a general function of reason. The
          religious importance of the ideal is here only secondary; it
          originates rather in personal dignity and is an altruism which
          does not extend to the love of enemies. As faith in a fatherly
          providence, it believes only in an order of the world which
          offers an opportunity to prove one's strength of will, and thus
          does not attain submission as expressed in Christian adoption,
          but only resignation.

          Jesus speaks of adoption only in the imperative,--we must become
          children of God by imitation of God and trust in God; but he
          admonishes to become such by pointing to God's disposition and
          promise. His word receives additional emphasis from his
          personality which lives in God; and he judges the conduct of
          God's child in the last analysis as an effect of God (Matt. xi.
          28, xv. 3; Mark x. 27). Therefore it is the natural expression
          of the experience of the Christian Church when in the New
          Testament the awakening of the child's life by the effect of
          divine grace is considered fundamental (II Cor. v. 17; I Pet. i.
          3, 23; John iii. 5).

  3. Paul's Conception.

          This effect, according to Paul, is juridical, i.e., a real
          adoption, a granting of the right of children (Gal. iii. 26-27),
          synonymous with justification; but it is also a real change
          through the overwhelming influence of the Holy Spirit as an
          unconscious power like the impersonal powers of nature (Rom.
          viii. 11; Gal. v. 22). Paul bases the certainty of the right of
          children upon the fact that through faith and baptism believers
          belong to Christ, but also upon the experience of the liberating
          effect of the spirit. The right of children means for him the
          claim upon the future heritage of the kingdom of God; namely,
          the participation in God's fatherhood (Rom. iv. 3) and the
          spiritualization of the body in conforming it to the body of
          Christ, the first of the sons of God (Rom. viii. 29-30). These
          figures express the idea that the prevening grace of God
          establishes a personal relation of love which has an analogy in
          the intimate communion between father and child. As I am certain
          that God is on my side and that I am called to eternal life, I
          may surely trust that he will grant me everything (Rom. viii.
          31-32), not only eternal life, but also everything in the world
          which is not against God (I Cor. iii. 21-22) and that he will
          lead me through all temptations to that sanctity which belongs
          to the kingdom of God (I Thess. v. 23). The faith which
          corresponds on our part to God's intention of love remains
          secure even against troubles and hostile world powers because
          the latter can not separate from the love of God (Rom. viii.
          38-39) and the former must subserve the upbuilding of the inner
          man (II Cor. iv. 16-18). Thus the essential feature of this
          child-life is not fear, as under the Law and its curse, but
          rather unshakable joy which expresses itself in giving thanks as
          the key-note of prayer. The unconscious impulse which the
          ethical life of the Christian assumes if he puts the impulse of
          the spirit in place of the Law, he modifies by bringing to
          expression also conscious ethical motives; namely, the love of
          God as experienced by him, and his call to the kingdom of God,
          which demand a conduct worthy of both. Even an overpowerful
          desire of his nature he begins to transform into an impulse for
          consciousness if he guides it into the channel of experienced
          love (II Cor. v. 15; Gal. ii. 20). But in all joy, happiness,
          and freedom with relation to God, the Christian is prevented
          from excesses by that humility which in all progress and success
          gives due honor to God (I Cor. xv. 10). It seems a contradiction
          when Paul in spite of all speaks of a retribution on the part of
          God according to works and awakens fear of the judgment. The
          seeming relation of right is only an expression for the fact
          that the relation of father and children, although resting upon
          God's free love, is mutual. The reward is a success of mutual
          effort (Gal. vi. 7, 8). It is attained, not by a sum of
          individual works, but by a sanctified personality (Thess. v. 23)
          which is absorbed in a uniform activity of life (II Cor. v. 10;
          I Cor. iii. 13). The fear of which Paul speaks is the fear of
          watchfulness which takes possession of us in looking at the
          world and the flesh, but this disagreeable feeling is
          immediately conquered by the joyful trust that God will protect
          and perfect us (I Cor. xv. 2; Rom. xi. 20-21).

  4. The Gospel and Epistles of John.

          The Gospel and Epistles of John trace adoption back to the
          testimony of God (Gospel iii. 5; First Epistle ii. 19).
          According to them, adoption consists in a close and intimate
          life in and with God by which there is vouchsafed, on the one
          hand, the impossibility of sinning and the self-evidence of
          justice and love to God and our brethren, and, on the other
          hand, the victory over the world and blessing and the future
          homogeneousness with God (I John iv. 3; v. 4;). However natural
          all this may sound, these expressions are only figures for an
          ethico-personal communion with God, analogous to that between
          father and child which has its basis in the influence of Christ
          upon our consciousness, not in a reflected, but spontaneous way.
          The knowledge of God or the word of Christ (I John ii. 3; Gospel
          xv. 3) is parallel to the seed of God which remains in the
          regenerated person and guarantees his sanctity (I John iii. 9).
          Unity of life with God is an analogon for that unity which on
          earth exists between the Father and Jesus (John xvii. 21-22),
          where the Father in preceding love discloses to his Son his
          whole work and the Son remains in the love of the Father (John
          xv. 10) by speaking and acting according to the commandment of
          the Father and being solely concerned with his Father's honor
          (John v. 44) and yet enjoying full satisfaction, eternal life
          (John iv. 34, xii. 50), and at the same time fully trusting that
          the Father is with him and always hears him and in spite of the
          world brings his work to perfection which through death leads to
          glory (John viii. 29, xvi. 32, xvii. 4). Correspondingly there
          follows for his disciples from the certainty of the love of God
          the duty to love one another and to show the self-evident love
          of children by keeping the commandments (I John iv. 11, v. 3)
          which are freedom and life because the disciples are not slaves,
          but friends of the son of God (John xv. 15) and continuators of
          his work (John xviii. 18). In this tendency of life they may
          possess joyfulness (I John ii. 28, iv. 17, 18) in a world full
          of temptations and enemies and in face of death and judgment and
          may count upon the return of their love on the part of God
          through the gift of the spirit and the help of God which is
          always near, upon the forgiveness of accidental sins,
          purification, hearing of their prayers, and a place in the
          heavenly mansion of the Father (John xiv. 2, 3; xiii. 21-22; xv.
          2; xvii. 17; I John i. 9).

          According to Jesus, Paul, and John, the child of God is
          independent of men and yet he must seek communion with men.
          Jesus teaches to pray "Our Father"; and according to Paul and
          John, the spirit communicates with the individual through
          baptism and makes him a member of the community.

  5. The Apologists.

          The Church has not always maintained this ideal. When its growth
          necessitated a stricter inculcation of the ethical conditions of
          salvation, the relation of children was changed under the
          influence of the Jewish idea of retaliation, of philosophical
          moralism, and the ideas of Roman law. According to the
          apologetic writers, to be a child of God means subjectively the
          ethical resemblance with God which man realizes in himself by
          his free action on the basis of the knowledge of God as taught
          by Christ. Since ethics was absorbed in individual practise of
          virtue and consciousness of moral freedom, the desire for a
          counterbalance against the moral checks from the world was not
          felt so much. Irenæus follows Paul by conceiving adoption as the
          specific effect of redemption; but he understands it, in the
          first place, in a moralistic sense, as a call to the fulfilment
          of the deepened law of nature, not only in increased love, but
          fear; in the second place, in a physical sense, as the
          sacramental elevation of the spirit to deification or
          imperishableness. This combination remains a characteristic
          feature of the Greek Church.

  6. Augustine.

          Augustine deepened the physical change into an ethical change
          which governs ethical actions. Because God's nature is first of
          all justice, and only secondarily immortal, adoption, as being
          deification, is in the first place justification, infusion of
          love (amando Deum efficimur dii--"by loving God we are made
          gods"; again--"he who justifies also deifies, because by
          justifying he makes sons of God"), which takes place under the
          influence of faith, i.e., hopeful prayer, or through baptism.
          Thus man faces the task--Reddite diem, efficimini spiritus ("Do
          your part, and become spirit"). Adoption becomes a reality in a
          process in which the capacity for it increases by continual
          forgiveness and inspiration of love until after death the second
          adoption occurs, the liberation from the body which contains the
          law of sin. Our life is a relation between child and father in
          so far as love to God, childlike fear, and hope rule in it. But
          the idea of the New Testament is curtailed in so far as
          forgiveness concerns always only past sins, and hope is bound to
          rely upon one's own consciousness of love to God and upon merit,
          and forgiveness becomes uncertain in consequence of
          predestination, and in so far as, with the task to serve God in
          the world, the New Testament manner of trusting in God is also
          done away with, and a holy indifference takes its place. The
          relation of God seems to be intensified in so far as there is
          added as a new element the highest stage of divine love--the
          mystical contemplation of God; but the apparent plus discloses
          itself as a minus, since love to God is now conceived of by
          analogy with that between man and woman instead of that between
          father and child. Mysticism, it is true, elevates man to freedom
          from the Church, but it effects also indifference toward men;
          however, in the premystical stage there shows itself lack of
          independence of the Church.

  7. Scholasticism.

          In the Occident the curtailment of the childlike in Christian
          life was still further indulged in by bringing to prominence the
          ideas of the natural, juridical, and mystical; of the natural in
          so far as according to the scholastics a habit of grace is
          infused into the secret recesses of the soul, the existence of
          which can only be surmised by way of inference from one's own
          ethical transformation; of the juridical in so far as the
          provenience of hope from merit ("spes provenit ex meritis") is
          more strongly emphasized; of the mystical inasmuch as the higher
          stage of the love of God seems realizable only in a thorough
          separation from occupation with worldly matters (the lower stage
          is identified with childlike fear) and inasmuch as even the
          mysticism of calmness and resignation over against an arbitrary
          Lord is far inferior to trust in the Father.

  8. Luther.

          It was Luther who again conceived the relation of Christians to
          God as that of children to a father in the full sense of the
          word. For Luther Christ is the "mirror of the fatherly heart of
          God," the revelation and security of God's gracious disposition,
          and he draws from this "image of grace" faith and individual
          trust. He differs from Paul in so far as he understands by the
          inner testimony of the Holy Spirit the personal certainty of
          faith which has its basis in Christ. As for Paul, so for Luther,
          forgiveness of sins or justification or adoption is a
          declaration of the will of God that he adopts us as children. It
          is more than the remittance of past sins, it is the reception of
          the whole personality into the grace of God, the transposition
          into a permanent state which always has to be seized again by
          faith. Thus it is shown to be an error that meritorious works
          are necessary in order to obtain grace and eternal life. In this
          way Luther does not destroy the ethical quality of adoption, but
          makes it more prominent. For secure trust unites the will with
          God's entire will in love and thus spontaneously produces,
          without needing the instruction and inculcation of the law, the
          free and cheerful fulfilment of the will of God which takes
          place without any thought of reward and in which eternal life is
          enjoyed. This psychological derivation of morality from the
          nature of faith actually invalidates Luther's other derivation
          from the natural or unconscious impulse of the Holy Spirit. Only
          his opposition to the doctrine of merits made him forget to do
          justice to the eschatological motives of morality as they are
          found in Jesus and Paul, although he might have done so,
          considering his premises; for will needs an aim and for the will
          united with God in faith and love, this aim can only be the
          completion of that which was begun here. Faith gives him new
          courage and power for trust in the guidance of the whole life by
          the Father in which again the joy of eternal life is
          anticipated, and thus lays the basis for the freedom of the
          Christian or his royal dominion over all things which manifests
          itself in fearlessness and pride and defiance of Satan, world,
          and death as the counterpart of humble submission to God and
          which through the certainty of the blessing of divine guidance
          surpasses mysticism--ecstasies as well as resignation in God.
          This attitude of children is a life which is homogeneous to that
          of the Father, in the first place, to his disposition, in so far
          as our trust is a reflex of God's disposition toward us and our
          love corresponds to the love of God since it is not borrowed
          from the amiability of men, but is spontaneous, and not a
          divided love like that of men, but an all-comprehending one; in
          the second place, to the nature of God, because this love is
          superhuman, divine, and because faith conquers for itself the
          power of divine omnipotence. This life of adoption, according to
          its whole character, can only originate by a birth from above
          which, according to Luther, takes place since adoption, as
          vouchsafed by Christ, produces faith and with it new life.
          Luther also traces back the new life to a problematic effect of
          the Spirit, like the working of the impersonal powers of nature,
          which God according to his predestination adds to the word of
          Christ in the inner life.

  9. Later German Theology.

          During the period of orthodoxy in Germany trust in God on the
          part of his children was regarded as natural religion. Pietism
          subordinated adoption to regeneration. In theology as influenced
          by Hegel, childlike union with God after the example of
          mysticism was traced back to an inner self-manifestation of the
          absolute spirit. It was Ritschl who renewed the specific ideas
          of Luther.

          J. Gottschick.

  10. Two Views Held at Present.

          At the present time two ideas of adoption are advocated: (1)
          Resting back on Calvin, it is held that the primary relation of
          God to man was that of Creator and Governor. Man is son of God,
          not by virtue of anything in his constitution as a creature of
          God, nor on account of a natural relation to him as subject of
          the divine government, but solely by reason of gracious
          adoption. The only essential sonship is that of Christ primarily
          as the eternal Son, and secondarily as his humanity shares this
          prerogative through union with the divine nature. Through
          adoption the elect in Christ become partakers of Christ's
          sonship. Adoption is grounded neither in justification nor in
          regeneration, but in God's free and sovereign grace alone.
          Through justification the legal and judicial disabilities caused
          by sin are removed; through regeneration the nature is changed
          so as to become filial. Thus a basis is laid for the distinction
          between the state of adoption and the spirit of adoption (R. S.
          Candlish, The Fatherhood of God, London, 1870; J. Macpherson,
          Christian Dogmatics, Edinburgh, 1898). (2) According to the
          other view, man's filial relation to God is archetypal and
          inalienable. Adoption, in order to be real, necessarily involves
          the essential and universal Fatherhood of God and the natural
          and inherent sonship of man to God. By becoming partaker of the
          spirit of Christ, who, as Son, realized the filial ideal of the
          race, one passes out of natural into gracious sonship; that is,
          is adopted into the ethical and spiritual family of God, and so
          enters upon his ideal filial relation to God and his brotherly
          relation to men (A. M. Fairbairn, The Place of Christ in Modern
          Theology, New York, 1893; J. S. Lidgett, The Fatherhood of God,

  1. The Controversy of the Eighth Century. Its Roots.

          Adoptionism--a heresy maintaining that Christ is the Son of God
          by adoption--is of interest chiefly for the commotion which it
          produced in the Spanish and Frankish Churches in the latter part
          of the eighth century, although the formulas around which the
          conflict raged can indeed be traced back to the earliest period
          of Western theology; but the spirit of the controversy and the
          result showed that the orthodoxy of the eighth century could no
          longer entirely accept the ancient formulas. The phrases in
          which such writers as Novatian, Hilary, and Isidore of Seville
          had spoken not merely of the assumption of human nature by the
          Son of God, but also of the assumption of man or the eon of man,
          led by an easy transition to words which seemed to imply that
          Christ, according to his humanity, was the adopted son of God;
          and formulas of this kind occur not infrequently in the old
          Spanish liturgy.

  2. Elipandus, Bishop of Toledo.

          The Spanish bishops of the eighth century, and especially their
          leader, Elipandus (b. 718; bishop of Toledo from about 780), so
          used such phrases as to provoke criticism and disapproval first
          in Asturia, then in the neighboring Frankish kingdom, and
          finally at Rome. A certain [92]Migetius, preaching in that part
          of Spain which was held by the Moors, had given a very gross
          exposition of the doctrine of the Trinity, teaching that there
          were three bodily persons, and a triple manifestation in history
          of the one God. Against him Elipandus wrote a letter vindicating
          the orthodox idea of the immanence of the Trinity, but at the
          same time establishing a very sharp distinction between the
          second person of the Trinity and the human nature of Christ. The
          person of the Son was not that made according to the flesh, in
          time, of the seed of David, but that begotten by the Father
          before all worlds; even after the incarnation, the second person
          of the Godhead is not the bodily, of which Christ says "My
          Father is greater than I," but that of which he says "I and my
          Father are one." Elipandus did not mean to do violence to the
          orthodox teaching by this distinction; but if the expression
          were pressed, the human nature appeared a different person from
          the person of the Eternal Word, and the single personality of
          Christ disappeared. Elipandus defended himself in letters in
          which he used the expression that Christ was only according to
          his Godhead the true and real (proprius) Son of God, and
          according to his manhood an adopted son. The opposition to this
          view was voiced by Beatus, a priest, and the monk Heterius of
          Libana. Elipandus wrote in great excitement to the Asturian
          abbot Fidelis, bitterly attacking his opponents, who first saw
          the letter when they met Fidelis in Nov., 785, on the occasion
          of Queen Adosinda's taking the veil. In reply they wrote a
          treatise, discursive and badly arranged, but strong in its
          patristic quotations, emphasizing the unity of Christ's
          personality. The conflict was complicated by political
          circumstances and by the efforts of Asturia, to attain
          independence of the most powerful Spanish bishop. Complaints
          were carried to Rome, and Adrian I. pronounced at once against
          Elipandus and his supporter, Ascaricus, whom he judged guilty of
          Nestorianism.

  3. Felix, Bishop of Urgel.

          At what period the most prominent representative of Adoptionism,
          Felix, bishop of Urgel in the Pyrenees, first took part in the
          strife is unknown. At the synod of Regensburg in 792, he
          defended the heresy in the presence of Charlemagne, but the
          bishops rejected it. Felix, although he had retracted his
          doctrine, was sent by the emperor to Rome, where Pope Adrian
          kept him a prisoner until he signed an orthodox confession,
          which on his return to Urgel he repudiated as forced, and then
          fled to Moorish territory. In 793 Alcuin, just back from
          England, wrote to Felix begging him to abandon the suspicious
          word "adoption," and to bring Elipandus back into the right
          path; and he followed this up by his controversial treatise
          Adversus hæresim Felicis. About the same time Elipandus and the
          Spanish bishops who belonged to his party addressed a letter to
          the bishops of Gaul, Aquitaine, and Asturia, and to Charlemagne
          himself, asking for a fair investigation and the restoration of
          Felix. Charlemagne communicated with the pope, and caused a new
          investigation of the case in the brilliant assembly at Frankfort
          (794). Two separate encyclicals were the result--one from the
          Frankish and German bishops; the other from those of northern
          Italy--which agreed in condemning Adoptionism. Charlemagne sent
          these, with one from the pope (representing also the bishops of
          central and southern Italy) to Elipandus, urging him not to
          separate himself from the authority of the apostolic see and of
          the universal Church. Strong efforts were put forth to recover
          the infected provinces. Alcuin wrote repeatedly to the monks of
          that region; Leidrad, bishop of Lyons, and the saintly Abbot
          Benedict of Aniane worked there personally, supporting Bishop
          Nefrid of Narbonne. In 798 Felix wrote a book and sent it to
          Alcuin, who replied in the following spring with his more
          extended treatise Adversus Felicem. Felix must by this time have
          been able to return to Urgel, as he wrote thence to Elipandus.
          Leo III. decisively condemned him in a Roman synod of 798 or
          799. Alcuin received a contumelious answer, and was anxious to
          cross swords personally with his antagonist.

  4. Recantation of Felix.

          Leidrad induced Felix to appear before Charlemagne, with the
          promise of a fair hearing from the bishops. They met at
          Aix-la-Chapelle in June, 799 (others say Oct., 798). After a
          lengthy discussion Felix acknowledged himself defeated and was
          restored to communion, though not to his see, and he was placed
          in Leidrad's charge. Felix then composed a recantation, and
          called on the clergy of Urgel to imitate his example. Leidrad
          and Benedict renewed their endeavors, with such success that
          Alcuin was soon able to assert that they had reclaimed 20,000
          souls. He supported them with a treatise in four books against
          Elipandus, and prided himself on the conversion of Felix. The
          heretical leader seems, however, to have quietly retained his
          old beliefs at Lyons for the rest of his life, and even to have
          pushed them logically further, since Agobard, Leidrad's
          successor, accused him of Agnoetism, and wrote a reply to some
          of his posthumous writings. In the Moorish part of Spain,
          Elipandus seems to have had a numerous following; but here also
          he found determined opponents. The belief was gradually
          suppressed, though Alvar of Cordova (d. about 861) found
          troublesome remnants of it.

  5. Later Adoptionist Tendencies.

          With the rise of scholastic theology there was a natural
          tendency of rigid dialectic to lead away from the Christology of
          Cyril and Alcuin toward a rational distinction between the two
          natures, not so much with any wish to insist on this as from a
          devotion to the conception of the immutability of God. This
          caused the charge of Nestorianism to be brought against Abelard.
          Peter Lombard's explanations of the sense in which God became
          man leaned in the same direction. A German defender of this
          aspect of the question, Bishop Eberhard of Bamberg, in the
          twelfth century, accused his opponents roundly of Eutychianism.
          In fact, the assailants of Adoptionism, starting from their
          thesis that Christ is really and truly the Son of God, even
          according to his human nature, because this nature was
          appropriated by the Son of God, came ultimately, for all their
          intention of holding the Church's doctrine of the two natures
          and the two wills, to a quite distinct presentation of an
          altogether divine Person who has assumed impersonal human
          substance and nature. They really deserted the position taken by
          Cyril, though he was one of their main authorities. If one seeks
          the historical origin of this late form of Christological
          controversy, distinguishing it from the immediate cause, it must
          be found in the unsettlement of mind necessarily consequent upon
          the attempts of the ecclesiastical Christology to reconcile
          mutually exclusive propositions.

  6. Explanation.

          The intellectual mood which led directly to this distinction
          between the Son of God and the man in Christ has been variously
          explained. Some ascribe it to the surrounding Mohammedanism,
          making it an attempt to remove as far as possible the
          stumbling-blocks in the doctrine of Christ's nature; but this
          may be doubted, since the main difficulties from the Moslem
          standpoint--the Trinity, and the idea of a God who begets and is
          begotten--remain untouched. Others see in it a survival of the
          spirit of the old Germanic Arianism, which is excluded by the
          adherence of the Adoptionists to the orthodox Trinitarian
          teaching. The obvious relation with Nestorianism and the
          theology of the school of Antioch has led others to assume a
          direct influence of the writings of Theodore of Mopsuestia; but
          there is as little evidence for this as there is for the theory
          that those whom Elipandus calls his "orthodox brethren" in
          Cordova, and whom Alcuin supposes to be responsible for these
          aberrations, were a colony of eastern Christians of Nestorian
          tendencies who had come to Spain with the Arabs.

   Adoration of the Sacrament
          ADORATION OF THE SACRAMENT: A term of the Roman Catholic Church,
          where, in consequence of the doctrine of transubstantiation
          which affirms the presence of Christ in the Eucharist under the
          species of bread and wine, divine worship is paid to the
          Sacrament of the altar, a worship that includes adoration. This
          adoration is manifested in various ways, especially in
          genuflexions and, if the Sacrament be solemnly exposed, in
          prostrations. Certain forms of devotion are intended to promote
          adoration of the Sacrament, notably the ceremony called
          Benediction of the Blessed Sacrament, the Forty Hours Devotion,
          and the practise of perpetual adoration which secures the

   Adrammelech
          ADRAMMELECH, ?-dram´el-ec: 1. Name of a deity worshiped with
          child-sacrifice by the colonists whom Sargon, king of Assyria,
          transplanted from Sepharvaim to Samaria (II Kings xvii. 31; cf.
          xviii. 34; Isa. xxxvi. 19, xxxvii. 13). Since Sepharvaim is
          probably the Syrian city Shabara'in, mentioned in a Babylonian
          chronicle as having been destroyed by Shalmaneser IV., the god
          Adrammelech is no doubt a Syrian divinity. The name has been
          explained as meaning "Adar the prince," "splendor of the king,"
          and "fire-king," while others think that the original reading
          was "Adadmelech." Since the name is Aramaic, the last is to be
          preferred.

          2. According to II Kings xix. 37 and Isa. xxxvii. 38,
          Adrammelech was the name of the son and murderer of the Assyrian
          king Sennacherib. The form corresponds to the "Adramelus" of
          Abydenus in the Armenian chronicle of Eusebius (ed. A. Schöne,
          i., Berlin, 1875, p. 35) and the "Ardumuzanus" of Alexander
          Polyhistor (p. 27).

   Adrian
          ADRIAN: Author of an extant Introduction to the Holy Scriptures,
          written in Greek. He was evidently a Greek-speaking Syrian; but
          nothing is to be learned of his life from the book. There is no
          doubt, however, that he is identical with the monk and presbyter
          Adrian to whom St. Nilus addressed three letters (ii. 60, iii.
          118, 266, in MPG, lxxix. 225-227, 437, 516-517), and who lived
          in the first half of the fifth century. This work is no
          introduction in the modern sense, but a piece of Biblical
          rhetoric and didactics, aiming to explain the figurative
          phraseology of the Scriptures, especially of the Old Testament,
          from numerous examples. It closes with hints for correct
          exegesis. The hermeneutical and exegetical principles of the
          author are those of the Antiochian school. F. Gössling edited
          the Greek text with German translation and an introduction
          (Berlin, 1887).

   Adrian
          ADRIAN: The name of six popes.

          Adrian I.: Pope 772-795. A Roman of noble birth, he entered the
          clerical state under Paul I., and was ordained deacon by Stephen
          III., whom he succeeded Feb. 1, 772, not, apparently, by as
          unanimous a choice as the official record of his election
          asserts; for soon afterward he encountered vehement opposition
          from the Lombard party in Rome led by Paul Afiarta. His
          adherence to the Frankish faction, his hesitation to crown the
          sons of Karlman, who had fled to Pavia, and thus to set them up
          as pretenders against Charlemagne, and the imprisonment of
          Afiarta by Archbishop Leo of Ravenna at his orders incited the
          Lombard king Desiderius to invade the Roman territory, and
          finally to march on Rome itself. Adrian appealed for help to
          Charlemagne, who arrived in Italy in Sept., 773, and forced
          Desiderius to shut himself up in Pavia.

    Aided by Charlemagne.

          During the siege of that town, which lasted till the following
          June, Charlemagne suddenly appeared unannounced in Rome. Adrian,
          though alarmed, gave him a brilliant reception. On Apr. 6 a
          meeting took place in St. Peter's, at which, according to the
          Vita Hadriani, the emperor was exhorted by the pope to confirm
          the donation of his father, Pepin, and did so, even making some
          additions of territory. This donation, which rests solely upon
          the authority of the Vita (xli.-xliii.), if substantiated, has a
          great importance for the development of the temporal sovereignty
          of the popes. The question has received much attention, and its
          literature is scarcely exceeded in bulk by that of any other
          medieval controversy. No sure and universally recognized result,
          however, has been reached. Some modern historians (Sybel, Ranke,
          Martens) consider the story a pure invention; others (Ficker,
          Duchesne) accept it; and a middle theory of partial
          interpolation has also been upheld (Scheffer-Boichorst). All
          that can be maintained with certainty is that Charlemagne gave a
          promise of a donation, and the geographical delimitations give
          rise to difficult problems.

    Disagreements with Charlemagne.

          In the years immediately following Charlemagne's return from
          Italy, his friendly relations with Adrian were disturbed by more
          than one occurrence. Archbishop Leo of Ravenna seized some
          cities from the pope, who complained to Charlemagne; but Leo
          visited the Frankish court to defend himself, and met with a not
          unfavorable reception. Charlemagne's keen insight can not have
          failed to read imperfectly masked covetousness between the lines
          of Adrian's repeated requests for the final fulfilment of the
          promise of 774; e.g., in the hope held out of a heavenly reward
          if he should enlarge the Church's possessions; in the profuse
          congratulations on his victory over the Saxons, which was
          attributed to the intercession of St. Peter, grateful for the
          restitution of his domain; in the comparison drawn by Adrian
          between Charlemagne and "the most God-fearing emperor
          Constantine the Great," who "out of his great liberality exalted
          the Church of God in Rome and gave her power in Hesperia
          [Italy]"--expressions which have caused a subordinate
          controversy as to whether the so-called [94]Donation of
          Constantine is referred to. How far Adrian's consciousness of
          his own importance had grown is evident from the fact that while
          in the beginning of his reign he had dated his public documents
          by the years of the Greek emperors, from the end of 781 he dated
          them by the years of his own pontificate.

    Charlemagne Again Helps.

          Yet Adrian could not afford to despise the Greeks; they joined
          the Lombard dukes of Benevento and Spoleto, and forced him once
          more to turn for help to Charlemagne, who made a short descent
          into Italy in 776, put down the revolt of the duke of Friuli
          against both him and the pope, but did nothing more until 780.
          In 781 he visited Rome again when his sons were anointed as
          kings--Pepin of Italy and Louis of Aquitaine. Charlemagne came
          to Italy for the fourth time in 786 to crush Arichis of
          Benevento, and Adrian succeeded in obtaining from him additional
          territory in southern Italy. But various misunderstandings in
          Adrian's last years gave rise to a report that Charlemagne and
          Offa of Mercia had taken counsel together with a view to the
          pope's deposition. The iconoclastic controversy (see [95]Images
          and Image-worship, II., § 3) brought fresh humiliations from
          Charlemagne and from the Greek emperor Constantine VI. and his
          mother, the empress Irene. When the last-named was taking steps
          to restore the veneration of images in the Eastern Church she
          requested Adrian to be present in person at a general council
          soon to be held, or at least to send suitable legates (785). In
          his reply, after commending Irene and her son for their
          determination respecting the images, Adrian asked for a
          restitution of the territory taken from the Roman see by the
          iconoclastic emperor Leo III. in 732, as well as of its
          patriarchal rights in Calabria, Sicily, and the Illyrian
          provinces which Leo had suppressed. At the same time he renewed
          the protest made by Gregory the Great against the assumption of
          the title of universalis patriarcha by the Patriarch of
          Constantinople.

    Council of Nicæa in 787.

          When, however, the council met at Nicæa in 787, while it removed
          the prohibition of images, it paid no attention to any of these
          demands. The acts of this council, which Adrian sent to
          Charlemagne in 790, provoked the emperor's vigorous opposition,
          and led ultimately to the drawing up of the [96]Caroline Books,
          in which the position of the Frankish Church with reference to
          both the Roman and the Greek was made plain, and the decisions
          of the Council of Nicæa were disavowed. Although Adrian, after
          receiving a copy, took up the defense of the council with
          vehemence, Charlemagne had the contention of the Caroline Books
          confirmed at the Synod of Frankfort in 794. It may, however,
          have been some consolation to Adrian's legates that the same
          synod publicly condemned [97]Adoptionism, against which the
          Roman as well as the Frankish Church had been struggling. Adrian
          died not long after (Dec. 25, 795).

          Throughout his long pontificate Adrian had been too exclusively
          dominated by the one idea of gaining as much advantage as
          possible in lands and privileges from the strife between the
          Franks and Lombards. He rendered no slight services to the city
          of Rome, rebuilding the walls and aqueducts, and restoring and
          adorning the churches. His was not a strong personality,
          however, and he never succeeded in exercising a dominant or even
          a strongly felt influence upon the policy of western Europe.

   Adrian II
          Adrian II.: Pope 867-872. He was the son of Talarus, of a Roman
          family which had already produced two popes, Stephen IV.
          (768-772) and Sergius II. (844-847). He was a married man before
          entering the clerical state. Gregory IV. made him a cardinal.
          His great benevolence won the hearts of the Romans, and he twice
          refused the papacy, after the death of Leo IV. (855) and of
          Benedict III. (858). A unanimous choice by both clergy and
          people, however, forced him at the age of seventy-five to accept
          it in succession to Nicholas I. (d. Nov. 13, 867). The election
          was confirmed by Emperor Louis II., and Adrian's consecration
          followed on Dec. 14.

    Forces Lothair II. to Take Back His Wife.

          His predecessor had left him a number of unfinished tasks. In
          the first place, it was necessary to arrive at a final decision
          concerning a matter which had long and deeply troubled the
          Frankish Church; namely, the matrimonial relations of King
          Lothair II. Adrian firmly insisted that Lothair should take back
          his legitimate wife Thietberga, at the same time releasing his
          mistress Walrade from the excommunication pronounced against her
          by Nicholas, at the request of Louis II., on condition that she
          should have nothing more to do with Lothair. The last-named
          visited Rome in 869 for the purpose of gaining the pope's
          consent to his divorce from Thietberga. Adrian promised no more
          than to call a new council to investigate the matter, but
          restored Lothair to communion after he had sworn that he had
          obeyed the command of Nicholas I. to break off his relations
          with Walrade. The king's sudden death at Piacenza on his
          homeward journey, a few weeks later, was considered to be a
          divine judgment. The efforts of the pope to enforce the claim of
          Louis II. to Lorraine were fruitless; immediately after
          Lothair's death his uncle, Charles the Bald, had himself crowned
          at Metz, though less than a year later he was forced by his
          brother, Louis the German, to divide the inheritance of Lothair
          in the treaty of Meersen (Aug. 8, 870).

    Opposed by Hincmar of Reims.

          Adrian's attempts to interfere in Frankish affairs were
          stubbornly resisted by [98]Hincmar of Reims, who wrote (Epist.,
          xxvii.), ostensibly as the opinions of certain men friendly to
          the West-Frankish king, that a pope could not be bishop and king
          at one and the same time; that Adrian's predecessors had claimed
          to decide in ecclesiastical matters only; and that he who
          attempted to excommunicate a Christian unjustly deprived himself
          of the power of the keys. When a synod at Douzy near Sedan
          (Aug., 871) excommunicated Bishop Hincmar of Laon, on grave
          charges brought against him both by the king and by his own
          uncle, the more famous Hincmar, the pope allowed an appeal to a
          Roman council, and brought upon himself in consequence a still
          sterner warning from Charles the Bald by the pen of Hincmar of
          Reims (MPL, cxxiv. 881-896), with a threat of his personal
          appearance in Rome. Adrian executed an inglorious retreat. He
          wrote to Charles praising him for his virtues and his benefits
          to the Church, promised him the imperial crown on Louis's death,
          and offered the soothing explanation that earlier less pacific
          letters had been either extorted from him during sickness or
          falsified. In the matter of Hincmar of Laon, he made partial
          concessions, which were completed by his successor, John VIII.

    Conflict with Photius.

          Another conflict which Nicholas I. had left to Adrian, that with
          Photius, patriarch of Constantinople, seemed likely to have a
          happier issue, when Photius was condemned first by a Roman synod
          (June 10, 869), and then by the general council at
          Constantinople in the same year, the papal legates taking a
          position which seemed to make good the claims of the Roman see.
          But Emperor Basil the Macedonian dealt these claims a severe
          blow when he caused the envoys of the Bulgarians (see
          [99]Bulgarians, Conversion of the) to declare to the legates
          that their country belonged to the patriarchate not of Rome, but
          of Constantinople. Adrian's protests were in vain; a Greek
          archbishop appeared among the Bulgarians, and the Latin
          missionaries had to give place. Moravia, on the other hand, was
          firmly attached to Rome, Adrian allowing the use of a Slavic
          liturgy, and naming Methodius archbishop of Sirmium. After a
          pontificate marked principally by defeat, Adrian died between
          Nov. 13 and Dec. 14, 872.

   Adrian III
          Adrian III.: Pope 884-885. He was a Roman by birth, the son of
          Benedict. The story of severe punishments inflicted by him
          points to revolts in the city during his rule. The assertion of
          the untrustworthy Martinus Polonus that he decreed that a newly
          elected pope might proceed at once to consecration without
          waiting for imperial confirmation, and that the imperial crown
          should thenceforth be worn by an Italian prince, are confirmed
          by no contemporary evidence. He died near Modena Aug., 885, on
          his way to attend a diet at Worms on the invitation of Charles
          the Fat, and was buried at Nonantula. [He was the first pope to
          change his name on election, having previously been called
          Agapetus.]

   Adrian IV
          Adrian IV. (Nicholas Breakspeare; the only Englishman in the
          list of the popes): Pope 1154-59. He was born in England about
          the beginning of the twelfth century. He went to France as a
          boy, studied at Paris and Arles, enduring severe privations, and
          finally settled down in the monastery of St. Rufus near Avignon.
          Here he became prior, then abbot (1137), but met with bitter
          opposition from the monks when he attempted to introduce
          reforms. Eugenius III. made him cardinal bishop of Albano, and
          chose him (1152) for the difficult mission of regulating the
          relations of Norway and Sweden to the archbishopric of Lund.
          Returning to Rome, he was welcomed with high honors by
          Anastasius IV., whom he succeeded on Dec. 4, 1154.

    Arnold of Brescia and Frederick Barbarossa.

          His first troubles came through [100]Arnold of Brescia, who,
          besides his ethical opposition to the hierarchy, aimed at
          reestablishing the ancient sovereignty of Rome and its
          independence of the papal see. Adrian strove to secure Arnold's
          banishment, and succeeded in 1155 only by pronouncing an
          interdict on the city. He made Arnold's capture and delivery to
          the ecclesiastical authorities a condition of crowning Frederick
          Barbarossa, who thus sacrificed a man who might have been a
          powerful auxiliary in his conflicts with this very pope. The
          first meeting between Frederick and Adrian (June 9, 1155) was
          marked by friction; but Frederick managed, in return for
          substantial concessions, to secure his coronation nine days
          later. The Romans, however, whose subjection to the papal see
          the new emperor had promised to enforce, refused their
          recognition; and when Frederick left Rome, the pope and
          cardinals accompanied him, practically as fugitives. Frederick
          had also promised to subdue William I. of Sicily, and was
          inclined to carry out his promise, but the pressure of the
          German princes forced him to recross the Alps.

    William I. of Sicily.

          Adrian then attempted to pursue his conflict with William, and,
          by the aid of the latter's discontented vassals, forced him to
          offer terms. When, however, these were not accepted the king
          rallied his forces, the tide turned, and Adrian was obliged to
          grant his opponent the investiture of Sicily, Apulia, and Capua,
          and to renounce important ecclesiastical prerogatives in Sicily
          (Treaty of Benevento June, 1156). In consequence of this
          settlement, he was enabled to return to Rome at the end of the
          year, but the emperor resented this apparent desertion of their
          alliance, as well as the injury to his suzerainty by the papal
          investiture. An open breach came when, at the Diet of Besançon,
          in Oct., 1157, the papal legates (one of them the future
          Alexander III.) delivered a letter from their chief which spoke
          of the conferring of the imperial crown by the ambiguous term
          beneficium. The chancellor, Reginald, archbishop of Cologne, in
          his German rendering, gave it the sense of a fief of the papal
          see; and the legates thought it prudent to leave the assembly
          and retreat speedily to Rome.

    Rebuffed by Frederick Barbarossa.

          Imperial letters spread the same indignation among the people;
          and when Adrian required the prelates of Germany to obtain
          satisfaction from Frederick for his treatment of the legates, he
          was met by the decided expression of their disapproval of the
          offending phrase. Adrian's position was rendered more difficult
          by the appearance of a Greek expedition in Italy and by a revolt
          in Rome; he offered the concession of a brief in which he
          explained the objectionable word in the innocent sense of
          "benefit." Frederick took this as a confession of weakness, and
          when he crossed the Alps to subdue the Lombard towns (1158), he
          required an oath of fealty to himself, as well as substantial
          support from the Italian bishops. Attaining the summit of his
          power with the conquest of Milan in September, two months later
          he had the imperial rights solemnly declared by the leading
          jurists of Bologna. This declaration constituted him the source
          of all secular power and dignity, and was a denial equally of
          the political claims of the papacy and of the aspirations of the
          Lombard towns. The breach with Adrian was still further widened
          by his hesitation to confirm the imperial nomination to the
          archbishopric of Ravenna; and an acute crisis was soon reached.
          An exchange of communications took place, whose manner was
          intended on both sides to be offensive; and Frederick was roused
          to a higher pitch of anger when the papal legates, besides
          accusing him of a breach of the treaty of Constance, demanded
          that he should thenceforth receive no oath of fealty from the
          Italian bishops, that he should either restore the inheritance
          of Countess Matilda, Spoleto, Sardinia, Corsica, Ferrara, etc.,
          to the Roman see, or pay a tribute for those lands, and that he
          should recognize the right of the successor of St. Peter to
          complete and unlimited dominion in Rome. These claims he met by
          declaring roundly that on any strict interpretation of his
          rights the pope also would be bound to take the oath of fealty,
          and that all the latter's possessions were but imperial domains
          held in consequence of Sylvester's investiture by Constantine.

    Impending Conflict Stopped by Adrian's Death.

          Both the opponents sought for allies in the impending struggle.
          Adrian, who was the sworn foe of the Roman republic and its
          liberties, joined hands with the Lombard communes who were
          struggling for their own. The emperor, who was doing his best to
          abolish communal liberty in the north of Italy, aided the Romans
          to uphold the principles of Arnold of Brescia. Adrian was
          already taking counsel with the cardinals as to the advisability
          of pronouncing a sentence of excommunication against Frederick
          when death overtook him at Anagni Sept. 1, 1159.

          Adrian was a ruler who grasped clearly the ideal of a papacy
          striving for universal domination, and contended passionately
          for its accomplishment; but John of Salisbury (who, as
          ambassador of the king of England, had opportunity to study him
          at close range) records that there were moments when the
          terrible burden of his office weighed almost unbearably upon
          him.

          Adrian V. (Ottobuono de' Fieschi): Pope 1276. He was the nephew
          of Innocent IV., and as cardinal deacon had been sent to England
          by Clement IV. to mediate between Henry III. and his barons. He
          was elected July 12, 1276, in a conclave on which Charles of
          Anjou had enforced all the rigor of the regulations of Gregory
          X.; and one of Adrian's first acts was to abrogate them as
          oppressive to the cardinals. Before he could promulgate any new
          system, however, and even before he had been ordained priest, he
          died at Viterbo Aug. 18, 1276.

          Adrian VI. (Adrian Rodenburgh or Dedel, more probably the
          latter): Pope 1522-23. He was born in Utrecht, was educated by
          the Brethren of the Common Life and at Louvain, and became
          professor and vice-chancellor of the university. During this
          period he composed several theological writings, including a
          commentary on the Sententiæ of Peter Lombard. In 1507 Emperor
          Maximilian I. appointed him tutor to his grandson, Charles of
          Spain, and in 1515 Ferdinand the Catholic made him bishop of
          Tortosa. In 1517 he was created cardinal by Leo X. When Charles
          was made German emperor and went to the Netherlands in 1520, he
          appointed Adrian regent of Spain. In 1522 the cardinals almost
          unanimously elected him pope.

    Friend of Reform.

          The vexation of the Romans at the choice of a German, moreover a
          very simple man who was not inclined to continue the splendid
          traditions of the humanistic popes, lasted during his entire
          pontificate; more serious minds, however, looked forward to his
          reign with hope. In spite of the fact that he consented to the
          condemnation of Luther's writings by the Louvain theologians,
          and although as inquisitor general he had shown no clemency, yet
          Erasmus saw in him the right pilot of the Church in those stormy
          times, and hoped that he would abolish many abuses in the Roman
          court. Luis de Vives addressed Adrian with his proposals for
          reform; and Pirkheimer complained to him of the opposition of
          the Dominicans to learning. Even in the college of cardinals,
          the few who favored a reformation looked up to him hopefully,
          and [101]Ægidius of Viterbo transmitted to him a memorial which
          described the corruption of the Church and discussed the means
          of redress.

          Adrian fulfilled these expectations. Concerning indulgences he
          even endeavored to find a way which might lead to a
          reconciliation with Luther's conception, viz., to make the
          effect of the indulgence dependent on the depth of repentance on
          evidence of it in a reformed life. But here Cardinal Cajetan
          asserted that the authority of the pope would suffer, since the
          chief agent would no longer be the pope, but the believer, and
          the majority agreed with the cardinal. Nothing was done in the
          matter, no dogma was revised, and the complaints of the Germans
          increased. Nevertheless, Adrian simplified his household, moneys
          given for Church purposes were no longer used for the support of
          scholars and artists, he sought to reform the abuse of
          pluralities, and opposed simony and nepotism. His effort to
          influence Erasmus to write against Luther and to bring Zwingli
          by a letter to his side shows his attitude toward the
          Reformation in Germany and Switzerland.

    His Confession.

          When the diet at Nuremberg was opened in Dec., 1522, he
          complained in a brief of the rise of heresy in Germany and asked
          the diet, since mild measures could not be effectual, to employ
          the means formerly used against Huss. But in his instructions to
          his legate at the diet, Bishop Chieregati, he took a different
          tone, and acknowledged that "wantonness," "abuses," and
          "excesses" were found at the curia. This is the only instance
          where such a confession received official sanction. An answer
          was prepared by a committee, which took notice of the
          confession, refused to execute the edict of Worms before an
          improvement was visible, and asked for the meeting of a council
          in a German city, promising to prevent Luther from publishing
          his polemical writings and to see to it that the preachers
          proclaimed the pure gospel, but "according to the teaching and
          interpretation of the Scriptures approved and revered by the
          Christian Church." Chieregati accepted neither this nor any
          other answer, but left Nuremberg in haste. In strict papal
          circles Adrian's confession has not yet been forgiven. He died
          at Rome Sept. 14, 1523.

   Adso
          ADSO: One of the more prominent of the reforming abbots of the
          tenth century. He belonged to a noble family in the Jura
          Mountains, became a monk at Luxeuil, and went later to the
          monastery of Montier-en-Der (120 m. e.s.e. of Paris), in the
          diocese of Châlons-sur-Marne, reformed about 935 by the abbot
          Albert, whom he succeeded in 967 or 968. He laid the foundation
          for a splendid new basilica, remains of which are still standing
          (cf. Sackur, Die Cluniacenser, ii. 391), and undertook to reform
          other monasteries, e.g., St. Benignus at Dijon. Like his friends
          Abbo of Fleury and Gerbert of Reims (cf. Havet, Les Lettres de
          Gerbert, pp. 6, 74, Paris, 1889), he was interested in learning
          and investigation; and his library included the writings of
          Aristotle, Porphyry, Terence, Cæsar, and Vergil. He was often
          urged to write books, especially the lives of saints, and
          several works of this class by him may be found in ASM (ii. and
          iv.; copied in MPL, cxxxvii. 597-700).

          The most famous of Adso's writings is the earliest, an Epistola
          ad Gerbergam reginam, de vita et tempore Antichristi, composed
          before 954, in which he opposes the prevalent notion that the
          appearance of Antichrist was near at hand. The work was much
          read, and suffered greatly from mutilations and interpolations
          (cf. MPL, ci. 1289-98); its original form has been restored by
          E. Sackur, in Sibyllinische Texte und Forschungen, pp. 104-113,
          Halle, 1898.

   Advent
          ADVENT: The first season of the church year. The celebration of
          Advent in the Western Church was instituted toward the close of
          the fifth century, in Gaul, Spain, and Italy [but traces of it
          are found in the Council of Saragossa, 380]. The term was first
          understood as referring to the birth of Christ, and so the
          Advent season was a time of preparation for Christmas. Since it
          commenced at different periods (e.g., at Milan with the Sunday
          after St. Martin [Nov. 11]; in Rome with the first in December),
          the number of Sundays in Advent differed in the individual
          churches. The term adventus was also taken in the wider sense of
          the coming of Christ in general; hence the lessons for Advent
          which refer to the second coming of Christ and the last
          judgment. With it was also connected the notion of the coming of
          the kingdom of heaven. Thus originated the idea of the triple
          coming "to man, in man, and against man" or, corresponding to
          the number four of the Sundays which afterward became general,
          the notion of the quadruple coming "in the flesh, in the mind,
          in death, in majesty."

          In the medieval church the Advent season was a time of fasting
          and repentance. Hence one finds in it the figure of John the
          Baptist, as the precursor of Christ and the preacher of
          repentance. The whole season from Advent to the octave of
          Epiphany was a [103]tempus clausum until the Council of Trent,
          which took off the last week. In the Church of Rome Advent has
          still the character of a penitential season. The color of the
          vestments then worn is violet. This character of earnest and
          serious devotion appears in more preaching, teaching, and
          insistence upon attendance at communion. Fasting during Advent
          is not a general ordinance of the Church of Rome [being required
          only on all Fridays, the vigil of Christmas, and the three
          ember-days in the last week of the season].

          With the adoption of the medieval church calendar, the
          Protestants also accepted the Advent season and Advent lessons.
          Thus the season retained its double character, preparation for
          the Christmas festival and contemplation of the different ways
          of the coming of Christ. Since it has become customary to
          separate the civil and ecclesiastical chronology and to
          distinguish between the civil and church years, the first Sunday
          of Advent has been dignified as the solemn beginning of the new
          church year. These various relations of the first Sunday of
          Advent and the whole Advent season explain the variety of the
          contents of the Advent hymns and prayers. Among Protestants also
          the Advent season has a twofold character, that of holy joy and
          of holy repentance. The first Sunday in Advent is no church
          festival in a full sense, but the relations referred to lift it
          and the succeeding Sundays above ordinary Sundays. See
          [104]Church Year.

          In the present usage of the West, the season begins on the
          nearest Sunday to St. Andrew's day (Nov. 30), whether before or
          after. In the Anglican prayer-book the service for the first
          Sunday emphasizes the second coming; that for the second, the
          Holy Scriptures; that for the third, the Christian ministry;
          while only the fourth relates specifically to the first coming.
          Advent in the Eastern Church begins on Nov. 14, thus making a
          season of forty days analogous to Lent.

   Adventists
          ADVENTISTS: The general name of a body embracing several
          branches, whose members look for the proximate personal coming
          of Christ. [106]William Miller, their founder, was a converted
          deist, who in 1816 joined the Baptist Church in Low Hampton, N.
          Y. He became a close student of the Bible, especially of the
          prophecies, and soon satisfied himself that the Advent was to be
          personal and premillennial, and that it was near at hand. He
          began these studies in 1818, but did not enter upon the work of
          the ministry until 1831. The year 1843 was the date agreed upon
          for the Advent; then, more specifically, Oct. 22, 1844, the
          failure of which divided a body of followers that had become
          quite numerous. In the year of his death (1849) they were
          estimated at 50,000. Many who had been drawn into the movement
          by the prevalent excitement left it, and returned to the
          churches from which they had withdrawn. After the second
          failure, Miller and some other leaders discouraged attempts to
          fix exact dates. On this question and on the doctrine of the
          immortality of the soul there have been divisions. There are now
          at least six distinct branches of Adventists, all of which agree
          that the second coming of Christ is to be personal and
          premillennial, and that it is near at hand. The Seventh-day
          Adventists and the Church of God are presbyterial, the others
          congregational in their polity. All practise immersion as the
          mode of baptism.

          1. Evangelical Adventists: This is the oldest branch, indeed the
          original body. The members adopted their Declaration of
          Principles in conference in Albany, N. Y., in 1845, and in 1858
          formed the American Millennial Association to print and
          circulate literature on eschatology from their point of view.
          Their organ was the weekly paper The Signs of the Times, which
          had been established in Boston in 1840; subsequently its name
          was changed to The Advent Herald and later still to Messiah's
          Herald, its present (1906) title. The paper has always been
          published in Boston. The Evangelical Adventists differ from all
          the other branches in maintaining the consciousness of the dead
          in Hades and the eternal sufferings of the lost.

          D. T. Taylor, The Reign of Christ, Peacedale, R. I., 1855, and
          Boston, 1889.

          2. Seventh-day Adventists: This branch dates from 1845, in which
          year, at Washington, N. H., a body of Adventists adopted the
          belief that the seventh day of the week is the Sabbath for
          Christians and is obligatory upon them. In 1850 their chief
          organ, The Advent Review and Sabbath Herald, was first issued at
          Battle Creek, Mich., which was made the headquarters of the
          body: and there in 1860 a publishing association, in 1862 a
          general annual conference, in 1866 a health institute, and in
          1874 an educational society and a foreign mission board were
          established. In 1903 the publishing business and the general
          headquarters were removed to Washington, D. C. Their organ is
          now styled The Review and Herald. Besides the tenet which gives
          them their name they hold that man is not immortal, that the
          dead sleep in unconsciousness, and that the unsaved never awake.
          They practise foot-washing and accept the charismata, maintain a
          tithing system, and pay great attention to health and total
          abstinence. They accept Mrs. Ellen G. White as an inspired
          prophetess.

          3. Advent Christians: The organization under this name dates
          from 1861, when a general association was formed. The organ of
          these Adventists is The World's Crisis and Second Advent
          Messenger, published in Boston. Their creed is given in the
          Declaration of Principles, approved by the general conference of
          1900. They believe that through sin man forfeited immortality
          and that only through faith in Christ can any live forever; that
          death is a condition of unconsciousness for all persons until
          the resurrection at Christ's second coming, when the righteous
          will enter an endless life upon this earth, and the rest will
          suffer complete extinction of being; that this coming is near;
          that church government should be congregational; that immersion
          is the only true baptism; and that Sunday is the Christian
          Sabbath.

          Message, Yarmouth, Me., 1874.

          4. Life and Advent Union: This may be said to have existed since
          1848, but it was not until 1862 that it was organized, at
          Wilbraham. Mass., under the leadership of Elder George Stores.
          Its organ is The Herald of Life and of the Corning Kingdom,
          published at Springfield, Mass., weekly since 1862. It holds
          that all hope of another life is through Jesus Christ, and that
          only believers in him, who have manifested in their daily lives
          the fruits of the Spirit, attain to the resurrection of the
          dead, which will take place at Christ's coming, and that such
          coming will be personal, visible, and literal, and is impending.
          The Union holds four camp-meetings annually: two in Maine, one
          in Connecticut, which is the principal one, and one in Virginia.

          5. Church of God: This is a branch of the Seventh-day
          Adventists, which seceded in 1866 because its members denied
          that Mrs. Ellen Gould White was an inspired prophetess. Their
          organ is The Bible Advocate and Herald of the Coming Kingdom,
          published at Stanberry, Mo., which is their center. Like the
          parent body, the Church of God has tithes, sanatoriums, and a
          publishing house.

          on Wednesday, and his Resurrection on Saturday.

          6. Churches of God in Christ Jesus, popularly known as the
          Age-to-come Adventists: These have existed since 1851, when
          their organ, The Restitution (Plymouth, Ind.), was established,
          but they were not organized till 1888, when the general
          conference was formed. They believe in the restoration of
          Israel, the literal resurrection of the dead, the
          immortalization of the righteous, and the final destruction of
          the wicked, eternal life being through Christ alone.

   Advertisements of Elizabeth
          ADVERTISEMENTS OF ELIZABETH: Name commonly applied to the
          regulations promulgated in 1566 by Matthew Parker, archbishop of
          Canterbury, for the purpose, as alleged, of securing uniformity
          and decency in public worship, against the tendencies of the
          extreme Protestant party (see [107]Puritans, Puritanism, § 6).
          It is now generally admitted that, though they represented
          Elizabeth's policy in ritual matters, they never received her
          formal sanction. They assumed some importance in the ritual
          controversies of the nineteenth century, the High-church party
          contending that they were merely an archiepiscopal injunction
          enforcing an irreducible minimum of ritual, while their
          opponents attempted to show that they were a legal prescription
          of a positive kind, which made the surplice the only lawful
          vestment of the clergy in parish churches.

   Advocate of The Church
          ADVOCATE OF THE CHURCH (Lat. Advocatus or Defensor Ecclesiæ): An
          officer charged with the secular affairs of an ecclesiastical
          establishment, more especially its defense, legal or armed. The
          beginnings of the office appear in the Roman empire. From the
          end of the fifth century there were defensores in Italy, charged
          with the protection of the poor and orphans as well as with the
          care of Church rights and property. In the Merovingian kingdom
          legal representatives of the churches had the title. In the
          Carlovingian period, in accordance with the effort to keep the
          clergy as far as possible from worldly affairs, bishops, abbots,
          and other ecclesiastics were required to have such an official.
          The development of the law of immunity made such advocati
          necessary--on the one hand, to uphold Church rights against the
          State and in court, on the other hand to perform judicial and
          police duties in ecclesiastical territory. The Carlovingian
          kings had the right of appointment, but sometimes waived it in
          individual cases. These officers were at first generally
          clerics, later laymen, and finally the office became hereditary.
          Often this advocate of the Church developed into a tyrant,
          keeping the establishment in absolute submission, despoiling and
          plundering it. He usurped the whole power of administration,
          limited the authority of the bishop to purely spiritual affairs,
          absorbed the tithes and all other revenues, and doled out to the
          clergy a mean modicum only. Innocent III. (1198-1216), however,
          succeeded in checking the growing importance of this
          institution, and soon the office itself disappeared.

   Advocates, Consistorial
          ADVOCATES, CONSISTORIAL: Twelve lawyers who outrank all the
          advocates in the papal court. They trace their origin from the
          close of the sixth century, when Gregory the Great appointed
          seven defensores in the city of Rome to plead the cause of poor
          litigants who would otherwise be without legal counsel. Sixtus
          IV. increased the number by the addition of five junior
          advocates, but the memory of the historical origin of the body
          was preserved by reserving to the seven senior members certain
          privileges, among them the right to constitute the college
          proper of consistorial advocates. This college at the present
          time is made up of two clerics and five laymen, one of the
          latter being dean. The name "consistorial" comes from the fact
          that their principal duties--presenting the claims of candidates
          for canonization and petitioning for the pallium--are performed
          in papal consistories.

   Advocates of St. Peter
          ADVOCATES OF ST. PETER: An association of Roman Catholic jurists
          formed on the occasion of the episcopal jubilee of Pius IX. in
          1876, for the purpose of asserting and vindicating the rights
          and teaching of the Church and of the Holy See. The
          organization, which was blessed by Pius IX., received a signal
          mark of approbation from Leo XIII. in 1878, when its
          constitution was approved in a papal brief. From Rome, where its
          headquarters were established, it has spread into all the
          countries of Europe, but is unknown in the United States.

   Advowson
          ADVOWSON: In the Church of England, the right of nomination to a
          vacant ecclesiastical benefice, vested in the crown, the bishop,
          one of the universities, or a private person. Such nomination,
          or presentation, as it is called, is the rule in England,
          election by the congregation being almost unknown.

   Ædituus
          ÆDITUUS, î-dit´u-us: A term applied to a person having the care
          of ecclesiastical property. Among the Romans it described one
          who, with the local priest, if there was one, had charge of a
          temple. The Roman customs in regard to this office had their
          influence on the development of similar functions in the
          Christian Church. They were at first discharged by the
          [109]ostiarius, to whom the term ædituus was sometimes applied
          (cf. Paulinus of Nola, Epist., i.). By degrees, as the major and
          minor orders developed, and Church property became more
          valuable, permanent subordinate officials were required to look
          after it. The functions and designations of these officials
          varied, however, in different provinces. The name ædituus fell
          into disuse, probably from its original association with heathen
          worship. It was employed in the Vulgate version of Ezek. xliv.
          11; Hos. x. 5; Zeph. i. 4; and Durand (Rationale, ii. 5) says of
          the ostiarii that their functions resemble those of the æditui.
          In the Middle Ages the execution of the less dignified
          functions, which were thought incompatible with the clerical
          office, was committed more and more to subordinates, and by the
          end of that period almost entirely to laymen. The name ædituus
          was still used for these officials, being thus equivalent to the
          later sacristan. But this was principally in central Europe,
          especially in Germany, where conciliar decrees show that their
          duty was to ring the bells, to open and close the church, etc.
          In the more western countries the æditui became rather
          identified with the [110]procuratores or [111]provisores who had
          charge of the ecclesiastical property, though this included in
          some degree the maintenance of the building and the provision of
          vestments, candles, incense, and the like. In America during the
          nineteenth century the name has been not infrequently employed
          in Roman Catholic ecclesiastical terminology for the trustees
          who administer the temporal concerns of a parish.

   Aegidius de Columna
          ÆGIDIUS DE COLUMNA (Egidio Colonna): A pupil of Thomas Aquinas
          and reputed author of the bull Unam sanctam; b. at Rome 1245
          (?); d. at Avignon 1316. He joined the Augustinian eremite
          monks, studied at Paris, and taught there for many years, being
          called Doctor fundatissimus. From 1292 to 1295 he was general of
          his order. In 1296 he was made archbishop of Bourges, but
          continued to reside in Rome. He defended the election of
          Boniface VIII. in his De renuntiatione papæ, showing that the
          abdication of Celestine V. was not against the canon law, and
          followed the court to Avignon. His numerous writings (mostly
          unpublished) deal with philosophy (commentaries on Aristotle),
          exegesis (In Canticum Canticorum; In epistolam ad Romanos), and
          dogmatics (In sententias Longobardi; Quodlibeta). A portion of
          his work on ecclesiastical polity, De potestate ecclesiastica,
          was published in the Journal de l'instruction publique (Paris,
          1858).

          (Conciliorum collectio, vol. ix., Paris, 1715, p. 1576), and a
          memorial on the condition of the Church, which he presented to
          Pope Adrian VI., was published by C. Höfler (in the Abhandlungen
          of the Royal Bavarian Academy, hist. cl., iv., Munich, 1846, pp.
          62-89).

   Aeneas of Gaza
          ÆNEAS, î-nî´?s, OF GAZA, gê´z?: A pupil of the Neoplatonist
          Hierocles at Alexandria, and teacher of rhetoric at Gaza. Before
          534 he wrote a dialogue, Theophrastus (in MPG, lxxxv.
          865--1004), in which he opposes the doctrine of the preexistence
          of the soul, but asserts its immortality and the resurrection of
          the body; the perpetuity of the world is rejected. Twenty-five
          of his letters may be found in R. Hercher, Epistolographi Græci,
          pp. 24-32, Paris, 1873, and several of his treatises are in M.
          de la Bigne, Bibliotheca veterum patrum, viii. (8 vols., Paris,

   Aeneas of Paris
          ÆNEAS OF PARIS: Bishop of Paris 858-870; d. Dec. 27, 870. He is
          best known as the author of one of the controversial treatises
          against the Greeks called forth by the encyclical letters of
          Photius. His comprehensive Liber adversus Græcos (in D'Achery,
          Spicilegum, Paris, i., 1723, 113-148; MPL, cxxi. 681-762; cf.
          MGH, Epist., vi., 1902, p. 171, no. 22) deals with the
          procession of the Holy Ghost, the marriage of the clergy,
          fasting, the consignatio infantium, the clerical tonsure, the
          Roman primacy, and the elevation of deacons to the see of Rome.
          He declares that the accusations brought by the Greeks against
          the Latins are "superfluous questions having more relation to
          secular matters than to spiritual." [The work is mainly a
          collection of quotations or "sentences," from Greek and Latin
          Fathers, the former translated.]

   Aepinus, Johannes
          ÆPINUS, ê-pî´nus, JOHANNES (Johann Hoeck): The first Lutheran
          superintendent of Hamburg; b. at Ziesar or Ziegesar (29 m.
          e.n.e. of Magdeburg), in the march of Brandenburg, 1499; d. in
          Hamburg May 13, 1553. He was a diligent student as a boy, and
          was under Bugenhagen's instruction, probably while the latter
          was rector of the monastery of Belbuck. He took his bachelor's
          degree at Wittenberg in 1520; here he became the friend of
          Luther and Melanchthon. Then he had a school in Brandenburg, but
          was persecuted and imprisoned for his reforming activity, and
          had to leave home. Partly on account of the malice of his
          enemies, he adopted the modified form of the Greek word aipeinos
          ("lofty"), by which he is generally known, and which he claimed
          was a translation of his real name (Hoeck = hoch). He spent some
          time in Pomerania, in close relations with the leaders of the
          Reformation there. From about 1524 to 1528 he was in Stralsund,
          in charge of a school (probably private). The local authorities
          asked him to draw up an order of ecclesiastical discipline
          (Kirchenordnung), which went into effect Nov. 5, 1525. In Oct.,
          1529, he succeeded Johann Boldewan as pastor of St. Peter's in
          Hamburg. He carried on vigorously the work of his teacher and
          friend, Bugenhagen, and was chiefly instrumental in introducing
          his order of discipline in Hamburg. His contest with the
          cathedral chapter, which still adhered to the old faith, gave
          occasion to the earliest of his extant writings, Pinacidion de
          Romanæ ecclesiæ imposturis (1530). On May 18, 1532 he was
          appointed to the highest office in the Lutheran Church of
          Hamburg, that of superintendent according to Bugenhagen's order
          of discipline. In 1534 he visited England at the request of
          Henry VIII., to advise him as to his divorce and as to the
          carrying forward of the Reformation there. He returned to
          Hamburg in the following January, and subsequently made numerous
          journeys as a representative of the city in important affairs.
          He took part in all the church movements of the time, and
          frequently had the deciding voice in disputed matters.
          Melanchthon considered his work on the interim (1548) the best
          that had been written, though it did not agree with his own
          views.

          In all his writings Æpinus displays great theological learning
          and equal gentleness of temper. He gave weekly theological
          lectures, usually in Latin, which were attended by the preachers
          and other learned men, and spent much time on the Psalms, taking
          up especially the questions which at the moment were agitating
          men's minds. He is best known by the controversy which arose
          over his teaching as to the descent of Christ into Hades. In
          1542, finding that the article of the creed on this subject was
          frequently explained as meaning no more than the going down into
          the grave, in his lecture on the sixteenth psalm, he put forward
          the view, already given in Luther's explanation of the Psalms,
          that Christ had really gone down into hell, to deliver men from
          its power. Garcæus, his successor at St. Peter's, called him to
          account for this teaching, but left Hamburg in the following
          year and did not return until 1546. Meantime Æpinus's commentary
          on Ps. xvi. had been published by his assistant Johann Freder,
          so that his view was widely known.

          The controversy became a public and a bitter one after Garcæus's
          return, and both sides sought to gain support from Wittenberg.
          Melanchthon could only say that there was no agreement among the
          doctors on this point, and counsel peace. Æpinus's opponents in
          Hamburg were so turbulent that their leaders were deprived of
          their offices and banished from the city in 1551. The principal
          monument of Æpinus's activity in Hamburg is his ordinances for
          the church there, which he drew up in 1539 at the request of the
          council. It was a necessary amplification of that of Bugenhagen,
          and seems to have remained in force until 1603.

          strangers, maimed, and incapable, in Sebaste in Pontus in the
          fourth century. He was one of the progressive men of the time
          who protested against the legalistic and hierarchic tendencies
          of the Church. Supporting his contention by the Scriptures, he
          objected to the inequality of presbyters and bishops, denied the
          value of prayers for the dead, and opposed strict ordinances
          concerning fasting, which he wished to leave more to individual
          judgment. About 360 he resigned his position. He had many
          followers, who constituted a party of "Aerians"; they were
          severely persecuted and soon disappeared. The only source is
          Epiphanius (Hær., lxxv.; cf. Gieseler, Church History, i.,
          section 106, note 3), who treats him in a very partizan spirit.

   Affre, Denis Auguste
          AFFRE, DENIS AUGUSTE: Archbishop of Paris; b. at St. Rome de
          Tarn (55 m. n.w. of Montpellier), Aveyron, France, Sept. 27,
          1793; d. at Paris June 27, 1848. He studied at the Seminary of
          St. Sulpice and taught theology there after having been ordained
          priest (1818); he became vicar-general of the diocese of Luçon
          1821, of Amiens 1823, of Paris 1834, archbishop of Paris 1840.
          As archbishop he was zealous and faithful, and lost his life in
          the performance of duty. During the revolution of 1848, hoping
          to induce the insurgents to lay down their arms, he mounted a
          barricade at the Faubourg St. Antoine and attempted to address
          the mob, but had hardly begun to speak when he was struck by a
          musket ball and mortally wounded. He was one of the founders of
          La France chrétienne (1820), wrote much for it and other
          periodicals, and published several treatises of value on
          educational, historical, and religious subjects.

   Afra, Saint
          AFRA, SAINT: An early female martyr, concerning whom all that
          can be confidently asserted is that she suffered at Augsburg.
          This fact is attested by Venantius Fortunatus (Vita Martini, iv.
          642-643) and the mention of her name in the older martyrologies,
          and there is no reason to question it since the importance of
          Augsburg makes the early introduction of Christianity there
          probable. Her Acta (ed. B. Krusch, MGH, Script., Rer. Merov.,
          iii., 1896, 41-64) consist of two independent parts, Conversio
          and Passio, of which the latter is the older. It is said that
          she was dedicated by her mother to the service of Venus and
          lived an immoral life in Augsburg until she was converted by a
          bishop and deacon, who, in time of persecution, took refuge in
          her house, not knowing her character. She boldly confessed her
          faith in a general onslaught on the Christians and died by fire
          Aug. 5.

I. The Continent as a Whole:

  1. Geographical Description:

          Africa extends southward from the Mediterranean Sea nearly 5,000
          miles. The equator crosses it nearly in the middle of its
          length; but by far the greater part of its mass lies north of
          the equator, the breadth of the continent from Cape Verde to
          Cape Guardafui being about 4,600 miles. Its area is about
          11,500,000 sq. miles; and the adjacent islands add to this
          239,000 more. Easily accessible to Europe by the Mediterranean
          Sea through 2,000 miles of its northern coast, and touching Asia
          at the Isthmus of Suez, this continent has ever invited
          investigation, and has received notable influences from both of
          its active neighbors. The Sahara Desert, however, severing the
          Mediterranean coast regions from the southern and equatorial
          regions of the continent, has proved for centuries a bar to
          extended intercourse. "Had it not been for the River Nile," says
          Sir H. H. Johnston, "the negro and the Caucasian might have
          existed apart even longer without coming into contact." In fact,
          the great rivers of Africa are quite as important as aide to
          foreign intercourse in these days as the Desert has been an
          obstruction to it in the past. The greatest of the African
          rivers are the Nile, the Kongo, the Niger, and the Zambesi.
          Closely connected with the rivers, again, are the great lakes of
          central Africa, namely, Victoria, Tanganyika, and Nyassa, which
          belong, respectively, to the Nile, the Kongo, and the Zambesi
          systems. A further characteristic of the continent, noteworthy
          for all who seek entrance to its interior districts, is the
          insalubrity, one might say the deadliness, of the climate of its
          coasts both east and west throughout its tropical zone. The
          low-lying coast regions, extending in some cases 200 miles
          inland are sown with the graves of white men, germs of strange
          and fatal fevers lying in wait as it were for all strangers who
          venture to set foot unprepared upon that black and seething
          soil. The greatest mountains of Africa are all in its east
          central section. Kilimanjaro in German East Africa, east of the
          Victoria Nyanza, is 19,600 feet high; Mweru, close by, is about
          16,000 feet; and Ruwenzori, west of the Victoria Nyanza and on
          the border of the Kongo Independent State, is over 20,000 feet.
          Among the high lands of the interior the most notable section is
          a broad causeway of elevated plateaux which stretches from
          Abyssinia southward almost to Cape Colony, and which offers to
          the white man an almost ideal residence at a height of from
          5,000 to 6,000 feet through a long range that is hardly broken
          save by the Zambesi River.

  2. The Races of Africa:

          The puzzle of the races in Africa which the casual visitor
          classes under the comprehensive term negroes is insoluble at
          this day. But the key to the puzzle may probably be found in the
          repeated mingling of Asiatic and European blood in varying
          degrees and at divers distinct epochs with the blood of the
          African of the projecting jaw and the woolly locks. The history
          of Africa is practically the history of Egypt and then of her
          Carthaginian rival until well toward the Christian era. Only
          then did the Mediterranean coast of North Africa begin to have a
          tale of its own. The mention of this is significant; it suggests
          the repeated entrance of Asiatica into Africa through the whole
          period when Egypt was a world power, and of various sorts of
          Europeans into North Africa during a thousand years before the
          Mohammedan era.

          The races now inhabiting Africa are a perpetual subject of
          discussion and theory because of the difficulty of accounting
          for the resemblances as well as the differences between them.
          Along the Mediterranean coast of North Africa the Arab race
          rules; but in all the countries of this coast from the west
          frontier of Egypt to the Atlantic Ocean the Berber race forms
          the larger part of the population, and even extends into the
          Sahara. A little further south, negroes of a low and degraded
          type are found on the west of the Nile; and they appear at
          different points throughout the continent as far west as the
          Atlantic coast. In Egypt the larger part of the population is a
          mixture of Arabs with the ancient Egyptian race, commonly
          classed as Hamites. This name distinguishes this people from the
          Semitic races, without throwing light on their origin. Arabs
          appear also at intervals along the coast of East Africa as far
          south as Portuguese East Africa in considerable numbers. In the
          northern section of this coast, along with the Arabs is found a
          race of negroes commonly called Nubians, the result apparently
          of mixtures of Arab, Egyptian, and negro races. Abyssinia, the
          Somali coast, and the Galla country contain a large block of
          people of the Hamite race, divided into groups, however, by
          language as well as by religion. Along the Upper Nile as far as
          the borders of Uganda and eastward well toward the coast are
          found tribes of another type of negroes generally called the
          Nilotic group. The negroes of the western part of Africa north
          of the equator are not all of the degraded type that appears
          along the western coast. The Fulahs are of an entirely different
          race, resembling the Hamites, excepting in language. The
          Mandingoes of the interior of Sierra Leone, Liberia, and the
          Ivory Coast, are also of a higher type, although their languages
          show no traces of northern or Asiatic influence.

          Throughout Africa north of the equator small detached bodies of
          Arabs are found at different points; and in general the
          religious control of this whole great region is with the
          Mohammedans. For this reason north Africa is frequently spoken
          of as "Mohammedan Africa." It should be borne in mind,
          nevertheless, that throughout the region, many pagan tribes
          exist under Mohammedan rulers. South of the equator, generally
          speaking, the inhabitants of central Africa, and indeed to the
          borders of Cape Colony, are of the Bantu stock, often warlike
          and of a much higher type of intelligence than the negroes of
          the western coast. In the southwestern part of the continent are
          remnants of the Hottentots and Bushmen, once numerous in Cape
          Colony, while throughout Cape Colony proper the natives are
          known as "colored people," and represent a residue of mixtures
          of races during centuries. A considerable number of Dutch and of
          British are found in South Africa; and Portuguese, as well as
          many Portuguese half-breeds, are numerous in Angola and
          Portuguese East Africa. European colonists are slowly entering
          the country on all sides and from all nations, but more than
          half of the continent can never be a fit residence for Europeans
          and must remain in the hands of the negro races.

          This mixture of races stands in the place of a historical record
          concerning the people of Africa. Neither the Africans nor any
          others can read the record. It is the misfortune of the people
          of this continent to have no history except as appendages to the
          outside world; and the whole mass of allusions to them in
          ancient history has the vague quality of tradition. Even the
          Roman records lack precision, and remain generalities which
          throw little light on the history of the actual people of the
          continent.

3. The Opening of Africa:

  1. The Arabs and Portuguese.

          The Mohammedan conquest, beginning about 640, added little to
          knowledge of the continent, although the Arabs in time gave to
          the rest of the world information about the fertile negro land
          beyond the desert in the unlimited region to which they gave the
          name Sudan, "the Country of the Blacks." Eight hundred years
          later the Portuguese undertook a wonderful series of
          explorations of the African coasts, which between 1446 and 1510
          began the process of stamping the continent as a possession of
          Europe. Portugal named every important feature of the African
          coast as though she owned the whole continent, which in fact she
          did as far as the coasts were concerned. She ruled the west
          coast and the Cape of Good Hope from Lisbon, and the east coast,
          as a part of India, from Goa; and there were none but the Arabs
          to dispute her sway. She introduced missions also into her
          African possessions. But, after the fashion of the times, a
          mission had no objections to raise against maltreatment of the
          people to whom the land belonged.

  2. The General European Invasion.

          At last in the seventeenth century began what may be called the
          third period of the opening of Africa, the Arab invasion and the
          Portuguese occupation having been the first and second. The
          characteristic of this third period was a rush by every European
          nation that could handle ships to make the most money possible
          out of a vast territory whose inhabitants had not the ability to
          object. The Dutch took the Cape of Good Hope; and the British,
          the French, and the Spaniards all gained foothold in different
          parts of the western coast, and imprinted the nature of their
          enterprises upon the region by names which persist to this day;
          such as the "Gold Coast," the "Ivory Coast," the "Grain [of
          Paradise] Coast" and the "Slave Coast." When the slave-trade
          began, in the seventeenth century, the Germans, the Swedes, and
          the Danes also made haste to acquire territory whence they could
          despoil the continent. North Africa, however, remained in the
          fierce grip of Islam. The history of Africa was still a history
          of outsiders working their will upon the country. At the end of
          the eighteenth century the nations of the lesser European powers
          had all been dispossessed. Portugal held to her ancient
          acquisitions about the mouths of the Kongo and the Zambesi and
          began to try to discover what lay back of these; Great Britain
          had replaced the Dutch at the Cape of Good Hope, thus securing
          an extensive region in which white men could live and thrive;
          while France and Spain had some small settlements on the
          northern part of the west coast of the continent.

          The slave-trade, during nearly 200 years as far as Europe is
          concerned, and during uncounted centuries as concerns the
          Asiatic countries, sums up history for the African people. They
          know little else of their past; but they know that. That fearful
          traffic transported Africa westward, until from the Ohio River
          in the United States away southward to the valley of the Amazon
          in Brazil and throughout the West Indies, the population became
          strongly and often predominantly African.

  3. Prohibition of the Slave-Trade.

          A fourth era begins for Africa with the prohibition of the
          slave-trade by Denmark, Great Britain, Holland, France, and
          Sweden (1792-1819). It was the slave-trade and its horrors which
          turned Protestant missionary activity toward Africa in the
          earliest days of the nineteenth century; and it was the
          discussion which preceded the prohibition of slave-trading which
          suggested the beginning of a systematic exploration of Africa.

  4. Later Explorations and the Partition of Africa.

          A fifth period of African history is that of effective
          exploration of the interior by Europeans between 1840 and 1875.
          In this period the missionary Livingstone preceded Stanley. But
          Stanley, following Burton and Speke and Grant and Cameron, and
          seeking to find Livingstone, turned the attention of the world
          to the vast commercial value of Africa. A sixth period is the
          period of partition, beginning when Great Britain, after taking
          possession of many of the best territories in the southern part
          of the continent, occupied Egypt in 1882. In the eager rush of
          the European powers which followed, the great continent, has
          been parceled out as a gold-field is parceled out by prospectors
          who protect by men with guns the stakes they have hastily driven
          into the soil, and who only then sit down to estimate the value
          of what they have secured in the scramble. So to the present day
          the history of Africa is a history of what outsiders have done
          in the continent rather than of what the people of the country
          have done or thought or planned.

4. Religion and Missions:

  1. Native Religions.

          A rapid survey of the modern political divisions of Africa will
          be given under the name of each. It seems well, however, to make
          here a few general remarks upon some religious and social
          peculiarities of the people of the continent as a whole. The
          religion of Africa in its untouched and natural condition is not
          properly idolatrous. There is almost always some sense of a
          supreme being, who is a spirit, and from whom all power has
          originally proceeded. The actual religious observances of the
          people, however, except where they have been affected by
          Mohammedanism or by Christianity, are forms of spirit-worship
          connected with the use of fetishes (see [116]Fetishism).

  2. Mohammedanism.

          Mohammedanism has become an indigenous religion in Africa. It
          rules absolutely the religious thought of nine-tenths of the
          people of the northern parts of the continent, and controls in a
          less degree millions south of the Sahara from the Nile to the
          Niger. As a civilizing force Mohammedanism has value. The first
          thing the awakened negro does under Mohammedan influence is to
          obtain a decent robe wherewith to cover himself. Islam wherever
          it goes ends cannibalism. Its scheme of religious motive in life
          is to commend religion by making it "easy" to those who find
          restraint hard. It teaches a certain proportion of the people to
          recite Arabic litanies of praise to God, and to read Arabic; but
          to the great mass of the negroes its effect includes neither
          knowledge of Arabic nor information on the dogmas of Islam. It
          encourages war in a positive and very real sense; its
          slave-raids know no amelioration through the change from the
          tenth to the twentieth century; and they are barely less
          brutalizing than the man-eating raids which they have displaced.
          The weakness of Mohammedanism as a civilizing force is that it
          can not raise men to a level higher than the old Arabian
          civilization which it is proud to represent. And it is a fact of
          the deepest meaning, from the missionary point of view, that
          negroes who have become Mohammedans are equipped with an
          assurance of righteousness and knowledge which makes them almost
          impervious to Christian instruction.

  3. Protestant Missions.

          The Protestant missions, on the other hand, bring to their
          converts the Christian civilization of the twentieth century
          with its blessings and enlightenment. The belief that the
          commonest man will be elevated by study of the Bible, makes the
          literary culture of African languages a first principle in every
          mission. More than 100 of the tribal dialects have been reduced
          to writing, and have been given an elementary Biblical study
          apparatus which improves as the capacity of the people develops.
          In the process the language itself becomes in some degree
          purified, and its words enriched by more profound meanings,
          until the language receives power to express feelings. In South
          Africa hundreds of native Protestant churches lead independent
          ecclesiastical lives under native pastors. It is perhaps too
          soon to claim that anything is proved by the moderate successes
          of a century of Protestant missions; but at least it is not out
          of place to emphasize the wide difference of aim between the two
          great branches of the Christian Church now working for the
          regeneration of the tribes of Africa.

  4. Colonists and Missions.

          African missions encounter difficulty from the European
          colonists. Their aim is quite different from that of the
          colonists. This alone would make friction and mutual opposition
          probable. But the aim of the colonist is sometimes aggressively
          opposed to that of the missionary. That aim was frankly stated
          by the German Koloniale Zeitschrift early in 1904 as follows:
          "We have acquired this colony not for the evangelization of the
          blacks, not primarily for their well-being, but for us whites.
          Whoever hinders our object must be put out of the way." Such
          assumption of the right of might is found not only in German
          Southwest Africa; but in the Portuguese colonies, where the
          slave trade is still brutally active; in some of the French
          colonies, where the cruelties of the local administration broke
          De Brazza's heart; and in the Kongo Independent State, where
          mutilations and other cruelties mark the Belgian rubber trade
          and are glossed over by the assurance that the cutting off of
          hands is an old native custom. The same spirit often appears in
          British colonies in Africa, but there it is repressed by the
          government. Where the colonist acts on the "might is right"
          principle the missionary works a stony soil.

  5. The "Ethiopian Movement."

          The colonist has had occasion from the very beginning of
          missions in Africa to complain that one effect of them is to
          make the people self-assertive. This is not a fault, provided
          the self-assertion does not pass the limits of mutual right.
          During the last five or six years a movement among the native
          Christians of South Africa has attracted much attention. It is
          what is known as the "Ethiopian movement." Its watchword is
          "Africa for the Africans"; and its aim is to place all African
          churches under strictly African leadership. There is a political
          sound in some of the utterances of the "Ethiopian" leaders; and
          the local governments are on the alert to check any developments
          along that line, more especially since American Africans have
          taken a hand in the movement. There appears to be some
          connection between this movement and the revolt of the tribes in
          the south of German Southwest Africa. Whatever the final
          outcome, it appears certain that as the African tribes learn to
          think for themselves they must assert their manhood; and,
          however foolish and futile some of the manifestations of this
          growing manhood may be, the fact itself is a token that ought to
          be welcomed. Through it Africa may yet have a history of its
          own.

II. The Political Divisions of Africa:

          Abyssinia: The only Christian country of Africa which resisted
          the Mohammedan irruption. It consists for the most part of a
          mountain knot in which rise the Atbara River and the Blue Nile,
          and lies between the Egyptian Sudan and the Red Sea. Area about
          150,000 sq. miles; population about 3,500,000; religion, a
          debased form of the Coptic Church with over 3,000,000 adherents.
          There are also between 60,000 and 100,000 Jews (called Falashas,
          "exiles"), and about 50,000 Mohammedans, besides 300,000 pagans.
          The prevailing language is the Amharic with dialects in
          different sections. The sacred books of the church are in
          Ethiopic or Geez. The Gallas in the south have a language of
          their own. In 1490 Portuguese explorers introduced the Roman
          Catholic religion into Abyssinia. In 1604 a Jesuit mission was
          established which finally won the adhesion of the emperor.
          Intrigues led to their expulsion after about thirty years. The
          Carmelites and Augustinians also engaged in the work, but with
          no lasting results; the mission was entirely abandoned in 1797.
          All attempts to reestablish Roman Catholic missions were
          thwarted until the early part of the nineteenth century. The
          Lazarists succeeded about 1830 in gaining a foothold in various
          provinces. They were again expelled from the interior provinces,
          and now have their headquarters in the Italian territory of
          Eritrea (see below). A strong missionary advance into Harrar is
          also being made from Jibuti.

          The earliest effort to establish a Protestant mission in
          Abyssinia was that of Peter Heyling, a law student of Lübeck. He
          went there in 1640, won favor with the Abyssinian court circles,
          and began to translate the Bible into colloquial Amharic. He was
          captured by Turks in 1652, and, refusing to become a Mohammedan,
          was decapitated, leaving no trace of his work. In 1752 Christian
          Frederick William Hocker, a Moravian physician, began a
          persistent effort to establish a mission in Abyssinia. But the
          mission got no further than Egypt, and was recalled after the
          death of Hocker in 1782. In 1830 the Church Missionary Society
          established a mission in Abyssinia, which was broken up in 1838.
          Later the London Society for Promoting Christianity among the
          Jews sent missionaries to the Falashas. Suspicions of political
          designs hampered the missionaries; and in 1863 they were
          imprisoned by the emperor. A British military expedition stormed
          Magdala, the capital, in 1868 and freed the captives; but the
          mission was not again undertaken. In 1866 the Swedish National
          Missionary Society began a mission in the border of the province
          of Tigre, near Massowah. For fifteen years the mission made
          little progress, suffering through the hostility of the people
          and through attacks of disease. Then the earliest converts were
          baptized, the first a Galla slave, and next a Mohammedan. In
          1904 the society had ten stations in Eritrea (see below) and had
          succeeded in sending, with the consent of the authorities,
          native preachers into the southern Galla country west of Gojam.
          The Bible has a limited circulation in Abyssinia in several
          versions. The old Ethiopic Church version has been revised, and
          printed by the British Bible Society. The whole Bible has been
          translated into Amharic (1824), and into the southern Galla
          dialect (1898). The New Testament has been rendered (1830) into
          the Tigré dialect of the Geez, and single Gospels into Falasha,
          into two Galla dialects, and into Bogos. See [117]Abyssinia and
          the Abyssinian Church.

          Algeria: A French possession in northern Africa extending
          southward from the Mediterranean a somewhat uncertain distance
          into the Desert of Sahara. Area about 184,474 sq. miles;
          population about 4,739,000. The Algerian Sahara has about
          198,000 sq. miles in addition, with a population estimated at
          62,000. Although Algeria is regarded as a part of France, it
          still remains a Mohammedan country. The Mohammedan population is
          rather vaguely estimated at about 4,100,000, considerable
          uncertainty existing as to the number of inhabitants of the
          military district in the hinterland. The Christian population of
          Algeria is chiefly Roman Catholic (527,000). There are also
          about 25,000 Greeks, Armenians, and Copts, and about 30,000
          Protestants. The number of Jews is 57,000. The language of the
          country outside of the European colonies is Arabic with several
          dialects of the Berber language known here as Kabyle (i.e.
          "tribesman"). Algeria forms an archdiocese of the Roman Catholic
          Church, and is the seat of the Algerian Missionary Society
          organized through the energetic efforts of [118]Cardinal
          Lavigerie, for missionary enterprises on the edge of the Sahara
          and in Senegambia and other African districts as far south as
          Lake Tanganyika. Protestant missionary enterprises are
          represented in Algeria by the following: two French societies
          working among the Jews; Miss Trotter's educational mission; the
          Plymouth Brethren, who have ten missionaries in different cities
          in Algeria, but publish no statistics; a small Swedish mission;
          and the North Africa mission, which occupies four stations and
          carries on a number of small schools for Mohammedans. None of
          these missions has a very large following among the natives. In
          fact missionaries are not allowed by the French authorities to
          engage in open evangelization among Mohammedans. The Arabic
          version of the Bible has a limited circulation in Algeria. A
          colloquial version of some of the Gospels has been prepared for
          the use of the common people who have difficulty in
          understanding the classical Arabic. Some parts of the Bible have
          been translated into the Kabyle dialect; and this version, too,
          has a steady though small circulation. A painful historical
          interest attaches to the town of Bugia in Algeria as the scene
          of the martyrdom in 1315 of [119]Raymond Lully, the missionary
          to the Mohammedans.

          Angola: A colony of Portugal in West Africa, with a coast-line
          extending from the mouth of the Kongo River to the borders of
          German Southwest Africa. It extends into the interior to the
          Kongo Independent State. Area 484,000 sq. miles; population
          about 4,000,000, of whom 1,000,000 are rated as Roman Catholics.
          The Portuguese carried Roman Catholic missions to Angola in the
          last quarter of the fifteenth century, and a century later
          established a full ecclesiastical hierarchy in the old kingdom
          of Kongo, which lay on the left bank of the Kongo. Large numbers
          of the people of the old kingdom were converted to Christianity,
          even the king of the Kongo tribes being baptized in 1490. The
          residence of the king was at the place now known as San
          Salvador, in the northern part of Angola. This was the seat of
          the first Roman Catholic bishops. The residence of the bishop
          was afterward removed to St. Paul de Loanda on the coast, and
          the buildings at San Salvador fell into ruin as well as the
          human edifice of the Church in that region. During a hundred
          years or more the Church gave its blessing to the slave-trade,
          even the missionaries engaging in it and the bishop encouraging
          it. This confusion of missionary and mercantile enterprises
          perhaps accounts for the little progress made by early
          Christianity in Angola. The present Roman Catholic missionary
          force is in connection with the Congregation of the Holy Ghost
          and Sacred Heart of Mary, the mission being connected with the
          ecclesiastical province of Lisbon (Ulysippo).

          Protestant missions in Angola were commenced in 1879 by the
          Baptist Missionary Society of England, which occupied San
          Salvador and the northern part of the Loanda district as a part
          of its Kongo mission. The American Board opened a mission partly
          supported by Canadian Congregationalists, in the Benguela
          district in 1880. In 1882 the Livingstone Inland Mission
          (English) established a station, in connection with its Kongo
          mission, in Portuguese territory at Mukimvika on the left bank
          of the Kongo. This mission was turned over to the American
          Baptist Missionary Union two years later. In 1886 [120]Bishop
          William Taylor opened seven missionary stations in the district
          of Loanda, which are now carried on by the American Methodist
          Episcopal Church. The Plymouth Brethren also have a mission in
          Angola, and the Swiss Phil-African Mission under Heli Chatelain
          has a single station in Benguela, called Lincoln. All of these
          missions make use of education, industrial training, and medical
          aid to the suffering as instruments for evangelizing and
          elevating the people. Together these various Protestant missions
          report (1904) 65 missionaries (men and women), 142 native
          workers, 50 schools of all classes, 4,235 pupils, with about
          4,000 reputed Christians. These Protestant missions have the
          commendation of the higher and the secret execration of the
          lower Portuguese officials; they are also hampered by the open
          hostility of the Portuguese traders and colonists; but they are
          encouraged by the growing desire of the natives to learn to read
          and to be men. The native tribes of the interior are numerous,
          and often separated by barriers of language, although chiefly of
          Bantu stock. Parts of the Bible have been translated into the
          Kimbundu, and the Umbundu dialects, and printed respectively at
          the presses of the Methodist Episcopal and the American Board
          missions.

          Basutoland: A native protectorate in South Africa, governed by
          native chiefs under a British commissioner. It lies north of
          Cape Colony, with the Orange River Colony and Natal forming its
          other boundaries. Area 10,293 sq. miles; population (1904)
          348,500, of whom 900 are whites. No white colonists are admitted
          to this territory. The Basutos belong to the Bantu race; and
          their language is closely allied to the Zulu-Kafir language.
          About 300,000 of the people are pagans; about 40,000 are
          Protestant Christians; and about 5,000 are Roman Catholics. The
          capital of the territory is Maseru, where the British
          commissioner resides. The Protestant missions in Basutoland are
          maintained by the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, which
          entered the country under Rolland and Semue in 1833, and by the
          Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, which began its work
          in 1875. These two societies have about twenty-eight principal
          stations and more than 200 outstations with schools, seminaries,
          printing establishments, etc. The Roman Catholic missions are
          erected into a prefecture apostolic. They have 6,000 converts.
          The missions are carried on by Oblates of Mary the Immaculate.
          Statistics are difficult to obtain, since the reports do not
          separate work in Basutoland from that of the Orange River Colony
          and Griqualand. The Bible has been translated by Casalis and
          Mabille of the Paris mission into the language of the Basutos,
          generally spoken of as Suto or Leesuto (1837). There is also
          quite a Christian literature in the same language.

          Bechuanaland Protectorate: A British protectorate in South
          Africa; lying between the Molopo River and the Zambesi, with
          German Southwest Africa on the west, and Transvaal and Rhodesia
          on the east. Area 275,000 sq. miles much of it being desert;
          population (1904) 119,772, besides 1,000 whites. It is governed
          by native chiefs, Khama, Sebele, and Bathoen, each ruling his
          own tribe. The British commissioner, who supervises all, lives
          at Mafeking.

          The country is traversed by the railway leading from Cape Town
          northward. Among the regulations is one which forbids the
          granting of licenses to sell liquor. Somewhat over 100,000 of
          the people are pagans, and about 15,000 are Christians. The
          Bible has been translated into the language of the chief tribes,
          which is called Chuan or Sechuan (1831) and single Gospels into
          Matabele and Mashona. Roman Catholic missions in this territory
          are under the charge of the Jesuits connected with the Zambesi
          mission. Statistics are very difficult to obtain, but the Roman
          Catholic Church seems to have about 3,000 adherents. Protestant
          missions are carried on by the London Missionary Society, which
          extended its work to this territory in 1862, and by the
          Hermannsburg Missionary Society of Germany, which entered the
          territory in 1864. It is difficult to obtain the exact
          statistics of either of these societies, since the mission
          reports of both cover land beyond the borders of the
          Bechuanaland Protectorate. It is estimated, however, that the
          number of their adherents is not far from 12,000.

          British East Africa Protectorate: A territory under British
          control in the eastern part of Africa, including coast lands ten
          miles wide nominally belonging to Zanzibar. The protectorate
          extends inland to the borders of Uganda. Area about 200,000 sq.
          miles. While the coast regions are on the whole not healthful,
          there is a broad belt of highland 300 miles back from the coast
          which is most suitable for European habitation; and it was upon
          this belt of highland that the British government invited the
          Hebrew Zionists to establish a colony. A railway has been
          constructed from Mombasa to Kisumu on the Victoria Nyanza. The
          population is estimated at 4,000,000, of whom 500 are Europeans
          and about 25,000 Hindus, Chinese, Goanese, and other Asiatics.
          Many Arabs are found in the coast districts, especially in the
          northern part of the territory; and with them are the mixed race
          called by the Arabs Suahili ("coast people"). Inland the larger
          part of the population is of the Bantu race; but there are some
          powerful tribes like the Masai and Nandi who are of Nilotic
          stock. In the northern part of the country Gallas and Somalis
          are found. The capital, Mombasa, has had a checkered history. It
          was founded by the Arabs, who were in possession when the
          Portuguese arrived in 1498. The Portuguese continued in power
          with various vicissitudes until their colony was destroyed 200
          years later by the Arabs. The actual British acquisition of this
          territory dates from 1886 to 1890.

          Roman Catholic missions were established on this coast by the
          Portuguese in the fifteenth century, the stations being treated
          as an outlying district of the ecclesiastical province of Goa on
          the west coast of India. The missions followed the fortunes of
          the Portuguese occupation. They were reestablished in 1860 at
          Zanzibar. Protestant missions began with the arrival of Johann
          Ludwig Krapf, of the Church Missionary Society, in 1844. They
          were followed by the United Methodist Free Church in 1861, the
          Leipsic Missionary Society in 1886, the Neukirchen Missionary
          Institute in 1887, the Scandinavian Alliance Mission of North
          America in 1892, and the African Inland Mission, an American
          enterprise, in 1895. The Church of Scotland Foreign Missions
          Committee is preparing to enter the country also. All of these
          societies together report 172 missionaries, 92 stations and
          outstations with schools and hospitals, and about 11,000
          adherents. The languages of the tribes of this territory differ
          greatly from each other; and several versions of the Bible will
          have to be prepared for them. A beginning has been made in
          translating the Gospels into the Suahili, Nandi, Masai, Somali,
          and Galla languages.

          The islands of Zanzibar and Pemba, lying off the coast of German
          East Africa, politically belong to this territory. Area of the
          two islands 1,020 sq. miles; population 200,000, including
          10,000 East Indians and about 200 Europeans. Zanzibar has played
          an important part in the history of East and Central Africa
          since the beginning of the seventeenth century, when the region
          was occupied by Arabs of Muscat. It became a great center of
          African trade, including the slave-trade. The domains of the
          Sultan of Zanzibar extended along the whole coast from
          Mozambique nearly to the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb. Since the
          beginning of the nineteenth century the influence of Great
          Britain has been gradually increasing, and so leading up to the
          present protectorate. Germany obtained the southern part of the
          possessions of Zanzibar on the mainland; Italy bought in 1905
          its possession on the Somali coast; and a strip ten miles wide
          on the coast of British East Africa alone remains to the sultan
          of all his domains on the mainland, he himself being under the
          tutelage of a British official. Zanzibar is the seat of a Roman
          Catholic bishop, with missions conducted by the Congregation of
          the Holy Ghost, in both islands and on the mainland. The mission
          has about 3,500 adherents. There are ten stations. Schools and
          hospitals, conducted by Roman Catholic sisters, have been built
          in the city of Zanzibar. Protestant missions are represented by
          the Universities Mission which, after abandoning the Shiré
          country in 1861, moved its headquarters to the city of Zanzibar.
          Here Bishops William George Tozer, Edward Steere, and Charles
          Alan Smythies prepared the way for advance into the interior.
          The mission has a very fine cathedral and hospitals and schools
          in the island of Zanzibar, besides a line of stations on the
          mainland in German East Africa, which extends to Lake Nyassa.
          What has already been said of versions of the Bible in British
          East Africa applies to Zanzibar also. The city of Zanzibar
          itself is a Babel of all African nations and tribes.

          Cape Colony: A British colony occupying the southern part of the
          African continent; bounded on the north by German Southwest
          Africa, Bechuanaland, the Orange River Colony, Basutoland, and
          Natal. The colony was founded by the Dutch in 1652, was taken by
          the British in 1796, was again given up to Holland in 1803, was
          reoccupied by the British in 1806, and, finally, was ceded to
          Great Britain in 1814. Area (1904), including native states and
          Walfisch Bay on the coast of German Southwest Africa, 276,995
          sq. miles; population (1904) 2,405,552, of whom 580,380 are
          white, and 1,825,172 are colored. Of the colored population
          about 250,000 are a mixture of various races; 15,000 are Malays;
          and the rest are Hottentots, Kafirs, Fingoes, Bechuanas, etc.
          About 1,118,000 of the population are Protestants; 23,000 are
          Roman Catholics; 20,000 are Mohammedans; 4,000 are Jews; while
          1,226,000 are pagans. Roman Catholic missions were represented
          in the colony before the English occupation, by two priests
          riding in Cape Town. In 1806, when the British captured the
          colony, these priests were expelled. Sixteen years later two
          priests were again stationed at Cape Town, without liberty,
          however, to go into the surrounding country. The existing
          mission in the colony did not commence until 1837, when Raymond
          Griffith arrived. He had been an Irish Dominican monk, was
          appointed vicar apostolic and consecrated bishop by the
          Archbishop of Dublin, Aug. 24, 1837. Roman Catholic missions now
          occupy about 100 stations and outstations in the colony. There
          are two vicariates and a prefecture apostolic.

          Protestant Christians do not seem to have worked among the
          native population during the Dutch period. In 1737 the Moravian
          George Schmidt was sent to Cape Town, at the request of certain
          ministers in Holland, to try to benefit the Hottentots and the
          Bushmen. His success only served to anger the colonists; and he
          was sent back to Europe in 1742. Fifty years later, in 1792, the
          Moravians were permitted to reopen their mission in Cape Colony
          and it has been continued and expanded until the present time,
          now extending to the east and west. From 1822 to 1867 it had
          charge of the leper settlement at Hemel en Aarde and Robben
          Island. About 20,000 native Christians are connected with the
          Moravian mission. The London Missionary Society began a mission
          in Cape Colony in 1799 with Vanderkemp as its first missionary,
          and with such men as Moffat, Livingstone, Philip, and Mackenzie
          as his successors in a long and brilliant history which through
          many pains has added some 70,000 natives to the Christian body
          within the colony. The society has moved its missions northward
          into Bechuanaland and Rhodesia, one single station being still
          retained at Hankey in Cape Colony as an educational center. The
          Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society of England commenced a
          mission in the colony in the year 1814 with Barnabas Shaw as its
          first missionary. This mission afterward spread over the whole
          of the colony, and extended into Natal, Transvaal, Bechuanaland,
          and Rhodesia. The care of the native congregations within the
          colony now rests with the South African Methodist Church, which
          has connected with it native Christians to the number of
          113,600. The Glasgow Missionary Society in 1821 sent two
          missionaries into Kaffraria which has since been annexed to Cape
          Colony. The Scottish missions have been greatly extended and are
          now conducted under the United Free Church of Scotland, having
          given to missionary history such names as Ross and James
          Stewart, the latter called by the British High Commissioner "the
          biggest human" in the region. They extend through Kaffraria into
          Natal and have a native following of some 30,000. Their most
          prominent work is in the great educational establishments of
          Lovedale and Blythwood, which have tested and proved the ability
          of the Kafir-Zulu race to become civilized and useful. The
          Society for the Propagation of the Gospel began a mission in
          Cape Colony in 1821. This mission is now practically merged into
          the diocesan work of the Anglican Church which reports some
          20,000 baptized native Christians. The Paris Missionary Society
          felt its way into Basutoland from a station at Tulbagh (1830).
          The Berlin Missionary Society (1834) with 38 stations and 10,000
          adherents, and the Rheniah (1829) and the Hermannsburg (1854)
          missionary societies of Germany also have extensive and
          successful missions in Cape Colony. The African Methodist
          Episcopal Church, the National Baptist Convention, the
          Seventh-day Adventists, all from the United States, the Plymouth
          Brethren, and the Salvation Army are also engaged in missionary
          work at various points in this great colony.

          Among the achievements of missions must be reckoned the success
          of the Rev. Dr. John Philip of the London Missionary Society in
          securing attention on the part of the government to the
          infringement of ordinary rights of natives in the midst of a
          rush of colonists inclined to regard the natives as mere
          obstacles to be removed. Dr. Philip was calumniated and
          persecuted; but the authorities finally understood that
          righteous treatment of the blacks is a necessity to the
          prosperity of the colony. The appearance in recent years of the
          "Ethiopian movement" (see above, [121]I., 4, § 5) has aroused
          much suspicion; nevertheless, the authorities aim to secure
          justice to all, and more and more rely on missions to raise the
          moral standard of the negro community. See [122]Cape Colony.

          Central Africa Protectorate (British): A territory lying west
          and south of Lake Nyassa, and popularly called Nyassaland. Its
          southern portion includes the Shiré highlands and extends
          southward along the Shiré River as far as to the mouth of the
          Ruo. Area 40,980 sq. miles; population estimated at 990,000.
          Religion chiefly fetish-worship. About 300,000 of the people are
          Mohammedans, and about 18,000 are Christians. There is, however,
          no regular census, and these figures are mere estimates.
          Europeans living in the protectorate number about 500; and there
          are about 200 East Indians connected with the military
          establishment. The language of the Angoni hillmen is a dialect
          of Zulu; that of the lake people is in several dialects of which
          that known as Nyanja ("lake"), is becoming prevalent; that of
          the eastern part of the Shim district is Yao.

          Lake Nyassa was discovered by Dr. Livingstone in 1859. The
          country then was a select hunting-ground of Arab slave-raiders
          from Zanzibar and of the Portuguese from the Zambesi. Until
          1895, when the slave-raids were stopped by the British
          authorities, it is said that about 20,000 men, women, and
          children each year were seized and made to carry ivory to the
          coast. There they were sold along with the ivory which they had
          painfully borne for 500 miles. Into such an environment
          missionaries went at the instance of Livingstone, risking, and
          with disheartening frequency sacrificing, life because they
          believed that the people could be saved by teaching them the
          principles of manhood. The Arabs and the Yao savages were
          against them, the climate sapped their strength, and even wild
          beasts attacked them. Yet the missionaries won the day, with
          their Bible, their practical lessons in kindliness, and with
          their schools, their industrial training, and their high moral
          principles. The story of the founding of the protectorate is a
          story of heroism and of the power of the Bible which the devoted
          missionaries gave to a people whose very speech was illiterate.

          The Universities Mission, established at Livingstone's request,
          entered the Shiré territory under Bishop Charles Frederick
          Mackenzie in 1861. The hostility of the slave-raiders and the
          rigors of the climate broke up the mission for a time, but it is
          now thoroughly established at Likoma Island in Lake Nyassa, and
          in some sixty villages on the east shore of the lake and among
          the Yao tribesmen in the eastern part of the Shiré district. The
          Livingstonia Mission of the Free Church of Scotland, entered the
          country in 1875 and established its headquarters first at Cape
          Maclear at the south end of the lake, moving afterward to high
          land well toward the northern end of the lake, where the
          Livingstonia Institution now stands in a most salubrious spot
          overlooking the western shore. This mission has about 240
          stations and outstations. The schools, printing-house,
          hospitals, and industrial training establishments of this
          mission are noteworthy for completeness and beneficent influence
          quite as much as for their conquest of the chaos which existed
          when the missionaries arrived on the field. The Church of
          Scotland founded a mission in the Shiré highlands in 1876. The
          site was chosen because the missionaries were too ill and
          exhausted to go farther than the little group of native huts
          which seemed a haven of rest. Close by that miserable village
          has arisen about the mission the little town of Blantyre, whose
          post office is now a recognized station of the Universal Postal
          Union. This mission has about forty stations and outstations and
          a fine group of schools and hospitals. The Zambesi Industrial
          Mission has taken up a large tract of land lying to the
          northwest of Blantyre and is teaching the natives to cultivate
          coffee and other valuable crops. It has about thirty schools in
          connection with its various settlements. The South African
          (Dutch) Ministers' Union of Cape Town established a mission in
          1901 in the Angoni hill-country west of Lake Nyassa. It has
          seven stations and is winning favor among the people. All of
          these missions have been greatly aided by a commercial
          enterprise known as the African Lakes Corporation, formed in
          1878 by Scottish business men with the definite purpose of
          cooperating with the missions in civilizing the people of the
          protectorate. It has organized a regular steamboat service on
          the lake and the Shiré River to the coast at Chinde, and is at
          last on a paying business basis. The formal establishment of the
          British protectorate over the lake district took place in 1891.
          It is one of the marks of progress in the civilization of the
          tribes of the region that in 1904 a large section of the fierce
          Angoni tribe voluntarily accepted British control and British
          regulations. The missions named above have about 190
          missionaries (men and women), 985 native preachers and teachers,
          25,000 children in their schools, and about 16,000 professing
          Christians on their rolls. Several of the languages of the
          protectorate have been reduced to writing and the Bible is in
          process of publication in the Nyanja, several dialects of which,
          the Yao, the Konde, and the Tonga, are now being unified. The
          Angoni tribe, in the western part of the protectorate, being of
          Zulu race, are able to use the Zulu Bible, of which a
          considerable number of copies are brought from South Africa
          every year.

          Nyassaland is carried on the lists of the Roman Catholic Church
          as a provicariate confided to the care of the Algerian
          Missionary Society. But beyond 10 missionaries, 2 schools, and
          1,000 adherents little can be learned of the progress of the
          mission.

          Dahomey: A French possession in West Africa having a coast-line
          of seventy miles between Togoland and the British colony of
          Lagos, and extending northward to the French territory of
          Senegambia and the Niger. The French gained their first footing
          on this coast in 1851, Area 60,000 sq. miles; population
          estimated at about 1,000,000, commonly of unmixed negro stock.
          Capital, Porto Novo on the coast. About sixty miles of railway
          have been built and 400 miles are projected. It is worth noting
          that of the whole value of the annual imports into Dahomey
          one-fourth represents the liquor traffic. A Roman Catholic
          mission has existed for some years under the direction of the
          Lyons Seminary for Missions in Africa. There are twenty-two
          missionaries and fifteen schools. The number of the Roman
          Catholics in the mission is estimated at about 5,000. The only
          Protestant mission is that of the Wesleyan Missionary Society
          with a central station at Porto Novo. It has two missionaries
          who are of French nationality and it occupies ten outstations in
          the interior. The number of professing Protestant Christians is
          about 1,000.

          Egypt: A tributary province of the Turkish empire lying on the
          Mediterranean Sea east of Tripoli, and touching Arabia on the
          east at the Isthmus of Suez. Area (excluding the Sudan) about
          400,000 sq. miles, of which the Nile Valley and Delta,
          comprising the most of the cultivated and inhabited land, cover
          only about 13,000 sq. miles. The country is ruled by a
          hereditary prince called the Khedive, under British tutelage and
          control. Population (1897) 9,734,405. Capital, Cairo. The
          Mohammedan population of Egypt numbers about 8,979,000. Of the
          Christians 648,000 belong to the Oriental Churches, 608,000
          being connected with the Coptic or Old Egyptian Church. There
          are also 56,000 Roman Catholics and 27,000 Protestants. About
          25,000 of the population are Jews. The Roman Catholic
          establishments in Egypt date from the beginning of the
          seventeenth century, being at that time connected with the
          orders in charge of the holy places at Jerusalem. The present
          apostolic vicariate of Egypt was established in 1839. Roman
          Catholic missions in Egypt are under the minor Franciscan friars
          and the Lyons Seminary for Missions. There are also Lazarists,
          Jesuits, and Sisters of the Order of the Good Shepherd, Sisters
          of the Order of the Mother of God, Sisters of the Order of San
          Carlo Borromeo, and Sisters of Our Lady of Sion. There are about
          ninety schools, besides orphanages, hospitals, and other
          benevolent establishments. Protestant missions are carried on by
          the American United Presbyterian Mission (1854), the Church
          Missionary Society (in its present form 1882), the North Africa
          Mission, the Egypt General Mission, the Church of Scotland
          Committee on Missions to the Jews, the London Jews Society, the
          American Seventh-day Adventist Medical Missions, the (German)
          Sudan Pioneer Mission, and the (German) Deaconesses of
          Kaiserswerth (1857). The United Presbyterian Mission is the
          largest of these missions, occupying stations throughout the
          Nile Valley and in the Sudan. All together these missions report
          166 stations and outstations, 154 missionaries, with 515 native
          workers, 171 schools, with over 14,000 pupils and students, ten
          hospitals and dispensaries, two publishing houses, and about
          26,000 adherents. Under British control religious liberty is
          more or less assured. As a consequence Mohammedans are also
          included in small numbers among the mission converts. The Church
          Missionary Society's mission publishes a weekly paper in Arabic
          and English expressly for Mohammedans. The Bible in Arabic,
          translated and printed at the expense of the American Bible
          Society in Beirut, is circulated throughout Egypt, Arabic being
          the language of the people. See [123]Egypt.

          Eritrea: An Italian possession in Africa extending 670 miles
          along the coast of the Red Sea and inland to Abyssinia and the
          Egyptian Sudan. Area about 85,500 sq. miles; population
          (estimated) 450,000, of whom about 3,000 are Europeans. The
          capital is Asmara. The native population of Eritrea is chiefly
          nomadic. In religion more than 100,000 may be reckoned
          Mohammedans; 17,000, Roman Catholic; 12,000, of the Eastern
          Churches; 1,000, Protestants; and 500, Jews. The remainder of
          the population is pagan, belonging to different races. Roman
          Catholic missionaries have made this region a basis of
          operations in Abyssinia for nearly three centuries, having been
          expelled from Abyssinia proper a number of times. Their central
          establishments are now at Massowah (Massaua) and Keran, where
          they have a hospital, schools, and two or three orphanages.
          Protestant missions in Eritrea also directed toward the
          Abyssinian population are carried on by the Swedish National
          Society. They have 10 stations on the borders of Tigré and in
          the province formerly known as Bogos with about 15 schools, a
          hospital, a dispensary, and a small but growing band of
          evangelical Christians. The Swedish missions have done good
          service in securing a translation of the Bible into the Galla
          language (1898), and through trained native workers have
          succeeded in establishing themselves among the Galla people in
          the south of Abyssinia.

          French Guinea: A territory forming a part of the newly organized
          administrative region known as French West Africa. It lies on
          the coast between Portuguese Guinea and the British colony of
          Sierra Leone, extending inland some 400 miles to the district of
          Senegambia and the Niger. Area about 95,000 sq. miles;
          population estimated at 2,200,000. About 1,000,000 are
          Mohammedans; more than 1,000,000 are pagans; 1,000 are Roman
          Catholics, and 500 are Protestants. The capital is Konakry; from
          which place a railway is now under construction to the Niger
          River. French colonization in this district began as long ago as
          1685, but its development has only been of recent date (1843).
          The government is undertaking in this, as in all other parts of
          French West Africa, to introduce a uniform system of education.
          This, if carried out, will prove of inestimable advantage to the
          population. The Roman Catholic mission in French Guinea, is
          carried on by the Lyons Congregations of the Holy Ghost and of
          the Immaculate Heart of Mary. There are about 10 missionaries
          with 12 schools. A Protestant missionary enterprise, following
          one commenced in 1804 by the Church Missionary Society, is
          carried on in the Rio Pongas region by West Indian Christians
          aided by the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. The
          missionaries are colored men from the West Indies specially
          chosen for this work, which has been undertaken with the thought
          of making amends to Africa for the wrongs inflicted upon its
          people by England and her colonies. The New Testament has been
          translated into the Susu language (1858).

          French Kongo: A French colonial possession which occupies the
          west coast of Africa between the Spanish possessions of the Rio
          Muni on the borders of the Kongo Independent State and Kamerun,
          and which extends inland to Lake Chad. The French occupation
          began in 1841 in a small colony on the Gabun River. Its
          extension to the Kongo River followed the explorations of De
          Brazza, between 1875 and 1880. Area about 450,000 sq. miles;
          population estimated at from 8,000,000 upward. Capital,
          Libreville on the Gabun. Adjoining this territory in the Lake
          Chad region, Bagirmi, comprising some 20,000 sq. miles, and
          Wadai, with 170,000 sq. miles, in 1903 submitted to the French
          control. These two territories are strongly Mohammedan. French
          Kongo proper has about 3,500,000 Mohammedans in its northern
          sections, the remainder of the people being pagans of the usual
          African type. In race the people of the coast are not of the
          Bantu stock found in the interior.

          Roman Catholic missions are carried on by the Congregation of
          the Sacred Heart of Mary and the Algerian missionary order. The
          ecclesiastical center is Santa Maria on the Gabun, where is the
          vicariate, erected in 1842 under the name, at first, of "the
          apostolic vicariate of both Guineas." In the Roman Catholic
          mission there are about fifty priests and about thirty schools
          with about 5,000 adherents. Protestant missions were established
          in 1842 by missionaries of .the American Board. The mission was
          afterward transferred to the American Presbyterian Board
          (North), and later for political reasons the interior stations
          were passed over to the French missionaries of the Paris
          Evangelical Missionary Society. Together these two missions have
          23 missionaries and about 1,200 adherents. The languages having
          been reduced to writing by missionaries, the Bible has been
          translated into Mpongwe (1850-74) and Benga (1858-88), and
          various parts have been translated into Dikele, Fang (also
          called by the French Pahouin), Bulu, and Galwa.

          Gambia: A British colony and protectorate lying on both sides of
          the Gambia River, extending some 250 miles inland from its mouth
          and closely hemmed in by the French West African territory. The
          colony was commenced in 1662. Area, estimated (1903), 3,061 sq.
          miles; population, estimated (1903), 163,781; capital, Bathurst
          on the Island of Saint Mary. There are about 90,000 Mohammedans
          in the colony, 56,000 pagans, 4,000 Roman Catholics, and 2,000
          Protestant Christians. All of these figures, however, are
          estimates, excepting as to the colony proper. The Roman Catholic
          mission is under the care of the Lyons Seminary for Missions in
          Africa, and carries on two or three schools. The Protestant
          mission is carried on by the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary
          Society which entered the colony in 1821. It has 7 outstations,
          4 schools, and about 2,000 adherents in the colony. The Society
          of Friends established a mission in this colony in 1822, and
          schools were carried on by Hannah Kilham until her death in
          1832, when the mission was given up. The history of the
          Protestant missions here includes a very considerable loss of
          life among the missionaries, due to the unhealthfulness of the
          country. The Arabic Bible is used to a limited extent, and parts
          of the Bible have been translated also into the Wolof and
          Mandingo languages.

          German East Africa: A German colony and sphere of influence
          lying on the east coast of Africa, between British East Africa
          and Portuguese East Africa, and extending inland to Lakes Nyassa
          and Tanganyika. Area about 384,000 sq. miles; population
          (estimated) 7,000,000, including 1,437 Europeans. There are
          about 15,000 Arabs, Indians, Chinese, and other Asiatics in this
          territory. A railway has been built from Tanga on the coast
          about eighty miles inland to Korogwe; it is to be carried
          ultimately to Lake Tanganyika. In religion the people of the
          country are: pagans, about 6,500,000; Mohammedans, for the most
          part near the coast, 300,000; Hindus, Buddhists, etc., 12,000;
          Roman Catholics, 20,000; Protestants, 7,000. Roman Catholic
          missions are carried on by the Congregation of the Holy Ghost,
          the Trappists, the Benedictines, and the Algerian Missionary
          Society. They have extensive establishments about the northern
          and eastern shores of Lake Tanganyika, and report 58 stations,
          195 missionaries, 77 nuns, and 295 schools with 17,823 scholars.
          It is possible that a part of the figures here given refer to
          missions lying beyond the border of the Kongo Independent State.
          Ecclesiastical jurisdiction centers at Zanzibar. The Protestant
          missions are carried on by the Church Missionary Society, the
          Universities Mission, the German East Africa Mission, the
          Leipsic Missionary Society, the Moravian Church, and the Berlin
          Missionary Society. The two last-named societies are active at
          the north end of Lake Nyassa; and the Moravians are extending
          stations thence northward. The Universities Mission has stations
          along the Rovuma River and on the eastern shore of Lake Nyassa.
          The Berlin society has a station at Dar-al-Salam on the Indian
          Ocean; and the other German societies have their stations mostly
          along the northern boundary and in the foothills of Mounts
          Kilima-Njaro and Mweru. All these societies together report 60
          central stations, 123 missionaries, and 230 schools with about
          11,000 scholars. The Leipsic society has a printing-press, and
          publishes a newspaper at one of the Kilima-Njaro stations. The
          Suahili version of the Bible is used along the coast (completed
          in 1892). The New Testament has been translated into Yao (1880)
          and Gogo (1887). Some of the Gospels have been translated into
          Bondei, Chagga, Kaguru, Nyamwezi, Sagalla, Shambale, and Sukuma,
          and the translation is progressing in several of these as the
          people acquire a taste for reading.

          German Southwest Africa: A German colony and protectorate on the
          west coast of Africa, lying south of Angola and bounded on the
          east and south by Cape Colony and the Bechuanaland protectorate.
          Area 322,450 sq. miles; population about 200,000, composed of
          Namaquas (Hottentots) and Damaras, with Hereros and Ovambos in
          the north, who are of Bantu stock. The European population
          numbers 4,682. Walfisch Bay on this coast is a British
          possession belonging to Cape Colony. The seat of administration
          is Windhoek. The chief seaport is Swakopmund, whence a railway
          of 236 miles leads to Windhoek. The Hereros in the north and the
          Namaquas in the south have been at war against the German
          authorities since 1904, and the colony has suffered much in
          consequence. Roman Catholic missions are carried on by the
          Oblates of Hünfeld, and the Oblates of St. Francis of Sales
          (Vienna). The latter have 2 missionaries and 4 nuns. The other
          missions have been disturbed by the war, and statistics are not
          given. Protestant missions are carried on by the Rhenish
          Missionary Society of Germany, and the Finland Missionary
          Society. Together these societies had about 16,000 adherents
          before the war; but recent statistics are lacking, a number of
          the stations having been destroyed. The Bible has been
          translated into Namaqua (1881), and the New Testament into
          Herero (1877). Some Gospels have been completed in Kuanyama and
          Ndonga (Ovambo).

          Gold Coast Colony: A British crown colony and territory
          stretching for 350 miles along the Gulf of Guinea, in West
          Africa, between the Ivory Coast and Togoland. Area 119,260 sq.
          miles; population 1,500,000. About 32,000 of the people are
          Mohammedans; 35,000, Protestants; 6,000, Roman Catholics; and
          the rest are pagans of the animist type with deep veneration for
          fetishes. The Roman Catholic missions are connected with the
          Lyons Seminary for African Missions, and have 16 missionaries
          with 13 schools. Protestant missions were commenced in 1752 by
          the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel. As a result of
          this mission an African, Philip Quaque, was taken to England,
          educated, ordained, and returning to the Gold Coast, preached
          there for some fifty years. The missions now existing are those
          of the Basel Missionary Society, the Wesleyan Methodist
          Missionary Society (England), the National Baptist Convention
          (U. S. A.), and, since 1905, the Society for the Propagation of
          the Gospel. These missions together report 875 places of regular
          worship, 82 missionaries (men and women), 1,088 native workers,
          235 schools with 11,557 scholars, and 34,835 Christian
          adherents. The missions make steady progress; but, at the same
          time, they point out that Mohammedanism is also making progress
          among the pagans. Kumassi, the former capital of Ashantiland, is
          now connected with the coast by a railway 168 miles long; and
          light steamers are used on the Volta River. An artificial harbor
          is being constructed at Sekondi, the coast terminal of the
          railway. The Bible has been translated into Akra (1844-65) and
          Otshi (1870). The New Testament has been translated into Fanti
          (1884) and Ewé (1872). Progress has been made toward completing
          the Bible in both of these dialects.

          Ivory Coast: A French territory included in the great
          administrative region known as French West Africa. It has its
          coast-line between Liberia and the British Gold Coast Colony,
          and extends inland to the territory of Senegambia and the Niger.
          The French first obtained possessions on this coast in 1843.
          Area 200,000 sq. miles; population about 3,000,000, of whom 300
          are Europeans. In religion about 200,000 are Mohammedans; about
          1,000, Roman Catholics; and the rest, pagans. The capital is
          Bingerville. A railway is being constructed inland from Bassani,
          of which 110 miles are nearly finished. The only missions in the
          country are carried on by the Lyons Seminary for Missions in
          Africa (Roman Catholic). There are said to be 16 priests, who
          have 7 schools and some orphanages.

          Kamerun: A protectorate and colonial possession of Germany,
          occupying the west coast of Africa between French Kongo and
          Nigeria. Inland it extends in a northeasterly direction to Lake
          Chad. Area about 191,000 sq. miles; population (estimated)
          3,500,000, of whom (in 1904) 710 were whites. The native
          population is largely of the Bantu race, with tribes of Sudan
          negroes inland. Capital, Buea. The German annexation took place
          in 1884. Roman Catholic missions have been active in this region
          since 1889, and are in charge of the Pallotin Missionary Society
          of Limburg. They report 7 stations, 34 missionaries, 20 nuns,
          2,418 pupils in their schools, and 3,780 Roman Catholic
          Christians. Protestant missions were commenced by Alfred Saker
          of the Baptist Missionary Society (England) in 1844, he having
          been expelled from Fernando Po by the Spanish, government. With
          the German colonization of Kamerun (1880-82) difficulties arose,
          and the Baptist mission was turned over to the Basel Missionary
          Society, T. J. Comber and G. Grenfell of the Baptist mission
          going south to found a mission on the Kongo. A considerable body
          of the native Baptists declined to accept the transfer, and the
          German Baptists of Berlin sent missionaries to care for them.
          The German Baptist mission reports 14 missionaries, 1,400
          pupils, and 2,170 professed Christians. The Basel Society's
          mission, established in 1885, has extended inland, and reports
          (1905) 64 missionaries, 163 native workers, 6,452 pupils, and
          6,422 professed Christians. The eagerness of the natives to
          learn to read is remarkable. The American Presbyterians (North)
          opened a mission in the southern part of the country in 1885-93,
          which has 30 missionaries, 27 stations and outstations, 15
          schools, a hospital, and about 3,000 professing Christians. The
          entire Bible was translated into Dualla by the Baptista in 1868,
          and a version of the New Testament in the same language, which
          others than Baptists can use, was issued in 1902. The Benga
          Bible, used in the Rio Muni colony, is circulated to some extent
          in the south of Kamerun, and parts of the Bible have been
          translated into Isuba and Bala.

          Kongo Independent State: A region occupying in general the basin
          of the Kongo River and its tributaries in West Central Africa.
          It touches the seacoast by a narrow neck that extends along the
          right bank of the river to its mouth. The left bank is held by
          Portugal. By international agreement in 1885 the state was
          placed under the sovereignty of King Leopold II. of Belgium. H.
          M. Stanley, who first explored the region, was its first
          administrator. International resolutions declare the navigation
          of the Kongo and its branches free to all, and proclaim the
          suppression of the slave-trade and the protection of the native
          inhabitants. The region has highlands well adapted to the
          residence of Europeans, and its natural wealth, although but
          slightly developed, is probably very great. The state appears to
          be administered upon the ancient colonial theory of deriving
          revenue from it at all hazards. Great tracts of its territory
          have been passed over to trading companies, the first condition
          of whose concessions is an obligation to pay the king of Belgium
          from 40 to 45 per cent. of their gains. The result has been
          abuses. The trading companies are charged with forcing the
          natives to work, treating them in fact as slaves, flogging and
          killing or mutilating them when they fail to obey orders.
          Missionaries made facts of this nature known, and King Leopold
          appointed a commission to examine the situation, with the result
          that many terrible outrages were found to be habitually
          committed by the armed guards organized by the trading
          companies. The commission, while inclined to justify severe
          measures, as necessary to lead the natives to work, recommended
          that the trading companies be forbidden to use armed guards or
          to require forced labor from the people of the districts which
          they administer. There is some hope of an amelioration of
          conditions in consequence. The capital is Boma, at the mouth of
          the Kongo River.

          The area of the state is estimated at about 900,000 sq. miles;
          population estimated at from 15,000,000 to 30,000,000. The white
          people number 2,483. For the most part the people of the Kongo
          are of the Bantu race. Every tribe has its own dialect, so that
          the number of dialects is considerable. Roman Catholic missions
          were established in the Kongo region in the latter part of the
          fifteenth century. It should be remembered, however, that these
          early missions were almost entirely in what is now still
          Portuguese territory. Nothing seems to have been undertaken at
          that time in the interior of what is now Kongo State. At the
          present time the Roman Catholic missions extend along the river
          and in the Ubangi district. They have founded a number of
          stations also in the Tanganyika region. Schools, industrial
          work, and agricultural operations are carried on with
          considerable success. Some of the natives have been trained by
          the missionaries in Europe as physicians, and render good
          service as such. Statistics of the missions are not clearly
          given, but seem to show about 20,000 converts. Protestant
          missions in this region quickly followed the explorations of H.
          M. Stanley. The Livingstone Inland Mission from England
          commenced work on the lower Kongo in 1878, but their stations
          were shortly transferred to the American Baptist Missionary
          Union. The Baptist Missionary Society of England established a
          mission on the upper river in 1879 having for its pioneers
          Grenfell, Comber, and Bentley; the Plymouth Brethren, led by F.
          S. Arnot, in the Garenganze region in 1881; the Regions Beyond
          Missionary Union, in the Balolo district of the upper Kongo in
          1889; the American Presbyterians (South), led by S. N. Lapsley,
          on the Kassai River in 1891; the Swedish Missionary Society on
          the right bank of the lower Kongo in 1882. These missionary
          societies have about 200 missionaries and nearly 1,000 native
          workers, with schools, hospitals, industrial establishments,
          including printing-houses, and about 15,000 adherents. Several
          missionary steamers ply on the great river. Educational work is
          rapidly expanding, the natives showing the greatest eagerness to
          learn to read. The Belgian commission of inquiry in its report
          (1905) paid a high tribute to the value of these missions in
          singling out the field of the Baptist Missionary Society as a
          district where the natives have been taught to work and are
          noticeably industrious. Several of the dialects of the region
          have been reduced to writing by the missionaries. The whole
          Bible has been printed in Fioti (completed 1904); the New
          Testament, in Kongo (1893); and parts of the New Testament, in
          the Teke, Laba, Bopoto, Bolegin, Bangi, Nsembe, and Balolo.
          These latter translations are more or less tentative, and will
          hardly be enlarged more rapidly than the increase of readers may
          demand. In the mean time the Fioti Bible can be understood by
          people using other dialects in ordinary speech.

          Lagos: A British colony and protectorate in Western Africa lying
          on the coast between Dahomey and Southern Nigeria, and extending
          inland to the French territories of the middle Niger. Area,
          including Yorubaland and the protectorate, 25,450 sq. miles;
          population (estimated) 1,500,000. The great mass of the
          population are pagan fetish-worshipers. There are some 7,000
          Mohammedans, 15,000 Roman Catholics, and 32,000 Protestants. A
          railway has been built from Lagos to Ibadan in the Yoruba
          country, with a branch to Abeokuta. The Yoruba chiefs are
          allowed to govern their land under British supervision.

          Roman Catholic missions are under the Lyons Seminary for African
          Missions. They report 27 priests, 24 schools, and several
          charitable institutions. The Protestant missions are carried on
          by the Church Missionary Society and a native pastorate in
          cooperation with it; by the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary
          Society; by the Southern Baptist Convention (1856); and by the
          National Baptist Convention (U. S. A.). The whole Protestant
          missionary body has 189 stations and outstations, 55
          missionaries (men and women), 317 native workers, 110 schools
          with 7,000 scholars, and 3 hospitals and dispensaries. The
          government maintains Mohammedan and pagan schools, but the
          pupils availing themselves of this privilege of non-Christian
          education in 1902 were only 192. Abeokuta was evangelized in the
          first instance about 1842 by freed slaves who had been taught
          Christianity in Sierra Leone, 1,000 miles to the westward, and
          who led the people of the city to invite the Church Missionary
          Society to send missionaries there. This was done in 1846. A
          remarkable man connected with this mission in its early days was
          [124]Samuel Crowther, rescued as a boy from a Portuguese slaver,
          educated, and sent as a preacher to Abeokuta where he found his
          relatives. He afterward was consecrated bishop of the Niger in
          Canterbury Cathedral, and rendered admirable service to the
          mission during a long life. The assistant bishop of Yorubaland,
          now, is a full-blooded African. In 1903 the paramount chief of
          Abeokuta visited London to do homage to the king, and at the
          same time called at the offices of the Church Missionary Society
          and the Bible Society to express thanks for great services
          rendered to his people. The Bible has been translated into
          Yoruban (1850), and the New Testament into Hausa (1857). One of
          the Gospels has been tentatively translated into Igbira.

          Liberia: An independent republic in Western Africa which has
          grown out of an effort to colonize freed slaves from America.
          The first settlement was made in 1822. The republican government
          was organized in 1847. The coast of the republic extends from
          Sierra Leone to the Ivory Coast Colony. The territory extends
          about 200 miles inland, and is hemmed in on the east by French
          territory. Only a region extending about 25 or 30 miles inland
          from the coast, however, is effectively administered by the
          republic. Area about 45,000 sq, miles; population (estimated)
          2,000,000, about 20,000 of whom are of American origin. The
          language of the republic is English. Several native dialects are
          found among the tribes of the interior. It is estimated that
          there are about 850,000 Mohammedans and somewhat over 1,000,000
          pagans in Liberia, with about 500 Roman Catholics and 25,000
          Protestant Christians. Roman Catholic missions are dependent
          upon their headquarters at Free Town in Sierra Leone. The
          missionaries belong to the Congregation of the Holy Ghost and
          Sacred Heart of Mary. Since 1903 there has been a separate
          missionary jurisdiction confided to the Marist Fathers.
          Protestant missions in Liberia were commenced by the American
          Baptist Convention through the Rev. Lott Carey, who went to
          Monrovia in 1822. After disease had carried off many victims
          among the missionaries the mission was given up. The
          Presbyterian Church (North) established a mission in Liberia in
          1833, which was also given up on account of the ravages of
          disease among the missionaries. The American Methodist Church
          established a mission at Monrovia in 1833, of which the Rev.
          Melville B. Cox was the pioneer. This mission is still carried
          on with a great measure of success. The American Protestant
          Episcopal Church established a mission at Cape Palmas in 1834,
          with the Rev. John (afterward Bishop) Payne as one of the first
          missionaries. This mission is still carried on with considerable
          success, about twenty of the mission clergy being from the Grebo
          tribe of natives. The American Board established a mission at
          Cape Palmas in 1834, the Rev. J. L. Wilson being one of the
          earliest missionaries. On account of the unhealthfulness of the
          region the missionaries and a number of their adherents removed
          in 1842 to the Gabun district in what is now the French Kongo
          colony, transferring their buildings and other immovables in
          Liberia to the Protestant Episcopal Mission. The National
          Baptist Convention established a mission in Liberia in 1853, and
          the Evangelical Lutheran General Synod of North America also
          established a mission in 1860 which is doing good industrial
          work. These societies together report 92 missionaries and 182
          native workers operating at 168 stations, with schools,
          hospitals, printing-presses, and industrial institutions. Parts
          of the New Testament have been translated into Grebo (1838). See
          [125]Liberia.

          Morocco: An independent Mohammedan empire in Northwest Africa
          having a coast-line on the Mediterranean and on the Atlantic
          Ocean. The country is gradually falling under the direction of
          France. Area 219,000 sq. miles (the southern frontier, however,
          is not definitely fixed); population (estimated) 5,000,000,
          being composed of Berbers, Tuaregs, and Arabs. In name, at
          least, the greater part of the population is reckoned as
          Mohammedan. There are about 150,000 Jews and about 6,000
          Christians of the Roman Catholic and Eastern churches, with a
          few Protestants. An apostolic prefecture of the Roman Catholics
          was established at Tangier in 1859, and under it are about forty
          priests in different cities of Morocco. Protestant missions are
          carried on by the North Africa Mission (1881), the Gospel
          Mission Union (U.S.A., 1894), and the Southern Morocco Mission
          (1888); besides some workers among the Jews in Tangier. There is
          little religious liberty in Morocco, and there seems to be but
          little growth of the Protestant community.

          Natal: A British colony in South Africa lying on the eastern
          coast between Cape Colony and Portuguese East Africa. It is
          bounded inland by the Transvaal, the Orange River Colony, and
          Basutoland. Area 35,306 sq. miles; population (1903) 1,039,787.
          Of these, 877,388 are Zulu-Kafirs; 97,857, Asiatics; and 82,542,
          Europeans. About 850,000 of the population are pagans, 30,000
          are Hindus, 14,000 are Mohammedans, 15,000 are Buddhists or
          Confucians, 22,000 are Roman Catholics, and 73,000 are
          Protestants. The country takes its name from the whim of Vasco
          da Gama, the Portuguese navigator, who happened to arrive at the
          coast on Christmas day. Roman Catholic missions are under the
          care of the Oblates of Mary the Immaculate; they report 50
          missionaries and 7 native clergy, with 55 schools and several
          orphanages and hospitals. Their ecclesiastical center is at
          Pietermaritzburg, the seat of a vicar apostolic. The local
          Anglican, Wesleyan, and Dutch Reformed congregations all carry
          on missionary work; and, besides these, the following eleven
          missionary societies are at work in Natal: the American Board
          (1835), whose early missionaries were, Daniel Lindley, Robert
          Adams, Aldin and Lewis Grout, and Josiah Tyler; the United Free
          Church of Scotland; the Society for the Propagation of the
          Gospel, both of which entered Natal as an extension of work in
          Kaffraria; the Berlin Missionary Society; the Hermamusburg
          Missionary Society; the Norwegian Missionary Society; the
          Swedish Evangelical Mission Covenant; the Free Methodists of
          North America; the South Africa General Mission; the National
          Baptist Convention; and the Plymouth Brethren. All these
          societies together report 192 stations and outstations, 106
          missionaries (men and women), 612 native workers, 161 schools
          with 7,016 pupils, 2 hospitals, and one printing-house. Many of
          the native churches formerly connected with the older missions
          are now independent and self-supporting, and do not appear on
          the mission statistics because reckoned as churches of the
          country. Many of the tribal chiefs, who are pagans and
          polygamists of a rank order, but who nevertheless treat
          missionaries as benefactors, oppose the Christian Church with
          all their might as tending to make their "subjects" think for
          themselves and question the commands of hereditary despots. The
          British authorities are inclined to hamper the freedom of the
          missions on account of their suspicion of "Ethiopianism." At
          present a native preacher may not officiate in a church unless
          under the immediate supervision of a responsible white
          clergyman.

          The Bible has been translated into Zulu (1851-83). This is one
          of the most important of the African versions published by the
          American Bible Society. It has a range of circulation extending
          to Lake Nyassa and into Bechuanaland.

          Nigeria: A British territory and sphere of influence in West
          Africa lying on the coast between Lagos and Kamerun, and
          extending inland between the German and the French possessions
          as far as Lake Chad. It is divided into Northern and Southern
          Nigeria. Lagos with its protectorate is naturally a part of the
          region, but at present is separately administered. Area:
          Northern Nigeria, 315,000 sq. miles; Southern Nigeria, 49,700
          sq. miles; population (estimated for the whole great region)
          23,000,000. It is estimated that the Mohammedan part of the
          population numbers about 10,000,000, and the pagan part about
          13,000,000. This is mere guesswork, since the country is not
          even explored. In all the coast regions the pagans, of the most
          degraded class of fetish-worshipers, predominate. In Northern
          Nigeria the Mohammedan element is the ruling one (under British
          restraint), but there are large sections occupied by pagan
          tribes. Christians are for the most part in Southern Nigeria,
          and their numbers are given as: Roman Catholics, 18,000;
          Protestants, 6,000. The seat of government in Northern Nigeria
          is Zungeru on the Kaduna River; that of Southern Nigeria is Old
          Calabar. Steamers ply on the Niger about 400 miles from its
          mouth. A railway is being constructed in Northern Nigeria from
          Zungeru toward Kano, a great trading center south of Lake Chad.

          Roman Catholic missions are carried on by the Congregation of
          the Holy Ghost and the Sacred Heart of Mary. Ten missionaries
          are reported with 6 schools. Protestant missions are those of
          the United Free Church of Scotland in the Calabar region in
          Southern Nigeria (1846) and of the Church Missionary Society in
          the Niger delta (1857) and in Northern Nigeria (1902, after a
          failure in 1890), the Qua Ibo Mission on the Qua River (1887),
          and the African Evangelistic Mission (1901) and the Sudan United
          Mission (1903) in Northern Nigeria. The missions in Northern
          Nigeria are still in the early stage, with little more to show
          than the names of Wilmot Brooke, J. A. Robinson, and W. R. S.
          Miller who sacrificed life for that land. In Southern Nigeria
          there are 82 missionaries (men and women), and 157 schools with
          2,482 scholars. The Anglican bishop of this region is assisted
          by a bishop who is a full-blooded negro. The Bible has been
          translated into Efik (1862); and tentative translations of
          single Gospels have been made into Akunakuna, into three or four
          dialects of Ibo, into Idzo, and into Umon. These are all
          dialects of Southern Nigeria. Gospels have been translated into
          the Igbira and Nupé languages besides the Hausa language, all in
          Northern Nigeria.

          Orange River Colony: A British possession in South Africa. It
          has the Transvaal on the north, Natal and Basutoland on the
          east, and Cape Colony on the west and south. During forty-six
          years it was the Orange Free State and was annexed to the
          British crown in May, 1900, in consequence of its participation
          in the Boer attack on the adjacent British colonies. Area 50,100
          sq. miles; population (1904) 385,045, of whom 143,419 are whites
          and 241,626 are colored. Capital, Bloemfontein. About 220,000 of
          the inhabitants are pagans. The predominating Christian body is
          the Dutch Reformed Church. The whole number of Protestants is
          about 100,000; of Roman Catholics, 5,000. The country is an
          excellent agricultural region. Diamonds and other precious
          stones are found in some sections; and the population tends to
          increase and to become more and more varied in its constituent
          elements. Roman Catholic missions are in charge of the Oblates
          of Mary the Immaculate. The statistics of their work in the
          colony are not separately given, but there seem to be 14
          missionary priests and 2 native priests, with 13 schools.
          Protestant missionary activities are largely in the hands of the
          local churches. The Dutch Reformed Church has here shown, much
          more than elsewhere used to be the case, a purpose to work for
          the evangelization of the native pagans. The Wesleyan Church and
          the Anglican Church both have missions locally supported; but
          the work for whites and blacks is not separately reported.
          Besides this local church work, in beginning which the Paris
          Missionary Society had a part (1831), the Berlin Missionary
          Society (1834) is at work in the colony with 33 stations and
          outstations, 18 missionaries, 148 native workers, 27 schools,
          and about 8,000 professed Christians connected with its
          stations. The Society for the Propagation of the Gospel (1863)
          has 4 stations among the natives, but its statistics are not
          separately given. The Zulu Bible, the Chuana version, and the
          Lesuto version used in Basutoland supply the needs of the people
          in this colony.

          Portuguese East Africa: One of the oldest Portuguese possessions
          in Africa, situated on the east coast between German East Africa
          and Natal. It extends inland to British Central Africa, and on
          both banks of the Zambesi River to Rhodesia. It is composed of
          the districts of Mozambique, Zambesia, and Lourenço Marques.
          Area 293,400 sq. miles; population (estimated) 3,120,000. Much
          of the territory is in the hands of trading companies, which
          administer the laws in their respective districts. Delagoa Bay
          is connected by railway with Pretoria in the Transvaal, and
          another railway runs from Beira in Zambesia to Buluwayo in
          Rhodesia. The Portuguese began their colonies on this coast in
          1505, and the Roman Catholic Church has had strong missions in
          the region ever since. The ecclesiastical organization was
          effected in 1612. At present missions in this territory are in
          the hands of the Society of Jesus, with stations extending along
          the Zambesi River into the interior. About 30 missionaries are
          reported. Protestant missions are carried on by the American
          Methodist Episcopal Church at Inhambane, by the Wesleyan
          Methodists of England in the Delagoa Bay district, by the Swiss
          Romande Mission in the south, and by the American Board among
          the Gaza tribes and at Beira, the chief seaport of the district
          of Zambesia. The Universities Mission has one station in this
          territory adjoining its field in Nyassaland. These societies
          together have 40 missionaries (men and women), 103 native
          workers, and about 7,000 adherents, with hospitals and schools.
          A printing-press at Inhambane is beginning to form a literature
          in two native languages. The New Testament has been translated
          into Tonga (1890), and the Gospels into Sheetswa (1891). A
          Gospel has been translated into Ronga by the Swiss Romande
          missionaries.

          Portuguese Guinea: A Portuguese possession adjoining French
          Kongo on the West African coast, and surrounded by French
          territory on the land side. It is included in the administration
          of the Cape Verde Islands. Area, including the islands, 6,280
          sq. miles; population, including the islands, 1,000,000. The
          population is generally given as including 260,000 Roman
          Catholics; and there are about 170,000 Mohammedans and over
          500,000 pagans on the mainland. Roman Catholic missions were
          established on the mainland in 1832, and are connected with the
          ecclesiastical province of Lisbon. They comprise eight Roman
          Catholic parishes. No Protestant missions have been established
          in this territory.

          Rhodesia: An immense territory in South Africa, lying between
          the Transvaal and the Kongo Independent State, and having as its
          eastern boundary Portuguese East Africa, and as its western
          boundary Angola and German Southwest Africa. It is administered
          as British territory by the British South Africa Company under a
          British resident commissioner. In its northeastern portion,
          where it touches Lake Tanganyika, police duties are cared for by
          the Nyassaland protectorate. It is divided into Southern
          Rhodesia and Northern Rhodesia by the Zambesi River. Area about
          246,000 sq. miles; population about 900,000, of whom 12,000 are
          Europeans and about 1,100 are Asiatics. There are about 5,000
          Roman Catholics and 20,000 Protestants in this country. The
          Roman Catholic missions are not conterminous with the boundaries
          of this territory, and it is impossible to give their
          statistics. The missionaries are of the Algerian Society with a
          certain number of Jesuits in the Zambesi region. Protestant
          missions in this region were commenced by Robert Moffat of the
          London Missionary Society in 1830. Livingstone explored the
          whole region for the same society and unsuccessfully attempted
          to establish stations among the Mashonas. John Mackenzie was a
          worthy successor of such pioneers. At present the Protestant
          missionary societies in Rhodesia are: the London Missionary
          Society in Matabeleland and at the southern end of Lake
          Tanganyika; the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society in
          Mashonaland and Matabeleland; and the Paris Missionary Society
          in Barotseland in the territory north of the Zambesi, which F.
          Coillard entered in 1885 as an extension of the Society's work
          in Basutoland, the Barotses having the same speech as the
          Basutos. The Methodist Episcopal Missionary Society (U. S. A.)
          and the American Board have missions in the eastern part of
          Southern Rhodesia, near the Portuguese frontier. These societies
          together have 112 stations and outstations, 70 missionaries (men
          and women), 6,000 pupils in their schools, and 15,000 professed
          Christians. The construction of railways, connecting Rhodesia
          with Cape Town and the Portuguese seaports and opening up the
          country beyond the Zambesi, is bringing many colonists into the
          country; and their advent implies that a testing time of the
          reality of the Christianity of the native churches is at hand.
          The people use the Bible in Zulu, in Sechuana, and in Lesuto.
          Tentative translations of Gospels have been made in the Matabele
          and the Mashona languages.

          Rio De Oro: A Spanish possession in North Africa stretching
          southward along the shore to the Atlantic Ocean from the Morocco
          frontier and extending inland to the French possessions of the
          Sahara. Area about 70,000 sq. miles; population (estimated)
          130,000, almost all Mohammedans. The territory is administered
          by the governor of the Canary Islands. Roman Catholic missions
          ecclesiastically connected with the Canary Islands are
          established at the points occupied by Spanish traders. There are
          no Protestant missions in the country.

          Rio Xuni: Spanish possession in West Africa adjoining the German
          Kamerun colony and surrounded on the east and south by the
          territory of the French Kongo. Area 9,800 sq. miles; population
          (estimated) 140,000, including about 300 whites. Roman Catholic
          missions have existed here since 1855 and are carried on by the
          Spanish Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Mary, being
          ecclesiastically connected with the island diocese of Annobon
          and Fernando Po. A Protestant mission has been carried on in
          this territory by the American Presbyterians (North) who
          established themselves in 1855 on the island of Corisco, and
          later on the Benito River. They have 4 stations and outstations,
          7 schools, and about 300 professed Christians. The Bible has
          been translated into the Benga language (1858), which has a
          somewhat extensive domain in the coast regions.

          Senegal: A French colony in West Africa between the Gambia and
          the Senegal rivers. It consists of a narrow strip of coast land,
          forming the colony proper, together with certain ports on the
          Senegal River. Area 438 sq. miles; population (1904) 107,826, of
          whom 2,804 Are Europeans. The people of the colony proper are
          citizens, having the right to vote, and being represented by a
          deputy in the French parliament. The capital of the colony is
          St. Louis, on the seacoast. Roman Catholic missions have long
          existed in Senegal, and were placed under an ecclesiastical
          prefecture in 1765. There are about 5,000 native Roman Catholics
          in the colony. The only Protestant mission working in Senegal is
          that of the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society, which has a
          station at St. Louis (1863) and two or three small congregations
          in the vicinity. Besides the Arabic Bible, which is occasionally
          called for, some of the Gospels have been translated into the
          Wolof and Mandingo languages (1882).

          Senegambia and the Niger: An immense French protectorate
          comprising the territories formerly called Western Sudan, with
          the larger part of the Sahara, having the colony of Senegal on
          the west, the colonies of the Ivory Coast, the Gold Coast,
          Dahomey, and Togoland on the south, and extending on the north
          to the Algerian Sahara. Area 2,500,000 sq. miles; population
          (estimated) 10,000,000. The prevailing religion is
          Mohammedanism. Many pagan tribes exist who serve Mohammedan
          rulers and furnish slaves for the markets of Tripoli and the
          Barbary States. The capital is Kayes, on the Senegal River. This
          great territory, with the French colonies of Senegal, French
          Guinea, Ivory Coast, and Dahomey, forms a single region known as
          French West Africa, of which the governor-general resides at
          Dakar on the coast of Senegal. Steamers run regularly on the
          Senegal River some 400 miles to Kayes; and a railway has been
          constructed from Kayes 650 miles to some important points on the
          upper Niger. A feature of this region is that the French
          government has planned a universal system of education which it
          is endeavoring to apply throughout the territories effectively
          occupied. Roman Catholic missions have been carried on for a
          number of years at several of the posts on the Senegal and Niger
          rivers; the number of converts is reported as 10,000. No
          Protestant missions are reported in this great region.

          Sierra Leone: A British colony and protectorate in West Africa,
          lying on the coast between Liberia and French Guinea, and
          extending inland about 180 miles, limited by the boundaries of
          the French possessions and of Liberia. Area about 34,000 sq.
          miles; population about 1,100,000. Of the people about 1,000,000
          are pagans, 20,000 are Mohammedans, 5,000 are Roman Catholics,
          and 50,000 are Protestants. The colony proper is limited to the
          Sierra Leone peninsula. It was the place whence in 1562 the
          first slaves were taken to the West Indies under the British
          flag. After slaves in England had been set free, in 1772, a
          district in Sierra Leone was set apart to be colonized by
          liberated slaves. Here, from 1786 on, freed slaves were landed
          and almost abandoned to their own resources except as to food--a
          great crowd of debased creatures from all parts of Africa,
          knowing no common language and having no principle of life
          except such evil things as they had picked up during slavery
          among Europeans. The situation of these freed slaves had a
          powerful influence in turning English missionary zeal to West
          Africa. The Roman Catholic establishment is under an apostolic
          vicariate erected in 1858 at Freetown. The missionaries are of
          the Congregation of the Holy Ghost and the Sacred Heart of Mary.
          The number of Roman Catholics is 2,800.

          The Protestant missionary enterprise was commenced in the latter
          part of the eighteenth century by missionaries from Scotland;
          three having died soon after their arrival, the mission was
          given up. The Church Missionary Society sent missionaries to
          Sierra Leone in 1804; but they were instructed to go north and
          begin their mission in the Susu country on the Rio Pongas in
          what is now French Guinea. They were all Germans, chosen because
          of the difficulty of securing ordination of Englishmen for this
          society. The mission came to naught through the hostility of the
          slave-dealers, and was finally transferred (1814-16) to Sierra
          Leone. Here a solid work was soon organized among the freed
          slaves, and has grown ever since. The Protestant missionary
          societies now working in that field are: the Church Missionary
          Society, the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary Society, the Wesleyan
          Methodist Connection of America, the United Brethren (U. S. A.)
          in the Mendi region, and the Christian and Missionary Alliance
          (U. S. A.) in the eastern part of the protectorate. The Church
          Missionary Society field is almost wholly in the protectorate,
          the congregations in Sierra Leone being self-supporting and
          independent. Together the mission stations and outstations
          number about 131. There are 42 missionaries (men and women), 117
          schools, and about 45,000 professed Christians connected with
          the missions. The English Bible is used in the colony. The New
          Testament has been translated into Temné (1866); parts of the
          New Testament into Mendi; and single Gospels, into Bullom and
          Kuranko. The Yoruba mission of the Church Missionary society was
          an outgrowth of the society's work among freed slaves at Sierra
          Leone. See below, [126]III., Lagos.

          Somaliland (British): A British protectorate on the east coast
          of North Africa, lying between Abyssinia and the sea and between
          French Somaliland and Italian Somaliland. It is administered by
          a consul-general. Area about 60,000 sq. miles; population
          (estimated) 300,000; religion, Mohammedan. Most of the people of
          this district are nomads and very fanatical in their intolerance
          of Christians. The English government has been at a considerable
          expense in money and men to pacify the tribes of the interior,
          who have attempted to drive the English from the country on
          religious grounds. No missions are reported in this district.

          Somaliland (French): A French protectorate on the eastern coast
          of North Africa, near the Straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, between the
          Italian colony of Eritrea and British Somaliland, extending
          inland to the Abyssinian border and including the colony of
          Obock. Capital, Jibuti. Area about 46,000 sq. miles; population
          about 200,000, mostly Mohammedans, with some 40,000 pagans, and
          in the colony of Obock about 8,000 Christians. A railway has
          been constructed from Jibuti to the Harrar frontier in
          Abyssinia. There has been for many years a Roman Catholic
          mission conducted by the French Capuchins who have two or three
          schools at Obock and Jibuti, and are reaching out toward
          Abyssinia.

          Somaliland (Italian): An Italian possession on the eastern coast
          of North Africa, lying between the Gulf of Aden and Abyssinia,
          and between British Somaliland and the mouth of the Juba River,
          the frontier of British East Africa. The sovereign rights of the
          Sultan of Zanzibar over this coast region were bought by Italy
          in 1905. Area about 100,000 sq. miles; population (estimated)
          400,000, chiefly Mohammedans, with about 50,000 pagans. There
          are no records of missions established in this wild territory.

          Sudan: This term is here limited to the Egyptian Sudan, the
          Western and Central Sudan being absorbed in the main into French
          spheres of influence to which other names have been given (see
          [127]Senegambia and the Niger, above). The Egyptian Sudan is a
          territory extending south from the frontier of Egypt to Uganda
          and the Kongo Independent State, and west from the Red Sea to
          the unmarked boundary of the French sphere of influence. It is
          nominally a possession of Egypt, but in fact is ruled for Egypt
          by the British. English and Egyptian flags are used together
          throughout the territory. Area about 950,000 sq. miles;
          population (estimated) 2,000,000. The population of the country
          was much reduced during the sixteen years' rule of the Mahdi and
          his dervishes, who as ardent Mohammedans wished to show the
          world how a country ought to be governed. General Gordon having
          been killed by the Mahdi's party in 1885, one of the first acts
          of the English on recovering the land in 1898 was to found a
          great "Gordon Memorial" College at Khartum, the scene of his
          murder, and now the seat of the new administration. The majority
          of the people are Mohammedans, with an uncertain number of pagan
          tribes in the southern districts. A considerable number of
          Greek, Coptic, and Armenian traders is found in the Khartum
          district. Roman Catholic missions exist at Khartum and Omdurman
          and among the pagans at Fashoda; a Mission of the American
          United Presbyterian Church has been founded on the Sobat River;
          and the Church Missionary Society has established missionaries
          (1906) at or near Bor in the vacant pagan country between the
          two first-named missions. All of these missions are too newly
          established to have any visible fruit except attendance at
          schools. The Arabic Bible is circulated in the Mohammedan parts
          of the Sudan. Gospels have been translated into the Dinka
          language.

          Togoland: A German colony in West Africa, occupying the coast of
          the Gulf of Guinea between the Gold Coast Colony and Dahomey. It
          extends inland to the French territory of Senegambia and the
          Niger. Area about 32,000 sq. miles; population (estimated)
          1,500,000, chiefly pagan; capital, Lome. The German government
          carries on several schools for the instruction of the natives,
          and is training them for administrative posts. Roman Catholic
          missions here are conducted by the Steyl Society for Divine
          Work. The missionaries number 28, with 9 nuns, 52 schools, 2,119
          pupils, and 2,203 Roman Catholic Christians. Protestant
          missionary work is carried on by the North German Missionary
          Society (1847), and by the Wesleyan Methodist Missionary
          Society, which employs German Methodists for this field. The two
          societies report 78 stations and outstations, 31 missionaries
          (men and women), 69 schools with 3,111 pupils, and 4,600
          professed Christians. The Ewé New Testament is used here, and a
          special translation of one of the Gospels, to satisfy local
          variations, has been tentatively prepared.

          Transvaal: A colony of Great Britain in South Africa, lying
          north of the Orange River Colony and Natal, and west of
          Portuguese East Africa. Area 111,196 sq. miles; population
          (1904) 1,268,716 of whom 969,389 are colored, including Chinese
          and Hindus, and 299,327 are whites. The colony was settled in
          1836-37 by Dutch who emigrated from Cape Colony. In 1899
          dissensions with Great Britain respecting sovereignty culminated
          in war, and in 1900 Great Britain formally annexed the territory
          to her South African domains, the Boers accepting the annexation
          after two years. The capital is Pretoria. The religious
          statistics show the pagans to number nearly 1,000,000; Roman
          Catholics, 10,000; Protestants, 256,000; Jews, 10,000; Buddhists
          and Confucians, 15,000. The Dutch churches form the largest
          single group of Protestants. Chinese laborers at the mines are a
          recent addition to the population. Numbers of negroes from all
          parts of Africa are also drawn to Johannesburg for work in the
          mines, about 75,000 natives and other colored people being
          gathered there by opportunities for work. The Anglican,
          Wesleyan, and Dutch Reformed local churches all carry on
          missions among the natives. Other Protestant missions are those
          of the American Board (1893), the Berlin Missionary Society
          (1859) opened by A. Merensky and Knothe, the Hermannsburg
          Missionary Society (1857), and the Swiss Romande Mission led by
          H. Berthoud (1875). These societies together report (not
          including the enterprises of the local churches) 112
          missionaries (men and women), 2,344 native workers, 300 schools
          with 14,674 pupils, and 84,000 professing Christian adherents.
          Efforts to improve the character of the workers in the mining
          compounds of Johannesburg are meeting with some success. The
          Zulu Bible is much used in the Transvaal as well as the Chuana
          and Lesuto versions. The New Testament has been translated into
          Tonga and Sepedi, both in 1888.

          Tripoli: A possession of Turkey on the north coast of Africa
          west of Egypt. It extends southward to the Sahara and includes
          the oasis of the Fezzan, but its southern limits are indefinite.
          This territory was seized by Turkey in the sixteenth century.
          Area about 400,000 sq. miles; population about 1,000,000,
          chiefly Berbers. There are about 6,000 Europeans (Maltese and
          Italians), who are mainly Roman Catholics; and there are also
          about 10,000 Jews. There is an extensive caravan trade with the
          Sudan and Timbuctoo; and the slavetrade is quietly fostered by
          this means. The only Protestant mission in Tripoli is that of
          the North Africa Mission, which has 1 station with 4
          missionaries, a hospital, and 2 dispensaries. Arabic and Kabyle
          are the languages of the country.

          Tunis: A French protectorate on the northern coast of Africa
          lying between Tripoli and Algeria. Area about 51,000 sq. miles;
          population (estimated) 1,900,000, mainly Berbers and Arabs, with
          a foreign population (1901) of 39,000 French, 67,500 Italians,
          and 12,000 Maltese. The Tunisian ruler, called the Bey, is from
          a family which has been in power since 1575, and governs the
          country under the control of a French resident. The Roman
          Catholic Church in Tunis is under direction of the archbishop of
          Carthage, the see having been restored in 1884. There are 53
          priests, 2 bishops, and several schools. Tunis was the scene of
          some of Raymond Lully's efforts to convert Mohammedans in the
          thirteenth century. Protestant missions are carried on in Tunis
          by the North African Mission, the Swedish Young Women's
          Christian Association, and the London Jews Society. Together
          these societies have 5 schools, 2 hospitals or dispensaries, and
          about 250 persons under instruction. Arabic is the prevailing
          language.

          Uganda: A British protectorate in East Central Africa, lying
          between the Egyptian Sudan on the north, German East Africa on
          the south, British East Africa on the east, and the Kongo
          Independent State on the west. Within its boundaries lie part of
          the Victoria Nyanza and lakes Albert and Albert Edward. It
          comprises the native kingdom of Uganda and several smaller
          districts ruled by native kinglets under British control. Area
          89,400 sq. miles; population about 4,000,000, of whom about
          1,000,000 are in the kingdom of Uganda. The religious divisions
          of the population in the whole protectorate are: pagans,
          3,500,000; Mohammedans, 50,000; Roman Catholics, 146,000; and
          Protestants, 250,000. A railway connects Mombasa on the coast of
          British East Africa with Kisumu, formerly called Port Florence,
          on the Victoria Nyanza. The seat of the British administration
          is Entebbe, and that of the kingdom of Uganda is Mengo. Henry M.
          Stanley visited Uganda in 1875, and found the king Mutesa a
          recent convert to Islam but inclined to ask questions on the
          religion of the Christians. He gave the king some instruction
          and had the Lord's Prayer translated for him into Suahili
          written in Arabic characters. At this time Uganda was like any
          other African kingdom a place of superstition, degradation of
          women, and bloodthirsty cruelty and oppression. Stanley was
          really the first of Christian missionaries there; for the slight
          teachings that he gave the king were not forgotten, and his
          translation of the Lord's Prayer was copied and recopied. On
          leaving Uganda Stanley wrote a letter to the London Telegraph
          describing Uganda and the willingness of King Mutesa to receive
          Christian instruction. He then addressed the missionary
          societies in these words: "Here, gentlemen, is your opportunity.
          The people on the shores of the Nyanza call upon you." This
          challenge was at once taken up by the Church Missionary Society;
          and in 1876 its first missionaries reached Uganda. The first
          converts were baptized in 1882, and persecution soon set in,
          when a number of the Christians were burned alive. Alexander
          Mackay, a layman and a member of the mission, was a man of
          indomitable energy and wonderful devotion; and upon him rested
          to a great degree the responsibility for the defense of the
          mission. Several of the missionaries were murdered, including
          Bishop James Hannington (1885), by order of King Mwanga,
          Mutesa's successor. Roman Catholic missionaries appeared on the
          scene; and quarrels and strife ensued between the two
          denominations. Mohammedans also intervened, trying to profit by
          the dissensions between the Christians. The British protectorate
          was declared in 1894. In 1897 the Sudanese troops in British
          employ revolted and attempted to seize the country in the
          Mohammedan interest. The valor of the Christians weighed largely
          in deciding this fierce little war against the mutineers. In it
          George Laurence Pilkington, a notable lay missionary lost his
          life. With the defeat of the mutineers and the assignment of the
          Mohammedans to separate reservations peace was finally
          established, and the whole protectorate is in a prosperous
          condition.

          The Church Missionary Society has now in the protectorate 90
          missionaries (men and women), 2,500 native workers, 170 schools
          with 22,229 scholars, and 53,000 baptized Christians. It had
          established a considerable industrial enterprise for the
          development of the people; but in 1904 this department of its
          work was turned over to the Uganda Company, a commercial body
          chartered in England to develop the country. The Roman Catholic
          missions were established by the Algiers Society for African
          Missions. There are now 88 stations and about 80,000 baptized
          Roman Catholic Christians. At Kaimosi, about twenty-five miles
          north of Port Florence, is a mission of the American Society of
          Friends, which is instructing the people in various industries.
          Altogether Uganda is after thirty years of missionary labor a
          remarkable instance of the change in a people which can be
          produced by the attempt to follow the principles of the Bible.
          The overthrow of barbarism in the native customs was effected
          before any outside political forces entered upon the scene. The
          Bible has been translated into Ugandan (1888), and Gospels have
          been rendered into Nyoro and Toro.

III. African Islands:

          Annobon. See [128]Fernando Po.

          Canary Islands: A group of islands lying north-west of Africa
          and belonging to Spain, of which they form a province. Area
          2,807 sq. miles; population 358,564, reckoned as entirely Roman
          Catholic, the first Roman Catholic see having been erected here
          in 1404.

          Cape Verde Islands: A group of fourteen islands lying off the
          west coast of Africa and belonging to Portugal. Area 1,480 sq.
          miles; population (1900) 147,424, of whom about two-thirds are
          negroes and nearly one-third of mixed blood. The religion is
          Roman Catholic.

          Comoro Isles: A group of small islands about half way between
          Madagascar and the African coast. Area 620 sq. miles; population
          about 47,000, chiefly Mohammedans. The islands are
          ecclesiastically under the jurisdiction of Mayotte, but it does
          not appear that any mission exists upon them.

          Corisco. See [129]Fernando Po.

          Fernando Po, Annobon, Corisco, and Elobey: Islands in the Gulf
          of Guinea, belonging to Spain. The area of these islands taken
          together is about 780 sq. miles; population 22,000. Roman
          Catholic missions are carried on in the islands by the Spanish
          Congregation of the Sacred Heart of Mary. Nineteen clergy are
          reported in Fernando Po, with about 4,000 Roman Catholics. There
          is a Protestant mission in Fernando Po, established by the
          Primitive Methodist Missionary Society in 1870, a mission
          established by the Baptist Missionary Society of England having
          been driven from the country by Spanish intolerance a number of
          years before. One of the Gospels was translated into Adiya, a
          dialect of Fernando Po, in 1846. It is now obsolete. There is a
          station of the American Presbyterian Church on the island of
          Corisco (see above, under [130]Rio Muni).

          Madagascar: An island off the southeastern coast of Africa, from
          which it is separated by the Mozambique Channel at a distance of
          240 miles, measuring between nearest points. It is 980 miles
          long, and 360 miles in its greatest breadth. It is a possession
          of France, whose claim dates from a concession made to a trading
          company by the king of France in 1642. The claim was not
          recognized by the native rulers. After a struggle lasting
          intermittently from 1882 to 1896 the formal annexation to France
          took place. Area 224,000 sq. miles; population (1901) 3,000,000,
          including 15,000 Europeans and some hundreds of Africans and
          Asiatics. The people are of Malay stock with an infusion of
          African blood. The principal tribe, which ruled the larger part
          of the island until the French occupation, is called Hova.
          Sakalava, Betsileo, and Sihanaka are the names of other
          important tribes. The history of Madagascar during many years is
          connected with the story of its evangelization through the
          London Missionary Society, beginning in 1818. The mission had
          great success during fifteen years. The language was reduced to
          writing; schools were established; the New Testament was
          translated and printed; and numbers of the people professed
          Christianity. In 1835 the reigning queen drove out the
          missionaries and proscribed Christianity. After bloody
          persecutions it was made a capital crime to profess the religion
          of Christ. This proscription ended in 1861; the missionaries
          returned; and in 1868 the then queen made public profession of
          Christianity. At the time of the French occupation there were
          about 450,000 Protestants and 50,000 Roman Catholics in the
          island. Roman Catholic missions were commenced in Madagascar in
          1844, having their center in the island of Nossi-Bé and the
          adjacent islands until 1850, when the care of the missions was
          entrusted to the Jesuits. There are now 348 Roman Catholic
          mission stations in the island with nearly 100,000 adherents. At
          the time of the French occupation the Protestant missions were
          looked upon with great suspicion. In anticipation of being
          obliged to withdraw from the islands, the London Missionary
          Society invited the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society to take
          over some of its stations.

          After a period of misunderstanding and friction with the Jesuit
          missionaries, religious liberty was made effective, and
          difficulties have gradually been removed. The Protestant
          societies now laboring in the island are: the London Missionary
          Society (1818), the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel
          (1843), the Friends Foreign Missionary Association (1867), the
          Norwegian Society (1867), the United Norwegian Lutheran Church
          in America (1892), the (Free) Lutheran Board of Missions (U. S.
          A., 1895), and the Paris Evangelical Missionary Society (1896).
          These societies together report 196 missionaries, 4,914 native
          workers, 2,729 schools with 133,262 pupils, and about 200,000
          baptized Christians. The effect of the French school laws may
          probably affect the higher missionary schools; but on the whole
          conditions are rapidly taking a satisfactory form. The Bible was
          translated into Malagasy in 1835 and revised in 1886.

          Madeira: An island forming a province of Portugal and lying west
          of North Africa. Area 505 sq. miles; population 150,574. The
          island was colonized by the Portuguese in 1420, and has been
          Roman Catholic for two centuries, the ancient inhabitants being
          entirely extinct. The American Methodist Episcopal Church has a
          mission in Madeira.

          Mauritius: An island colony of Great Britain, lying in the
          Indian Ocean 500 miles east of Madagascar. Area 705 sq. miles;
          population (1901) 378,195. The religious classification under
          the census of 1901 was as follows: Hindus, 206,131; Mohammedans,
          41,208; Roman Catholics, 113,224; Protestants, 6,644. Besides
          the parish priests there are 6 Jesuit missionaries and 11 from
          the Congregation of the Holy Ghost and the Sacred Heart of Mary.
          Protestant missions are carried on by the Church Missionary
          Society, the Society for the Propagation of the Gospel, and the
          Church of England Zenana Missionary Society. A large section of
          the population is of African or mixed blood, and the number of
          Chinese in business in the island is increasing.

          Mayotte: An island belonging to France, situated between
          Madagascar and the African coast. It is under the governor of
          Reunion. Area 140 sq. miles; population 11,640, which is
          diminishing. There are 6 Roman Catholic priests and about 3,000
          Roman Catholics in the island.

          Reunion: An island belonging to France, situated about 420 miles
          east of Madagascar. Area, 945 sq. miles; population (1902)
          173,395, of whom 13,492 are British Indians, 4,496 are natives
          of Madagascar, 9,457 are Africans, and 1,378 are Chinese. The
          rest of the inhabitants are reckoned as Roman Catholics. The
          island is the seat of a Roman Catholic bishop, and it forms a
          part of the ecclesiastical province of Bordeaux in France.

          Saint Thomas (Thomé) and Principe: Two islands in the Gulf of
          Guinea, belonging to Portugal, of which they are reckoned as a
          province. Area 360 sq. miles; population (1900) 42,000, of whom
          41,000 are negroes. These islands are a source of revenue to the
          Portuguese government, producing quantities of coffee, cocoa,
          and cinchona. The products are cultivated by slave labor still
          imported by the Portuguese "under contract" through Angola from
          central Africa. About 4,000 of these "laborers" are carried to
          the islands every year; and it is said that none return. A Roman
          Catholic diocese was established in these islands in 1584, and a
          large part of the population is reckoned as Roman Catholic.
          There are no Protestant missions in this colony.

          Primitive Form of Celebration (§ 1).

          Final Form of the Agape (§ 2).

          Disassociation of Agape and Eucharist (§ 3).

  1. Primitive Form of Celebration.

          The Greek word agape ("love," pl. agapai, Lat. agapæ) was used
          in the early Church, both Greek and Latin, to denote definite
          manifestations of brotherly love between believers, and
          particularly certain meals taken in common which had more or
          less of a religious character. The earliest mention of such
          meals is found in Jude 12 (possibly in II Pet. ii. 13). Distinct
          history begins with Tertullian, in the passage (Apologeticus,
          xxxix.) commencing: "Our supper bears a name which tells exactly
          what it is; it is called by the word which in Greek means
          affection.'" The agape served for the refreshment of the poorer
          brethren, as well as for the general edification. It was opened
          and closed with prayer, and after its conclusion one and another
          gave songs of praise, either from the Bible or of their own
          composition. These meetings were under the direction of the
          clergy, to whom (with reference to I Tim. v. 17) a double
          portion of food and drink was allotted. They were held at the
          time of the principal meal, and frequently were prolonged until
          dark. In the period for which Tertullian bears witness, they
          were not connected with the sacrament of the Eucharist; he says
          expressly (De corona, iii.) that the Lord instituted the
          sacrament on the occasion of a meal, while the Church does not
          so celebrate it, but rather before daybreak. Even apart from the
          secret nocturnal services of the times of persecution and the
          observance of the paschal vigil, the Eucharist was regularly
          celebrated before any meal. Notably was this rule, which is
          found referred to in Cyprian (Epist., lxiii. 16), established in
          Tertullian's time, but--which is decisive for the distinction
          between Eucharist and agape--it existed in many parts of the
          Church as early as that of Justin (Apologia, i. 65, 67). The
          principle, that the Eucharist should be received only fasting,
          which would exclude any relation with a preceding common meal,
          and especially with the agape, taking place toward evening, is
          indirectly evidenced by Tertullian (Ad uxorem, ii. 5); Augustine
          found it so universally recognized that he was inclined to refer
          it to one of the ordinances promised by Paul in I Cor. xi. 34;
          and Chrysostom was so convinced of the antiquity of the rule
          that he supposed the custom of following it by an ordinary meal
          to have prevailed in Corinth in Paul's time. In any case, in the
          third and fourth centuries the development of the agape was more
          and more away from any connection with public worship.

  2. Final Form of the Agape.

          From the indications of the Syriac Didascalia and the Egyptian
          liturgical books, as well as the canons of the Councils of
          Gangra and Laodicea it may be inferred that the giving of these
          feasts and the inviting to them of widows and the poor was, in
          the East, one of the forms usually taken by the benevolence of
          the wealthier members of the Church. The bishop and other clergy
          were invited, and, if they appeared, were received with special
          honor and charged with the direction of the assembly. These
          feasts were given at irregular times and in various places,
          sometimes in the church itself. This was forbidden by the
          twenty-eighth canon of Laodicea, at the same time that the
          fifty-eighth prohibited their celebration in private houses.
          Secular festivities in connection with the agapæ, which brought
          upon them the condemnation of the ascetic Eustathians (against
          whom the Council of Gangra defended them), caused them to be
          regarded more and more among the orthodox also as incompatible
          with the dignity of divine worship, so that they gradually
          became entirely separate from it, and thus tended to fall into
          disuse.

          How popular these feasts were in Africa, in the churches, in the
          chapels of the martyrs, and at the graves of other Christians,
          may be seen from the often renewed canon of Hippo (393), which
          forbids clerics to eat in churches except in dispensing
          hospitality to travelers, and commands them as far as possible
          to restrain the people from such meals. The same thing appears
          in Augustine's descriptions as well as in the great pains he
          took to repress grave abuses and, with reference to the practise
          of the Italian and almost all the other churches, to suppress
          the agapæ altogether.

  3. Disassociation of Agape and Eucharist.

          It is not clear what caused the disassociation of the agape from
          the Eucharist in the first half of the second century. It is a
          misunderstanding of Pliny's letter to Trajan (Epist., xcvi.) to
          suppose that in consequence of the prohibition of hetæriæ
          ("brotherhoods") the Christians then abandoned their evening
          feasts and transferred the Eucharist to the morning; but it is
          very probable that the constant accusation of impious customs
          which recalled the stories of Thyestes and of OEdipus were the
          main reason for the separation of the Eucharist, which was an
          essential part of their public worship, from the connection, so
          liable to be misunderstood, with an evening meal participated in
          by both sexes and all ages. The fact that at one time the two
          were connected is evidenced not only by Pliny, but about the
          same time by the Didache, in which, whatever one may think about
          the relation of the eucharistic prayers to the accompanying
          liturgical acts (chaps. ix-x.), the opening passage of the
          second prayer (Gk. meta de to emplesthenai) shows that a full
          meal belonged to the rite there referred to. Just as here the
          Greek word eucharistia, which from Justin down is employed as a
          technical term for the sacrament, at least includes a common
          meal, which is found separated from the sacrament after the
          middle of the second century, so Ignatius, with whom eucharistia
          is a usual designation of the sacrament, also employs agape and
          agapan to denote the same observance. It is accordingly safe to
          conclude that in the churches, from Antioch to Rome, with which
          Ignatius had to do, the so-called agape was connected with the
          Eucharist, as Pliny shows at the same time for Bithynia and the
          Didache for Alexandria. The same may be inferred of the two
          Scriptural passages cited above; and one is led further back by
          I Cor. xi. 17-34. While Paul distinguishes as sharply as
          possible the eating of the one bread and the drinking of the
          blessed chalice from common food and drink (I Cor. x. 3, 16; xi.
          23-29), he shows at the same time that in Corinth the two were
          connected in thought. While he rebukes the disorder of one
          drinking too much and another going hungry, so as to injure the
          dignity of the following sacrament, and lays down that eating
          for the mere satisfaction of hunger ought to take place at home
          and not in the assembly of the brethren, he is not disposed (as
          I Cor. xi. 33 shows) to abolish altogether the connection of the
          sacrament with an actual meal. This connection, then, existing
          into the first decades of the second century, forms the basis of
          the history for both Eucharist and agape which diverge from that
          time on.

          (T. Zahn.)

          The agape or love-feast is practised at present by Mennonites,
          Dunkards, German Baptists of the Anglo-American type, and other
          religious bodies. For an able, but not wholly successful,
          attempt to prove that the Lord's Supper in the apostolic time
          was identical with the agape, i.e., that it was nothing but a
          social feast for the manifestation of brotherly love, consult
          Norman Fox, Christ in the Daily Meal (New York, 1898).

   Agapetus
          AGAPETUS, ag´´a-pî´tus: The name of two popes.

          Agapetus I.: Pope 535-536. He was the son of a Roman priest
          named Gordianus, who had been killed in the disturbances under
          Symmachus. Six days after the death of John II. he was chosen to
          succeed him, probably by the wish of Theodahad, king of the
          Ostrogoths. He began his pontificate by reconciling the
          contending factions among the Roman clergy and annulling the
          anathema pronounced by Boniface II. against the antipope
          Dioscorus. His decision, induced by the decrees of the North
          African synod, forbidding the entrance of converted Arians to
          the priesthood, and his defense of this measure in a letter to
          the emperor Justinian show him to have been a zealous upholder
          of orthodoxy. In 536 he was sent to Constantinople by Theodahad
          to try to establish peace with the emperor, and was obliged to
          pledge the sacred vessels of the Roman Church to obtain money
          for his journey. He did not succeed in the ostensible purpose of
          his mission, but accomplished more for the orthodox cause.
          Anthimus, patriarch of Constantinople, a secret adherent of
          Monophysitism, had, by the aid of the empress Theodora, the
          patroness of the Monophysites, been allowed, in defiance of the
          canons, to exchange the see of Trapezus (Trebizond) for the
          patriarchal throne. Agapetus refused all communion with him, and
          persisted so strenuously in his attitude, in spite of threats
          from the court, that he finally convinced Justinian that
          Anthimus had deceived him, and had him deposed, and replaced by
          Mennas. Agapetus himself consecrated Mennas by wish of the
          emperor, and apparently with the assent of the principal
          orthodox Eastern bishops, after he had presented a confession of
          faith which the pope considered satisfactory. The emperor,
          fearing lest he himself should be accused of sympathy with the
          former Monophysite patriarch, placed a confession of faith in
          the pope's hands, which Agapetus approved in a letter plainly
          showing how important he felt his triumph to be. Almost
          immediately afterward he fell ill and died in Constantinople
          Apr. 22, 536, his body being brought to Rome and buried in St.
          Peter's.

          Agapetus II.: Pope 946-955. He was a Roman by birth, and, like
          his predecessor Marinus II. owed his elevation to the papal
          throne (May 10, 946) to Alberic, the secular master of Rome.
          Though hampered at home by Alberic's power, he asserted the
          claims of his see successfully abroad. He intervened in the
          prolonged contest over the archbishopric of Reims, from which
          Heribert of Vermandois had expelled the legitimate incumbent,
          Artold, to give it to his own son Hugh. The contest between the
          friends of the two prelates attained the dimensions of a civil
          war, Artold being supported by Louis IV. of France. Agapetus
          also took Artold's side at first; but he was deceived by the
          representations of a cleric from Reims into reversing his
          decision. After Artold had succeeded in enlightening him, the
          affair was referred to a synod held at Ingelheim in 948, whose
          final verdict in favor of Artold was confirmed by Agapetus in a
          Roman synod (949). [When Berengar II., Marquis of Ivrea,
          attempted to unite all Italy under his scepter, the pope and
          other Italian princes appealed to Otho I., who went as far as
          Pavia, expecting to be crowned emperor; but Agapetus, influenced
          by Alberic, turned away from him.] In 954 Alberie took an oath
          from the Roman nobles that at the next vacancy they would elect
          as pope his son and heir, Octavian; and when Agapetus died in
          December, 955, Octavian did in fact succeed him as John XII.

   Agapios Monachos
          AGAPIOS MONACHOS, a-g??´pi-os mo-n??´kos ("Agapios the Monk";
          Athanasio Lando): Ascetic writer of the Greek Church; b. at
          Candia, Crete, toward the end of the sixteenth century; d.
          between 1657 and 1664. After a wandering life he took up his
          abode in the monastery on Mt. Athos, but he found it hard to
          submit to the strict discipline there. He is one of the most
          popular religious writers of the Greeks. By his excellent
          translations from the Latin, ancient Greek, and Italian into the
          vernacular he made many devotional works of the nations
          accessible to his people. He meant to be orthodox, but was
          influenced by Roman Catholicism, and in his works he
          unsuspectingly quotes Peter Damian and Albertus Magnus besides
          Ambrose, Augustine, and others. In penance he distinguishes
          between the contritio, satisfactio, and confessio; and in the
          Lord's Supper he accepts the doctrine of transubstantiation
          without using that term. The question of his orthodoxy was
          seriously debated in the seventeenth century by the fathers of
          Port Royal and representatives of the Reformed Church (cf. J.
          Aymon, Monumens authentiques de la Religion des Grecs, The
          Hague, 1708, pp. 475, 599).

          The most important of the works of Agapios is the "Salvation of
          Sinners" (1641), a devotional book for the people. His "Sunday
          Cycle" (1675), a collection of sermons, was also much prized.
          His writings went through many editions, especially those
          containing biographies of the saints; as the "Paradise" (1641),
          the "New Paradise" (c. 1664), the "Selection" (1644), and the
          "Summertide" (1656). The first three contain translations from
          Symeon Metaphrastes.

   Agatha, Saint
          AGATHA, ag´?-th?, SAINT: Virgin and martyr in the Roman Catholic
          calendar. The accounts of her given in the Latin and Greek Acta
          (ASB, Feb., i. 595-656) are so largely made up of legendary and
          poetical matter that it is impossible to extract solid
          historical facts from them. The fact of her martyrdom is,
          however, attested by her inclusion in the Carthaginian calendar
          of the fifth or sixth century and in the so-called Martyrologium
          Heroinymianum; and she is mentioned also by Damasus, bishop of
          Rome from 366 to 384 (Carmen, 30). There seems no reason to
          doubt that she suffered at Catania on Feb. 5; but the year of
          her death can not be determined. She is venerated particularly
          in southern Italy and in Sicily, where, in many places, she is
          invoked as a protectress against eruptions of Mount Etna. The
          cities of Palermo and Catania still contend for the honor of
          being her birthplace.

   Agatho
          AGATHO, ag´?-tho: Pope 678-681. He was a Sicilian monk, and in
          June or July, 678, succeeded Donus after a vacancy in the papacy
          of two and one-half months. He is especially celebrated for the
          decisive part which he took in the Monothelite controversy (see
          [145]Monothelites). He succeeded also in inducing Theodore of
          Ravenna to acknowledge the dependence of his church on that of
          Rome. At a synod held in Rome at Easter, 679, he decreed the
          restoration of [146]Wilfrid, archbishop of York, who had been
          deposed by Theodore of Tarsus, archbishop of Canterbury. The
          financial resources of the Roman see appear to have been very
          limited during his pontificate; for he not only attempted to
          administer in person the office of arcarius or treasurer of the
          Roman Church, but he persuaded the emperor to renounce the
          payment which had been demanded for the confirmation of a pope,
          though the imperial approbation was still required. Agatho died
          Jan. 10, 681; the Roman Church honors his memory on that day;
          the Greek on Feb. 20.

   Agde, Synod of
          AGDE, ?gd, SYNOD OF: A synod which met Sept. 11, 506, at Agde
          (Lat. Agatha), a town on the Mediterranean coast of France (90
          m. w. of Marseilles, of which it was originally a colony). The
          town is unimportant, though it claimed to possess the relics of
          St. Andrew. The synod met with the permission of Alaric II.,
          king of the West Goths, and thirty-five bishops from the south
          of France attended, Cæsarius of Arles presiding. It passed
          forty-seven canons relating to questions of discipline, the
          guardianship of church property, the devout life, and--a matter
          of no slight importance for the south of France--the position of
          the Jews. An attempt was made to enforce clerical celibacy; and
          an almost suspicious attitude was assumed in regard to female
          monasticism (nuns were not to take the veil before the age of
          40; no new convents were to be founded without the permission of
          the bishop; and the solitary life was disapproved). Provision
          was made for the maintenance of several traditional customs,
          such as the strict fast in Lent, the traditio symboli on the
          Saturday before Easter, the communion of the laity at Christmas,
          Easter, and Pentecost; an effort was made to secure liturgical
          uniformity. In regard to the Jewish question, it is observable
          that here, as elsewhere, there was no distinction in social life
          between Jews and Christians, but that the Church disapproved of
          intercourse with the Jews, and looked with some distrust on
          converts from Judaism. The canons of the synod are based upon
          older and not exclusively Gallic foundations: Spanish and
          African conciliar decisions are used, as well as the letter of
          Pope Innocent I. to Exsuperius of Toulouse. In like manner the
          canons of the First Frankish Synod at Orléans (511) and the
          Burgundian Synod at Epao (517) depend upon those of Agde. The
          latter were early included in the collections of church law, and
          Gratian incorporated a large part of them in his Decretum.

   Age, Canonical
          AGE, CANONICAL: The age required by the canons of the Church for
          ordination or for the performance of any particular act. The
          requirement of a definite age for entering the priestly order is
          first found in the eleventh canon of the Synod of Neocæsarea
          (314 or 325): "No one is to be ordained priest before he is
          thirty years old . . . for Jesus Christ when thirty years old
          was baptized and entered upon his ministry." The first canon of
          the second series of canons of the Synod of Hippo in 393
          required the completion of the twenty-fifth year for the
          reception of deacon's orders. These decisions were frequently
          repeated as by the Synods of Agde (506, canon xvi.), of Arles
          (524, canon i.), the Third Synod of Orléans (538, canon vi.),
          and the Fourth of Toledo (633, canon xx.), and the later
          repetitions were included in the canonical collections of the
          early Middle Ages, but in detail they were frequently changed.
          Urban II. at the Council of Melfi (1089, canon iv.) laid down
          the law that no one should be ordained subdeacon before his
          fourteenth year, or deacon before his twenty-fourth. For the
          priesthood, though the thirtieth year still remained the minimum
          in the written law, the practise grew of ordaining at
          twenty-five. The Synod of Ravenna (1314, canon ii.) fixed the
          sixteenth year for subdeacons, the twentieth for deacons, and
          the twenty-fourth for priests. Finally the Council of Trent
          (1563, session xxiii.) settled the minimum at twenty-two,
          twenty-three, and twenty-four years, respectively, for these
          offices. It is sufficient to have begun the year specified in
          the Council. For tonsure and minor orders the Council simply
          requires the reception of the sacrament of confirmation and a
          certain degree of learning. In the Protestant Churches the
          attainment by the candidate of his majority is usually
          considered sufficient, though here and there the twenty-fourth
          year is still required.

          In the Roman Catholic Church the canonical age is reckoned from
          the day of birth. Canonically the age of discretion is put at
          seven years, and then the sacraments of penance and extreme
          unction may be received because the child, being supposed to be
          capable of conscious choice, can commit a mortal sin; also the
          child is then subject to the regulations of the Church
          respecting abstinence and attendance on mass, and may also, as
          far as law is concerned, contract a marriage engagement. A
          marriage may not be contracted before puberty (except in case of
          extraordinary development of mind and body), i.e., before
          fourteen for boys and twelve for girls; nor may confirmation and
          the Lord's Supper be received till the child has been properly
          instructed. From twenty-one to sixty is the period when fasting
          at certain seasons is obligatory. The lowest canonical age for a
          bishop is thirty years completed. The minimum age at which
          simple vows may be taken is sixteen years completed. Clerics may
          not profess solemn vows before they have entered on their
          twentieth year.

  1. The Term; its Equivalents Before the Reformation.

          The name Agenda ("Things to be Done"; Germ. Agende or
          Kirchenagende) is given, particularly in the Lutheran Church, to
          the official books dealing with the forms and ceremonies of
          divine service. It occurs twice in the ninth canon of the Second
          Synod of Carthage (390; Bruns, Canones, i., Berlin, 1839, p.
          121), and in a letter of Innocent I. (d. 417; MPL, xx. 552). The
          name was frequently employed in a more specific sense, as Agenda
          missarum, for the celebration of the mass; agenda diei, for the
          office of the day; agenda mortuórum, for the service for the
          dead; agenda matutina, and agenda vespertina, for morning and
          evening prayers. As the designation of a book of liturgical
          formulas it is stated by Ducange to have been used by Johannes
          de Janua, but in the only published work of Johannes (c. 1287)
          the name does not occur. There is no doubt, however, that with
          the development of the ritual of the Church the classification
          of liturgical formulas for the use of the parochial clergy
          became common. Such books of procedure were known by various
          names; e.g., manuale, obsequiale, benedictionale, rituale, and
          agenda. The last title was given especially to the church books
          of particular dioceses wherein the general ritual of the Church
          was supplemented by ceremonial features of local origin, as the
          agenda for Magdeburg of 1497, or the Liber agendarum secundum
          ritum ecclesiæ et diocesis Sleswicensis of 1512. The use of the
          term in the Roman Catholic Church, however, practically ceases
          with the Reformation, though a few instances occur in the
          sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. In the Evangelical
          Churches, on the contrary, with the title Kirchenbuch, it
          speedily came to be the accepted designation for authoritative
          books of ritual. In the early days of the Reformation the agenda
          not infrequently constituted part of the Kirchenordnung or
          general church constitutions of a state (see [147]Church Order);
          but in the course of time the separation of the formulas of
          worship from the legal and administrative codes of the Church
          was effected.

  2. Lutheran Changes in Roman Catholic Agenda.

          The earliest attempts at a reformation of the Roman ritual were
          naturally concerned with the mass. The innovations consisted of
          the omission of certain parts of the Roman ceremonial and the
          substitution of German for Latin, instances of the use of the
          vernacular in the celebration of the mass occurring as early as
          1521-22. In 1523 Luther published his Latin mass, revised in
          accordance with evangelical doctrine; and three years later he
          gave to the world his Deutsche Mese und Ordnung des
          Gottesdiensts, the use of which, however, was not made
          obligatory. In the same year appeared his "Book of Baptism," in
          1529 probably his "Book of Marriage," and during the years
          1535-37 the formula for the ordination of ministers. In the
          Kirchenordnungen of the time orders of worship occur, as in
          Thomas Münzer's Deutzsch kirchen ampt, of 1523, and the
          Landesordnung of the duchy of Prussia in 1525. From this time to
          the end of the sixteenth century the Protestant states of
          Germany were busied with the task of remodeling their
          ecclesiastical systems and formularies of worship, the work
          being carried on by the great theologians of the age. The church
          constitutions and agenda of this period may be divided into
          three classes: (1) those following closely the Lutheran model;
          (2) those in which the ideas of the Swiss Reformation were
          predominant; and (3) those which retained appreciable elements
          of the Roman ritual. Of the first type the earliest examples are
          the constitutions drawn up by Bugenhagen for Brunswick, 1528;
          Hamburg, 1529; Lübeck, 1531; Pomerania, 1535; Denmark, 1537;
          Sleswick-Holstein, 1542; and Hildesheim, 1544. Justus Jonas
          formulated the church laws of Wittenberg (in part), 1533; of the
          duchy of Saxony (where the name "agenda" is first adopted),
          1539; and of Halle, 1541. Hanover received its laws from Urbanus
          Rhegius in 1536; Brandenburg-Nuremberg, from Osiander and Brenz
          in 1533; and Mecklenburg, from Riebling, Aurifaber, and
          Melanchthon in 1540 and 1552. Among the states which adopted
          constitutions of the Reformed type were Hesse and Nassau,
          between 1527 and 1576; more closely, Württemberg, 1536; the
          Palatinate, 1554; and Baden, 1556. In the so-called "Cologne
          Reformation," drawn up largely by Butzer and Melanchthon and
          introduced by Archbishop Hermann in 1543, the agenda of Saxony,
          Brandenburg-Nuremberg, and Cassel served as models. The Roman
          ritual was retained to some extent in the church ordinances of
          the electorate of Brandenburg, 1540; Pfalzneuburg, 1543; and
          Austria, 1571. Of this type, too, were the ordinances drawn up
          by Melanchthon, Bugenhagen, Major, and others, for the
          electorate of Saxony in 1549; but these never went into effect,
          giving place in 1580 to a constitution Lutheran in character.

          The Thirty Years' war exercised a disastrous influence on the
          entire ecclesiastical system of Germany, and particularly on
          church discipline. The work of restoration, however, was begun
          almost immediately after the cessation of hostilities, but so
          great was the moral degradation in which the mass of the people
          was plunged, so low was the standard of education and general
          intelligence, that in the formulation of new ecclesiastical laws
          the governments, of necessity, assumed a far larger share of
          authority over the affairs of the Church than they had possessed
          before the war. This increased power of the government was
          apparent not only in a closer supervision over the
          ecclesiastical administration, but also in the enforcement of a
          stricter adherence to the formulated modes of worship. Of the
          agenda promulgated after the war, the most important were those
          of Mecklenburg, 1650; Saxony and Westphalia, 1651;
          Brunswick-Lüneburg, 1657; Hesse, 1657; and Halle, 1660.

          The eighteenth century witnessed a marked decline in the
          importance of the official liturgies in the religious life of
          the nation--a loss of influence so great as to make the books of
          the Church practically obsolescent. This was due to the rise of
          the pietistic movement which, in its opposition to formula and
          rigidity in doctrine, was no less destructive of the old ritual
          than was the rationalistic movement of the latter half of the
          century. Both pietism and rationalism were wanting in respect
          for the element of historical evolution in religion and worship;
          and the former, in laying stress on the value of individual
          prayer and devotion without attempting any change in the forms
          of divine service, led to their general abandonment for the
          spiritual edification that was to be obtained in the societies
          organized for common improvement, the so-called collegia
          pietatis. Rationalism in lending its own interpretation to the
          ritual, deprived it of much of its practical bearing, and
          necessitated, in consequence, a radical reconstruction of the
          prayers and hymns of the Church. But a no less important cause
          of change in liturgical forms is to be found in the growth of
          social distinctions and in the rise of a courtly etiquette which
          sought, with success, to impose its standards of manners and
          speech on the ceremonies and language of the Church. The
          etiquette of the salon entered the Church, and the formula "Take
          thou and eat," at the Lord's Supper, was altered to "Take Ye and
          eat" when the communicants were of the nobility. The consistory
          of Hanover in 1800 granted permission to its ministers to
          introduce during public worship such changes in language,
          costume, and gesture as would appeal to the tastes of their
          "refined audiences." As a result the old official agenda passed
          generally out of use and were replaced by books of worship
          representing the views of individual ministers.

  4. The Agenda in the Reformed Church.

          In the Evangelical Churches outside of Germany books of ritual
          were drawn up during the early years of the Reformation. In 1525
          Zwingli published the order of the mass as celebrated at Zurich
          and a formula of baptism based on the "Book of Baptism," issued
          by Leo Judæ in 1523. A complete agenda, including the two
          Zwinglian codes, appeared at Zurich in 1525 (according to
          Harnack and others, but more probably in 1529), under the title
          Ordnung der Christenlichen Kilchenn zü Zürich, and was often
          revised during the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Bern
          received its first formulary in 1528; Schaffhausen, in 1592, and
          St. Gall in 1738. Neuchatel, in 1533, was the first
          French-speaking community to adopt a definite ritual; its
          authorship has been attributed to Farel. At Geneva, Calvin
          published in 1542, La Forme des prières ecclésiastiques, based
          on the practises he had found among the French of Strasburg
          during his sojourn in that city from 1538 to 1541. The Strasburg
          ritual was followed also by the French in London, and by many
          churches in France itself. Deserving of special mention are the
          constitutions drawn up in 1550 by Johannes a Lasco for the
          fugitives from the Netherlands resident in England. They form
          the first comprehensive formulation of the ritual of Calvinistic
          Protestantism, and are still in force in the Netherland Church.

  5. Revival of Agenda by Frederick William III.

          In Germany the return to a uniform, authoritative mode of
          worship was begun by Frederick William III. of Prussia in the
          early years of the nineteenth century. After 1613 the royal
          family of Prussia were adherents of the Reformed creed, but the
          king's personal beliefs were entirely Lutheran. After the
          campaign of Jena (1806) he entrusted the task of drafting a
          ritual to Eylert, whose work, however, failed to receive the
          king's approval because the author had fallen into the then
          common error of the writers of liturgies, namely, of paying
          little regard to the historical development of the evangelical
          forms of worship. Frederick William protested vehemently against
          these newly fabricated rituals, and asserted the necessity of
          "going back to Father Luther." With this purpose he devoted many
          years to the personal study of ritualistic history and attained
          an expert knowledge of the subject, particularly of its phases
          in the sixteenth century. The refusal of the great mass of the
          clergy to lend themselves to his efforts in favor of unity, he
          met with the determination to make use of the power vested in
          him by law to bring about the desired end. In 1822 he published
          the agenda for the court and cathedral church of Berlin; and two
          years later this formulary, increased and revised with the aid
          of Borowsky and Bunsen, was submitted to the various
          consistories. Before the end of 1825, out of 7,782 churches
          within the Prussian dominions, 5,243 had adopted the proposed
          regulations. In spite of a bitter polemic, in which
          Schleiermacher led the assault on the king's innovations, the
          new regulations were introduced in all the provinces before
          1838.

  6. The Agenda in the Modern Lutheran Church.

          The king's agenda, however, did not cease to be the subject of
          much criticism. In 1856 it was improved; and in 1879 the General
          Synod determined upon a thorough revision. The work was
          entrusted to a committee of twenty-three, among whom were the
          theologians Goltz, Kleinert, Hering, Meuss, Renner, Rübesamen,
          Kögel, and Schmalenbach; and in 1894 their draft of a new ritual
          was adopted with slight changes by the General Synod. The lead
          of Prussia was followed by the other members of the German
          Empire, and most of the states have now revised their agenda or
          have the work in progress. Bohemia and Moravia (both Lutherans
          and Calvinists), Denmark, Norway, Poland, Russia, Sweden, and
          Transylvania have also late revisions. In France, after much
          agitation, a book of ritual, Liturgie des Églises reformées, de
          France revisées par le Synode général, was adopted in 1897.

          (Georg Rietschel.)

  7. American Liturgies.

          The Church of England adopted the Book of Common Prayer under
          Edward VI., which, with slight revisions, has been made
          universally obligatory by acts of uniformity. It is used with
          modifications by the Protestant Episcopal Church of the United
          States (see [148]Common Prayer, Book of). H. M. Mühlenberg
          prepared a liturgy which was adopted by the Lutheran Synod that
          he had organized (1748) and approved by the German Lutheran
          authorities at Halle, whose missionary he was. It was based upon
          those in use in Lüneburg (1643 onward), Calenberg (1569 onward),
          Brandenburg-Magdeburg (1739 onward), and Saxony (1712 onward).
          The liturgy of the Savoy Lutheran Church of London was the only
          one, apparently, actually in hand, the others exerting their
          influence through Mühlenberg's memory (for text cf. H. E.
          Jacobs, A History of the Lutheran Church in the United States,
          New York, 1893, pp 269-275; cf. also Schmucker, in the Lutheran
          Church Review, i., pp. 16-27, 161-172). Forms for baptism and
          the marriage ceremony were taken from the Prayer-Book of the
          Church of England. In 1795 Kunze published A Hymn and Prayer
          Book for the use of such Lutheran Churches as use the English
          Language, which has by successive revisions developed into the
          present English Church Book. In 1806 the New York ministerium
          adopted a liturgy modified by Episcopal influence, and in 1818
          the Philadelphia ministerium adopted a liturgy in which
          extemporaneous prayer was allowed as well as freedom in
          selecting the Scriptures to be read. In 1885 after much
          controversy and conference the General Synod adopted a "Common
          Service," which has been widely accepted by the Churches, but is
          not regarded as obligatory.

          The Dutch Reformed Church in the United States adopted (1771)
          along with the Belgic Confession, the Heidelberg Catechism, and
          the Canons of the Synod of Dort, the liturgical forms that were
          at that time in use in the Netherlands. The Nicene and
          Athanasian creeds are appended to the liturgy, which has
          undergone little change. The German Reformed Church in the
          United States seems to have used the Palatinate liturgy, with
          local modifications. In 1841 the Eastern Synod published a
          liturgy prepared by Lewis Mayer, which, however, failed of
          general approval. A "Provisional Liturgy," prepared by Philip
          Schaff and others (1857), likewise proved unacceptable. The
          "Order of Worship" was allowed by the General Synod (1866) as
          was also the "Western Liturgy" (1869). The "Directory of
          Worship" was adopted in 1887 (cf. E. T. Corwin, History of the
          Reformed Church, Dutch, and J. H. Dubbs, History of the Reformed
          Church, German, New York, 1895). A book of liturgical forms,
          prepared by Henry Van Dyke and others appointed by the General
          Assembly, for use in Presbyterian Churches, but in no way
          obligatory, was published in 1906. It aroused considerable
          opposition.

   Agilbert

          (Dorchester) and afterward of Paris; b. in Gaul, probably in
          Paris; d. at Jouarre (35 m. e. of Paris) Oct. 11, 680; he
          studied in Ireland, and went to Wessex about 650, where King
          Cenwealh appointed him bishop to succeed Birinus (he had
          received consecration before leaving Gaul). As he could not
          speak English, Cenwealh chose another bishop, Wine, whom he
          located (probably in 663) in his royal city, Winchester, where
          he had founded a church soon after his conversion in 646.
          Agilbert then returned to Gaul, passing through Northumbria and
          attending the [150]Synod of Whitby on the way. He became bishop
          of Paris not before 666. He assisted at the consecration of
          Wilfrid as bishop of York (664 or 665), and entertained Theodore
          of Tarsus while on his way to Canterbury. After a time Cenwealh
          invited him to return to Wessex; but he declined, and sent his
          nephew Hlothhere, or Leutherius, who was consecrated in 670 by
          the archbishop of Canterbury.

   Agliardi, Antonio
          AGLIARDI, ??´´glî´´??r´dî, ANTONIO: Cardinal; b. at Cologno al
          Serio (8 m. s.s.e. of Bergamo), Lombardy, Italy, Sept. 4, 1832.
          After a pastorate of twelve years in his native city, he was
          called to Rome and appointed administrator of East Indian
          affairs in the College of the Propaganda, as well as professor
          of moral theology in the Collegium Urbanum. In the former
          capacity he was sent to India as apostolic delegate in 1884,
          after being consecrated titular bishop of Cæsarea in Palestine.
          Ill health forced him to return to Italy, but he was soon in
          India once more, and made a tour of the country which lasted
          five months. in 1887, after finally leaving India, he was for a
          time secretary for extraordinary ecclesiastical affairs, and was
          then successively papal nuncio at Munich and Vienna. In 1896 he
          was sent to Russia as ambassador extraordinary to attend the
          coronation of the czar, and in the same year received the
          cardinal's hat, while in 1899 he was made suburban bishop of
          Albano. In 1902 he was placed in charge of the estates of the
          College of the Propaganda, and since 1903 has been
          vice-chancellor of the Holy Roman Church.

   Agnellus
          AGNELLUS, ag´´nel´lus (called also Andrew): The historian of the
          Church of Ravenna; b. in that city early in the ninth century
          [some authorities say in 805, of a rich and noble family]; the
          year of his death is unknown. He entered the clerical state very
          early, and became abbot of the monasteries of St. Mary ad
          Blachernas and St. Bartholomew, both in Ravenna. He was ordained
          priest by Archbishop Petronacius (817-835). His reputation for
          learning induced his brother clergy to ask him to write the
          history of the local church, and he began his Liber pontificalis
          Ecclesiæ Ravennatis before 838, and finished it after 846. It
          follows the model of the Roman Liber pontificalis, giving a
          series of biographies of the bishops of Ravenna, beginning with
          Apollinaris, said to have been a disciple of St. Peter and to
          have died as a martyr July 23, 75 (or 78), in whose memory the
          Basilica in Classe at Ravenna was dedicated in the year 549. The
          last bishop mentioned is George, whose death falls apparently in
          846. The characteristics of the work are its strong tendency to
          the expression of local patriotism, and the interest which it
          shows in buildings, monuments, and other works of art. It is one
          of the earliest historical works to make an extensive use of
          architectural monuments as sources. Agnellus had little command
          of written documents; he availed himself of oral tradition
          wherever possible, and supplied its deficiencies by a
          well-meaning imagination.

   Agnes, Saint
          AGNES, SAINT: A saint commemorated in the Roman Church on Jan.
          21 and 28 (the Gelasian Liturgy giving the former; the
          Gregorian, the latter date), and in the Greek Church on Jan. 14
          and 21 and July 5. Since the oldest documents (the Calendarium
          Romanum, the Calendarium Africanum, and the Gothic and Oriental
          Missale) agree in fixing Jan. 21 as the day of her death,
          Bolland has rightly assigned to that day the acts of her
          martyrdom. The year of her death, according to Ruinart, was
          about 304. The cause and manner of her martyrdom are given in a
          very legendary manner by an undoubtedly spurious Passion in the
          older editions of the works of St. Ambrose, which states that,
          having made a vow of perpetual virginity while still a child,
          she successfully resisted the wooing of a noble youth, the son
          of Symphronius, the city prefect, and embellishes the narrative
          with many wonders. Her hair suddenly grew so long and thick as
          to serve for a cloak; a light from heaven struck her importunate
          lover lifeless to the ground; when she was bound to the stake
          the flames were extinguished in answer to her prayer. After she
          had been beheaded at the command of the prefect, and had been
          buried by her parents in their field on the Via Nomentana,
          outside of Rome, she appeared to her people in glorified form
          with a little lamb at her side, and continued to perform
          miracles, such as the healing of the princess Constantia, for
          which, it is said, she was honored under Constantine the Great
          by the erection of a basilica at her tomb (Sant' Agnese fuori le
          Mura). Evidence of the high antiquity of her worship is given by
          Ambrose in several of his genuine writings, by Jerome (Epist.,
          cxxx., ad Demetriadem), by Augustine, by the Christian poets
          Damasus and Prudentius, and by others.

          In medieval art St. Agnes is usually represented with a lamb,
          which indicates her character as representative of youthful
          chastity and innocence, but may have been derived from her name,
          which is to be connected with the Greek hagne, "chaste" (cf.
          Augustine, Sermones, cclxxiii. 6). Two lambs are blessed every
          year on Jan. 21 in the Agnes basilica, mentioned above (one of
          the principal churches of Rome, after which one of the cardinal
          priests is called), and their wool is used to make the
          archiepiscopal pallia which are consecrated by the pope (see
          [151]Pallium).

   Agnoetæ
          AGNOETÆ, ag´´no-î´tî or -ê´tê (Gk. agnoetai, "ignorant"): 1.
          Name of a sect of the fourth century, a branch of the
          [152]Eunomians, who followed the lead of Theophronius of
          Cappadocia. They were so named because they limited the divine
          omniscience to the present, maintaining that God knew the past
          merely by memory, and the future by divination (Socrates, Hist.
          eccl., v. 24).

          2. The name was borne also by the sect of the sixth century,
          founded by Themistius, a deacon of Alexandria, and sometimes
          called Themistians. They consisted chiefly of the Severian
          faction of the Monophysites, and maintained that, as the body of
          Christ was subject to natural conditions, so also his human soul
          must be thought of as not omniscient. In support of their view
          they quoted Mark xiii. 32 and John xi. 34. The heresy was
          revived by the Adoptionists in the eighth century.

   Agnosticism
          AGNOSTICISM: A philologically objectionable and philosophically
          unnecessary but very convenient term, invented toward the end of
          the nineteenth century (1869) as a designation of the skeptical
          habit of mind then quite prevalent. It is defined in the Oxford
          Dictionary as the doctrine which holds that "the existence of
          anything beyond and behind natural phenomena is unknown, and (so
          far as can be judged) unknowable, and especially that a First
          Cause and an unseen world are subjects of which we know
          nothing." It is thus equivalent to the common philosophical
          term, skepticism, although expressing the phase of thought
          designated by both alike from the point of view of its outcome
          rather than of its method. Some have held, it is true, that the
          true agnostic is not he who doubts whether human powers can
          attain to the knowledge of what really is, or specifically to
          the knowledge of God and spiritual things, but he who denies
          this. But there is a dogmatic skepticism, and there is no reason
          why there may not be a more or less hesitant agnosticism. The
          essential element in both is that the doubt or denial rests on
          distrust of the power of the human mind to ascertain truth. It
          is common, to be sure, to speak of several types of agnosticism,
          differing the one from the other according as the basis of the
          doubt or denial of the attainability of truth is ontological,
          generally psychological, definitely epistemological, or logical.
          But useful as this discrimination may be as a rough
          classification of modes of presenting the same fundamental
          doctrine, it is misleading if it suggests that the real basis of
          doubt or denial is not in every case epistemological. When it is
          said, for example, that God and spiritual things are in their
          very nature unknowable, that of course means that they are
          unknowable to such powers as man possesses; nothing that exists
          can be intrinsically unknowable, and if unknowable to men must
          be so only because of limitations in their faculties of
          knowledge. And when one is told that the sole trouble is that
          the balance of evidence is hopelessly in equilibrium, and the
          mind is therefore left in suspense, that of course means only
          that such minds as men have are too coarse scales for weighing
          such delicate matters.

          Agnosticism is in short a theory of the nature and limits of
          human intelligence. It is that particular theory which questions
          or denies the capacity of human intelligence to attain assured
          knowledge, whether with respect to all spheres of truth, or, in
          its religious application, with respect to the particular sphere
          of religious truth. As mankind has universally felt itself in
          possession of a body of assured knowledge, and not least in the
          sphere of religious truth,--nay as mankind instinctively reaches
          out to and grasps what it unavoidably looks upon as assured
          knowledge, and not least in the sphere of religious
          truth,--agnosticism becomes, in effect, that tendency of opinion
          which pronounces what men in general consider knowledge more or
          less misleading, and therefore more or less noxious. Sometimes,
          no doubt, in what we may, perhaps, call the half-agnostic, these
          illusions are looked upon as rough approximations to truth, and
          are given a place of importance in the direction of human life,
          under some such designation as "regulative truths" (Mansel), or
          "value judgments" (Ritschl), or "symbolical conceptions"
          (Sabatier). The consistent agnostic, however, must conceive them
          as a body of mere self-deceptions, from which he exhorts men to
          cleanse their souls as from cant (Huxley).

          In effect, therefore, agnosticism impoverishes, and, in its
          application to religious truth, secularizes and to this degree
          degrades life. Felicitating itself on a peculiarly deep
          reverence for truth on the ground that it will admit into that
          category only what can make good its right to be so considered
          under the most stringent tests, it deprives itself of the
          enjoyment of this truth by leaving the category either entirely
          or in great part empty. Refusing to assert there is no truth, it
          yet misses what Bacon declares "the sovereign good of human
          nature," viz., "the inquiry of truth, which is the love-making
          or wooing of it,--the knowledge of truth, which is the presence
          of it,--and the belief of truth which is the enjoying of it." On
          the ground that certain knowledge of God and spiritual things is
          unattainable, it bids man think and feel and act as if there
          were no God and no spiritual life and no future existence. It
          thus degenerates into a practical atheism. Refusing to declare
          there is no God, it yet misses all there may be of value and
          profit in the recognition of God.

   Agnus Dei
          AGNUS DEI, ag´nus dê´i ("Lamb of God"): 1. An ancient liturgical
          formula in the celebration of the Eucharist, found in some
          manuscripts of the Sacramentary of Gregory the Great after the
          Lord's Prayer and the Libera. The full text, based on John i.
          29, is "Agnus Dei, qui tollis peccata mundi, miserere nobis." It
          is found also in the ancient Eastern hymn which was annexed to
          the Gloria in Excelcis (see [153]Liturgical Formulas, II., 3)
          and was early introduced into the Western Church in Latin
          translation, where the form is "Domine Fili unigenite, Jesu
          Christe, Domine Deus, Agnus Dei, Filius Patris, qui tollis
          peccata mundi, miserere nobis; qui tollis peccata mundi, suscipe
          deprecationem nostram." When the Second Trullan Council (892)
          undertook to forbid the representation and invocation of Christ
          under the figure of the lamb, Pope Sergius I., to express the
          opposition of the Roman Church, decreed that the Agnus should be
          sung by priest and people at the Communion. After 787, under
          Adrian I., it was sung by the choir only. The ritual of the
          mass, based in this particular on a custom which can be traced
          to the beginning of the eleventh century, prescribes that the
          priest, before taking the sacrament, shall recite the Agnus Dei
          three times, bowing and beating his breast to express contrition
          for sin, the third time with the addition of "dona nobis pacem."
          The consecration precedes, the Lord's Prayer is sung with the
          Libera nos; a piece of the consecrated and broken bread is then
          thrown into the cup, and the Agnus follows. At the Church
          festivals it is accompanied with telling effect by soft and
          tender music. In the mass for the dead the words "give them
          rest" are substituted for "have mercy upon us," the third time
          with the addition of "eternal."

          The Agnus was accepted in the Evangelical Lutheran Church at the
          beginning, either in the translation of Nicolaus Decius, "O Lamm
          Gottes unschuldig," or in the more exact form, "Christe, du Lamm
          Gottes, der du trägst." In the days of rationalism it was often
          omitted, or the phrase "Son of God" was substituted for "Lamb of
          God," the latter being thought to imply an unchristian,
          Levitical sacrificial conception. It was afterward restored, and
          is now used in numerous musical settings. In the Church of
          England the Agnus was incorporated in the Litany, but only to be
          repeated twice; and the last form (ending with "grant us thy
          peace") was placed first. In the first prayer-book of Edward I.
          it was included in the communion office, but was omitted in that
          of 1552 and all subsequent revisions. Nevertheless, it is almost
          invariably sung by congregations of High-church affiliations.

          2. Name given to a wax medallion, bearing the figure of a lamb,
          made from the remains of the paschal taper, and consecrated by
          the pope in the special ceremonies on the Sunday after Easter in
          the first year of each pontificate and every seven years
          thereafter. These medallions are presented to distinguished
          individuals or to churches, are often enclosed in cases of
          costly workmanship, and are carefully preserved, almost like
          relics.

   Agobard
          AGOBARD, ag´o-b??rd: Archbishop of Lyons 816-840 [b., probably
          in Spain, 779; d. in Saintonge (an old province of western
          France) June 6, 840]. Nothing certain is known of his youth. He
          went to Lyons in 792, and probably owed his education to
          Leidrad, archbishop of Lyons, one of the most diligent of
          Charlemagne's helpers in his civilizing work. Later he became
          Leidrad's assistant, and then his successor. When the order of
          succession established by Louis le Débonnaire in 817, largely
          through ecclesiastical influence, was set aside at the
          instigation of the empress Judith (829), Agobard was one of its
          most zealous defenders. He seems to have taken no part in the
          rising of 830; but in 833 he appears among the professed
          opponents of Louis. He approved the deposition of the emperor,
          and was one of the bishops who forced him to his humiliating
          penance at Soissons. Consequently in 835, when Louis had
          recovered his power, Agobard was deprived of his office. He
          regained it later, being reconciled with Louis.

          Agobard takes a foremost place in the annals of Carolingian
          culture. In strictly theological treatises such as the Liber
          adversus dogma Felicis, against Adoptionism, and another,
          against image-worship, he is as much a mere compiler as any of
          his contemporaries. When, however, in a polemic against
          Fredegis, abbot of St. Martin at Tours, he deals with the
          question of inspiration, he speaks out boldly against the
          doctrine of verbal inspiration, while still declaring himself to
          be governed by the tradition of orthodox teachers. In his
          political writings he was less governed by traditional views. He
          was not afraid to touch one of the most difficult questions of
          the time, that of the restitution of Church property, at the
          diet held at Attigny in 822; and he renewed the demand in the
          tractate De dispensatione ecclesiarum rerum. His Comparatio
          utriusque regiminis ecclesiastici et politici (833) is one of
          the first writings in which the claim is outspokenly made that
          the emperor must do the bidding of the pope. He wrote a book
          against the popular superstition that storms could be caused by
          magic, basing his argument on religious grounds, yet making
          appeal to sound reason. In advance of his age, again, he denied
          absolutely the justice of the ordeal by battle, and wrote two
          tractates against it. He was also to some extent a liturgical
          scholar; and in the preface to his revised antiphonary laid down
          the principle that the words of Holy Scripture should alone be
          used.

   Agonizants
          AGONIZANTS (Agony Fathers; Fathers of the Good Death,
          Camillians, Clerici regulares ministrantes infirmis): A
          fraternity founded at Rome in 1584 to care for the sick and
          minister to the dying. The founder was a pious priest Camillus
          de Lellis (b. at Buchianico, in the Neapolitan province Abruzzo,
          May 25, 1550; d. at Rome July 14, 1614), who, after a wild life
          as a soldier, entered the hospital of St. James at Rome in 1574,
          suffering from an incurable wound. Becoming converted, he
          devoted the remainder of his life to heroic service in the
          hospitals of Rome, Naples, and elsewhere. He was canonized by
          Benedict XIV. in 1746, and his statue now stands, among those of
          great founders of orders, in St. Peter's between the statues of
          St. Peter of Alcantara and St. Ignatius Loyola. The society was
          confirmed by Sixtus V. in 1586; five years later, after the
          members had distinguished themselves during the plague of 1590,
          it was created by Gregory XIV. an order with Augustinian rule.
          It grew rapidly in numbers and wealth during the founder's
          lifetime, and in 1605 was divided by Paul V. into five
          provinces, Rome, Milan, Bologna, Naples, and Sicily. Afterward
          the order spread beyond Italy, especially in Spain and Portugal,
          and later in France and America. During the nineteenth century
          it met with opposition in certain countries (including Italy,
          where it had thirty-four houses); but it was favored by Leo
          XIII., who made St. Camillus and St. John of God (see
          [154]Charity, Brothers of) patrons of all Roman Catholic
          hospitals, and inserted their names in the litany of the dying.

   Agrapha
          AGRAPHA, ag´r0-f? ("Unwritten"): Name given to so-called sayings
          of Jesus not recorded in the Gospels, but reported by oral
          tradition. The term was first used by J. G. Körner in his De
          sermonibus Christi agraphois (Leipsic, 1776), in which he gives
          sixteen such agrapha. Since that time several collections of
          agrapha have been made; and the material seemed to have reached
          a climax in the work published by Alfred Resch, Agrapha:
          aussercanonische Evangelien-Fragmente in möglichster
          Vollständigkeit zusammengestellt und quellenkritisch untersucht
          (TU, v. 4, 1889; cf. J. H. Ropes, Die Sprüche Jesu . . . eine
          kritische Bearbeitung des von A. Resch gesammelten Materials,
          xiv. 2 of the same series, 1896). In 1897 Drs. B. P. Grenfell
          and A. S. Hunt discovered a papyrus page containing eight
          "sayings of Jesus" which are known as "the Oxyrhynchus Logia."
          In Feb., 1903, they came upon another papyrus fragment of a
          somewhat similar character, containing five additional "sayings
          of Jesus." Ropes divides the material found in Resch into five
          classes: (1) sayings which tradition has not considered agrapha;
          (2) passages erroneously quoted as sayings of the Lord; (3)
          worthless agrapha; (4) eventually valuable agrapha; (5) valuable
          agrapha. Such a classification is arbitrary and impossible; and
          even as to the number of agrapha scholars differ.

          Among the more noteworthy of the agrapha are:

          1. The sentence, "It is more blessed to give than to receive,"
          quoted by Paul (Acts xx. 35) as the "words of the Lord Jesus."
          No such saying is mentioned in the canonical Gospels. In the
          Teaching of the Apostles (i. 5) is found "happy is he that
          giveth according to the commandment"; and in the Apostolical
          Constitutions (iv. 3): "since even the Lord says, the giver was
          happier than the receiver.'" In Clement of Rome (Epist., i. 2),
          the same saying seems to be referred to under the form "more
          willing to give than to receive."

          2. "On the same day, having seen one working on the Sabbath, he
          said to him, O man, if indeed thou knowest what thou doest, thou
          art blessed; but if thou knowest not, thou art accursed and a
          transgressor of the law.'" This very remarkable saying occurs
          after Luke vi. 4 in Cod. D and in Cod. Græc. B. Rob. Stephani.

          3. "But ye seek to increase from little and from greater to
          less. When ye go and are bidden to dinner, sit not down in the
          highest seats, lest one grander than thou arrive, and the giver
          of the feast come and say to thee, Take a lower seat,' and thou
          be ashamed. But if thou sit down in the meaner place, and one
          meaner than thou arrive, the giver of the feast will say to
          thee, Go up higher'; and this shall be profitable to thee." This
          saying is found after Matt. xx. 28 in Cod. D, and in some other
          codices (cf. the New Testaments of Griesbach and Tischendorf ad.
          loc.).

          4. "Jesus said to his disciples Ask great things, and the small
          shall be added unto you; and ask heavenly things and the earthly
          shall be added unto you'" (Clement of Alexandria, Stromata, i.
          24; Origen, De Orat. libell., ii.; cf. Ambrose, Epist., xxxvi.
          3).

          5. "Rightly, therefore, the Scripture in its desire to make us
          such dialecticians, exhorts us: Be ye skilful money-changers,'
          rejecting some things, but retaining what is good" (Clement of
          Alexandria, Strom., i. 28). This is the most frequently quoted
          of all traditional sayings. Resch gives sixty-nine passages.

          6. "Let us resist all iniquity, and hold it in hatred," quoted
          as the words of Christ by Barnabas (Epist., iv.). In Epist.,
          vii. is found: "They who wish to see me and lay hold of my
          kingdom must receive me by affliction and suffering."

          7. "Our Lord Jesus Christ said, In whatsoever I may find you, in
          this will I also judge you.'" This saying, found in Justin
          Martyr (Trypho, xlvii., ANF, i., p. 219), is ascribed by Clement
          of Alexandria (Quis dives, xl.) to God; by Johannes Climacus
          (Scala paradisi, vii. 159; Vita B. Antonii, i. 15; Vita patrum,
          p. 41) to the prophet Ezekiel (cf. Ezek. vii. 3, 8; xviii. 30;
          xxiv. 14; xxxiii. 20, with Fabricius, Cod. Apocr., i. 333).
          These passages in Ezekiel, however, do not justify the
          quotation, and some apocryphal gospel is probably the authority
          for this saying.

          8. Among the sayings found in 1903 was the following: "Jesus
          saith, Let not him who seeks . . . cease until he finds, and
          when he finds he shall be astonished; astonished he shall reach
          the kingdom; and having reached the kingdom he shall rest.'"
          Another, with conjectural restoration of missing portions, is:
          "Jesus saith, [Ye ask, who are those] that draw us [to the
          kingdom, if] the kingdom is in heaven? . . . The fowls of the
          air, and all beasts that are under the earth or upon the earth,
          and the fishes of the sea [those are they which draw] you, and
          the kingdom of heaven is within you; and whoever shall know
          himself shall find it. [Strive therefore] to know yourselves,
          and ye shall be aware that ye are the sons of the [almighty]
          Father: [and] ye shall know that ye are in [the city of God],
          and ye are [the city].'"

   Agricola
          AGRICOLA: Pelagian writer; under the date 429 in his Chronicon,
          Prosper of Aquitaine mentions a British theologian of this name,
          the son of Severianus, a Pelagian bishop, saying that he
          corrupted the churches of Britain by his teaching, until Pope
          Celestine sent [156]Germanus, Bishop of Auxerre, to undo the
          mischief and bring back the Britons to the Catholic faith (cf.
          Bede, Hist. eccl., i. 17). Caspari has printed five unsigned
          letters and a tract on riches which are obviously all by the
          same Pelagian author, and has shown it to be probable that this
          is Agricola. From them it is learned that the author on his way
          to the East to learn the true ascetic life, heard the Pelagian
          ascetic teaching from a Roman lady in Sicily, and became a
          zealous preacher of it. The value of these writings lies in the
          glimpse which they give of the ethical side of Pelagianism.

   Agricola, Johann
          AGRICOLA, JOHANN: An associate of Luther, and the originator of
          the antinomian controversy of the German Reformation; b. at
          Eisleben Apr. 20, 1494 (according to his own account; others
          give 1492 or 1496); d. at Berlin Sept. 22, 1566. His real name
          was Schneider, first Latinized into "Sartor," then, from a
          corruption of "Schneider (Snider)" to "Schnitter," into
          "Agricola." He entered the University of Leipsic in the winter
          of 1509-10, with the intention of studying medicine, but Luther
          attracted him to theology. After taking his bachelor's degree,
          he went, in the winter of 1515-16, to Wittenberg, where he came
          wholly under Luther's influence. He witnessed the famous
          promulgation of the theses; and at the Leipsic disputation
          (1519) he acted as Luther's secretary. He soon became friendly
          with Melanchthon also, and an influential member of the little
          group of Wittenberg theologians. A modest income was provided
          for him by the position of teacher of grammar and the Latin
          classics in the Pædagogium; and before long he lectured on
          dialectics and rhetoric, and later on the New Testament.

    Schoolmaster in Eisleben.

          On the outbreak of the Peasants' War (1525), Agricola
          accompanied Luther to the Hartz Mountains, and gained from Count
          Albert of Mansfeld the nomination as head of the Latin school to
          be opened at Eisleben. This work, after a visit to Frankfort, as
          Luther's deputy, to help settle the ecclesiastical affairs of
          that place, he took up in Aug., 1525; and two catechetical books
          grew out of it, the second of which (1528) already exhibits the
          opposition between the Law and the Gospel which was to develop
          into his antinomian convictions. A commentary on the Epistle to
          Titus (1530) and a translation of Terence's Andria, with notes
          (1544), are doubtless other results of his school work. At
          Eisleben also he began his three collections of German proverbs,
          with explanations, which have ever since been popular. Certain
          critical remarks about Ulrich of Württemberg in the first of
          these collections involved Agricola in difficulties both with
          Ulrich and with his protector, Philip of Hesse, which were ended
          only by two successive apologies, prevented Luther from taking
          him to the Marburg conference, and influenced his bearing in the
          Schmalkald struggle. He had opportunities of preaching at St.
          Nicholas's church in Eisleben, and acquired the reputation of
          being one of the strongest pulpit orators of the Wittenberg
          circle, so that he was asked to attend the Diet of Speyer in
          1526 and 1529 and preach before the court. At this period also
          he made himself useful as a translator from the Latin, rendering
          among other things Melanchthon's commentary on several Pauline
          epistles.

    Controversies.

          His relations with Melanchthon were seriously disturbed in 1526.
          Soon after his departure from Wittenberg a new theological
          professorship was founded there, on which, with Melanchthon's
          encouragement, he set his heart. When it was conferred on the
          latter, Agricola's vanity received a wound which put an end to
          the cordiality of their friendship; and it is easy to understand
          why he began the antinomian controversy in 1527 with an attack,
          not on Luther, but on Melanchthon. Luther, however, whose
          relations with Agricola were still friendly, succeeded in
          effecting an apparent agreement. Agricola now fell out with
          Albert of Mansfeld. Differences arose over the measures to be
          taken for defense against the emperor and with regard to the
          treatment of matrimonial questions; and in 1536 Agricola was
          treating with Luther to secure a recall to Wittenberg. The
          elector promised him a speedy appointment to a university
          position, and meantime invited him to come to Wittenberg to give
          his counsel on the question of the Schmalkald articles. Agricola
          removed thither at Christmas, 1536. Albert, annoyed at the
          manner of his departure from Eisleben, accused him to the
          Wittenberg group as the founder of a new sect antagonistic to
          Luther, and to the elector as a turbulent fellow of the Münzer
          type. Luther stood by him, however, and even gave him and his
          family shelter in his own house; and when Luther went to
          Schmalkald in 1537, Agricola took his place both at the
          university and in the pulpit. Expressions used in some of his
          sermons, and the rumor that he was privately circulating
          antinomian theses containing attacks on Luther and Melanchthon,
          made him an object of suspicion. His antinomian disputes with
          Luther himself began; and after each apparent settlement they
          broke out with fresh violence (for details of the controversies
          see [157]Antinomianism, Antinomian Controversies, II.). He found
          employment in the newly founded Wittenberg consistory until
          Feb., 1539, when he formally accused Luther before the elector,
          who practically put him under arrest. Before the matter was
          settled he escaped to Berlin (Aug., 1540). At Melanchthon's
          suggestion and through Bugenhagen's mediation, he was allowed to
          retract his accusation and to return to Saxony. Cordial
          relations between the two men could, however, no longer exist:
          Luther never trusted Agricola again; and the latter, on his
          side, held that he remained true to the original cause, from
          which Luther had fallen away.

    Later Life.

          Joachim II. of Brandenburg gave Agricola a position as court
          preacher, and took him to the Conference of Regensburg (1541),
          the interim drawn up at which he considered a useful basis of
          unity. He followed his prince in the inglorious campaign against
          the Turks in 1542, and gained more and more influence over him,
          in spite of the efforts of Joachim's mother. He became general
          superintendent and visitor of Brandenburg, administering
          confirmation and ordination, though he himself had never
          received any kind of ordination. When the Schmalkald League took
          up arms against the emperor, Agricola attacked them in his
          sermons as disturbers of the peace, and gave thanks for the
          emperor's victory at Mühlberg, utterly failing to see the danger
          to the evangelical cause. It flattered his vanity when he was
          chosen as the Protestant theologian on the commission appointed
          at the Diet of Augsburg (1547-48) to draw up an interim; and he
          had the thankless task of endeavoring to persuade his fellow
          Protestants to accept it. The more strongly and increasingly
          they rejected it, the more animosity was concentrated on
          Agricola, who attempted to vindicate his Lutheran standing by
          the part which he took in the controversy with [158]Osiander;
          and the common cause brought him once more closer to
          Melanchthon. It fell to him to give judgment between Stancaro
          and [159]Andreas Musculus; and he pronounced in favor of the
          latter. The controversy on the necessity of good works raged for
          years in Brandenburg, and Agricola stoutly opposed the
          Philippists. For a while they seemed to prevail with Joachim,
          but the court swung round again to Agricola's side; and in 1563
          he was able to hold a thanksgiving service in Berlin for the
          final victory over his opponents--a victory for strict
          Lutheranism won mainly by the man whom Luther had despised. He
          died three years later, during an epidemic of the plague. He was
          undoubtedly a gifted man, though his rightful development was
          hindered by his vanity, which brought about the breach with
          Luther, and by the temptations of court life, which, as he
          himself recognized when too late, he had not sufficient strength
          of mind to resist.

   Agricola, Stephan
          AGRICOLA, STEPHAN (originally Castenpauer): A follower of
          Luther; b. in Abensberg (18 m. s.w. of Regensburg), Bavaria; d.
          at Eisleben Easter, 1547. He studied at Vienna, joined the
          Augustinians, gained fame as a preacher and teacher, and was
          promoted doctor of theology in 1519. Imitating St. Augustine, he
          preached on entire books of the Bible in Vienna in 1515, as
          lector in the Augustinian monastery at Regensburg in 1519-20,
          and in other places. His sermons brought him under suspicion. He
          was accused of preaching heretical, inflammatory, and offensive
          dogmas; of having recommended Luther's writings on the
          Babylonian captivity and on the abolition of the mass; of having
          spoken offensively of the Roman see, bishops, and clergy; and of
          having demanded the abolition of all ceremonies. He was
          imprisoned in 1522; thirty-three charges were made against him;
          and his answer, denying dependence upon Luther and making appeal
          to Augustine and the Scriptures, was of no avail. He prepared
          for death, and wrote Ein köstlicher gutter notwendiger Sermon
          vom Sterben (1523), which his friend Wolfgang Russ published. He
          escaped, however, found a home with the Carmelite Johann Frosch
          of Augsburg in 1523, and preached there from time to time. Not
          long after 1523 he published under the name of "Agricola Boius"
          Ein Bedencken wie der wahrhafftig Gottesdienst von Gott selbs
          geboten und aussgesetzt, möcht mit besserung gemeyner
          Christenheyt widerumb aufgericht werden, a kind of
          reformation-programme. Protected by the city council, he labored
          with Rhegius and Frosch for the Reformation in Augsburg, and
          became pronounced in his adherence to Luther's views as against
          Zwingli. By translating into German Bugenhagen's polemical
          treatise against Zwingli's Contra novum errorem de sacramentis
          (1525), he won over the Augsburg congregation to the Lutheran
          side. At the invitation of the landgrave Philip, he took part in
          the Marburg Colloquy and signed the articles agreed upon. In
          1531 he left Augsburg as he was opposed to Butzer's Zwinglian
          tendency and went to Nuremberg, where he stayed with Wenceslaus
          Link. In 1537 he attended the Schmalkald Diet and signed
          Luther's articles. When the Reformation was introduced into the
          Upper Palatinate, he accepted a call to Sulzbach where he
          preached the first evangelical sermon June 3, 1542. He afterward
          went to Eisleben.

   Agriculture, Hebrew
          AGRICULTURE, HEBREW: Palestine is praised in the Old Testament
          as a "land flowing with milk and honey"; and, indeed, with
          little labor it yielded what the inhabitants needed.

    Field and Garden Products.

          Of cereals, wheat was and is the most important product; the
          Ammonite country appears to have been specially noted for it (II
          Chron. xxvii. 5). The best wheat today is that of the Hauran and
          Belka, and of the high table-land between Tabor and the Lake of
          Tiberias. Much wheat was raised by the Hebrews in the time of
          Solomon, and then and later it was one of the chief articles of
          export (I Kings v. 11; Ezek. xxvii. 17). Barley was equally
          common and in the earlier time was the chief material for bread
          (Judges vii. 13; II Kings iv. 42). With progress in culture and
          the settled life its use was limited to the poorer classes (John
          vi. 9, 13; Josephus, War, V. x. 2). Today it is used for fodder
          only; it was also so used in the ancient time (I Kings iv. 28),
          and its value appears to have been about one-half that of wheat
          (II Kings vii. 1). There is no evidence in the Old Testament
          that beer was made from it. A third and less important cereal
          (Heb. kussemeth; LXX, olyra, Ex. ix. 32; Isa. xxviii. 25; Ezek.
          iv. 9; erroneously rendered "rye" in A. V.) was probably spelt.
          Rye and oats are not mentioned. The chief legume bearing plants
          were beans (II Sam. xvii. 28; Ezek. iv. 9) and lentils (Gen.
          xxv. 34; II Sam. xvii. 28, xxiii. 11; Ezek. iv. 9). Both were
          ground into meal, and were used for bread in time of scarcity
          (Ezek. iv. 9). Leeks, onions, and garlic were used as seasoning
          and to give relish to bread. Cucumbers and melons are also
          mentioned as delicacies of which the Israelites were deprived in
          the wilderness (Num. xi. 5). Both are particularly refreshing in
          hot countries, and the poor live for months on bread and
          cucumbers or melons alone. Of condiments and spices the Old
          Testament mentions two varieties of cumin (Heb. kammon, ?e?a?,
          Isa. xxviii. 25; the former used also as medicine) and the
          coriander (Ex. xvi. 31; Num. xi. 7, often mentioned in the
          Talmud). The New Testament adds: dill (Eng. versions, "anise,"
          Matt. xxiii. 23), mint (ib.; Luke xi. 42), rue (Luke xi. 42),
          and mustard (Matt. xiii. 31, xvii. 20; Mark iv. 31; Luke xiii.
          19, xvii. 6). The mustard-seed was proverbial as the smallest of
          seeds. The mustard plant grows quickly and reaches a height of
          ten feet. To these food-producing plants must be added flax
          (Josh. ii. 6; Isa. xix. 9; Hos. ii. 5, 9, and elsewhere) and
          cotton. The former of these is not much cultivated today; but it
          was of great importance to the ancient Israelites, as, together
          with wool, it supplied the material for their clothing. In the
          Greco-Roman period it was one of the chief articles of trade.
          The importance of the flax-cultivation can be inferred from the
          statement of the Talmud, that it was permissible to put a
          flax-bed under water on semi-holy days in order to destroy
          injurious insects (Moed Katan i. 6). Linen-manufacture was
          carried on especially in Galilee. How early the cotton-plant was
          introduced into Palestine is not known. The Hebrew terms shesh
          and buz do not necessarily mean linen, but include cotton cloth,
          or a mixed material like the Greek byssos. The foreign word
          karpas (Gk. karpasos) is used for cotton in Esther i. 6 and in
          the Talmud. In Greco-Roman times cotton was grown and exported
          (cf. Pausanias, V. v. 2). For wine and oil see the separate
          articles.

    Climatic Conditions.

          Palestine is praised in Deut. viii. 7, xi. 10-11, as a "land of
          brooks of water, of fountains and depths that spring out of
          valleys and hills," which has no need of artificial irrigation
          because it "drinketh water of the rain of heaven." Compared with
          the neighboring countries, it can not, indeed, be called poorly
          watered. In normal years the natural precipitation suffices for
          a great part of the fields. Land thus naturally watered is
          called in the Mishnah "house of the Baal" or "field of the house
          of the Baal," and the name is kept to this day (cf. Smith, Rel.
          of Sem., p. 97). But the ancient Israelites knew that
          watercourses and underground water were indispensable (cf. Ps.
          i.; Deut. viii. 7; Isa. xxxii. 20; Ezek. xvii. 8), and that the
          rain alone was not always sufficient; they therefore appreciated
          the pools made by the Canaanites and added to them (see
          [160]Water Supply in Palestine). For these favors of nature the
          Israelite ever felt his immediate dependence upon Yahveh (cf.
          Deut. xi. 14; Jer. iii. 3, v. 24; Joel ii. 23; Zech. x. 1).
          Yahveh's blessing shows itself in his sending the first rain and
          the latter rain in due season; in the rain his mercy is seen, in
          the drought his anger. Thus he proves himself indeed the Baal of
          the land, who waters and fertilizes it (cf. Smith, 1.c.).

    Cultivation.

          The Israelites learned agriculture from the Canaanites. How
          rapidly they made the transition from the nomadic stage can not
          be determined; it seems to have been practically complete at the
          beginning of the regal period (cf. I Sam. xi. 5; II Sam. xiv.
          30, which indicate that high and low were then engaged in the
          cultivation of the soil), although certain tribes of the south
          and the East-Jordan country retained more or less of the nomadic
          character till the Exile. That the religious observances,
          preeminently the great festivals, rest upon an agricultural
          basis is significant. Irrigation was not the only artificial
          improvement that was necessary. The land had to be cleared of
          thorns and weeds, and stones had to be removed (cf. Isa. v. 2;
          Matt. xiii. 3-7), although the fellahs to-day often allow the
          stones to remain because they help to retain moisture. Extensive
          terracing was indispensable to retain the thin soil on the steep
          hillsides. Manuring and burning were practised (Isa. v. 24, xxv.
          10, xlvii. 14; Joel ii. 5; Ob. 18), but probably neither
          extensively nor annually. Dried dung is more valuable today as
          fuel, and it was so used in the ancient time (Ezek. iv. 15). The
          usual method of renewing the strength of the soil was fallowing
          (Ex. xxiii. 11, and elsewhere). The winter crops (wheat, barley,
          lentils, etc.) were sown as soon as the early rain had softened
          the ground--from the end of October to the beginning of
          December. The sowing of the summer crops (millet, vetches, etc.)
          followed, and lasted (in the case of cucumbers) till after the
          winter harvest. Well-watered fields bear two crops. The surface
          of the soil was scratched by a very primitive plow, drawn by
          oxen or cows (Judges xiv. 18; I Kings xix. 19; Job i. 14; Amos
          vi. 12), sometimes in light soils by an ass (Deut. xxii. 10;
          Isa. xxx. 24). The furrow today is from three to four inches
          deep. The driver's goad (Judges iii. 31) served also to break
          the clods. According to the usual assumption, the field which a
          yoke of oxen (Heb. ?emedh) could plow in a day was the unit of
          land-measurement, as the present unit, the feddan (22-23 acres),
          represents a season's plowing. It is more probable, however,
          that they measured land by the amount of seed sown, as is done
          in the Talmud, and that zemedh is properly a measure of capacity
          and then designates a piece of ground of such size that it
          required a zemedh of seed. The surface was evened with an
          implement resembling a stone-boat or with a roller (Job xxxix.
          10; Isa. xxviii. 24-25; Hos. x. 11). The seed was sown by hand;
          wheat, barley, and spelt were often carefully laid in the
          furrow. In the time of the Mishnah, as at present, it was plowed
          in. At present, seed is sown rather thinly. An estimate of the
          amount of land under cultivation in ancient times is impossible.
          Large tracts in Palestine can never have been used for anything
          but pasturage; the "deserts" were extensive, as their frequent
          mention shows; and there was more wooded land than now (Josh.
          xvii. 15, 18; II Kings ii. 24). These facts make it probable
          that the extent of cultivated land did not materially exceed
          that of today.

    Harvest.

          In the Jordan valley the barley-harvest begins from the end of
          March to the first half of April; in the hill-country, on the
          coast, and in the highlands, from a week to a month later. The
          cutting of the barley opens, that of the wheat closes, the
          harvest season. Altogether it lasts about seven weeks and from
          of old it has been a time of joy and festivity (Ps. iv. 7; Isa.
          ix. 3). The Feast of the First Fruits, on which, according to
          the Priest Code, a barley-sheaf was offered (Lev. xxiii. 9-14),
          ushered in this festive time; the Feast of Weeks, seven weeks
          after the opening of the harvest, when an offering of two
          wave-loaves of the new wheat (Lev. xxiii. 17-21) was made,
          closed it. The grain was cut with a sickle (Deut. xvi. 9, xxiii.
          25; Job xxiv. 24; Jer. l. 16; Joel iii. 13). With the left hand
          the reaper grasped a bundle of ears (Isa. xvii. 5; Ps. cxxix.
          7), and with the right he cut them fairly close to the head. The
          binder followed, gathering the cut grain into his arms (Ps.
          cxxix. 7) and making it into sheaves (Gen. xxxvii. 7; Lev.
          xxiii. 10; Deut. xxiv. 19; Ruth ii. 7; Ps. cxxvi. 6), which were
          then collected in stacks (Judges xv. 5; Ruth iii. 7; Job v. 26).
          The harvesters refreshed themselves during their toil by eating
          parched corn and bread dipped in a mixture of vinegar and water
          (Ruth ii. 14). According to old custom and the law, forgotten
          sheaves and the privilege of gleaning after the reapers belonged
          to the poor (Lev. xix. 9, xxiii. 22; Deut. xxiv. 19; Ruth ii.
          2); the Priest Code provided also that the corners of the field
          were not to be wholly reaped (Lev. xix. 9, xxiii. 22). In like
          manner it was permissible to pluck ears from another's field to
          eat (Deut. xxiii. 25; Matt. xii. 1).

          The reaping was immediately followed by the thrashing. Small
          quantities of grain, and dill, cumin, and the like, were beaten
          out with a flail (Judges vi. 11; Ruth ii. 17; Isa. xxviii. 27);
          but in most cases wheat, barley, and spelt were taken to the
          thrashing-floor, which, if possible, was placed on high ground
          so that the wind might carry off the chaff. The kernels were
          trodden out by cattle or were separated by means of a rude
          thrashingsled or wagon (II Sam. xxiv. 22; Isa. xxviii. 27-28;
          Amos i. 3). Both custom and the law forbade the muzzling of an
          ox in treading out the grain (Deut. xxv. 4); and today it is
          commonly estimated that an ox will consume from three to four
          pecks of the grain daily during the thrashing-time. Winnowing
          was accomplished, with the help of the wind, by means of a
          shovel or a wooden fork having two or more tines (Isa. xxx. 24;
          Jer. xv. 7). The chaff is now used as fodder; according to Matt.
          iii. 12, it seems in ancient time to have been burned. The grain
          was sifted (Amos ix. 9) and shoveled into heaps. It was usually
          stored in cistern-like pits in the open field, carefully covered
          (Jer. xli. 8). Real barns are not mentioned till late times
          (Deut. xxviii. 8; II Chron. xxxii. 28; Jer. l. 26; Joel i.17).
          In general, Palestine may be called a fertile land, but its
          productivity has been greatly overestimated. Today the
          mountain-lands of Judea yield on an average from two- to
          threefold; the valleys of Hebron, with fertilization, from four-
          to fivefold; the very fertile Plain of Sharon, carefully
          cultivated by German colonists, eightfold for wheat and
          fifteenfold for barley. There is no reason to believe that the
          average return was greater in ancient times.

    Laws.

          Some of the laws have already been mentioned. Of greater
          importance in their effect upon agriculture were the laws aiming
          to prevent the alienation of landed property. The ancestral
          field was sacred (cf. I Kings xxi. 3). This provision explains
          the law of Lev. xxv. 25, according to which, if an impoverished
          Israelite had to sell his field, his kinsman had the first right
          of purchase (cf. Jer. xxxii. 6-12). The law also gave the
          original owner a perpetual right of redemption, and restored the
          field to him in the year of jubilee without compensation to the
          purchaser; a city house could be redeemed only within a year,
          and did not return in the year of jubilee (Lev. xxv. 27-34). The
          underlying thought here is that the land is not the private
          property of the Israelites, but belongs to God, and the
          Israelites have only the right of use. It may be questioned how
          far such laws were carried out; they are closely connected with
          the year of jubilee (see below). The same desire to preserve
          family possessions shows itself in the law of inheritance. In
          ancient time daughters did not inherit; if there were no sons,
          property passed to the nearest relative of the father, with the
          obligation to marry the widow (cf. the Book of Ruth). The Priest
          Code allows daughters to inherit when there are no sons, but
          they must marry within the family or, at least, within the tribe
          of the father (Num. xxxvi.). Still more important in its effect
          upon agriculture was the development of the Sabbath idea. It was
          an old custom and a law of the Book of the Covenant that every
          field should lie fallow one year in seven (Ex. xxiii. 10-11).
          The custom fell into disuse and Deuteronomy knows nothing of it.
          But the Priest Code revived it, imposed it upon the entire land
          at the same year (cf. Josephus, Ant., XII. ix. 5), and added the
          theoretic and impracticable yeas of jubilee (see [161]Sabbatical
          Year and Year of Jubilee). Lastly, laws arising from ideas of
          ceremonial impurity must be mentioned, such as the prohibition
          of sowing unclean seed (Lev. xi. 37-38), of plowing with an ox
          and an ass together, and of sowing different kinds of seed in
          one field (Lev. xix. 19; Deut. xxii. 9-10). Of the age of these
          customs nothing is known. The Mishnah developed and added to
          these laws with great detail.

          Scholar and adventurer; b. at Cologne, of noble family, Sept.
          14,1486; d. at Grenoble 1535. He studied at Cologne and Paris,
          and took part in some obscure enterprise in Spain (1507-08);
          lectured at the University of Dôle, in Franche-Comté, on
          Reuchlin's De verbo mirifico (1509), and aroused the opposition
          of certain monks; was sent to England on a political mission by
          the emperor (1510); returned to Cologne and lectured on
          quæstiones quodlibetales; served in the imperial army in Italy
          from 1511 to 1518, and during the same period went to the
          Council of Pisa as a theologian (1511), and lectured on
          medicine, jurisprudence, and Hermes Trismegistus in Pavia and
          Turin. He was appointed syndic at Metz in 1518, but had to flee
          from the Inquisition two years later. He entered the service of
          the Duke of Savoy, practised medicine at Freiburg (1523); became
          physician to the queen mother of France, but was expelled and
          fled to the Netherlands (1529); was appointed historiographer to
          Charles V. and lived for some years under the protection of
          Archbishop Hermann of Cologne, but finally returned to France,
          where he died. Of his two most celebrated works, the De occulta
          philosophia (written 1509-10; first printed, book i.; Antwerp,
          1531; books i.-iii., Cologne, 1533) is a compilation from the
          Neoplatonists and the Cabala and gives a plan of the world with
          an exposition of the "hidden powers" which the learning of the
          time thought it necessary to assume for the explanation of
          things; the other, De incertitudine et vanitate scientiarum et
          artium (written 1526; printed 1527), is a compilation from the
          Humanists and Reformers, and gives a skeptical criticism not
          only of all-sciences, but of life itself. A collected edition of
          Agrippa's works was published at Lyons in 1600.

   Ahab
          AHAB, ê´hab: Seventh king of Israel; son and successor of Omri.
          His dates are variously given--918-897 B.C., according to the
          older chronology; 878-857, Kamphausen; 875-853, Duncker;
          874-854, Hommel; d. about 851, Wellhausen. His history in I
          Kings xvi. 28-xxii. 40, is based upon two main sources, from
          which long extracts are given; the one, which furnished the
          account of the wars with the Arameans (ch. xx. and xxii.), may
          be described as a popular history of the kings of the northern
          realm and their wars; the other, from which the Elijah
          narratives are taken, evidently originated in prophetic circles.
          Both were of the ninth century and of Ephraimitic origin. The
          Monolith Inscription of Shalmaneser II. of Assyria (see
          [164]Assyria, VI., § 8) states that in the army defeated by
          Shalmaneser at Karkar (854 B.C.) were 10,000 men and 2,000
          chariots furnished by Akhabbu Sir'laai, by whom in all
          probability Ahab of Israel is meant (for another view, cf.
          Kittel, 233-234; Kamphausen, 43, note). The [165]Moabite Stone
          also states that the subjection of Moab to Israel, established
          by Omri, lasted for "half of his son's days." Ahab's reign was a
          time of prosperity. The long war with Judah was ended, and
          Ahab's daughter Athaliah was married to Jehoram, Jehoshaphat's
          son. A marriage alliance was also made with the Phenicians, Ahab
          taking to wife Jezebel, daughter of Ethbaal of Tyre. The
          Moabites remained subject to Israel and paid a considerable
          tribute (II Kings iii. 4). Jericho was rebuilt, and other cities
          were fortified or built. Ahab erected a palace at Jezreel
          (probably the "ivory house" of I Kings xxii. 39). In later years
          he had to fight with the Arameans of Damascus, who laid siege to
          Samaria, but were defeated and driven off. In the following year
          both armies met at Aphek in the plain of Jezreel, and Ben-hadad,
          the Syrian king, was captured and magnanimously treated by Ahab;
          with the promise to give up the conquests of his father and to
          allow Ahab's merchants to have bazaars in Damascus, he was set
          free. After three years Ahab undertook a new war against
          Damascus to capture Ramoth-gilead, which probably was to have
          been delivered to Israel after the covenant at Aphek. This time
          he had the help of Jehoshaphat of Judah, whose son may have
          married Ahab's daughter at this time. The battle was lost and
          Ahab was mortally wounded.

          Ahab's reign is of great importance in the religious development
          of Israel, and is marked by a bitter contest between the throne
          and the prophets. That Ahab had no intention of apostatizing
          from Yahweh, the god of his people, is shown by the names he
          gave his children; but to rule righteously, according to the
          conception of the prophets, did not suit his policy. He
          tolerated the calf worship instituted by Jeroboam (I Kings xii.
          26-33), and, influenced by his Phenician wife, introduced into
          Samaria the worship of the Syrian Baal (Melkarth), for whom he
          built in his capital a great temple with all the necessary
          paraphernalia. No doubt certain circles in Israel were shocked
          by this heathen worship; but the great majority saw in it no
          inconsistency with the Mosaic religion. It fell to Elijah to
          rebuke the people for "halting between two opinions"; but his
          voice, like that of other prophets who protested, had little
          effect. Jezebel tried to silence them by bloody persecutions;
          and Elijah complained that he was the only prophet of Yahweh
          left. It must not be imagined, however, that all so-called
          prophets of Yahveh had been killed; for Ahab, who still regarded
          himself as a worshiper of Yahweh, would hardly have permitted
          such an act. Those who did not oppose the worship of Baal were
          doubtless left alone; but in the eyes of Elijah they were not
          much better than the prophets of Baal. After the event on Mount
          Carmel (I Kings xviii.) Jezebel saw the futility of trying to
          suppress the opposition to the worship of Baal, and the prophets
          who had kept in hiding could come and go freely. Ahab and his
          wife were also denounced by Elijah for the crime committed
          against Naboth and his family, which led to signs of contrition
          on the king's part and to a postponement to his son's days of
          the threatened retribution (I Kings xxi.; cf. II Kings ix.
          21-26). Ahab's character and achievements are differently
          estimated. He was undoubtedly an able man, and desired to
          promote the welfare of his people; he was a brave warrior, and
          died manfully. But in the estimation of many these virtues are
          outweighed by his weakness toward Jezebel, his short-sighted
          optimism after the victory at Aphek, and his lack of deep
          religious conviction and earnestness.

   Ahasuerus
          AHASUERUS, ?-haz´yu-î´rus: A name given in the Old Testament to
          two kings. 1. The father of Darius the Mede (Dan. ix. 1). Since
          Darius is mentioned before Cyrus, he can be no other than
          Astyages, and Ahasuerus would then be Cyaxares. Phonetically the
          name is just as little connected as Cyaxares with the name which
          that king has in the Persian cuneiform inscriptions, and which
          must probably be read Huvakhshtra. It is also often found that
          the Median and Persian kings are differently named in the
          sources, a difference which is to be explained by the fact that
          after their accession to the throne they took new names. In Tob.
          xiv. 15 "Asueros" is Astyages, since he is mentioned as the
          conqueror of Nineveh beside Nebuchadnezzar.

          2. A king mentioned in the book of Esther, the Khshayarsha of
          the Persian inscriptions and the Xerxes of the Greeks, who ruled
          from 485 to 465 B.C., and was the son of Darius Hystaspes. This
          is indicated by the identity of the name and the agreement in
          character as that is given by Herodotus. With this agrees also
          the mention of Shushan (Susa) as his residence, and the
          statement in Esther i. that the kingdom extended from India, to
          Ethiopia--a statement which is confirmed by the enumeration of
          the provinces of the Persian empire in the epitaph of Darius at
          Nakshi Rustem, which, however, would not suit the time before
          Darius. With Xerxes, not with Cambyses, the Ahasuerus of Ezra
          iv. 6 is no doubt identical, to whom the Samaritans presented a
          bill of indictment against the exiles who returned to Jerusalem.

   Ahaus, Heinrich von
          AHAUS, ??´´hauz´, HEINRICH VON (Hendrik van Ahuis): Founder of
          the Brethren of the Common Life in Germany; b. in the
          principality of Ahaus, near Münster, 1370; d. in Münster 1439.
          He was descended from a noble family whose ancestors dated back
          to the ninth century, and who took their name from their
          territories on the River Aa. In 1396 he took religious orders
          and, influenced by his aunt, formerly abbess of Vreden in
          Gelderland, then a member of the Sisterhood of the Common Life
          at Deventer, affiliated himself with the followers of the new
          teaching in that town. He remained at Deventer probably till the
          year 1400, living in close association with the companions and
          successors of Groote, the founder of the fraternity, such as
          Florentius Radewyns, Brinckerink, Gerhard Zerbolt, and Thomas a
          Kempis. Having mastered the principles and the organization of
          the Brethren, and imbued with their zeal, he returned to
          Westphalia and in the year of his arrival founded a brotherhood
          at Münster. The death of his father left him with ample means
          with which he erected a house for the accommodation of the
          Brethren. Later he ceded to them his magnificent residence and
          estate at Springbrunnen, which became the seat of the general
          chapter of the fraternity. Living without vows or written
          regulations, and given up to the practise of the humble
          Christian virtues, the Brethren, nevertheless, met with
          opposition from many of the clergy and laity. The former looked
          askance at their close intermingling of the ascetic and
          spiritual with the secular life, and resented the influence
          which they speedily began to exert in the field of education,
          while the citizens of Münster regarded the activity of the
          fraternity in the production of beautiful books, which
          constituted the chief source of their livelihood, as unwelcome
          competition. The Dominicans were the most zealous of their
          opponents and at the instance of one of that order, Matthæus
          Grabow, complaint against the Brethren was lodged with the
          Council of Constance. Owing to the intercession of Gerson and
          Pierre d'Ailly, however, they obtained a complete vindication
          (1418), and the persecution served only to hasten the rapid
          spread of their influence. Ahaus was one of the representatives
          sent to Constance to defend the cause of the brotherhood.

          In 1416 Ahaus established at Cologne the second great house of
          the fraternity; and in 1428 a union was effected between the
          chapters of Cologne and Münster whereby the two houses were
          constituted practically one body. In 1441 this union was joined
          by the chapter of Wesel in Cleves, which had been founded by
          Ahaus in 1435. To the end of his life Ahaus busied himself with
          the erection of new chapters and the active supervision of the
          established houses; and, in addition to the three great chapters
          mentioned, many smaller foundations were established in the
          dioceses of Münster and Osnabrück. Communities of Sisters of the
          Common Life also were established at Emmerich, Herford,
          Hildesheim, and other places, aside from the mother house at
          Münster, with the foundation of which Ahaus was not connected.
          The labors of Ahaus exercised a beneficent influence upon the
          condition of the Church in Germany. The standard of learning
          among the clergy was raised, and monasticism was purified of
          many of its evils, while its ideals of a spiritual life received
          wide extension through the founding of secular communities. The
          Brethren were also influential in the establishment of schools,
          in the diffusion of literature both in manuscript and in printed
          form, and in the extension of the use of the vernacular for
          religious purposes.

   Ahaz
          AHAZ, ê´haz: Eleventh king of Judah, son and successor of
          Jotham. He ruled, according to the older computation, 742-727
          B.C.; according to Köhler, 739-724; according to Kamphausen,
          734-715; according to Hommel, 734-728. The most important
          political event of his reign was the subjugation of Judah to
          Assyria as a result of the Arameo- (Syro-) Ephraimitic war.
          Pekah, king of Israel, and Rezin of Damascus had conspired
          against Judah before the death of Jotham (II Kings xv. 37), but
          war was not actively carried on until after the accession of
          Ahaz. The latter could not maintain himself in the field and
          retired to the fortified Jerusalem. According to the Chronicler,
          he was defeated in pitched battle at some stage of the war.
          Rezin captured Elath on the Red Sea, which had been in
          possession of Judah since the days of Amaziah and Uzziah
          (Azariah, II Kings xiv. 7, 22), and restored it to the Edomites
          (xvi. 6, where the reading should be "Edomites" instead of
          "Syrians"), perhaps in return for help in the war (cf. II Chron.
          xxviii. 17). Judea was laid waste and partly depopulated (cf.
          Isa. i. 5-9). Ahaz in his need applied for help to
          Tiglath-pileser II. of Assyria, who forced the enemies of the
          Judean king to retire; but, as the price of this deliverance,
          Judah became an Assyrian vassal state, the king's treasure and
          the treasure of the Temple being carried to Nineveh, and a
          yearly tribute imposed. Few kings of Judah are represented as
          having so little inclination to the true Yahveh-religion as
          Ahaz. He sacrificed "on the hills, and under every green tree,"
          and set up molten images of the Baalim. In a time of great
          distress he even offered his son to Molech in the Valley of
          Hinnom; and it may be inferred from II. Kings xxiii. 11-12 that,
          under Assyrian influence, he built altars for the worship of the
          heavenly bodies in the vicinity of the Temple. The religious and
          moral deterioration of the people under Ahaz is the frequent
          theme of Isaiah's prophecy.

          (W. Lotz.)

          It is now generally held that the reign of Ahaz extended from
          735 to 719 B.C. The dates are important not merely as fixing the
          time of the accession of Hezekiah with his change of policy
          toward Assyria, but also their correlation with other events.
          Thus Ahaz is seen to have survived the fall of Samaria (722
          B.C.) and the Assyrian expedition against Ashdod (720 B.C.) with
          its consequences to Judah (cf. Isa. xx.).

   Ahaziah
          AHAZIAH, ê´´h?-z?i´??: 1. Eighth king of Israel, son and
          successor of Ahab. He reigned about two years (856-855 B.C.,
          according to Kamphausen; for other views, see the dates given
          for the close of his father's reign in the article [167]Ahab).
          Little is known of his reign. Doubtless he ended the war with
          Ben-hadad (see [168]Ahab) by treaty. After Ahab's death, the
          Moabites rebelled successfully; but Ahaziah seems to have
          undertaken no war against them. He had the misfortune to fall
          from a window and received serious injury; being a worshiper of
          Baal, he sent to Ekron to seek counsel from Baal-zebub; and his
          messengers were met on the way by Elijah, who foretold a fatal
          issue of his sickness as a punishment for sending to Baal. His
          history is found in I Kings xxii. 49-II Kings 1.

          (W. Lotz.)

          The death of Ahab and accession of Ahaziah of Israel fell in 853
          B.C. (see [169]Ahab), as is now generally agreed. Jehu acceded
          in 842 B.C., for in that year he paid homage to Shalmaneser II.
          according to the statement of the latter on his Black Obelisk.
          But Joram, who comes between Ahaziah and Jehu, reigned "twelve
          years" (II Kings iii. 1). This term seems to fill up the whole
          time between 853 and 842, inclusive. Accordingly the sickness of
          Ahaziah and active regency of Joram began just after the
          accession of the former, whose very brief reign could have had
          no significance whatever.

          J. F. M.

          2. Sixth king of Judah, son of Jehoram. He reigned one year (884
          B.C., according to the older computation; 843, according to
          Kamphausen; 842, according to Hommel). He married a daughter of
          Ahab, and it is therefore not surprising that he was a
          Baal-worshiper. His relation with the house of Omri caused his
          early death. He joined his brother-in-law, Joram of Israel, in a
          campaign against Hazael of Damascus, and the two allies attacked
          Ramoth-gilead. Joram was wounded and returned to Jezreel,
          whither Ahaziah went to visit him, and there he fell into the
          hands of Jehu, who killed him as a member of the house of Omri.
          The accounts of his death in Kings and Chronicles can not be
          reconciled. His history is found in II Kings viii. 25-ix. 29; II
          Chron. xxii. 1-9.

   Ahijah
          AHIJAH, ?-h?i´j??: A prophet, living at Shiloh, mentioned in I
          Kings xi. 29-39, xii. 15, xiv. 1-18; II Chron. ix. 29, x. 15.
          All these passages in the Book of Kings are Deuteronomic, or at
          least have been worked over by a Deuteronomic editor. In the
          latter part of Solomon's reign Ahijah seems to have enjoyed
          great authority as Yahweh's prophet. Next to Samuel and Elisha
          he is the most striking example of the fact that the prophets of
          Israel, besides promoting the religious life, meddled with
          political affairs. He gave voice to the deep dissatisfaction
          which all true Yahweh-worshipers felt in the latter part of
          Solomon's reign, and foretold to Jeroboam that he would become
          king over ten tribes. Years later, when Ahijah was an old man,
          dim of eyesight, Jeroboam sent his wife to the prophet in
          disguise to obtain help, if possible, in the severe sickness of
          his son. Again the prophet declared the misfortune to be the
          consequence of unfaithfulness to Yahweh; he foretold the death
          of the prince and the extinction of the house of Jeroboam. The
          Chronicler, according to his custom, made Ahijah also a
          historian of his time.

          (R. Kittel.)

   Ahimelech
          AHIMELECH, ??-him´e-lec: High priest at the tabernacle in Nob.
          He gave the showbread and Goliath's sword to David, not knowing
          that the latter was fleeing from Saul, and for this reason he,
          together with the entire priestly family of eighty-five persons
          (LXX, thirty-five) and the whole city of Nob, was slain by Doeg
          the Edomite at Saul's command (I Sam. xxi.-xxii.). Only his son
          Abiathar escaped and went to David. Ahimelech is called the son
          of Ahitub (I Sam. xxii. 9, 20), and was therefore great-grandson
          of Eli and a descendant of Ithamar. "Ahiah" (I Sam. xiv. 3) is
          probably another name for Ahimelech; if not, Ahiah must have
          been an older brother of the latter who officiated before him,
          or possibly the father of Ahimelech, who, in this case, should
          be called the grandson of Ahitub. Abiathar served David as
          priest during the latter's exile (I Sam. xxii. 20-23, xxiii.
          6-12, xxx. 7-8) and throughout his reign, although Zadok of
          another priestly line is always mentioned first (II Sam. xv. 24,
          xvii. 15, xix. 11, xx. 25). He was deposed by Solomon for having
          favored the succession of Adonijah (I Kings ii. 26-27, 35).

   Ahithophel
          AHITHOPHEL, ??-hith´o-fel: A counselor of David. He is called
          "the Gilonite," i.e., from Giloh, a city in the south of Judah
          (II Sam. xv. 12). David esteemed him highly for his great wisdom
          (II Sam. xvi. 23). When Absalom revolted, Ahithophel faithlessly
          betrayed David in the expectation that the rebellion would be
          successful (II Sam. xv. 12, 31, xvi. 21, xvii. 1 sqq.). He soon
          perceived, however, that his authority was not paramount with
          the young prince; and when the latter rejected his advice to
          attack David at once, he went home and hanged himself (II Sam.
          xvii. 23). Some think that Ps. xli. 9, lv. 12 sqq. have
          reference to David's sad experience with Ahithophel. Eliam, a
          son of Ahithophel, was one of David's heroes (II Sam. xxxiii.
          34); it is hardly possible that he was the Eliam mentioned as
          the father of Bath-sheba (II Sam. xi. 3).

   Ahlfeld, Johann Friedrich
          AHLFELD, ??l´feld, JOHANN FRIEDRICH: Lutheran; b. at Mehringen
          (in the Harz, near Bernburg, 25 m. n.n.w. of Halle), Anhalt,
          Nov. 1, 1810; d. at Leipsic Mar. 4,1884. His father was a
          carpenter, and he owed some of his later power to the fact that
          he was brought up with an intimate knowledge of the nature and
          needs of the mass of the people. From 1830 to 1833 he studied at
          Halle. For a year he was a private tutor, and then he taught in
          the gymnasium at Zerbst. His preaching at this time was
          influenced by rationalism. At the beginning of 1837 he was
          appointed rector of the boys' school at Wörlitz; and here he
          came under the influence of Schubring, a man of simple faith,
          and his views changed. In 1838 he became pastor of Alsleben, on
          the Saale, a village of sailors where he worked hard and
          exercised a powerful influence, finding time, however, for
          literary work, and vigorously defending the old-fashioned faith
          against rationalism. He was called to Halle in 1847 through
          Tholuck's endeavors, and did his duty nobly in the troublous
          times of the Revolution and of the cholera epidemic of 1849. He
          took positions of more and more prominence, and in 1850 was
          chosen pastor of St. Nicholas's Church in Leipsic. In 1881 he
          retired from active work.

          As a preacher Ahlfeld gained and maintained a remarkable
          popularity. Abstract speculation was not his strong point. He
          was at home in the concrete, and knew how to narrate with great
          effect stories from Holy Scripture, from the history of the
          Church, and from his own or others' experience. Besides
          preaching, he taught in the Leipsic Theological Seminary, and
          for many years did good service on the commission appointed to
          revise Luther's version of the Old Testament. He left a lasting
          memorial of his labors in more than one charitable foundation
          with whose origin he had much to do. Of the numerous collections
          of his discourses may be mentioned: Predigten über die
          evangelischen Perikopen (Halle, 1848; 12th ed., 1892); Das Leben
          im Lichte des Wortes Gottes (1861; 7th ed., 1886); Predigten
          über die epistolischen Perikopen (1867; 5th ed., 1899);
          Confirmationsreden (2 series, Leipsic, 1880).

   Aichspalt
          AICHSPALT, ?ik´sp??lt (AICHSPALTER, ASPELT): A common
          designation (from his birthplace, Aspelt, near Luxembourg) for
          Peter, archbishop of Mainz (1306-20); b. between 1240 and 1250;
          d. at Mainz June 4, 1320. He is an important figure in the
          politics and history of his time, but of less interest for
          religion or theology. Of humble origin, he was ambitious and
          adroit, and sought his advancement with skill and success. A
          knowledge of medicine helped him to win the favor of princes and
          popes. He was chancellor to Wenceslaus II., king of Bohemia
          (1296-1305), and during this time quarreled with Albert of
          Austria and thenceforth was an opponent of the house of
          Hapsburg. He promoted the election of Henry of Luxembourg as
          emperor in 1308, and under him was all-powerful in German
          affairs. He was made bishop of Basel in 1296, archbishop of
          Mainz in 1306, and proved himself efficient and praiseworthy in
          his diocese.

   Aidan, Saint
          AIDAN, ai´dan, SAINT: First bishop of Lindisfarne; d. at
          Bamborough (on the coast of Northumberland, 16 m. s.e. of
          Berwick) Aug. 31, 651. When Oswald, king of Northumbria
          (634-642), wished to introduce Christianity into his dominions
          (see [171]Oswald, Saint; [172]Celtic Church in Britain and
          Ireland), he applied to Seghine, abbot of Iona, for
          missionaries, and a certain Corman was sent, who soon returned,
          declaring it was impossible to Christianize so rude a people.
          Aidan, then a monk of Iona, suggested that Corman had failed to
          adapt his teaching to their needs and had expected too much,
          forgetting the Apostle's injunction of "milk for babes."
          Whereupon Aidan was at once ordained and sent to Oswald in
          Corman's place (635). He established himself on the island of
          Lindisfarne, near Bamborough, brought fellow workers from
          Ireland, and founded a school of twelve English boys to provide
          future priests. Consistently exemplifying in his daily life the
          doctrines he taught, he gained great influence with Oswald and,
          after his death, with Oswin, king of Deira, while the people
          were won by his mildness, humility, and benevolence. He could
          not preach in the Saxon language at first and Oswald acted as
          interpreter. His work in Northumbria was continued by
          [173]Finan. All information about Aidan comes from Bede (Hist.
          eccl., iii. 3, 5-17, 26), who praises him and tells marvelous
          stories about him.

          1892. He was graduated from Dartmouth College in 1846 and from
          Andover Theological Seminary in 1853; entered the Congregational
          ministry, and became pastor at Yarmouth, Me., 1854; became

          president of Union College 1869, professor of ethics and
          apologetics in Princeton Theological Seminary 1871; was
          transferred to the chair of Oriental and Old Testament
          literature 1882. He was a member of the Old Testament revision
          company, and translated Zöckler's commentary on Proverbs in the
          Lange series (New York, 1869).

   Ailly, Pierre D
          AILLY, PIERRE D', pyar d´??´´lyî´ (Lat. Petrus de Alliaco):
          Chancellor of the University of Paris, later bishop of Cambrai
          and cardinal, one of the distinguished churchmen who sought to
          restore unity to the divided Church during the great papal
          schism (1378-1429; see [174]Schism) by means of a general
          council; b., probably at Ailly-le-hautclocher (20 m. n.w. of
          Amiens), in the present department of Somme, 1350; d. at Avignon
          Aug. 9, 1420. He was brought up in Compiègne in the midst of the
          desolation caused by the war with England and an insurrection of
          the peasants (the Jacquerie); to this was no doubt in part due
          the strong national feeling and the prejudice against England
          which he showed later. He entered the University of Paris as a
          student of theology in the College of Navarre in 1372, and began
          to lecture on Peter Lombard in 1375. His lectures (printed as
          Quæstiones super libros sententiarum, Strasburg, 1490), gained
          for him the reputation of a clear thinker, and helped to make
          the nominalism of Occam predominant in the university. He also
          distinguished himself as a preacher.

          On Apr. 11, 1380, Ailly was made doctor of theology and
          professor. His treatise on this occasion, and other essays
          written about the same time (published as appendix to the
          Quæstiones; also in Gersonii opera, ed. Du Pin, i. 603 sqq.,
          Antwerp, 1706), show his position concerning the doctrine of the
          Church, which was brought to the front by the schism. The
          Christian Church, he said, is founded on the living Christ, not
          on the erring Peter, on the Bible, not on the canon law. The
          existing evils can be cured by a general council. Against those
          who opposed this idea of a council he wrote in 1387 a satirical
          epistle "from the devil to his prelates" (text in Tschackert,
          Appendix, pp. 15 sqq.). In 1384 he became director of the
          College of Navarre, where he had among his pupils Jean Gerson,
          who became his faithful friend. In 1389 Ailly was made
          chancellor of the university and almoner of Charles VI. of
          France, a position which brought him in close relation with the
          court at Paris. When the Avignonese pope, Clement VII., died
          (1394), Ailly's influence secured the recognition by France of
          his successor, the Spaniard Peter de Luna (Benedict XIII.). As a
          reward Benedict made Ailly bishop of Puy (1395), and two years
          later bishop of Cambrai. In 1398 Charles VI. of France and
          Wenceslaus of Germany sent him upon unsuccessful missions to
          both Boniface IX. and Benedict, to try to induce them to resign
          their office. Benedict was then kept a prisoner in Avignon by
          French troops till he escaped to Spain (1403). In 1398 and again
          in 1408 France withdrew its obedience from Benedict, without,
          however, declaring for his rival. The attempt to nationalize the
          French Church failed because the civil authorities of the time
          conducted Church affairs worse than the pope. In 1408 Ailly
          finally abandoned the cause of Benedict. The addition of a new
          element of discord by the choice of a third pope at the
          [175]Council of Pisa in June, 1409, was not in accord with
          Ailly's wishes; but in the main he stood by the council (cf. his
          Apologia concilii Pisani, in Tschackert, pp. 31 sqq.), though he
          continued to write in favor of reform by another council. John
          XXIII. (the Roman pope) sought to conciliate him by an
          appointment (June 7, 1411) as cardinal, with the title
          Cardinalis Sancti Chrysogoni, though he himself preferred to be
          called "the Cardinal of Cambrai." He attended the council called
          in Rome by John in 1412, where he interested himself in a reform
          of the calendar. In 1413 he traveled through Germany and the
          Netherlands as papal legate, and at the same time was active as
          a writer.

          Ailly's most important services in church history, however, were
          rendered at the Council of Constance (met Nov. 5, 1414; see
          [176]Constance, Council of). Here he maintained the superiority
          of a general council over the pope, but at the same time
          defended the privileges of the college of cardinals against the
          council. It was due to Gerson and Ailly that after the flight of
          John XXIII. from Constance (Mar. 20, 1415), the council was not
          adjourned. He had the courage to preside over the first popeless
          session (Mar. 26, 1415), and to carry out the order of business
          of that important gathering. The council had to decide three
          points: (1) The causa unionis (abolition of the schism); (2) the
          causa reformationis (reformation of the Church in capite et in
          membris); and (3) causa fidei (the case of John Huss). Ailly was
          very active in the last two. As president of the commission on
          faith, he examined Huss (June 7 and 8, 1415; Documenta J. Hus.,
          ed. F. Palacky, Prague, 1869, pp. 273 sqq.), and was present at
          his condemnation (July 6). He expressed his ideas on reform, as
          deputy of the college of cardinals, in the commission on reform
          and in a writing of Nov., 1416, De reformatione ecclesiæ (in H.
          von der Hardt, Magnum oecumenicum Constantiense concilium, i.,
          part viii., Frankfort, 1700). His views on the power of the
          Church he had already published (October) in his De potestate
          ecclesiæ. When, in November, the council proceeded to the choice
          of a new pope, Ailly was a candidate; but the opposition of the
          English prevented his election. He lived on good terms with his
          successful competitor, Otto di Colonna, and as his legate at
          Avignon continued influential in the French Church till his
          death. Ailly was always faithful to the interests of his
          country, although he was more churchman than Frenchman. He
          influenced the young Luther by his doubts concerning the
          doctrine of transubstantiation (cf. Luther's De captivitate
          Babylonica, Erlangen ed., var. arg., v. 29). In 1410 he wrote a
          geographical work Imago mundi (n.p., n.d.), which has interest
          as having been one of the sources from which Columbus drew his
          belief in the possibility of a western passage to India (cf.
          Tschackert, 334 sqq.).

   Ailred
          AILRED, êl´red (ÆLRED, ETHELRED): Abbot of the Cistercian abbey

          w. of Newcastle-upon-Tyne), probably in 1109; d. at Rievaulx
          Jan. 12, 1166. He spent his youth at the court of Scotland,
          entered the abbey of Rievaulx in 1131, became abbot of Revesby,
          Lincolnshire and returned to Rievaulx as abbot in 1146. He wrote
          historical and theological works, the former of which include
          lives of St. Edward the Confessor and St. Ninian, while among
          the latter are: Sermones; Speculum charitatis; De spirituali

   Aimoin
          AIMOIN, ê´´mw??n´: The name of two French monks, both known as
          historians.

          1. Aimoin of St. Germain: Teacher in the monastery school of
          Saint-Germain-des-Prés near Paris. He seems to have begun his
          literary career about 865; and to have died at the end of the
          ninth century or in the beginning of the tenth. His works, all
          of a hagiographical nature, are in MPL, cxxvi. 1009-56.

          2. Aimoin of Fleury: A disciple of [177]Abbo of Fleury, at whose
          suggestion, and therefore not later than 1004, he wrote a
          Historia Francorum, from their origin to the time of Clovis II.
          (d. 657). His life of Abbo has greater historical value; and his
          account of the translation of the relics of St. Benedict to
          Fleury contains numerous data for French history of the tenth
          century. His works are in MPL, cxxxix. 375-414, 617-870; and
          there are extracts in MGH, Script.; ix. (1851) 374-376.

          AINGER, ALFRED: Church of England; b. at London Feb. 9, 1837; d.
          there Feb. 8, 1904. He was educated at King's College, London,
          and Trinity Hall, Cambridge (B.A., 1860), and was ordered deacon
          in 1860 and priested in the following year. He was successively
          curate of Alrewas, Staffordshire, in 1860-64, assistant master
          of Sheffield College School in 1864-66, and reader at the Temple
          Church, London, in 1866-93. From 1894 until his death he was
          Master of the Temple. He was likewise made canon of Bristol in
          1887, and was elected honorary fellow of Trinity Hall in 1898,
          being also select preacher at Oxford in 1891 and 1898, as well
          as honorary chaplain to the queen in 1895-96 and chaplain in
          ordinary to the king after the latter year. In addition to a
          number of monographs on English authors, and besides
          contributions to the Dictionary of National Biography, he wrote
          Sermons Preached in the Temple Church (London, 1870). He is best
          known for his biography of Charles Lamb (London, 1882) and his
          editions of Lamb's works (1883 sqq.). His genial humor and
          whimsical temperament peculiarly fitted him to be the editor of
          Lamb, and, with his uncommon personality and exquisite literary
          taste, made him one of the most popular clergymen of London. He
          attracted to the Temple Church perhaps the most distinguished
          congregation in the city.

   Ainsworth, Henry
          AINSWORTH, HENRY: English separatist; b., probably at Swanton,
          near Norwich, 1571; d. at Amsterdam 1622 or 1623. Driven from
          England, about 1593 he went to Amsterdam, and in two or three
          years became "teacher" of the congregation of which [178]Francis
          Johnson was minister. He and Johnson could not agree and the
          congregation divided in 1610. In 1612 Johnson went to Emden, and
          thenceforth Ainsworth had the field to himself. It has been
          inferred that he lacked a university training from a statement
          of Roger Williams, that "he scarce set foot within a college
          walls" (Bloody Tenet, 1644, p. 174; cf. Dexter, 270, note 68);
          but the register of Caius College, Cambridge, shows that he was
          admitted there Dec. 15, 1587, and was in residence there as a
          scholar for four years. He was unquestionably a learned man,
          wrote excellent Latin, and had a knowledge of Hebrew (perfected
          by association with Amsterdam Jews), equaled by that of few
          other Christians of his time. He was earnest and sincere in his
          faith, conciliatory in spirit, and moderate in controversy. He
          had the chief part in drafting the Congregational Confession of
          1596 (entitled A True Confession of the Faith, and Humble
          Acknowledgment of the Allegiance which we, her Majesty's
          subjects, falsely called Brownists, do hold towards God, and
          yield to her Majesty and all other that are over us in the Lord;
          cf. Walker, pp. 41-74, where the full text is given). He wrote
          many controversial works (for full list consult DNB, i. 192-193)
          and a series of Annotations upon the books of the Pentateuch,
          the Psalms, and the Song of Songs (1612 sqq.; collected ed.,
          London, 1626-27; reprinted, 2 vols., Glasgow, 1843), which have
          still some value.

          AITKEN, WILLIAM HAY MACDOWALL HUNTER: Church of England; b. at
          Liverpool Sept. 21, 1841. He was educated at Wadham College,
          Oxford (B.A., 1865, M.A., 1867). He was presented to the curacy
          of St. Jude's, Mildmay Park, London, in 1865, and was ordained
          priest in the following year. From 1871 to 1875 he was incumbent
          of Christ Church, Liverpool, but resigned to become a mission
          preacher. The next year he founded, in memory of his father,
          Rev. Robert Aitken, the Aitken Memorial Mission Fund, of which
          he was chosen general superintendent, and which later developed
          into the Church Parochial Missionary Society. He twice visited
          the United States on mission tours, first in 1886, when the
          noonday services for business men at Trinity Church, New York,
          were begun, and again in 1895-96. Since 1900 he has been canon
          residentiary of Norwich Cathedral. Two years later he was a
          member of the Fulham Conference on auricular confession. He has
          been a member of the Victoria Institute since 1876. In theology
          he is a liberal Evangelical, but has never been closely
          identified with any party. He adheres strongly to the doctrines
          of grace, although he repudiates Calvinism. While not an
          opponent of higher criticism in itself, he exercises a prudent
          conservatism in accepting its conclusions. In his eschatology he
          is an advocate of the theory of conditional immortality. His
          writings include: Mission Sermons (3 vols., London, 1875-76);
          Newness of Life (1877); What is your Life? (1879); The School of
          Grace (1879); God's Everlasting Yea (1881); The Glory of the
          Gospel (1882); The Highway of Holiness (1883); Around the Cross
          (1884); The Revealer Revealed (1885); The Love of the Father
          (1887); Eastertide (1889); Temptation and Toil (1895); The
          Romance of Christian Work and Experience (1898); The Doctrine of
          Baptism (1900); The Divine Ordinance of Prayer (1902); and Life,
          Light, and Love: Studies on the First Epistle of St. John
          (1905).

   Aked, Charles Frederic
          AKED, CHARLES FREDERIC: English Baptist; b. at Nottingham Aug.
          27, 1864. He was educated at Midland Baptist College and
          University College, Nottingham, after having passed the early
          part of his life as an auctioneer. He was then pastor at Syston,
          Leicestershire, in 1886-88, and at St. Helens and Earlstown,
          Lancashire, in 1888-90, and from 1890 to 1906 was minister of
          Pembroke Chapel, Liverpool. In the latter year he was elected
          pastor of the Fifth Avenue Baptist Church, New York City. From
          1893 to 1906 he made yearly visits to the United States as a
          lecturer and preacher, and was also vice-president of the United
          Kingdom Alliance and one of the founders of the Passive
          Resistance League. In addition to numerous sermons and
          pamphlets, he has written Changing Creeds and Social Struggles
          (London, 1893) and Courage of the Coward, and other Sermons in
          Liverpool (1905).

   Akiba
          AKIBA, ??-kî´b??: Jewish rabbi, said to have lived in Jerusalem
          in the time of the Second Temple, and to have devoted himself to
          the study of the law when somewhat advanced in years. After the
          destruction of Jerusalem he retired to the neighborhood of Jaffa
          and also undertook extensive travels. He was executed during the
          Jewish insurrection under Hadrian (c. 133); but there is no
          proof that he was active in the revolt, or took any part in it
          except to recognize Bar-Kokba as the Messiah (in accordance with
          Num. xxiv. 17). Jewish tradition assigns as the cause of his
          death, that he taught the law when it was forbidden to do so.

          Many sayings are transmitted in Akiba's name. He defended the
          sacred character of the Song of Songs, which he interpreted
          allegorically (cf. F. Buhl, Kanon and Text, Leipsic, 1891, pp.
          28-29; E. König, Einleitung in das Alte Testament, Bonn, 1893,
          p. 450). He paid special attention to the development of the
          traditional law; a Mishnah is known under his name; and to his
          school no doubt belong the fundamental elements of the present
          Mishnah. His exegetical method found meaning even in the
          particles and letters of the law (cf. M. Mielziner, Introduction
          to the Talmud, Cincinnati, 1894, pp. 125-126, 182-185; H. L.
          Strack, Einleitung in den Thalmud, Leipsic, 1894, pp. 100-104).
          The Greek translation of the Old Testament by Aquila (said to
          have been Akiba's pupil) seems to have been influenced by such
          an exegesis (Buhl, Kanon und Text, pp. 152-155). The midrashic
          works Siphra on Leviticus, and Siphre on Deuteronomy, contain
          much material from Akiba's school.

   Alanus
          ALANUS, ?-l??´nus: Name of at least three writers of the twelfth
          century.

          1. Alanus of Auxerre: Cistercian, abbot of Larivour from 1152 or
          1153 to about 1167, bishop of Auxerre, and then for about twenty
          years monk at Clairvaux. He wrote a life of St. Bernard (in MPL,
          clxxxv.).

          2. Alanus: Abbot of Tewkesbury. He wrote a life of Thomas Becket
          (ed. J. A. Giles, in PEA, 1845; MPL, cxc.), letters (MPL, cxc.),
          and sermons.

          3. Alanus ab Insulis (Alain of Lille; often called Magister
          Alanus and Magister universalis): A native of Lille who taught
          in Paris. He was a man of wide and varied learning and combining
          philosophical studies and interests with strong adherence to the
          Church, forms an important connecting link between the earlier
          and the later scholasticism. His writings include: (1) Regulæ
          cælstis juris (called also Regulæ de sacra theologia or maximæ
          theologia). Like other sciences which have their principles, the
          supercælestis scientia is not lacking in maxims. These are here
          laid down in a series of brief sentences, partly put in
          paradoxical form with minute elucidations. The work has a strong
          leaning toward Platonism, and contains some very peculiar
          thoughts. (2) Summa quadripartita adversus huius temporis
          hæreticos, which indicates by its title the ecclesiastical
          position of the author. The first book is directed against the
          Cathari, opposes their dualism and docetism, and defends the
          sacraments of the Church. The second book denies (chap. i.) the
          right (claimed by the Waldensians) to preach without
          ecclesiastical commission; insists upon the duty of obeying
          implicitly the ecclesiastical superiors, and of making
          confession to the priest (chaps. ii.-x.); justifies indulgences
          and prayers for the dead (chaps. xi.-xiii.); and denies that
          swearing in general is prohibited and that the killing of a
          person is under all circumstances sinful (chap. xviii.). (3) De
          arte prædicandi, a homiletic work which starts with the
          definition that "preaching is plain and public instruction in
          morals and faith, aiming to give men information, and emanating
          from the way of reason and fountain of authority." It tells how
          to preach on certain subjects, as on mortal sins and the
          virtues, and how to address different classes. (4) Less
          certainly genuine are the five books De arte catholicæ fidei,
          whose style is somewhat different. The work makes the peculiar
          effort to demonstrate the ecclesiastical doctrine not only in a
          generally rational but by a strictly logical argumentation in
          modum artis. The fundamental thought is striking; but the
          execution is sometimes weak, and the definitions are so made
          that the inferences become what the author wishes to prove. (5)
          De planctu naturæ, in which Alanus gives, partly in prose,
          partly in rhyme, a picture of the darker side of the moral
          conditions of the time. (6) Anticlaudianus, a more comprehensive
          work, deriving its title from the fact that the author wished to
          show the effects of virtues as Claudian showed those of vices.
          It is a kind of philosophico-theological encyclopedia in
          tolerably correct hexameters which are not devoid of poetic
          feeling.

   Alb
          ALB: A vestment worn by Roman Catholic priests in celebrating
          mass, and prescribed also for the Church of England by the first
          prayer-book of Edward VI. ("a white albe plain, with a vestment
          or cope"). See [185]Vestments and Insignia, Ecclesiastical. The
          name was applied also to the white garments worn by the newly
          baptized in the early Church; and from this, since Easter was
          the usual time for baptism, came the name for the Sunday after
          Easter, Dominica in albis (sc. depositis).

   Alban, Saint, of Mainz
          ALBAN, SAINT, OF MAINZ: Alleged martyr of the fourth or fifth
          century, whose existence is somewhat doubtful. The oldest form
          of the story (Rabanus Maurus, Martyrologium, June 21; MPL, cx.
          1152) is that he was sent by Ambrose from Milan in the reign of
          Theodosius I. (379-395) to preach the gospel in Gaul, and was
          beheaded at Mainz on the way. Numerous details were added later.
          On the supposed site of his burial, to the South of the city, a
          church was erected in his honor, which is mentioned as early as
          758. In it in 794 Charlemagne buried his third wife, Fastrade.
          The edifice was subsequently rebuilt (796-805); and probably at
          this time it was made a Benedictine house. In 1419 it was
          changed to a knightly foundation, to which Emperor Maximilian I.
          in 1515 gave the privilege of coining golden florins (called
          "Albanusgulden"), with the effigy of the saint arrayed in
          eucharistic vestments and carrying his head in his hand--a not
          uncommon method of representing martyrs who had been beheaded,
          to indicate the manner of their death. The foundation was
          destroyed when Margrave Albert of Brandenburg ravaged Mainz in
          1552.

   Alban, Saint, of Verulam
          ALBAN, SAINT, OF VERULAM: A martyr of the Britons, often
          mistakenly called "the protomartyr of the English." Bede (Hist.
          eccl., i. 7), doubtless following some unknown acts of St.
          Alban, says that while still a pagan he gave shelter to a
          fugitive clerk during the Diocletian persecution; impressed by
          his guest's personality, he embraced Christianity, and when the
          clerk was discovered, wrapped himself in the fugitive's cloak
          and gave himself up to the authorities in his stead; he was
          scourged and condemned to death, performed miracles on the way
          to execution, and suffered on June 22; the place of his
          martyrdom was near Verulamium (St. Albans, Hertfordshire), and
          after the establishment of Christianity a magnificent church was
          erected there to his memory. Later accounts elaborate the
          narrative, and confuse the saint with others named Albanus or
          Albinus. It is said that the martyr served seven years in the
          army of Diocletian, and the name of the clerk is given as
          Amphibalus (first by Geoffrey of Monmouth), probably from his
          cloak (Lat. amphibalus). It seems certain that a tradition of
          the martyrdom of some Albanus existed at Verulamium as early as
          the visit of Germanus in 429 (Constantius's life of Germanus, i.
          25), and there is no reason to deny its truth. But that the
          martyrdom took place in the Diocletian persecution is first
          intimated by Gildas (ed. Mommsen, MGH, Chronica minora, iii. 31)
          and is probably a guess. For Aaron and Julius of Carleon-on-Usk,
          whose names are joined by Gildas with that of Alban, no local
          tradition can be shown earlier than the ninth century.

          opposition to the Bogomiles of Thracia and the Concorezenses of
          Bulgaria and Italy, an absolute dualism, by which good and evil
          were referred to two eternally opposite and equally potent

   Alber, Erasmus
          ALBER, ??l´ber, ERASMUS: Theologian and poet of the German
          Reformation; b. in the Wetterau (a district to the n.e. of
          Frankfort) about 1500; d. at Neubrandenburg (75 m. n. of Berlin)
          May 5, 1553. He studied at Mainz and Wittenberg, and was much
          influenced by Luther, Melanchthon, and Carlstadt. After teaching
          in several places, in 1527 he became pastor at Sprendlingen (15
          m. s.w. of Mainz), in the Dreieich, where for eleven years he
          worked diligently for the extension of Reformation doctrines and
          made himself known as a writer. He was an extravagant admirer of
          Luther, and possessed a very sharp tongue, which he used as
          unsparingly against Reformers who did not agree with him as
          against Roman Catholics. Erratic tendencies grew upon him with
          years, and, after leaving Sprendlingen, he moved about much and
          was at times in want. Shortly before his death he was made
          pastor and superintendent at Neubrandenburg. His writings,
          though often rude and coarse, were forceful and popular. They
          include: a rhymed version of Æsop's Fables, made at Sprendlingen
          (ed. W. Braune, Halle, 1892); Der Barfüsser Mönche Eulenspiegel
          und Alcoran (with preface by Luther, Wittenberg, 1542; Eng.
          transl., 1550), a satire directed against the Minorites, based
          upon a work of [188]Bartolomeo Albizzi; and Wider die verfluchte
          Lehre der Carlstadter, Wiedertäufer, Rottengeister,
          Sakramentlästerer, Eheschänder, Musicverächter, Bilderstürmer,
          Feyerfeinde, und Verwüster aller guten Ordnung, published three
          years after his death. Of more permanent value are his hymns
          (ed. C. W. Stromberger, Halle, 1857), of which Nun freut euch
          Gottes Kinder all is used in German hymn-books and in English
          translation (O Children of your God, rejoice).

   Alber, Matthæus
          ALBER, MATTHÆUS: The "Luther of Swabia"; b. at Reutlingen (20 m.
          s. of Stuttgart) Dec. 4, 1495; d. at Blaubeuren (30 m. s.e. of
          Stuttgart) Dec. 2, 1570. He was the son of a well-to-do
          goldsmith, took his master's degree at Tübingen in 1518, and was
          immediately called as pastor to his native city. On
          Melanchthon's recommendation he received a scholarship, enabling
          him to continue his studies for three years longer. Dissatisfied
          with the scholastic theology at Tübingen, he went to Freiburg in
          1521, but soon returned to Reutlingen, where he boldly preached
          Luther's doctrine and established the new teaching. At Easter,
          1524, he abolished the Latin mass and auricular confession. The
          same year he married, and when brought to account at Esslingen
          secured an acquittal by skilful management, although the bishop
          continued to trouble him because of his marriage till 1532. The
          Reformation made steady progress in Reutlingen; and in 1531 a
          church order with presbyterial government was introduced. During
          the Peasant's War Reutlingen was unmolested. The fugitive
          Anabaptists from Esslingen were won over by instruction and
          mildness. Zwingli endeavored to bring over Alber to his view of
          the Lord's Supper, but the latter adhered to Luther, preserving
          his independence, however, and remaining on friendly terms with
          Zwingli's friends, Blarer, Butzer, Capito, and others. In 1534
          Duke Ulrich of Württemberg called Alber as preacher to Stuttgart
          with a view of introducing the Reformation there. In 1536 Alber
          went to Wittenberg, where he preached (May 28) and assisted in
          finishing the Concordia. In 1537 at the Colloquy of Urach he
          advised cautious procedure with regard to the removal of the
          images. As he opposed the introduction of the interim in 1548,
          he was obliged to give up his office and leave the city. For a
          time he lived at Pfullingen, protected by Duke Ulrich who in
          Aug., 1549 called him as first preacher of the collegiate Church
          of Stuttgart and general superintendent. He took an active part
          in the preparation of the Württemberg Confession and the church
          order of 1553, and he attended both the latter part of the
          Second Colloquy at Worms (1557) and the Synod of Stuttgart.
          Toward the end of 1562 he was made abbot of the reformed
          monastery at Blaubeuren.

   Albert of Aix
          ALBERT OF AIX: A historian of the twelfth century, designated in
          the manuscript of his Historia expeditionis Hierosolymitanæ as
          canonicus Aquensis, but whether he was a canon of Aix in
          Provence or of Aix-la-Chapelle (Aachen) is uncertain. It is
          likely, however, since he dates events by the years of Henry
          IV., that he was a Lorrainer rather than a Provençal. He may be
          the custos Adalbertus who is mentioned for the last time in
          1192, and, in this case, he must have written his history in
          early youth. His work tells nothing of his personality, except
          that he had an ardent desire, which was never fulfilled, to
          visit the Holy Land. As a sort of compensation, he determined to
          write the events of the years 1095-1121 from the narratives of
          actual crusaders. His credibility was generally accepted until
          the middle of the nineteenth century, but since then it has been
          seriously questioned. It is probable that the work is based upon
          mere hearsay. The Historia is in MPL, clxvi., and in Recueil des

   Albert V. of Bavaria and the Counter Reformation In Bavaria
          ALBERT V. OF BAVARIA AND THE COUNTER REFORMATION IN BAVARIA:
          Albert V., duke of Bavaria (b. Feb. 29, 1528; d. Oct. 24, 1579),
          was the son of Duke William IV., whom he succeeded in 1550. The
          rulers of Bavaria had remained faithful to the Roman Catholic
          Church during the progress of the Reformation; but in spite of
          their endeavors the new ideas gained many adherents among both
          the nobility and the citizen class. Albert was educated at
          Ingolstadt under good Catholic teachers. In 1547 he married a
          daughter of Emperor Ferdinand I., the union ending the political
          rivalry between Austria and Bavaria. Albert was now free to
          devote himself to the task of establishing Catholic conformity
          in his dominions. Incapable by nature of passionate adherence to
          any religious principle, and given rather to a life of idleness
          and pleasure, he pursued the work of repression because he was
          convinced that the cause of Catholicism was inseparably
          connected with the fortunes of the house of Wittelsbach. He took
          little direct share in the affairs of government and easily lent
          himself to the plans of his advisers, among whom during the
          early part of his reign were two sincere Catholics, Georg
          Stockhammer and Wiguleus Hundt. The latter took an important
          part in the events leading up to the treaty of Passau (1552) and
          the peace of Augsburg (1555).

          The real beginning of the Counterreformation in Bavaria may be
          dated from 1557, when the Jesuits first established themselves
          in the duchy. In summoning them to Bavaria Albert and his
          advisers were actuated by the desire to use their services as
          educators in raising the mass of the clergy from their condition
          of moral and intellectual stagnation. The Jesuits speedily made
          themselves masters of the University of Ingolstadt and through
          the chancellor, Simon Thaddäus Eck, exercised a predominant
          influence at court. Eck was ably seconded by his associates, who
          obtained control of the education of the youth and of the
          clergy, and by their preaching and writings checked the spread
          of the reformed ideas among the masses of the people. Till 1563
          concession still had a part in the programme of the leaders, who
          hoped that the bestowal of communion in both kinds upon the
          laity and the abolition of celibacy in the priesthood would
          bring back many to the fold. Political events, however, led to
          an abandonment of the conciliatory policy. In 1563 Joachim,
          Count of Ortenburg, introduced the Augsburg Confession in his
          dominions, which he held as a direct fief of the empire. Albert
          discerned in this act a serious menace to the integrity of
          Bavaria, and took possession of the principality. Thenceforth
          the reformed religion, as closely connected with political
          insubordination, was made the object of a ruthless persecution.
          The opposition of the nobility was speedily overcome, and
          conformity to the teachings of the Church was enforced under
          pain of exile. By means of frequent visitations among the clergy
          and the people, the reorganization of the school system, the
          establishment of a strict censorship, and the imposition upon
          all public officials and university professors of an oath of
          conformity with the decisions of the Council of Trent, heresy
          was completely stamped out in Bavaria before 1580. The progress
          of the Counterreformation in the empire was materially helped by
          Bavaria. Albert made his territory a refuge for Catholic
          subjects of Protestant rulers and was urgent in counseling
          Emperor Maximilian II. against concessions to the Protestants.
          At his death Bavaria was the stronghold of the Catholic reaction
          in Germany, and next to Spain, the most formidable opponent of
          the Reformed faith in Europe.

   Albert of Brandenburg
          ALBERT OF BRANDENBURG: Elector of Mainz and archbishop of
          Magdeburg; b. June 28, 1490; d. at Mainz Sept. 24, 1545. He was
          the second son of Johann Cicero, elector of Brandenburg, and
          brother of the future elector, Joachim I. Through family
          influence he became canon of Mainz, at the age of eighteen. In
          1513 he was made archbishop of Magdeburg and administrator of
          Halberstadt, and in 1514, having received holy orders,
          archbishop and elector of Mainz. Having promised to pay
          personally the sum of at least 20,000 gold gulden for the
          pallium, he was forced to borrow from the Fuggers in Augsburg.
          To recoup himself, he obtained (Aug.15, 1515) from Pope Leo X.
          the privilege of preaching indulgences--ostensibly decreed for
          the building of St. Peter's in Rome--in his province for eight
          years, making a cash payment of 10,000 gulden and promising for
          the future one half of the annual revenues. He admitted that the
          transaction was a money-making affair, and when the preaching
          began commissioners representing the Fuggers accompanied the
          preachers to collect their share.

          Albert was a child of the Renaissance, interested in art, with a
          decided fondness for costly buildings, and deserves praise as a
          patron of the new literature. He admired Erasmus, protected
          Reuchlin, and drew Hutten to his court. Nevertheless, on May 17,
          1517, he issued an edict against the press and appointed the
          reactionary Jodocus Trutvetter inquisitor for his entire
          province. When the way indulgences were preached raised a storm,
          his action was characteristic. On Oct. 31, 1517, Luther sent to
          him a respectful letter on the subject, and his ninety-five
          theses. Albert put the matter aside and left the letter
          unanswered; he had no conception of Luther's motives and views,
          and desired not to be troubled. Later, when he tried to
          interfere, he found that his influence was gone. At the Diet of
          Augsburg in 1518 he was made cardinal. After the death of the
          Emperor Maximilian (1519) he worked effectively for the election
          of Charles V. As regards Luther he continued to follow the
          advice of Erasmus (in a letter of Nov. 1, 1519), to have as
          little as possible to do with him, if he cared for his own
          tranquillity. So long as his personal interests did not suffer,
          he found it easy to be tolerant. When Luther, at the wish of his
          elector, wrote a second letter (Feb. 4, 1520), Albert replied
          quite in the spirit of Erasmus. He did not interfere when Hutten
          issued his anonymous anti-Roman pamphlets, and he showed himself
          unfriendly to the mendicant friars. But when papal legates
          brought him (Oct., 1520) the Golden Rose and definite orders
          concerning Hutten and Luther, he was ready at once to expel the
          former from his court and to burn the latter's books.

          After the Diet of Worms (1521) Albert pretended to favor certain
          reforms, and many, like Carlstadt, put confidence in him.
          Luther, however, addressed to him a letter from the Wartburg
          (Dec. 1, 1521), threatening to attack publicly his "false god,"
          the indulgences, if the sale did not cease, and to expose him
          before the world. Albert yielded as a matter of policy, and
          because no other course was open to him. He was also unable to
          prevent the introduction of the Reformation into Erfurt and
          Magdeburg. He was not on good terms with his chapter in Mainz,
          and during the Peasants' War the city made a compact with the
          peasants. It was suspected that he had in mind to follow the
          example of his cousin in Prussia (see [190]Albert of Prussia)
          and to secularize his bishopric--a course which Luther openly
          (in a letter of June 2, 1525) called upon him to take. On the
          same day, however, the peasants were defeated at Königshofen,
          and the immediate danger being over, Albert made an alliance
          with Luther's most determined opponents, Joachim of Brandenburg
          and George of Saxony, for mutual protection and for the
          extermination of the Lutheran sect. For a time he continued to
          oppose the evangelical movement in a half-hearted way,
          requesting his subjects to abide by the old teaching of the
          Church. He introduced some outward changes in opposition to the
          Reformation, but without effect; his territory became smaller;
          and his influence in the kingdom grew less. The so-called
          alliance of Halle with his brother Joachim and other Catholic
          princes in 1533 could not retard the movement. His opposition in
          Dessau was in vain (1534). Even in Halle, his own city, he could
          not hinder the victory of the Reformation proved by the call of
          Justus Jonas in 1541. As early as 1536 Albert anticipated coming
          events, by removing his valuable collections of objects of art
          to Mainz and Aschaffenburg; and in 1540 he left Halle forever.
          In 1541 he urged the emperor at Regensburg to proceed against
          the Protestants with arms, if he really meant to be emperor;
          otherwise it were better if he had stayed in Spain. Albert had
          become, possibly under Jesuit influence, the most violent of the
          princely opponents of the Reformation. He met with continual
          disappointments, however, and steadily became more isolated. He
          took a deep interest in the Council of Trent, and appointed his
          legates in Apr., 1545, but did not live to see its opening. His
          last years were harassed by quarrels with his chapter and the
          importunities of his creditors, and he died, after long
          sufferings, alone, forsaken, and almost in want. The fine
          buildings which he erected at Mainz and Halle and his monument
          by Peter Vischer, in the abbey church at Aschaffenburg were the
          only memorials of his life which he left to posterity.

  1. Early Life and Conversion to Protestantism.

          Albert, margrave of Brandenburg-Ansbach, last grand master of
          the Teutonic order, first duke of Prussia, founder of the
          Prussian national Church, was born at Ansbach (25 m. s.w. of
          Nuremberg) May 17, 1490; d. at Tapiau (23 m. e. of Königsberg)
          Mar. 20, 1568. He was the third son of the Margrave Frederick
          the Elder of Brandenburg-Ansbach, received a knightly education
          at various courts, and was made a canon of the Cologne
          Cathedral. In 1508, with his brother Casimir, he took part in
          the Emperor Maximilian's campaign against Venice. He was elected
          grand master of the Teutonic order Dec. 15, 1510, was invested
          with the dignity of his office in 1511, and made his solemn
          entry into Königsberg in 1512. His efforts to make his order
          independent of Poland (to which it had owed fealty since the
          peace of Thorn, 1466) involved him in a war with the Polish
          king, which devastated the territory of the order until a truce
          for four years was made in 1521. Albert then visited Germany and
          tried in vain to obtain the help of the German princes against
          Poland. While attending the Diet of Nuremberg in 1522-23 he
          heard the sermons of Andreas Osiander (whom he afterward called
          his "father in Christ"), and associated with others of the
          reformed faith in that city. By such influence, as well as by
          the writings of Luther from the year 1520, he was won to the new
          teaching and openly avowed his convictions.

  2. Intercourse with Luther and Melanchthon and Aid to the Reformation.

          In June, 1523, he addressed a confidential letter to Luther,
          requesting his advice concerning the reformation of the Teutonic
          order and the means of bringing about a renewal of Christian
          life in its territory. In reply Luther advised him to convert
          the spiritual territory of the order into a worldly
          principality. In Sept., 1523, he visited the Reformer at
          Wittenberg, when Luther again advised him, with the concurrence
          of Melanchthon, to put aside the foolish and wrong law of the
          order, to enter himself into the estate of matrimony, and to
          convert the state of the order into a worldly one. This
          interview was the beginning of an intimate connection between
          Albert and the two Reformers of Wittenberg, and was immediately
          followed by Luther's Ermahnung an die Herren Deutschen Ordens
          falsche Keuschheit zu meiden und zu recten ehelichen Keuschheit
          zu greifen. With the advice and help of Luther, Albert provided
          pure Gospel preaching for his capital by calling thither such
          men as [192]Johann Briessmann and [193]Paulus Speratus. Johannes
          Amandus, called about the same time as Briessmann, while a
          popular and gifted preacher, proved a fanatic and agitator, and
          was obliged to leave the city and country in 1524. His place was
          taken by [194]Johannes Poliander. Authorized by Albert,
          [195]Bishop George of Polentz, who favored the Reformation, sent
          learned men to preach through the country; and evangelical
          writings, supplied by Albert's friend, Georg Vogler, chancellor
          of his brother at Ansbach, were carefully disseminated. At
          Christmas, 1523 George of Polentz openly embraced the new faith;
          and the next year, with the consent of his sovereign, he advised
          the ministers not only to preach the pure Gospel, but also to
          use the German language at the administration of baptism and the
          Lord's Supper. At the same time he recommended the reading of
          Luther's writings, and declared excommunication to be abrogated.

  3. Progress of the Reformation.

          The cause made steady progress in Königsberg. Briessmann
          delivered free lectures to the laity and ministers, aiming to
          promote a knowledge of the gospel; Speratus preached to large
          crowds; and a newly established printing-office published
          various evangelical writings, especially the sermons and
          pamphlets of Briessmann and Speratus. Abuses and unevangelical
          elements in divine service and in the inner constitution of the
          churches, images and altars serving the worship of saints, the
          multitude of masses and the sacrifice of the mass, were
          abolished. A common treasury was established for the aid of the
          poor. The reformatory movement acquired new impetus from the
          conversion of a second Prussian Prelate, Erhard of Queiss,
          bishop of Pomesania, who, under the title Themata issued a
          Reformation-programme in his diocese for the renewal of the
          spiritual life on the basis of the pure Gospel. The most
          important of all, however, was the carrying out of Luther's
          advice with regard to the transformation of the territory of the
          order into a hereditary secular duchy under the suzerainty of
          Poland, after the period of the truce had expired and peace had
          been made with Poland. On Apr. 10, 1525, the formal investiture
          of Albert as duke of Prussia took place at Cracow, after he had
          sworn the oath of allegiance to King Sigismund. Toward the end
          of the following month he made his solemn entry into Königsberg
          and received the homage of the Prussian Prelates, the knights of
          the order, and the states. On July 1, 1526, he was married in
          the castle of Königsberg to the Danish princess Dorothea, like
          himself a faithful adherent of the Gospel.

  4. Reorganization of Ecclesiastical Affairs.

          A reorganization of ecclesiastical affairs on the basis of the
          existing episcopal constitution now took place. The two bishops,
          George of Polentz and Erhard of Queiss, who were separated from
          Rome by their evangelical faith and reformatory activity,
          married. As the first evangelical bishops they confined
          themselves to purely ecclesiastical functions--ordination,
          visitation, inspection, and the celebration of marriage. The
          duke, as evangelical sovereign, felt himself obliged in publicly
          professing the Reformation and reserving the right to call a
          diet for regulating the affairs of the Church, to issue a
          mandate (July 6, 1525) requesting the ministers to preach the
          Gospel in all purity and Christian fidelity, and to testify
          against the prevailing superstition, as well as against the
          widespread godless and immoral drunkenness, lewdness, cursing,
          and frivolous swearing. The first diet to regulate the affairs
          of the Church was held in Dec., 1525, at Königsberg. The result
          was the Landesordnung, which regulated the appointment and
          support of ministers, the filling of vacancies, the observance
          of the feast-days, the appropriation of moneys received for the
          churches, for pious foundations, and for the poor. The
          Landesordnung contained also regulations for divine service,
          drawn up by the bishops and published by Albert (Mar., 1526)
          under the title Artikel der Ceremonien und andere Ordnung.

  5. His Visitation and Its Consequences.

          For the better regulation of existing evils, Albert, in
          agreement with the bishops, appointed a commission of clerical
          and lay members, to visit the different parishes, to investigate
          the life and work of the ministers, and, where necessary, to
          give them instruction and information. The result of this
          visitation, the first in Prussia, was such that in a mandate
          dated Apr. 24, 1528, Albert recommended the two bishops to
          continue such visitations in their dioceses and to impress upon
          the ministers their task with reference to doctrine and life.
          That such supervision might be permanent he ordered the
          appointment of superintendents. For the benefit of the many
          non-Germans, the ministers were supplied with translators of the
          preached word. Albert recommended Luther's Postilla as pattern
          for the preaching of the Gospel and caused a large number of
          copies to be distributed among the ministers. He also ordered
          quarterly conferences under the presidency of the
          superintendents, and in July, 1529, he authorized the bishops to
          arrange synodical meetings, at which questions pertaining to
          faith, doctrine, marriage, and other matters of importance to
          the pastoral office were considered. He induced Speratus (who
          had succeeded Queise as bishop of Pomesania) to prepare an
          outline of doctrines, which was published under the title
          Christliche statuta synodalia, and distributed among the
          ministers as the sovereign's own confession, as is indicated by
          the preface, dated Jan. 6, 1530. This precursor of the Augsburg
          Confession the bishops assigned to the ministers in 1530 as
          their canon of doctrine. It was of special importance during a
          crisis brought on by the duke. Influenced by his friend
          Friedrich von Heideck, he favored the teachings of the
          enthusiast [196]Kaspar Schwenckfeld, whom he met at Liegnitz,
          and gave appointments to his adherents. The new ordinances of
          the bishops were at first not heeded. A colloquy held at
          Rastenburg in Dec., 1531, under the presidency of Speratus
          brought about no satisfactory results. Luther's representations,
          at first unsuccessful, finally evoked the duke's prohibition of
          the secret or public preaching or teaching of the enthusiasts;
          at the same time he stated that he allowed his subjects liberty
          in matters of faith, since he would not force a belief upon the
          people. His eyes were finally opened by the Anabaptist disorders
          at Münster (see [197]Münster, Anabaptists in) and he saw the
          political danger of such fanaticism. In Aug., 1535, he issued a
          mandate to Speratus enjoining him to preserve the purity and
          unity of doctrine. He renewed his assurance to his brother,
          Margrave George, "that he and his country wished to be looked
          upon as constant members in the line of professors of the
          Augsburg Confession," and to this assurance he remained faithful
          to the end.

  6. Ordinances of 1540 and 1544.

          In 1540 Albert issued an ordinance treating of the many evils in
          the life of the people and their cure, and another concerning
          the election and support of the ministers, their widows and
          orphans, as a supplement to the Landesordnung of 1525. Assisted
          by the two bishops, he made a tour of inspection in the winter
          of 1542-43 to obtain a true insight into the religious and moral
          condition of the country. Toward the end of this tour, he issued
          (Feb., 1543) a mandate in the German and Polish languages,
          exhorting the people to make diligent use of the means of grace
          and admonishing those of the nobility who despised the word and
          the sacrament. Each house had to appoint in turn an officer to
          keep watch, from an elevated place, over the church attendance.
          Besides the Sunday pericopes the minister was to spend a
          half-hour in explaining the catechism. During the week
          devotional meetings were to be held in the houses, at which the
          people were to be examined as to their knowledge of the word of
          God. To maintain the episcopal constitution Albert, in a
          memorandum of 1542, assured the continuance of the two ancient
          bishoprics with the provision that godly and learned men should
          always be chosen for them. To promote Church life he issued an
          Ordnung vom äusserlichen Gottesdienst und Artikel der Ceremonien
          (1544), supplementing the Artikel of 1525. To improve the
          service in the churches he required the schools to train the
          children in singing, and had a hymn-book prepared by Kugelmann,
          the court band-master.

  7. Later Efforts in Behalf of the Reformation.

          Albert continued to correspond with Luther and Melanchthon, and
          many notes from his hand, remarks on the Psalms and the Pauline
          epistles, show how deeply he endeavored to penetrate into the
          Scriptures. To promote Christian culture he established a
          library in his castle, the basis of the public library founded
          by him in 1540. For the benefit of a higher evangelical
          education he established Latin high-schools, and founded at
          Königsberg a school which in 1544, with the assistance of Luther
          and Melanchthon, he converted into a university. As first rector
          he called Georg Sabinus, son-in-law of Melanchthon, but his
          character rather hampered the development of the institution. A
          still greater impediment was the appointment, in 1549, of the
          former Nuremberg reformer Andreas Osiander as first theological
          professor, his doctrine of justification calling forth
          controversies (see [198]Osiander, Andreas). After Osiander's
          death (1552), his son-in-law [199]Johann Funck gained such
          influence over the duke that he appointed none but followers of
          Osiander, whose opponents, headed by J. Morlin, were obliged to
          leave the country. The political and ecclesiastical confusion
          finally became so great that a Polish commission was forced to
          interfere, and in 1566 Funck and two of his party were executed
          as "disturbers of the peace, traitors, and promoters of the
          Osiandrian heresy." The former advisers of the duke were then
          reinstated.

          These painful experiences caused Albert to long for rest and the
          restoration of peace in Church and country. He recalled Mörlin
          and Martin Chemnitz, and, in consequence of a resolution of the
          synod, which met in 1567, to abide by the corpus doctrinæ of the
          Lutheran Church, he caused them to prepare the Corpus doctrinæ
          Pruthenicum (or Wiederholung der Summa und Inhalt der rechten
          allgemeinen christlichen Kirchenlehre-repetitio corporis
          doctrinæ christianæ) in which the Osiandrian errors were also
          refuted. This symbol, which was approved by the estates; Albert
          published with a preface, dated July 9, 1567, in which it was
          stated that "no one shall be admitted to any office in Church or
          school who does not approve of and accept it."

          After the settlement of the doctrinal questions, a revision of
          the former church-order was undertaken, the outcome of which was
          the Kirchenordnung und Ceremonien, published in 1568. The vacant
          episcopal sees of Pomesania and Samland were filled by the
          appointment of G. Venediger (Venetus) and J. Mörlin,
          respectively, after arrangements had been made with the estates
          as to the election, jurisdiction, and salary of the bishops,
          whereby the old episcopal constitution of the Prussian Church
          was established and assured. Thus, notwithstanding the trials of
          his last years, Albert saw the full development of the
          Evangelical Church in the duchy of Prussia, and quiet and peace
          restored before his death. He left a beautiful testimony of his
          evangelical faith in his testament for Albert Frederick, his son
          by his second wife, Anna of Brunswick, whom he had married in
          1550. His last words were: "Into thy hands I commit my spirit,
          thou hast redeemed me, O Lord God of Truth."

   Albert of Riga
          ALBERT OF RIGA: Founder of the German power among the Esthonians
          and Letts; d. at Riga Jan. 17, 1229. He was a nephew of Hartwig,
          archbishop of Bremen, and is first mentioned as canon in that
          city. In 1199 he was ordained bishop of Uexküll, in the
          territory of the Livonians, as the successor of Bishop Berthold
          (see [200]Berthold of Livonia) who had perished the previous
          year in an uprising of the pagan inhabitants. Though organized
          missionary work had been carried on among the Letts and the
          Livonians since 1184, they had shown themselves hostile to the
          new creed, and it fell to Albert to maintain his episcopal title
          and to spread the Gospel by the sword. Aided by a papal bull he
          succeeded in raising a large force of crusaders, and in the year
          1200 appeared on the shores of the Dwina, where he met with
          little resistance from the Livonians. In 1201 he founded the
          town of Riga, and for the protection of his dominions and the
          extension of his conquests organized the [201]Order of the
          Brothers of the Sword, whose grand master was made subordinate
          to his authority. The Christianizing of the country was promoted
          by the introduction of Cistercian and Premonstrant monks, and by
          1206 almost the entire Livonian population had been baptized. In
          1207 Albert received Livonia as a fief from the German king,
          together with the title of "Prince of the Empire." Three years
          later he was confirmed by Innocent III. as bishop of the
          territories of the Livonians and the Letts, and, without
          receiving the dignity of archbishop, was granted the right to
          nominate and ordain bishops for such territorial conquests as
          might be made from the heathen peoples to the northeast. He now
          met with formidable rivalry from the Brothers of the Sword,
          whose grand master desired to make himself independent of the
          bishop. The Danes, also, by the acquisition of Lübeck in 1215,
          became a powerful factor in the politics of the eastern Baltic.
          Though forced for a time to make concessions to both, Albert by
          courage and a wise use of circumstances, succeeded in retaining
          his power unimpaired. From 1211 to 1224 vigorous campaigns were
          carried on against the heathen Esthonians to the northeast, who
          although sided by the Russian rulers of Novgorod and Pskov, were
          compelled to submit to the German power. The Danish influence
          speedily disappeared, and the Brothers of the Sword were forced
          in time to take their lands in Esthonia as a fief from Albert
          and from his brother Hermann, whom he had made bishop of
          southern Esthonia, with his seat at Dorpat. In 1227 the island
          of Oesel, the last stronghold of the heathen resistance and the
          refuge of pirates who held the eastern Baltic in terror, was
          overrun by a crusading army, and the conversion of the country
          was completed. Albert is a striking type of the militant
          ecclesiastic of the Middle Ages. In spite of his great services
          in the spread of Christianity in the Baltic lands, it is as the
          warrior, prince, and diplomat, rather than as bishop, that he
          stands out most prominently.

          w.s.w. of Breslau), Silesia, Dec. 15, 1635; d. in Leipsic Sept.
          19, 1697. He studied in the latter city and spent most of his
          life there, being professor extraordinary of theology from 1672.
          As a representative of the orthodoxy of his time he wrote
          against [202]Pufendorf and [203]Scheffling, but is noteworthy
          chiefly for his part in the Pietistic controversy. In Feb.,
          1687, he furnished a meeting-place in his house for the collegia
          philobiblica, which brought on the controversy in Leipsic (see
          [204]Pietism). Nevertheless, in 1696 he published an
          Ausführlicher Gegenantwort auf Speners sogenannte gründliche
          Vertheidigung seiner und der Pietisten Unschuld.

   Albertini, Johann Baptist von
          ALBERTINI, ??l´´ber-tî´nî, JOHANN BAPTIST VON: Moravian bishop;
          b. at Neuwied (on the Rhine; 8 m. n.n.w. of Coblenz) Feb. 17,
          1769; d. at Bertheladorf, near Herrnhut, Dec. 6, 1831. He was
          educated at Neuwied, at Niesky (1782-85), and at the theological
          seminary of Barby (1785-88). From 1788 to 1810 he taught in the
          school at Niesky; from 1810 to 1821 he was preacher and bishop
          in Niesky, Gnadenberg, and Gnadenfrei (Silesia); in 1821 he
          became a member, and in 1824 president, of the Elders'
          Conference in the department for Church and school. He
          published: Predigten (1805); Geistliche Lieder (1821); and Reden
          (1832). Some of his spiritual songs are of rare beauty. He was a
          fellow student and friend of Schleiermacher.

   Albertus, Magnus
          ALBERTUS MAGNUS ("Albert the Great"): Founder of the most
          flourishing period of scholasticism; b. at Lauingen (26 m. n.w.
          of Augsburg), Bavaria, 1193; d. at Cologne Nov. 15, 1280. He
          studied at Padua, entered the order of St. Dominic there in
          1223, and served as lector in the various convent schools of the
          order in Germany, especially in Cologne. In 1245 he went to
          Paris to become master of theology. In 1248 he returned to
          Cologne as primarius lector and regens of the school in that
          city. In 1254 a general chapter of the Dominican order at Worms
          chose him general for Germany, in which capacity he traversed
          the country on foot from end to end, visiting the monasteries
          and enforcing discipline. In 1260 Alexander IV. made him bishop
          of Regensburg; but this office was so little in harmony with his
          character and habits as a teacher and writer that, after the
          lapse of two years, he was allowed to resign. He retired to his
          monastery in Cologne, where he spent the rest of his life,
          making many brief visits, however, to other places; as when he
          went to Paris after he had reached the age of 80 to vindicate
          the orthodoxy of his late pupil, Thomas Aquinas.

          As an author Albert evinced a many-sidedness which procured for
          him the title of doctor universalia, while his knowledge of
          natural science and its practical applications made him a
          sorcerer in popular estimation. His works fill twenty-one folio
          volumes as published by P. Jammy (Lyons, 1651; reedited by A.
          Borgnet, 38 vols., Paris, 1890-1900). They embrace logic,
          physics, metaphysics and psychology, ethics, and theology. By
          the use of translations from the Arabic and Greco-Latin
          versions, he expounded the complete philosophical system of
          Aristotle, excepting the "Politics," modifying his
          interpretation in the interests of the Church. Thus the
          influence of Aristotle came to supersede Platonism and
          Neoplatonism in the later scholasticism. At a time when
          dialectic was in sore need of a new method, the introduction of
          the Aristotelian logic provided a subtle and searching
          instrument for investigation and discussion. For Albertus, logic
          was not properly a science, but an organon for reaching the
          unknown by means of the known. Following Avicenna whom he
          regards as the leading commentator of Aristotle, he affirms that
          universals exist in three modes: (1) Before the individuals, as
          ideas or types in the divine mind (Plato). (2) In the
          individuals, as that which is common to them (Aristotle). (3)
          After the individuals, as an abstraction of thought
          (conceptualists and nominalists). Thus he seeks to harmonize the
          rival teachings concerning universals. In expounding the
          physical theories of Aristotle, he showed that he partook of the
          rising scientific spirit of the age, especially in his criticism
          of alchemy and in De vegetabilibus et plantis, which abounds in
          brilliant observations.

          The chief theological works of Albertus were a commentary (3
          vols.) on the "Sentences" of Peter Lombard, and a Summum
          theologiæ in a more didactic strain. Already the "doctrine of
          the twofold truth" had been accepted by his contemporaries--what
          is truth in philosophy may not be truth in theology, and vice
          versa. Christian thinkers were, however, profoundly perplexed by
          the sharp opposition between ideas drawn from Greek scientific
          and philosophical sources and those derived from religious
          tradition. Albertus sought to soften this antinomy by
          establishing the distinction between natural and revealed
          religion, which became henceforth a postulate of medieval and
          later theology. Since the soul can know only that which is
          grounded in its own nature, it rises to the mystery of the
          Trinity, the Incarnation, and other specifically Christian
          doctrines through supernatural illumination alone. Hence the
          well-known dictum: "Revelation is above but not contrary to
          reason." On the one hand, the attempt to "rationalize" the
          contents of revelation must be abandoned; on the other hand,
          philosophy must be modified in the interests of faith. The merit
          which belongs to faith consists in its accepting truth which
          comes only through revelation. In his entire discussion
          concerning the being and attributes of God, concerning the world
          as created in time in opposition to the eternity of matter as
          maintained by Aristotle, concerning angels, miracles, the soul,
          sin and free-will, grace, and finally, original and actual sin,
          the Aristotelian logic is applied in the most rigid manner, and
          when this fails Albertus retires behind the distinction thrown
          up between philosophy and theology. With all his learning and
          subtlety of argument, he made it evident that with his
          presuppositions and by his method a final adjudication of the
          claims of reason and faith, that is, a unity of intelligence, is
          impossible. Apart from his vast erudition, his significance lay
          first, in his profound influence upon scholastic and the
          subsequent Protestant theology through his substitution of the
          Aristotelian logic and metaphysics for Platonic and Neoplatonic
          ideas, and secondly, in the fact, that to a degree never before
          attempted, he set in clear light and organized in the thought of
          the Church the ancient opposition between Jewish supernaturalism
          and Greek rationalism. By the false antithesis thus raised
          between reason and revelation, he prepared the way for the long
          conflict of theology and science, of reason and dogma, of
          naturalism and supernaturalism, of individual judgment and
          collective authority, which is still unsettled.

   Albizzi, Antonio
          ALBIZZI, ??l-bit´sî or ??l-bît´sî, ANTONIO: Italian priest; b.
          in Florence Nov. 25, 1547; d. at Kempten (50 m. s.s.w. of
          Augsburg), Bavaria, July 17, 1626. He became secretary to
          Cardinal Andrew, archduke of Austria (1576), but after the death
          of the latter (1591) embraced Protestantism, left Italy, and
          resided thenceforth in Augsburg and Kempten. He wrote:
          Principium Christianorum stemmata (Augsburg, 1608); Sermones in
          Matthæum (1609); De principiis religionis Christianæ (1612); and
          Exercitationes theologicæ, Kempten, 1616).

   Albizzi, Bartolomeo
          ALBIZZI, BARTOLOMEO (Lat. Bartholomæus Albicius Pisanus):
          Franciscan monk; b. at Rivano, Tuscany; d. at Pisa Dec. 10,
          1401. He became a celebrated preacher, and taught theology in
          several monasteries, chiefly at Pisa. He wrote a famous book,
          Liber conformitatum vitæ Sancti Francisci cum vita Jesu Christi,
          which was approved by the general chapter of his order in 1399
          and was first printed at Venice toward the close of the
          fifteenth century. It is of great value for the history of the
          Franciscans, but is marred by exaggerations and lack of judgment
          and good taste (e.g., he states that Francis was foretold in the
          Old Testament by prototypes and prophecies, that he performed
          miracles and prophesied, and that he was crucified and is
          exalted above the angels). In subsequent editions many passages
          were modified or omitted. [206]Erasmus Alber made it the basis
          of his Barfüsser Mönche Eulenspiegel und Alcoran (published at
          Wittenberg, with an introduction by Luther, 1542). Albizzi
          published also sermons and a life of the Virgin Mary (Venice,
          1596).

   Albo, Joseph
          ALBO, JOSEPH: The last noteworthy Jewish religious philosopher
          of the Middle Ages; b. at Monreal (125 m. e.n.e. of Madrid),
          Spain, about 1380; d. about 1444. He was one of the principal
          Jewish representatives at the disputation held in 1413 and 1414
          at Tortosa, under the auspices of Benedict XIII., between
          selected champions of the Jewish and Christian religions, with
          the view of convincing the Jews, from the testimony of their own
          literature, of the truth of Christianity. About 1425, at Soria
          in Old Castile, he wrote his principal work of religious
          philosophy, Sepher ha-I??arim ("Book of the Roots," i.e.,
          "Fundamental Principles"). He finds three ideas fundamental in
          any religion, viz., God, Revelation, and Retribution. [In the
          idea of God he finds four secondary principles, unity,
          incorporeality, eternity, and perfection; in the second of his
          fundamentals he finds three secondary principles, prophecy,
          Moses as the unique prophet, and the binding force of the Mosaic
          Law; and from his third fundamental he derives secondarily the
          belief in the resurrection of the body.] He discusses also the
          distinguishing marks of the historic religions, attempting to
          prove that Judaism is differentiated from Christianity by its
          greater credibility and consonance with reason. Belief in a
          Messiah he considers an essential part not of Judaism, but of
          Christianity. There is a German translation of his work by W.
          and L. Schlesinger (Frankfort, 1844).

          ALBRECHT, OTTO WILHELM FERDINAND: German Lutheran; b. at
          Angermünde (42 m. n.e. of Berlin) Dec. 2, 1855. He was educated
          at the gymnasium in Potsdam, at the University of Halle
          (1873-77), and at the Wittenberg seminary for preachers. He was
          assistant pastor at Wittenberg in 1880-81, and pastor at Stödten
          in 1881-84, at Dachwig in 1884-92, and at Naumburg (Saale) from
          1892 to the present time. He was elected a corresponding member
          of the Königliche Akademie gemeinnütziger Wissenschaften in
          1895. His theological position is that of a modern Lutheran. His
          writings include Geschichte der Magdeburger Bibelgesellschaft
          (1892); Die evangelische Gemeinde Miltenberg und ihr erster
          Prediger (Halle, 1896); Predigten (Gotha, 1899); Geschichte der

          Enchiridion Luthers vom Jahre 1536 herausgegeben und untersucht
          (1905). He has also been a collaborator on the Weimar edition of
          the works of Luther, to which he has contributed the fifteenth
          and twenty-eighth volumes, containing the reformer's writings of
          1524 and his sermons on John in 1528-29 (Weimar, 1898-1903). He
          is likewise a collaborator on the Brunswick edition of Luther,
          and is the author of numerous briefer monographs and
          contributions.

   Albright, Jacob
          ALBRIGHT, ??l´brait, JACOB: Founder of "the Evangelical
          Association of North America;" b. near Pottstown, Penn., May 1,
          1759; d. at Mühlbach, Lebanon County, Penn., May 18, 1808. His
          parents were Pennsylvania Germans of the Lutheran Church, in
          which denomination he was himself trained. His education was
          defective, and his early surroundings were unintellectual. After
          marriage he moved to Lancaster County and carried on a
          successful tile and brick business. Grief over the death of
          several children in one year (1790) and the counsels of Anton
          Hautz, a German Reformed minister, led to his conversion, and he
          became a Methodist lay preacher. At length his concern for his
          German Lutheran brethren led him to give up business and devote
          himself entirely to missionary efforts. As the Methodist Church
          did not desire to enter upon the German field he founded a new
          denomination. Its members are often called the "Albright
          Brethren." See [208]Evangelical Association.

   Alcantara, Order of
          ALCANTARA, ??l-c??n´t?-r??, ORDER OF: A spiritual order of
          knights, with Cistercian rule, founded for the defense of the
          frontier of Castile against the Moors under Alfonso VIII., the
          Noble (1158-1214). Its name at first was Order of San Julian del
          Pereiro ("of the pear-tree"), from a Castilian frontier citadel,
          the defense of which was entrusted to two brothers, Suarez and
          Gomez Barrientos, who with Bishop Ordonius (Ordosio) of
          Salamanca (1160-66) founded the order. When Alcantara in
          Estremadura was taken by King Alfonso IX. of Leon in 1213, the
          seat of the order was transferred to that place. Alfonso
          committed the defense of this important fortress at first to the
          knightly order of [209]Calatrava, but five years later he
          transferred the service to the Order of San Julian, which now
          (1218) took the name of the Order of Alcantara, being still
          subject, however, to the grand master of the Calatrava order.
          Taking advantage of a contested election, it separated from the
          Calatrava order, and elected its first independent grand master
          in the person of Diego Sanchez. During the subsequent struggles
          with the Moors, in which the Alcantara knights distinguished
          themselves by their bravery, they had on their flag the united
          arms of Leon and Castile, with a cross of the order and the
          ancient emblem of the pear-tree. The number of their
          commanderies in their days of prosperity was about fifty. When
          Juan de Zuñiga, the thirty-eighth grand master (1479-95)
          resigned his office to become archbishop of Seville, the grand
          mastership passed to the king of Castile (Ferdinand the
          Catholic). With its independent existence the order lost more
          and more its spiritual character. In consequence of the
          disturbances in the Spanish monarchy, it was abolished in 1873,
          but was re-established in 1874 as a purely military order of
          merit by Alfonso XII.

   Alcuin
          ALCUIN, al´cwin (English name, Ealhwine; Lat. Flaccus Albinus):
          The most prominent adviser of Charlemagne in his efforts to
          promote learning; b. in Northumbria (perhaps in York) 735 (730
          ?); d. at Tours May 19, 804. He was of good birth and a relative
          of Willibrod. He was educated in the famous cathedral school of
          [211]Archbishop Egbert of York, under a master, Ethelbert
          (Albert), who seems to have been a man of many-sided learning
          and who is often praised by Alcuin. With him, or commissioned by
          him, Alcuin made several visits to Rome, and on such journeys
          became acquainted with Frankish monasteries and with men like
          Lul of Mainz and Fulrad of St. Denis. He succeeded Ethelbert as
          head of the school when the latter was made archbishop (766),
          and, after Ethelbert's retirement and the elevation of Eanbald
          to the archiepiscopal throne (778), was also custos of the
          valuable cathedral library at York. He went to Rome to obtain
          the pallium for Eanbald, and at Parma (781) met Charlemagne to
          whom he was already known. Shortly after his return to England
          he accepted a call from the Frankish king, who was then
          gathering scholars at his court, and, with the exception of a
          visit to his native land on political business in 790-793, spent
          the rest of his life on the Continent. Charlemagne gave him the
          income of several abbeys, and till 790 he acted as head of a
          court school, where not only the sons of the Frankish nobles,
          but Charlemagne and his family as well, profited by his
          instruction.

          A true scholar and teacher, Alcuin seldom meddled in worldly
          affairs, and his letters (more than 300 in number) give little
          historical information, though they are rich in personal
          details. He took an active part in the Adoptionist controversy,
          wrote two treatises against Felix of Urgel, and opposed his
          colleague, Elipandus. At the Synod of Frankfort in 794 he
          assisted in the condemnation of Felix, and later, at the Synod
          of Aachen in 799 (800?), induced him to recant (see
          [212]Adoptionism). From 793 he was the constant and efficient
          helper of Charlemagne in founding schools, promoting the
          education of the clergy, and like undertakings. He was also in
          close association with contemporaries like Arno of Salzburg,
          Angilbert, abbot of Centula, and Adalhard of Corbie. In 796 his
          patron gave him the abbey of St. Martin, near Tours, and several
          other monasteries. Under his guidance the school of Tours became
          a nursery of ecclesiastical and liberal education for the whole
          kingdom. His distinguished pupils there included Sigulf, who
          supplied the information for his biography, Rabanus Maurus, and
          perhaps the liturgist, Amalarius of Metz. When old and feeble
          and almost blind, he left the management to his scholars, but he
          continued to be the counselor of his royal friend till his
          death.

          Alcuin was mild in spirit, adverse to discord, orthodox in
          faith, equally interested in promoting the authority of Rome and
          the royal priesthood of Charlemagne. His great service was his
          part in the so-called Carolingian renaissance, his wise and
          efficient efforts to elevate and educate the clergy and the
          monks, to improve preaching, to regulate the Christian life of
          the people and advance the faith among the heathen, always by
          instruction rather then by force. His theology, while not
          original, rests on an intimate acquaintance with the Fathers,
          especially Jerome and Augustine. To ecclesiastical learning he
          added classical, but in such manner that it was always the
          servant of the former. He was able to give his master
          information concerning astronomy and natural science but, as he
          considered grammar and philosophy auxiliary to religion, so he
          regarded these branches of knowledge primarily as a means of
          knowing God.

          His theological writings include a work on the Trinity which
          contains the germs of the later scholastic theology. His
          authorship of a Libellus de processu Spiritus Sancti and of some
          other works which have been attributed to him is doubtful. He
          wrote commentaries on Genesis, the Psalms, the Song of Songs,
          John, and other books of the Bible, based upon the Church
          Fathers and following the current moral and allegorical
          exposition. At Charlemagne's request he revived the text of the
          Vulgate according to the best available sources. His skill as a
          teacher is evident in text-books on grammar and orthography, as
          well as in treatises on rhetoric and dialectics which resemble
          Cicero. His Latin poems, including epigrams, friendly letters,
          hymns, riddles, poems for special occasions, and the like, show
          more skill in versification than poetic gifts. The most
          important, the De pontificibus et sanctis ecclesiæ Eboracensis,
          gives valuable information concerning the state of culture in
          his native land and his own education [and contains (II.
          1530-61) a catalogue of the cathedral library at York, which is
          the earliest existing catalogue of an English library]. With the
          exception of the hymns, all his poems are partly in heroic and
          partly in elegiac verse. He prepared lives of Willibrod,
          Vedastus, and Richarius, which are mainly recasts and
          amplifications of older works. Of a liturgical and devotional
          character are a Liber sacramentalis and the De psalmorum usu.
          Intended more particularly for the laity are the De virtutibus
          et vitiis and a psychologico-philosophical treatise on ethics,
          De animæ ratione ad Eulaliam virginem (i.e., Guntrade, the
          sister of Adalhard).

   Aldhelm Saint
          ALDHELM (EALDHELM), ??ld´helm, SAINT: Abbot of Malmesbury and
          first bishop of Sherborne; b. probably at Brokenborough (2 m.
          n.w of Malmesbury), Wiltshire, between 639 and 645; d. at
          Doulting (7 m. s.e. of Wells), Somersetshire, May 25, 709. He
          was of royal family on both his father's and mother's side,
          studied with Maildulf (Maelduib), an Irish hermit, at Malmesbury
          (Maildulfsburg), and remained there as monk for fourteen years.
          In 670 and again in 672 he attended the school of Canterbury and
          laid the foundations of his many-sided knowledge under the
          instruction of Archbishop Theodore and his associate Hadrian. In
          675 he succeeded Maildulf as abbot at Malmesbury, and as such
          increased the possessions of the monastery, spread abroad the
          faith, and founded many stone churches, after the fashion of
          Canterbury, in place of the small wooden ones. In 705 the
          bishopric of the West Saxons was divided, Aldhelm being made
          bishop of the western part with his seat at Sherborne (in
          northwestern Dorsetshire, 18 m. n. of Dorchester). He retained
          his abbacy. He was buried at Malmesbury, but his remains were
          often translated. He was canonized in 1080.

          Aldhelm was one of the most learned men of his time, and he
          occupies a distinguished place among early British scholars. He
          represented both the Iro-Scottish and the Roman ecclesiastical
          culture, and had an acquaintance with classical authors like
          Homer and Aristotle, as well as with neo-Christian writers such
          as Prudentius and Sedulius. His works abound in Greek and Latin
          words, and his style is bombastic. Besides philology, poetry,
          music, astronomical calculations, and the like occupied him, and
          he is said to have written popular hymns. He made Malmesbury a
          rival of Canterbury as a seat of learning, and princes,
          abbesses, monks, and nuns from far and near were among his
          admirers. He is said to have visited Rome during the pontificate
          of Sergius (687-701) and to have returned with relics, books,
          and a grant of privileges for his monastery. He supported
          [215]Wilfrid of York against his enemies, and was prominent in
          urging the Britons to conform to the Roman tonsure and Easter.

          Besides briefer letters, preserved (often only in fragments) by
          Lul of Mainz, Aldhelm's works include treatises in epistolary
          form and poems, viz.: (1) an Epistola ad Acircium (King Aldfrid)
          concerning the number seven, riddles, versification, and the
          like; (2) an Epistola ad Geruntium (a Welsh prince, Geraint)
          concerning the Easter question; (3 and 4) a prose work and a
          poem in praise of virginity, addressed to the abbess and nuns of
          Barking, closing with a description of eight vices, which
          contains thrusts at Anglo-Saxon conditions. To his treatise on
          riddles he added 100 specimens dealing with nature and art,
          which are full of a feeling for nature, being herein a prototype
          of such of his countrymen as Tatwin and Boniface. In his letter
          to Geraint he holds as worthless good works without connection
          with the Roman Church. His poetry is flowery, involved, and
          alliterative. His chief merit was the extension of the faith in
          the south of England, the education of his native land, and his
          literary influence on the Continent.

   Aleandro, Girolamo
          ALEANDRO, GIROLAMO, ??´´lê-??n´drO jî-rO´l??-mO (Lat. Hieronymus
          Aleander): Italian humanist and cardinal; b. at Motta (30 m.
          n.e. of Venice) Feb. 13, 1480; d. in Rome Jan. 31, 1542. He
          studied in his native town and in Venice, settled in the latter
          city as a teacher in 1499, and became a contributor to the press
          of Aldus Manutius. In 1508 he went to Paris and there attained
          great reputation as a classical scholar, being chosen in 1513
          rector of the university. In the following year he went to Liége
          where the influence of Bishop Erard made him chancellor of the
          see of Chartres. As Erard's representative he went to Rome in
          1516 and won the favor of Cardinal Giulio de' Medici, whose
          private secretary he became. Later, Leo X. appointed him
          librarian to the Vatican. In 1520 he went as nuncio to the court
          of Emperor Charles V., charged with the task of combating the
          heretical teachings of Luther. He procured Luther's condemnation
          at the Diet of Worms in 1521, and is supposed to have been the
          author of the edict issued against the great reformer. He was
          made archbishop of Brindisi in 1524 and was sent as nuncio to
          the court of Francis I. of France, with whom he was taken
          prisoner at Pavia.

          Till 1531 Aleandro lived without employment, in Venice for the
          greater part of the time, a refugee from Rome on account of his
          debts. In 1531 he was sent as papal representative to Charles
          V., whom he accompanied to the Netherlands and Italy, zealous in
          inciting the emperor to action against the Protestants. After
          residing as nuncio in Venice from 1533 to 1535 he was summoned
          to Rome by Pope Paul III., who, in preparation for a general
          council, wished to avail himself of Aleandro's historical
          learning. His services gained him a cardinal's hat in 1538, in
          which year he went as legate to Venice where the projected
          council was to be held. Thence he was sent to the court of the
          German king Ferdinand where he at first exerted himself in favor
          of a conciliatory policy toward the Protestants, and, when his
          efforts failed, demanded their ruthless destruction. Of his
          writings the reports covering his various diplomatic missions
          are of extreme value for the history of the Reformation. His
          letters also are of importance, among his correspondents being
          Aldus Manutius, Erasmus, Ulrich von Hutten, Bembo, Contarini,
          and Cardinal Pole. His diaries are remarkable for their frank
          revelation of a life of indulgence in complete contrast with his
          priestly character.

          literary historian; b. in Brussels Jan. 22, 1592; d. in Rome
          Sept. 6, 1652. He entered the Jesuit order at Palermo in 1613,
          taught theology at Graz, and accompanied the son of Prince von
          Eggenberg, the favorite of Ferdinand II., on his travels. Then
          he returned to Graz for a time, but in 1638 was called to Rome
          as secretary for German affairs to the general of his order.
          Here he remained until his death, acting in later years as
          spiritual director of the Roman house. Of his writings the most
          noteworthy is the Bibliotheca scriptorum societatis Jesu
          (Antwerp, 1643), based upon an earlier catalogue of Jesuit
          writers by Peter Ribadeneira (1608, 1613), but much surpassing
          it in learning and thoroughness. Though betraying the Jesuit
          spirit, it shows, on the other hand, signs of an attempt at
          impartiality, proving, for example, that various books against
          the royal power, the episcopate, and the Sorbonne, the
          authorship of which the French Jesuits had tried to deny, were
          really written by them. A new and enlarged edition by an English
          Jesuit, Nathaniel Southwell, appeared at Rome in 1676. The work
          is now superseded by the Bibliothèque des Écrivains de la
          Compagnie de Jésus of Augustin and Aloys de Backer (7 vols.,
          Liége, 1853-61; new ed. by C. Sommervogel, 9 vols., Brussels,
          1890-1900).

   Alemanni
          ALEMANNI, ??´´lê-m??n´nî:

    Early History.

          An important Germanic tribe, first mentioned by Dio Cassius as
          fighting a battle with Caracalla near Mainz in 213. According to
          Asinius Quadratus, they belonged to the confederacy of the
          Suevi. They came from the northeast, where the Semnones held the
          territory between the Oder and the Elbe. They had varying
          success in their struggle against the Romans, but about 260-268
          they occupied the Tithe Lands, north of the Danube, and advanced
          south as far as Ravenna and east into what is now Early Austria.
          They fought with Maximian in 290, and obtained permanent
          possession of the territory extending to the Alb and the Neckar
          about 300. By 405 or 406 they had conquered the southern plains
          of Upper Swabia and the neighboring lands of northern and
          eastern Switzerland, as far as the Vosges. In the fifth century
          the region from the Iller to the Vosges and from the lower Main
          to the St. Gothard bore the name of Alemannia. They were a
          fierce and stubborn race, hostile to Roman civilization, and
          possessing a religion closely connected with the powers of
          nature. In the Tithe Lands they must have met with at least weak
          Christian congregations, which fell with the Roman power.

    Conversion to Christianity.

          The numerous captives who were led away from Christian Gaul had
          little influence after they were deprived of Christian nurture.
          The Alemanni, however, learned Christian views. Their prince,
          Gibuld, was an Arian, probably converted by Goths. The Augsburg
          bishopric was maintained; but the Alemanni in general continued
          heathen till they were overcome at Strasburg in 496 by Clovis,
          king of the Franks. He took their northern territory and
          established royal residences there. A part of the people went
          into the country of the Ostrogoth Theodoric, probably the
          present German Switzerland, where the bishoprics of Windisch and
          Augst (Basel) existed and the Roman population was Christian. In
          536 Vitiges ceded this territory to the Frankish king
          Theodebert. Effective missionary work was carried on by the
          newly converted Franks from St. Martin's Church at Tours as a
          center; and churches dedicated to Saints Martin, Remigius,
          Brictius, Medard, Lupus, Antholianus, Clement, Felix, and
          Adauctus indicate the Frankish influence. In the courts the
          Frankish priest ruled beside the royal administrator. As early
          as 575 the Greek Agathias hoped for a speedy victory of
          Christianity among the Alemanni, because the "more intelligent"
          of them had been won by the Franks. Duke Uncilen (588-605) was
          probably, and his successor Cunzo was certainly, a Christian.
          The oldest law of the Alemanni, the so-called pactus of c.
          590-600 recognizes the Church as the protector of slaves. The
          episcopal see of Windisch was transferred to Constance, nearer
          Ueberlingen, the ducal seat; and the Augsburg bishopric was
          separated from Aquileia, that of Strasburg coming again into
          prominence.

    Irish Missionaries.

          But heathenism was still powerful. Many of the new converts
          still sacrificed to the gods. The Frankish Church was not
          influential enough to permeate the popular life of the Alemanni.
          But efficient help came from the Celtic missionaries of Ireland.
          In 610 [216]Columban, on the suggestion of King Theodebert,
          ascended the Rhine with monks from Luxeuil and settled at
          Bregenz, but had to leave after two years. His pupil Gallus,
          however, the founder of the monastery of [217]St. Gall,
          remained, and in connection with the native priests labored for
          the cause of Christ. From Poitiers came the Celt [218]Fridolin,
          founder of the monastery of Säckingen. Trudpert built a cell in
          the Breisgau. As the Merovingians sank lower and lower the
          desire of the Alemanni for independence grew, and they found
          need of the support of the Church in their struggle for liberty.
          Unwilling to see themselves surpassed in devotion by the
          despised Franks, they made rich donations to St. Gall. The Lex
          Alemannorum, drawn up probably at a great assembly under Duke
          Lantfried in 719, gave the Church and its bishops a position of
          dignity and power, though the life of the people was still far
          from being thoroughly influenced by its moral teaching. The
          effort for independence was crushed by the strong arm of the
          mayor of the palace. To balance St. Gall, which had favored it,
          Charles Martel, with the help of [219]Pirmin, founded the
          monastery of Reichenau in 724. Pirmin was expelled in 727, and
          his pupil and successor Heddo a few years later. The entire
          people were then baptized, but they had no clear knowledge of
          the Christian faith and were still influenced by heathen
          customs. The organizing work of Boniface was at first opposed in
          Alemannia, but by 798 the people had begun to make pilgrimages
          to Rome. Several small monasteries were established, and,
          besides St. Gall and Reichenau, the royal monasteries of
          Weissenburg, Lorsch, and Fulda received rich gifts. The
          distinguished Alemanni who filled bishoprics under the
          Carolingians, and Hildegard, the queen of Charlemagne, with her
          brother, Gerold, evidence the ultimate triumph of Christianity.

   Alesius, Alexander
          ALESIUS, ?-lî´shi-us, ALEXANDER (Latinized form of Aless; known
          also as Alane): Protestant reformer; b. in Edinburgh Apr. 23,
          1500; d. in Leipsic Mar. 17, 1565. He studied at St. Andrews and
          became canon there. In 1527 he tried to induce [220]Patrick
          Hamilton to recant, attended him at the stake the next year, and
          was himself converted to the reformed doctrines. To escape from
          the harsh treatment of the provost of St. Andrews he fled to
          Germany (1532). Commended to Henry VIII. and Cranmer by
          Melanchthon, he went to England in 1535. For a short time he
          lectured on divinity at Cambridge, studied and practised
          medicine in London, and was much esteemed by the reforming party
          there till 1540, when he went back to Germany and became
          professor at Frankfort-on-the-Oder, removing three years later
          to Leipsic. He was closely associated with the German reformers,
          especially Melanchthon, and was honored and trusted by them,
          although a desire to conciliate and a belief that concord was
          possible where differences were irreconcilable made him
          sometimes appear vacillating and paradoxical. He wrote several
          exegetical works on different books of the Bible, and a large
          number of dogmatic and polemical treatises, such as De
          scripturis legendis in lingua materna (Leipsic, 1533); De
          autoritate verbi Dei (Strasburg, 1542), against Bishop Stokesley
          of London concerning the number of the sacraments; De
          justificatione contra Osiandrum (Wittenberg, 1552); Contra
          Michaelem Servetum ejusque blasphemias disputationes tres
          (Leipsic, 1554).

   Alexander
          ALEXANDER: The name of eight popes.

          Alexander I.: Bishop of Rome in the early years of the second
          century, successor of Evaristus and predecessor of Xystus I. The
          statement of the Liber pontificalis (ed. Duchesne, i.
          xci.-xcii., 54) and the Acta Alexandri (ASB, May, i. 371-375)
          that he died a martyr, with two companions, Eventius and
          Theodulus, and was buried on the Via Nomentana, is improbable.
          The excavations made on the spot designated by the Liber
          pontificalis have indeed led to the discovery of a fragment of
          an inscription concerning a martyr Alexander, but he is not
          called a bishop. The year of Alexander's consecration is
          variously given: Eusebius names 103 in his Chronicon, and 108 in
          his Historia ecclesiastica; the Catalogue Liberianus, 109. The
          year of his death is given as 114, 116, and 118. Three letters
          falsely ascribed to him are in the Pseudo-Isidore (ed.
          Hinschins, Leipsic, 1863, pp. 94-105).

          Lucca): Pope Sept. 30, 1061-Apr. 21, 1073. He was born of a
          noble family at Baggio, near Milan. When the Patarene movement
          for reform began in 1056 (see [221]Patarenes), he seems to have
          joined it. The archbishop Guido removed him by sending him on an
          embassy to the imperial court. Here he won the confidence of
          Henry III., which gained for him the bishopric of Lucca (1057).
          He was sent to Milan in 1057 and 1059 as legate in connection
          with the questions raised by the Pataria. On the death of
          Nicholas II. (1061), he was elected pope through Hildebrand's
          influence. This was in direct contravention of the imperial
          rights, confirmed by Nicholas II. himself in 1059. The empress
          Agnes, as regent, convoked an assembly of both spiritual and
          temporal notables at Basel, and Cadalus of Parma was chosen pope
          by the German and Lombard bishops. He assumed the title of
          Honorius II., and had already defeated the adherents of his
          rival in a bloody battle under the walls of Rome, when Godfrey
          of Lorraine appeared and summoned both claimants to lay the
          election before the young king Henry IV. At a synod of German
          and Italian bishops held at Augsburg in Oct., 1062, Hanno of
          Cologne, now regent, arranged that his nephew Burchard of
          Halberstadt should be sent to Rome to examine the case and make
          a preliminary decision. Burchard decided in favor of Alexander,
          who returned to Rome in the beginning of 1063, and held a synod
          at Easter, in which he excommunicated Honorius. The final
          decision of the contest was to be made at a synod of German and
          Italian bishops called for Pentecost, 1064, at Mantua. This was
          in favor of Alexander. See [222]Honorius II., antipope.

          Honorius did not abandon his pretensions until his death in
          1072, though his power was confined to his diocese of Parma.
          Even during the contest, Alexander had exercised considerable
          authority over the Western Church, and after the decision at
          Mantua he extended his claims in Germany, and put Archbishop
          Hanno of Cologne to penance for having visited Cadalus on a
          secular errand. Henry IV. himself was made to feel the papal
          power. When he desired to effect a divorce from his wife Bertha,
          Peter Damian threatened him with the severest ecclesiastical
          penalties at a diet held in Frankfort Oct., 1069. Alexander also
          came into conflict with Henry over several ecclesiastical
          appointments, of which the most important was the archbishopric
          of Milan, and when the king persisted in having his candidate
          Godfrey consecrated, though the pope had adjudged the latter
          guilty of simony, the royal counselors were excommunicated as
          having endeavored to separate their master from the unity of the
          Church. This was but the beginning of the long struggle which
          was left to the next pope, Gregory VII.

          Alexander dealt in a similarly determined manner with other
          nations. He supported the Normans, both in the north and south
          of Europe, in their career of conquest, and aided William the
          Conqueror to consolidate his newly gained power in England by
          directing his legate to appoint Normans to the episcopal sees of
          that country; the archbishopric of Canterbury was given to
          Lanfranc, abbot of Bec, under whom Alexander himself had
          received his early training. His wide claims of universal
          jurisdiction were in sharp contrast with his weakness within
          Rome itself, where the turbulent factions maintained an
          unceasing struggle against him as long as he lived. His letters
          and diplomas are in MPL, cxlvi. 1279-1430.

          Alexander III. (Roland Bandinelli): Pope 1159-81. He was born at
          Sienna and lectured in canon law at Bologna, leaving a memorial
          of this part of his career in the Summa Magistri Rolandi, a
          commentary on the Decretum of Gratian. Eugenius III. brought him
          to Rome about 1150, and made him a cardinal. In 1153 he became
          papal chancellor, and during the reign of Adrian IV. was the
          moving spirit of the antiimperial party among the cardinals, who
          advocated a close alliance with William of Sicily. His
          determined opposition to Frederick Barbarossa led to a deep
          personal enmity on the emperor's part, which was not appeased
          when Roland appeared at the Diet of Besançon in 1157 as papal
          legate, and boldly proclaimed that the emperor held his lordship
          from the pope. Adrian IV. died Sept. 1, 1159. Six days later all
          the cardinals but three (some say nine) voted for Roland as his
          successor, and he was consecrated Sept. 20. The minority chose
          the imperialist cardinal Octavian, who assumed the title of
          Victor IV. Frederick, naturally disposed toward his own
          partizan, called a council at Pavia which, as was to be
          expected, declared Octavian the lawful pope (Feb. 11, 1160), and
          two days later proclaimed Alexander an enemy of the empire and a
          schismatic. Alexander answered from Anagni on Mar. 24 by
          excommunicating the emperor and absolving his subjects from
          their allegiance; the antipope had been excommunicated a week
          after Alexander's consecration.

          Alexander had not the power to carry his hostility further. It
          is true that in Oct., 1160, at a council at Toulouse, the kings
          of England and France and the bishops of both countries declared
          for him; and Spain, Ireland, and Norway followed their lead. But
          he was unable to maintain a foothold in Italy. By the end of
          1161 he was forced to leave Rome, and in the following March
          fled across the Alps to take refuge in France. The conflict
          might have come to an end with the death of Victor IV. at Lucca
          in Apr., 1164, had not Reginald, archbishop of Cologne, the
          imperial representative in Italy, without either the emperor's
          sanction or a regard for canonical forms, set up another
          antipope, Guido, bishop of Crema, under the title of Paschal
          III. In the diet held at Würzburg at Pentecost, 1165, Reginald
          (possessed by the conception of a German national Church
          independent of every one but the emperor) talked Frederick and
          the magnates into the irrevocable step of taking an oath never
          to recognize Alexander III. or any pope chosen from his party,
          and to support Paschal III. with all their power. But on the
          whole Alexander's cause was gaining. In the autumn of 1165 he
          left France, and by Nov. 23 he was able to reenter Rome. A year
          later, Frederick crossed the Alps to unseat him, and by the
          following summer was able to take possession of St. Peter's and
          install Paschal there. Alexander fled once more, but Frederick's
          triumph was short-lived. The plague robbed him of several
          thousand soldiers and drove him from Rome; in December the
          principal Lombard cities formed a league against the oppressive
          dominion of the empire, and found a protector in Alexander, in
          whose honor they named the new city of Alessandria; finally the
          antipope died (Sept. 20, 1168). The Roman partizans of
          Frederick, without waiting for instructions, set up a new pope
          in the person of John, cardinal-bishop of Albano, under the name
          of Calixtus III. But Frederick was weary of the strife, and
          hardly five months had passed before he was negotiating with
          Alexander. Nothing resulted, however, and the emperor took up
          arms once more against the pope and the Lombard League; but the
          battle of Legnano (May 29, 1176) was so decisively against him
          that he was obliged to yield on any terms. He began fresh
          negotiations with Alexander at Anagni in October; and at Venice
          the disputed matters were discussed also with the cities, as
          well as with William II. of Sicily and the Eastern emperor, both
          of whom had joined Frederick's opponents. Peace was made Aug. 1,
          1177, the emperor acknowledging Alexander's title and abandoning
          Calixtus, who was to receive an abbey in compensation. Both
          sides agreed to restore whatever possessions they had taken from
          each other.

          A still greater triumph was won by Alexander over Henry II. of
          England. From 1163 onward the English king was involved in a
          more and more acute contest with Rome, growing out of his
          difficulties with Thomas Becket. He demanded the deposition of
          the archbishop, and, on the pope's refusal, opened negotiations
          with Frederick, and was represented at the Diet of Würzburg,
          with a view to supporting Reginald of Cologne's far-reaching
          plans. But threats of excommunication and interdict brought him
          back to an apparently peaceful attitude. The murder of Becket
          (Dec. 29, 1170) brought things to a crisis. The king was forced
          to do humiliating penance at Becket's tomb and to submit wholly
          to the papal demands. The culminating point of Alexander's
          success was marked by the Third Lateran Council (Mar., 1179).
          Besides approving the crusade against the Cathari of southern
          France, which had been inaugurated by Raymond of Toulouse with
          the support of Louis VII., the pope's friend and protector, the
          300 bishops of this brilliant assembly passed an important canon
          regulating papal elections, which confined the electoral power
          to the cardinals, excluding the lower clergy and the laity and
          making no mention of imperial confirmation, and required a
          two-thirds vote to elect.

          In spite of his apparently complete triumph over his enemies,
          Alexander never really conquered the Roman people. Soon after
          the close of the council they drove him once more into exile;
          and a month after Calixtus III. had formally renounced his
          pretensions, a new antipope was set up, who took the name of
          Innocent III. Alexander succeeded in vanquishing this rival, but
          never returned to Rome, and died at Civita Castellana Aug. 30,
          1181, his corpse being followed to its sepulcher in the Lateran
          by cries of implacable hostility from the populace. His letters
          are in MPL, cc.; his Summa was edited by F. Thaner (Innsbruck,
          1874), and his Sententiæ by A. M. Gietl (Freiburg, 1891).

          Alexander IV. (Rinaldo de Conti): Pope 1254-61. He was made a
          cardinal-deacon in 1227 by his uncle, Gregory IX., and in 1231
          cardinal-bishop of Ostia. As a cardinal, he does not seem to
          have been strongly anti-imperialistic, and Frederick II. is
          found in 1233 and 1242 writing in a tone of friendship to him.
          On the death of Innocent IV. (Dec.13, 1254), Alexander was
          elected to succeed him, and at once began to follow the policy
          of his predecessors. Conrad IV., on his death-bed, had commended
          to the guardianship of the Church his two-year-old son Conradin,
          heir to the duchy of Swabia and the kingdoms of Jerusalem and
          Sicily. Alexander accepted the charge with the most benevolent
          promises, but less than two weeks later he demanded that the
          Swabian nobles should desert Conradin for Alfonso of Castile. On
          Mar. 25, 1255, he excommunicated Manfred, Conradin's uncle, who
          had undertaken to defend the kingdom of Sicily in the child's
          name, and on Apr. 9 he concluded an alliance with Henry III. of
          England, on whose son Edmund he bestowed Sicily and Apulia, to
          be held as papal fiefs. When some of the German princes talked
          in 1254 of setting up Ottocar of Bohemia as a claimant of the
          throne in opposition to William of Holland, the papal protégé,
          he forbade them to take any steps for the election of a king in
          William's lifetime; and when William died, he forbade the
          archbishops of Cologne, Treves, and Mainz to place Conradin on
          the throne of his father. In the contest for the crown which now
          arose between Alfonso X. of Castile and Richard of Cornwall,
          brother of Henry III. of England, the pope, whose support was
          asked by both, took the side of the latter, promising him (Apr.
          30, 1259) not merely the support of his legates in Germany, but
          holding out hopes of the imperial crown. In this he was
          influenced by the English king's money, which was necessary to
          him in his contest against Manfred. In Aug., 1258, on a rumor of
          the death of Conradin, Manfred himself assumed the crown of
          Sicily, and was recognized in northern and central Italy as the
          head of the Ghibelline party. After the decisive victory of
          Montaperto had put Florence, the Guelph bulwark, in Manfred's
          power, Alexander excommunicated every one who should help him in
          any way, and laid all his dominions under an interdict (Nov. 18,
          1260). This was all he could do, since an appeal to the kings of
          England and Norway to undertake a crusade against Manfred, and a
          demand for a tenth of the income of the French clergy for the
          same purpose had both proved unsuccessful.

          Alexander had better luck against the notorious Ezzelino da
          Romano, son-in-law of Frederick II. and leader of the
          Ghibellines in northern Italy. An army raised by the pope for a
          crusade against this monster had accomplished little, but
          finally in 1259 he succumbed to a combination of princes and
          cities. In Rome, however, the party of Manfred was gaining
          strength, and in 1261 he was elected to the highest office in
          the gift of the people, that of senator. How terribly Italy
          suffered from the demoralization which followed this relentless
          warfare is evident from the spread of the Flagellants (See
          [223]Flagellation, Flagellants), whose fanatical processions
          took place even in Rome (1260). A council was called to meet at
          Viterbo for the purpose of setting on foot a crusade against the
          Tatars, but before it convened Alexander died in that city (May
          25, 1261).

          Alexander V. (Peter Philargi): Pope 1409-10. He was an orphan
          boy from Crete, brought up by the Minorites, which order he
          afterward entered. After traveling in Italy, England, and
          France, he acquired a name as a teacher of rhetoric in the
          University of Paris. Later he held a dignified position at the
          court of Ginn Galeazzo Visconti in Milan, of which see he became
          archbishop in 1402. Innocent VII. made him a cardinal. In 1408
          he was one of those who deserted Gregory XII. with a view to
          compelling an end of the schism, and in the same year he had
          invited the pope to the Council of Pisa as a representative of
          the cardinals. After both Gregory XII. and Benedict XIII. had
          been deposed, he was unanimously elected pope by the influence
          of cardinal Balthasar Cossa (July 26, 1409). Like all the other
          cardinals present, he had signed an agreement that, if he should
          be elected pope, he would continue the council until the Church
          had received a thorough reformation in head and members; but,
          once crowned as pope, he dismissed the members to their
          dioceses, there to take counsel on the points which needed
          reform.

          The schism was not ended by his election; Benedict XIII. was
          still recognized by Spain, Portugal, and Scotland; Gregory XII.,
          by Naples, Hungary, the king of the Romans, and some other
          German princes. The greater part of Germany; with England and
          France, declared for the choice of the council, as well as the
          reforming leaders Gerson and Pierre d'Ailly. Alexander was more
          concerned with the recovery of the States of the Church than
          with reform. Rome and Umbria were in the possession of Ladislaus
          of Naples, the protector of Gregory XII. Alexander
          excommunicated him, declared his crown forfeit, and transferred
          it to Louis II. of Anjou, who, with Cardinal Cossa, commanded
          the force sent against Rome. Though this expedition was
          unsuccessful, Alexander's adherents succeeded in the last few
          days of 1409 in getting the upper hand in the city. Alexander,
          however, did not return, but remained in Bologna, a pliant
          instrument in the hands of his Franciscan brethren and Balthasar
          Cossa. The friars induced him to issue a bull (Oct. 12, 1409),
          which confirmed all the extensive privileges of the mendicant
          orders in the confessional and practically crippled the
          jurisdiction of the parish priests. When he indicated his
          intention of extending this ruling to France, the University of
          Paris, with Gerson at its head, threatened to retaliate by
          excluding the friars from the platform and pulpit. Alexander
          died before this ultimatum reached Rome (May 3, 1410). By modern
          Roman Catholic historians, as the creation of the illegitimate
          council of Pisa, he is not considered strictly a lawful pope,

          Alexander VI. (Rodrigo Lanzol): Pope 1492-1503. He was born at
          Xativa, near Valencia, in 1430 or 1431 and was adopted by his
          uncle, Calixtus III., into the Borgia family and endowed with
          rich ecclesiastical benefices. In 1455 he became apostolic
          notary; in 1456, a cardinal-deacon; and in 1457, vice-chancellor
          of the Roman curia. He held also the bishoprics of Valencia,
          Porto, and Cartagena. These positions brought in vast wealth,
          which he spent in ostentatious luxury and riotous living. A
          glimpse of his life at this period is afforded by a letter of
          Pius II. (June 11, 1460), reproaching him for his participation
          in an indescribable orgy at Sienna, and rebuking him for having
          no thought but pleasure. At least seven--possibly nine--children
          were born to him as cardinal, four of whom, Giovanni, Cesare,
          Gioffrè, and Lucrezia, the offspring of his favorite mistress
          Vanozza Catanei, were the objects of his special love. On the
          death of Innocent VIII. he reached the height of his ambition by
          his election to the papacy (Aug. 11, 1492), won, it was
          generally believed, by simony and other corrupt practises.

          Alexander was unquestionably a man of great gifts, able,
          eloquent, versatile, strong in mind as in body; but all these
          gifts were defiled by the immorality of his life, which was in
          no respect different as pope from what it had been as cardinal.
          So much may be safely said, even if certain specific accusations
          made by his contemporaries, such as that of incest with his
          daughter Lucrezia, are shown to be calumnies. The remonstrances
          of secular powers like Spain and Portugal against the immorality
          of the papal court were as vain as the denunciations of
          Savonarola. The former were put off with promises; the latter's
          mouth was stopped by excommunication (May 12, 1497), when he was
          endeavoring to arouse all Italy against the papacy.

          Alexander's main aim, outside of the gratification of his
          passions, was the elevation of his children to power and wealth.
          While still a cardinal, he had obtained the Spanish duchy of
          Gandia for his eldest son, Pedro Luis, who was succeeded, on his
          early death, by Giovanni. Alexander invested the latter with the
          duchy of Benevento, together with Terracina and Preticorvo; but
          a few days later (June 14, 1497) he was mysteriously murdered.
          For a moment the pope was shocked into penitence, and talked of
          a reform of his court and even of abdication, but no lasting
          change resulted. The making of a brilliant match for Lucrezia
          was long an important factor in his policy. The first connection
          attempted was with the Sforza family. Lodovico il Moro, governor
          of Milan for his nephew Giangaleazzo, desired the sovereignty
          for himself, but was hindered by the grandfather of
          Giangaleazzo's wife, Ferdinand of Naples. To get the better of
          him, Lodovico planned a league into which the Pope should be
          drawn by a marriage between Lucrezia and Giovanni Sforza of
          Pesaro. The league was founded April 25, 1493, and included,
          besides Lodovico and Alexander, Venice, Sienna, Ferrara, and
          Mantua. Ferdinand, however, succeeded in detaching the pope from
          this alliance, probably through the influence of Spain, and
          married the natural daughter of his son Alfonso to Gioffre,
          Alexander's fourth son. The alliance with Naples, however,
          brought the pope into difficulties. Lodovico, deserted, summoned
          Charles VIII. of France to take the crown of Naples for himself
          and try a simoniacal pope at the bar of a general council.
          Charles descended into Italy in autumn, 1494, and on the last
          day of the year, Alexander being unable to oppose him, made a
          magnificent public entry into Rome. The pope agreed to allow his
          army free passage toward Naples, and to reinstate the cardinals
          of the opposition faction. In return Charles paid him all the
          outward signs of homage, and continued his journey toward
          Naples, where he was able to be crowned on May 12, Alfonso II.
          having fled. Alexander, however, joined the league founded at
          Venice (March 31) to drive him out of Italy and to support the
          house of Aragon in reconquering Naples. In return Alexander
          asked the hand of Carlotta, Princess of Naples, for his son
          Cesare, whom he had made archbishop of Valencia immediately
          after his own elevation and cardinal a year later. It was
          necessary to divorce Lucrezia from her husband Giovanni Sforza
          and marry her to a natural son of Alfonso II., the Duke of
          Bisceglia, which was accomplished in 1498. Cesare's marriage
          fell through, however; and, after resigning as cardinal, he
          married Charlotte d'Albret, sister of the King of Navarre, being
          made Duke of Valentinois by Louis XII., who received in return
          permission to divorce his wife.

          Cesare went on with designs for an extensive temporal lordship
          by fair means and foul. The ruling families of the Romagna
          having been expelled or assassinated, Alexander gave him the
          title of Duke of Romagna in 1501. The hatred of father and son
          for the house of Aragon went further. Lucrezia's second husband
          was murdered by Cesare's orders in 1500; and a year later
          Alexander joined the league of Louis XII. and Ferdinand of Spain
          for the division of the kingdom of Naples between them. The
          years 1502 and 1503 mark the height of this dominion founded on
          blood. Alexander was already thinking of asking the emperor for
          Pisa, Sienna, and Lucca for his son and making him king of
          Romagna and the Marches, when death cut short his plans, through
          an attack of malarial fever (Aug. 18, 1503).

          Of what his contemporaries thought Alexander capable may be seen
          from the story, long believed, that he was the victim of poison
          prepared by his orders for one of the cardinals whose estates he
          coveted. In recent years Alexander has been regarded by some as
          an unselfish pioneer of the unification of Italy, and attempts
          have even been made to represent him as a true follower of
          Christ; but his unworthiness is generally admitted, even by
          Roman Catholic writers.

          Alexander VII. (Fabio Chigi): Pope 1655-67. He was nuncio in
          Cologne from 1639 to 1651, and took part in the negotiations
          which led up to the peace of Westphalia, but declared that he
          would enter into no communications with heretics, and protested
          against the validity of the treaties of Münster and Osnabrück.
          Innocent X. took a similar view, and on his return from Germany
          he made Chigi cardinal and finally secretary of state. It was
          due to the influence of Chigi that Innocent condemned the famous
          five propositions alleged to have been extracted from the
          Augustinus of Jansen. Innocent died Jan. 7, 1655, and a strong
          party in the conclave favored Chigi as one who would be likely
          to be free from the reproach of nepotism; but, though Spain
          supported him, the opposition of France (Mazarin had been for
          years his personal enemy) delayed the election until Apr. 7.

          Alexander VII. had the satisfaction of seeing the daughter of
          Gustavus Adolphus, Christina of Sweden, enter the Church, though
          her prolonged residence in Rome became a burden to him later. He
          was a consistent supporter of the Jesuits, whom he succeeded in
          restoring to Venice, from which city they had been excluded
          since the conflict with Paul V. He took their side wholly in the
          struggle with the Jansenists (see [224]Jansen, Cornelius,
          Jansenism). He became embroiled with Louis XIV., first through
          the refusal of the French ambassador in Rome, the Duke of
          Créqui, to pay certain conventional civilities to the relatives
          of the pope, and then through an attack on the ambassador's
          servants and palace made by the Corsican guards of the pope.
          Louis was already displeased with Alexander for his consistent
          support of Cardinal de Retz against Mazarin, and for his
          retention, in spite of Louis's intercession in their behalf, of
          certain possessions to which the Farnese and Este families laid
          claim. In such a mood he took up the Corsican affair hotly, and
          wrote to Alexander of a breach of the law of nations, a crime
          whose parallel could hardly be found among barbarians. The papal
          nuncio was obliged to leave Paris, and French troops occupied
          Avignon and the Comtat Venaissin and threatened to invade the
          Italian states of the Church. Alexander, unable to find any
          allies, saw himself compelled to accede to the most humiliating
          demands of France in the treaty of Pisa (1664). He was obliged
          not only, by a special mission of two cardinals to Paris, to beg
          the king's pardon, but also that of the Duke de Créqui, and to
          erect a pyramid in a public place in Rome, with an inscription
          declaring the Corsicans incapable of serving the Holy See.

          Since Alexander, like his predecessor, was closely allied with
          Spain, he was obliged to carry Innocent's policy still further
          when a struggle with Portugal arose. Innocent had refused to
          recognize Portugal as an independent monarchy when in 1640 it
          broke away from Spain under the house of Braganza; and had
          declined to confirm the bishops nominated by King John IV.
          Alexander took the same course in regard to the bishops; the
          king accordingly allowed the bishoprics to remain vacant, and
          divided their estates and revenues among his courtiers, even
          thinking at one time of the extreme measure of an absolute
          breach with Rome and the establishment of a national Church,
          whose bishops should need confirmation from no one but the
          metropolitan. The conflict was finally settled by Clement IX. in
          1669.

          Much as he had had to do with affairs of state before his
          elevation to the papacy, Alexander found them wearisome, and
          left their administration as much as possible to the
          congregation of cardinals entrusted with their consideration. He
          was a cultured friend of literature and philosophy, and took
          much pleasure in his intercourse with learned men, among whom
          Pallavicini, the historian of the Council of Trent, was
          conspicuous. He tried his own hand at literature; a collection
          of his verses, under the title Philometi labores juveniles
          appeared in Paris in 1656. He died May 22, 1667.

          Alexander VIII. (Pietro Ottoboni): Pope 1689-91. He came of a
          Venetian family, was made cardinal by Innocent X., and, later,
          Bishop of Brescia and datarius apostolicus. When Innocent XI.
          died (Aug. 11, 1689), much depended on the choice of his
          successor, both for Louis XIV. and for the League of Augsburg,
          formed to oppose him. His ambassador, the Duke de Chaulnes,
          succeeded on Oct. 6 in accomplishing the election of Cardinal
          Ottoboni. Louis, whom the coalition had placed in a critical
          situation, believed that he would find the new pope more
          complaisant in some disputed points than his predecessor had
          been. He attempted to conciliate the curia by restoring Avignon,
          and abandoned the right of extraterritorial immunity which he
          had so stubbornly claimed for the palace of his ambassador in
          Rome. Alexander showed a friendly spirit, and made the Bishop of
          Beauvais a cardinal. The coalition urged the pope neither
          directly nor indirectly to approve the four articles of the
          "Gallican liberties" of 1682, on which the strife had turned
          between the king and the clergy of his party, on one side, and
          Rome, on the other. Alexander might have been willing to confirm
          the bishops whom Louis had nominated in return for their part in
          bringing about this declaration, if they would avail themselves
          of the pretext that they defended the articles only in their
          private capacity. Louis rejected this accommodation, and the
          pope condemned the declaration and dispensed the clergy from the
          oath they had taken to uphold it.

          Alexander made his name memorable in Rome by many benefits to
          the city, and showed his love for learning by the purchase for
          the Vatican library of the rich collection of Christina of
          Sweden. He is reproached, however, for yielding completely to
          the inroads of nepotism, which his predecessors had driven out.
          He died Feb. 1, 1691.

   Alexander of Hales
          ALEXANDER OF HALES (Halensis or Alensis, Halesius or Alesius;
          called Doctor Irrefragabilis and Theologorum Monarcha):
          Scholastic theologian; b. at Hales, Gloucestershire, England; d.
          in Paris Aug. 21, 1245. He was educated in the monastery at
          Hales, studied and lectured at Paris, and acquired great fame as
          a teacher in theology, and entered the order of St. Francis in
          1222. His Summa universæ theologiæ (first printed at Venice,
          1475) was undertaken at the request of Innocent IV., and
          received his approbation. It was finished by Alexander's
          scholars after his death. It is an independent work giving a
          triple series of authorities--those who say yes, those who say
          no, and then the reconciliation or judgment. The authorities are
          chosen not only from the Bible and the Fathers, but also among
          Greek, Latin, and Arabic poets and philosophers, and later
          theologians. It treats in its first part the doctrines of God
          and his attributes; in its second, those of creation and sin; in
          its third, those of redemption and atonement; and, in its fourth
          and last, those of the sacraments. Among the doctrines which
          were specially developed and, so to speak, fixed by Alexander of
          Hales, are those of the thesaurus supererogationis perfectorum,
          of the character indelibilis of baptism, confirmation,
          ordination, etc.

   Alexander of Hierapolis
          ALEXANDER OF HIERAPOLIS, h?i´´e-rap´O-lis: Bishop of Hierapolis
          and metropolitan of the province Euphratensis. He was prominent
          at the third ecumenical council (Ephesus, 431) as a fierce
          opponent of Cyril and leader of the left wing of the
          Antiochians. He persisted in his opposition even after the more
          moderate had acknowledged the orthodoxy of Cyril, and, in
          consequence, was finally deposed and banished to Famothis in
          Egypt. Suidas ascribes to him a treatise: "What Did Christ Bring
          New into the World?"

   Alexander of Lycopolis
          ALEXANDER OF LYCOPOLIS, l?i-kep´O-lis or lic´´?p´O-lis: Alleged
          author of a work against the doctrines of the Manicheans,
          written in Greek, probably about 300. He was therefore
          contemporary with the first apostles of Manicheism in Egypt.
          Photius (Contra Manichæos, i. 11) calls him bishop of Lycopolis
          (in the Thebaid), but the work (which is an important source for
          the Manichean system) does not even justify the inference that
          the writer was a Christian, and nothing is known of his life.
          The work was published by F. Combefis in his Auctarium
          novissimum, ii. (Paris, 1672) 3-21, and is reprinted in MPG,
          xviii. 409-448. It has been edited, with a good introduction, by

   Alexander Nevski, Saint
          ALEXANDER NEVSKI, SAINT: A saint of the Eastern Church; b. at
          Vladimir (110 m. e. by n. of Moscow) 1218; d. at Goroditch (360
          m. s.e. of Moscow) Nov. 14, 1263. He was the second son of Grand
          Duke Jaroslav II. of Novgorod. In 1240 he defeated the Swedes on
          the Neva, whence his title, "Nevski." Two years later he
          repelled the Livonians, who had the support of Rome. The popes
          of the time were making great efforts to bring about a union
          with the Eastern Church, and, to further their plans, they tried
          to induce Alexander and Prince Daniel of Galitch to undertake a
          crusade against the Tatars. Innocent IV. addressed letters to
          Alexander (Jan. 23 and Sept. 15, 1248), urging him strenuously
          to submit to the Roman see, to which the duke and his advisers
          replied: "We know what the Old and New Testaments say, and we
          are also acquainted with the teaching of the Church of
          Constantine and from the first to the seventh council; but your
          teaching we do not accept." Nevertheless, Innocent and his
          successor, Alexander IV., pursued their plans and appointed a
          legate for Russia, hoping that Roman bishoprics might in the
          course of time be established there. Grand Duke Alexander
          defended his Church as ably as he did his country. He won the
          favor of the Tatar khans, and in 1261 a bishopric was
          established at Sarai on the lower Volga, the residence of the
          Khan of the Golden Horde. Alexander died on one of his many
          journeys thither. He was canonized by the Church and the day of
          his burial (Nov. 23) was consecrated to him. His remains were
          transferred on Aug. 30, 1724, to the Alexander Nevski monastery
          in St. Petersburg, which had been founded by Peter the Great in
          1711 on the supposed scene of Alexander's victory over the
          Swedes in 1240.

   Alexander Severus
          ALEXANDER SEVERUS (Marcus Aurelius Alexander Severus): Roman
          emperor 222-235; b. at Arce in Phenicia, most probably 205;
          murdered by the army, probably near Mainz, at the beginning of a
          campaign against the Germans in Gaul, Mar., 235. He was a noble
          character, conscientious, almost scrupulous, meek, and well
          inclined toward all gods and men. The religious policy which he
          inherited was one of electicism and syncretism. Alexander and
          his two immediate predecessors--Caracalla, 211-217, son and
          successor of [228]Septimius Severus, and Elagabalus, 218-222,
          reputed son and successor of Caracalla--may be called the Syrian
          emperors. They were much influenced by Julia Domna, wife of
          Septimius and daughter of a priest of the sun at Emesa; Julia
          Mæsa, her sister; and the two daughters of the latter, Soæmias,
          mother of Elagabalus, and Julia Mamæa, mother of Alexander.
          About these women gathered a circle of philosophers and scholars
          who took a deep interest in religious questions. There was
          naturally here no inclination to the Roman religion and the
          claims of Christianity were, in part at least, recognized. There
          was a disposition to attempt to revive heathenism by importing
          the good in the new religion. [229]Elagabalus had sought to
          unite the religions of the empire, but in fantastic manner,
          aiming to make all gods subordinate to the sun-god of Emesa,
          whose priest he was. Alexander continued his syncretism in
          nobler fashion. He was susceptible to all good and had respect
          for all religions. The image of Christ stood in his lararium
          with those of Orpheus, Abraham, and Apollonius of Tyana, and he
          is said to have wished to erect in Rome a temple to Jesus. The
          Christian ethics also attracted him, he often quoted the precept
          "what ye will not that others do to you, that do not ye to them"
          and had it inscribed on public buildings. Mamæa was even more
          favorable to Christianity; Eusebius (Hist. eccl., vi. 21) calls
          her "a most pious woman, if there ever was one, and of religious
          life," but the assertion that she was a Christian (first made by
          Orosius, vii. 18) is unfounded.

          That the Church had peace under Alexander, as under his
          predecessors, was the natural consequence of his training and
          his character. Lampridius says expressly that Alexander
          "suffered the Christians to exist," and Firmilian, bishop of
          Cæsarea in Cappadocia, in a letter to Cyprian (Epist., lxxv.
          [lxxiv.]), written about 256, speaks of "the long peace." To be
          sure, individuals may have been brought to trial here and there,
          but the later accounts which make Alexander a cruel persecutor
          under whom thousands of Christians suffered death are false, and
          the reputed martyrdoms under him, as of the Roman bishops
          Callistus and Urbanus and of St. Cecilia, are unhistoric.

   Alexander, Archibald
          ALEXANDER, ARCHIBALD: Presbyterian clergyman, and first
          professor in the Princeton Theological Seminary; b. about 7 m.
          e. of Lexington, in Augusta (later Rockbridge) County, Virginia,
          Apr. 17, 1772; d. at Princeton Oct. 22, 1851. He received as
          good schooling as the place and time afforded, including
          attendance from the age of ten at the Liberty Hall Academy of
          the Rev. William Graham, near Lexington. He was converted in the
          great revival of 1789, studied theology with Mr. Graham, was
          licensed in 1791 and ordained in 1794, and became president of
          Hampden Sydney College 1796, and pastor of the Third
          Presbyterian Church (Pine Street), Philadelphia, 1806. In 1812
          he was entrusted by the General Assembly with the organization
          of the Princeton Theological Seminary. For the first year he
          taught all departments, but as other professors were added he
          confined himself to pastoral and polemic theology. His chief
          books were: A Brief Outline of the Evidences of the Christian
          Religion (Princeton, 1825); The Canon of the Old and New
          Testaments Ascertained (1826); A Pocket Dictionary of the Bible
          (Philadelphia, 1829); Biographical Sketches of the Founder and
          Principal Alumni of the Log College (Princeton, 1845); and
          Outlines of Moral Science (New York, 1852).

   Alexander, Charles McCallon
          ALEXANDER, CHARLES McCALLON: Revivalist; b. at Meadow, Tenn.,
          Oct. 24, 1867. He was educated at Maryville College, Maryville,
          Tenn., but left in 1887 without taking a degree, and, after
          being musical director for a time in the same institution,
          prepared himself for evangelistic work at the Moody Bible
          Institute, Chicago, having already been singing associate of the
          Quaker evangelist John Kittrell for three months. During a part
          of the period of study in the Moody Bible Institute he was
          choirmaster of the Moody Sunday-school, and in 1893 was
          associated with Dwight L. Moody in the revival services
          connected with the World's Fair at Chicago. From 1894 to 1901 he
          was singing associate of the revivalist Milan B. Williams,
          working in Iowa for the first five years and in other parts of
          the United States during the remainder of the time. At the
          conclusion of this period Mr. Williams went for a short visit to
          Palestine, and in the interval Alexander was asked by Rev. Dr.
          R. A. Torrey to accompany him to Australia. They began their
          work in 1902, and for six months traveled throughout Australia,
          Tasmania, and New Zealand, after which they conducted a revival
          for six weeks in Madura, Madras, Calcutta, Bombay, and Benares.
          They then went to England, where they remained from 1902 to
          1904, and in 1905-06 conducted successful revival services in
          Canada and the United States. In regard to the Bible Mr.
          Alexander takes the most conservative position, for he declares
          that he "believes in the absolute reliability of every
          statement" in it. He has issued Revival Songs (Melbourne, 1901);
          Revival Hymns (London, 1903); and Revival Hymns (another
          collection; Chicago, 1906).

          known of his writings were the Plain Words to a Young
          Communicant (New York, 1854) and Thoughts on Preaching (1864).
          Some of his translations of German hymns (such as Gerhardt's O

   Alexandria, Patriarchate of
          ALEXANDRIA, PATRIARCHATE OF: One of the most important episcopal
          sees of the early Church, traditionally believed to have been
          founded by the evangelist Mark. It originally had metropolitan
          jurisdiction over the whole of Egypt, and gradually became
          recognized as holding an even wider or patriarchal authority,
          next to that of Rome, until Constantinople took second place in
          the fourth century. For its early history in this connection,
          see [232]Patriarch. The rise of heresies and divisions in the
          Church, so zealously combated by famous incumbents of this see,
          such as Athanasius and Cyril, led to schisms. The Monophysites
          contested the see with the orthodox or occupied it through a
          large part of the fifth and sixth centuries, and from the
          seventh century the Melchites and Copts continued the same
          conflict. The Coptic patriarchs maintained close relations with
          the Jacobite patriarchs of Antioch, and enjoyed the larger share
          of the favor of the Mohammedan rulers. In the fourteenth
          century, however, they as well as their Melchite rivals were
          subjected to severe persecutions. When the city was conquered by
          the crusaders in 1365, the Melchite patriarch was living in
          Constantinople under the protection of the patriarch of that
          see, whose influence continually increased in Alexandria, until
          the Alexandrian patriarchs came to be regularly chosen either
          from the clergy of Constantinople or from Alexandrian clergy
          resident there.

          The seat of the patriarchate was for a long while in Old Cairo,
          but in modern times the incumbent has usually resided in
          Constantinople. Since 1672 he has had only four metropolitans
          under him; namely, those of Ethiopia (purely titular), Cairo
          (the former Memphis), Damietta (transferred from Pelusium), and
          Rosetta. The Coptic see was transferred to Old Cairo still
          earlier, under Christodoulos (1045-76), and claims jurisdiction
          over thirteen bishoprics. See [233]Coptic Church; [234]Egypt.

          The term "School of Alexandria" is used in two different senses:
          (1) The catechetical school was an institution which grew up not
          later than the last half of the second century, and lasted to
          the end of the fourth, with a regular succession of teachers
          like the schools of philosophy. (2) By the same name is also
          understood a group of theologians of the fourth and fifth
          centuries, the most important of whom was Cyril of Alexandria.
          They were in general opposition to the [235]school of Antioch,
          and were the progenitors of Monophysitism and of the
          anti-Nestorian interpretation of the decrees of Chalcedon, thus
          originating in the order of intellectual development the
          decisions of the third and fifth councils. It will be convenient
          to treat both meanings of the term together.

  1. Origin.

          Nothing certain is known of the origin of Christianity in
          Alexandria, but it is noteworthy that tradition refers the first
          preaching of the Gospel there and the foundation of a group of
          ascetic philosophers to one and the same period, and practically
          to the same man, Mark the Evangelist--which indicates that the
          school dates from the earliest days of Alexandrian Christianity.
          At the end of the second century, it emerges into light as an
          established institution under the teacher Pantænus, thus
          confirming the observation, generally true, that Christianity
          adapted itself everywhere to local characteristics. The oldest
          Gnostic schools are met with in Egypt, and the oldest school
          found in direct relation to the Church (Justin, Tatian, and
          others had what might be called private schools) is that of
          Alexandria. If one may judge from the later period, in which the
          relations between the school and the Church, between the bishop
          and the teacher, were frequently strained, the school grew only
          gradually into close connection with the Church; but the
          Alexandrian Church itself shows, at the transition from the
          second to the third century, a freer, less rigidly orthodox
          habit of thought, which gave place to the settled Catholic forms
          only in the episcopate of Demetrius, under Caracalla and
          Elagabalus.

  2. Its Development from Hellenism and Judaism.

          The catechetical school had forerunners in the Hellenistic
          "Museum" on one side, and in the Jewish schools (batte
          midrashot) on the other. The development of Helleno-Judaic
          learning, as seen in Philo, is a direct step to the Christian,
          which took up its inheritance. The speculations of the Egyptian
          Gnostics, the schools of Basilides and Valentinus, and those of
          the Church theologians proceed from the same source. Its
          theology is the science of interpreting the written documents;
          it is extracted from the divine oracles by means of the
          exegetic-pneumatic method. But access to the highest secrets is
          possible only by passing through various anterooms, designated
          on one side by the different disciplines of Greek philosophy,
          and on the other by special divine revelations. This progressive
          enlightenment corresponds to the constitution of nature and the
          human organism, with their long course of progressive
          development. The path thus marked out leads, however, naturally
          to apologetics, just as the preparatory study, in metaphysics
          and ethics, in knowledge and in divine love, leads to the laying
          of a foundation for the theological gnosis. All this has
          appeared already in Philo; and so has the essentially Platonic
          attitude toward the whole world of thought, the energetic effort
          to surpass Plato's idea by a hypernoeton (thus offering religion
          access in the form of the transcendental to a lofty region
          peculiarly its own), and the alchemistic process with the Bible
          by which it is made to yield not only the highest gnosis but
          also, when interpreted literally and morally, the theology of
          the preparatory stages.

  3. Christian Modifications.

          The Christian school made no radical change in this way of
          looking at things; but it modified the earlier views by giving
          the revelation of God in Christ precedence over the Old
          Testament law, which it placed practically on a level with Greek
          philosophy, and by accepting the Pauline-Johannean conception of
          the appearance of the Godhead (the Logos) on earth. The mystery
          of God coming down to his creature, or of the deification of the
          created spirit, now became the central thought of theology, and
          served to strengthen the long-existing conception of the
          essential affinity of the created spirit with its creator. The
          fundamental question whether the return of souls to God is only
          an apparent return (since really all the time they are in him),
          or a strictly necessary natural process, or the historical
          consequence of a historical event (the Incarnation), was never
          satisfactorily answered by the teachers of the catechetical
          school. The Alexandrian orthodox teachers are distinguished from
          the heretical by their serious attempt to save the freedom of
          the creature, and thus to place a boundary between God and man
          and to leave some scope for history; but the attitude of the
          Christian Gnostic, which Origen praises as the highest, leaves
          room neither for the historic Christ nor for the Logos, in fact
          for no mediator at all, but conceives everything as existing in
          calm immanence and blessedness--while this very teacher, as soon
          as he placed himself on one of the numerous steps which lie
          between man as a natural being and man as a blessed spirit,
          became the theologian of redemption, atonement, and mediation.

  4. Significance and Achievements.

          The catechetical school of Alexandria has a great significance
          as well for the internal history of the Church as for its
          relation to the world outside. It furnished the Church with a
          dogmatic theology; it taught it scientific exegesis, in the
          sense then understood, and gave it a scientific consciousness;
          it overthrew the heretical school; it laid down the main
          problems of future theology; and it transformed the primitive
          spirit of enthusiastic asceticism into one of contemplative
          asceticism. In regard to the outer world, it forced the Hellenic
          mind to take account of the message of Christianity, it led the
          conflict with the last phase of Greek philosophy, Neoplatonism,
          and defeated its enemies with their own weapons.

  5. Organization.

          The school had a settled organization under a single head. A
          knowledge of the course of study is obtained from the great
          tripartite work of Clement (the "Exhortation to the Heathen,"
          the "Instructor," and the "Miscellanies") and from accounts of
          Origen's teaching. The main subjects of the older philosophy
          were taught, but the principal thing, to which the whole course
          led up, was the study of Scripture. The school seems to have had
          no fixed domicile, at least in Origen's day, but to have met in
          the teacher's house. There were no fixed payments; rich friends
          and voluntary offerings from such as could afford them provided
          for its needs. The list of heads is as follows: Pantænus,
          Clement, Origen, Heracles, Dionysius (the latter two afterward
          bishops), Pierius (Achillas), Theognostus, Serapion, Peter
          (afterward bishop), Macarius (?) . . . Didymus, Rhodon. The
          last-named, the teacher of Philippus Sidetes, migrated to Side
          in Pamphylia about 405, and the school, shaken already by the
          Arian controversy and by the unsuccessful struggle of Theophilus
          with the barbarous monastic orthodoxy, became extinct.

  6. Later Developments.

          The theology of the Cappadocians, especially Gregory of Nyssa,
          is a product of the influence of the Alexandrian school, and in
          so far as this theology, with its echoes of Origenistic
          teaching, has never wholly died out, the work of the school has
          remained effective. It lived on also in the learning of Jerome,
          Rufinus, and Ambrose, and was valuable to the Western Church.
          Athanasius has nothing directly to do with the catechetical
          school, but his teaching on the incarnation of the Logos and his
          conception of the relations of God and man were in touch with
          one side of Origenistic speculation. By carrying through the
          Homoousios he brought about at the same time a view of the
          person of Christ according to which the divine nature has so
          absorbed the human, has so made the latter its own, that a
          practically complete unity of nature exists. He did not work
          this consequence out thoroughly; there are many uncertainties
          both in him and in the Cappadocians, his and Origen's disciples;
          but his teaching and his theological attitude led up to what was
          later called Monophysitism, in its strictest and most logical
          form. This attitude did not change when the Church felt obliged
          to repudiate the attempt of Apollinaris of Laodicea to represent
          Christ as a being in whom the Godhead took the place of the
          reasonable human soul. On the contrary, it was felt that the
          theoretical assertion of the complete and perfect human nature
          of Christ in opposition to Apollinaris was a sufficient
          protection against any dangers incurred in free speculation on
          the "one nature of the Word made flesh." These speculations were
          based on the conception of the possibility of a real fusion of
          the divine and human natures. This conception might be regarded
          in a twofold aspect, either from the standpoint of historic
          realism (the divine plan of salvation has historically brought
          together the two separate natures), or from that of philosophic
          idealism (the divine plan of salvation declares and makes plain
          what lies already in the nature of things, in so far as the
          intellectual creature is in the last resort substantially one
          with the Godhead). The connection of this with the later
          teaching of the school is evident; this connection, rooted as it
          is in Platonism, comes out in the pneumatic exegesis, although
          Origen's expositions, which seemed to offend against the rule of
          faith and Biblical realism, were rejected.

  7. Representatives of the Later School.

          The theologians who represented this line of thought, and who
          from the beginning of the fifth century are found in conflict
          with the school of Antioch, are called the Alexandrian school.
          After Macarius, the most important of them is Cyril, who is
          known by his numerous commentaries and polemical treatises, as
          well as by the victorious boldness of the position which he took
          in these controversies. While there may be two opinions about
          his character, there can be no doubt of the soteriological
          tendency of his theology. He succeeded in following up the
          partial victory which he won at the Council of Ephesus (431) and
          converting it into a complete one. His successor, Dioscurus,
          accomplished the entire defeat of the theology of Antioch, and
          at Ephesus in 449 the "one nature of the Word made flesh" was
          proclaimed to the East. At Chalcedon in 451 came the reaction,
          but it was brought about not so much by any opposition in the
          Eastern mind to the formula as by the despotic bearing of its
          champion. That which was adopted at Chalcedon roundly
          contradicted, indeed, the Alexandrian theology, but inasmuch as
          Cyril's orthodoxy was expressly recognized there, the new
          Byzantine-Roman Church, in spite of its teaching on the two
          natures, found a place for the Alexandrian school. In the sixth
          century Leontius and Justinian showed (Second Council of
          Constantinople, 553) that its influence was not dead--that, on
          the contrary, the exposition of the decrees of Chalcedon must be
          determined in accordance with it. No fundamental difference
          appeared in the attitude of the sixth council (Constantinople,
          680-681); and after the Adoptionist controversy the Western
          theology also became consciously Alexandrian. It has never been
          able to do more than theoretically to assert the real humanity
          of Christ, or to reduce it to very narrow limits; it is, after
          all, essentially Apollinarian and docetic. Consequently in all
          its phases it has left room for mystical speculations on the
          relation of the Godhead and humanity, in which the human factor
          tends to disappear and history to be forgotten.

   Alexians
          ALEXIANS: An order, aiming to care for the sick and bury the
          dead, which originated in the Netherlands at the time of the
          black death about the middle of the fourteenth century. The
          members were at first called Cellitæ (Dutch, Gellebroeders,
          "Cell-brothers") and Lollards, or Nollards, on account of their
          monotonous intoning at burials. When and where they chose St.
          Alexius--according to the legend, a son of rich parents who gave
          all his possessions to the poor, lived for many years
          unrecognized as a beggar in his father's house, and died July
          17, 417--as patron is not known. The place may have been
          Antwerp, or Cologne, or elsewhere in Lower Germany. A certain
          Tobias is said to have had a part in their foundation, and the
          name Fratres voluntarie pauperes, which is sometimes applied to
          them, may have been their oldest and chosen designation. From
          the fifteenth century they were found in great numbers in
          Belgium and western Germany. In 1459 Pius II. permitted them to
          take the solemn vows. To avoid being taken for Beghards, and to
          escape persecution, they adopted the monastic rule of St.
          Augustine (with black cassock), and Sixtus IV. confirmed the
          arrangement in 1472. Later they appeared in the four provinces
          of the Upper Rhine, Middle Rhine, Flanders, and Brabant, without
          central government or priests at the head of the different
          monasteries. [240]Jan Busch, the monastic reformer of the
          fifteenth century, took note of their illiterate and deficient
          lay character. A reform of the order, which was verging on
          decay, was undertaken in 1854 by the monastery of Mariaberg in
          Aachen, and was confirmed by Pius IX. in 1870. About fifteen
          houses, for both sexes, scattered over western Germany, are
          affiliated with Aachen, and there are others in Belgium.

   Alexius I., Comnenus
          ALEXIUS I., ??-lex´i-us, COMNENUS: Emperor of Constantinople
          1081-1118, founder of the Comnenus dynasty. He was the nephew of
          Isaac Comnenus, who as emperor (1057-59) had tried through the
          army to save the state from the selfish tyranny of the official
          class, but had been put to death, with the result that for two
          decades military weakness, administrative demoralization, and
          the loss of provinces to Turks and Normans had brought the
          empire into an almost hopeless condition. During this period
          Alexius won considerable renown by defeating a Norman mercenary
          captain named Ursel, who attempted to found a kingdom in Asia
          Minor, and two pretenders to the imperial throne. He was adopted
          by the empress Maria, but found himself so zealously watched in
          Constantinople that his only safety was to seize the crown for
          himself, which he accomplished by a masterly conspiracy. New
          dangers, however, threatened him. Asia Minor was largely in
          Mohammedan hands; the sovereignty of the empire in the Balkan
          peninsula was scarcely more than nominal; and Robert Guiscard
          menaced the Adriatic provinces, having already taken the south
          Italian ones. Alexius summoned his forces, and ratified the
          burdensome treaty with Venice which his predecessor had made,
          but he was defeated, and the Normans occupied Durazzo, the
          western gate of the empire. He tried to create a diversion by
          inciting the German king, Henry IV., to an attack on southern
          Italy, which afforded only temporary relief, and nothing but
          Robert's death in 1085 saved him from this determined foe.

          Steady pressure from the half-barbarous hordes of the Balkans
          made a new danger, and at one time it seemed likely that the
          Turkish pirates of Asia Minor and the Sultan of Iconium would
          join them in an attempt to effect the complete overthrow of the
          empire. By the aid of the Cumans, however, they were defeated
          with horrible slaughter (1091). The lack of military force
          inspired Alexius with the idea of gaining assistance from the
          West. The first crusade (1095-99), partly due to his appeals for
          the expulsion of the Turks, assumed far different proportions
          from those which he had expected; but he might have welcomed it,
          had it not been that the participation of Bohemund, Robert
          Guiscard's son, gave it the appearance of a mere episode in the
          old Norman inroads. At first all went peaceably, but mutual
          distrust soon showed itself. At the siege of Nicæa (1097),
          Alexius did not wait to see if the crusaders would fulfil their
          agreement to restore to him the territory which had but recently
          belonged to the empire, but gained the city by a secret
          agreement with the Turkish garrison. When Antioch fell (1098),
          it was not restored to the emperor. This marked the crisis of
          the undertaking. The Turks threatened to recapture Antioch, and
          Alexius was entreated to send the help he had promised. He saw
          that by giving it he would make the Turks his irreconcilable
          foes, without finding submissive vassals in the crusaders, and
          he drew back, seizing the opportunity to recover possession of
          the coasts of Asia Minor, with the large maritime cities and the
          islands, and then using this recovered territory as a base of
          operations against the new Norman principality in Syria.
          Bohemund found himself obliged in 1104 to seek help from the
          pope and the kings of England and France. He spread the belief
          that Alexius was the enemy of Christianity and a master of all
          deceits and wiles. A new crusade, led by Bohemund, sought to
          pass through the Eastern empire, but its purpose was perfectly
          understood in Constantinople. Preparations were made in time,
          and in the winter of 1107-08 Alexius won the greatest triumph of
          his reign. Bohemund was forced to submit to the humiliating
          conditions of the treaty of Deabolis, and to hold Antioch as a
          fief of the empire, without the right to transmit it. The last
          ten years of Alexius's reign were years of struggle for the
          maintenance of his recovered dominion in Asia Minor, and for the
          consolidation of his power at home. To gain the help of the
          ecclesiastics, as well as to atone for the sins of his youth, he
          regulated the life of his court with great strictness, and did
          his utmost to repress the sects (Paulicians, Armenians,
          Monophysites, and Bogomiles) which had flourished in the anarchy
          of the time immediately preceding his own.

          It is difficult to arrive at an unprejudiced view of Alexius's
          character, so much have the one-sided views of the Western
          historians prevailed. His success in making the weakened empire
          once more a power must be admired. He was a man of infinite
          resource, of tremendous energy, of an indefatigable readiness to
          avail himself of circumstances, not wanting in physical courage,
          but even greater in moral steadfastness.

   Alford, Henry
          ALFORD, HENRY: Dean of Canterbury; b. in London Oct. 7, 1810; d.
          at Canterbury Jan. 12, 1871. He studied at Trinity College,
          Cambridge (B.A., 1832), and was ordained deacon in 1833, priest
          in 1834, and elected a fellow of Trinity the same year; he
          became vicar of Wymeswold, Leicestershire, 1835, minister of
          Quebec Chapel, Marylebone, London, in 1853, and dean of
          Canterbury in 1857. He was a many-sided man, a good musician, a
          wood-carver and painter of some skill, a good preacher, and for
          many years a successful teacher of private pupils. His
          publications include sermons, lectures, essays and reviews,
          poems, hymns, a translation of the Odyssey in blank verse
          (London, 1861), an edition of the works of John Donne (6 vols.,
          1839), The Queen's English (1864), and even a novel, Netherton
          on Sea (1869), written in collaboration with his niece
          (Elizabeth M. Alford). He was Hulsean lecturer for 1841-42 and
          published his lectures under the title, The Consistency of the
          Divine Conduct in Revealing the Doctrines of Redemption (2
          vols.). He was the first editor of the Contemporary Review
          (1866-70). The great work of his life, however, was his Greek
          Testament (4 vols., London, 1849-61; thoroughly revised in
          subsequent editions), which introduced German New Testament
          scholarship to English readers, and involved a vast amount of
          patient labor. An outcome of this work was The New Testament for
          English Readers (4 vols., 1868) and a revised English version
          (1869). He was one of the original members of the New Testament
          Revision Committee. Near the close of his life he projected a
          commentary on the Old Testament, and prepared the Book of
          Genesis and part of Exodus, which were published posthumously
          (1872).

   Alfred the Great
          ALFRED (ÆLFRED) THE GREAT: King of the West Saxons 871-901; b.
          at Wantage (60 m. w. of London), Berkshire, 849; d. at
          Winchester, Hants, Oct. 28, 901. He was the youngest son of
          Ethelwulf and Osburga, and succeeded his brother Ethelred on the
          throne. His reign, with its recurring conflicts with the Danes,
          contained many vicissitudes; nevertheless, he succeeded in
          establishing his power, enlarged the borders of his realm, and
          advanced the spiritual and intellectual welfare of his people.
          He remodeled the political and ecclesiastical organization of
          his kingdom, rebuilt the churches, monasteries, and schools
          burnt by the Danes, and founded new ones. He invited learned men
          to his country and provided for them there, and through the
          intimate connection which he maintained with Rome he was able to
          procure books and form libraries. Of still greater import were
          his personal exertions to arouse among his countrymen a desire
          for knowledge and culture. He translated Boethius's De
          consolatione philosophiæ and the history of Orosius. Both works
          are treated with great freedom, much change was necessary to
          adapt them to the needs of the rude Saxons, and Alfred himself
          did not always fully understand his text. There are many
          omissions and additions. The work of Orosius (an attempt to
          write a history of the world from a Christian standpoint) is
          supplemented by a geographical and ethnological review of
          Scandinavia and the Baltic countries from the reports of Othhere
          and Wulfstan. Of greater importance from a religious point of
          view is Alfred's translation of the Liber pastoralis curæ of
          Pope Gregory I. (590-604), a book well adapted to influence the
          spirit of the Saxon clergy. A paraphrase of Bede's Historia
          ecclesiastica gentis Anglorum has been erroneously ascribed to
          Alfred; it may, however, have been prepared under his direction.
          Translations or paraphrases of the Dialogus of Gregory I. and of
          the "Soliloquies" of St. Augustine have also been ascribed to
          him. His millennary was celebrated at Winchester in 1901, and
          commemorative exercises were held in America also.

          essay, were published in a "Jubilee Edition," 3 vols., Oxford,

   Alfric
          ALFRIC, al´fric (ÆLFRIC) (Alfricus Grammaticus): Anglo-Saxon
          abbot. He was a scholar and friend of Athelwold of Abingdon,
          afterward bishop of Winchester (c. 963), and was abbot of Cerne
          in Dorsetshire and of Ensham (c. 1006). He has been identified,
          probably with insufficient reason, with Alfric, archbishop of
          Canterbury (996-1006), and with Alfric, archbishop of York
          (1023-51). He did much for the education of clergy and people,
          and his name is second only to that of King Alfred as a writer
          of Anglo-Saxon prose. He was a strong opponent of the doctrine
          of transubstantiation. His writings include a grammar with
          glossary, a collection of homilies, and a translation of the
          first seven books of the Old Testament. The Elfric Society was
          founded in London in 1842 to publish his works as well as
          others. For this society B. Thorpe edited two books of the
          homilies (2 vols., London, 1844-46); the third book has been
          edited by W. Skeat (Ælfric's Lives of Saints, London, 1881). The
          grammar may be found in the Sammlung englischer Denkmäler,
          Berlin, 1880; the Heptateuchus, in C. W. M. Grein, Bibliothek
          der angelsächsischen Prosa, i. (Cassel, 1872).

   Alger, of Liege
          ALGER, ??l´´zhê´, OF LIÉGE (ALGER OF CLUNY, Algerus
          Scholasticus, and Algerus Magister): Theological writer of the
          twelfth century; d. at Cluny 1131 or 1132. He enjoyed the
          instruction of the best teachers in the cathedral school of
          Liége, which was then the great school of northwestern Germany,
          and a nursery of high-church notions. Alger, afterward
          scholasticus at the cathedral, does not seem to have been a
          champion of this tendency. After the death of Bishop Frederick,
          in 1121, he retired to the monastery of Cluny, where he lived on
          very friendly terms with Abbot Peter. He is described as a man
          of great intellect, a wise counselor, faithful in every respect,
          of wide learning, yet modest and unassuming. The most noteworthy
          of his writings are: (1) De sacramentis corporis et sanguinis
          domini libri iii., which occupies a prominent place among the
          rejoinders to Berengar's doctrine of the Eucharist. The first
          book treats of the doctrine of the substantial presence of
          Christ in the Eucharist, aiming to prove it from Scripture and
          tradition; it then treats of the reception of the sacrament,
          especially of worthy participation. The second book treats of
          different controversies respecting the matter, form, and
          efficacy of the sacraments. The third opposes especially those
          who make the legality and efficacy of the sacrament dependent on
          the worthiness of the dispenser. The difficult questions are
          treated clearly and acutely. In the main Alger follows Guitmund
          of Aversa, but not without expansion of his doctrine in some
          points. He was the first to assert the two propositions that the
          human nature of Christ because of its exaltation above all
          creatures has the faculty of remaining where it pleases and
          existing at the same sime undivided in every other place and
          that the sensual qualities of the elements exist after the
          transubstantiation as accidentia per se, i.e., without subject.
          (2) In the Tractatus de misericordia et justitia, important for
          the history of canon law and Church discipline, Alger attempts
          to explain and harmonize the apparent contra dictions between
          the different laws of the Church. Each proposition is given in a
          brief thesis or title, followed by numerous quotations from
          Scripture, the Fathers, councils, and genuine and spurious papal
          decretals as proofs; the authorities which seem to oppose each
          other, are put in juxtaposition; and a reconciliation is
          attempted. Many patristic passages as well as many of the
          explanatory chapter headings are copied from this work in the
          Decretum Gratiani. Alger, however, was not the only predecessor
          and pattern of Gratian, as the whole development of
          ecclesiastical and canonical science was in that direction.

   Allard, Paul
          ALLARD, ??l´´l??r´, PAUL: Layman, French Christian archeologist;
          b. at Rouen Sept. 15, 1841. He was educated at the Collège Libre
          de Bois-Guillaume (near Rouen) and at the Faculté de Droit of
          Paris. He was admitted to the bar, and for many years has been a
          judge in the civil court of his native city. He is a member of
          the Rouen Academy, as well as of the Académie de Religion
          Catholique and the Académie Pontificale d'Archéologie, both of
          Rome. He is likewise a corresponding member of the Société des
          Antiquaires de France, and the editor of the Revue des
          traditions historiques of Paris. His chief works are: Les
          Esclaves chrétiens depuis les premiers temps de l'Église jusqu'à
          la fin de la domination romaine en Occident (Paris, 1876;
          crowned by the French Academy); L'Art paien sous les empereurs
          chrétiens (1879); Esclaves, serfs et mainmortables (1884);
          Histoire des persécutions (4 vols., 1882-90); Le Christianisme
          et l'empire romain de Néron a Thédose (1897); Saint Basile
          (1898); Études d'histoire et d'archéologie (1898); Julian
          l'Apostat (3 vols., 1900-03; crowned by the French Academy); Les
          Chrétiens et l'incendie de Rome sous Néron (1903); Les
          Persécutions et la critique moderne (1903); and Dix leçons sur
          le martyre (1906). He has also made a translation, with
          additions and notes, of the Roma Sotterranea of Northcote and
          Brownlow under the title Rome souterraine (Paris, 1873).

   Allatius, Leo
          ALLATIUS, al-lê´shius or -shus, LEO (LEONE ALACCI): Roman
          Catholic scholar; b. on the island of Chios 1586; d. in Rome
          Jan. 19, 1669. He was brought to Calabria at the age of nine,
          and in 1600 went to Rome, where he became one of the most
          distinguished pupils of the Greek College founded in 1577 by
          Gregory XIII. He studied philosophy and theology, and later also
          medicine at the Sapienza, and became a teacher in the Greek
          College and a scriptor in the Vatican library. When Maximilian
          of Bavaria presented the Heidelberg library to the pope (1622),
          Allatius was chosen to superintend its removal to Rome, and he
          spent nearly a year in the work. The death of Gregory XV. just
          before his return deprived him of a fitting reward; and he was
          even suspected of having appropriated or given away part of this
          charge. He was supported by the liberality of some of the
          cardinals, especially Francesco Barberini, who made him his
          private librarian (1638). Alexander VII. appointed him keeper of
          the Vatican library in 1661, and he lived the retired life of a
          scholar until his death. Allatius's contemporaries regarded him
          as a prodigy of learning and diligence, though apparently
          somewhat narrow and pedantic, and without much critical
          judgment. His literary productions were of the most varied kind.
          The interests which lay nearest to his heart were the
          demonstration that the Greek and Roman Churches had always been
          in substantial agreement, and the bringing of his fellow
          countrymen to acknowledge the supremacy of Rome. His principal
          writings, the De ecclesiæ occidentalis et orientalis perpetua
          consensione (Cologne, 1648), and the smaller De utriusque
          ecclesiæ in dogmate de purgatorio consensione (Rome, 1655), bear
          upon this subject; his Confutatio fabulae de papissa (1630) aims
          to vindicate the papacy. He was vigorously opposed by Protestant
          scholars, such as Hottinger, Veiel, and Spanheim, and some Roman
          Catholics (as R. Simon) admitted that his treatment of history
          was one-sided. He found an ardent helper in the German convert
          B. Neuhaus (Nihusius), the pupil and then the opponent of
          Calixtus. Allatius published many other works of a similar
          tendency, e.g., on the procession of the Holy Ghost (1658), the
          Athanasian Creed (1659), the Synod of Photius (1662), and the
          Council of Florence (1674). He also edited, annotated, or
          translated a number of Greek authors, both ecclesiastical and
          secular, and contributed to the Paris Corpus Byzantinorum. He
          left behind him plans and preliminary studies for still more
          extensive undertakings, such as a complete library, of all the
          Greek authors. His literary remains, and an extensive
          correspondence, comprising more than 1,000 letters in Greek and
          Latin, came in 1803 into the possession of the library of the
          Oratorians in Rome.

   Allegri, Gregorio
          ALLEGRI, ??l-lê´grî, GREGORIO: Italian composer; b. in Rome, of
          the family of the Correggios, most probably about 1585; d. there
          Feb. 18, 1652. He studied music under Nanini (1600-07), and
          after 1629 belonged to the choir of the Sistine Chapel. He was
          one of the first to compose for stringed instruments. His most
          celebrated work is a Miserere for two choirs, one of five and
          the other of four voices, which, as given at Rome during Holy
          Week, acquired a great reputation. For a long time extraordinary
          efforts were made to prevent the publication of the music; but
          Mozart at the age of fourteen was able to write it down from
          memory, and Dr. Charles Burney (author of the History of Music)
          procured a copy from another source and published it in La
          musica che si canta annualmente nelle funzioni della settimana
          santa, nella cappella pontificia (London, 1771). The effect of
          the Miserere as given in Rome seems to be due to the
          associations and execution rather than to any inherent quality
          in the music, as presentations of it elsewhere have proved
          distinctly disappointing.

          (86 m. w. of London), Wiltshire, 1634; d. at Taunton,
          Somersetshire, Nov. 17, 1668. He was graduated at Oxford in 1653
          and became chaplain to his college (Corpus Christi); in 1655 he
          became assistant minister at Taunton, whence he was ejected for
          non-conformity in 1662; he continued to preach and was twice
          imprisoned in consequence, and his later years were troubled by
          constant danger of arrest. He was a learned man, associated as
          an equal with the fellows of the Royal Society, and engaged in
          scientific study and experimentation. He is now remembered,
          however, as the author of An Alarm to Unconverted Sinners
          (London, 1672; republished in 1675 under the title A Sure Guide
          to Heaven). He published several other works, including an
          Explanation of the Assembly's Shorter Catechism (1656).

          ALLEINE, RICHARD: English non-conformist; b. at Ditcheat (18 m.
          s. by w. of Bath) 1611; d. at Frome Selwood (11 m. s. by e. of
          Bath) Dec. 22, 1681. He was educated at Oxford and was rector of
          Batcombe (15 m. s. by w. of Bath) from 1641 till ejected for
          non-conformity in 1662, when he removed to Frome Selwood, only a
          few miles away, and there preached. His fame rests on his
          Vindiciæ pietatis, or a vindication of godliness, in four parts,
          each with a different title (London, 1663-68).

   Allemand, Louis D
          ALLEMAND, ??l´´m??n´ (ALEMAN), LOUIS D': Archbishop of Arles and
          cardinal; b. of noble family at the castle of Arbent (in the old
          district of Bugey, 55 m. n.e. of Lyons), department of Ain, 1380
          or 1381; d. at Salon (28 m. w.n.w. of Marseilles), department of
          Bouches du Rhône, Sept. 16, 1450. While quite young he was made
          canon of Lyons; he became magister and decretorum doctor and as
          such took part in the Council of Constance; in 1418 he became
          bishop of Magelone, in 1423 archbishop of Arles, and in 1426
          cardinal with the title of St. Cecilia. During the council at
          Basel, he became the center of the opposition against pope
          Eugenius IV., and when in 1438 the rupture occurred between the
          council and the pope, Allemand was the only cardinal who
          remained at Basel and directed the transactions. Eugenius
          declared that Allemand and all who had taken part in the council
          had forfeited their dignities, but Allemand continued to work in
          favor of the council and in the interest of the election of
          Felix V. When, however, this antipope resigned (1449), and the
          Fathers of Basel submitted to Pope Nicholas V., Allemand also
          was restored. He died in the odor of sanctity, and was buried at
          Arles. Clement VII. beatified him in 1527.

   Allen, Alexander Viets Griswold
          ALLEN, ALEXANDER VIETS GRISWOLD: Protestant Episcopalian; b. at
          Otis, Mass., May 4, 1841. He was educated at Kenyon College,
          Gambier, O. (B.A., 1862), and Andover Theological Seminary
          (1865), and was ordained priest in the Protestant Episcopal
          Church in 1865. He was the founder and first rector of St.
          John's Church, Lawrence, Mass., in 1865-67, and in the latter
          year was appointed professor of church history in the Episcopal
          Theological School, Cambridge, Mass., where he still remains.
          Since 1886 he has been a member of the Massachusetts Historical
          Society. His principal writings are: Continuity of Christian
          Thought (Boston, 1884); Life of Jonathan Edwards (1889);
          Religious Progress (1893; lecture delivered at Yale University);
          Christian Institutions (New York, 1897); and Life and Letters of
          Phillips Brooks (1900).

   Allen, Henry
          ALLEN, HENRY: Founder of the Allenites; b. at Newport, R. I.,
          June 14, 1748; d. at Northhampton, N. H., Feb. 2, 1784. Without
          proper training he became a preacher, and while settled at
          Falmouth, Nova Scotia, about 1778, began to promulgate peculiar
          views in sermons and tracts. He held that all souls are
          emanations or parts of the one Great Spirit; that all were
          present in the Garden of Eden and took actual part in the fall;
          that the human body and the entire material world were only
          created after the fall and as a consequence of it; that in time
          all souls will be embodied, and when the original number have
          thus passed through a state of probation, all will receive
          eternal reward or punishment in their original unembodied state.
          He denied the resurrection of the body, and treated baptism, the
          Lord's Supper, and ordination as matters of indifference. He
          traveled throughout Nova Scotia and made many zealous converts.
          The number of these, however, dwindled away after his death.

          Artaine, near Dublin, July 27, 1534, during the rebellion of
          Lord Thomas Fitzgerald. He studied at both Oxford and Cambridge;
          was sent to Rome on ecclesiastical business by Archbishop
          Warham, and spent several years there; held various benefices in
          England, and became an adherent of Cardinal Wolsey and his agent
          in the spoliation of religious houses; was nominated archbishop
          of Dublin Aug., 1528 (consecrated Mar., 1529), and a month later
          was made chancellor of Ireland. He was involved in Wolsey's
          fall, impoverished by it, and lost the chancellorship. He was a
          learned canonist, and wrote an Epistola de pallii
          significatione, when he received the pallium, and a treatise De
          consuetudinibus ac statutis in tutoriis causis observandis. He
          compiled two registers, the Liber niger and the Repertorium
          viride, which give valuable information regarding his diocese
          and the state of the churches.

          school. His chief work was Modern Judaism: or a Brief Account of
          the Opinions, Traditions, Rites, and Ceremonies of the Jews in
          Modern Times (London, 1816); he published also (1813) what was
          long the standard English translation of Calvin's Institutes of
          the Christian Religion.

   Allen, Joseph Henry
          ALLEN, JOSEPH HENRY: American Unitarian; b. at Northborough,
          Mass., Aug. 21, 1820; d. at Cambridge, Mass., Mar. 20, 1898. He
          was graduated at Harvard in 1840, and at the Cambridge Divinity
          School in 1843, and became pastor at Jamaica Plain (Roxbury),
          Mass. (1843), Washington, D. C. (1847), and Bangor, Me. (1850).
          In 1857 he returned to Jamaica Plain, and thenceforth devoted
          himself to teaching and literary work, often supplying the
          pulpits of neighboring towns, and with brief pastorates at Ann
          Arbor, Mich. (1877-78), Ithaca, N. Y. (1883-84), and San Diego,
          Cal. After 1867 he lived in Cambridge and was lecturer on
          ecclesiastical history in Harvard University, 1878-82. He was
          editor of The Christian Examiner (1857-69) and of The Unitarian
          Review (1887-91); with his brother, W. F. Allen, and J. B.
          Greenough he prepared the Allen and Greenough series of Latin
          text-books. He translated and edited an English edition of
          certain of the works of Renan (History of the People of Israel,
          5 vols., Boston, 1888-95; The Future of Science, 1891; The Life
          of Jesus, 1895; Antichrist, 1897; The Apostles, 1898); and
          published, among other works, Ten Discourses on Orthodoxy
          (Boston, 1849); Hebrew Men and Times from the Patriarchs to the
          Messiah (1861); Our Liberal Movement in Theology, chiefly as
          shown in recollections of the History of Unitarianism in New

   Allen, William
          ALLEN, WILLIAM: 1. "The cardinal of England;" b. at Rossall (36
          m. n. of Liverpool), Lancashire, 1532; d. at Rome Oct. 16, 1594.
          He entered Oriel College, Oxford, in 1547 (B.A. and fellow,
          1550; M.A., 1554), and after the accession of Mary decided to
          devote himself to the Church. He became principal of St. Mary's
          Hall, Oxford, and proctor of the university in 1556, canon of
          York in 1558. His zeal for the Roman religion soon attracted the
          notice of the authorities under Elizabeth, and in 1561 he left
          Oxford for the University of Louvain. In 1562 he came home, much
          broken in health, and spent the next three years in England,
          constantly encouraging the Catholics and making converts. He
          left his native land for good in 1565, was ordained priest at
          Mechlin, and lectured on theology in the Benedictine college
          there. He conceived the idea of a college for English students
          on the Continent, and in 1568 opened the first and most famous
          of such institutions, that at [244]Douai. He continued to
          administer and serve the college till 1588, although in 1585 he
          had removed to Rome. Pope Sixtus V., raised him to the
          cardinalate in 1587. Philip II. nominated him archbishop of
          Mechlin, 1589, but he was not preconized by the pope. Gregory
          XIV. made him prefect of the Vatican library.

          The great aim of Allen's life was to restore England to the
          Church of Rome. This aim he pursued persistently. Until his
          fiftieth year he contented himself with persuasive measures
          alone ("scholastical attempts," in his own words), and met with
          no inconsiderable success. Had it not been for the missioners
          who were continually going into the country from his schools,
          probably the Roman Catholic religion would have perished as
          completely in England as it did in Scandinavian countries.

          About 1582 Allen began to meditate force and to interfere in
          politics. He was closely associated with [245]Robert Parsons,
          was cognizant of the plots to depose Elizabeth, and became the
          head of the "Spanish party" in England. It was at the request of
          Philip II. that he was appointed cardinal; and the intention was
          to make him papal legate, archbishop of Canterbury, and lord
          chancellor, and to entrust to him the organization of the
          ecclesiastical affairs of the country, if the proposed invasion
          of England should succeed. Just before the Armada sailed he
          indorsed, if he did not write, An Admonition to the Nobility and
          people of England and Ireland concerning the present wars, made
          for the execution of his Holiness's sentence, by the King
          Catholic of Spain (printed at Antwerp), and an abridgment of the
          same, called A Declaration of the Sentence of Deposition of
          Elizabeth, the Usurper and Pretensed Queen of England, which was
          disseminated in the form of a broadside. Both publications were
          violent and scurrilous, as well as treasonable from the English
          point of view, and roused great indignation in England, even
          among the Catholics, who, unlike Allen, very generally remained
          true to their country and sovereign. Allen's conduct, however,
          it should be borne in mind, was consistent with his belief in
          papal supremacy and with his views concerning excommunication
          and the right of the spiritual authorities to punish. He is
          described as handsome and dignified in person, courteous in
          manner, and endowed with many attractive qualities. Stories
          concerning his wealth and the princely style in which he lived
          in Rome are not true.

          (see [246]Bible Versions, B, IV., § 5, [247]A, II., 2, § 5). At

          later the Supreme Court of the United States declared the
          reorganization invalid. He was president of Bowdoin College,

          educated at Eton, Cambridge, and Oxford, espoused the cause of
          the Reformation, but kept in retirement during the reign of
          Mary. Elizabeth made him divinity reader in St. Paul's, and in
          1560 Bishop of Exeter. He revised the Book of Deuteronomy for
          the Bishops' Bible, and published an exposition of I Peter, with
          notes which show wide reading (2 vols., London, 1565).

   Alliance of the Reformed Churches
          ALLIANCE OF THE REFORMED CHURCHES:

  Origin.

          A voluntary organization formed in London in 1875, on the model
          of the Evangelical Alliance; but confined to Churches of
          presbyterial polity and more churchly in the character of its
          representation. The official name is "Alliance of the Reformed
          Churches Holding the Presbyterian System" and popularly the
          Alliance is known as the "Presbyterian Alliance." The calling of
          the Council of Trent suggested to Cranmer a synod of Protestants
          to make a union creed, and in the spring of 1552 he wrote to
          Melanchthon, Bullinger, and Calvin on the subject and received
          favorable responses but nothing came of it. Beza in 1561 made a
          similar proposition, with as little results. So also in 1578 in
          the Scottish Second Book of Discipline and in 1709 in the
          collection of Scottish church laws, place is given to the idea.
          But it was not till 1870, when President James McCosh of
          Princeton College, first, and Rev. Prof. William Garden Blaikie,
          of Edinburgh, second, proposed that the different Presbyterian
          and Reformed Churches should get together in a conference, that
          tangible results followed. In 1873 the General Assembly of the
          Presbyterian Church in Ireland and that of the Presbyterian
          Church of the United States simultaneously appointed committees
          to correspond with other Churches on the subject. This led to
          the holding of a meeting in New York, Oct. 6, 1873, during the
          sessions of the Sixth General Conference of the Evangelical
          Alliance, at which a committee was appointed to bring the matter
          before the Presbyterian Churches through out the world and to
          obtain their concurrence and cooperation. This committee issued
          an address in which they distinctly stated that what was
          proposed was not that the Churches "should merge their separate
          existence in one large organization; but that, retaining their
          self-government, they should meet with the other members of the
          Presbyterian family to consult for the good of the Church at
          large, and for the glory of God." The proposal met with such
          general approval that in July, 1875, a conference was held at
          the English Presbyterian College in London. At this meeting,
          which lasted four days, and where nearly one hundred delegates,
          representing many Churches, attended, a constitution for the
          proposed Alliance was prepared, from which the following are
          extracts:--

          "1. This Alliance shall be known as The Alliance of the Reformed
          Churches throughout the world holding the Presbyterian system.

          "2. Any Church organized on Presbyterian principles, which holds
          the supreme authority of the Scriptures of the Old and New
          Testaments in matters of faith and morals, and whose creed is in
          harmony with the consensus of the Reformed Churches, shall be
          eligible for admission into the Alliance."

          It was also proposed that there should be a triennial council of
          delegates, ministers and elders, in equal numbers, to be
          appointed by the different Churches in proportion to the number
          of their congregations; and that this council, while at liberty
          to consider all matters of common interest, should "not
          interfere with the existing creed or constitution of any Church
          in the Alliance, or with its internal order or external
          relations."

  Aims and Achievements.

          The Alliance which was thus proposed was one, not of individual
          church members, but of Reformed and Presbyterian Churches as
          such. Its constitution met with great favor. It furnished an
          opportunity for the different church organizations to come into
          close fraternal relations with each other while retaining their
          separate existence and independence. Since its formation, the
          Alliance has held a General Council in each of the following
          cities, Edinburgh (1877), Philadelphia (1881), Belfast (1884),
          London (1888), Toronto (1892), Glasgow (1896), Washington
          (1899), and Liverpool (1904), at all of which questions of
          doctrine, polity, Home and Foreign Missions, and other forms of
          Christian activity have been fully discussed, the papers read
          with the subsequent discussions being published in a volume of
          proceedings. The Alliance is the rallying-point of the Reformed
          and Presbyterian Churches of the world, all of these with one or
          two exceptions having joined its fellowship. Its membership thus
          embraces not only the English-speaking Churches of Great Britain
          and America and the historic Churches of the European Continent,
          but also the Churches in the colonial and other territories of
          Great Britain, with the newly formed Churches which are the
          fruit of missionary labor among non-Christian peoples. Through
          the Alliance the special conditions of each Church have become
          better known to sister Churches than they had been previously,
          and hence, not only by sympathy and counsel, but also by large
          financial aid, the Alliance has sought to assist the weaker
          communities.

          The General Councils of the Alliance are neither mass-meetings
          nor conferences open to all, but consist exclusively of
          delegates appointed by the several Churches; yet neither are
          they synods or church courts, for they have no legislative
          authority of any kind and can only submit to all the Churches or
          to such as may be specially interested, any conclusions which
          they have reached. For administrative purposes, the Alliance has
          divided its Executive Commission or Business Committee into an
          Eastern Section located in Great Britain, and a Western Section
          located in the United States, but working in harmony with each
          other by constant intercorrespondence. As representing about
          thirty millions of souls, holding a common system of doctrine
          and adhering to a common polity and whose voluntary
          contributions for church purposes were reported at the Liverpool
          Council in 1904 as amounting in the previous year to
          considerably more than thirty-eight millions of dollars, the
          Alliance forms to-day one of the most closely united and
          influential organizations of Christendom.

          ALLIES, THOMAS WILLIAM: English Roman Catholic; b. at Midsomer
          Norton (14 m. n.e. of Glastonbury), Somersetshire, Feb. 12,
          1813; d. at St. John's Wood, London, June 17, 1903. He was first
          class in classics at Oxford, 1832. He took orders in the
          Anglican Church in 1838, serving for two years as chaplain to
          the bishop of London and for ten years as rector of Launton. In
          1850 he was received into the Roman Catholic Church by his
          friend, Cardinal, then Father, Newman. He wrote extensively on
          theological subjects, his principal works being, St. Peter, his
          Name and Office (London, 1852); The Formation of Christendom (8
          vols., 1861-95); Per crucem ad lucem (2 vols., 1879); A Life's
          Decision (1880); Church and State (1882), a continuation of The
          Formation of Christendom; and The Throne of the Fisherman
          (1887).

   Allioli, Josef Franz
          ALLIOLI, ??l´´lî-O´lî, JOSEF FRANZ: Roman Catholic; b. at
          Sulzbach, Austria, Aug.10, 1793; d. at Augsburg May 22, 1873. He
          studied theology at Landshut and Regensburg, and Oriental
          languages at Vienna, Rome, and Paris. In 1823 he became
          professor of Oriental languages and Biblical exegesis and
          archeology at Landshut, and went to Munich when the university
          was removed thither in 1826. In 1835, being compelled to give up
          teaching through throat trouble, he became a member of the
          cathedral chapter at Munich and, in 1838, provost of the
          cathedral at Augsburg. He was active in charitable work and
          promoted the Franciscan Female Institute of the Star of Mary.
          The most noteworthy of his numerous publications was Die heilige
          Schrift des Alten und Neuen Testaments aus der Vulgata mit Bezug
          auf den Grundtext neu übersetzt und mit kurzen Anmerkungen
          erläutert (6 vols., Nuremberg, 1830-34), a third edition of an
          earlier work by H. Braun (ib. 1786). It far surpassed its
          predecessors, received papal sanction, and has been often
          reissued.

   Allix, Pierre
          ALLIX, ??´´lîx´, PIERRE: Controversialist of the French Reformed
          Church; b. at Alençon (118 m. w.s.w. of Paris), Orne dept.,
          1641; d. in London Mar. 3, 1717. He was educated in the
          theological seminary at Sedan, and held pastoral charges at
          Saint-Agobile in Champagne and at Charenton. On the revocation
          of the Edict of Nantes (1685) he went to England, and James II.
          allowed him to establish a church in London for the numerous
          French exiles using the liturgy of the Church of England. In
          1690 he was appointed canon of Salisbury. The fame of his
          learning was so great that both Oxford and Cambrige conferred
          the degree of doctor upon him, and the English clergy requested
          him to write a complete history of the councils. This great work
          was to embrace seven folio volumes, but it never appeared. His
          published writings, in French, English, and Latin, are mostly of
          a polemical or apologetic nature, and display a thorough
          knowledge of Christian antiquity and of the primitive and
          medieval ecclesiastical writers. In his two books, Some Remarks
          upon the Ecclesiastical History of the Ancient Churches of
          Piedmont (London, 1690), and Remarks upon the Ecclesiastical
          History of the Ancient Churches of the Albigenses (1692), he
          upheld against Bossuet the view that the Albigenses were not
          dualists, but identical with the Waldenses, and he contributed
          much to the upholding of this erroneous view.

          He studied at Cheshunt College, Hertfordshire, and from Jan.,
          1844, till his death was minister of Union Chapel, Islington,
          London (for the first eight years as associate of the Rev.
          Thomas Lewis). During his ministry the congregation increased to
          a membership of nearly 2,000, and a new church building on
          Compton Terrace, Islington, was opened in Dec., 1877. He was
          chairman of the Congregational Union in 1864 and also in the
          Jubilee Year (1881). He was interested in the musical service of
          public worship and compiled hymn, anthem, and chant books, as
          well as a volume of hymns for children, which were largely used
          in the Congregational churches of England. He wrote much for the
          periodical press, edited the British Quarterly Review, 1865-87,
          and published The Life of Rev. James Sherman (London, 1863).

   All Saints' Day
          ALL SAINTS' DAY (Lat. Festum omnium sanctorum): The first day of
          November. The Greek Church as early as the time of Chrysostom
          consecrated the Sunday after Whitsunday to the memory of all
          martyrs. The underlying idea of this festival is the same as
          that of All Saints' Day, although no connection between the two
          can be shown. The origin of All Saints' Day is obscure. It is
          said that Boniface IV. (608-615) made the Pantheon at Rome a
          church of Mary and all martyrs and that the commemoration of
          this dedication was transferred from May 13 to Nov. 1 (Durand,
          Rationale, vii., chap. 34). More probable is the view that the
          festival is connected with the oratory which Gregory III.
          (731-741) erected in St. Peter's, "in which he laid the bones of
          the holy apostles and of all the holy martyrs and confessors,
          just men made perfect in all the world" (Liber pontificalis,
          Vita Greg. III., ed. Duchesne, i. 417). Traces of the festival
          are found in the Frankish kingdom at the time of the
          Carolingians, it was commended by Alcuin (Epist., lxxv.), and in
          the ninth century it became general. Luther did not approve of
          the festival, and Lutheran and Reformed churches do not observe
          it. The Church of England, however, and its branches retain it.

   All Souls' Day
          ALL SOULS' DAY (Lat. Commemoratio omnium fidelium defunctorum):
          The second day of November. The ancient Church distinguishes
          between the dead who have died for the Church (martyrs) and
          those who, while they have not suffered death for the Church,
          yet have died as believers. All Souls' Day is dedicated to the
          memory of the latter. It is founded on the doctrine of the value
          of prayers and the Eucharist for the dead. Odilo of Cluny (d.
          1049) instituted the festival for the Cluniacs (ASM, sæc. vi.,
          i. 585); and in course of time it was extended to all who had
          died in the faith. The Missale Romanum prescribes a special
          requiem-mass for the day. Luther demanded that the festival be
          given up, and it soon disappeared among Protestants. It is not
          observed in the Church of England. The German rationalists
          favored a commemoration of the dead (cf. G. C. Horst,
          Mysteriosophie, ii., Frankfort, 1817, 432). The litany of the
          Moravians for Easter morning is a Protestant pendant to All
          Souls' Day, and the rapid rise and popularity of the festival
          show that it satisfies a feeling of the Christian mind which the
          Church would do well to recognize.

          ALMAIN, ??l´´mên´, JACQUES: Gallican theologian; b. at Sens c.
          1450; d. in Paris 1515. He was professor of theology in the
          College of Navarre in Paris, and at the request of Louis XII.
          prepared a reply to Cardinal Cajetan's work on the superiority
          of the pope to a general council (Tractatus de auctoritate
          ecclesiæ et conciliorum generalium adversus Thomam de Vio,
          Paris, 1512; See [249]Cajetan, Cardinal). A similar work was his
          Expositio circa decisiones magistri Guilelmi Occam super
          potestate Romani pontificis (1517). He wrote also Moralia (1510)
          and Dictata super sententias magistri Helcot (1512).

          m. e.s.e. of Oporto), Portugal, 1580; d. at Goa 1646. He entered
          the Order of the Jesuits 1595; was sent to the East Indies 1602;
          lived in Abyssinia 1624-34; returned to Goa and became
          provincial of the order in the Indies. He left material for a
          general history of Abyssinia and of the Jesuits there, which was
          edited and published, in Portuguese, with additions, by
          Balthazar Tellez (Coimbra, 1660). Almeida's letter from
          Abyssinia to the general of his order for 1626-27 was published
          in Italian and French (Rome and Paris, 1629).

   Almoner
          ALMONER (Fr. aumônier; Lat. eleemosynarius): An office at the
          French court from the thirteenth century onward, originally
          filled by one of the court chaplains who was entrusted with the
          distribution of the royal alms. Later there were several of
          these almoners, so that from the fifteenth century a grand
          almoner was named. The first to bear this title was Jean de
          Rely, later bishop of Angers and confessor of Charles VII. The
          grand almoner was one of the highest ecclesiastical dignitaries
          in France, and was charged with the supervision of charitable
          works in general, and of the court clergy. Nominations to
          benefices in the king's gift, including bishoprics and abbeys,
          were made through him. The office was abolished with the
          monarchy, though it was revived under both Napoleons.

          Attached to the British court is the Royal Almonry, which
          dispenses alms for the sovereign, with these officers:
          hereditary grand almoner (the marquis of Exeter, lord high
          almoner (the lord bishop of Ely), subalmoner (subdean of chapels
          royal), the groom of the almonry, and the secretary to the lord
          high almoner. In the papal court the almoner of the pope is
          prudent of the elimosineria apostolica, a body composed of two
          clerics and four laymen. There is a similar office at the
          Spanish court.

   Alms
          ALMS: A gift to which the recipient has no claim and for which
          he renders no return, made purely from pity and a desire to
          relieve need. Such a gift has religious value in Buddhism and in
          Islam. But it was in Judaism that almsgiving was first highly
          regarded from a religio-ethical point of view. The Old Testament
          has a higher conception, based upon the ideas that the land
          belongs not to individuals but to God, whence all have equal
          right to its fruits, and that the regulating principle of
          conduct toward others among God's chosen people must be "thou
          shalt love thy neighbor as thyself" (Lev. xix. 18, 34).
          Benevolence follows as an ordinary duty. In postcanonical times
          almsgiving almost imperceptibly assumed the character of a
          voluntary act of merit and even of expiation for sin and
          assurance of salvation (Tobit iv. 7-11, xii. 8-9; Ecclus. iii.
          30, xxix. 12-13). Such overvaluation of external acts is rebuked
          in Matt. vi. The New Testament revelation is a gospel of the
          voluntary love of God, in which good works can have no efficacy
          toward justification and salvation. They are, on the contrary,
          the inevitable result and proof of the renewed life (Matt. vii.
          15-23; Luke x. 33-37). It is from this point of view that the
          idea of a divine reward finds application to the observance of
          charity in the New Testament (Matt. vi. 4, xix. 21; Luke xiv.
          14; Acts x. 4; II Cor. ix. 7; Gal. vi. 9).

          The Judaic conception of almsgiving as an act of merit and
          satisfaction came into the early Church through the Jewish
          Christians. A classic expression of Jewish-Christian thought is
          II Clement xvi. 4: "Almsgiving, therefore, is a good thing, even
          as repentance for sin. Fasting is better than prayer, but
          almsgiving than both. And love covereth a multitude of sins; but
          prayer out of a good conscience delivereth from death. Blessed
          is every man that is found full of these. For almsgiving lifteth
          off the burden of sin." The idea is completely dominant in
          Cyprian (De opere et eleemosynis), and was, indeed, unavoidable,
          if the Old Testament Apocrypha were accepted as on a par with
          the canon. Save that propitiatory value was afterward assigned
          to the sacrament of penance, the position of the Roman Catholic
          Church has remained essentially that of Cyprian. Augustine
          conceded influence in the alleviation of purgatorial suffering
          to almsgiving, and the "Sentences" of Peter Lombard, the
          dogmatic manual of the Middle Ages, emphasize the idea out of
          all true proportion.

          Poverty was so highly prized by the early Church that the
          pseudo-Clementine Homilies (XV. vii. 9) declare the possession
          of property as defilement with the things of this world, a sin.
          In the fourth century poverty, through monasticism, became a
          factor in the Christian ideal life. And in the thirteenth
          century begging, through Francis of Assisi, received a religious
          idealization, which was in the highest degree pernicious to
          social good order. The mendicant monk is nothing more nor less
          than a grossly immoral character. The Reformation rejected all
          these errors, required some form of labor from the Christian as
          the basis of his membership in society, and sought to substitute
          organized care of the poor for the prevalent haphazard methods
          of giving and receiving alms. Protestant dogmatics grants to
          alms no share whatever in the doctrine of salvation. Far above
          any individual instance of almsgiving is the spirit of
          benevolence, which seeks no merit in the gift and aims at
          permanent benefit, not the satisfying of a temporary need.
          Modern humanitarian endeavor and recent legislation, which seek
          to prevent those incapable of work from becoming recipients of
          alms, are but an extension of the principles enunciated by the
          Reformation. Churches should accept the rational principle which
          avoids indiscriminate and unintelligent almsgiving, tending to
          pauperization and the encouragement of idleness. But it is true
          that organization can never fully take the place of personal
          benevolence or render it unnecessary.

   Alogi
          ALOGI, ??l´o-jî (Gk. alogoi): A name coined by Epiphanius
          (Haer., li.) to designate certain people whom he treats as a
          distinct sect. The account which he gives agrees with that of
          Philaster (Haer., lx.), because both depend on the Syntagma of
          Hippolytus. Epiphanius can not have known of them by either oral
          tradition or personal contact; he speaks of them as a phenomenon
          of the past, of the time when Montanism vexed the Church of Asia
          Minor, and is unable to give any answer to the most obvious
          questions in regard to them. Before his time they have no more
          definite name than "the heretics who reject the writings of
          John." Epiphanius was uncertain whether they rejected the
          epistles of John, and Hippolytus had referred only to their
          criticism of the Gospel and the Apocalypse. The former justifies
          the name "Alogi" by the assertion that the sect did not accept
          the Logos proclaimed by John; but the grounds which he quotes
          from them for their rejection of the Johannine writings, equally
          with the indications of Hippolytus and Philaster, fail to
          support this view of their critical attitude; indeed, in another
          place Epiphanius contradicts himself. His consequent association
          of the Theodotians with the Alogi is thus only one of his
          groundless fancies.

          Epiphanius quotes a number of their assertions, e.g., that the
          books in question were written not by John, but by Cerinthus,
          and are unworthy to be received in the Church; that they do not
          agree with the works of the other apostles; and that the
          Apocalypse is absurd in numerous particulars. The determining
          motive of their criticism can not be made out from his
          fragmentary indications. If the name "Alogi" and the notion that
          this motive was a rejection of the Christology of the fourth
          Gospel are demonstrably groundless inventions of Epiphanius,
          which moreover fail to explain the contemptuous tone of the sect
          toward the Apocalypse, it is all the more noteworthy that he not
          only places them in chronological and geographical relation to
          the Montanists of Asia Minor, but attributes to them also a
          denial of the existence of the charismata in the Church. If he
          has here, as a comparison with Irenæus (III. xi. 9) shows,
          repeated confusedly the thoughts of Hippolytus, it follows that
          the latter found in the passage of Irenæus referred to an
          argument against the Alogi, although Irenæus's context only
          requires him to deal with their rejection of the fourth Gospel
          and not of the Apocalypse. Thus it may be taken as the opinion
          of Irenæus and Hippolytus that these other wise orthodox people,
          in their opposition to the Montanists, sought to withdraw from
          the latter the supports which they found for their doctrine of
          the Paraclete in the Gospel of John and for their millenarianism
          in the Apocalypse. The rejection of the Johannine books by the
          Alogi is evidence that these books were generally received;
          their ascription to Cerinthus, a contemporary of John, of the
          belief that they were written in John's life time. This
          ascription need not involve any special reference to the actual
          teaching of Cerinthus, which, according to the more trustworthy
          authority of Irenæus, Hippolytus, and the pseudo-Tertullian
          (Haer., x.), bore no resemblance to that of the apostle.

   Alombrados
          ALOMBRADOS, ??´´lom-br??´dez (modern spelling, ALUMBRADOS; Lat.
          Illuminati; "Enlightened"): Spanish mystics who first attracted
          the attention of the Inquisition in 1524 (Wadding, Annales
          minorum, under the year 1524), when a certain Isabella de Cruce
          of Toledo is mentioned as a representative of their
          quietistic-ascetic teachings and their enthusiastic striving for
          divine inspirations and revelations. About 1546 Magdalena de
          Cruce of Aguilar, near Cordova, a member of the Poor Clares, is
          said to have been accused of spreading immoral antinomian
          teachings and to have been forced to abjure her heresies; and
          there are like reports of a Carmelite nun, Catherina de Jesus of
          Cordova, about 1575, and of a Portuguese Dominican nun, Maria de
          Visitatione, in 1586. The founder of the Society of Jesus, in
          his student days, was accused of belonging to the Illuminati at
          Alcala in 1526, and at Salamanca in 1527, and the second time
          was imprisoned for forty-two days (cf. Gothein, p. 225; see
          [250]Jesuits). A connection between the Spanish Illuminati of
          the sixteenth century and the German reformatory movement has
          often been conjectured, especially by Roman Catholics, but
          without good reason; nor can influence from Anabaptists like
          Münzer or Schwenckfeld be seriously considered.

          An ordinance of the Spanish Inquisition dated Jan. 28, 1558,
          mentions the following heretical teachings as characteristic of
          the Illuminati: "Only inward prayer is well-pleasing to God and
          meritorious, not external prayer with the lips. The confessors
          who impose outward acts of repentance are not to be obeyed; the
          true servants of God are superior to such discipline and have no
          need of meritorious works in the common sense; the contortions,
          convulsions, and faintings, which accompany their inner
          devotion, are to them sufficient tokens of the divine grace. In
          the state of perfection the secret of the Holy Trinity is beheld
          while here below, and all that should be done or left undone is
          communicated directly by the Holy Spirit. When perfection is
          attained it is no longer necessary to look to images of the
          saints, or to hear sermons or religious conversations of the
          common kind" (J. A. Llorente, Geschichte der spanischen
          Inquisition, Germ. ed., ii., Stuttgart, 1824, pp. 3-4). A still
          fuller record of Illuminatic errors is given by Malvasia
          (Catalogus omnium hæresium et conciliorum, Rome, 1661, xvi.
          century, pp. 269-274), who enumerates fifty heretical
          propositions, including besides these already mentioned the
          following: "In the state of perfection the soul can neither go
          forward nor backward, for its own faculties have all been
          abolished by grace. The perfect has no more need of the
          intercession of the saints, even devotion to the humanity of
          Jesus is superfluous for him; he has no more need of the
          sacraments or to do good works. A perfect man can not sin; even
          an act which, outwardly regarded, must be looked upon as
          vicious, can not contaminate the soul which lives in mystical
          union with God."

          The ecclesiastical annalist Spondanus records in the year 1623
          an inquisitorial process against Illuminatic mystics in the
          dioceses of Seville and Granada, in which the grand inquisitor
          Andreas Pacheco mentions no less than seventy-six heretical
          propositions, many of them antinomian. Like things are told of
          the French sect of Illuminés (called also Guérinets from their
          leader the Abbé Guérin) who were prosecuted in 1634 in Flanders
          and Picardy. Another sect of Illuminés which appeared about 1722
          in southern France has more resemblance to the freemasons, and
          seems to have been a precursor of the Order of Illuminati in
          south Germany, especially in Bavaria (see [251]Illuminati).

   Aloysius, Saint, of Gonzaga
          ALOYSIUS, al´´?i´´shius´, SAINT, OF GONZAGA (LUIGI GONZAGA):
          Jesuit; b. in the castle of Castiglione (22 m. n.w. of Mantua),
          the ancestral seat of the Gonzaga family, Mar. 9, 1568; d. in
          Rome June 21, 1591. His father was Marquis of Castiglione and a
          prince of the Holy Roman Empire, but the boy turned away from
          the pleasures of courts and devoted himself early to a life of
          asceticism and piety. In 1585 he renounced his claim to the
          succession in order to join the Society of Jesus, and took the
          vows in 1587. His death was due to his self-sacrificing labors
          in the care of the sick during the prevalence of the plague in
          Rome. He was beatified by Gregory XV. in 1621, and canonized by
          Benedict XIII. in 1726. Devotion to him is wide-spread in the
          modern Roman Catholic Church, in which he is regarded as a model
          of the virtue of purity, and an especial patron of young men,
          particularly those who enter the ecclesiastical state.

   Alpha and Omega
          ALPHA AND OMEGA (A, O): The first and last letters of the Greek
          alphabet. They are used in a symbolic sense in three places in
          the Book of Revelation. In i. 8 God describes himself as "Alpha
          and Omega, the beginning and the ending, which is, and which
          was, and which is to come, the Almighty." The expression is
          similarly used in xxi. 6 (cf. Isa. xliv. 6, xlviii. 12). In
          xxii. 13 the name "Alpha and Omega, the beginning and the end,
          the first and the last" is the designation adopted for himself
          by Christ, who is also called "the first and the last" in ii. 8.
          If, as is apparent from the context, these passages express the
          same symbolic meaning, that of eternity as unlimited duration,
          it is plain that the use of this name is intended to guarantee
          the fulfilment of the prophecies mentioned in the passages.
          Commentators have referred, in explanation of the expression, to
          the use of the first and last letters of the Hebrew alphabet (t
          ') in rabbinical literature, though the parallelism is not
          acknowledged by all scholars. A long line of early and medieval
          writers discuss the passages cited from Revelation. Thus Clement
          of Alexandria has one or more of them in mind when he says
          (Stromata, iv. 25): "For he [the Son] is the circle of all
          powers rolled and united into one unity. Wherefore the Word (Gk.
          Logos) is called the Alpha and the Omega, of whom alone the end
          becomes the beginning, and ends again at the original beginning
          without any break." As in this passage, so in Stromata, vi. 16,
          he explains the prophecies with reference to Christ alone.
          Tertullian (De monogamia, v.) makes a similar use of the name.
          Ambrose (In septem visiones, i. 8) says that Christ calls
          himself the beginning because he is the creator of the human
          race and the author of salvation, and the end because he is the
          end of the law, of death, and so on. Prudentius, in his hymn
          Corde natus ex parentis, paraphrases the words of Revelation.
          The Gnostics extracted from the letters their characteristic
          mystical play on numbers; the fact that A and O stood for 801,
          and the sum of the letters in the Greek word for dove
          (peristera) amounted to the same, was used by the Gnostic Marcus
          to support the assertion that Christ called himself Alpha and
          Omega with reference to the coming of the Spirit at his baptism
          in the form of a dove (Irenæus, I. xiv. 6, xv. 1). Later,
          Primasius played on the numbers in the same way to prove the
          essential identity of the Holy Ghost with the Father and the Son
          (on Rev. xxii. 13). An evidence of the place which these letters
          held in Gnostic speculation is afforded by a piece of parchment
          and one of papyrus preserved in the Egyptian Museum at Berlin,
          both originally used as amulets. On the former the letters are
          found together with Coptic magical formulas and a cross of St.
          Andrew; the latter also contains Coptic formulas, divided by a
          cross which terminates at each extremity in A or O.

          The letters occur much less frequently in the literary sources
          of Christian antiquity and of the Middle Ages than in monumental
          inscriptions. With the various forms of the monogram of Christ
          and of the cross, they belonged to the most popular symbols of
          early Christian art, which was never tired of reproducing them
          on all kinds of monuments, public and private, and in every sort
          of material. The fact that with but very few exceptions, A and O
          are found, as far as is known, on these monuments in connection
          with figures or symbols of Christ--never of God in the abstract
          or of God the Father--leads to the interesting conclusion that
          the popular exegesis of the above-named passages of the
          Apocalypse referred their meaning to Christ alone, and thus
          affords a proof that the makers of these monuments were
          indirectly expressing their belief in his divinity. The
          possibility, however, can not be denied that in certain cases
          motives of a superstitious nature may have led to the employment
          of these symbols; but it is much less easy to reason with
          certainty from the monumental remains than from the literature
          of the time. Modern Christian art, less given to symbolism, is
          relatively poor in examples of the use of these letters, though
          they have reappeared more often in the nineteenth century, as a
          general rule in connection with the monogram of Christ. Full and
          detailed descriptions of their early use, with the dates of
          their appearance in different countries, and classification of
          their employment alone, with human or animal figures, or (which
          is much more frequent) with other symbols, may be found in
          abundance in the archeological works of De Rossi, Garrucci,
          Hübner, Le Blant, Kraus, and others, and in the Corpus
          inscriptionum Latinarum.

   Alphæus
          ALPHÆUS, al-fî´us: Father of the second James in all four of the
          lists of the apostles. He is interesting in so far as he may
          with probability be identified with the Clopas (A. V. Cleophas)
          of John xix. 25. Of the two Marys who stood by the cross with
          the mother of Jesus, one is called in this passage the wife of
          Clopas; in Matt. xxvii. 56 and in Mark xv. 40, the mother of
          James, or James the Less, presumably the second apostle of this
          name. The question how the use of two different names, Alphæus
          and Clopas, is to be explained may be answered in two ways.
          Either Klopas (= Kleopas, a contraction of Kleopatros, as
          Antipas of Antipatros) was the Greek name which Alphæus bore in
          addition to his Aramaic one; or there are here two alternative
          Grecized forms, both representing chlpy. Against the former view
          is the fact that the contraction klo for kleo in Greek names is
          never found elsewhere; and in favor of the latter is the fact
          that the initial ch, commonly rendered by the smooth breathing
          or by X, is sometimes also represented by K. In any case the
          diversity of names need not prevent the identity of person. This
          identity would make Alphæus the uncle, and James, the son of
          Alphæus, the cousin, of Jesus--a result of some importance for
          the question as to [252]James.

          (K. Schmidt).

          The most probable solution of this much vexed problem seems to
          lie in a ground form lphy, the two modes of pronouncing the
          first letter of which (as in Arabic) would give rise to the
          variant names Alphæus and Clopas or Cleophas.

   Alsace-Lorraine
          ALSACE-LORRAINE (Germ. Elsass-Lothringen): An immediate
          "imperial territory" (Reichsland), forming the extreme southwest
          of the German empire, bounded on the north by the grand duchy of
          Luxemburg, Rhenish Prussia, and the Rhine Palatinate (Rhenish
          Bavaria), on the east by Baden, on the south by Switzerland, and
          on the west by France. Its area is 5,603 square miles, with a
          population (1905) of 1,814,630, including 1,375,300 (75.8 per
          cent.) Roman Catholics, 406,100 (22.3 per cent.) Protestants,
          and 33,130 (1.88 per cent.) Jews. The preponderance of Roman
          Catholics points back to the political conditions of the
          sixteenth century, when the territory for the most part belonged
          to the house of Austria, the duke of Lorraine, and the bishops
          of Strasburg. The Reformation found entrance only in the free
          city of Strasburg and in certain other cities and minor
          dependencies; and much of the progress there made was lost under
          the dragonnades and through the work of the Jesuits in the time
          of Louis XIV.

  The Lutheran Church.

          Ecclesiastical matters were little changed by the transfer of
          Alsace-Lorraine from France to Germany after the war of 1870-71.
          The Church of the Augsburg Confession is still constituted
          according to the law of the first French republic as amended in
          1852 after the coup d'état of Louis Napoleon. A presbyterial
          council, chosen by the congregation, under the presidency of the
          pastor, has general oversight of the spiritual and temporal
          concerns of each congregation. Its acts and decisions must be
          confirmed by the next higher ecclesiastical board, the
          consistory--in some cases representing a single congregation, in
          others a union of several--which is chosen by a highly
          complicated system. Its functions are in general the same as
          those of the presbytery--to maintain discipline, to care for the
          order of divine service, and to manage Church property. There
          are also inspection districts, each having one clerical and two
          lay inspectors. At the head of the Church is a directory, a
          standing board, and an upper consistory, which meets yearly. The
          directory consists of two laymen and one of the clerical
          inspectors appointed by the government, and two lay members
          chosen by the upper consistory. It has power to review all acts
          of presbyteries and consistories, manages all Church property,
          forms the intermediate body between Church and government, and
          appoints all ministers after consultation with presbyterial
          councils and consistories. It has a voice in appointing the
          teachers of the Protestant gymnasium, has the right of
          nominating the inspectors, licenses and ordains preachers, and
          executes the decrees of the upper consistory. The latter meets
          annually in regular session. The business to be brought before
          it must have the approval of the government and its decisions
          require government confirmation. Its sessions are limited to six
          days and a representative of the government must be present.
          Ministers' salaries range between 1,420 and 2,840 marks
          according to position and length of service. The most important
          foundations are under the administration of the Chapter of St.
          Thomas in Strasburg; they are partly ecclesiastical, partly
          educational, the latter being the more important.

  Reformed and Other Bodies.

          The Reformed Church of Alsace-Lorraine has substantially the
          same constitution as the Church of the Augsburg Confession. Its
          congregations are led and governed by similar presbyterial
          councils and consistories, but the latter are not united into an
          external administrative unity. It has a numerical strength about
          one-fifth that of the Lutheran Church. Of other Protestant
          bodies the Mennonites, with a membership of about 2,500, are the
          strongest. The government expenditures for salaries and other
          Church purposes are more than 700,000 marks yearly.

  The Roman Catholic Church.

          The Roman Catholic Church of Alsace-Lorraine comprises the two
          bishoprics of Strasburg (Alsace) and Metz (Lorraine), formerly
          belonging to the province of Besançon, but since 1874
          independent of all archiepiscopal or metropolitan jurisdiction.
          The bishops are named by the reigning prince, and receive
          canonical institution from Rome. They select all books to be
          used in church services, and present priests for appointment to
          the prince, but name directly the lower clergy as well as the
          directors and professors of the diocesan seminaries, in which
          the clergy receive their training. They also direct these
          seminaries and order the instruction in them. Each bishop has
          two vicars-general and a chapter, which becomes influential only
          in the case of a vacancy in the bishopric. The salaries of
          priests range from 1,500 to 2,000 marks; vicars receive 540
          marks. Church buildings and rectories by law belong to the civil
          authorities so that the latter are charged with their
          maintenance, of the ordinary revenues (managed by a committee of
          the congregation) do not suffice. Such buildings may not be
          diverted from their original purpose. Many of the churches are
          used by both Protestants and Roman Catholics. The cemeteries
          also are common property, and any resident may be buried in them
          without confessional distinction. The taking of monastic vows
          for life is forbidden, and the law recognizes no religious
          order; nevertheless, more than twenty are represented, the
          greater number being for females. The expenditures of the State
          for the Roman Catholic Church amount to more than 2,000,000
          marks yearly.

          The Jews are divided into three consistories, each with a chief
          rabbi, at Strasburg, Colmar, and Metz, respectively. Rabbis
          receive salaries from the State, varying from 1,500 to 1,900
          marks.

   Alsted, Johann Heinrich
          ALSTED, ??l´sted, JOHANN HEINRICH: Reformed theologian; b. at
          Ballersbach, near Herborn (43 m. n. of Wiesbaden), Nassau, 1588;
          d. at Weissenburg (Karlsburg, 240 m. e.s.e. of Budapest),
          Siebenbürgen, Hungary, Nov. 8, 1638. He studied at Herborn and
          became professor there in the philosophical faculty in 1610, and
          in the theological faculty in 1619. In 1629 he went to the newly
          founded University of Weissenburg. He represented the Church of
          Nassau at the Synod of Dort (1618-19). He was one of the famous
          teachers of his time, and compiled a series of compends of
          pretty nearly every branch of knowledge, which are interesting
          as showing the scholarly and literary methods and achievements
          of the seventeenth century. The most remarkable were Cursus
          philosophici encyclopædia (Herborn, 1620) and Encyclopædia
          septem tomis distincta (ib. 1630). The first of these comprises
          two volumes; one a quarto of 3,072 pages, containing: i.,
          quatuor præcognita philosophica: archelogia, hexilogia,

I. In Primitive Religion:

  1. Altar not Necessarily a Raised Structure.

          The word "altar," derived ultimately from the Latin alere, "to
          nourish," through altus, derived meaning "high," is usually
          taken to mean a raised structure; but etymology and history are
          against this. "Altar" is the rendering in the Old Testament of
          mizbeah (Aram. madhbah), "place of sacrifice," and in the New
          Testament of thusiasterion, having the same meaning. The Greek
          word bOmos indeed means a raised structure; but the possession
          of two words by the Greek suggests development and
          differentiation. The Latin ara means the seat or resting-place,
          not "of the victim" (so Andrews, Latin Lexicon, s.v.), but of
          the deity; and on that account the word was avoided by the
          Fathers. The word "altar" has its ultimate root in the actual
          purport of the early [253]sacrifice, viz., a meal of worshipers
          and worshiped. So far from the place of sacrifice being
          invariably a raised structure, it was sometimes a trench (e.g.,
          in the celebrated sacrifice of Ulysses described in Odyssey,
          xi.), while in the famous tombs at Mycenæ there were depressions
          connected by small shafts with the graves, and generally
          explained as the places of deposit of offerings to the dead. At
          the present day the African places his offering of oil to the
          tree spirit not on an altar, but on the ground.

          To understand the development of the altar it must be recalled
          that, as is generally conceded, religion has passed through the
          animistic stage. That is to say, man in his primitive state
          might regard any object--tree, rock, mountain, fountain, stream,
          sea, etc.--as the seat of divine power. His mental processes
          then led him to approach whatever he regarded as divinity as he
          approached human superiors, namely with gifts, which he applied
          directly to the objects of his worship, casting his offerings
          into fountain, stream, sea, or fire, laying them at the foot or
          on the top of the mountain, or smearing oil or fat, or pouring
          blood or wine on the divine stone. In other words, these objects
          were both divinity and altar.

  2. Altar and Divinity One.

          The best Biblical example of this primitive mode of thinking and
          acting is in the passage Gen. xxviii. 11-18. Jacob had pillowed
          his head on a stone, and there resulted his dream of the ladder.
          In accordance with the mental processes of his time, on
          awakening he conceived the cause of this dream to be the
          divinity in (or of) the stone--note his exclamation, "this is a
          Bethel" (a "place or house of God")--and he "poured oil upon the
          stone." In this he paralleled the custom of the pre-Mohammedan
          Arabs, as proved by W. R. Smith (Rel. of Sem., Lecture v.) and
          Wellhausen (Heidentum, pp. 99 sqq.). The passages referred to in
          these two authors demonstrate that such a stone was more than an
          altar; it was the visible embodiment of the presence of deity.
          The same might be shown in the customs of other peoples, as for
          example, the Samoans (cf. Turner, Samoa, London, 1884, pp. 24,
          281). This anointing of sacred stones is a custom followed by
          the Samoyeds to this day, and was known in Russia and in the
          west of Ireland in the early part of the last century. The
          custom is entirely on a par with the superstitious practise,
          only recently abandoned, in remote parts of Wales and Cornwall,
          of putting pins and other trifles in wells and springs reputed
          to have healing qualities, doubtless in pagan times the seat of
          worship (cf. Folk-Lore, in which many examples are given). The
          Greek and Roman custom of pouring a libation to Neptune into the
          sea at the beginning of a voyage will occur to the reader as a
          survival from the time when the sea was a deity and not merely
          the domain of one.

          The stone (in the Old Testament the word is often rendered
          "[254]pillar,") and cairn "or witness" (Gen. xxxi. 45-54; cf.
          Josh. xxiv. 26-27 with xxii. 26-27) were almost certainly such
          embodiments of the presence of deity (note the words, Gen. xxxi.
          52, "This heap be witness and this pillar [stone] be witness,"
          and, in Josh., "It [this stone] hath heard"); the covenant and
          oath were under the protection of the deity there present (cf.
          Baal-berith = "Baal [protector] of the covenant," Judges viii.
          33, and El-berith = "God [protector] of the covenant," Josh. ix.
          46, R. V., and the Greek Zeus orkios = "Zeus [protector] of the
          oath"). In the Genesis passage the covenant-making feast, at
          which the clan and the deity were commensals, followed the
          appeal to the covenant-guarding object. And while the fact is
          not expressly stated, that the pillar of Jacob and Laban was
          anointed hardly admits of question, in view of the custom
          attending the holding of such a feast-sacrifice. At least in
          early times, then, the same object was sometimes both divinity
          and altar.

  3. Altar and Divinity Differentiated.

          The next step shows the differentiation between the two. The
          later Arabic term for altar is nu?b from the same root as the
          Hebrew ma??ebah ("pillar"). It has been shown by W. R. Smith and
          Wellhausen in the works already cited that the an?ab (pl. of
          nu?b) were stones, the objects of worship, and later merely
          altars. This shows a development in conception. A similar
          unfolding took place in Hebrew practise (see [255]II., below),
          where stones are shown to have been used as altars. But often
          among the Hebrews the stone pillar was retained, an altar was
          erected, and the two stood side by side (Hos. iii. 4; Isa. xix.
          19). Then the pillars came to be more or less ornate (cf. the
          Greek Hermæ and the two pillars in Solomon's Temple, I Kings
          vii. 15-22, which last are hard to explain except as a
          transference to the Temple of the pillars customary at shrines).
          That the ma??ebah represented deity is now generally granted.
          The old custom of applying the sacrifice to the monolith had
          become outworn; it was no longer deity but only deity's
          representative, and the altar was provided on which to place
          (or, in the case of fire-sacrifices, to consume) the offerings.

          That the altars were rude at first, and that the elaborate ones
          of later times were the product of developed esthetic
          perceptions, is as clear from archeological investigations as is
          the development of the house and temple from the simple cave or
          booth dwellings, and of the elaborate ritual from the simple
          worship of primitive ages.

          The location of altars is implicitly indicated in the foregoing.
          Wherever deity indicated its presence either by some such
          subjective manifestation as a dream, or by terrestrial phenomena
          such as the issue of a fountain or of subterranean gases, or by
          such supposed interference in the sphere of human events as by a
          storm which changed the fortune of battle, or by aerial
          phenomena such as the formation of thunder-claps with resultant
          lightning on the crest of a mountain--thither men brought their
          offerings and there altars were found or placed. Naturally the
          tops of hills (see [256]High Places) and groves were universally
          adopted; and these passed from early to late possessors of the
          lands as sacred places. The one test was the supposed residence
          or frequent attendance of deity at the spot.

II. In the Old Testament:

  1. Pre-Deuteronomic and Deuteronomic.

          The altars of the oldest code were of earth, and therefore
          simple mounds, or of unhewn stones (Ex. xx. 24). (Were the two
          mules' burden of earth, II Kings v. 17, for an altar ?)
          Sometimes a single boulder or monolith sufficed (Josh. xxiv.
          26-27; cf. xxii. 26-27; Judges vi. 20; I Sam. vi. 14, xiv. 33; I
          Kings i. 9). For the cairn as an altar, note Gen. xxxi. 45-54,
          and cf. xxviii. 18. As late as the Deuteronomic code (Deut.
          xxvii. 5) undressed stone is specified as the material for the
          altar, and the height of the altar is limited. The elaboration
          in form and material of the altars of Solomon (I Kings viii. 64)
          and of Ahaz (II Kings xvi. 10-11) are directly traceable to
          contact with outside culture and the development of esthetic
          perception and desire (see [257]Art, Hebrew). The locations
          correspond closely with primitive usage and with the fact that
          early Hebrew worship was in large part derived from or coalesced
          with Canaanitic practise. "High places," i.e., the tops of
          hills, were especially used, and there are several traces of
          tree and fountain altars, e.g., the Paneas source of the Jordan
          and the Fountain of Mary near Jerusalem.

  2. Post-Deuteronomic.

          Post-Deuteronomic means exilic or postexilic and the history of
          the Hebrew altar is bound up with that of the Temple. The
          effects of contact with advanced culture are shown in the
          elaborated structure and equipment, while the differentiation of
          the altar of burnt offering and that of incense tells the story
          of advancing elaboration of cult. The "table of showbread" was
          in form and purpose an altar.

          Geo. W. Gilmore.

III. In the Christian Church:

          The oldest designation of the place of celebration of the
          "Lord's Supper" is "the Lord's table" (Gk. trapeza kuriou, I
          Cor. x. 21). This expression or "table" alone or with an
          adjective ("holy, sacred, mystic table;" trapeza hiera, hagia,
          mystike, etc.) is used by the Greek Fathers. The general Greek
          word for altar (thysiasterion) is less frequently used and bOmos
          is purposely avoided. The Latin writers use mensa, altare,
          altarium, but show repugnance to ara.

1. Before the Reformation:

  a. To about the Year 1000:

    1. Form and Structure.

          As the oldest meeting-places of Christian worship, rooms in
          ordinary dwellings, differed essentially from the Jewish
          sanctuary in Jerusalem and from the temples of the Greeks and
          Romans, so also the "table of the Lord" differed from the Jewish
          and heathen altars; and it is significant that the absence of
          altars in the Christian service was especially offensive to the
          heathen (Minucius Felix, Octavius, 10; Origen, contra Celsum,
          vii. 64, viii. 17; Cyprian, Ad Demetrianum, 12). The celebration
          of the agape and the Eucharist required a table, and it was but
          natural that the first disciples of the Lord, like himself,
          should celebrate the sacred meal about and on a table. When the
          religious service was transferred from private houses to special
          buildings, the exclusive use of tables for the celebration of
          the Eucharist was still continued. The frequent notices that the
          persecuted sought and found a safe hiding-place beneath the
          altar or embraced the legs of the altar as a sign of their
          distress (cf. Schmid, pp. 31-32, 69-70), as well as notices in
          Gregory of Tours (Miraculorum libri vii., i. 28) and Paulus
          Silentiarius (Descriptio ecclesiæ S. Sophiæ, pp. 752 sqq.), that
          the altars in St. Peter's at Rome and in St. Sophia at
          Constantinople were supported by columns, presuppose the
          table-form of the altar. The recollection of this original form
          has never been lost in the Church, and to this day the
          table-altar is the rule in the Greek Church.

          When relics first began to be transferred from their original
          resting-places to churches, their receptacles were placed
          beneath the altar--seldom before or behind it, and not until the
          Middle Ages above it. The space was then sometimes walled up,
          giving the altar a coffin- or chest-like form. Such altars are
          found here and there as early as the fifth century, and during
          the Middle Ages they became usual. The terms martyrium and
          confessio were applied to such tombs as well as to the
          crypt-like space which held the coffin (arca), to the coffin
          itself, and to the altar. To make it possible to see and touch
          the holy contents an opening (fenestrella) was left in front
          with a lattice of metal or marble (transenna) or two doors
          (regiolæ). It must not be assumed that all altars of the Middle
          Ages were provided with relics. A canopy (ciborium), supported
          by pillars, was frequently found as early as the time of
          Constantine. The material used was wood, stone, and metal; gold,
          silver, and precious stones were sometimes employed.

    2. Accessories and Ornamentation.

          It was usual in antiquity to spread a table with a cloth in
          preparation for a banquet, and this custom was transferred to
          "the table of the Lord." Optatus of Mileve in the second half of
          the fourth century is the first to mention such a covering (De
          schismate Donatistorum, vi. 1, 5). Thenceforth altar-cloths are
          more frequently mentioned. Their size can not be determined.
          They seem to have been generally of linen, though other
          materials, as silk and gold-brocade, were used. Only one such
          covering was used at first, later the number varied. To this
          period belongs the corporale (called also palla corporalis,
          oportorium dominici corporis, Gk. sindOn), in which the bread
          intended for the oblation was wrapped (Isidore of Pelusium,
          Epist., i. 123). Later there were two corporalia (or pallæ): one
          spread over the altar- cloths, on which the holy vessels stood;
          the other used to cover the cup and the paten. In time the name
          corporale was restricted to the first of these, and palla was
          used for the second. Both were of linen. Among the most
          elaborate and costly of altar-appendages in the Romanesque
          period were the antependia or frontalia, which were used as
          decorations for the altar-front; the back and the sides of the
          altar also were often adorned in like manner. When altars of
          gold and silver are mentioned it is probable that in most cases
          metal plates in the front of the altar are meant. The oldest
          specimens which have been preserved date from the ninth to the
          twelfth centuries. They represent scenes from Bible history and
          the lives of saints, usually with the figure of Christ in the
          center. Precious stones and glass are inserted. Antependia were
          also made of costly cloths with gold and silver embroidery, and
          mosaics and reliefs were built into the sides of the altar.
          Crosses are represented in these decorations, and stood near
          altars; they were also placed above or hung below the ciborium,
          but in the first millennium crucifixes did not stand on the
          altars. In like manner lamps were hung from the ciboria or stood
          about the altars, but not on them.

    3. Number and Varieties of Altars.

          At first there was only one altar in the place of worship,
          symbolic of unity. In a basilica without transepts it stood at
          the center of the chord of the apse. The Eastern Church retained
          the single altar; but in the West the number increased under the
          influence of the custom of private masses and the veneration of
          relics. A church in Gaul in the time of Gregory the Great (d.
          604) had thirteen; the cathedral at Magdeburg, forty-eight.
          After the year 1000 altars received different names according to
          their position and use. The main altar was called the altare
          majus, capitaneum, cardinale, magistrum, or principale, "high
          altar"; the others were altaria minora. After Alexander VI.
          began to grant special indulgences at certain altars the term
          altare privilegiatum came into use; a mass for the dead read at
          such an altar brought plenary indulgence. Abbey-churches had an
          altar dedicated to the holy cross (altare sanctæ crucis), placed
          between the choir and the nave, and intended for the lay
          brothers. Portable altars (altaria viatica, portabilia,
          itineraria, gestatoria, motoria) are mentioned from the seventh
          century; they were used by missionaries, prelates, and princes
          on journeys.

  b. From the Year 1000 to 1800:

          The increasing veneration which was paid to relics led early in
          this period to a desire to place holy remains on the altar--not
          beneath it or near it as had been done previously. In the
          thirteenth century, relics on the altar were a part of its
          regular equipment. When the entire body of a saint was removed
          from its original resting-place some special provision for its
          shrine had to be made, and this led to an extension of the altar
          at the rear (retabulum). Wood or stone was used, and decorations
          similar to those of altars were provided. In some instances such
          retabula took the place of the canopies; where the latter were
          retained they began to be made in two stories, the relic-case
          being put in the upper one. Many such cases have been preserved;
          they are made of copper, silver, gold, and ivory, and are
          ornamented with enamel, filigree-work, and gems. Altars were
          surrounded with columns connected by cross-bars from which
          curtains hung. Railings fencing off the altar were known to the
          earlier time, but were not general. They became more common with
          the growing distinction between clergy and laity, and as the
          number of the clergy increased, the size of the chancel became
          greater. From the thirteenth century, crosses, crucifixes, and
          candles appear on the altar. The position of the cross and the
          lights was not fixed, and the latter numbered one or two, seldom
          more. Other articles which belonged to the altar furniture were
          gospel-books, often in costly binding, flabella, little bells,
          and thuribles.

  c. From 1800 to the Reformation:

          The ciborium altar lasted through the period of Romanesque art
          and even defied the influence of the Gothic. In France the
          retabulum was retained till toward 1400, but in Germany before
          that time it gave way to higher structures built upon the altar.
          The tendency to regard such additions as mere receptacles for
          the relic-cases disappeared. The holy remains were again placed
          within the altar, or, if retained upon it, filled only a
          subordinate part. Wood came to be more generally used as
          material. Doors were provided for the shrine. Later both shrine
          and doors were set upon a pedestal (predella), which after 1475
          became an integral part of the altar. The earlier altars of this
          period hold rigidly to the Gothic style, but later more freedom
          is apparent. Carving, sculpture, reliefs, and painting were
          freely used as decoration.

2. Since the Reformation:

  1. Lutheran and Reformed Churches.

          The Reformed Churches undertook to remove all accessories of
          medieval worship, including the altar, for which they
          substituted a simple table. The Lutheran churches, however,
          aiming merely to do away with that which was contrary to
          Scripture, opposed only the conception of the "table of the
          Lord" as a sacrificial altar. The secondary altars were no
          longer used, but were not always removed from the churches. The
          high altar was generally reserved for the celebration of the
          Lord's Supper, the relic-cases with the monstrance and host
          being removed, and the decorations with the crucifixes and
          lights, and the antependia and the like being retained. The
          relics beneath the altar were sometimes merely covered over, not
          disturbed. New altars built for evangelical churches during the
          first half of the sixteenth century followed the general plan
          and structure of those already existing. In the paintings Bible
          scenes or events of the Reformation took the place of incidents
          in saints' lives. Portraits of founders and their families were
          introduced. The general form and structure were made subordinate
          to the paintings, but in the latter half of the century the
          architectural features sometimes obscured the paintings. During
          the baroco period altars and all church furniture shared in the
          generally depraved taste of the time. From the middle of the
          seventeenth century the pulpit began to be placed behind the
          altar, and elevated above it, and then the organ and choir were
          placed above the pulpit. The result was to dwarf and degrade the
          altar, and the tasteless pictures and other decorations of the
          time do not diminish the displeasing effect. The nineteenth
          century brought a return to the early Christian and Gothic
          forms. The altars of the latest time are marked by eclecticism
          and by a striving after novelty which often mixes discrepant
          elements.

          (Nikolaus Müller).

  2. The Church of England.

          In the Church of England, after the Reformation much stress was
          laid by many Reformers on bringing the altar down into the body
          of the church and designating it as the "Holy Table," the name
          which it nearly always bears in the Prayer-book. By the
          eighteenth century it had usually assumed the shape of a small
          table, frequently concealed from sight by the immense structure
          of pulpit and reading-desk in front of it; but with the
          Tractarian and Ritualist movements of the nineteenth century and
          the increasing frequency and reverence of the celebration of the
          Eucharist, it gradually resumed its former shape and dignity. In
          the American Episcopal Church this change was productive of
          bitter controversy, and about 1850 the retention of a table with
          legs was considered a sign of unimpeachable Protestant
          orthodoxy.

   Altar-bread
          ALTAR-BREAD: The bread used in the Roman Catholic and Greek
          churches in the Sacrament of the Eucharist. It is made from pure
          wheaten flour, mixed with water, and baked, all conditions being
          regulated by strict law. The Council of Florence, to meet the
          contention of Michael Cærularius that the Latins did not possess
          the Eucharist because of their use of unfermented bread, defined
          that either kind may be validly employed. Nevertheless, it is
          unlawful today for a Latin priest to use fermented, or for a
          Greek priest, except in the Armenian and Maronite rites, to use
          unfermented bread. The practise of the Greeks has always been
          the same, but in the Western Church both fermented and
          unfermented bread were employed down to the ninth century. The
          altar-bread is also called a host, because of the victim whom
          the sacramental species are destined to conceal. In the Latin
          Church the host is circular in form, bearing an image of the
          crucifixion or the letters I. H. S., and is of two sizes; the
          larger is consumed by the celebrant or preserved for solemn
          exposition, and the smaller given to the people in communion.
          The name "particles" given to the smaller hosts recalls the fact
          that down to the eleventh century communion was distributed to
          the faithful by breaking off portions of a large bread
          consecrated by the celebrant. The large host of the Greeks is
          rectangular in shape, and the small host triangular. Great care
          is taken in the preparation of altar-breads, many synodal
          enactments providing that it shall be committed only to clerics
          or to women in religious communities.

   Altar-cards
          ALTAR-CARDS: Three cards, containing certain prayers of the
          mass, placed on the altar in Roman Catholic churches, the
          central card being larger than those placed at either end. Their
          introduction dates from the sixteenth century, when the middle
          card began to be employed as an aid to the memory of the
          celebrant and to relieve him from the necessity of continually
          referring to the missal. When the reading of the beginning of
          St. John's Gospel was prescribed, the card on the Gospel side
          was added, and later, to make the arrangement appear
          symmetrical, the third card came into use. In masses celebrated
          by a bishop, the practise anterior to the sixteenth century is
          maintained by the substitution of a book called the canon, from
          which are read the prayers usually printed on altar-cards. Since
          most of these prayers are to be said secretly or inaudibly,
          altar-cards are sometimes called secret-cards.

   Altenstein, Karl Freiherr von Stein Zum
          ALTENSTEIN, ??l´´ten-st?in´, KARL FREIHERR VON STEIN ZUM: German
          statesman, first minister of public worship in Prussia
          (1817-40); b. at Ansbach (20 m. w.s.w. of Nuremberg), Bavaria,
          Oct. 1, 1770; d. in Berlin May 14, 1840. He lost his father at
          the age of nine, and to the fact that his character was formed
          under the influence of his mother has been attributed his
          incapacity in after-life for making thoroughgoing and clear-cut
          decisions. He was educated in his birthplace and at the
          universities of Erlangen and Göttingen, where he studied law
          primarily, but found plenty of time for researches in
          philosophy, especially the philosophy of religion, and the
          natural sciences. In 1793 he received a minor legal appointment
          at Ansbach, which in the mean time had become Prussian. Here he
          was under Hardenberg, who recognized his ability and had him
          transferred to Berlin in 1799. At the capital he gained the
          reputation of an authority in financial matters, and was made a
          privy councilor in the financial department in 1803, succeeding
          Stein as minister of finance in 1808. Unable to cope with the
          almost impossible task of satisfying the demands of Napoleon, he
          retired in 1810. Hardenberg, who had been compelled to join in
          overthrowing him, tried three years later to bring him back to
          public life, and in 1817 secured his appointment as head of the
          newly founded ministry of public worship, education, and
          medicine. These important branches of public administration had
          until then formed departments of the ministry of the interior,
          and had been badly managed.

          Altenstein took up religious questions as a man who understood
          and cared for them, though his Christianity had a decidedly
          rationalistic tinge. Difficulties of many kinds beset him during
          his long tenure of office, arising partly from the determined
          and obstinate character of his sovereign and partly from
          demagogic opposition, as well as from the great Halle
          controversy of 1830 and from the vexed question of the Catholic
          attitude in regard to mixed marriages. When, in 1824, without
          his knowledge, the direction of education was taken from
          Nicolovius and given to Von Kamptz, Altenstein was on the verge
          of resigning his post, but he decided that it was his duty to
          remain. One of the great achievements of his administration was
          the systematic improvement to a remarkable extent of primary and
          secondary education.

   Althamer, Andreas
          ALTHAMER, ??l´th??m´´er, ANDREAS (sometimes known by the Greek
          form of his name, Palaiosphyra): German Reformer; b. in the
          village of Brenz, near Gundelfingen (28 m. n.w. of Augsburg),
          Württemberg, c. 1500; d. at Ansbach, probably in 1519. He
          studied at Leipsic and Tübingen. In 1524 he is found settled as
          priest at Gmünd in Swabia, where he was the leader of the
          evangelical party, and he remained there after he had been
          deposed and had married. He escaped with difficulty in the
          reaction of the Swabian League, and fled to Wittenberg,
          remaining there nine months and proceeding to Nuremberg in the
          summer of 1526. His Lutheran convictions were now mature, and he
          maintained a constant literary activity against both the
          Zwinglians and the Roman Catholics. He was pastor at Eltersdorf,
          near Erlangen, in 1527, deacon at St. Sebaldus's, Nuremberg, in
          1528; he took part as an ardent Lutheran in the disputation at
          Bern, and in the same year was called to Ansbach to assist in
          spreading the Reformation in Brandenburg. In November he
          published a complete catechism, remarkable not only for the
          clearness and precision of its teaching, but also as being the
          first work of the kind to take the title of catechism. For the
          next few years he was the soul of the Protestant party in that
          part of Germany, and by his untiring energy and gifts of
          organization did much in the development there of the
          evangelical religion. Of his theological works may be mentioned
          his Annotationes in Jacobi Epistolam (Strasburg, 1527), which
          carried still further Luther's views of that epistle, though it
          was modified in the edition of 1533. His notes on the Germania
          of Tacitus, published in complete form 1536, have preserved his
          fame as a classical scholar even where the Reformer has been
          forgotten.

          and systematic theology at the University of Göttingen, becoming
          full professor two years later. He has written Die historische

          Groningen (92 m. n.e. of Amsterdam) Aug. 25, 1644. He studied at
          Groningen and Herborn, acted as tutor for several German
          princes, and traveled as far as England. In 1613 he became
          professor of dogmatics at Heidelberg, and in 1616 director of
          the seminary in the Collegium Sapientiæ. Leaving Heidelberg
          because of the disturbances of the Thirty Years' war, he went to
          Holland, and in 1627 was appointed professor at Groningen. He
          was one of the delegates from the Palatinate to the Synod of
          Dort (1618-19) and was a decided but Biblical predestinarian. He
          collaborated on the Dutch Bible version. He published nothing
          during his lifetime; after his death his son, Jacob Alting (b.
          at Heidelberg 1618; d. at Groningen, where he was professor of
          Hebrew, 1679) published several of his works, the most
          noteworthy being the Theologia historica (Amsterdam, 1664), a
          pioneer work on the history of doctrine.

   Altmann
          ALTMANN, ??lt´m??n: Bishop of Passau 1065-91; d. at Zeiselmauer
          (12 m. n.w. of Vienna), Lower Austria, Aug. 8, 1091. A
          Westphalian of noble birth, he became first a student and then
          head of the school of Paderborn. Later he was provost of Aachen,
          then chaplain to Henry III., after whose death he was attached
          to the household of the Empress Agnes. In 1064 he made the
          pilgrimage to Jerusalem, and was chosen bishop of Passau before
          his return. He adhered steadfastly to Gregory VII. in his
          conflict with Henry IV., and was the first of the German bishops
          to proclaim against the king the sentence of excommunication
          which had been pronounced in Rome. He allied himself with the
          South German princes, and acted as papal legate in the
          assemblies at Ulm and Tribur in the autumn of 1076. Rudolf of
          Swabia had no more faithful partizan. As a result of this
          attitude, Altmann had to leave his diocese, which suffered
          severely (1077-78) from Henry's resentment. He went to Rome
          early in 1079, and was there when Gregory VII. hurled a second
          anathema at Henry in the synod of 1080. He returned to Germany
          as permanent papal vicar. Under his influence Liutpold of
          Austria broke with Henry, and Altmann was able to return to
          Passau. After Rudolf's death (Oct. 15, 1080), he was entrusted
          with the pope's instructions with regard to the setting up of a
          new contestant for the throne, and Hermann of Luxemburg was
          chosen (Aug., 1081). Altmann does not appear as leader of the
          papal party in Germany after Liutpold's defeat by the Bohemians
          at Mailberg in 1082. He maintained himself for a while in the
          eastern part of his diocese, Passau itself being held by an
          opposition bishop, and rejected all compromise. In the internal
          administration of his diocese his policy was vigorously
          Hildebrandine.

          ALUMNATE: A term used to denote the position of a student in an
          episcopal or papal seminary. In order to enter such an
          institution the candidate must be capable of receiving orders
          and have the express intention of taking them. The seminarist
          receives the privileges of the clerical state as soon as he is
          tonsured, even before ordination. The alumni of the seminaries
          and colleges for the training of missionaries have special
          privileges, on condition that when they enter the college they
          solemnly swear not to join any religious order, but as secular
          priests to devote their whole lives to missionary work, under
          the general direction of the Propaganda, to which they are
          required to make annual reports.

   Alvar of Cordova
          ALVAR OF CORDOVA (called also Paul Alvar): Spanish Christian
          champion against the Mohammedans; b. about 800; d. about 861.
          His ancestors appear to have been Jews, and his family was
          wealthy. He lived, highly esteemed, upon an inherited estate
          near Cordova, where he was educated with his lifelong friend
          [262]Eulogius by the abbot Speraindeo (d. before 852), author of
          a work against Islam and of a glorification of two Christian
          brothers who suffered martyrdom under Abd al-Rahman II. From
          this teacher Alvar and his fellow pupil imbibed a feeling of
          hatred toward the Mohammedans. Spanish Christians at the time
          were filled with a fanatical longing for martyrdom and found an
          easy way to the attainment of their desire by publicly reviling
          Mohammed, which was forbidden under the penalty of death. Alvar
          encouraged such proceedings, while Eulogius, after some
          hesitation, became the soul of the movement. In Alvar's chief
          work, the Indiculus luminosus (854), he undertakes to prove that
          Mohammed was a precursor of Antichrist and that it was therefore
          permissible to revile him. That he did not himself seek a
          martyr's death is explained by the often-repeated assertion of
          Eulogius, that only such should sacrifice themselves as were
          ripe for eternal life through personal holiness. The movement
          died out after Eulogius had suffered (859), and Alvar then wrote
          his friend's life in a strain of extravagant glorification. His
          last and most mature work was a Confessio, imitated (but not
          slavishly) from the Oratio pro correptione vitæ of Isidore of
          Seville; in mystico-contemplative form it expresses deep
          contrition and the longing for salvation. A few of Alvar's Latin
          poems have been preserved, and a Liber scintillarum, a sort of
          Christian ethics in the form of a collection of quotations from
          Biblical and ecclesiastical writers, is ascribed to him with
          probability by a Gothic manuscript of Madrid (cf. MPL, xc.
          94-95). His works are in MPL, cxv., cxxi.

   Alypius, Saint
          ALYPIUS, SAINT: 1. A saint of the Roman Calendar; b. of a
          prominent family at Thagaste, Numidia, in the fourth century. He
          became a pupil of Augustine in Carthage and later one of his
          most devoted friends, and was converted from Manicheanism by
          him. He preceded Augustine to Rome to study law and was assessor
          there to the court of the Italian treasury. When Augustine went
          to Milan, Alypius accompanied him, attended the preaching of
          Ambrose, was converted to Christianity, and baptized with
          Augustine on Easter, 387. With Augustine he returned to Africa
          and lived with him at Thagaste till in 391 Augustine became
          bishop of Hippo and Alypius abbot of a monastery at Thagaste. In
          394 he became bishop of Thagaste and survived Augustine. His day
          is Aug. 15. He is mentioned many times in Augustine's
          "Confessions" (vi. 7-16 and elsewhere), and several of
          Augustine's letters to him have been preserved.

          2. A saint of the Greek Calendar; b. at Adrianople about 550. In
          imitation of Simeon he stood upon a pillar, hence was called The
          Stylite. He is said to have died at the age of 108, and to have
          spent his last fifty years on his pillar. His day is Nov. 26.

          m. s.e. of Breslau), Silesia, June 29, 1808; d. at
          Freiburg-im-Breisgau Mar. 1, 1878. He studied at Breslau and
          Bonn, served as private tutor, and was ordained priest in 1834.
          He became professor of church history and exegesis at Posen
          (1836), Hildesheim (1845), and Freiburg (1853). While at Posen
          he supported his archbishop, [264]Martin von Dunin in his
          measures against mixed marriages. In 1869 he became a member of
          the commission on dogma in the preparation for the Vatican
          Council, and was the only member of the commission who held the
          declaration of papal infallibility as wholly inopportune. His

   Amalarius of Metz
          AMALARIUS, am-?-l??´rî-us, OF METZ (AMALARIUS SYMPHOSIUS):
          Liturgical writer of the ninth century; b. about 780; d. 850 or
          851. In his youth he enjoyed the instruction of Alcuin, and Metz
          has commonly been regarded as the place of his principal
          activity. He appears as a deacon at the Synod of Aachen in 817,
          and was mainly responsible for the patristic part of the Regula
          Aquisgranensis, which imposed the canonical life upon the clergy
          of the empire. In 825, now a chorepiscopus, he was in Paris for
          the synod called by Louis in connection with the iconoclastic
          controversy, and was selected by the emperor, with Halitgar of
          Cambrai, to accompany the papal envoys to Constantinople about
          this matter. The authorities do not relate whether he
          accomplished the mission, but it is certain that he once visited
          Constantinople. His principal work (written not earlier than
          819) was De ecclesiasticis officiis, in which he discusses all
          liturgical usages, the festivals and offices of the Church, and
          the vestments of the clergy down to the smallest detail, from
          the standpoint of mystical symbolism. The diversities between
          the German antiphonaries next drew his attention; and in 831 he
          went to Rome to ask Gregory IV. to issue an authorized Roman
          antiphonary. The pope did not see his way to do this, but he
          called Amalarius's attention to the Roman antiphonaries at the
          abbey of Corbie. He came home to revise his earlier book in the
          light of new sources, and compile an antiphonary based on the
          Frankish ones together with these Roman texts; the commentary on
          this forms his work De ordine antiphonarii. After the
          restoration of Louis to the throne, the rebellious archbishop of
          Lyons, [266]Agobard, was deposed, and Amalarius was put in
          charge of his diocese. Here he used his power to bring about a
          sweeping change in the liturgy, but aroused strong opposition,
          led by the deacon Florus, a warm partizan of Agobard, who worked
          against Amalarius unceasingly, and finally accused him of heresy
          at the Synod of Quiercy in 838. The synod condemned some of his
          expressions, and Agobard, shortly afterward returning to Lyons,
          began to undo all that he had done in regard to the liturgy.
          Nothing is known of his later life, except that in the
          controversy over Gottschalk's teaching he wrote in support of
          Hincmar. He is said to have been buried in the abbey of St.
          Arnulf at Metz. His writings give an insight into the liturgical
          forms of the early ninth century, and are especially
          illuminating on the relation of the Gallican liturgies to the
          Roman, which was gaining steadily in the Frankish empire. To its
          permanent conquest over the Gallican, Amalarius's work
          undoubtedly contributed. He is also important from his influence
          on later medieval liturgiologists, many of whom follow his
          mystical method, and most of whom quote him extensively. He
          shows a wide knowledge of Scripture and the Fathers, with
          praiseworthy diligence and conscientiousness in the use of his
          authorities. His works are in MPL, cv.

   Amalarius of Treves
          AMALARIUS OF TREVES (AMALARIUS FORTUNATUS): Archbishop of
          Treves. Little is known of his life, but he is not the same as
          the liturgiologist Amalarius of Metz, with whom he has been
          identified. He became archbishop about 809, and is supposed to
          be the Bishop Amalharius whom Charlemagne commissioned about 811
          to consecrate the newly erected church at Hamburg. In the spring
          of 813 he set out for Constantinople with Abbot Peter of
          Nonantula, to bring to a conclusion the negotiations for peace
          between the Frankish and Byzantine courts. The envoys, learning
          that Michael, to whom they were accredited, had been succeeded
          by Leo V., remained eighty days in Constantinople, and returned
          in company with two Byzantine ambassadors, to find Charlemagne's
          son Louis on the throne. This is the last known fact in
          Amalarius's life. There is no solid foundation for the
          assumption that he died in 814 or 816. Certain passages in a
          letter of his to Hilduin, abbot of Saint-Denis (ed. G. Meier, in
          Neues Archiv für ältere deutsche Geschichtskunde, xiii., 1887,
          307-323), have led to the supposition that he resigned his see
          (his successor Hetti was in possession of it in 816) and lived
          some time longer as head of a monastery. His writings are a
          short treatise on baptism, formerly ascribed to Alcuin, in
          answer to a letter of inquiry addressed by Charlemagne to the
          archbishops of his empire (in MPL, xcix. 887-902), and the
          Odoporicum or Versus marini, a poem of eighty hexameters, giving
          an account of his journey to Constantinople (MPL, ci. 1287-88,
          among the works of Alcuin; ed. E. Dümmler, in MGH, Poetæ lat.
          ævi Carol., i. 426-428, 1881; cf. Addenda, ii. 694).

   Amalek, Amalekites
          AMALEK, am´?-lek, AMALEKITES, am´-?lek-?its: A Bedouin people
          who are somewhat prominent in the older history of Israel. Their
          territory was the steppes south of the hill-country of Judea and
          the Sinaitic desert (the modern Tih; Gen. xiv. 7; Ex. xvii. 8;
          Num. xiii. 29, xiv, 25, 43, 45; I Sam. xv. 4-7, xxvii. 8). From
          Judges v. 14 and xii. 15 it has been conjectured that they once
          dwelt in Palestine and were gradually driven to the south.
          Neither the Old Testament nor extra-Biblical sources give
          satisfactory information concerning their ethnographical
          relations (cf. Nöldeke, Ueber die Amalekiter und einige andere
          Nachbarvölker der Israeliten, Göttingen, 1864). Israel is said
          to have gained a great victory over them at Rephidim while on
          the way to the promised land, and Yahweh then commanded the
          extirpation of this people (Ex. xvii. 8-16; cf. Deut. xxv.
          17-19; I Sam. xv. 2-3). Again when certain of the Israelites
          attempted, against Yahweh's command, to enter Canaan from
          Kadesh, they fell into the hands of the Amalekites (Num. xiv.
          45). In post-Mosaic time the Kenites lived in the southern part
          of the wilderness of Judah among nomad Amalekites (Judges i. 16,
          LXX.). They are said to have made forays against Israel in the
          narratives of Ehud and Gideon (Judges iii. 13, vi. 3, 33, vii.
          12), but it is doubtful if Amalekites were expressly named in
          the sources from which these narratives are drawn. At Samuel's
          command Saul made war upon them and gained a great victory;
          because he did not carry out the injunction to destroy them
          utterly he was rejected by the prophet (I Sam. xv.). Their king,
          Agag, is here named, and their sheep, oxen, and other
          possessions are mentioned, as well as a "city of Amalek," which
          is not referred to elsewhere. David attacked them after they had
          made a raid upon Ziklag, and only those who had camels escaped
          (I Sam. xxx.). Thenceforth the Amalekites disappear from history
          except for the notice, in I Chron. iv. 42, that a band of
          Simeonites (probably in the time of Hezekiah) exterminated the
          last remnant of them, dwelling on Mont Seir. That Haman is
          called an Agagite in Esther iii. 1 ("an Amalekite," Josephus,
          Ant., XI. vi. 5) has no significance, owing to the character of
          the book.

   Amalric of Bena
          AMALRIC, ?-mal´rik (Fr. Amaury), OF BENA AND THE AMALRICIANS,
          ?-mal-rîsh´?ns: A notable representative of pantheism in the
          Middle Ages and his followers. Amalric was born at Bena, near
          Chartres, and toward the end of the twelfth century lectured in
          Paris on philosophy and theology. He enjoyed the reputation of a
          subtle dialectician, and the favor of the Dauphin, afterward
          King Louis VIII. How far he carried his pantheism in the public
          teaching can not now be determined; but his doctrine of the
          membership of believers in the body of Christ was so pantheistic
          in tendency that it aroused suspicion, and he was accused of
          heresy by the chancellor of the diocese, who exercised an
          official oversight over the schools of Paris. In 1204 he was
          summoned to Rome to give an account of his teaching before
          Innocent III., who decided against him. Returning to Paris, he
          was forced to recant. Soon afterward he died, and received
          churchly burial at St.-Martin-des-Champs (1 m. e. of Morlaix,
          Finistère). After his death traces of a sect formed by him were
          discovered, and a synod was called in Paris in 1209 to take
          measures for its suppression. Amalric's teaching was condemned,
          and he himself was excommunicated; nine ecclesiastics together
          with William the Goldsmith, one of the seven prophets of the
          sect, were burned at the stake. At the Fourth Lateran Council in
          1215, Innocent III. renewed the condemnation of Amalric's
          teaching.

          There is no doubt that Amalric took up the teaching of Johannes
          Scotus Erigena, and developed it into a thoroughgoing pantheism.
          Only three propositions can certainly be ascribed to Amalric
          himself: (1) that God is all things; (2) that every Christian is
          bound to believe himself a member of Christ, and that none can
          be saved without this faith; and (3) that no sin is imputed to
          those who walk in love. The teaching of his disciples is an
          expansion of these theses. God, they said, has revealed himself
          thrice, and each time more completely. With the incarnation in
          Abraham the epoch of the Father begins; with the incarnation in
          Mary, that of the Son; with the incarnation in the Amalricians,
          that of the Holy Spirit. As the coming of Christ set aside the
          Mosaic law, so the sacraments and ordinances of the second
          dispensation were now abolished. The sect called the veneration
          of the saints idolatry; the Church, the Babylon of the
          Apocalypse; the pope, Antichrist. The revelation of the Holy
          Ghost in the hearts of the believers takes the place of baptism,
          and is indeed the resurrection of the dead and the kingdom of
          heaven; no other is to be expected; nor is there any hell but
          the consciousness of sin. Their doctrine, that the spirit, which
          is God, can not be affected by the deeds of the flesh, or commit
          sin, became a cover for manifold excesses, proven not only by
          contemporary records, but also by numerous testimonials as to
          the Brethren of the Free Spirit, who were the direct successors
          of the Amalricians.

   Amandus
          AMANDUS, ?-man´dus: Bishop and missionary of the Franks; d. at
          the abbey of Elno, near Tournai, Feb. 6, 661 (?). He was a man
          of rank from Aquitania, took holy orders in early youth against
          the will of his father, and lived in a cell in the city-wall of
          Bourges till he was induced by a vision of St. Peter to give
          himself up to missionwork in Friesland. He preached and baptized
          near Ghent. The Frankish government neglected to protect the
          mission near the frontier, and the hostility of the haughty
          Frieslanders hindered the work. Amandus therefore went to
          Carinthia and Carniola to seek a better field among the Slavic
          invaders, south of the Danube. Here, however, he was not
          successful; and he returned to Ghent, where he founded two
          monasteries, Blandinium and Gundarum, and a third, Elno, near
          Tournai. From these the Friesian mission-work was carried on
          with more success. Amandus was made bishop of Maestricht, and in
          this position he helped to carry through the Roman resolutions
          against the Monothelites, and tried to reform the clergy. As the
          latter showed themselves obstinate, he retired from his see
          between 647 and 649, entered the abbey of Elno, and worked to
          the end of his life for the conversion of the Frankish and
          Basque heathen. He was said to have performed miracles, and it
          was believed that miracles occurred at his tomb, which became a
          place of pilgrimage.

  I. Tell el-Amarna:

          The Amarna tablets are a collection of cuneiform documents, so
          called from Tell el-Amarna, the name by which the place where
          the tablets were discovered is generally known outside of Egypt.
          It is really a conventionalized word, compounded of the Arab
          tell, "mound," and a word formed either from the name of the
          Arabic tribe Amran or from a place near Amarieh. The place is
          160 miles above Cairo, between Thebes and Memphis, or, more
          closely, between Assiout and Beni-Hassan. The mound is the site
          of the city built by Amenophis IV., known otherwise as the
          heretic king Khu-en-aten, that he might there develop
          untrammeled by the hostile priesthoods his favorite cult of the
          disk of the sun (aten) with which he hoped to supersede all
          other cults and to unify the religion of Egypt (see [269]Egypt,
          I.). His attempt was of course opposed by all the priesthoods of
          all the other cults, and after his death his name was held
          accursed because of his efforts in that direction. His position
          in Egypt was very like that of Julian "the Apostate" among the
          Christians of Rome. The place which he built for his capital was
          allowed to fall into ruins, not being occupied after his death
          by any other king. It is this fact which accounts for the
          presence of the tablets there and also for their preservation.
          The foreign office of his reign with its archives was located
          there, and when the palace was disused, the chamber where the
          tablets were kept was covered by the débris of the
          disintegrating buildings. These facts constitute one of the
          strongest proofs of the genuineness of the documents, which
          indeed is established beyond all question. The mound was
          excavated in 1891-92 by W. M. F. Petrie and a corps of
          assistants under the auspices of the Egypt Exploration Fund. The
          finds made were most valuable, although the site had been rifled
          by Arabs and travelers. The entire reign of the king whose
          capital was there was illuminated by the finds, and the
          activities, religious, political, and industrial, were laid
          bare. That excavation was the result, however, not the cause, of
          the finding of the tablets. One of the hopes was that other
          tablets would be discovered, a hope which largely stimulated the
          search but was not realized.

  II. The Tablets:

          The discovery was accidental. In 1887 a peasant woman while
          searching in the ruins for antiquities to sell to travelers
          discovered the place of deposit within the palace enclosure. The
          tablets were all taken out, naturally without the extreme care
          which skilled excavators would have used, were conveyed down the
          river, and sold. Eighty-two letters and fragments came into the
          possession of the British Museum, 160 went to Berlin, the Gizeh
          museum has sixty, while a few are in private hands. In all,
          about 320 documents of the series are known. Some fragments were
          afterward found in the place of deposit by Petrie, verifying the
          location as given by the peasants, but adding hardly anything to
          the knowledge already gained. The tablets are different in many
          respects, particularly in shape, from those recovered from
          Babylonian and Assyrian mounds. Most of them are rectangular, a
          few are oval, some are flat on both sides, some convex on both,
          some pillow-shaped, some are kiln-dried, others sun-dried. Many
          of them confirm by the texture of the clay the assertions of the
          inscriptions as to their sources. Six of them are the largest
          known of this species of tablet, measuring ten inches by eight.
          The language, except in three of the documents, is the
          neo-Babylonian, closely related to Assyrian, Aramaic, Hebrew,
          and Arabic, approximating most closely the Assyrian. One letter
          is in the Hittite language but in the cuneiform script.
          Sometimes a Sumerian ideograph is used, of which the explanation
          occasionally follows either in Assyrian or in Canaanitic. In all
          but half a dozen tablets the general character of the writing is
          inferior, showing the work of unskilled scribes. The differences
          are often individualistic, and mannerisms which run through a
          whole series combine with other details to point infallibly to
          identity of source for that series. The spelling is poor, and
          modifications of characters occur which have not been discovered
          in other cuneiform documents. The tablets are all to be dated
          within the reigns of Amenophis III. and IV., father and son,
          about 1500-1450 b.c. Besides the foregoing, a tablet recognized
          by nearly all scholars as belonging to the series was found by
          Bliss in his excavation of Tell el-Hesy (Lachish) in Palestine.
          This contains the name of Zimrida of Lachish (almost certainly
          the writer of letter No. 217 in Winckler's arrangement, and
          mentioned in Nos. 181 and 219 of the same), not to be confounded
          with Zimrida of Sidon, who is also a correspondent (as is
          apparently done by Bliss, Mounds of Many Cities, London, 1896,
          pp. 54 sqq.). Some of the letters contain Egyptian dockets
          mostly illegible, probably notes of date of receipt and other
          remarks. The condition of the tablets varies greatly; on some
          only a few characters remain; others lack only a few to be
          complete.

  III. Authors and Contents:

          With the exception of some fragments of a bilingual dictionary,
          compiled by order of the Pharaoh, and a mythological fragment,
          the tablets are letters, most of which deal with the political
          situation of Syria, Palestine, and Philistia. The most
          noteworthy are the following: One letter is from Amenophis III.
          to Kallima-Sin of the Babylonian Kasshite dynasty, asking the
          latter for a daughter as a wife and replying to the latter's
          insinuation that there was no information that a former wife,
          sister of Kallima-Sin, was yet alive and well-treated. Four
          letters from Kallima-Sin to Amenophis III. complain that a
          Babylonian envoy was kept in Egypt six years, and when sent back
          brought only a small quantity of gold, and that of inferior
          quality. He asks more and better gold, which is needed at once
          for a building which he is erecting; he asks for a daughter of
          Amenophis as a wife, or if not that, then some one whom he can
          palm off as a daughter of the Pharaoh. One of the letters shows
          that he is sending his daughter to the harem of Amenophis. There
          are six letters of Burnaburiash of Babylon to Amenophis IV.,
          assuring the latter of the former's fraternal feelings, asking
          presents and promising others in return, also seeking help
          against his "vassal" Asshur-uballit of Assyria who revolts
          against the suzerain power. There is also a letter of
          Asshur-uballit to Amenophis IV., seeking presents, including
          gold for the decoration of a palace, similar to those which had
          been sent to his father Asshur-nadin-ahi, and promising others
          in return. Some of the finest, longest, and best-written are
          from Tushratta, king of Mitanni (see [270]Assyria), to Amenophis
          IV., one of whose wives is a sister of Tushratta. One of these
          promises a daughter of the writer to the Pharaoh, but it is
          expected that a great deal of gold (not alloyed like the last
          that was sent) will be returned for her. After considerable
          delay and, apparently, bargaining also the daughter was sent.
          This series tells too, of a victory of Tushratta over the
          Hittites, and might be taken to prove that Mitanni was not a
          Hittite kingdom. Three from the same person to Amenophis IV.
          include in their contents condolence upon the death of the
          Pharaoh's father, for which consolation is found by the writer
          in the fact that the son of that father succeeds to the throne;
          friendly relations are promised; two golden statuettes which
          have been promised are asked for (not wooden one likes those
          which have been sent); complaints are made about the detention
          of ambassadors in Egypt; and gold is requested. Tushratta also
          writes a letter to the queen dowager Ti, asking her good offices
          with the Pharaoh in urging the latter to fulfil the engagements
          entered into.

          The rest of the tablets contain correspondence from petty kings
          and governors of Amoritic, Syrian, Palestinian, and Cypriote (?)
          cities to the Pharaohs, telling of revolts and assaults upon the
          Pharaoh's authority, and of invasions by the Hittites and
          Habiri; or they make accusations against other of the Pharaoh's
          governors, or defend themselves as loyal subjects of Egypt. The
          most noteworthy of these are a series from Alashia (either a
          district in north Syria or Cyprus); fifty-seven from Rib-Addi of
          Gebal (Byblos) to the Pharaoh, and eight to Egyptian officers
          high in position; eight from Abi-Milki of Tyre (the name
          compounded of the name of the god for which "Moloch" was given
          in the Old Testament; see [271]Moloch); seven from Abd-?iba of
          Jerusalem (the latter spelled U-rusha-lim, "city of peace";
          Winckler, Tell-el-Amarna Letters, Letter 180, line 25), which
          tell of a confederation formed by Gezer, Ashkelon, and Lachish
          against Jerusalem, and asking help against them and the Habiri;
          two are from Ammunira of Beirut.

  IV. Value of the Tablets:

          The results gained from the study of the documents are
          threefold--historical, geographical, and linguistic.

    1. Historical.

          The most remarkable result of the discovery is the fact that the
          correspondence even between Egypt and its vassals was carried on
          not in Egyptian, but in an Asiatic tongue, and that the
          cuneiform. This implies that the entire area covered by the
          correspondence outside Egypt was controlled in culture by
          Babylonia. This control was so thoroughgoing that governmental
          transactions and diplomatic intercourse were necessarily carried
          on in the tongue of the lower Euphrates. The royal
          correspondence reveals the relations between the court of Egypt,
          on the one side, and the courts of Babylonia, Assyria, and
          Mitanni, on the other, consisting of intermarriages, with Egypt
          as the haughtier power in the earlier period, this strain of
          superiority giving way later to one of equality. The Pharaohs
          entered into marriage relations with the daughters of Asiatic
          regal houses, but at first refused and afterward granted the
          request for reciprocity in this respect. This division of the
          documents shows the kings making requests of each other for
          bakshish and complaining of the quality of that formerly given.
          Egypt seems the source of gold, and from the plaints appears
          guilty of attempting to cheat by alloying heavily the metal
          which it sent as a present, in one case the proportion of pure
          gold being only six parts in twenty. The relation of Assyria to
          Babylonia receives side-light in the fact that the Babylonian
          asks help against his "vassal" Asahur-uballit of Assyria, who,
          however, seems to be in friendly relations with Egypt; a second
          point in this connection is contained in the reference in the
          Tushratta correspondence to the sending of the image of Ishtar
          of Nineveh to Egypt, which implies that Nineveh was then a part
          of Mitanni (see [272]Assyria, vi., 2, and cf. C. Niebuhr,
          Studien . . . zur Geschichte des alten Orients, Leipsic, 1894,
          p. 92).

          But the most important results historically are those which
          relate to the connections of Egypt with Syria and Palestine.
          Thothmes III. had carried the arms of Egypt as far as the Taurus
          Mountains. A period of Egyptian quiescence had followed, and, as
          a consequence, in the period of the letters Egyptian hegemony
          was threatened in three ways: first by revolts of the cities
          under governors who had been appointed by the Pharaoh or by the
          governors who were unfaithful; second, by a Hittite advance from
          the north and northeast; third, by the Habiri from the east. The
          correspondence abounds in charges by governors who claim to be
          faithful to the Pharaoh against other governors; and again and
          again they beg for help from him which apparently is not sent,
          though the news of continuous loss of territory is the burden of
          the letters. Some of the men charged with rebellion protest
          their fidelity and make countercharges, but in many cases
          practically confess their disloyalty by their excuses for not
          rendering service due or required. The whole situation is one of
          the weakening of Egyptian influence as its leadership and
          control slips away under the battering of the triplex adverse
          forces. The mention of the advance of the Hittites is most
          illuminating, showing the beginning of the empire established in
          the century following. The question raised by the frequent
          mention of the Habiri has been answered in three ways: (a) they
          were the Hebrews of the Exodus just arriving from the wandering;
          (b) they were Hebrews, but not those of the Exodus, representing
          rather the Abrahamic-Lot tribes prior to the settlement in Egypt
          which is described in the last chapters of Genesis; (c) they
          were not Hebrews at all, but people of nomadic strain whose
          exact affiliations are unknown. The first of these three answers
          is not now supported by any prominent authority; the other two
          are still under debate. In favor of the second is the single
          Egyptian inscription (Meneptah's; see [273]Egypt) which plainly
          mentions the Hebrews as already in Canaan during the reign in
          which most modern scholars place the Exodus and before the
          tribes under Moses could have entered the land.

  2. Geographical.

          The geographical information can not be given here at length,
          since almost every item would require extended discussion. A
          large number of known cities or localities is named, such as
          Tyre, Sidon, Byblos, Beirut, Ajalon, Accho, Megiddo, Kadesh,
          Gath, Lachish, Jerusalem, Mitanni, and Edom, Other places are
          mentioned in such connections that the approximate locality is
          recognized, such as Tunip, south of Aleppo. Still other
          place-names appear in the correspondence, the exact or even
          approximate location of which is undetermined, such as ?a?na and
          Ir?ata. One hundred and thirty towns in all are mentioned. But
          the existence of these places is made known and their relative
          importance often appears from the character of the passage in
          which the names occur. For the political geography of the region
          and the time, these tablets are of the first importance.

    3. Linguistic.

          The linguistic data given in the letters afford a means of
          comparison of the Babylonian and Assyrian with earlier and with
          later forms, and so constitute a standard of comparison in what
          had been a dark period for both. For Aramean and Canaanitic the
          data are the earliest known and, therefore, of the highest
          value. These letters show the Semitic languages represented as
          differing only dialectically, and as in all probability mutually
          intelligible to the inhabitants of the different regions.

   Amaziah
          AMAZIAH, am´´??-z?´i??: Eighth king of Judah. He was the son of
          Joash, and reigned 838-810 b.c., according to the old
          computation; 797-792, according to Duncker; 800-792, according
          to Wellhausen; 796-778, according to Kamphausen; 799-773,
          according to Hommel. At the age of twenty-five he succeeded his
          father, who had been murdered by his servants, and his first act
          was to put the conspirators to death; in harmony with Deut.
          xxiv. 16, however, he spared their children. He attacked the
          Edomites, gained a victory over them, and captured a stronghold
          known as "the Rock," to which he gave the name "Joktheel." He
          may also have taken and destroyed Elath, which his son Uzziah
          rebuilt (II Kings xiv. 22). He next began war against Joash of
          Israel, but was defeated, and Jerusalem was taken and pillaged.
          Like his father, Amaziah was slain by conspirators, whose motive
          is not known. He was buried with royal honors at Jerusalem. The
          prophetic writers of the Book of Kings reckon him among the
          better kings of Judah, but the Chronicler ascribes his downfall
          to idolatry and apostasy from Yahweh.

   Ambo
          AMBO: A sort of raised platform in early Christian churches,
          used for a variety of purposes. The name is met with frequently
          in medieval works, more rarely in the older, which employ a
          number of synonymous expressions. Cyprian speaks of a pulpitum,
          by which he evidently means a raised place to which the lectors
          ascended to read to the people "the precepts and good tidings of
          the Lord." Eusebius relates (Hist. eccl., vii. 30) that Bishop
          Paul of Samosata erected both a "bema" and a lofty throne to
          speak from; and the context shows that he is not speaking of the
          semicircular apse, which was sometimes called "bema" also. So,
          according to Sozomen (Hist. eccl., viii. 5), John Chrysostom
          preached seated upon the platform (Gk. bema) of the readers; and
          the same historian speaks (ix. 2) of a grave placed "beneath the
          ambo," adding the definition "platform of the readers." Other
          expressions are analogius or analogium, suggestus, solea,
          pyrgus, and ostensorium. Other historians besides Sozomen
          mention Chrysostom going up into the "ambo" to preach, so as to
          be heard better.

          With the beginning of the Middle Ages, the mention of the ambo
          becomes frequent. Among the services of Pope Sixtus III. to the
          Church, Platina notes that he adorned the ambo or suggestus in
          the Basilica Liberiana, ubi evangelium et epistola canitur. The
          so-called liturgy of St. John Chrysostom contemplates the
          reading of the gospel in that place by the deacon. The use of
          the ambo for psalm-singing is evidenced, e.g., by the fifteenth
          canon of the Council of Laodicea (341?) which reads: "Besides
          the appointed singers, who mount the ambo and sing from the
          book, others shall not sing in the Church." While in primitive
          times the bishop was the only preacher, and taught the people
          from his throne or from the altar, in the succeeding centuries
          the cases grow more numerous in which he commits the office to
          other clergy, who choose the ambo from which to speak. Pastoral
          letters of the bishops were read from the same place. The ambo
          of St. Sophia in Constantinople had a special use, serving for
          imperial coronations. With all the variety of use the Middle
          Ages did not forget the original purpose of the ambo. Innocent
          III., commanding that the deacon shall go up into it to read the
          gospel, draws a parallel between it and the mountain from which
          the Lord taught the people. He prescribes two entrances; one for
          the deacon, the other for the subdeacon. It was considered
          proper that the gospel should be read from a higher step than
          the epistle, to show, as Hugh of St. Victor says, that the
          teaching of Christ is far higher than that of his apostles.

          The early rule was to have only one ambo in each church, and
          this continued in the Middle Ages, except in the largest
          churches. The position of the ambo in the primitive and early
          medieval churches can not be positively determined; presumably
          it stood in the nave, in front of the division between nave and
          choir. Where there were two, they were placed one on each side
          against the columns dividing nave from aisles. Sometimes, as in
          St. Clement's at Rome, the ambo formed an integral part of the
          screen dividing the clergy from the laity. As to material, the
          ambo was frequently made of wood. That which Abbot Suger of St.
          Denis restored about the middle of the twelfth century was
          decorated with tablets of ivory, and Emperor Henry II. gave one
          to the cathedral of Aachen which had not only ivory, but
          precious stones and gilded copper-plates set in the wood. Most
          of the extant older ambos are of marble, frequently adorned with
          mosaics or reliefs on the sides toward the congregation. As far
          as it is possible to form a general conception of their
          structure, they consisted of a flat base, either square, oblong,
          hexagonal, or circular, supported by columns or a plinth,
          sometimes, however, resting on figures of lions or men. Access
          to the ambo was given by one or two flights of steps, and it was
          railed around in front and occasionally surmounted by a canopy.
          Decoration was mainly used on the surface of the front, and was
          of infinite variety, and frequently of great richness.
          Especially beautiful are the marble reliefs with Biblical and
          allegorical scenes made for the churches of northern and central
          Italy by the artists of the twelfth and thirteenth centuries,
          with Niccolo Pisano at their head. Most of the ambos now extant
          are in Italy; notable northern examples are that already
          mentioned at Aachen, one at Halberstadt, and one at
          Windisch-Matrei. With the development of Gothic architecture the
          place of the ambo was taken in a general way by the rood-loft
          above the choirscreen, and the modern lectern and pulpit serve
          the same purpose. See [275]Pulpit.

   Ambrose of Alexandria
          AMBROSE OF ALEXANDRIA: Friend of Origen; d. about 250. Attracted
          by Origen's fame as a teacher, he visited his school about 212,
          and was converted by Origen from the Valentinian heresy to the
          orthodox faith (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., VI. xviii. 1). He was a
          sufferer during the persecution under Maximinus in 235
          (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., VI. xxviii.), and is last mentioned in
          Origen's Contra Celsum, which the latter wrote at the
          solicitation of Ambrose. He was wealthy and provided his teacher
          with books for his studies and secretaries to lighten the labor
          of composition (Eusbius, Hist. eccl., VI. xxiii. 1-2; Jerome, De
          vir. ill., lvi.). Origen often speaks of him in terms of
          affection as a man of education and literary and scholarly
          tastes. All of his works written after 218 are dedicated to
          Ambrose.

   Ambrose the Camaldolite
          AMBROSE THE CAMALDOLITE (Ambrogio Traversari, Lat.
          Traversarius): Prominent humanist; b. at Portico (36 m. n.e. of
          Florence) 1386; d. Oct. 20, 1439. He became general of the Order
          of the Camaldolites in 1431. Pope Eugenius IV. sent him to the
          Council of Basel, but his exertions in behalf of his master were
          unsuccessful, as were also his efforts at Ferrara and Florence,
          1438-39, toward a union with the Greeks. As an enthusiastic
          humanist Traversari offers "the first example of a monk in whom
          the polite scholar is in conflict with the Holy spirit" (G.
          Voigt, Die Wiederbelebung des klassischen Altertums, i., Berlin,
          1893, p. 321). At the table of Cosimo de' Medici where the most
          learned met, he took an active part in the conversation about
          the authors of antiquity. He studied especially the Greek
          ecclesiastical authors.

   Ambrose Saint, of Milan
          AMBROSE (Lat. Ambrosius), SAINT, OF MILAN: One of the great
          leaders and teachers of the Western Church; b. of a rich and
          noble Roman family at Treves c. 340; d. at Milan Apr. 4, 397. He
          was educated in Rome for the bar, and about 370 was appointed
          consular prefect for Upper Italy and took up his residence at
          Milan. In 374 a fierce contest arose in the city between the
          orthodox and the Arian parties concerning the election of a
          bishop to succeed Auxentius. Ambrose, as the first magistrate,
          repaired to the church to maintain order and was himself by
          unanimous vote transferred from his official position to the
          episcopal chair. He was as yet only a catechumen, but he was
          immediately baptized, and, eight days afterward (Dec. 7, 374)
          was consecrated bishop. As a leader of the Church Ambrose
          distinguished himself by his support of the orthodox faith. In
          379 he succeeded in establishing an orthodox bishop at Sirmium
          in spite of the efforts of the Arian empress Justina. In 385-386
          he refused to deliver up a basilica in Milan to the empress for
          Arian worship. These contests with Arianism he has reported
          himself in his letters to his sister Marcellina (Epist., xx.,
          xxii.) and to the Emperor Valentinian II. (Epist., xxi.), and in
          his oration De basilicis tradendis. Also with the Roman monk
          [276]Jovinian he had a sharp controversy (Epist., xlii.).

          Ambrose opposed paganism no less zealously than heresy. In the
          senate hall at Rome stood an altar to Victory on which all oaths
          were taken. In 382 Gratian had this altar removed, probably at
          the instigation of Ambrose. The senate, which favored the old
          religion, made repeated efforts to have the altar restored,
          under Gratian, Valentinian II., and Theodosius, but
          unsuccessfully owing to Ambrose's opposition. On the other hand,
          he held that the State, though it might interfere with paganism,
          must not interfere with the Church. In 388 the Christians burned
          a synagogue at Callinicum in Mesopotamia and Theodosius ordered
          that it be rebuilt at the expense of the bishop of the place,
          but Ambrose induced the emperor to recall the order. In 370 the
          people of Thessalonica during a riot murdered the military
          governor, and Theodosius retaliated with a fearful massacre;
          Ambrose rebuked the emperor and counseled him to do public
          penance (Epist., li.).

          As a teacher of the Church Ambrose concerned himself more with
          practical and ethical than with metaphysical questions; his
          writings are rich in striking practical remarks, but not
          original. Of his dogmatical works the De mysteriis reminds of
          Cyril of Jerusalem and the De fide and De spiritu sancto follow
          Basil very closely. Concerning the question of sin, Ambrose
          stands nearer to Augustine than the earlier Western Fathers or
          the Eastern theologians, but is more in accord with the earlier
          than with the later views of the great teacher. His exegetical
          works are mostly founded upon Basil and are marred by the
          allegorical method; their chief and best characteristic is their
          practical tendency. The same thing may be said of his sermons,
          which exhibit the full worth of the true Roman gentleman. Among
          his moral and ascetic works are De officiis ministrorum (modeled
          upon Cicero), De virginibus, De viduis, De virginitate, etc. The
          growing tendency toward asceticism shows itself in the high
          value he attached to celibacy, the martyr's death, and voluntary
          poverty; and the notion of a higher and purer Christian life to
          be attained by such means betrays the influence of the Stoic
          moral theory which he found in his model. Ambrose introduced a
          comprehensive reform in Church music (see [277]Ambrosian Chant);
          and a liturgy long used in the diocese of Milan is associated
          with his name by tradition. Of the hymns ascribed to him not
          more than four or five are genuine, and the Te Deum is not in
          this number (see [278]Te Deum). His extant works also include
          ninety-one letters.

          Ambrose was buried in the Ambrosian basilica at Milan near the
          martyrs Gervasius and Protasius. In the ninth century Archbishop
          Angilbert II. placed the remains of the three in a porphyry
          sarcophagus, which was discovered in 1864, and opened in 1871
          (cf. Biraghi, I tre sepolchri Santambrosiani, Milan, 1864; A.
          Riboldi, Descrizione delle reliquie dei SS. Ambrogio, Gervasio,
          e Protasio, 1874; F. Venosta, Sant' Ambrogio, la sua basilica,

   Ambrose, Isaac
          AMBROSE, ISAAC: Puritan; b. in Lancashire, England, 1604; d. at
          Preston 1664. He studied at Brasenose College, Oxford, and after
          1631 became one of the king's four preachers in Lancashire with
          residence at Garstang. Favoring Presbyterianism, he suffered
          imprisonment and other hardships during the civil war, and was
          ejected from Garstang for non-conformity in 1662. He is
          described as a learned man, of quiet and retiring disposition
          and sincere piety. His best-known work is Looking unto Jesus
          (London, 1658). A collected edition of his works appeared in
          1674 and has been often reprinted (Dundee, 1759; London, 1829,
          etc.).

   Ambrosian Chant
          AMBROSIAN CHANT: A lively, rhythmical, melodious congregational
          song, which grew out of a union of the ancient Greek musical
          system in four keys with the traditional Church psalmody.
          Whether it was introduced by Ambrose, bishop of Milan (374-397),
          or whether he merely regulated and improved it, is not certain.
          The singing had been confined to the choir (Gk. psaltai, Lat.
          cantores), who recited the psalms and prayers in monotonous
          fashion with no fixed rules. The new Ambrosian tunes were lively
          and joyous, all took part in the singing, and the people found
          pleasure and enjoyment in it. Augustine in his Confessions (IX.
          vii. 15; X. xxxiii. 50) speaks in glowing terms of the effect of
          this new method of singing, which was executed "with a clear
          voice and modulation most suitable." Antiphonal or responsive
          singing between men and women, congregational choirs, or
          congregation and choir, borrowed from the Greek Church, came
          particularly into use (see [279]Antiphon). As text Ambrose used
          the Greek and Latin hymns already existing, both rimed and
          unrimed. He also composed hymns himself, generally without
          rimes, but well adapted to the melodies; as Deus creator omnium;
          Jam surgit hora tertia; Æterne rerum conditor; Veni redemptor
          gentium; perhaps also O lux beata Trinitas; Splendor paternæ
          gloriæ.

          The Ambrosian music spread rapidly and was soon dominant
          throughout the West. But in course of time an artificial and
          profane manner crept in, which, toward the close of the sixth
          century, called forth the Gregorian reaction; and thus the
          singing in the churches was again confined to the choirs or the
          clergy. The popular, fresh, congregational singing of the
          Reformation period may be regarded as a partial revival of the
          ancient Ambrosian chant.

   Ambrosians
          AMBROSIANS: Name of several religious societies, organized in
          the city or diocese of Milan after the fourteenth century, which
          chose St. Ambrose as their patron. The only one to attain more
          than local importance was the Order of the Brethren of St.
          Ambrose of the Grove (Fratres S. Ambrosii ad Nemus), founded
          before 1530 by three pious Milanese, Alexander Crivelli, Alberto
          Besuzi, and Antonio Petrasancta, and called after their
          meeting-place, a grove outside the Porta Cumena in Milan, to
          which Ambrose used at times to resort (cf. his De bono mortis,
          iii. 11). Gregory XI. confirmed the society in 1375 on the rule
          of St. Augustine; Eugenius IV. in 1445 united it with three
          other Ambrose-brotherhoods, which had originated independently
          at Genoa, Eugubio, and Recanati near Ancona, into a Congregatio
          S. Ambrosii ad Nemus Mediolanensis. Sixtus V. brought about in
          1589 the reunion of the Milanese and a non-Milanese division of
          the order, which was temporarily separated under the name of
          Congregatio fratrum S. Ambrosia ad Nemus et S. Barnabæ. To these
          combined Ambrose and Barnabas orders, Paul V. granted many
          privileges in 1606. But Innocent X., considering the smallness
          and insignificance of the order, decided upon its dissolution
          about 1650. The bull with respect to it is given in the
          Bullarium magnum, iii. 194.

          The following societies were confined to Milan and its
          neighborhood: (1) The Nuns of St. Ambrose of the Grove, founded
          in 1475 by two ladies of Milan not far from Pallanza on Lago
          Maggiore. (2) The Schola S. Ambrosii or Oblationarii, a society
          of old men and women who undertook to assist at the Ambrosian
          mass in the churches of Milan, especially in bringing oblations
          (oblationes). (3) The Society of the Oblates of St. Ambrose,
          founded by Archbishop Carlo Borromeo and confirmed by Gregory
          XIII. in 1578. They were bound to strict obedience to superiors,
          especially the archbishop of Milan. During the seventeenth
          century the society was in a flourishing state and numbered
          about 200 members, but having decreased to only 16 in 1844 it
          was abolished.

   Ambrosiaster
          AMBROSIASTER: The name commonly used for the unknown author of
          the Commentaria in xiii. epistolas beati Pauli, which, from
          about 850 until the time of Erasmus, were commonly ascribed to
          Ambrose of Milan. This opinion, which is not yet quite extinct,
          has no support in ancient tradition, and there are many reasons
          against it--such as the style, the Scripture version used, the
          opinion about the authorship of the Epistle to the Hebrews, and
          the attitude toward Greek literature. But the idea that it is a
          compilation made about 800 is equally baseless. The Codex
          Cassinensis, though lacking Romans, shows that the commentary
          had its recognized form earlier than 570. The Scripture text is
          consistent, belonging to a time before Jerome and to the
          recension known as the Itala. The anthropology is naive
          pre-Augustinian; the eschatology is still millenarian; the
          polemics against heresy point to the period about 380; the
          filioque is lacking. Numerous small details of historical
          allusion point to the same date.

          Little success has attended the attempt to identify the author.
          Because Augustine in 420 quoted a passage as from sanctus
          Hilarius, some critics have been inclined to see in the
          Ambrosiaster's work a part of the lost commentary of Hilary of
          Poitiers on the Epistles. For a long time it was thought that
          Augustine referred to the Roman deacon Hilary, the partizan of
          Lucifer of Calaris. The presbyter Faustinus, the opponent of
          Damasus and author of a treatise on the Trinity, has also been
          suggested. But neither the style, the Scripture version used,
          nor the christology is his. The author was probably a presbyter
          of the Roman Church; possibly Augustine and he were both quoting
          Hilary. The attempt to identify him, on the ground of notable
          similarities, with the author of the pseudo-Augustinian
          Quæstiones ex utroque testamento has not met with general
          approval.

          Though the work of Ambrosiaster does not, from an antiquarian
          standpoint, belong to the most interesting relics of Christian
          antiquity, its exegesis is often valuable, distinguished by
          soberness, clearness, and richness of thought, and singularly
          unbiased and objective for its period. Certain prejudices, as
          against the speculations and "sophistries" of the Greeks, and
          against the deacons, are explicable by the circumstances of the
          time assigned above to its composition. The author repeatedly
          remarks that the institutions of the Church have undergone
          essential alterations since the apostles' time. Of great
          interest are his remarks about the primitive organization, which
          he considers to have been very informal, all teaching and all
          baptizing as occasion offered. He thinks that the primitive
          institutions were modeled after the synagogue; that presbyters
          and bishops were originally the same, as indeed, he says, they
          still are fundamentally; that the Roman Church was founded not
          by the apostles, but by certain Jewish Christians, who imposed a
          Judaic form upon it to be corrected by better-informed later
          arrivals; that not Peter alone, but Paul also, had a primacy. In
          a manuscript written about 769 by Winitharius, a monk of St.
          Gall, and elsewhere, Origen is named as the author, which is
          explicable by the presence of certain Origenistic ideas.

          (F. Arnold).

          In 1899 Dom Morin (Revue d'histoire et de littérature
          religieuse) suggested as the author of the "Ambrosiaster" works
          Isaac the Jew, a professed convert, who prosecuted Pope Damasus
          on a capital charge and who was said by the friends of the pope
          to have relapsed to Judaism and "profaned the Christian
          mysteries" (382 A.D.). In 1903 Morin withdrew this
          identification in favor of Decimius Hilarianus Hilarius, prefect
          of Rome in 383, and pretorian prefect of Italy in 396. A. Souter
          (formerly of Caius College, Cambridge, now professor at
          Mansfield College, Oxford), in an article in the
          Sitzungsberichte of the Vienna Academy, 1904, and in A Study of
          Ambrosiaster (TS, vol. vii., No. 4, 1905) adopted the later view
          of Morin, and from an exhaustive study of manuscripts and
          comparison of the Ambrosiastrian works with contemporary
          writings has concluded that this view "entirely satisfies the
          conditions of the problem," and he advises those who may incline
          to a different view to "read the works of the author carefully
          in the forthcoming Vienna edition [part of which he is himself
          editing] before coming to a conclusion on the subject." C. H.
          Turner, fellow of Magdalen College, Oxford, expressed hearty
          approval of Morin's first identification and, in an article in
          JTS (Apr., 1906, pp. 355 sqq.), refuses to be convinced by the
          arguments of Morin or those of Souter that Decimius Hilarianus
          Hilarius rather than Isaac the Jew wrote the "Commentaries" and
          the "Questions." The writer's millenarianism, extraordinary
          familiarity with Jewish history and customs, and unstrongly
          favorable to the theory that the books usually friendly attitude
          toward Judaism are were written by Isaac and are as strongly
          inimical to the theory that the official Decimius Hilarianus
          Hilarius was the author. Equally in favor of Isaac's authorship
          are allusions by Jerome to views regarding the genealogies,
          ascribed to some Judaizing teacher whose name he does not deign
          to mention, which are identical with those of "Ambrosiaster." A
          young Roman Catholic scholar Joseph Wittig, has recently
          advocated the Isaac hypothesis, and has called attention to the
          fact that "Isaac" and "Hilary" both mean "laughing" as a means
          of accounting for the ascription of the "Commentaries" to Hilary
          by Augustine. Recent writers (Harnack, Jülicher, Morin, Souter,
          Turner, and others) are agreed in attributing the Commentaria
          and the Quæstiones to the same author. The Commentaria as "the
          earliest commentary on the Pauline epistles" and the Quæstiones
          as "the earliest substantial book on Biblical difficulties," are
          of considerable importance. Jülicher pronounces the Commentaria
          "the best commentary on St. Paul's epistles previous to the
          sixteenth century," and Harnack is equally appreciative. Several
          other extant works are attributed to the same author.

   American and Foreign Christian Union
          AMERICAN AND FOREIGN CHRISTIAN UNION: A society organized May
          10, 1849, by the union (as indicated by the name) of the
          American Protestant Society (founded 1843), the Foreign
          Evangelical Society (instituted 1839 as the expansion of the
          French Association of 1835), and the Christian Alliance of 1842.
          The purpose was to prosecute more efficiently the work of the
          three societies named; viz., to convert Roman Catholics to
          Protestantism; or, to quote its constitution, "by missions,
          colportage, the press, and other appropriate agencies, to
          diffuse the principles of religious liberty, and a pure and
          evangelical Christianity, both at home and abroad, where a
          corrupted Christianity exists."

          For a number of years the society prospered, and spread its
          influence over Europe, North and South America, and adjacent
          islands. From 1849 to 1859 its yearly receipts averaged $60,000.
          But it was compelled gradually to contract its operations. It
          withdrew from France in 1866, from Italy and Europe, and other
          foreign stations generally, in 1873; and ultimately it limited
          its efforts to the support of the American Church in Paris. Its
          monthly periodical, The Christian World (35 vols., New York,
          1850-84), gave an account of its work; the number for April,
          1880, contains a historical sketch of the first thirty years;
          that for June, 1884, has the thirty-fifth annual report; consult

   Ames, William
          AMES, WILLIAM (Lat. Amesius): Puritan; b. at Ipswich, Suffolk,
          England, 1576; d. at Rotterdam Nov. 14, 1633. He studied at
          Christ's College, Cambridge, and became fellow. From the first
          he was a rigid and zealous Puritan and so without hope of
          preferment in the Church of England. In 1611 he went to Leyden,
          thence to The Hague, where he became chaplain to, Sir Horace
          Vere, commander of the English troops in the Netherlands, but
          lost this post through intrigues of the High-church party at
          home. He was paid four florins a day by the States General to
          attend the Synod of Dort (1618-19) and assist the president;
          became professor of theology at Franeker in 1622, and rector in
          1626; shortly before his death he became pastor of the English
          church in Rotterdam. He contemplated settling in New England,
          and his family went thither, taking with them his library. His
          influence on the Continent was considerable, and his reputation
          is greater there than in his native land. As a decided Calvinist
          he was active in the Arminian and other controversies of his
          time, both with voice and pen. His most noteworthy books were
          the Medulla theologica (Amsterdam, 1623; Eng. transl., The
          Marrow of Sacred Divinity, London, 1642) and the De conscientia
          et ejus jure vel casibus (1632; Eng. transl., Conscience, 1639),
          an ethical treatise which was really a continuation of the old
          scholastic casuistry. A collected edition of his Latin works,
          with life by M. Nethenus, was published in five volumes at
          Amsterdam in 1658.

   Amiot, Joseph Maria
          AMIOT (wrongly spelled Amyot), ??´´mî´´O´, JOSEPH MARIA: Jesuit
          missionary; b, at Toulon Feb. 18, 1718; d. at Peking Oct. 8,
          1793. He joined the Jesuits in 1737 and entered China as a
          missionary in 1751. The reigning emperor, Kien-Lung, was hostile
          to the Christians, but the missionaries were allowed to proceed
          to Peking and to work there, if not in the provinces. Father
          Amiot devoted himself assiduously for the rest of his life to
          the study of Chinese history, language, and literature and was
          one of the first to give Europe accurate information concerning
          Eastern Asia. The results of his work were published for the
          most part in the Mémoires concernant les Chinois (15 vols.,
          Paris, 1776-91), in the proceedings of learned societies, and in
          the Lettres édifiantes et curieuses (34 vols., 1717-76). They
          include a life of Confucius (Mémoires, vol. xii.) and a
          Dictionnaire tartare-mantchou-français (ed. Langlès, 3 vols.,
          1789-90).

   Amling, Wolfgang
          AMLING, WOLFGANG: German Reformed theologian; b. at Münnerstadt
          (35 m. n.n.e. of Würzburg), Franconia, in 1542; d. at Zerbst May
          18, 1606. He studied at Tübingen, Wittenberg, and Jena; was
          appointed rector of the school of Zerbst in 1566, minister at
          Koswig in 1573, and, shortly after, minister and superintendent
          at St. Nicolai in Zerbst. He was vehemently opposed to the
          Formula Concordiæ, and led the population of Anhalt from
          Lutheranism to Calvinism. He wrote the Confessio Anhaldina
          (1578).

   Ammianus Marcellinus
          AMMIANUS MARCELLINUS, am´´mî-??´nus m??r´´sel-lî´nus: Author of
          a Roman history (Rerum gestarum libri xxxi.) extending from
          Nerva to the death of Valens (96-378). He was a native of
          Antioch, and is said to have died about 400. He devoted himself
          to philosophical studies, entered the army under Constantius,
          accompanied Julian in the war against the Persians, and took
          part under Julian's successors in the wars both of the Orient
          and the Occident. He afterward retired to Rome and resumed his
          studies. The first thirteen books of his history are lost; the
          remaining eighteen, beginning with the year 353, give much
          valuable information concerning the general State of the Church
          and many important particulars--the character of Julian, his
          proceedings, views held by the educated concerning Christianity,
          etc.

          The question whether Ammianus was a Christian has often been
          raised. At present the generally accepted view is that he was
          not. His work contains many caustic remarks on the doctrines of
          Christianity. He speaks of the martyrs, of synods, and of other
          details of the Christian system, in a way which points to a
          non-Christian author. It is, however, equally certain that he
          was not an adherent of the common paganism. He recognized a
          supreme numen, which curbs human arrogance and avenges human
          crime, and, in general, his views are those of the best Greek
          writers, approaching a monotheistic standpoint. It seems
          probable that he believed that primitive pure Christianity and
          the philosophy of enlightened pagans were the same. From this
          point of view Ammianus could consistently speak with favor of
          many things he found among the Christians. He censures
          Constantine's interference in the Arian controversy and calls it
          a "confusion of the absolute and plain Christian religion with
          old-womanish superstition," meaning by "superstition," as the
          connection shows, the controversy concerning the Trinity and the
          divinity of Christ. He censured the emperor Julian for
          forbidding to the Christians instruction in liberal studies,
          while he did not blame the restoration of pagan sacrifices at
          the beginning of Jovian's reign. He was not opposed to the
          paganism of Julian, but to the violation of religious
          toleration.

   Ammon, Christoph Friedrich von
          AMMON, CHRISTOPH FRIEDRICH VON: German theologian; b. at
          Baireuth Jan. 16, 1766; d. in Dresden May 21, 1850. He
          distinguished himself as a student at Erlangen, and became
          professor there in 1789. In 1794 he went to Göttingen as
          professor, university preacher, and director of the theological
          seminary; returned to Erlangen in 1804; in 1813 went to Dresden
          as court preacher; became member of the Saxon ministry of
          worship and public instruction in 1831, and vice-president of
          the consistory in 1835. He was a versatile and many-sided man,
          an accomplished scholar in diverse fields, an influential
          official in Church and State, a prolific writer, and much
          admired as preacher and orator. The most noteworthy of his
          theological writings were: Entwurf einer reinen biblischen
          Theologie (3 vols., Erlangen, 1792; 2d ed., 1801-02); Handbuch
          der christlichen Sittenlehre (1795; 2d ed., 3 vols., Leipsic,
          1838); Summa theologiæ christianæ (1803; 4th ed., ib. 1850); Die
          Fortbildung des Christentums zur Weltreligion (ib. 1833; 2d ed.,
          4 vols., 1836-40). At first Ammon was a decided rationalist, but
          his tone changed in successive editions of his works, and in
          1817 he surprised his friends by defending the theses of
          [295]Claus Harms in Bittere Arznei für die Glaubensschwäche der
          Zeit (Hanover). Later he returned to his earlier views, and his
          vacillation subjected him to, much harsh criticism. His last
          writings were Die Geschichte des Leben Jesu (3 vols.,
          Leipsic,1842-47) and Die wahre und falsche Orthodoxie (1849).
          From 1813 to 1822 he was editor of the Kritisches Journal der
          neuesten theologischen Litteratur.

   Ammonites
          AMMONITES: A people of Palestine, allied, according to Gen. xix.
          38, to Abraham through Lot, and therefore, like the brother
          people Moab, akin to the other Abrahamic nations, Israel,
          Ishmael, and Edom. The name is here explained as ben ammi, "son
          of my kinsman." Their territory lay east of the Jordan and north
          of Moab, from whom they were separated by the Arnon (Num. xxi.
          13). An Amoritic king, Sihon, and, later, the Israelites are
          said to have excluded them from the western and richer part of
          this district and to have confined them to the steppe lands
          farther to the east (Josh. xii. 2, xiii. 10, 25; Judges xi. 22).
          Cities belonging to them are mentioned (Judges xi. 33; II Sam.
          xii. 31), whence it appears that they were in part a settled
          people, in part nomadic. Their chief city and the one most
          frequently named was Rabbah (Rabbath-ammon; Deut. iii. 11; Josh.
          xiii. 25; II Sam. xii. 26-27; Ezek. xxi. 20; and often), the
          modern Amman. They had a king in the earliest time. Their
          religion was doubtless like that of the Moabites; their chief
          divinity was Milcom (I Kings xi. 5, 33; II Kings xxiii. 13; the
          mention of Chemosh as god of the Ammonites in Judges xi. 24 is
          probably an error; see [296]Chemosh). The name "Milcom" has been
          explained as meaning "Am is king," Am (Am) being the name of an
          older deity (cf. Balaam, "Am is lord," and Gen. xix. 38). The
          relations between the Israelites and Ammonites were generally
          hostile (Judges xi.; I Sam. xi.; II Sam. x. 1-14, xii. 26-31; II
          Kings xxiv. 2; II Chron. xx.; Neh. ii. 10, iv. 3, vi. 1; Jer.
          xl. 13-14, xlix. 1-6; Ezek. xxv. 1-10; Amos i. 13; Zeph. ii. 8);
          and this fact is reflected in the account of their disgraceful
          origin in Gen. xix. 30-38. Solomon had an Ammonitish wife (I
          Kings xiv. 21). Assyrian inscriptions state that Baasha, king of
          Ammon, was among the allies defeated by Shalmaneser II. at
          Karkar (854 B.C.), and show that the Ammonite Puduilu, a
          contemporary of Manasseh of Judah, like all the west-Asiatic
          princes of the time, was a vassal of Esarhaddon (681-668 B.C.).

          In postexilic times also the Ammonites shared the fortunes of
          their neighbors, and were under Persian, Egyptian, and Syrian
          rule. Their old capital Rabbah was made a Hellenistic city and
          named "Philadelphia" after Ptolemy II., Philadelphus. In 218
          B.C. it was captured under Antiochus the Great. In the Maccabean
          period the Ammonites were under a tyrant Timotheus, whom Judas
          defeated in several battles (I Macc. v. 6-8). About 135 B.C.
          Philadelphia was ruled by a tyrant named Zeno Cotylas (Josephus,
          Ant., XIII. viii. 1). It was included in the Decapolis by
          Pompey, and long remained under Roman rule. At the beginning of
          the Jewish wars, like most of the Hellenistic cities, it was
          attacked by the Jews. The name "Ammonite" occurs for the last
          time in Justin Martyr (d.166), who says they were very numerous.
          The present extensive ruins at Amman belong to Roman times.

   Ammonius
          AMMONIUS, am-mO´ne-us, OF ALEXANDRIA: An Alexandrian of the
          third century who is thought to have made one of the earliest
          attempts to prepare a harmony of the Gospels. Eusebius (Hist.
          eccl., vi. 19) and Jerome (De vir. ill., lv.) strangely confuse
          him with [297]Ammonius Saccas. He may have been a younger
          contemporary of Origen. Of his work nothing is known except what
          may be gathered from a statement of Eusebius (Epist. ad
          Carpianum), that he put beside the text of the Gospel of Matthew
          the parallel passages from the three other Gospels. Whether he
          wrote out the parallels in full, or merely indicated them by
          some system of reference, and whether or not he also included
          the variants from Matthew can only be conjectured. His work was
          probably intended for the learned rather than for general use.
          The so-called Ammonian sections are contained in the edition of
          the "Tables" of Eusebius (i.e., his gospel harmony), using the
          Authorized Version as text, prepared by S. H. Turner (New York,

          education, but returned to heathenism. For a long time, it is
          said, he earned his living as a porter and carried the grain
          sacks from the ships; hence his name. Herennius, Longinus,
          Plotinus, and Origen the Neoplatonist, as well as the Christian
          Origen, were among his pupils. He wrote nothing, and it is
          impossible to reproduce his system from the statements of his
          disciples.

   Amolo
          AMOLO, am´O-lO: Archbishop of Lyons, 841-852. He was educated in
          the school of Lyons under Agobard, whom he succeeded in the
          archbishopric, and whom he resembled in his freedom from
          credulity and superstition. In a letter to Theotbold, bishop of
          Langres, dealing with a case of the exhibition of unauthorized
          relics by two men who came from Italy and pretended to be monks,
          he advised that they should be prohibited, citing other cases in
          his experience which had been mere fraud and avarice. Amolo also
          followed Agobard in his protest against the powerful position
          which the Jews were acquiring in the south of France. His book
          Adversus Judæos, dedicated to Charles the Bald, contains some
          interesting details as to the Messianic expectations of the Jews
          at the beginning of the Middle Ages. In a letter to Gottschalk,
          who had sought to find in him a supporter, he exhorts the
          imprisoned monk to submit to the judgment of the ecclesiastical
          authorities, and definitely repudiates several of his assertions
          on the subject of predestination. His works are in MPL, cxvi.,
          and his letters in MGH, Epist., v. (1899) 361 sqq.

   Amon, Egyptian Deity
          AMON, EGYPTIAN DEITY: The local deity of Thebes in Upper Egypt.
          The etymology of the name, as in the case of most Egyptian
          deities, is uncertain; the theologians of the later time
          explained it as meaning "the concealed," from the root 'MN, "to
          be veiled, hidden." Amon appears to have been originally a
          harvest-god; but as early as the Middle Kingdom he was thought
          of as sun-god, according to the teaching that all Egyptian
          deities, whatever might be their names, were only different
          forms of the one sun-god. As such he was called
          Amon-Ra-setn-nteru, "Amon the Sun God, the King of the Gods,"
          and was later identified by the Greeks with their Zeus (hence
          the late Greek name for Thebes, Diospolis). His holy animal was
          a ram with horns curving downward. He is usually represented in
          human form, blue in color, wearing a close-fitting hat with two
          long upright plumes. Less often he is represented ithyphallic,
          in the form of the harvest-god, Min of Koptos, with whom he was
          often identified. Ram-headed figures of Amon are also found,
          especially in Nubia.

          Amon gained much from the changed political conditions after the
          fall of the Old Kingdom. Thebes became the metropolis of Egypt
          and its god took the chief place in the Egyptian pantheon. The
          Pharaohs undertook their campaigns in Asia and Nubia in the name
          of Amon and naturally the lion's share of the booty fell to him.
          His great temple, near the present Karnak, "the throne of the
          world," was begun by the kings of the twentieth dynasty, and was
          extended and adorned by succeeding generations until it became
          the most imposing of Egyptian temples (see [300]No). His worship
          was introduced in the conquered provinces and his sanctuaries
          arose all over Nubia, in the oases of the Libyan desert, and in
          Syria. Under the New Kingdom he was preeminently the national
          god of Egypt. The only check to the growth of his power and
          wealth was the abortive attempt of Amenophis IV., about 1400
          B.C., to introduce the worship of the sun's disk. Under the
          Ramessids Amon's possessions were almost incredible (cf. Erman,
          Life in Ancient Egypt, London, 1894, pp. 302-303). His high
          priest came to be the first person in the State after the king,
          and eventually, toward the end of the twentieth dynasty, was
          able to supplant the latter. The priests of Amon did not long
          retain the throne, but their great wealth perpetuated their
          political influence until the twenty-sixth dynasty, when their
          power seems to have declined, and Amon gradually sank back to
          the position of a local deity. In the oases, however, and in
          Ethiopia his worship and the authority of his priests lasted
          till Roman times and the introduction of Christianity.

   Amon, King of Judah
          AMON, ê´m?n, KING OF JUDAH: Fourteenth king of Judah, son and
          successor of Manasseh. He reigned, according to the old
          chronology, 642-641 B.C.; according to Kamphausen, 640-639;
          according to Hommel, 641-640. During his short reign nothing of
          importance took place. Judah, which was tributary to the
          Assyrians, enjoyed peace. Amon walked in the ways of his father,
          Manasseh, imitated the Assyrians in worshiping the heavenly
          bodies, and continued the Baal and Moloch cults. His servants
          conspired against him and slew him. The "people of the land"
          rose up against the conspirators, slew them, and made Josiah,
          his son, eight years old, king in his stead. His history is
          found in II Kings xxi. 18-26; II Chron. xxxiii. 20-25.

   Amorites
          AMORITES, am´Oraits: According to Gen. x. 15-18; I Chron. i.
          13-16, one of the eleven tribes descended from Canaan. They are
          frequently mentioned in lists of the Palestinian peoples
          dispossessed by Israel (Gen. xv. 21; Ex. iii. 8; Deut. vii. 1;
          Josh. iii. 10; etc.). As distinguished from the Canaanites, they
          seem to have formed the chief part of the population of the
          west-Jordan highlands (Num. xiii. 29; Deut. i. 7, 19-20, 44;
          Josh. v. 1, x. 6). In certain passages (particularly in E and D)
          the term is used as a general designation of the pre-Israelitic
          peoples of Palestine (Gen. xv. 16; Josh. vii. 7, xxiv. 15, 18;
          Judges vi. 10; I Sam. vii. 14; II Sam. xxi. 2; I Kings xxi. 26;
          II Kings xxi. 11; Isa. xvii. 9, LXX.; Ezek. xvi. 3; Amos ii.
          9-10). In Judges i. 34-35 the people of the lowlands west of the
          mountains of Judah are called Amorites. Elsewhere (as in Gen.
          xiv. 7, 13, xlviii. 22, and in many passages in which the
          east-Jordan kings, Sihon and Og, are called Amorites) it is
          doubtful whether or not a particular tribe is meant. The
          extra-Biblical sources have raised new problems instead of
          throwing light on the ethnographical question. The "Amara" of
          the Egyptian inscriptions, who are usually identified with the
          Amorites, lived in the valley between Lebanon and Anti-Lebanon
          (cf. W. Max Müller, Asien und Europa, Leipsic, 1893, pp.
          218-233). Hence it seems probable that the Amorites moved
          southward in the fifteenth century B.C.--a movement which may be
          referred to in the Tell el-Amarna letters (cf. H. Winckler,
          Geschichte Israels, i., Leipsic, 1895, p. 52).

          (F. Buhl.)

          The Amorites are mentioned in the Old Testament more frequently
          than any other people of Palestine except the Canaanites. West
          of the Jordan they seem to have been confounded the one with the
          other; but as the Canaanites are never said to have lived east
          of the Jordan so the Amorites do not appear on the Mediterranean
          coast-land. The difficult question as to whether or not the two
          peoples are essentially identical is probably to be decided in
          the negative, though it is quite possible that the Amorites as
          well as the Canaanites were a Semitic people. There is, in any
          case, no sufficient warrant for the assumption of Sayce and
          others that they were akin to the Libyans. The Babylonian name
          for Canaan, mat Amurê, "land of the Amorites" shows that at
          least the eastern side of Palestine was Amoritic at an early
          date, and it is a plausible supposition that the two related
          peoples separated in southern Syria, the Canaanites following
          the coast-land (their proper home) and then spreading eastward
          to the hill-country, and the Amorites coming gradually
          southward, mainly east of the Jordan. A learned annotator
          intimates (Deut. iii. 9) that they were once the dominant people
          about Anti-Lebanon, as the "Sidonians" or Phenicians were about
          Lebanon. After their loss of the Moabite country (Num. xxi.
          21-35) they were gradually absorbed by the Hebrews, Amorites,
          and Arameans.

   Amos
          AMOS, ê´m?s:

  Life.

          The third of the minor prophets, originally a herdsman and
          farmer of Tekoa (a town twelve miles s.s.e. of Jerusalem), and
          destitute of a prophetical education (Amos i. 1, vii. 12,
          14-15). The Fathers wrongly identified him witht he father of
          Isaiah (Amoz), because his name in the Septuagint is identical
          with that of Isaiah's father. He prophesied in the Northern
          Kingdom during the reigns of Uzziah in Judah (777-736 B.C.) and
          Jeroboam II. in Israel (781-741), when Israel was at the very
          height of its splendor (i. 1, vii. 10-11). His prophecies were
          apparently all given in one year, specified as "two years before
          the earthquake," a momentous but undatable event (i. 1; cf.
          Zech. xiv. 5; Josephus, Ant., IX. x. 4, gives a fabulous story).
          The place was Beth-el, the greatest sanctuary of the Northern
          Kingdom. His plain speaking led to the charge of conspiracy, and
          he was compelled to return to Judah (Amos vii. 10-12). Nothing
          more is known of him.

  The Book of Amos.

          The Book of Amos, after the opening verse, is divisible into
          three parts: (1) Chaps. i. 2-ii. 16, describing the judgments of
          God upon Damascus (i. 3-5), Philistia (i. 6-8), Tyre (i. 9-10),
          Edom (i. 11-12), Ammon (i. 13-15), Moab (ii. 1-3), Judah (ii.
          4-5), and Israel (ii. 6-16). (2) Chaps. iii.-vi., a series of
          discourses against the Northern Kingdom threatening punishment
          and judgment. The subdivision of this section is a matter of
          dispute. The prophet sets forth in his usual rhetorical manner
          the moral and religious degeneracy of the people. (3) Chaps.
          vii.-ix., beginning with three successive threatening visions
          (vii. 1-3, 4-6, 7-9). These were made the basis of the complaint
          against Amos of Amaziah, high priest at Beth-el, to the king
          Jeroboam II., and hence resulted his banishment (vii. 10-13).
          Before he goes, however, he insists upon the reality of his call
          (vii. 14-15), and foretells the sad fall of the high priest and
          his family (vii.16-17). Chaps. vii., viii., and ix. contain two
          visions and their explanations. The first is of threatening
          content, but the second (ix. 1-7) adds a promise of salvation
          for a faithful remnant and of the universal sway of religion and
          prosperity (ix. 8-15). The book gives only an abstract of the
          prophet's complete discourses.

          The style of Amos is rhetorical. His figures, analogies, and
          similes are excellent, though at times surprising (cf. iii. 3-6;
          iv. 2; v. 7; xiii. 11-14). The notion that Amos borrows his
          similes chiefly from his early mode of life, and thus betrays
          his extraction, is generally accepted; but it is hardly well
          founded when the variety of them is observed (cf. ii. 13; iii.
          4, 5, 8, 12; vi. 12; viii. 8; ix. 5; and the visions of vii. 1
          and viii. 1). On the other hand, the Hebrew of Amos is abnormal,
          but it is uncertain how much belongs to the author himself. The
          integrity and genuineness of the book are generally
          acknowledged; only i. 9-11; ii. 4, 5; iii. 14b; iv. 13; v. 8, 9;
          viii. 6, 8, 11, 12; ix. 5, 6, 8-15, partly on account of the
          contents, partly on account of the connection, have been
          regarded as glosses by modern critics (Duhm, Stade, Giesebrecht,
          Cornill, Schwally, Smend, Wellhausen).

  Its Importance.

          The modern school of Biblical scholars regard the Book of Amos
          as the oldest written testimony to that activity of the prophets
          of the eighth century B.C. whereby the religion of Israel was
          given a more ethical and spiritual character. It is therefore
          important to note its contents and presuppositions. Two evils in
          the moral and religious conditions of the Northern Kingdom
          receive the prophet's severe condemnation, viz., the
          reprehensible conduct of the high and mighty (ii. 6-7a; iii. 10;
          iv. 1; v. 7, 11-12; viii. 4-6), and the perverted religious
          forms and observances (ii. 7b-8; v. 26; viii. 14). The latter,
          with their idolatrous representations of the deity, were
          specially offensive to a pious Judean, who believed that Yahweh
          dwelt on Zion and not in visible form. Reliance upon the
          offerings, gifts, feasts, and processions of Beth-el and the
          other sanctuaries as a means of securing Yahweh's favor was a
          terrible mistake, which could only bring the most direful
          consequences (iv. 4-13; v. 4-6, 21-24; ix. 1-8). The true way to
          serve Yahweh was to become like him and to practise goodness and
          righteousness (v. 14, 24). The prophet makes no claim to new
          ideas concerning Yahweh or his relations to the world in general
          and to Israel in particular. What he has to say upon these
          topics is all assumed as already known to the pious. It is the
          idolatrous worship, with its attendant evils, which he
          reprobates and wishes to correct.

   Amphilochius, Saint
          AMPHILOCHIUS, am´´fi-lO´ki-us, SAINT: Apparently a cousin of
          Gregory Nazianzen, and closely associated with him and with
          Basil the Great in directing the policy of the Church at the
          time of the defeat of Arianism. He was originally a lawyer, but
          retired to a life of devotion and asceticism. In 373 he was
          chosen bishop of Iconium, the metropolitan see of Lycaonia. The
          year of his death is uncertain; but Jerome includes him as still
          living, in his De virus illustribus (392), and he appears as
          taking part in a synod at Constantinople in 394. Of the numerous
          works ascribed to him by Combefis (cf. MPG, xxxix.), not a few
          are doubtless not genuine. Late investigation, however, has
          brought to light other genuine works of Amphilochius. The
          Epistola synodica in defense of the orthodox doctrine of the
          Trinity (376), and the Iambi ad Seleucum, ascribed to Gregory
          Nazianzen (MPG, xxxvii.), not without importance for the history
          of the canon, are not the only works of Amphilochius which are
          still extant.

   Ampullae
          AMPULLÆ, am-pul´lî or -lê: [Flasks or vials for holding liquids.
          In ecclesiastical usage they have been employed for the water
          and wine of the mass and for the consecrated oil used in
          baptism, confirmation, and extreme unction. Such vessels were
          sometimes of considerable size and were made of gold, silver,
          crystal, onyx, or glass. Specimens are preserved at Paris,
          Cologne, Venice, and elsewhere; and there is one at Reims said
          to have been miraculously provided for the baptism of Clovis in
          496.] Deserving of most notice are the so-called ampullæ
          sanguinolentæ, phiolæ cruentæ or rubricatæ ("blood-ampullæ"),
          glass flasks which contain a reddish sediment and are alleged to
          have once held the blood of martyrs. They have been found almost
          exclusively in the graves of the catacombs, near the slab with
          which the grave was sealed or fastened to it by mortar. They are
          first mentioned by Antonio Bosio, the explorer of the Roman
          catacombs, who relates that in certain graves as well as in
          glass or clay vessels, he found blood congealed and dried,
          which, when moistened with water, assumed its natural color
          (Roma sotterranea, Rome, 1632, p. 197). Soon afterward a certain
          Landucci discovered such vessels with a watery or milky fluid
          which, when shaken, assumed the color of blood (De Rossi, 619).
          The discovery of a phiola rubricata came to be regarded as
          certain proof of a martyr's grave, and the Congregation of the
          Sacred Rites decided accordingly in 1668 when doubts were raised
          concerning the indicia martyrii at the removal of relics from
          the catacombs. Doubts continued, however, and a Jesuit, Victor
          de Buck, made the strongest presentation of the case of the
          skeptics, arguing on scientific grounds (De phiolis rubricatis,
          Brussels, 1855). After a new find in the cemetery of S.
          Saturnino in 1872 a papal commission undertook an exact
          microscopical investigation, which was believed to establish the
          presence of blood. Roman Catholic archeologists and theologians
          had generally conceded a possibility that the claims might be
          well founded, while opposing the unsystematic and unscientific
          assumption that all red sediment was blood, and demanding an
          adequate investigation in each case.

          The following weighty and conclusive objections, however, are
          made even to the possibility: (1) There is no literary testimony
          that the blood of martyrs was preserved as is presupposed, and
          no satisfactory reason has been given why it should have been
          thus saved. (2) A large percentage of these ampullæ come from
          the graves of children under seven years of age, who can hardly
          have suffered in the persecutions of the Christians;
          furthermore, more than one-half of them are of the time of
          Constantine or later. (3) Non-Christian graves furnish similar
          vessels with red sediment. (4) In no case has the sediment been
          proved to be blood by chemical and microscopic examination. The
          attempt made in 1872 is untrustworthy, and its results are
          rejected by competent judges. (5) The specimens with
          inscriptions (such as sang., sa., and the like) and the monogram
          of Christ or the cross are forgeries. The red sediment is
          probably oxid of iron produced by the decomposition of the
          glass. It has been suggested that it is the remains of communion
          wine, and the sixth canon of the Synod of Carthage of 397 lends
          support to the view, but the chemical analysis is against it
          (cf., however, Berthelot in Revue archéologique, new series,
          xxxiii., 1877, p. 396). Certain heathen burial customs in which
          wine (cf. Schultze, Katakomben, pp. 52, 54, and note 15) or oil
          was used offer analogies. The original purpose and significance
          of these ampullæ was probably not uniform.

   Amsdorf, Nikolaus von
          AMSDORF, NIKOLAUS VON: German Protestant; b. at Torgau (30 m.
          n.e. of Leipsic) Dec. 3, 1483; d. at Eisenach May 14, 1565. He
          began his studies at the University of Leipsic in 1500, but two
          years later went to Wittenberg, being among the first students
          in the newly founded university in that city. There he fell
          under the influence of Luther, whose intimate friend he became,
          and to whose teachings he lent unquestioning adhesion from the
          very beginning. He was with Luther at the Leipsic disputation in
          1519, accompanied him to Worms in 1521, and was in the secret of
          his sojourn at the Wartburg. In 1524 he became pastor and
          superintendent in Magdeburg and was active in introducing the
          Reformation into that city, organizing the ritual closely on the
          model of Wittenberg. He performed similar services in Goslar and
          Einbeck. From the first he was rigid in his views, opposed to
          the least departure from the orthodox Lutheran doctrine, and
          fierce in his attacks on such men as Melanchthon and Butzer who
          came to represent a policy of conciliation and compromise both
          within the Protestant Church and toward the Roman Catholic
          princes. Thus he was largely instrumental in the failure of the
          Regensburg conference of 1541, where his attitude toward the
          emperor was as fearless as it was narrow. In the same year the
          Elector John Frederick appointed him bishop of Naumburg-Zeitz
          against the wishes of the chapter and in spite of the protest of
          the emperor. The battle of Mühlberg (1547) compelled him to seek
          refuge in Weimar. His quarrel with Melanchthon and his
          supporters had grown embittered with time, and he helped to
          found a new university at Jena in opposition to the tendencies
          represented at Wittenberg. In the same spirit he assumed charge
          of the Jena edition of Luther's works, which was to correct the
          alleged faults and omissions of the Wittenberg edition.

          In 1552 Amsdorf was made superintendent at Eisenach, whence,
          with Flacius, whom he caused to be called to Jena, he carried on
          a virulent polemic against the so-called Philippists and
          Adiaphorists. The formal break between the orthodox Lutheran
          party and the followers of Melanchthon at the colloquy of Worms
          in 1557 was largely due to Amsdorf's efforts. From 1554 to 1559
          he was engaged in a violent controversy with Justus Menius,
          superintendent at Gotha, concerning the doctrine of good works
          as essential to salvation; and in the stress of conflict he was
          led to assume the extreme position that good works are actually
          detrimental to the welfare of the soul, denoting by "good
          works," however, those that man performs for the express purpose
          of attaining salvation. When, in 1561, as a result of his views
          on the doctrine of sin, Flacius, together with his followers,
          was expelled from Jena, Amsdorf was spared because of his
          advanced age and his great services to the Protestant cause in
          the early days of the Reformation.

   Amulet
          AMULET, am´yu-let: A word first used to designate objects having
          a magical effect in warding off or driving away evils--the evil
          eye, illness, demons, etc.--and thus practically equivalent to
          "talisman." By degrees it came to be employed for objects worn
          about the person. Used down to the seventeenth century for
          things forbidden by the Church, it gradually acquired a more
          general meaning. The limits of this article preclude the
          discussion of the origin of amulets, of their psychological
          basis, or of their significance in the universal history of
          religion.

  In the Old Testament and Judaism.

          In the Old Testament, objects of the kind are mentioned among
          the ornaments worn by women (Isa. iii. 16-26) and by animals
          (Judges viii. 21); the bells on the border of the high priest's
          robe had no other primary significance (cf. "the bells of the
          horses," Zech. xiv. 20). Later Judaism completely surrounded the
          individual with intangible spirits, but provided numerous means
          of protection against the evil they might effect--the presence
          of angels, pronouncing the name of God, amulets containing the
          Holy Name, and fragments of Scripture worn on the person (the
          "phylacteries" of Matt. xxiii. 5) or fastened to the door-posts
          of houses. The special power over demons attributed to Solomon
          may also be mentioned; formulas of exorcism were referred to
          him, and the possessed were supposed to be healed, on the
          invocation of his name, by the methods prescribed by him.

  In the Early Church.

          The demonological conceptions of Judaism and the magic of the
          East had a very strong influence on the Greco-Roman world.
          Christianity, however, at first rejected these superstitious
          observances, and protested against every accusation of the use
          of magic arts. There came a change with the entrance of the
          pagan multitudes, with their material ideas of religion and
          their need for an external realization of the supernatural. The
          ideas about demons, found in the exorcisms of the second century
          (Origen, Contra Celsum, vi. 39, 40) were generalized, paganized,
          and Judaized. As the ecclesiastical writers abundantly testify
          (see passages quoted in Bingham, Origines, vii. 250), magical
          formulas began to be used again; mysterious objects, inscribed
          with characters often unintelligible, were placed upon the
          bodies of newborn infants and the sick; and Chrysostom (on I
          Cor. vii. 3) warns his hearers against love-philters. The
          teachers of the Church branded all this as actual apostasy from
          the faith; and the Christian civil government punished severely
          the use of amulets in sickness. To meet this tendency an attempt
          was made to give these methods a Christian coloring, or to
          employ elements susceptible to a Christian interpretation. The
          demons, who had been supposed to have special care of races or
          of individuals, now became angels, and protection was afforded
          by their names inscribed on amulets. In like manner the name of
          God was used. Even some of the clergy provided such amulets,
          though the Church forbade them to do so, and excommunicated
          those who wore them (Synod of Laodicea; Synod of Agde, 544). The
          cross (see [304]Cross and its Use as a Symbol, § 3) took a
          specially prominent place among these protecting objects. Women
          and children commonly wore verses from the Gospels for this
          purpose. Chrysostom told the people of Antioch that they ought
          rather to have the Gospels in their hearts. That of John was
          thought to be particularly efficacious; it was laid on the head
          to drive out fever, and Augustine commends the practise
          (Tractatus vi in cap. i. Johannis evangelii, MPL, xxv. 1443),
          "not because it is done for this purpose," but because it means
          the abandonment of the pagan ligatures. The whole range of
          sacred things was brought into service. Satyrus, the brother of
          Ambrose, in a shipwreck, hung the eucharistic bread, wrapped in
          an orarium about his neck "that he might get help from his
          faith" (Ambrose, De obitu fratris, xliii.). Similar use was made
          of oil and wax from holy places and of water and salt that had
          been blessed. Relics of the saints, enclosed in costly cases,
          were worn. Since the Church was unable entirely and all at once
          to drive out every vestige of heathen superstition, it did the
          next best thing when it took into consideration the needs of
          popular, unspiritual devotion, and gradually, by the conversion
          of the old means, forced into the background or effaced their
          non-Christian elements.

  Survivals.

          Lack of space forbids the discussion in detail of the
          diversified forms even of Christian development of the idea, as
          they are found in the numerous relics of antiquity, from those
          of the catacombs down, or to give any account of the
          multiplicity of objects which are commonly used among the devout
          Roman Catholics at the present day, with at least some remnant
          of the idea of the ancient amulets underlying them--scapulars,
          crosses, the agnus dei, rosaries, and an endless variety of
          medals with pictures of the Virgin and the saints. These objects
          may serve different purposes; they may be tokens of sharing in a
          wide-spread and approved devotion, or signs of membership in
          some pious confraternity, or souvenirs of a visit to some holy
          place; but in most instances the priestly blessing which they
          have received is distinctly understood to give them a positive
          power (on condition of the proper faith and other dispositions
          on the part of the wearer or possessor) against the assaults of
          evil spirits and other ills.

   Amyraut, Moise
          AMYRAUT, am´´î-rO´, MOÏSE (Lat. Moses Amyraldus): Calvinist
          theologian and preacher; b. at Bourgueil (27 m. w.s.w. of
          Tours), Touraine, 1596; d. at Saumur Jan. 8, 1664. He came of an
          influential family in Orleans, began the study of law at
          Poitiers, and received the degree of licentiate in 1616; but the
          reading of Calvin's Institutio turned his mind to theology. This
          he studied eagerly at Saumur, under Cameron, to whom he was much
          attached. After serving as pastor for a short time at
          Saint-Aignan, he was called in 1626 to succeed Jean Daillé at
          Saumur, and soon became prominent. The national synod held at
          Charenton in 1631 chose him to lay its requests before Louis
          XIII., on which occasion his tactful bearing attracted the
          attention and won the respect of Richelieu. In 1633 he was
          appointed professor of theology at Saumur with De la Place and
          Cappel, and the three raised the institution into a flourishing
          condition, students being attracted to it from foreign
          countries, especially from Switzerland. Theological novelties in
          their teaching, however, soon stirred up opposition, which came
          to little in France; but in Switzerland, where the professors
          were less known, it reached such a pitch that students were
          withdrawn, and in 1675 the Helvetic Consensus was drawn up
          against the Saumur innovations. Amyraut was specially attacked
          because his teaching on grace and predestination seemed to
          depart from that of the Synod of Dort, by adding a conditional
          universal grace to the unconditional particular.

          Amyraut first published his ideas in his Traité de la
          prédestination (Saumur, 1634), which immediately caused great
          excitement. The controversy became so heated that the national
          synod at Alençon in 1637 had to take notice of it. Amyraut and
          his friend Testard were acquitted of heterodoxy, and silence was
          imposed on both sides. The attacks continued, however, and the
          question came again before the synod of Charenton in 1644-45,
          but with the same result. Amyraut bore himself so well under all
          these assaults that he succeeded in conciliating many of his
          opponents, even the venerable Du Moulin (1655). But at the synod
          of Loudun in 1659 (the last for which permission was
          obtained--partly through Amyraut's influence--from the crown),
          fresh accusations were brought, this time including Daillé, the
          president of the synod, because he had defended what is called
          "Amyraldism." This very synod, however, gave Amyraut the
          honorable commission to revise the order of discipline. In
          France the harmlessness of his teaching was generally
          recognized; and the controversy would soon have died out but for
          the continual agitation kept up abroad, especially in Holland
          and Switzerland.

          Amyraut's doctrine has been called "hypothetical universalism";
          but the term is misleading, since it might be applied also to
          the Arminianism which he steadfastly opposed. His main
          proposition is this: God wills all men to be saved, on condition
          that they believe--a condition which they could well fulfil in
          the abstract, but which in fact, owing to inherited corruption,
          they stubbornly reject, so that this universal will for
          salvation actually saves no one. God also wills in particular to
          save a certain number of persons, and to pass over the others
          with this grace. The elect will be saved as inevitably as the
          others will be damned. The essential point, then, of Amyraldism
          is the combination of real particularism with a purely ideal
          universalism. Though still believing it as strongly as ever,
          Amyraut came to see that it made little practical difference,
          and did not press it in his last years, devoting himself rather
          to non-controversial studies, especially to his system of
          Christian morals (La morale chrestienne, 6 vols., Saumur,
          1652-60). The read significance of Amyraut's teaching lies in
          the fact that, while leaving unchanged the special doctrines of
          Calvinism, he brought to the front its ethical message and its
          points of universal human interest. See [306]Calvinism.

          The name "Anabaptists" (meaning "Rebaptizers") was given by
          their opponents to a party among the Protestants in Reformation
          times whose distinguishing tenet was opposition to infant
          baptism, which they held to be unscriptural and therefore not
          true baptism. They baptized all who joined them; but, according
          to their belief, this was not a rebaptism as their opponents
          charged. In opposition to the Church doctrine they held that
          baptism should be administered only to those who were old enough
          to express by means of it their acceptance of the Christian
          faith, and hence, from their point of view, their converts were
          really baptized for the first time. Another epithet often
          applied to them was "Catabaptists," meaning pseudobaptists, as
          if their baptism were a mockery, and with an implication of
          drowning, which was considered the appropriate punishment for
          their conduct and frequently followed their arrest.

          In studying this movement the following facts should be borne in
          mind: (1) The Anabaptists did not invent their rejection of
          infant baptism, for there have always been parties in the Church
          which were antipedobaptists (cf. A. H. Newman, History of
          Antipedobaptism, Philadelphia, 1897). (2) There are two kinds of
          Anabaptists, the sober and the fanatical. Failure to make this
          distinction has done mischief and caused modern Baptists to deny
          their connection with the Baptists of the Reformation, whereas
          they are the lineal descendants of the sober kind and have no
          reason to be ashamed of their predecessors. (3) Even among the
          fanatical Anabaptists there were harmless dreamers; not all the
          fanatics were ready to establish a Kingdom of the Saints by
          unsaintly deeds. (4) Information concerning the Anabaptists is
          largely derived from prejudiced and deficient sources.

I. The Sober Anabaptists:

  1. In Switzerland.

          These were the product of the Reformation in Switzerland started
          by Zwingli. Shortly after he began to preach Reformation
          doctrine in Zurich, in 1519, some of his hearers, very humble
          persons mostly, gathered in private houses to discuss his
          sermons, and Zwingli often met with them. He had laid it down as
          a principle that what is not taught in the Bible is not a law of
          God for Christians, and had applied this principle to the
          payment of tithes and the observance of Lent. In 1522 these
          friends of Zwingli asked him where he found his plain Scripture
          authorizing infant baptism and whether, according to his
          principle he was not compelled to give it up. Zwingli, however,
          though he wavered at first, decided to stand by the Church,
          arguing that there was fair inferential support in the Bible for
          the practise, and that it was the Christian substitute for the
          Jewish rite of circumcision. Over this point an estrangement
          took place between him and his parishioners. The little company
          received accessions of a desirable character, and came to
          include scholars and theologians like Felix Manz and Conrad
          Grebel, who socially and intellectually were the peers of
          Zwingli's followers. Hübmaier was a visitor. In 1524 as the
          result of letters or visits from Thomas Münzer and Andreas
          Carlstadt they took very decided antipedobaptist positions; but
          public opinion in Zurich was against them, and the magistrates
          on Jan. 18, 1525, after what was considered the victory of the
          Church party in a public debate, following many private
          conferences, ordered that these antipedobaptists present their
          children for baptism, and made it a law that any parents
          refusing to have their infant children baptized should be
          banished. On Jan. 21 they forbade the meetings of the
          antipedobaptists and banished all foreigners who advocated their
          views. Shortly after this the antipedobaptists began to practise
          believers' baptism. In a company composed entirely of laymen one
          poured water in the name of the Trinity on other members in
          succession, after they had expressed a desire to be baptized,
          and so, as they claimed, they instituted veritable Christian
          baptism. Like scenes were enacted in other assemblies. It is
          noteworthy that these first believers' baptisms were by pouring;
          immersion was introduced later. Also that in all the lengthy
          treatises of Zwingli on baptism there is no discussion as to the
          mode. These early Baptists practised pouring, sprinkling, and
          immersion as suited their convenience, and did not consider the
          mode as of much importance.

  2. Anabaptist Tenets.

          Though infant baptism was the first and the main issue between
          the Anabaptists and the Church party, there were others of great
          importance. The former said that only those who had been
          baptized after confession of faith in Christ constituted a real
          Church; the latter, that all baptized persons living in a
          certain district constituted the State Church. The Anabaptists
          maintained that there should be a separation between the State
          and the Church; that no Christian should bear arms, take an
          oath, or hold public office; that there should be complete
          religious liberty. All this was not in accord with the times;
          and thus the Anabaptists were considered to be enemies of the
          standing order, and were treated accordingly. On Sept. 9, 1527,
          the cantons of Zurich, Bern, and St. Gall united in an edict
          which may be taken as a specimen of its class. It gives reasons
          for prosecuting the Anabaptists, which are manifestly prejudiced
          and even in part false, and then decrees the death by drowning
          of all of them who are teachers, baptizing preachers,
          itinerants, leaders of conventicles, or who had once recanted
          and then relapsed. Foreigners in these cantons associating with
          the Anabaptists were banished, and if found again were to be
          drowned. Simple adherents were to be fined. It was made the
          bounden duty of all good citizens to inform against the
          Anabaptists (for the full text consult S. M. Jackson, Huldreich
          Zwingli, New York, 1903, pp. 259-281). Similar laws against the
          Anabaptists were made and enforced in South Germany, Austria,
          the Tyrol, the Netherlands, England, and wherever they went.
          Such treatment suppressed Anabaptism, or at all events, drove it
          beneath the surface. How ineffectual it was to extinguish it
          appears from the fact that early in 1537, four Anabaptists from
          the Netherlands quietly stole into Geneva, and began making
          converts. John Calvin, who neglected no opportunity to do God
          service, as he conceived it, got wind of their presence and had
          them and their seven converts banished by the magistrates (the
          incident is described by Beza in his life of Calvin, ed.
          Neander, p. 8; cf. Calvin's Tracts, Eng. transl., i. xxx.;
          Doumergue, Jean Calvin, ii. 242; Herminjard, Correspondance des
          Réformateurs, iv. 272). Anabaptists persisted in great numbers
          in Moravia, the Palatinate, Switzerland, Poland, and elsewhere.

  3. In the Netherlands and England.

          Only in the Netherlands did the Anabaptists escape persecution,
          and there they became quite numerous. They were joined in 1538
          by a remarkable man, [307]Menno Simons, who organized them and
          his name has been given to the sect (see [308]Mennonites). From
          the Netherlands they passed into England; but no sooner did they
          make converts there than Henry VIII. included them in a decree
          of banishment, and those who remained he threatened to put to
          death. Indeed, in 1535 there is record of ten persons who were
          burned in London and other English towns on the charge of
          Anabaptism (cf. John Foxe, Acts and Monuments, ed. Townsend, v.,
          London, 1843, p. 44). How little this cruel course succeeded is
          evidenced by the continued presence in England of the Baptist
          Church.

          That among the sober kind of Anabaptists there were unworthy
          persons, that some of them held visionary views, and that a few
          may have been goaded into occasional violence of expression, and
          possibly of conduct, may be accepted as proved; but that they
          were as a party guilty of the charges brought against them, as
          in the joint edict mentioned above, is untrue. As a class they
          were as holy in life as their persecutors; and their leaders, in
          Biblical knowledge and theological acumen, were no mean
          antagonists.

II. The Fanatical Anabaptists:

  1. The Zwickau Prophets.

          The earliest mention of Anabaptism in connection with the
          Lutheran Reformation is in the spring of 1521 when Niklaus
          Storch, Markus Stübner, and a third person, who was a weaver, as
          Storch had been, made their appearance in Wittenberg and sought
          to convert the professors of its university to their views,
          which were the familiar Anabaptist ones of opposition to
          military service, private property, government by those not true
          Christians, infant baptism, and the oath, together with the
          novel one that there should be a dissolution of the marriage
          bond in the cases where there was not agreement between the
          married couple in religious belief. These views they pressed
          with great vehemence and no little success. They also claimed to
          be inspired to make their deliverances. As they came from
          Zwickau, they are called the [309]Zwickau Prophets. Carlstadt
          was impressed by them, and characteristically allowed
          iconoclastic practises in his church. Melanchthon wavered, but
          Luther, who at the time of their visit was at the Wartburg, was
          so much stirred by the confusion they induced that he left his
          seclusion and opposed them stoutly and silenced them by ridicule
          rather than by arguments.

  2. In Strasburg and Münster.

          Among the leaders and followers on the peasant side in the
          Peasants' war which desolated Germany in 1525, were those who
          held antipedobaptist views. After the war Strasburg became the
          center of the Anabaptists and, after 1529, when it was visited
          by [310]Melchior Hoffmann, "the evil genius of the Anabaptists,"
          it was the center of their propaganda. Hoffmann united to the
          usual Anabaptist views, belief in himself as the inspired
          interpreter of prophecy and as inspired leader generally. He
          declared that he was one of the "two witnesses" of Rev. xi. 3;
          that Strasburg was to be the New Jerusalem, and the seat of
          universal dominion; and that non-resistance might be given up.
          These views he preached with great effect through East Friesland
          and the Netherlands, and his followers called themselves
          "Melchiorites." After he had been thrown into prison (1533) Jan
          Matthys, a baker from Haarlem, appeared in Strasburg and claimed
          to be the other "witness" of the Apocalypse; but he altered the
          programme by transferring the capital of the kingdom of the
          saints to Münster, and advocating force in maintaining it. After
          sending four apostles, one of whom was the notorious John of
          Leyden, he came thither himself (Feb., 1535), and led a
          successful revolt against the magistracy and bishop of the city.
          In Apr., 1535 he was killed and was succeeded by John of Leyden
          who caused himself to be proclaimed king, and declared polygamy
          to be the law of the kingdom. Meanwhile the city was besieged by
          the expelled bishop aided by the neighboring princes and by the
          imperial troops. If half that is said to have gone on within the
          city be true (the reports come from very prejudiced sources),
          fanaticism was there the order of the day. Hence the defense was
          lax, owing to dependence on divine power to work deliverance.
          Nevertheless, the siege lasted many months, and treachery within
          rather than assaults without at last opened the gates on June
          25, 1535 (see [311]Münster, Anabaptists In). The fanatical
          Anabaptists were universally taken as typical, and to this day
          when Anabaptism is mentioned it is supposed to be the equivalent
          of absurd interpretation of Scripture, blasphemous assumption,
          and riotous indecency. Münster was, however, only the
          culminating point of fanaticism engendered by persecution, and
          Anabaptism in itself, strictly interpreted, is not responsible
          for it.

   Anacletus
          ANACLETUS, an´´a klî´tus: The name of one pope and one antipope.

          Anacletus I.: Roman presbyter at the close of the first century.
          The hypothesis of Volkmar, that he had no historical existence
          is opposed by the prevailing unanimity of the Greek and Latin
          lists of the popes. These differ, however, in the place which
          they ascribe to him, some naming him fourth and some third. The
          latter is the older order. As the name in Greek is sometimes
          written Anenkletos and sometimes Kletos, the Catalogus
          Liberianus and other early authorities were betrayed into the
          mistake of making two distinct persons. It is impossible to
          determine his date. Twelve years is the longest time assigned to
          his pontificate. The assertion, that he, as well as Linus and
          Clemens, was consecrated by St. Peter, sprang from the tendency
          to connect him as closely as possible with the beginnings of the
          Church. That he met a martyr's death under Domitian, or, as
          Baronius and Hausrath assert, under Trajan, can not be
          adequately demonstrated. His festival in the Roman Catholic
          Church falls on July 13.

          Anacletus II. (Pietro Pierleoni): Antipope, 1130-38. He was
          descended from a Jewish family which had grown rich and powerful
          under Gregory VII, studied in Paris, and later became a Cluniac
          monk. Paschal II. recalled him to Rome, and in 1116 made him a
          cardinal. He accompanied Gelasius II. on his flight to France,
          and after his death took a leading part in the elevation of
          Calixtus II., who made him legate to England and France in 1121,
          and, conjointly with Cardinal Gregory, who was to be his rival
          for the papacy, to France in 1122. It is impossible to determine
          how far the description of him as an immoral and avaricious
          prelate is based on the enmity of his later opponents; but it is
          certain that even under Paschal II. he was already laying his
          plans to be made pope. On February 14, 1130, he attained his aim
          so far as to be chosen by a majority of the cardinals, though
          not to be enthroned before nine of them had elected Gregorio
          Papareschi as Innocent II. Anacletus used both his own resources
          and those of the Church to win over the Romans, and Innocent was
          obliged to flee. In September, 1130, Anacletus allied himself
          with Roger of Sicily, and thus made a decided enemy of Lothair
          the Saxon, who was already inclined to support Innocent, and
          now, with England and France, declared for him. In Oct., 1131,
          Innocent excommunicated Anacletus at Reims; in the following
          spring he set out for Italy; and in Apr., 1133, entering Rome in
          Lothair's company, he took possession of the Lateran, while
          Anacletus held the Vatican. Lothair pronounced the latter an
          outlaw and a criminal against both the divine and the royal
          majesty; but he was himself forced to leave Rome in June, and
          Anacletus forced Innocent once more to flee to Pisa. In the
          autumn of 1136 Lothair returned, and succeeded in compelling
          southern Italy to recognize Innocent. The end of the schism was,
          however, due less to him than to Bernard of Clairvaux, who
          succeeded in separating not only the city of Milan, but many of
          the principal Romans from Anacletus's party (see [314]Bernard,
          Saint, of Clairvaux). Negotiations were even opened with Roger
          of Sicily, his last supporter; but at this juncture Anacletus
          died, Jan. 25, 1138. His letters and privileges are in MPL,
          clxxix. 689-732, and in Jaffé, Regesta, i. 911-919.

   Anammelech
          ANAMMELECH, ?-nam´e´lec or a´´nam´´mê´lec: According to II Kings
          xvii. 31, a deity worshiped with child-sacrifice by the
          Sepharvites who were settled in Samaria by Sargon (see
          [316]Adrammelech). If Sepharvaim be sought in Babylonia, it is
          natural to refer the name "Anammelech" to the Babylonian god Anu
          (Anu-malik or Anu-malku, "King Anu"; cf. Jensen, pp. 272 sqq.;
          Schrader, p. 353; Bæthgen, pp. 254-255). If, however, as is more
          probable, Sepharvaim was a city of Syria, the Babylonian
          derivation is untenable. The name of a goddess Anath is found in
          a Greco-Phenician inscription (CIS, i. 95) of Lapithos in Cyprus
          belonging to the time of Ptolemy I. Soter (d. 283 B.C.). It
          occurs also on a Phenician coin with a picture of the goddess
          riding upon a lion, and a star above her head. The name "Anath"
          appears in the Old Testament towns Beth-anath (in Naphtali,
          Josh. xix. 38; Judges i. 33) and Beth-anoth (in Judah, Josh. xv.
          59); also in the proper name "Anath" (Judges iii. 31, v. 6), and
          perhaps in the town Anathoth near Jerusalem. It is not
          impossible that the passage in II Kings is corrupt, and
          "Anammelech" may be merely a variant of "Adrammelech." It is
          wanting in Lucian's text of the Septuagint.

   Ananias
          ANANIAS, an´´-?-n?i´?s: The high priest in whose time the
          apostle Paul was imprisoned at Jerusalem (probably 58 A.D.; Acts
          xxiii. 2, xxiv. 1). In the Lucan description of the conflict
          between Paul and Palestinian Judaism (xxi.-xxvi.; cf. K.
          Schmidt, Apostelgeschichte, i., Erlangen, 1882, pp. 240 sqq.),
          Ananias is represented as head of the Sadducaic hierarchical
          party which was dominant in the Sanhedrin, and confirmed its
          complete apostasy from the hope of Israel by persecution of the
          apostle of Christ, whereas the apostle deposes and divests of
          its divine authority and dignity the leadership which had become
          faithless to its calling. According to Josephus (Ant., XX. v. 2,
          vi. 2, ix. 2-4; War, II. xii. 6, xvii. 6, 9), Ananias, son of
          Nebedæus, was appointed high priest about 47 A.D. by Herod of
          Chalcis (the twentieth in the succession of high priests from
          the accession of Herod the Great to the destruction of
          Jerusalem). In the year 52 he had to go to Rome to defend
          himself before Claudius against a charge made by the Samaritans
          against the Jews. He was not deposed at this time, however (cf.
          C. Wieseler, Chronologische Synopse der vier Evangelien,
          Hamburg, 1843, pp. 187-188), but held his office until Agrippa
          II. appointed Ishmael, son of Phabi, his successor, probably in
          59 A.D. Ananias is the only high priest after Caiaphas who ruled
          for any length of time. He exercised considerable influence
          after leaving his office until he was murdered in the beginning
          of the Jewish war.

   Anaphora
          ANAPHORA, ?n-af´o-r?: Name used in the Eastern liturgies for the
          later or more sacred part of the eucharistic service, answering
          to the Missa fidelium of the early times, from which the
          catechumens were excluded, and in the main to the canon of the

          prayers, after the "greater entrance" or solemn oblation of the
          elements on the altar.

   Anastasius
          ANASTASIUS: Of the many bearers of this name in the Eastern
          Church the following three are specially deserving of notice:

          1. Anastasius I: Patriarch of Antioch, 559-599. He was a friend
          of Gregory I., and strongly opposed Justinian's later church
          policy, which favored the Aphthartodocetæ (see [317]Julian of
          Halicarnassus; [318]Justinian; [319]Monophysites). He was
          banished in 570 by Justin II., was recalled in 593 by Maurice,
          and died in 599. His day is Apr. 21. Of his writings there have
          been printed: (1) Five addresses on true dogmas; (2) four
          sermons (of doubtful genuineness); (3) "A Brief Exposition of
          the Orthodox Faith" (in Greek); (4) fragments; (5) an oration
          delivered Mar. 25, 593, when he resumed the patriarchal chair.

          2. Anastasius II: Patriarch of Antioch, 599-609, in which year
          he was murdered by Antiochian Jews. His day is Dec. 21. He
          translated the Cura pastoralis of Gregory I.

          3. Anastasius Sinaita: Priest, monk, and abbot of Mount Sinai;
          b. before 640; d. after 700. He defended ecclesiastical theology
          against heretics and Jews, and composed various works which have
          not been fully collected and examined. They include: (1) A
          "Guide" in defense of the faith of the Church against the many
          forms of Monophysitism; (2) "Questions and Answers by Different
          Persons on Different Topics"; (3) "A Discourse on the Holy
          Communion"; (4) anagogic observations on the six days of
          creation; (5) a discourse and homilies on the sixth Psalm; (6)
          two discourses on the creation of man in the image of God; (7) a
          fragment against Arianism; (8) a list of heresies; (9) "A Short
          and Clear Exposition of our Faith"; (10) a treatise on the
          celebration of Wednesday and Friday; (11) a fragment on
          blasphemy. The "Argument against the Jews" (MPG, lxxxix.1208-82)
          is not earlier than the ninth century; the Antiquorum patrum
          doctrina de verbi incarnatione (ed. Mai, Nova collectio, vii. 1,
          6-73), however, appears to be genuine.

   Anastasius
          ANASTASIUS, an´´?s-tê´shi-us or zhus: The name of four popes and
          one antipope.

          Anastasius I.: Pope 398-401. According to the Liber pontificalis
          (ed. Duchesne, i. 218-219), he was a Roman by birth, was elected
          near the end of November or early in December, 398, and was
          pontiff three years and ten days. He is principally known for
          the part he took in the controversy over the teaching of Origen.
          He showed himself also a rigid upholder of the orthodox position
          against the Donatists. At the synod held in Carthage Sept. 13,
          401, a letter was read from him exhorting the African bishops to
          expose the misrepresentations of the Donatists against the
          Church, and practically to hand them over to the secular arm.
          His letters and decrees are in MPL, xx. 51-80. See
          [320]Origenistic Controversies.

          Anastasius II.: Pope 496-498. According to the Liber
          pontificalis (ed. Duchesne, i. 258-259), be was a Roman by
          birth. He was consecrated apparently on Nov. 24, 496. His
          pontificate fell within the period of the schism between the
          East and West, which lasted from 484 to 519, as a consequence of
          the sentence of excommunication pronounced by Pope Felix II.
          against Acacias, patriarch of Constantinople. Anastasius
          endeavored to restore communion with Constantinople, sending two
          bishops immediately after his consecration with a letter to the
          Eastern emperor offering to recognize the orders conferred by
          Acacias (who was now dead), at the same time asserting the
          justice of his condemnation. The Liber pontificalis (l.c.)
          relates that upon the arrival in Rome of the deacon Photinus of
          Thessalonica, Anastasius communicated with him, though he
          maintained the orthodoxy of Acacias and was thus, according to
          the Roman view, a heretic. This seems to have aroused opposition
          among the Roman clergy, and a suspicion arose that the pope
          intended to reverse the decision against Acacias. In the
          Decretum of Gratian he is said to have been "repudiated by the
          Roman Church" (MPL, clxxxvii. 111), and hence ecclesiastical
          writers as late as the sixteenth century usually regard him as a
          heretic. The baptism of Clovis, king of the Franks, fell at the
          beginning of his pontificate, but the letter of congratulation
          which the pope is supposed to have written to him is a forgery.
          He died in November, 498.

          Anastasius III.: Pope 911-913. He was a Roman by birth. His
          pontificate fell in the period during which Rome and its Church
          were under the domination of the noble factions, and
          consequently little is known of his acts. Nicholas, patriarch of
          Constantinople, protested to him against the toleration by the
          legates of his predecessor, Sergius III., of the fourth marriage
          of the Eastern emperor, Leo VI. Before Anastasius could answer
          this letter, he died, probably in August, 913. Two privileges
          ascribed to him, one genuine, one spurious, are in MPL, cxxxi.

          Anastasius IV. (Conrad of Suburra): Pope 1153-54. He had been a
          canon regular and abbot of St. Rufus in the diocese of Orléans,
          and was made cardinal-bishop of Sabina by Honorius II. After the
          contested election of 1130, he had taken his stand as one of the
          most determined opponents of Anacletus II. He remained in Rome
          as the vicar of Innocent II. when the latter fled to France, and
          on the death of Eugenius III. (July 5, 1153), was elected to
          succeed him. In his short reign he ended the controversy with
          Frederick Barbarossa over the title to the archiepiscopal see of
          Magdeburg, recognizing Wichmann of Naumburg, which Eugenius III.
          had refused to do. The decision was looked upon in Germany as a
          victory for the emperor. Another long-standing dispute in
          England was terminated by Anastasius's final recognition of
          Archbishop William of York, who had been rejected by Innocent
          II. and Celestine II., had been confirmed by Lucius II., and had
          again been deposed by Eugenius III. He died Dec. 3, 1154, and
          was succeeded on the following day by the English cardinal
          Nicholas Breakspear as Adrian IV. His letters and privileges are
          in MPL, clxxxviii.

          Anastasius: Antipope 855. As cardinal-priest of St. Marcellus,
          in Rome, he had been in decided opposition to Pope Leo IV., and
          from 848 to 850 had been obliged to absent himself from that
          city. After twice inviting him to appear before a synod, Leo
          finally excommunicated him (Dec. 16, 850), and pronounced a
          still more solemn anathema against him at Ravenna (May 29, 853),
          repeating it in a council at Rome (June 19), and deposing him
          from his priestly functions (Dec. 8). Anastasius, however,
          relied on his wealth and his connections in Rome, and aspired to
          be elected pope on the death of Leo. Leo died on July 17, 855,
          and the Roman clergy at once chose Benedict III. to succeed him.
          Anastasius set himself up as a rival candidate. Accompanied by
          some friendly bishops and influential Romans, he intercepted the
          imperial ambassadors on their way to Rome, and won them over to
          his side. On Sept. 21 he forced his way into the Lateran,
          dragged Benedict from his throne, stripped him of his pontifical
          robes, and finally threw him into prison. These proceedings,
          however, caused great indignation in Rome. Not only almost all
          the clergy, but also the populace sided with Benedict, who was
          liberated and consecrated (Sept. 29) in St. Peter's.
          Hergenröther identifies Anastasius with the librarian of the
          Roman Church of the same name (see [321]Anastasius
          Bibliothecarius), but this seems doubtful. The antipope relied
          on secular assistance, while the author was a convinced adherent
          of the strict ecclesiastical party.

   Anastasius Bibliothecarius
          ANASTASIUS BIBLIOTHECARIUS: One of the few important men among
          the Roman clergy in the middle of the ninth century; d. 879. He
          grew up in Rome, and inherited from his uncle Arsenius (whose
          visits to the Carolingian courts in 865 had such an important
          influence on the development of the papal power) close relations
          with both the spiritual and secular powers of the day. He was
          for some time abbot of what is now Santa Maria in Trastevere,
          and about the end of 867 Adrian II. made him librarian of the
          Roman church. In 869 Emperor Louis II. sent him to
          Constantinople to arrange the marriage of his daughter Irmengard
          with the eldest son of Basil the Macedonian. Here he attended
          the last session of the eighth ecumenical council; and when the
          acts of the council, entrusted to the Roman legates, were taken
          from them by pirates on the homeward journey, he supplied a copy
          of his own. He seems to have influenced John VIII. in favor of
          his friend Photius. Hincmar of Reims begged his intercession,
          which was successful, with Adrian II. The references in
          Hincmar's writings seem to identify the librarian with the
          cardinal-priest of St. Marcellus who was the iconoclastic
          candidate for the papacy in 855, and was several times
          excommunicated. (On the question of his part in the compilation
          of the Liber Pontificalis see [322]Liber Pontificalis.) His
          Chronographia tripartita is important for its influence on the
          study of general church history in the West. In a rough age,
          when East and West were drifting further asunder, he labored
          zealously to make the fruits of Eastern culture accessible to
          the Latins. Most of his works are in MPL, cxxix.; the
          Chronographia tripartita is in Theophanis chronographia, ed. C.
          de Boor, Leipsic, 1883, pp. 31-34b.

   Anathema
          ANATHEMA, ?-nath´e-m?: Among the Greeks the word anathema
          denoted an object consecrated to a divinity; a use of the word
          which is explained by the custom of hanging or fastening
          (anatithesthai) such objects to trees, pillars, and the like.
          The weaker form anathema was originally used side by side with
          anathema in the same sense. The double form explains the
          frequent variations of manuscripts between the two, which later
          become confusing, since anathema took on a restricted
          signification and was used in a sense exactly opposite to
          anathema. This later usage arose partly from the use of anathema
          in the Septuagint as an equivalent for the Hebrew ?erem, which
          is correct enough according to the root-idea of the Hebrew word;
          but the latter had acquired a special meaning in the religious
          law of the Old Testament, designating not only that which was
          dedicated to God and withdrawn from ordinary use as holy, but
          also and more especially that which was offered to God in
          expiation, to be destroyed. In like manner anathema came to
          denote not only what belonged irrevocably to God, but what was
          abandoned to him for punishment or annihilation. This double
          meaning is explicable by the interrelation of law and religion
          under the old covenant. The declaration of herem recognized
          God's right to exclusive possession of certain things and to the
          annihilation of whatever offended his majesty. Under this law
          booty taken in war was wholly or partly destroyed (Deut. xiii.
          16; Josh. vi. 18, viii. 26), idolatrous peoples were put to
          death, and cities were razed, never to be rebuilt (Josh. vi. 26;
          I Kings xvi. 34). The same double sense of ?erem, anathema, is
          found in the early Greek and Roman law, which has the same
          combination of religious and secular bearing; devotio in one
          aspect is the same as the Greek kathierOsis, in another as
          imprecatio, maledictio, exsecratio.

          In postexilic Israel the herem found a new use as a penal
          measure directed to the maintenance of the internal purity of
          the community. It then denoted the penalty of exclusion or
          excommunication, sometimes with confiscation of property (Ezra
          x. 8). It was developed by the synagogue into two grades, niddui
          (Luke vi. 22; John ix. 22, xii. 42) and herem, which included
          the pronouncing of a curse. It was now an official act with a
          formal ritual. The connection between exclusion and cursing
          explains the use of anathema in the sense of simple cursing
          (Mark xiv. 71) or of binding by a solemn vow (Acts xxiii. 12).
          In the technical sense the word anathema occurs in four passages
          of Paul's epistles, all of which show that he was thinking of a
          definite and recognized conception and a purely spiritual one
          (Rom. ix. 3; I Cor. xii. 3, xvi. 22; Gal. i. 8, 9). The falling
          under this solemn curse is conditioned and justified by the act
          of the subject, in failing to love God or in preaching a false
          gospel. These passages show that Paul was not thinking of
          anathema as a disciplinary measure of the community, as under
          the synagogue; there is no connection between it and the
          penalties inflicted on moral offenders (I Cor. v. 5, 11; I Tim.
          i. 20). It is pronounced only against those who set themselves
          in treasonable opposition to God himself, to his truth and his
          revelation. Paul's use of the word, therefore, goes back of the
          practise of the synagogue to the Septuagint use. This explains
          the fact that in the development of ecclesiastical discipline
          the word "anathema" is not used as a technical term for
          excommunication before the fourth century. It occurs in the
          canons of Elvira (305) against mockers and in those of Laodicea
          (341?) against Judaizers; and after the Council of Chalcedon
          (451) it becomes a fixed formula of excommunication, used
          especially against heretics, as in the anathemas of the Council
          of Trent and later papal utterances. No settled unity of belief
          has, however, been arrived at in regard to it; now absolute
          finality of operation is claimed for it, now it is considered as
          revocable. And there is as little agreement as to its effects,
          the limits of its use, and its position in the scale of
          penalties. Du Cange includes the prevalent conceptions of it
          when he defines it as "excommunication inflicted by bishop or
          council, not amounting quite to the major excommunication, but
          still accompanied by execration and cursing." See
          [323]Excommunication.

   Anatolius of Constantinople
          ANATOLIUS, an´´??-tO´li-us, OF CONSTANTINOPLE: Patriarch of
          Constantinople; d. 458. He belonged to the Alexandrian school,
          was apocrisiarius at Constantinople of [325]Dioscurus of
          Alexandria, and succeeded Flavian as patriarch after the "Robber
          Synod" of Ephesus (449). It was a time of conflict, and
          Anatolius was more than once accused of heresy, ambition, and
          injustice. At the Council of Chalcedon (451) he succeeded in
          having reaffirmed a canon of the second general council
          (Constantinople, 381) which placed Constantinople on an equal
          footing with Rome. He crowned the emperor Leo I. in 457, which
          is said by Gibbon (chap. xxxvi.) to be the first instance of the
          performance of such a ceremony by an ecclesiastic. Anatolius is
          identified by John Mason Neale (Hymns of the Eastern Church,
          London, 1862) with the author of the hymns (in Neale's
          translation) Fierce was the wild billow, and The day is past and
          over. Others think that Anatolius the hymn-writer lived at a
          later time.

   Anatolius of Laodicea
          ANATOLIUS OF LAODICEA: Bishop of Laodicea in the third century.
          He was a native of Alexandria, and excelled in rhetoric and
          philosophy, the natural sciences, and mathematics. His fellow
          citizens requested him to establish a school of Aristotelian
          Philosophy. In 262 he left Alexandria, acted for a time as
          coadjutor of Bishop Theotecnus of Cæsarea, and was made bishop
          of Laodicea in 268 or 269. Eusebius (Hist. eccl., VII. xxxii.
          14-20) gives a considerable extract from a work of his on the
          paschal festival, and mentions another, in ten books, on
          calculation. The Latin Liber Anatoli de ratione paschali
          probably belongs to the sixth century. It is in MPG, x., and in
          B. Krusch, Studien zur mittelälterlichen Chronologie, Leipsic,
          1880, pp. 311-327; cf. ANF, vi. 146-153.

   Anchieta, Jose de
          ANCHIETA, ??n´´shî-ê´t?, JOSÉ DE: The apostle of Brazil; b. at
          La Laguna, Teneriffe, Canary Islands, 1533; d. at Retirygba,
          Brazil, June 15, 1597. He joined the Jesuits in 1550, and three
          years later went to Brazil. In 1567 he was ordained priest, and
          thenceforth lived as missionary in the wild interior, laboring
          amid great hardships for the conversion of the savages. He
          became provincial before his death. Both the Indians and the
          Portuguese believed that he worked miracles. He wrote two
          catechisms in the native Brazilian tongue, a dictionary of the
          same, and a grammar (Arte de grammatica da lingoa mais usada na
          costa do Brasil, Coimbra, 1595), which is the standard work on
          the subject. A treatise by him in Latin on the natural products
          of Brazil was published by the Academy of Sciences at Lisbon
          (1812).

          themselves in solitude to the service of God and the care of
          their souls, practically synonymous with hermit. See

   Ancillon
          ANCILLON, ??n-sî´y?n: Name of an old Huguenot family of France,
          one of whose members resigned a high judicial position in the
          sixteenth century for the sake of his faith. His son, Georges
          Ancillon, was one of the founders of the Evangelical Church of
          Metz. Other members of the family were the following:

          David Ancillon: Great-grandson of Georges Ancillon; b. at Metz
          Mar. 17, 1617; d. at Berlin Sept. 3, 1692. He attended the
          Jesuit college of his native city, studied theology at Geneva
          (1633-41), and was appointed preacher at Meaux (1641) and Metz
          (1653). In 1657 he held a conference on the traditions of the
          Church with Dr. Bédaciar, suffragan of the bishop of Metz; and,
          as a false report of this conference was spread by a monk, he
          published his celebrated Traité de la Tradition (Sedan, 1657).
          At the revocation of the edict of Nantes he went to Frankfort
          and became pastor at Hanau (1685), where he wrote an apology of
          Luther, Zwingli, Calvin, and Beza. Later he went to Berlin,
          where the Elector Frederick William appointed him preacher to
          the French congregation. The Vie de Farel, which appeared at
          Amsterdam in 1691 under his name, is a mutilated copy of a
          manuscript which he had not intended for publication.

          Charles Ancillon: Eldest son of David Ancillon; b. at Metz July
          28, 1659; d. in Berlin July 5, 1715. He was judge and director
          of the French colony in Brandenburg and historiographer to
          Frederick I. Of his writings the following have interest for the
          Church historian: Réflexions politiques (Cologne, 1685);
          Irrévocabilité de l'édit de Nantes (Amsterdam, 1688); Histoire
          de l'établissement des Français réfugiés dans les états de
          Brandebourg (Berlin, 1690). He published also Mélange critique
          de littérature (3 vols., Basel, 1698), based upon conversations
          with his father, and containing an account of his life.

          Jean Pierre Frédéric Ancillon: Great-grandson of Charles
          Ancillon; b. in Berlin Apr. 30, 1767; d. there Apr. 19, 1837. He
          was teacher in the military academy of Berlin and preacher to
          the French congregation, his sermons attracting much attention.
          In 1806 he was appointed tutor to the crown prince, and in 1825
          minister of state, which position he retained till his death. He
          published two volumes of sermons (Berlin, 1818).

   Ancyra, Synod of
          ANCYRA, an-s?i´ra SYNOD OF: A council held at Ancyra (the modern
          Angora, 215 m. e.s.e. of Constantinople), a considerable town in
          the center of Galatia. The year is not stated, but it was
          probably soon after the downfall of Maximinus had freed the
          Eastern Church from persecution, presumably in 314. Nine canons
          of the synod deal with the treatment of the lapsed. The tenth
          permits deacons to marry if they have expressed such an
          intention at their ordination. The thirteenth forbids
          chorepiscopi to ordain priests and deacons. From the eighteenth
          canon it may be inferred that the episcopate of Asia Minor was
          inclined to appoint bishops without regard to the right of
          election on the part of the people, and that the latter
          frequently succeeded in opposing such appointments; it also
          provides that bishops named for any church but not received by
          it must remain members of the presbytery to which they had
          belonged, and not seek an opportunity to exercise episcopal
          jurisdiction elsewhere.

          he filled till 1866, resigning then because he was convinced
          that the age of seventy years constitutes "a limit beyond which
          it would not be wise to remain in so arduous a position." He
          visited officially the missions of the Board in the
          Mediterranean 1828-29 and again in 1843-44, in India 1854-55,
          and in the Sandwich Islands 1863. His published works include:

          Washington Square, New York (1895-98), and Highland Avenue
          Church, Ossining, N. Y. (1899-1904). He was recording secretary
          of the Board of Education of the Methodist Episcopal Church from
          1898 to 1904, when he was elected corresponding secretary. In
          1898 he was made a member of the Board of Managers of the

          de Oleiros, Alemtejo, Portugal, about 1580; d. at Goa Mar. 16,
          1634. He went to the missions in the East Indies, became
          superior of the missions of Mongolia, and made two journeys into
          Tibet, being one of the first Europeans to penetrate that land.
          He published an account of his first journey (1624) under the
          title Novo descubrimento do Graô Catayo o dos Reynos de Tibet
          (Lisbon, 1626). His letter from Tibet for 1626 was published in
          Italian (Rome, 1626) and French (Paris, 1629).

          joined the Jesuits, taught theology at Coimbra, and was one of
          the Portuguese delegates to the Council of Trent. He replied to
          Martin Chemnitz's attack on the Jesuits (Theologtiæ Jesuitarum
          præcipua capita, Leipsic, 1562), in his Explicationum
          orthodoxarum de controversis religionis capitibus libri decem
          (Venice and Cologne, 1564; the first book, De origins Societatis
          Jesu, was published separately at Louvain, 1566, and, in French
          at Lyons, 1565). Chemnitz then wrote his celebrated Examen
          concilii Tridentini quadripartitum (Frankfort, 1565-73). Andrada
          was prevented by death from finishing his reply, but what he had
          prepared was published under the title, Defensio Tridentinæ
          fidei catholicæ quinque libri (Lisbon, 1578). See [329]Chemnitz.
          He was a brother of the Augustinian monk known as [330]Thomas a
          Jesu.

   Andrea, Jakob
          ANDREÄ, an´drê-?, JAKOB: Lutheran; b. at Waiblingen (7 m. n.e.
          of Stuttgart), Württemberg, Mar. 25, 1528; d. at Tübingen Jan.
          7, 1590. He was educated at the Pædagogium at Stuttgart, and
          studied theology at Tübingen from 1541 to 1546. In the latter
          year he became deacon at Stuttgart, but had to leave in 1548,
          after the introduction of the [331]Interim, and went to
          Tübingen, where he was appointed deacon at the Stiftskirche. In
          1553 he took the degree of doctor of theology, was appointed
          city pastor and afterward superintendent-general at Göppingen.
          He now developed activity in behalf of the Evangelical Church at
          large, helping to introduce the Reformation in many places. In
          1557 he attended the diets of Frankfort and Regensburg, and was
          present at the Conference of Worms. In 1559 he attended the Diet
          of Augsburg; in 1560 he held a church-visitation in Lauingen; in
          1561 he was at Erfurt; and in the fall of the same year, in
          company with the Tübingen chancellor Jakob Beurlin and the
          Stuttgart court-preacher Balthasar Bidembach, he went to Paris
          to attend the religious colloquy in Poissy.

          Beurlin having died at Paris, Andreä was appointed professor of
          theology, provost, and chancellor in Tübingen. In 1563 he went
          to Strasburg to settle a dispute caused by Zanchi on the
          inamissibilitas gratiæ, in 1564 he attended the conference in
          Bebenhausen to examine the Heidelberg Catechism, and the
          colloquy in Maulbronn. In 1568 his prince sent him to
          Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel to assist in the introduction of the
          Reformation and in framing an Evangelical Church ordinance; at
          the same time also he joined with Chemnitz, Selnekker, and other
          theologians of northern Germany, in paving the way for a
          consensus of the Saxon and other Evangelical Churches. Therewith
          began the most important period in Andreä's life, his activity
          in behalf of the Formula of Concord.

          Andreä's first plan was to neutralize the differences by means
          of formulas so general that they could be accepted by all. Two
          years were spent in traveling, during which he visited every
          Evangelical Church, university, and city in northern and
          southern Germany, and conferred with all important theologians.
          But neither the Flacians nor the Philippists, the two extreme
          parties among the Lutherans, had full confidence in him; and in
          the convention at Zerbst, May, 1570, his attempt proved a
          failure. Andreä now changed his plan. There was to be no more
          attempt at compromise, but the line was to be sharply drawn
          between Lutherans and the adherents of Zwingli and Calvin; and
          thus the Philippists and all other individual shades of
          Lutheranism were to be destroyed. Andreä preached six sermons on
          the points in controversy in 1572 and published them in the two
          following years. Copies were sent to Duke Julius, Chemnitz,
          Chyträus, and others. He then sent an epitome of these sermons,
          with the approval of the Tübingen faculty and the Stuttgart
          consistory, to the theologians of north Germany, for examination
          and criticism, who introduced some changes and produced the
          so-called Swabian-Saxon Concordia. A comparison of this
          Swabian-Saxon Concordia with Andreä's original Swabian Concordia
          and the Maulbronn Formula by a convention at Torgau, May 28,
          1576, resulted in the Liber Torgensis, which was again revised
          by Andreä, Chemnitz, and Selnekker at the monastery of Bergen in
          March, 1577. Three further conferences were held at Bergen, May
          19-28, 1580, at which Chyträus, Musculus, and Körner were
          present besides Andreä, Chemnitz, and Selnekker. The outcome was
          the Bergische Buch or Formula Concordiæ, which appeared June 25,
          1580, and which became the symbolical book of the Lutheran
          Church (see [332]Formula of Concord). Andreä received much
          abuse--even Selnekker, Chyträus, and Chemnitz were
          dissatisfied--but he bore it patiently, convinced that he had
          worked for the truth and the peace of the Church. He continued
          his reformatory work, visited churches, and took part in
          controversies; at the request of Duke Frederick of Württemberg
          he spoke against Beza at the colloquy of Mümpelgart in March,
          1586, discussing the Lord's Supper, the person of Christ,
          predestination, baptism, etc.

          There is no collected edition of Andreä's writings, which
          numbered more than one hundred and fifty. Among the more
          noteworthy were: Refutatio criminationum Hosii (Tübingen, 1560);
          De duabus naturis in Christo (1565); Bericht von der Ubiquität
          (1589); De instauratione studii theologici, De studio sacrarum
          literarum, published posthumously (1591 sqq.). His sermons have
          been often published (cf. Zwanzig Predigten von den Jahren 1557,
          1569, 1560, ed. Schmoller, Gütersloh, 1890).

   Andrea, Johann Valentin
          ANDREÄ, JOHANN VALENTIN: Theologian and satirist, grandson of
          Jakob Andreä; b. at Herrenberg, near Tübingen, Württemberg, Aug.
          17, 1586; d. at Stuttgart June 27, 1654. In 1601 he entered the
          University of Tübingen, where his reading covered a vast range
          on the mathematical sciences, language, philosophy, theology,
          music, and art. After living for a number of years as tutor in
          noble families and traveling extensively in France, Switzerland,
          Austria, and Italy, he became deacon at Vaihingen, Württemberg,
          in 1614. His duties gave him leisure for prolific authorship,
          and forty of his writings (numbering about 100 in all) were
          produced during his six years' sojourn in Vaihingen. In 1612 he
          published De christiani cosmoxeni genitura, a eulogy of early
          Christianity, and Die Christenburg, an epic allegory dealing
          with the struggles and ultimate triumph of the Christian soul.
          These were followed by Turbo (1616), a comedy in which pedantry
          was wittily satirized, and Menippus (1618), of which worldly
          folly was the subject. In 1619 he published Reipublicæ
          christianopolitanæ descriptio, an account of an ideal Christian
          state after the manner of More's Utopia and Campanella's City of
          the Sun. In all of these Andreä appears as a foe of sectarianism
          and intolerance, and with wit and energy pleads for a union of
          denominations on the basis of the fundamental Christian
          teachings. In 1614 there appeared anonymously Fama fraternitatis
          Roseæ Crucis, followed the next year by Confessio fraternitatis
          Roseæ Crucis, satires on the astrological and mystic agitations
          of the time. Andreä, whose authorship of the two pamphlets is
          more than probable, though not established beyond doubt, later
          declared that the [333]Order of the Rosicrucians was a myth and
          a product of his own brain; nevertheless he has been spoken of
          as the founder or restorer of that fraternity.

          From 1620 to 1639 Andreä was superintendent at Calw, displaying
          in the unhappy days of the Thirty Years' war heroic devotion to
          duty. In 1634 Calw was sacked, and of its 4,000 inhabitants only
          1,500 escaped the sword, while the plague carried off nearly
          one-half of the remainder. Andreä worked unceasingly among the
          dying, uniting in himself the duties of physician, minister, and
          grave-digger, and when the progress of the infection had been
          checked he set to work resolutely to restore law and order in
          the devastated city. In 1639 he was called to Stuttgart as court
          preacher with a seat in the Consistorium. Upon him fell the task
          of reorganizing the church system and the schools which had
          shared in the ruin that the war had brought. An admirer of the
          Genevan system of government, he attempted to introduce its
          principal features into the country, but failed because of the
          opposition of his fellow members in the Consistorium. He was
          partially successful, however, in establishing general and local
          conventions composed of government officials and members of the
          clergy for the enforcement of the church laws. The public
          regulation of private morals was a cardinal principle with him
          through life, and found expression in his Theophilus, written in
          1622 and published in 1649. This work contains also a
          dissertation on the education of the young that entitles Andreä
          to serious consideration as a predecessor of Pestalozzi. In 1650
          Andreä became general superintendent in Württemberg, but was
          compelled by failing health to resign his office.

   Andrea, Lorenz
          ANDREÄ, LORENZ (LARS ANDERSON): The great
          ecclesiastico-political Swedish reformer; b. probably at
          Strengnäs (40 m. e. of Stockholm) about 1480; d. there Apr. 29,
          1552. He was archdeacon of Strengnäs when through [334]Olaus
          Petri he was converted to the Lutheran views. In 1523 the newly
          chosen king Gustavus Vasa chose him to be his chancellor. As
          such he aided Olaus and Laurentius Petri in their reformatory
          activity and contributed largely to bring about the religious
          liberty granted at the Diet of Vesterås in 1527, and the full
          introduction of the Reformation at the Council of Oerebo in
          1529. In 1540 he and Olaus Petri opposed the effort of Vasa to
          transform the Swedish Church in the direction of presbyterianism
          and thus roused the king's anger. On trumped up charges of high
          treason Andreä was sentenced to death. The king pardoned him but
          deprived him of his offices and he lived the rest of his life in
          retirement. He wrote Tro och Gerningar ("Faith and Good-Works"),
          reprinted Stockholm, 1857. See [335]Sweden.

   Andrew the Apostle
          ANDREW THE APOSTLE: One of the twelve apostles, brother of
          Peter; born, like him, in Bethsaida (John i. 40, 44), and a
          member of Peter's family in Capernaum (Mark i. 29). According to
          John i. 35-42, Andrew was one of the first to follow Jesus in
          consequence of the testimony of the Baptist, and he brought
          Peter to the Lord. In Jesus's later choice of disciples in
          Galilee Peter and Andrew were the first whom he called to follow
          him permanently and intimately (Matt. iv. 18-20; Mark i. 16-18).
          It is not therefore without good reason that the Greeks give to
          Andrew the epithet "the first called." According to the Acta
          Andreæ (Tischendorf, Acta apostolarum apocrypha, Leipsic, 1851,
          pp. xl. sqq., 105 sqq.; R. A. Lipsius, Die apokryphen
          Apostelgeschichten, i., Brunswick, 1883, 543 sqq.), he labored
          in Greece; according to Eusebius (Hist. eccl., iii. 1), in
          Scythia, whence the Russians worship him as their apostle. His
          day is Nov. 30, because, according to tradition, he was
          crucified on that day at Patræ in Achaia by the proconsul Ægeas
          upon a crux decussata (X, hence known as St. Andrew's cross; cf.
          Fabricius, Codex apocryphus, Hamburg, 1703, pp. 456 sqq.). The
          name Andrew, although Greek, was common among Jews (Dio Cassius,
          lxviii. 32).

   Andrew of Cæsarea
          ANDREW OF CÆSAREA: Metropolitan of Cæsarea in Cappadocia, author
          of a commentary on the Apocalypse which has some importance in
          exegetical history. He has been variously thought to have
          flourished between the fifth and the ninth centuries. His time
          was certainly after the Persian persecutions and the strife
          between Arians and the orthodox "New Rome." A reference of the
          prophecy of Gog and Magog to the Scythian peoples of the extreme
          north, "whom we call Huns," has been thought to indicate the
          period before the rule of the Huns was broken; but the parallel
          in Arethas (MPG, cvi. 756) shows that "Huns" was used as a
          generic name for barbarian invaders. The only sure criterion by
          which the earliest possible date may be determined is Andrew's
          citation of authorities. The latest of these is the so-called
          Dionysius the Areopagite, whose writings are first certainly
          mentioned in 533; so that Andrew can not have written before the
          middle of the sixth century. He cites as witnesses to the
          inspiration of the Apocalypse, Papias, Irenæus, Methodius,
          Hippolytus, Gregory Nazianzen, and Cyril of Alexandria. His
          striking omission of Origen is explicable, in the light of his
          dependence on the latter's bitter opponent Methodius, by the
          recrudescence of Origenistic controversy in the sixth century.
          Other authorities are Epiphanius, Basil, Eusebius, and Justin;
          of non-Christian writers, he once cites Josephus.

          Andrew's expository method is set forth in the introductory
          dedication to his brother and fellow worker Macarius The
          Apocalypse, he says, like any other inspired Scripture, is at
          once historical, tropological, and anagogical; but the last
          aspect is most prominent in it, and requires unfolding. The
          expositor must, however, observe his limits. God has made his
          revelation in Christ susceptible by the human intellect; and so
          history and mystery are not to be treated alike. But the
          explanation may at least console and edify the reader by showing
          the transitoriness of all earthly things and by teaching him to
          long for the glories of the future. Andrew's exposition is
          accordingly characterized by the effort to arrive at a Christian
          interpretation of history, by an interest in its facts, and by a
          cautious restraint in the elucidation of prophecy. But in spite
          of this, his conception that the Apocalypse as a whole offers a
          clear revelation of the divine government of the world colors
          his exposition throughout. His style is usually glossarial,
          though here and there he adds an edifying excursus. Where
          necessary, he gives different views, leaving the reader to take
          his choice; but his commentary is much more than a mere catena,
          the quotations occupying a relatively small space. From the
          standpoint of textual criticism, as was first recognized by
          Bengel, the commentary has an importance of its own. Matthæi
          noticed that the glosses of Andrew had not seldom crept into the
          manuscripts; and F. Delitzsch was inclined to attribute the
          uncertainty of the cursive texts of the Apocalypse to the
          influence of the commentaries of Andrew and [336]Arethas. The
          commentary is in MPG, cvi.

   Andrew of Carniola
          ANDREW OF CARNIOLA: Archbishop of Carniola (Krain) in the
          fifteenth century. He was a Slavonian, and became a Dominican
          monk. Through the favor of the Emperor Frederick III. he was
          made archbishop of Carniola with residence at Laibach. He
          assumed the title "Cardinal of San Sisto." In 1482 he went to
          Switzerland and tried to get a general council convened at
          Basel. On July 21 he nailed a formal arraignment of Pope Sixtus
          IV. to the doors of the cathedral, accompanying it with a demand
          for a council. The pope excommunicated him, and the local
          authorities put him in prison, where he was found dead on Nov.
          13, 1484, probably having committed suicide. His secretary,
          Peter Numagen of Treves, thought him crazy.

   Andrew of Crete
          ANDREW OF CRETE: Archbishop of Crete; b. at Damascus; d. not
          earlier than 726. He became a monk at Jerusalem (whence he is
          sometimes called Andrew of Jerusalem), and was sent by the
          Patriarch Theodore to the sixth general council (Constantinople,
          680). Later he was made archbishop. He was inclined to
          Monothelitism, but was able to restore his reputation for
          orthodoxy by zeal for image-worship. He is commemorated as a
          saint in the Greek Church on July 7. Among Greek hymn-writers he
          occupies a prominent place as the inventor of the so-called
          canons (see [337]Canon). His penitential canon ("the great
          canon") of 250 strophes is especially famous. It is still sung
          on the Thursday before Palm Sunday and on some other days of
          Lent. Andrew was also the author of many homilies, some of them
          very long.

   Andrew of Lund
          ANDREW OF LUND (ANDERS SUNESÖN): Archbishop of Lund; b. at
          Knarthorp (3 m. n.w. of Copenhagen) about 1160; d. on the island
          of Ivö (in Lake Ivö, near Lund) June 24, 1228. He came of the
          noble family of Hvide whose members filled the highest offices
          in Church and State. In 1182 he went to Paris, completed his
          studies there, and, returning in 1190, was made dean of the
          cathedral of Roeskilde, where his elder brother was bishop.
          Canute VI. made him at the same time court-chancellor. In
          1194-96 he was on mission to Rome and Paris in regard to the
          repudiation, by Philip Augustus of France, of his wife Ingeborg,
          a sister of the Danish king. In 1201 Andrew succeeded Absalon as
          archbishop of Lund, an office which carried with it the
          dignities of primate and papal legate.

          Andrew was zealous in the suppression of concubinage among the
          priesthood, active in raising the standard of learning among
          them, and an enemy to the sale of indulgences. In 1206 he
          preached a crusade against the heathen inhabitants of the island
          of Oesel off the coast of Esthonia. When [338]Albert of Riga was
          compelled to seek the aid of the Danes against the Russians and
          Esthonians in 1218, he agreed to place the bishopric of Esthonia
          under the authority of the archbishop of Lund, and in the
          following year Andrew was engaged in regulating the affairs of
          that see. In 1223 he resigned his office and retired to the
          island of Ivö in the lake of the same name, achieving a
          reputation for wonder-working sanctity. He was the author of Lex
          Scandiæ provincialis (ed. P. G. Thorsen, Copenhagen, 1853) and
          Hexaëmeron (ed. M. C. Gertz, ib. 1892), a dogmatic poem in
          twelve books, expository of the theology of Peter Lombard.

   Andrew and Philip, Brotherhood of
          ANDREW AND PHILIP, BROTHERHOOD OF: An interdenominational
          religious society for men of all ages. The sole object, as
          declared by the constitution, is to spread Christ's kingdom
          among men. The brotherhood was founded by the Rev. Rufus Wilder
          Miller, of the Reformed Church, who organized the first local
          chapter at Reading, Pa., May 4, 1888. Other chapters were formed
          in the same denomination, conventions began to be held, and the
          Brotherhood Star, the monthly bulletin of the association was
          established. At the convention of Reformed chapters at
          Bethlehem, Pa., in 1890, the formation of brotherhood chapters
          in other denominations was recommended, the chapters in each
          denomination to be under the control of that denomination, and
          all to be united in a federation of brotherhoods. In this way
          the work was extended, until today there are 921 chapters in the
          United States, Canada, Japan, Australia, India, and other lands,
          with about 40,000 members, representing some twenty-three
          denominations; there are also fifty-eight brotherhoods for boys.

          Each local chapter is subjected to the supervision and control
          of the pastor and governing body of the congregation, and
          chapters of each denomination are associated in a denominational
          executive council. From these councils representatives are
          elected to a body known as the federal council of the
          brotherhood of Andrew and Philip. It is through this larger body
          that the literature of the association is issued. Denominational
          Councils are now organized in the Baptist, Congregational,
          Methodist Episcopal, Presbyterian, and Reformed Churches.

          The distinctive characteristic of the brotherhood is the
          emphasis it places upon personal work. There are two rules of
          prayer and service. The rule of service is to make personal
          efforts to bring men and boys within the hearing of the Gospel,
          as set forth in the service of the church, men's Bible-classes,
          and prayer-meetings. The rule of prayer is to pray daily for the
          spread of Christ's kingdom among men, and God's blessing upon
          the labors of the brotherhood. Chapters sustain a weekly
          Bible-class, or men's prayer-meeting, and engage in a great
          variety of good works, as ushering, work in Sunday-schools,
          visiting jails, hospitals, etc.--all as the needs of the church
          may require. Chapters also maintain free reading-rooms and
          gymnasiums, organize boys' clubs and cottage prayer-meetings,
          provide for the evening church service, assist in the orchestra
          or choir, support home and foreign missions, and do other work
          of a similar character.

          London) 1555; d. at Winchester House, Southwark, Sept. 26, 1626.
          He entered Pembroke Hall, Cambridge, in 1571, was graduated B.A.
          1575, was ordained 1580, and became catechist at Pembroke; he
          was master of Pembroke from 1589 to 1605. He also held the
          living of St. Giles's, Cripplegate, and was prebendary of St.
          Paul's; he became chaplain to the queen and dean of Westminster
          in the latter part of Elizabeth's reign. Under James I. he was
          made bishop of Chichester in 1605, of Ely in 1609, and of
          Winchester in 1619. He was a man of austere piety, rigorous in
          the performance of private devotion, liberal in charities, one
          of the most learned men of his time, and enjoys a well-deserved
          reputation as prelate, as preacher, and as writer. He was
          thought by many to be the natural successor to Bancroft as
          archbishop of Canterbury in 1611; but [339]George Abbot was
          appointed instead. Andrewes was a member of the [340]Hampton
          Court Conference, and his name heads the list of scholars
          appointed in 1607 to prepare the Authorized Version; he belonged
          to the first company of translators, to whom were assigned the
          books of the Old Testament as far as II Kings.

          The only writings of Bishop Andrewes published during his life
          were the Tortura Torti sive ad Matthæi Torti responsio (1609)
          and one or two subsequent treatises, all written in reply to
          Cardinal Bellarmine, who had attacked King James because of the
          oath of allegiance imposed upon Roman Catholics in England after
          the Gunpowder Plot. In 1629 ninety-six of his sermons were
          published, edited by Bishops Buckeridge and Laud; certain
          sermons have been many times reedited and reprinted. A number of
          volumes based upon his works (such as The Pattern of
          Catechistical Doctrine, or an Exposition of the Ten
          Commandments, 1642) pass under his name. His prayers, composed
          in Greek and Latin for his own use, are famous, and have been
          often translated (cf. The Greek Devotions of Lancelot Andrewes,
          from the manuscript given by him to William Laud and recently
          discovered, ed. P. G. Medd, London, 1892; The Devotions of
          Bishop Andrewes, Græce et Latine, ed. H. Veale, 1895; The
          Private Devotions of Lancelot Andrewes, ed. E. Venables, 1883).

          Bibliography: His works, with his life by H. Isaacson (first
          published 1650) and other notices, are collected in the Library
          of Anglo-Catholic Theology, 11 vols., Oxford, 1841-54. There are

   Andrews, Edward Gayer
          ANDREWS, EDWARD GAYER: Methodist Episcopal bishop; b. at New
          Hartford, N. Y., Aug. 7, 1825. He was educated at Cazenovia
          Seminary, Cazenovia, N. Y., and Wesleyan University, Middletown,
          Conn. (B.A., 1847). He held various pastorates in Methodist
          Episcopal churches in Central New York from 1848 to 1854, when
          he was appointed teacher and principal in Cazenovia Seminary,
          where he remained until 1864. He was then pastor in Stamford,
          Conn., from 1864 to 1867 and in Brooklyn, N. Y., from 1867 to
          1872. In the latter year he was elected bishop. He visited
          Methodist Episcopal missions in Europe and India in 1876-77, in
          Mexico in 1881, and in Japan, Korea, and China in 1889-90, while
          in 1894 he was a delegate to the British and Irish Methodist
          Conference. In theology he holds the faith of his denomination
          for essentials of doctrine, but with deference to the results of
          recent Biblical investigations.

   Andrews, Elisha Benjamin
          ANDREWS, ELISHA BENJAMIN: Baptist; b. at Hinsdale, N. H., Jan.
          10, 1844. He was educated at Brown University (B.A., 1870),
          Newton Theological Institution (1874), and the Massachusetts
          Institute of Technology (1879-80), and also studied in the
          universities of Berlin and Munich (1882-83). He served in the
          Union army in the Civil War, being promoted from private to
          second lieutenant. He was principal of the Connecticut Literary
          Institute, Suffield, Conn., 1870-72, and pastor of the First
          Baptist Church, Beverly, Mass., 1874-75. In the latter year he
          was appointed president of Denison University, Granville, Ill.,
          and held this position until 1879, when he accepted a call to
          Newton Theological Institution as professor of homiletics and
          practical theology. In 1882 he became professor of history and
          political economy at Brown University, and in 1888 of political
          economy and finance at Cornell. In 1889 he was chosen president
          of Brown University, where he remained until 1898. He then
          became superintendent of the Chicago schools until 1900, when he
          was made chancellor of the University of Nebraska, at Lincoln, a
          position which he still occupies. He was a member of the United
          States delegation to the Brussels International Monetary
          Commission in 1892, and is also a member of the Grand Army of
          the Republic, the Loyal Legion, and the American Economic
          Association. In theology he is a liberal evangelical Baptist.
          His works include Brief Institutes of Constitutional History,
          English and American (New York, 1886); Brief institutes of
          General History (1887); Institutes of Economics (1889); The
          Problem of Cosmology (1891); Eternal Words (1893; a volume of
          sermons); Wealth and Moral Law (1894); An Honest Dollar, with
          seven other Essays on Bimetallism (1894); History of the United
          States (2 vols., 1894; revised and enlarged, 5 vols., 1905); and
          History of the United States in the last Quarter Century (1896).
          He has also published Outlines of the Principles of History (New
          York, 1893), a translation of J. G. Droysen's Grundris der
          Historik (3d ed., Leipsic, 1882).

   Andrews, Samuel James
          ANDREWS, SAMUEL JAMES: Catholic Apostolic Church; b. at Danbury,
          Conn., July 30, 1817; d. at Hartford Oct. 11, 1906. He was
          educated at Williams College (B.A., 1839), and studied law in
          Hartford, Boston, and New York, being admitted to the
          Connecticut bar in 1842 and to the Ohio bar in 1844. In the
          following year, however, he gave up law and studied theology at
          Lane Theological Seminary, Cincinnati. He was licensed as a
          Congregational clergyman in Connecticut in 1846, and two years
          later was ordained pastor of the Congregational church at East
          Windsor, Conn. Loss of voice compelled him to retire from the
          ministry in 1855, although he still preached occasionally. In
          1865 he was appointed an instructor in Trinity College,
          Hartford, and three years later took charge of a Catholic
          Apostolic (Irvingite) church in the same city. In theology he
          was a consistent follower of the creed which he professed. His
          chief writings were: Life of Our Lord Upon the Earth (New York,
          1862); God's Revelations of Himself to Man (1885); Christianity
          and Anti-Christianity in Their Final Conflict (1898); The Church
          and its Organic Ministries (1899); William Watson Andrews, a
          Religious Biography (1900; life, letters, and writings of his
          brother, [341]William Watson Andrews); and Man and the
          Incarnation (1905).

   Andrews, William Watson
          ANDREWS, WILLIAM WATSON: Catholic Apostolic Church, brother of
          Samuel James Andrews; b. at Windham, Conn., July 26, 1810; d. at
          Wethersfield, Conn., Oct. 17, 1897. He was graduated at Yale in
          1831. During this year his attention was drawn to the religious
          movement then going on in England which culminated in the
          Catholic Apostolic Church. The point that seems at first to have
          interested him most was whether the gifts of the Spirit as
          originally given were or were not to abide in the Church, and
          his study of the Scriptures led him to the conclusion that they
          are a permanent endowment, and, if not still possessed, it was
          because of unbelief. Closely connected with the work of the
          Spirit in the Church was another question: Was the return of the
          Lord to be desired, and the Church to be ever praying and
          looking for it? Believing this return to be an object of hope,
          he was led to ask if any preparation was needed; and, if so,
          might not the work in England be the preparation? In 1833 he was
          licensed to preach, and in May, 1834, was ordained pastor of a
          Congregational church in Kent, Conn. Here he continued fifteen
          years, declining invitations to go to larger spheres of labor,
          preferring his quiet country life, which gave him time for study
          and reflection. In 1842, partly for his health, and partly to
          learn from personal observation the progress of the religious
          movement which interested him, he went to England and became
          fully convinced that the movement was of God. He offered himself
          to its leaders as ready to take part in it, but was directed by
          them to return to his parish and continue his work there. This
          he did, but on the death of his wife in 1848, he was released
          from his charge by the North Association of Litchfield County,
          and soon entered the Apostolic communion. In 1849 he was
          appointed pastor of a small congregation at Potsdam, N. Y., and
          remained there for six years, doing some work elsewhere as an
          evangelist. In 1856 he left Potsdam and entered upon his
          evangelistic work in which he continued till his death. From
          1858 his home was in Wethersfield, Conn.

          The only book published by Mr. Andrews was The Miscellanies and
          Correspondence of Hon. John Cotton Smith (New York, 1847). Of
          his numerous addresses, articles, and pamphlets mention may be
          made of his sermon at Kent, May 1849, on withdrawing from the
          Congregational ministry; The True Constitution of the Church,
          read before the North Association of Litchfield County, 1855;
          Review of Mrs. Oliphant's Life of Edward Irving, in The New
          Englander, 1863 (reprinted in Scotland, 1864 and 1900); Remarks

          request of the Hartford Fourth Association, 1866; The Catholic
          Apostolic Church, in the Bibliotheca Sacra, 1866; The Catholic
          Apostolic Church, in Schaff's Creeds of Christendom, i., New
          York, 1884, 905-915; and an address at Kent, his old parish, on
          the sixtieth anniversary of his ordination, May 27, 1894.

          Conclusion (§ 5).

          The name "Angel" as a designation for spiritual beings of the
          supernatural world, has come into modern languages with
          Christianity from the Greek angelos ("messenger"), which is
          itself a rendering of the Hebrew mal'akh. The latter, in form an
          abstract noun ("mission," "message"), occurs only as a concrete
          ("messenger"), and acquired a special meaning, particularly in
          the singular, as the designation of a supernatural bearer of a
          divine revelation. The transition was then easy to the sense of
          a generic name for the beings of the heavenly world, from whom
          the God of Israel is called "Yahweh, God of Hosts," or "Yahweh
          of Hosts." To distinguish angels from men, they are called "sons
          of God" (Gen. vi. 2, 4; Job i. 6, ii. 1, xxxviii. 7) or "sons of
          the mighty" (Ps. xxix. 1, margin, lxxxix. 6). A special
          connection with God is always implied, as well as a certain
          superiority over men (I Sam. xxix. 9; II Sam. xiv. 17, 20). This
          connection is emphasized by the epithet "holy" (A. V., "saints";
          Job v. 1, xv. 15; Ps. lxxxix. 5, 7; Dan. viii. 13; Zech. xiv.
          5). In I Kings xxii. 19-24 and Acts xxiii. 9 a distinction is
          made between angels and spirits, and in the Talmud the latter
          name is used for demons only. With reference to their duties
          angels are called "watchers" in Dan. iv. 13, 17, 23.

I. Biblical Conceptions:

  1. Angels are God's Servants.

          As concerns their function, it is not the Biblical conception
          that angels are the indispensable means of communication between
          the higher and lower worlds, nor are they a personification of
          nature powers. Yet they are consistently represented as serving
          God's purposes in revelation and salvation, and are his
          "ministering spirits" (Heb. i. 14) from the appointment of the
          cherubim to guard Eden (Gen. iii. 24) to their activity at the
          second coming and the end of the world (Matt. xiii. 41, xxiv.
          29-31; cf. Gen. xxiv. 7, 40, xlviii. 16; Ex. xiv. 19, xxiii. 20,
          23; Luke xvi. 22). Sometimes they appear in companies (Gen.
          xxviii. 12, xxxii. 1-2; II Kings vi. 16-17; Matt. xxv. 31; Luke
          ii. 13; Rev. xix. 14), but usually it is one angel who executes
          God's command; he is called the "angel of God" or "angel of
          Yahweh" (Gen. xvi. 7, 9-11, xxi. 17; Ex. iii. 2, xiv. 19; Judges
          vi. 20; and often). The relation of the "angel of Yahweh" to
          Yahweh himself is a difficult question. One of the three who
          appear in Gen. xviii. 2, 22 (cf. xix. 1) is evidently Yahweh,
          and Yahweh and his angel are both called the guide of Israel
          (Ex. xiii. 21, xiv. 19). Similar identification apparently
          occurs elsewhere, while in Zech. i. 9, 12-14, and other passages
          there is a sharp distinction.

  2. The New Testament Conception not Different from the Old.

          In the New Testament the angel of the Lord occurs only when an
          angel has been previously mentioned (Matt. i. 24; Luke i. 11,
          13, ii. 9, 10, 13; Acts xii. 7, 11, vii. 30, 38, Gk. text).
          There is no thought of an identification of the angel with the
          Lord. That the conception is different from that of the Old
          Testament can not be proved, and such an assumption is not in
          accord with Stephen's references (Acts vii. 30-35) to the
          appearance in the burning bush (Ex. iii.). But the distinction
          between the angel and Yahweh does not hinder from making the
          angel speak as Yahweh or from speaking of the angel as of
          Yahweh. It follows that the distinction can not be a product of
          later times. The angel is not the Logos, the second person of
          the Trinity, as assumed by the Greek Fathers, the older Lutheran
          dogmaticians, and Hengstenberg; nor is he merely a theophany
          (Vatke, De Wette, Wellhausen, Kosters, and others). The former
          view is not consistent with the New Testament revelation, which
          makes it impossible to find in the Old Testament a knowledge of
          the threefold character of God; and the latter falls because a
          "mission," not an "appearance," of God is always spoken of. The
          true Biblical conception of the "angel of Yahweh" is that of a
          created being (Neh. ix. 6), belonging to the heavenly hosts
          (Augustine, Jerome, Hofmann, Riehm), who represents God, but is
          in no way identified with God. The fact, that in the New
          Testament the angel of Yahweh recedes, does not justify the
          assumption that he is a type of Christ. A realization of God's
          presence through angels and the communication of his revelation
          by them was as necessary in the old covenant as the revelation
          and presence of God in Christ or in the Holy Spirit are in the
          new (cf. Acts vii. 38; Gal. iii. 19; Heb. ii. 2). The angel has
          no more place in the new covenant because the first has been
          made old and is "ready to vanish away" (Heb. viii. 13).

  3. Later Developments.

          From the beginning the appearance of an angel is looked upon as
          a sign of God's favor (Gen. xxiv. 7, 40, xlviii. 16; Ex. xxiii.
          20; II Kings xix. 35; Isa. lxiii. 9), and the belief that God's
          angels guard his servants finds expression in the Psalms (Ps.
          xxxiv. 7, xci. 11). From the unity of God arises the conception
          of a multiplicity of angels (Gen. xxviii. 12, xxxii. 2); and
          then it is only a step to that of Yahweh's hosts (Josh. v.
          14-15), with which he comes to the help of Israel (Isa. xxxi.
          4-5), which surround his throne, offering him praise and
          adoration (I Kings xxii. 19; Ps. cxlviii. 2), and constitute, in
          the language of the synagogue, "the family above." Apocalyptic
          literature develops the thought, depicting in symbolic
          narratives the part of the angels in the history of Israel (cf.
          the visions of Zechariah, Ezekiel, and Daniel). In the Book of
          Daniel (viii. 16, ix. 21, x. 13, xii. 1) two angels are
          named--Gabriel and Michael. The fact that names are given (cf.
          Judges xiii. 18) and the names themselves indicate Babylonian
          influence, which later tradition recognizes by ascribing the
          many angels' names which it knows to Babylon (Genesis, Rabbah
          xlviii.). What is said of these two angels does not contradict
          existing views, but is merely a development of them, influenced
          by contact with Babylonian and Persian ideas. The fantastic and
          bizarre conceptions of later Judaism, however, can not deny
          their origin from this heathenism (cf. Tobit iii. 17, v. 6, 21,
          vi. 4-17, viii. 2-3). That which is really new in the Book of
          Daniel concerns the participation of the angels in the sin of
          the world. In the New Testament the apocalyptic symbolism,
          appears in the Book of Revelation only (cf. xii. 7 sqq.; Jude
          9). All allusions to angels in New Testament history and in the
          Epistles can be explained as in full accord with Old Testament
          conceptions, and if new ideas are found by any it is only
          because of the desire to find them. It requires great art of
          eisegesis to ascribe to Paul (as does Everling) the angel
          doctrine of Jewish legend and rabbinic theology.

  4. Distinctions among Angels. Cherubim and Seraphim. Fallen Angels.

          There are evidently distinctions among angels, based on
          differences of duties, not of rank. In this way passages like
          Dan. x. 13, xii. 1; I Thess. iv. 16; Jude 9 are to be explained.
          The same observation holds with regard to the cherubim and
          seraphim, who belong to the angels. The signification of the
          latter name (only in Isa. vi.) is not certain. From comparison
          with the Arabic it has been thought to mean nobilis, whence the
          signification would be "angel-leader" (cf. Josh. v. 13-15; Dan.
          x. 13, xii. 1). Another derivation is from the Hebrew saraph,
          "to burn," and the name is then thought to be given to these
          beings because of their peculiar relation to the divine
          holiness, of which they are the heralds and guards. Whether the
          prophet coined the name with reference to the act attributed to
          the seraph in verses 6-7, or found it already in use, can not be
          determined. In any case it is the name only and not the
          representation that is new. The description of their form is
          different from that of the cherubim. In the latter case the
          description is symbolic, and the symbolism is more and more
          richly developed from the cherubim that guard Eden, in the
          figures of the Tabernacle (Ex. xxv. 17-22) and the Temple (I
          Kings vi. 23-28), and the visions of Ezekiel (Ezek. i. 4-14,
          iii. 12-14, ix. 3, x. 6-22, xi. 22, xli. 18), to the description
          of the Apocalypse (Rev. iv. 6-11). In that way they unite in
          themselves all excellencies, they typify the exaltation of God
          above every creature, as well as the purpose that every creature
          shall be a bearer of the majesty of God. Sin is found among the
          angels (Gen. vi. 1-4; II Pet. ii. 4; Jude 6), but not, as among
          men, as something affecting all. Since Satan appears among the
          "sons of God" (Job i. 6; cf. I Chron. xxi. 1; Zech. iii. 2), he
          is reckoned among the angels. The interest which he shows in the
          sin of men in these passages justifies the assumption (first in
          Wisdom, ii. 24; cf. Rev. xii. 9, xx. 2) that he is the serpent
          of Gen. iii. He is therefore the first fallen, to whom the other
          fallen angels (or demons) join themselves as his angels (Matt.
          xxv. 41). "Evil angels" (Ps. lxxviii. 49) are angels who do ill
          at God's command, not wicked angels.

          As concerns the origin of the Biblical conception of angels, the
          view that they represent the natural powers of old Semitic
          heathenism stands or falls with the representation of Deut. iv.
          19 (also in Paul) that heathenism is an apostasy from the true
          God. It may be noted that angels never serve as an explanation
          of the events of nature, but appear only in connection with a
          divine revelation. The decision depends also on the question as
          to the reality of angels. That they, as well as Satan and the
          demons, actually exist is held to be indubitably proved by the
          words and conduct of Jesus. The upper world, to which we are
          striving, is full of life and needs not to be peopled by us, but
          is prepared for us with all that is proper to it, freed from the
          limitations of the present.

          (H. Cremer.)

II. Judaic Notions:

  1. Names and Classes.

          To the two names known to Daniel the Book of Tobit (iii. 17)
          adds that of Raphael, while the Book of Enoch (xxi.) knows seven
          archangels--Uriel, Raphael, Raguel, Michael, Sariel, Gabriel,
          Jerahmeel--and seven classes of angels (lxi. 10), namely, the
          cherubim, seraphim, ophanim, all the angels of power,
          principalities, the Elect One (Messiah), and the (elementary)
          powers of the earth and water. They have seven angelic virtues
          (lxi. 11): the spirit of faith, of wisdom, of patience, of
          mercy, of judgment, of peace, and of goodness.

  2. Functions, Duties, etc.

          In the Slavonic Enoch and rabbinic literature, the further
          development of the heavenly hierarchy introduces the seven
          heavens, and tells of the food of angels, the hours at which
          they worship God, their language, and their knowledge. They
          mediate between God and man, carry prayers to the throne of God
          (Tobit xii. 12-15; Gk. Apoc. Baruch xi.), and accompany the dead
          on their departure from this world. Angels are also the
          guardians of the nations. In Enoch xxxix. 59 the seventy
          shepherds are the guardian angels of the seventy nations, over
          whom rules Michael, as Israel's angel-prince. With these God
          sits in council when holding judgment over the world, each angel
          pleading the cause of his nation. It was these angel-princes
          whom Jacob saw in his dream (Gen. Rabbah lxviii.). There is also
          a special angel-prince set over the world, Sar ha-olam (Talmud,
          Yebamot 16b; ?ullin 60a; Sanhedrin 94a), who is said to have
          composed Ps. xxxvii. 25, civ. 31, and, partly, Isa. xxiv. 16.
          Besides the guardian angels of the nations, sixty-three angels
          are mentioned as janitors of the seven heavens, and at each of
          these heavens stand other angels as seal-bearers. The head and
          chief of all these is Asriel. Angels protect the pious and help
          them in their transactions. Every man has a special guardian
          angel, and there are accompanying angels. Thus two angels--one
          good and one evil--accompany man as he leaves the synagogue on
          Sabbath eve. Three good angels receive the souls of the pious,
          and three evil angels those of the wicked, who testify for them
          (Talmud, Shabbat 119a; ketubot 104a). Great as is the number and
          influence of the angels, yet in many respects they are inferior
          to man. Enoch (xv. 2) intercedes on behalf of the angels,
          instead of having them intercede for him; and none of the angels
          could see what he saw of God's glory (xiv. 21), or learn the
          secrets of God as he knew them (Slavonic Enoch xxiv. 3; Ascensio
          Isaiæ ix. 27-38). Adam was to be worshiped by the angels as the
          image of God (Vita Adæ et Evæ, p. 14; Gen. Rabbah viii.); before
          his fall his place was within the precincts of God's own
          majesty, where the angels can not stay (Gen. Rabbah xxi.). They
          were inferior in intelligence to Adam, when names were given to
          all things (Pirke Rabbi Eliezer xiii.). Adam reclined in
          Paradise, and the ministering angels roasted meat and strained
          wine for him (Talmud, Sanhedrin 59b). Every man that does not
          practise magic enters a department of heaven to which even the
          ministering angels have no access (Talmud, Nedarim 32a).

          The essence of the angels is fire; they sustain themselves in
          fire; their fiery breath consumes men, and no man can endure the
          sound of their voices (Talmud, Shabbat 88b; Hagigah 14b).
          Another theory is that they are half fire and half water, and
          that God makes peace between the opposing elements (Jerusalem
          Talmud, Rosh ha-Shanah ii. 58a). According to one tradition,
          each angel was one-third of a world in size; according to
          another, 2,000 parasangs, his hand reaching from heaven to
          earth. The angels, numbering either 496,000 or 499,000, are said
          to have been created either on the first day (Book of Jubilees
          ii. 2), the second day (Slavonic Enoch), or on the fifth day
          (Gen. Rabbah iii.). Their food is manna, of which Adam and Eve
          ate before they sinned (Vita Adæ et Evæ, p. 4).

          As a rule, the angels are represented as good, and as not
          subject to evil impulses (Gen. Rabbah xlviii. 14); nevertheless,
          two were expelled from heaven for 138 years on account of
          prematurely disclosing the decree of Sodom's destruction (ib.).
          Two narratives are given in Enoch vi.-xv., of the fall of the
          angels. According to one, Azazel was the leader of the
          rebellion, and the chief debaucher of women; according to the
          other, Samiaza, or Shamhazai, was the chief seducer. Each has
          ten chieftains and 100 angels at his command. They are punished
          at the hands of Michael, Gabriel, Raphael, and Uriel (Enoch ix.
          1, xl. 2).

III. Development of the Scriptural Angelology:

          The nature of Holy Scripture forbids any attempt to build upon
          its text a systematic angelology. The Bible covers a wide field
          of time, and, for anything save its main purpose, it is a book
          of imperfect record. Moreover, its evidence on this question is
          less apt to be direct than indirect. An elaborate angelology can
          therefore be derived from the Bible only by doing violence to
          sound exegesis. Yet it is possible to detect a general movement
          of thought and to deduce a conclusion, touching the weight to be
          given to the scriptural doctrine of angels.

  1. The Belief in Angels Common to All Antiquity.

          The belief in angels is not an original element in the
          Scriptures; the Bible holds it in common with all the men of
          antiquity, who lacked a unifying conception of law and made the
          poet and the theologian one and the same person. So the mind
          instinctively peopled space with personal forces both good and
          evil. The field of reality, being governed neither by the
          scientific idea of law nor by the monotheistic idea of God, was
          inevitably broken up and parceled out by a kind of spiritual
          feudalism. The belief in angels being thus instinctive, it
          follows that, so far as the Scriptures are concerned, the
          doctrine in question is not a primary one; on the contrary, it
          is a subordinate element. To be true to the Bible itself, the
          emphasis must be put on the relation between that belief in
          angels which the men of the Bible inherited from antiquity and
          that saving knowledge of the divine unity which is the heart of
          God's word. The center of gravity and interest is not in
          angelology as such.

  2. The Hexateuch.

          The central and controlling element in the Old Testament is the
          self-revelation of God in his holy and creative unity. The pith
          of prophecy is God's manifestation of himself in terms of the
          moral order in the experience of the chosen nation. It is
          significant, then, that in the Hexateuch the angels in their
          plurality play a small part (Gen. xix. 15, xxxii. 1). The "angel
          of Yahweh," "the angel of the presence," on the other hand, are
          constantly in evidence. The unity of God, dominating the
          religious consciousness, has given a monarchical turn to the
          angelology of antiquity.

  3. The Prophets.

          In the preexilic prophets the angels appear but twice. In both
          cases (Hosea xii. 4, Isa. xxxvii. 36) the usage is unitary. This
          fact, taken with the extreme rarity of the term on the one hand,
          and, on the other hand, with the fact that the existence of
          heavenly hosts is taken for granted (Isa. vi. 1-6), gives a
          weighty piece of evidence. Even in exilic prophecy as a whole
          there is no emphasis. The "angel of the presence" appears once
          (Isa. lxiii. 9). The angels in their plurality do not appear.
          The prophetic passion spends itself upon God's presence in the
          crises of the nation's history, and upon his power to guide it
          toward a supreme moral end (the day of Yahweh). Even in Ezekiel,
          in whom the apocalyptic tendency begins to be strongly marked,
          the angels are not named.

          But in Zechariah a new turn is taken. The angel of Yahweh
          appears incessantly. Moreover, the angels in their plurality
          appear (Zech. ii. 3). The apocalyptic tendency is becoming
          dominant. The moral passion of prophetism is declining. And from
          Zechariah's time on, there seems to be a steady increase in the
          amount of attention given to the angels. How far this is due to
          the influence of Parseeism and how far to the inherent tendency
          of Judaism, it may be impossible to determine with precision.
          But certain it is that as Judaism abounds in its own sense and
          its difference from prophetism develops, the angels play a
          larger and yet larger part. The climax is reached when the
          Essenes impose upon those entering the order a terrible oath not
          to betray the names of the angels (Josephus, War, II. viii. 7).
          At this point, Judaism comes close to Chaldean magic.

  4. The New Testament.

          Davidson has said (DB, i., p. 97) that in the New Testament
          there is no advance. The statement is misleading. There is not
          nor can there be any advance beyond the Jewish angelology. The
          Jewish mystic knew a great deal about the angelic hosts, their
          hierarchical order, and their names. In truth, he knew more than
          there was to know. "Advance" in this direction would have meant
          a fuller exposition of unreality. But the New Testament is the
          literary product of a magnificent revival of Hebrew prophetism.
          The clarity of the moral and spiritual consciousness relegates
          the angels to a secondary position. Even in the New Testament
          Apocalypse the angels are wholly subsidiary to the Kingdom of
          God. Thus in xix. 10, xxi. 17, and xxii. 9 a view appears
          fundamentally opposed to that of mystical Judaism. Angels and
          men are citizens of one divine commonwealth. Worship of the
          angels is not to be thought of. So, again, in the synoptic
          gospels and the Acts, the existence of the angels, while taken
          for granted, is not a primary element of consciousness.

          In the Pauline and Petrine letters, the angels play an even more
          subordinate part. The Christians of Corinth, in danger of
          falling below their dignity, are informed that the disciples of
          Christ will be his coassessors in judging the angels (I Cor. vi.
          3). Peter, dwelling on the consummation of prophecy, declares
          that angels desire to understand the mystery of the gospel (I
          Pet. i. 12). In Heb. i. 14 their function is clearly described.
          They are spirits worshiping God and sent from God to serve the
          followers of Jesus.

  5. Conclusion.

          When, therefore, the Scriptures are placed against the
          background of antiquity, a certain unity of movement and thought
          is found. The doctrine of angels is inherited, not created. And
          it is controlled and utilized by the saving word, the
          self-revelation of God as the creative unity within human
          consciousness and society, the moralizing power in history, and
          the moral end toward which nature and history are being guided
          (Rom. xi. 36). From this point of view the ecclesiastical
          discussion over the worship of angels and the careful
          distinction between dulia and latria is more or less a reversion
          of type.

   Angelicals
          ANGELICALS: A sisterhood founded about 1530 by Ludovica di
          Torelli, Countess of Guastalla (then, at the age of twenty-five,
          for the second time a widow), to care for sick and reformed
          women. The members were to lead lives of angelic purity (whence
          the name) and self-denial, indicated by coarse clothing, a
          wooden cross on the breast, and a cord about the neck. The
          foundress placed them under the supervision of Antonia Maria
          Zaccaria, founder and director of the [344]Barnabites; and
          herself labored, under the monastic name of Paola Maria, as
          manager of the main convent of her society near Milan till her
          death (Oct. 29, 1569). The order was first confirmed by Paul
          III. (1534) with the rule of St. Augustine, with the provision
          that the Angelicals were to assist the Barnabites in their
          missionary work among women. The obligation to live in seclusion
          was adopted in 1557. Archbishop Borromeo of Milan subjected the
          statutes of the order to a stricter revision, which was
          confirmed by Urban VIII. (1625). The order never spread outside
          of Lombardy (especially Milan and Cremona) and was dissolved at
          the beginning of the nineteenth century. A branch, however,
          still exists, the Society of the Guastallinæ founded by the same
          Countess Torelli, devoted to the education of girls of noble
          birth (the number being limited to 18); they occupy a building
          outside the Porta Romana at Milan, and are under the supervision
          of the Barnabites.

   Angelis, Girolamo
          ANGELIS, an´je-lis, GIROLAMO, jî-rO´l-??mO: Jesuit missionary;
          b. at Castro Giovanni, Sicily, 1567; d. in Japan Dec. 24, 1623.
          He joined the Jesuits at the age of eighteen, and in 1602 went
          to Japan. When the Jesuits were expelled from the country in
          1614, he assumed Japanese dress and remained for nine years
          without discovery. He was then imprisoned and burned alive with
          two other Jesuits and forty-two native Christians. He wrote
          Relazione del regno di Iezo, printed with letters of other
          Jesuits at Rome in 1624, and separately the next year. He was
          canonized by Pius IX.

   Angelus
          ANGELUS, an´je-lus: The ordinary name (taken from its opening
          word in Latin) of a Roman Catholic prayer, recited three times a
          day, when the church bells ring at 6 a.m., at noon, and at 6
          p.m. It consists of three versicles and responses, each followed
          by a "Hail Mary!" and a collect, which is the same as that for
          the Annunciation in the Anglican Prayer Book, the whole forming
          a devotion in honor of the incarnation of Christ. In its present
          form it dates from the middle of the sixteenth century, though
          the custom of ringing bells at certain times of the day to
          remind the faithful of certain prayers is at least as old as the
          thirteenth.

          the confidence of Charlemagne till the end of the latter's life,
          and was employed in many difficult negotiations. That he entered
          the monastery of Centula (the modern St. Riquier, about 25 m.
          n.w. of Amiens) in 790 is not probable; he was abbot of the
          monastery later, however, and rebuilt it with much splendor. He
          was named the "Homer" of the literary circle at Charlemagne's
          court, and a few Latin lyrics and a fragment of an epic ascribed
          to him are extant (in MPL, xcix. 825-854; MGH, Script., xv. 1,
          1887, 173-181; Poetæ Latini ævi carolini, i., 1881, 355-381).

   Angilram
          ANGILRAM, an´´gil-r?m (Fr. pron. ??n´´zhîl-r??m´): Bishop of
          Metz 768, after 787 with the title of archbishop; d. 791. In 784
          he was made court chaplain by Charlemagne, who obtained from the
          pope a dispensation freeing Angilram from the obligation of
          residing at the seat of his bishopric. Most codices of the
          pseudo-Isidorian decretals contain a minor collection of
          statutes, consisting of seventy-one, seventy-two, or eighty
          chapters relating to suits against the clergy, especially
          bishops, and generally bearing the name Capitula Angilramni. In
          some manuscripts the superscription states that Angilram
          presented these capitula to Pope Adrian; in others (the older
          and better) that the pope presented them to Angilram when he was
          in Rome in connection with his affair. In either version the
          story is improbable, and it is generally agreed that Angilram
          had nothing to do with these capitula. They were probably
          written by the author of the [345]pseudo-Isidorian decretals.

   Anglican Church
          ANGLICAN CHURCH or COMMUNION: A comprehensive name for the
          Reformation churches of English origin, including the Church of
          England and its branches in Ireland, Scotland, the colonies, and
          India, with the various missionary jurisdictions, and the
          Protestant Episcopal Church of the United States. The liturgy in
          all is the Book of Common Prayer with modifications (see
          [346]Common Prayer, Book of), and the Thirty-nine Articles are
          accepted with changes necessary to fit local conditions (see
          [347]Thirty-Nine Articles). All have episcopal organization and
          hold to the "historic episcopate" (see [348]Apostolic
          Succession). The [349]Lambeth Conference is a meeting of bishops
          of the Anglican communion intended to promote the unity and
          fellowship of its members. See [350]England, Church of;
          [351]Ireland; [352]Scotland; [353]Protestant Episcopal Church.

   Anglo-Saxons, Conversion of the
          ANGLO-SAXONS, CONVERSION OF THE: The Angles, Saxons, and kindred
          peoples who by the end of the sixth century were established in
          the east of Britain from the Forth southward and in the greater
          part of the south, in their Continental homes were all
          worshipers of Woden, whom they considered their ancestor. They
          dispossessed in England a fully Christianized people, but did
          not adopt their religion (see [354]Celtic Church In Britain and
          Ireland). The first Christian church among them was Frankish in
          origin and was established in Kent, whose king, Ethelbert (c.
          560-616), married a Christian Princess, Bertha, daughter of
          Charibert, king of Paris. She was granted full freedom of
          religion in her new home, and brought with her to England a
          Christian chaplain, Liudhard by name. A ruined church near
          Canterbury, dating from Roman times (St. Martin's, three
          quarters of a mile east of the present cathedral), was repaired
          for her use.

  Gregory the Great Sends a Mission to Kent.

          The real conversion of the Anglo-Saxons, however, is properly
          regarded as begun by Pope Gregory the Great (590-604). As the
          story goes (Bede, Hist. eccl., ii. 1), while Gregory was still a
          deacon, either in 578 or 585, he saw one day in the slave-market
          at Rome certain boys whose fair complexion, bright faces, and
          golden hair excited his admiration. Inquiring about them, he was
          told that they were Angles; whereupon he exclaimed "No wonder,
          for they have the faces of angels." Informed that they were
          heathen and from Deira, he remarked "From wrath [de ira] they
          must be saved and called to the mercy of Christ. Who is their
          king?" "Ælle," was the reply; and the pun-loving Italian
          concluded, "Alleluia! the praises of God must be sung in those
          parts." Betaking himself to the pope, Gregory asked that he be
          allowed to go in person as missionary to the land of the
          captives, but the Romans would not permit him at that time to
          leave their city. When he became pope, Gregory remembered the
          beautiful captives. He tried to find English boys whom he could
          instruct at Rome and then send to their people; and in 596 he
          despatched a mission of monks to England under the lead of
          Augustine (see [355]Augustine, Saint, of Canterbury). When
          Augustine died (604 or 605) Kent had been converted and the
          gospel had found entrance into Essex. Justus and Mellitus had
          been established as bishops at Rochester (for West Kent) and
          London (for the East-Saxons), respectively. With the consent of
          his witan, Ethelbert promulgated laws recognizing the Church as
          an institution and Christian obligations. A heathen reaction
          followed Ethelbert's death (616), which for a time checked
          further advances from Canterbury (see [356]Justus;
          [357]Laurence; [358]Mellitus).

  Northumbria and Wessex.

          As in Kent, so in Northumbria the way for the introduction of
          Christianity was prepared by the marriage (625) of the king,
          Edwin, with a Christian Princess, Ethelburga, daughter of
          Ethelbert of Kent. She was accompanied to the North by Paulinus,
          who became first bishop of York and converted King Edwin and
          many of his people (see [359]Edwin; [360]Paulinus). The work was
          interrupted and many of its results destroyed in 633, when
          Penda, king of Mercia, a heathen champion, in alliance with the
          Britons of Wales, overthrew and slew Edwin. It was resumed in
          635 by Aidan supported by King Oswald, and was completed by
          their successors (see [361]Aidan, Saint; [362]Oswald, Saint;
          [363]Oswy). At the same time the West-Saxons were gained for
          Christianity by [364]Birinus. The church of Aidan and Oswald,
          however, had no connection with Canterbury or Rome, but was
          organized as a part of the old British or Celtic Church, and
          continued such till the synod of Whitby in 664.

  Mercia and Essex.

          A marriage between Peada, son of Penda and under-king of the
          Middle-Angles, with a Northumbrian princess, daughter of Oswy,
          led to his conversion. He was baptized by Finan, Aidan's
          successor at Lindisfarne, in 653. Finan also baptized (probably
          at the same time) Sigbert, king of Essex, which had relapsed
          into heathenism after the time of Augustine. Peada's conversion
          was followed by that of his people. Four priests of the
          Northumbrian Church, [365]Cedd, Adda, Betti, and Diuma, settled
          in his kingdom, and even Penda did not restrict their preaching.
          Penda, the last powerful pagan ruler, was slain in battle with
          Oswy of Northumbria in 655, and the complete Christianization of
          Mercia soon followed. Diuma was consecrated bishop of Mercia by
          Finan, probably in 656. His see was at Lichfield. About ten
          years later Diuma's third successor, Jaruman, supported by
          Wulfhere, king of Mercia, and Penda's son, completed the
          conversion of Essex, a part of whose people had a second time
          relapsed into heathenism.

  East Anglia.

          Christianity was introduced into East Anglia from Kent; but the
          only result was that the king, Redwald, set up Christian and
          heathen altars side by side. An obscure story connected with the
          conversion of Edwin of Northumbria (Bede, Hist. eccl., ii. 12)
          has led to the conjecture that [366]Paulinus may have been sent
          on a mission to East Anglia before 616. Eorpwald, Redwald's son,
          became a Christian through the influence of Edwin in 627 or 628,
          but in the same year he was killed by a heathen. After three
          years his brother, Sigbert, who had accepted Christianity in
          Gaul, gained the throne, and with the help of [367]Felix, who
          became bishop of Dunwich in 631, evangelized the land.

  Sussex.

          Sussex received the Gospel through the labors of [368]Wilfrid of
          York between 681 and 686, although its king, Ethelwalh, had been
          baptized earlier in Mercia and had made some unsuccessful
          efforts to introduce the Gospel. Its first bishop was Eadbert
          (709).

  The Anglo-Saxon Church.

          The Anglo-Saxon Church, like all churches of the early Middle
          Ages, had in many respects a national character. The wishes of
          the kings determined the appointment of bishops, if indeed the
          kings did not directly name them. Princes and rulers took part
          in synods, and bishops attended the councils of the rulers.
          Kings issued ecclesiastical orders. The Anglo-Saxon tongue was
          heard in divine service, and the baptismal formula also was
          Anglo-Saxon. The Old and New Testaments were read in
          Anglo-Saxon, and old homilies were translated into the
          vernacular. Dioceses were formed according to political
          divisions and were named after peoples rather than towns.

   Angus, Joseph
          ANGUS, JOSEPH: English Baptist; b. at Bolam (15 m. n.w. of
          Newcastle), Northumberland, Jan. 16, 1816; d. at Hampstead,
          London, Aug. 28, 1902. He studied at King's College, London, at
          Stepney Baptist College, and at Edinburgh University (M.A.,
          1838), and became pastor of the New Park Street Baptist Church,
          Southwark, London (1838), co-secretary of the Baptist Missionary
          Society (1840), sole secretary (1842), and President of Stepney
          College (1849), which position he held till 1893. During his
          administration the College was removed to Regent's Park and
          affiliated with the University of London, its attendance
          doubled, its endowment was augmented by a professorial fund of
          £30,000, and scholarships were provided for missionary and other
          students. He was a member of the first London School Board, and
          of the New Testament Revision Company. He published: The
          Voluntary System (London, 1839), a prize essay in reply to the
          lectures of Dr. Chalmers on Church establishments; Christ our
          Life (1853), which won a prize for an essay on the life of
          Christ adapted to missionary purposes and suitable for
          translation into the languages of India; Christian Churches
          (1862); Lectures on Future Punishment (1870); Apostolic Missions
          (1871; new ed. 1892); Six Lectures on Regeneration (1897). He
          wrote the commentary on Hebrews for Schaff's International
          Commentary on the New Testament, New York and Edinburgh (1883).
          For the Religious Tract Society he prepared: Handbooks of the
          Bible (1854; partly rewritten by Samuel G. Green 1904), the
          English Tongue (1862), English Literature (1865); and Specimens
          of English Literature (1866; new ed. 1880). For the same society
          he edited Butler's Analogy (1855), and Sermons (1882), and
          Wayland's Elements of Moral Science (1858).

   Anhalt
          ANHALT: Duchy of the German empire, surrounded, except for a
          short distance on the west, where it touches the duchy of
          Brunswick, by Prussian territory (government districts of
          Magdeburg, Potsdam, Merseburg). Its area is 906 square miles;
          population (1900), 316,000; capital, Dessau. Ninety-six per
          cent. of the people are Protestants; 3 ¼ per cent. are Roman
          Catholics; while the Jews comprise little more than one-half of
          1 per cent. Among the minor Protestant bodies are Irvingite
          congregations in Bernburg and Coswig. The Evangelical State
          Church is a product of the Wittenberg Reformation. During the
          controversies of the later sixteenth century it held fast to the
          original formulas, but remained free from the one-sided tendency
          represented in the Formula of Concord. Attempts to introduce
          certain church practises from the Palatinate, with the
          Heidelberg catechism, toward the close of the sixteenth century
          were ineffectual. The political division into four
          principalities after 1606 favored certain divergencies,--for
          example in Anhalt-Bernburg and Anhalt-Cöthen there was a
          stronger tendency toward Reformed usages and teachings. But in
          1880 a united Church in a united land was formally established;
          and that the union is not nominal but real is shown by the
          freest Christian fellowship, by the adoption of a uniform form
          of divine service, and by the use of the same church books.
          To-day the distinction between Lutheran and Reformed is not
          thought of.

          The Church is legally recognized as a distinct institution,
          independent of the secular government, and the management of its
          internal affairs is entrusted to the consistory, which reports
          directly to the duke. A synod, consisting of the superintendents
          of the five circles into which the land is divided, five members
          named by the duke, and twenty-nine members elected in the
          circles, meets every three years; it has a share in
          ecclesiastical legislation, considers church needs and
          conditions in general, and exercises a control over the funds
          under the administration and at the disposal of the consistory.
          Previous to 1874 the consistory had the chief direction and
          administration of the schools, but in that year a state board of
          education was created. The consistory, however, is represented
          in this board, and the local pastors are generally the
          inspectors of the lower schools. With very few exceptions the
          duke is patron of churches and livings.

          The number of livings in the duchy is 155 with eight secondary
          ones, and there are 212 parishes and 215 churches. A legally
          established pastors' association has three endowed libraries.
          Church music is promoted by an annual course in organ playing in
          Dessau. Seventy-nine parishes have Sunday-schools. The
          contributions for foreign missions average 14,000 marks yearly,
          and for the Gustav Adolf Verein 10,000 marks. The work of the
          Innere Mission is also well supported, and a deaconesses' house
          has been established in Dessau.

   Anicetus
          ANICETUS, an-i-sî´tus: Pope from about 154 to about 165.
          According to the Liber pontificalis (ed. Duchesne, i. 58, 134),
          he was a Syrian by birth. Irenæus (Adversus hæreses, III. iii.
          3-4) mentions him as the successor of Pius I and the Predecessor
          of Soter, and refers to the journey of Polycarp to Rome, which
          took place in Anicetus' pontificate. A fuller account of it is
          given in Irenæus' letter to Victor, of which Eusebius has
          preserved a considerable fragment (Hist. eccl., V, xxiv. 12-17;
          see [371]Polycarp). The dates of Anicetus are uncertain. If
          Polycarp died in 155, the accession of Anicetus must be placed
          in 154, and the assignment of eleven years to his pontificate
          would bring its termination to 165. He is called a martyr in the
          Roman martyrology, as well as by Rabanus Maurus, Florus, and
          others, and is commemorated on Apr. 17.

   Animals

                                    ANIMALS:

I. Regulations Respecting Their Use.

  1. For Food:

          According to the lists (Lev. xi. 1-31, 46-47; Deut. xiv. 1-19),
          the clean animals (i.e., those whose flesh might be eaten) were
          ruminant quadrupeds which parted the hoof, were clovenfooted,
          and chewed the cud; aquatic animals that had fins and scales;
          all birds except the nineteen species specified, which were
          birds of prey or carrion; only those flying insects which, like
          the grasshopper, have two long legs for leaping. No vermin was
          clean, nor was the carcass of any clean animal, if it had died
          naturally, or been torn to death. Everything was unclean that
          touched the unclean; so was the kid seethed in its mother's
          milk, and the heathen sacrifices in all their parts. See
          [372]Dietary Laws of the Hebrews.

  2. For Sacrifice:

          The general rule was, that only the clean animals could be
          offered; this dates back to the pre-Mosaic period (Gen. viii.
          20). Asses, camels, and horses were not offered by the Hebrews.
          But only the tame among even the clean animals could be
          sacrificed; therefore, no animal of the chase. Doves were not
          regarded as wild. Every animal offered must be without blemish
          (Lev. xxii. 20), at least seven days old (verse 27; Ex. xxii.
          30), because too young flesh is disgusting, and therefore
          unclean. Nor must it be too old; for bovines three years, for
          small cattle one, was usual (Ex. xxix. 38; Lev. ix. 3; Num.
          xxviii. 9; Lev. i. 5, "bullock," a young ox). What man might not
          eat, it was profanation to sacrifice. See [373]Defilement and
          Purification, Ceremonial.

II. The Emblematic Use of Animals.

  1. In the Old Testament:

          Locusts were used as the symbol of the divine judgments. The
          twelve oxen which bore the brazen sea in the court of the temple
          (I Kings vii. 25) were doubtless symbolic; the animal shapes
          which appeared in prophetic visions were also symbolic (Ezek. i.
          5-14), and seem to be identified with the cherubim (Ezek. x. 1).

  2. In the New Testament:

          Peter uses a lion as the emblem of Satan (I Pet. v. 8); on the
          other hand, a lion is the emblem of Christ (Rev. v. 5). The ass
          symbolizes peace (Matt. xxi. 5); the dove, innocence and the
          Holy Ghost; the dog and swine, uncleanness and vulgarity (Matt.
          vii. 6; II Pet. ii. 22). But the emblematic use of beasts is
          much greater in Revelation than in all the other books of the
          Bible combined. Constant mention is made of the four living
          creatures (iv. 6, etc.) who were from the fifth century
          considered as symbolizing the four evangelists. Christ is
          constantly called the Lamb. The Devil, the dragon (xii. 3,
          etc.). There are, besides, a beast who comes out of the
          bottomless pit (xi. 7), horses (vi. 2, etc.), locusts (ix. 3),
          birds (xix. 17), and frogs (xvi. 13).

  3. The Ecclesiastical Use of Animals:

          This was very varied. There was not only the lamb for Christ but
          also dolphins, hens, pelicans, apes, and centaurs. The old
          Gothic churches exhibit these fanciful and really heathen
          designs. Bernard of Clairvaux raised his voice against them. In
          the catacombs one finds the drawing of a fish to symbolize
          Christ, because the initials of the title of Christ (Gk. Iesous
          Christos Theou Uios SOter) spell the Greek word for "fish"
          (ichthus). See [374]Symbolism.

III. The Use of Emblematic Animals in Worship:

          Among the Hebrews there are two spoken of. The brazen serpent
          which Moses made, which was at last destroyed by Hezekiah,
          because it was worshiped (II Kings xviii. 4). The golden calf
          was not intended as a substitute for the Yahweh worship, but as
          an aid; but it became a snare to Israel in the wilderness before
          Sinai (Ex. xxxii.) and in the days of Jeroboam I. and his
          successors on the throne of Israel (I Kings xii. 28-30).

   Anna Comnena
          ANNA COMNENA, c?m-nî´n?: A Byzantine princess of both literary
          and political importance, daughter of [379]Alexius Comnenus; b.
          Dec. 2, 1083; d. after 1148. Brought up in a circle of highly
          cultivated women, and betrothed in early youth to the
          heir-presumptive of the empire, the son of the last emperor of
          the house of Ducas, she seemed to have a brilliant future before
          her. But the prince died, and his place was taken later by
          Nicephorus Bryennius, the son of a conquered pretender. It
          became plain that the emperor intended to make Anna's brother
          John his heir, instead of his daughter or her husband. When
          Alexius died (1118), Anna was the soul of a conspiracy against
          John. It failed, and military rule suppressed the court cabals.
          Anna recovered her confiscated property; but on the death of her
          husband, ten years later, she fell gradually into disfavor at
          court and lived much alone, solacing herself by literary
          interests, her taste for which was the result of the brilliant
          literary epoch of which Michael Psellus was the chief
          representative. She wrote a remarkable history of her father's
          reign, with the title Alexias, which professes to be a
          continuation of the unfinished history of the Comneni by her
          husband. Her style is typical of literary classicism, being full
          of quotations from standard authors, and affecting to despise
          the barbarisms of the living tongue. This affectation is carried
          so far that she apologizes for mentioning barbarian names as for
          an offense against the customs of polite society. Allied to this
          is the haughty assertion of the primacy of Byzantium over all
          uncivilized foreigners, whether popes, Turks, or crusaders. Its
          strong personal bias, its prejudice against the two successors
          of Alexius, and its constant revelation of the bitterness of
          disappointed ambition detract from the historical value of the
          work. Yet the wealth of information contained in it makes it the
          principal source for the history of Byzantium at the epoch of
          the first crusade. It is in MPG, cxxxi.; the best edition is by
          A. Reifferscheid, in the Bibliotheca Teubneriana (2 vols.,
          Leipsic, 1884).

   Annas
          ANNAS (called Ananos by Josephus): Jewish high priest, son of
          Seth. He was appointed high priest in 7 A.D. by Quirinius,
          governor of Syria, and retained his office under three
          successive governors, till he was deposed in the year 14 by
          Valerius Gratus. His second successor in the high-priesthood was
          his son Eleazar; the fourth, his son-in-law (John xviii. 13)
          Joseph, called Caiaphas (Matt. xxvi. 3 sqq.), who held the
          office from 18 to 36 A.D. Four other sons of Annas officiated as
          high priests; and as he was called happy for this reason, it may
          be inferred that he lived to see the installation of most of
          them. He was dead at the time of the siege of Jerusalem, and his
          tomb was then shown. According to the New Testament, Annas acted
          as high priest after his deposition; he occupied an influential
          position, and presided at the trial of Jesus. These statements
          are not to be rejected as unhistorical, since high priests who
          were no longer active retained not only their official title but
          also many of the prerogatives of office. That Annas was held in
          high repute beside the acting Caiaphas can be explained from the
          length of his life and from his family relations. The form of
          expression in Luke iii. 2 and Acts iv. 6, where Annas appears as
          an acting high priest, is somewhat incorrect. Like most members
          of the aristocratic high-priestly line, he was a Sadducee (Acts
          iv. 1, 6, v. 17) and Josephus calls his son Annas the Younger, a
          rigid Sadducee. [Josephus (with John xviii. 13) seems to show
          that Annas was the most influential man in Jerusalem for a
          generation.]

   Anne, Saint
          ANNE (ANNA), SAINT: Mother of the Virgin Mary. According to
          apocryphal tradition (Evangelium de nativitate Mariæ and
          Protevangelium Jacobi), she is said to have been born at
          Bethlehem, the daughter of the priest Matthan. She was married
          to the pious Joachim of the tribe of Judah, and for twenty years
          was childless. At her assiduous supplication, an angel foretold
          "that she should conceive and bring forth, and that her seed
          should be praised in the whole world." Joachim too received
          comforting promises from the angel. When the daughter was one
          year old the parents prepared a banquet, and Anna sang a song of
          praise similar to the Magnificat. When three years of age, Mary,
          having been dedicated before her birth to the service of God,
          was brought to Jerusalem by her parents and given to the priests
          to be educated in the Temple. According to later apocryphal
          legends, Joachim died soon after Mary's birth, and Anna, "not
          out of sensual lusts, but at the prompting of the Holy Spirit,"
          married first Cleophas, to whom she bore Mary, the wife of
          Alphæus, and after his death Salomas, by whom she became the
          mother of a third Mary, the wife of Zebedæus. The legend in this
          form, which owes its development to the luxuriant Anne cult of
          the later medieval period, was known to Jean Gerson (d. 1429;
          cf. his Oratio de nativitate virginis Mariæ, Opera, iii. 59).
          Conrad Wimpina (in his Oratio de divæ Annæ trinubio, 1518), as
          well as Johann Eck (in a sermon in vol. iii. of his Homiliæ,
          Paris, 1579), defended the legend.

          Thus the most fantastic excesses of the Anne cult coincide with
          the Reformation epoch, and were defended by Roman Catholic
          theologians of the most different schools,-- not only
          immaculistic Franciscans, but also Dominicans, Carmelites, and
          Augustinian hermits. Even Luther, in his youth, when overtaken
          by a thunderstorm, cried to Anne for help, and vowed, if
          delivered, to become a monk (Köstlin, Leben Luthers, i. 49,
          Berlin, 1893). It was a firm belief in the popular mind of the
          time that Christ's grandmother preserved health, made rich, and
          protected in death. The pictorial representations of the
          fifteenth to the seventeenth century dedicated to Anne are
          almost innumerable as well as the Anne churches. In
          post-Reformation times popes promoted the Anne cult; thus
          Gregory XIII. in 1584 ordered that on July 26, the supposed day
          of Anne's death, a double mass should be said throughout the
          whole Church; and Benedict XIV. in his De festis Mariæ Virginis
          (ii. 9), recommends the veneration of St. Anne. In the Greek
          church St. Anne is also celebrated, partly by festivals (July 25
          in commemoration of her death; Dec. 9, as the day of her
          conception; Sept. 9, as the day of her marriage with Joachim),
          partly by a rich ascetic-homiletical literature, which reaches
          back to Gregory of Nyasa, but without following the later
          medieval legends of Western tradition.

  1. Definition and Classification of Theories.

          A term designating broadly a large body of theories which unite
          in contending that human beings pass, or are put, out of
          existence altogether. These theories fall logically into three
          classes, according as they hold that all souls, being mortal,
          actually cease to exist at death; or that, souls being naturally
          mortal, only those persist in life to which immortality is given
          by God; or that, though souls are naturally immortal and persist
          in existence unless destroyed by a force working upon them from
          without, wicked souls are actually thus destroyed. These three
          classes of theories may be conveniently called respectively, (1)
          pure mortalism, (2) conditional immortality, and (3)
          annihilationism proper.

  2. Pure Mortalism.

          The common contention of the theories which form the first of
          these classes is that human life is bound up with the organism,
          and that therefore the entire man passes out of being with the
          dissolution of the organism. The usual basis of this contention
          is either materialistic or pantheistic or at least pantheizing
          (e.g., realistic); the soul being conceived in the former case
          as but a function of organized matter and necessarily ceasing to
          exist with the dissolution of the organism, in the latter case
          as but the individualized manifestation of a much more extensive
          entity, back into which it sinks with the dissolution of the
          organism in connection with which the individualization takes
          place. Rarely, however, the contention in question is based on
          the notion that the soul, although a spiritual entity distinct
          from the material body, is incapable of maintaining its
          existence separate from the body. The promise of eternal life is
          too essential an element of Christianity for theories like these
          to thrive in a Christian atmosphere. It is even admitted now by
          Stade, Oort, Schwally, and others that the Old Testament, even
          in its oldest strata, presupposes the persistence of life after
          death,--which used to be very commonly denied. Nevertheless, the
          materialists (e.g., Feuerbach, Vogt, Moleschott, Büchner,
          Häckel), and pantheists (Spinoza, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel,
          Strauss; cf. S. Davidson, Doctrine of the Last Things, London,
          1882, pp. 132-133), still deny the possibility of immortality;
          and in exceedingly wide circles, even among those who would not
          wholly break with Christianity, men permit themselves to cherish
          nothing more than a "hope" of it (S. Hoekstra, De hoop der
          onsterfelijkheid, Amsterdam, 1867; L. W. E. Rauwenhoff,
          Wijsbegeerte van den Godsdienst, Leyden, 1887, p. 811; cf. the
          "Ingersoll Lectures").

  3. Conditional Immortality.

          The class of theories to which the designation of "conditional
          immortality" is most properly applicable, agree with the
          theories of pure mortalism in teaching the natural mortality of
          man in his entirety, but separate from them in maintaining that
          this mortal may, and in many cases does, put on immortality.
          Immortality in their view is a gift of God, conferred on those
          who have entered into living communion with him. Many theorists
          of this class adopt frankly the materialistic doctrine of the
          soul, and deny that it is a distinct entity; they therefore
          teach that the soul necessarily dies with the body, and identify
          life beyond death with the resurrection, conceived as
          essentially a recreation of the entire man. Whether all men are
          subjects of this recreative resurrection is a mooted question
          among themselves. Some deny it, and affirm therefore that the
          wicked perish finally at death, the children of God alone
          attaining to resurrection. The greater part, however, teach a
          resurrection for all, and a "second death," which is
          annihilation, for the wicked (e.g., Jacob Blain, Death not Life,
          Buffalo, 1857, pp. 39-42; Aaron Ellis and Thomas Read, Bible
          versus Tradition, New York, 1853, pp. 13-121; George Storrs, Six
          Sermons, ib. 1856, p. 29; Zenas Campbell, The Age of Gospel
          Light, Hartford, 1854). There are many, on the other hand, who
          recognize that the soul is a spiritual entity, disparate to,
          though conjoined in personal union with, the body. In their
          view, however, ordinarily at least, the soul requires the body
          either for its existence, or certainly for its activity. C. F.
          Hudson, for example (Debt and Grace, New York, 1861, pp.
          263-264), teaches that the soul lies unconscious, or at least
          inactive, from death to the resurrection; then the just rise to
          an ecstasy of bliss; the unjust, however, start up at the voice
          of God to become extinct in the very act. Most, perhaps, prolong
          the second life of the wicked for the purpose of the infliction
          of their merited punishment; and some make their extinction a
          protracted process (e.g., H. L. Hastings, Retribution or the
          Doom of the Ungodly, Providence, 1861, pp. 77, 153; cf. Horace
          Bushnell, Forgiveness and Law, New York, 1874, p.147, notes 5
          and 6; James Martineau, A Study of Religion, ii., Oxford, 1888,
          p. 114). For further discussion of the theory of conditional
          immortality, see [382]Immortality.

  4. Annihilationism Proper.

          Already, however, in speaking of extinction we are passing
          beyond the limits of "conditionalism" pure and simple and
          entering the region of annihilationism proper. Whether we think
          of this extinction as the result of the punishment or as the
          gradual dying out of the personality under the enfeebling
          effects of sin, we are no longer looking at the soul as
          naturally mortal and requiring a new gift of grace to keep it in
          existence, but as naturally immortal and suffering destruction
          at the hands of an inimical power. And this becomes even more
          apparent when the assumed mortalism of the soul is grounded not
          in its nature but in its sinfulness; so that the theory deals
          not with souls as such, but with sinful souls, and it is a
          question of salvation by a gift of grace to everlasting life or
          of being left to the disintegrating effects of sin. The point of
          distinction between theories of this class and "conditionalism"
          is that these theories with more or less consistency or
          heartiness recognize what is called the "natural immortality of
          the soul," and are not tempted therefore to think of the soul as
          by nature passing out of being at death (or at any time), and
          yet teach that the actual punishment inflicted upon or suffered
          by the wicked results in extinction of being. They may differ
          among themselves, as to the time when this extinction takes
          place,--whether at death, or at the general judgment,--or as to
          the more or less extended or intense punishment accorded to the
          varying guilt of each soul. They may differ also as to the means
          by which the annihilation of the wicked soul is
          accomplished,--whether by a mere act of divine power, cutting
          off the sinful life, or by the destructive fury of the
          punishment inflicted, or by the gradual enervating and sapping
          working of sin itself on the personality. They retain their
          common character as theories of annihilation proper so long as
          they conceive the extinction of the soul as an effect wrought on
          it to which it succumbs, rather than as the natural exit of the
          soul from a life which could be continued to it only by some
          operation upon it raising it to a higher than its natural
          potency.

  5. Mingling of Theories.

          It must be borne in mind that the adherents of these two classes
          of theories are not very careful to keep strictly within the
          logical limits of one of the classes. Convenient as it is to
          approach their study with a definite schematization in hand, it
          is not always easy to assign individual writers with
          definiteness to one or the other of them. It has become usual,
          therefore, to speak of them all as annihilationists or of them
          all as conditionalists; annihilationists because they all agree
          that the souls of the wicked cease to exist; conditionalists
          because they all agree that therefore persistence in life is
          conditioned on a right relation to God. Perhaps the majority of
          those who call themselves conditionalists allow that the
          mortality of the soul, which is the prime postulate of the
          conditionalist theory, is in one way or another connected with
          sin; that the souls of the wicked persist in existence after
          death and even after the judgment, in order to receive the
          punishment due their sin; and that this punishment, whether it
          be conceived as infliction from without or as the simple
          consequence of sin, has much to do with their extinction. When
          so held, conditionalism certainly falls little short of
          annihilationism proper.

  6. Early History of Annihilationistic Theories.

          Some confusion has arisen, in tracing the history of the
          annihilationist theories, from confounding with them
          enunciations by the earlier Church Fathers of the essential
          Christian doctrine that the soul is not self-existent, but owes,
          as its existence, so its continuance in being, to the will of
          God. The earliest appearance of a genuinely annihilationist
          theory in extant Christian literature is to be found apparently
          in the African apologist Arnobius, at the opening of the fourth
          century (cf. Salmond, pp. 473-474; Falke, pp. 27-28). It seemed
          to him impossible that beings such as men could either owe their
          being directly to God or persist in being without a special gift
          of God; the unrighteous must therefore be gradually consumed in
          the fires of Gehenna. A somewhat similar idea was announced by
          the Socinians in the sixteenth century (O. Fock, Der
          Socinianismus, Kiel, 1847, pp. 714 sqq.). On the positive side,
          Faustus Socinus himself thought that man is mortal by nature and
          attains immortality only by grace. On the negative side, his
          followers (Crell, Schwaltz, and especially Ernst Sohner) taught
          explicitly that the second death consists in annihilation, which
          takes place, however, only after the general resurrection, at
          the final judgment. From the Socinians this general view passed
          over to England where it was adopted, not merely, as might have
          been anticipated, by men like Locke (Reasonableness of
          Christianity, § 1), Hobbes (Leviathan), and Whiston, but also by
          Churchmen like Hammond and Warburton, and was at least played
          with by non-conformist leaders like Isaac Watts. The most
          remarkable example of its utilization in this age, however, is
          supplied by the non-juror Henry Dodwell (1706). Insisting that
          the "soul is a principle naturally mortal," Dodwell refused to
          allow the benefit of this mortality to any but those who lived
          and died without the limits of the proclamation of the Gospel;
          no "adult person whatever," he insisted, "living where
          Christianity is professed, and the motives of its credibility
          are sufficiently proposed, can hope for the benefit of actual
          mortality." Those living in Christian lands are therefore all
          immortalized, but in two classes: some "by the pleasure of God
          to punishment," some "to reward by their union with the divine
          baptismal Spirit." It was part of his contention that "none have
          the power of giving this divine immortalizing Spirit since the
          apostles but the bishops only," so that his book was rather a
          blast against the antiprelatists than a plea for
          annihilationism; and it was replied to as such by Samuel Clarke
          (1706), Richard Baxter (1707), and Daniel Whitby (1707). During
          the eighteenth century the theory was advocated also on the
          continent of Europe (e.g., E. J. E. Walter, Prüfung einiger
          wichtigen Lehren theologisches und philosophisches Inhalts,
          Berlin, 1782), and almost found a martyr in the Neuchatel
          pastor, Ferdinand Olivier Petitpierre, commonly spoken of by the
          nickname of "No Eternity" (cf. C. Berthoud, Les Quatre
          Petitpierres, Neuchatel, 1875). In the first half of the
          nineteenth century also it found sporadic adherents, as e.g., C.
          H. Weisse in Germany (TSK, ix., 1836, 271-340) and H. H. Dobney
          in England (Notes of Lectures on Future Punishment, London,
          1844; new ed., On the Scripture Doctrine of Future Punishment,
          1846).

  7. Nineteenth Century Theories.

          The real extension of the theory belongs, however, only to the
          second half of the nineteenth century. During this period it
          attained, chiefly through the able advocacy of it by C. F.
          Hudson and E. White, something like a popular vogue in
          English-speaking lands. In French-speaking countries, while
          never becoming really popular, it has commanded the attention of
          an influential circle of theologians and philosophers (as J.
          Rognon, L'Immortalité native et l'enseignement biblique, Paris,
          1894, p. 7; but cf. A. Gretillat, Exposé de théologie
          systématique, IV., 1892, p. 602). In Germany, on the other hand,
          it has met with less acceptance, although it is precisely there
          that it has been most scientifically developed, and has received
          the adherence of the most outstanding names. Before the opening
          of this half century in fact it had gained the great support of
          Richard Rothe's advocacy (Theologische Ethik, 2 vols.,
          Wittenberg, 1845-47; 2d ed., 1867-72, §§ 470-472; Dogmatik,
          iii., Heidelberg, 1870, §§ 47-48, especially p. 158), and never
          since has it ceased to find adherents of mark, who base their
          acceptance of it sometimes on general grounds, but increasingly
          on the view that the Scriptures teach, not a doctrine of the
          immortality of the soul, but a reanimation by resurrection of
          God's people. The chief names in this series are C. H. Weisse
          (Philosophische Dogmatik, Leipsic, 1853-62, § 970); Hermann
          Schultz (Voraussetzungen der christlichen Lehre der
          Unsterblichkeit, Göttingen, 1861, p. 155; cf. Grundriss der
          evangelischen Dogmatik, 1892, p. 154: "This condemnation of the
          second death may in itself, according to the Bible, be thought
          of as existence in torment, or as painful cessation of
          existence. Dogmatics without venturing to decide, will find the
          second conception the more probable, biblically and
          dogmatically"); H. Plitt (Evangelische Glaubenslehre, Gotha,
          1863); F. Brandes, (TSK, 1872, pp. 545, 550); A. Schäffer (Auf
          der Neige des Lebens, Gotha, 1884; Was ist Glück? 1891, pp.
          290-294); G. Runze (Unsterblichkeil und Auferstehung, i.,
          Berlin, 1894, pp. 167, 204: "Christian Eschatology teaches not a
          natural immortality for the soul, but a reanimation by God's
          almighty power . . . . The Christian hope of reanimation makes
          the actualization of a future blessed existence depend entirely
          on faith in God"); L. Lemme (Endlosigkeit der Verdammnis,
          Berlin; 1898, pp. 31-32, 60-61); cf. R. Kabisch (Die
          Eschatologie des Paulus, Göttingen, 1893).

          The same general standpoint has been occupied in Holland, e.g.,
          by Jonker (Theologische Studien, i.). The first advocate of
          conditionalism in French was the Swiss pastor, E.
          Pétavel-Olliff, whose first book, La Fin du mal, appeared in
          1872 (Paris), followed by many articles in the French
          theological journals and by Le Problème de l'immortalité (1891;
          Eng. transl., London, 1892), and The Extinction of Evil (Eng.,
          1889). In 1880 C. Byse issued a translation of E. White's chief
          book. The theory not only had already been presented by A. Bost,
          (Le Sort des méchants, 1861), but had been taken up by
          philosophers of such standing as C. Lambert (Système du monde
          moral 1862), P. Janet (RDM, 1863), and C. Renouvier (La Critique
          philosophique, 1878); and soon afterward Charles Sécretan and C.
          Ribot (RT, 1885 no. 1) expressed their general adherence to it.
          Perhaps the more distinguished advocacy of it on French ground
          has come, however, from the two professors Sabatier, Auguste and
          Armand, the one from the point of view of exegetical, the other
          from that of natural science. Says the one (L'Origine du péché
          dans le système théologique de Paul, Paris, 1887, p. 38): "The
          impenitent sinner never emerges from the fleshly state, and
          consequently remains subject to the law of corruption and
          destruction, which rules fleshly beings; they perish and are as
          if they had never been." Says the other (Essai sur l'immortalité
          au point de vue du naturalisme évolutionniste, 2d ed., Paris,
          1895, pp. 198, 229): "The immortality of man is not universal
          and necessary; it is subject to certain conditions, it is
          conditional, to use an established expression."
          "Ultraterrestrial immortality will be the exclusive lot of souls
          which have arrived at a sufficient degree of integrity and
          cohesion to escape absorption or disintegration."

  8. English Advocates.

          The chief English advocate of conditional immortality has
          undoubtedly been Edward White whose Life in Christ was published
          first in 1846 (London), rewritten in 1875 (3d ed., 1878). His
          labors were seconded, however, not only by older works of
          similar tendency such as George Storrs's Are the Wicked
          Immortal? (21st ed., New York, 1852), but by later teaching from
          men of the standing of Archbishop Whately (Scripture Revelation
          Respecting the Future State, 8th ed., London, 1859), Bishop
          Hampden, J. B. Heard (The Tripartite Nature of Man, 5th ed.,
          Edinburgh, 1852), Prebendary Constable (The Duration and Nature
          of Future Punishment, London, 1868), Prebendary Row (Future
          Retribution, London, 1887), J. M. Denniston (The Perishing Soul,
          2d ed., London, 1874), S. Minton (The Glory of Christ, London,
          1868), J. W. Barlow (Eternal Punishment, Cambridge, 1865), and
          T. Davis (Endless Suffering not the Doctrine of Scripture,
          London, 1866). Less decisive but not less influential advocacy
          has been given to the theory also by men like Joseph Parker, R.
          W. Dale, and J. A. Beet (The Last Things, London, 1897). Mr.
          Beet (who quotes Clemance, Future Punishment, London, 1880, as
          much of his way of thinking) occupies essentially the position
          of Schultz. "The sacred writers," he says, "while apparently
          inclining sometimes to one and sometimes to the other, do not
          pronounce decisive judgment" between eternal punishment and
          annihilation (p. 216), while annihilation is free from
          speculative objections. In America C. F. Hudson's initial
          efforts (Debt and Grace, Boston, 1857, 5th ed., 1889; Christ Our
          Life, 1860) were ably seconded by W. R. Huntington (Conditional
          Immortality, New York, 1878) and J. H. Pettingell (The Life
          Everlasting, Philadelphia, 1882, combining two previously
          published tractates; The Unspeakable Gift, Yarmouth, Me., 1884).
          Views of much the same character have been expressed also by
          Horace Bushnell, L. W. Bacon, L. C. Baker, Lyman Abbott, and
          without much insistence on them by Henry C. Sheldon (System of
          Christian Doctrine, Cincinnati, 1903, pp. 573 sqq.).

  9. Modifications of the Theory.

          There is a particular form of conditionalism requiring special
          mention which seeks to avoid the difficulties of
          annihilationism, by teaching, not the total extinction of the
          souls of the wicked, but rather, as it is commonly phrased,
          their "transformation" into impersonal beings incapable of moral
          action, or indeed of any feeling. This is the form of
          conditionalism which is suggested by James Martineau (A Study of
          Religion, ii., Oxford, 1888, p. 114) and by Horace Bushnell
          (Forgiveness and law, New York, 1874, p. 147, notes 5 and 6). It
          is also hinted by Henry Drummond (Natural Law in the Spiritual
          World, London, 1874), when he supposes the lost soul to lose not
          salvation merely but the capacity for it and for God; so that
          what is left is no longer fit to be called a soul, but is a
          shrunken, useless organ ready to fall away like a rotten twig.
          The Alsatian theologian A. Schäffer (Was ist Glück?, Gotha,
          1891, pp. 290-294) similarly speaks of the wicked soul losing
          the light from heaven, the divine spark which gave it its value,
          and the human personality thereby becoming obliterated. "The
          forces out of which it arises break up and become at last again
          impersonal. They do not pass away, but they are transformed."
          One sees the conception here put forward at its highest level in
          such a view as that presented by Prof. O. A. Curtis (The
          Christian Faith, New York, 1905, p. 467), which thinks of the
          lost not, to be sure, as "crushed into mere thinghood" but as
          sunk into a condition "below the possibility of any moral action
          or moral concern . . . like persons in this life whose
          personality is entirely overwhelmed by the base sense of what we
          call physical fear." There is no annihilation in Prof. Curtis's
          view; not even relief for the lost from suffering; but it may
          perhaps be looked at as marking the point where the theories of
          annihilationism reach up to and melt at last into the doctrine
          of eternal punishment.

   Anniversarius
          ANNIVERSARIUS (sc. dies), ANNIVERSARIUM: A day or service in
          memory of a deceased person. From the second century it was
          usual in Christian congregations to celebrate the death-days of
          their martyrs with divine service as they recurred annually.
          Families also used to commemorate their departed members on
          their death-days. From this custom arose the festivals of the
          martyrs and saints, as also those anniversaries for departed
          members of the congregations which are still held in the Roman
          Catholic Church, and consist in masses and alms provided for by
          special endowments.

   Anno
          ANNO: Archbishop of Cologne; b. probably 1010; d. at Cologne
          Dec. 4, 1075. He came of a noble Swabian family, received his
          education at Bamberg, and, through the favor of Emperor Henry
          III., attained the dignities of dean of Goslar and archbishop of
          Cologne (1056). After the death of Henry III. (1056) and the
          accession of his infant son, Henry IV., under the regency of his
          mother Agnes of Poitou, Anno exercised considerable influence at
          court, and took part in the contest which broke out between the
          empire and Rome. The lack of capacity for the duties of
          government revealed by the queen-regent led to the formation of
          a conspiracy in 1062, under the leadership of Anno, who in the
          same year made himself master of the young king's person and
          thereby became virtual ruler of the empire. Desire for personal
          aggrandizement restrained him from making use of his power for
          the interests of Germany in the quarrel with the papacy, which
          now entered upon an acute phase. Upon the death of Pope Nicholas
          II. (1061) the party hostile to German influence, under the
          leadership of Hildebrand, had chosen as his successor Anselm of
          Lucca, who assumed the title of Alexander II. In opposition the
          imperial party had raised to the papal office Cadalus of Parma
          under the name of Honorius II. A synod at Augsburg, summoned in
          1062 to decide on the conflicting claims of the two candidates,
          rendered a temporary decision in favor of Alexander II.; and two
          years later a second synod, at Mantua, made formal
          acknowledgment of Alexander's rights. Anno, who was in complete
          control at Augsburg, was actuated in this course, so seemingly
          hostile to the welfare of the empire, by the desire to preserve
          in his hands the balance of power between the papal and imperial
          forces and thus to secure for himself the role of arbiter
          between the two. When the council of Mantua assembled, however,
          his influence had undergone serious diminution and he was unable
          to prevent the confirmation of the Italian pope. A strong rival
          for power now appeared in the person of Adalbert, archbishop of
          Hamburg-Bremen (see [384]Adalbert of Hamburg-Bremen), with whom
          Anno was compelled to share his authority over the young king
          (1063). Two years later the archbishop of Cologne found himself
          almost entirely superseded.

          The fall of Adalbert in 1066 brought Anno once more to the front
          for a brief time, but he never again exercised the authority he
          had formerly possessed. The last years of his life were
          embittered by quarrels with Rome, by a rising of the citizens of
          Cologne which he suppressed with extreme severity, and by
          charges of treasonable correspondence with William I. of
          England, for which there seems to have been little foundation.
          There was not wanting in the worldly prelate a certain ascetic
          austerity which the misfortunes of his later years tended to
          accentuate, giving him a posthumous reputation of great
          holiness, and in 1183 he was canonized.

   Annulus Piscatoris
          ANNULUS PISCATORIS, an´yu-lus pis-k?-tO´ris: The official ring
          worn by the popes. Every Roman Catholic bishop wears a ring,
          which symbolizes that he is wedded to his diocese. This custom
          dates from very early times, and is mentioned by Isidore of
          Seville, who calls the ring signum pontificalis honoris. The
          ring worn by a pope is engraved with a representation of St.
          Peter fishing--whence its special name--and with the title of
          the pontiff. From the fifteenth century papal briefs have been
          sealed with this ring, and are accordingly said to be given
          "under the seal of the fisherman." At the present time, instead
          of this seal, an imprint of the same device in red ink is more
          commonly used. The ring is given to the newly elected pontiff in
          the conclave by the cardinal camerlingo, and is broken on the
          death of the pope.

   Annunciation, Feast of the
          ANNUNCIATION, FEAST OF THE: A festival celebrated in the Greek,
          Roman Catholic, and Anglican churches on Mar. 25, in
          commemoration of the beginning of the incarnation (Luke i.
          26-38). Though Augustine mentions the date of the event as nine
          months before Christmas, the earliest indisputable evidence for
          the celebration of the feast is furnished by Proclus, patriarch
          of Constantinople, who died before the middle of the fifth
          century. The probable date of its origin is about the end of the
          fourth century. The Council of Toledo (656) ordered its
          observance on Dec. 18, objecting to its celebration in the
          mournful season of Lent; and the church of Milan kept it on the
          fourth Sunday in Advent; but the Roman date finally prevailed
          throughout the West. The ancient Roman year having commenced
          with March, on the twenty-fifth of which month the vernal
          equinox fell in the Julian calendar, it was natural for
          Christian countries to date their years from the feast which
          commemorated the initial step in the work of redemption; in some
          parts of England and the United States this date is still the
          legal term from which leases, etc. are reckoned.

   Annunciation, Orders of the
          ANNUNCIATION, ORDERS OF THE (ANNUNCIADES): Five Roman Catholic
          congregations, two for men and three for women, have their name
          from the annunciation to the Virgin Mary (Luke i. 26-38). (1)
          The highest knightly order of the house of Savoy (now the ruling
          house of Italy): As the spiritual order of the "Knights of the
          Collar" it was founded by Count Amadeus VI. in 1362, and was
          specially favored by Amadeus VIII. (Pope Felix V.; d. 1451). In
          1518 under Charles III. it was dedicated to Santa Maria
          Annunziata. Later it became a secular order of merit and
          nobility. (2) The "Archbrothers of the Annunciation": Founded
          about 1460 by Cardinal Johannes de Turrecremata (Juan de
          Torquemada) in the Church of Santa Maria sopra Minerva at Rome;
          it had importance only for that church. (3) The "Annunciades of
          Santa Marcellina" (or of St. Ambrose): Founded in Genoa in 1408
          for the care of the sick and the performance of like deeds of
          charity. Their most famous member was the ascetic and mystical
          writer Catharina Fieschi-Adorno who died in 1510 (see
          [386]Catharine, Saint, of Genoa). (4) The "Blue Annunciades"
          (Annuntiatæ cælestes; Italian, Turchine, from turchina,
          "turquoise"; so called from the color of their cloak): Founded
          in 1604 by the pious Maria Vittoria Fornari, a widow of Genoa.
          In the seventeenth century they had more than fifty convents,
          mostly in upper Italy. (5) The Religieuses Annonciades (known
          also as the "Order of the Ten Virtues of the Holy Virgin"):
          Founded about 1498 by Jeanne de Valois, Queen of France, and her
          confessor, Gilbert Nicolai. At one time they had forty-five
          convents in France and Belgium. The order was destroyed by the
          French Revolution.

   Anrich, Gustav Adolf
          ANRICH, GUSTAV ADOLF: German Lutheran; b. at Runzenheim (a
          village of Lower Alsace) Dec. 2, 1867. He was educated at the
          universities of Strasburg, Marburg, and Berlin, and in 1894
          became privat docent at Strasburg. He was pastor at Lingolsheim,
          Lower Alsace, from 1896 to 1901, when he became director of the
          Theologischer Studienstift, Strasburg. Since 1903 he has been
          associate professor of church history at Strasburg. He has
          written Das antike Mysterienwesen in seinem Verhältniss zum
          Christentum (Göttingen, 1894); Clemens und Origenes als
          Begründer der Lehre vom Fegefeuer (Tübingen, 1902); and has

          of E. Lucius (1904).

   Ansegis
          ANSEGIS, an-sê´jis (abbreviated form of Ansegisil): 1. The Elder
          Ansegis: Abbot of Fontanella (St. Wandrille, 15 m. n.n.w. of
          Rouen); b. in the latter part of the eighth century; d. at
          Fontanella July 20, 833. He received his first instruction in a
          cloister-school in the diocese of Lyons, became a monk in the
          monastery of Fontanella, and was made abbot of St. Germain de
          Flay, in the diocese of Beauvais, in 807. His energy and good
          management attracted the notice of Charlemagne, who called him
          to his court of Aix-la-Chapelle, and put him with Einhard in
          charge of his building operations. Louis the Pious also held him
          in great favor, and endowed him in 817 with the abbey of
          Luxeuil, and in 823 with that of Fontanella. Here he published
          his collection of Frankish laws, Libri iv. capitularium regum
          Francorum, which in 829 obtained official authority. Most of
          these capitularia can be compared with the original documents,
          and the comparison shows that Ansegis altered very little in the
          text; but Benedict of Mainz (Benedictus Levita), who, twenty
          years later, continued the work, made arbitrary, not to say
          fraudulent, alterations. In the ninth century the work was
          translated into German, and up to the thirteenth century the
          German kings took an oath on the book as containing the rights
          of the realm.

          2. The Younger Ansegis became archbishop of Sens in 872; d. Nov.
          25, 882. In 876 he was appointed papal vicar in Gaul and
          Germany, with the right to convoke synods and to act as the
          representative of the pope in all affairs of the Church. At the
          synod of Ponthion (876), however, a number of the Frankish
          bishops refused to acknowledge his authority, and nothing is
          heard of a real activity on his part as papal vicar. In 877 he
          seems to have lost the confidence of the pope, and in the
          following year another papal vicar was appointed. On his
          tombstone he is called Primus Gallorum Papa, and up to the
          fifteenth century the Archbishop of Sens was styled Galliæ et
          Germanorum Primas.

   Anselm, Saint, of Canterbury
          ANSELM, SAINT, OF CANTERBURY: The father of medieval
          scholasticism and one of the most eminent of English prelates;
          b. at Aosta, Piedmont, 1033; d. at Canterbury, England, Apr. 21,
          1109. He was well-born and his parents were wealthy. While still
          a boy he wished to be a monk, but his father--a harsh man and
          unkind to his son--forbade; his mother, a good and devout woman,
          had died early. When about twenty-three Anselm left home, and,
          after three years in Burgundy and France, went to Bec in
          Normandy, where his celebrated countryman, Lanfranc, was prior.
          Here he became a monk (1060). He succeeded Lanfranc as prior in
          1063, and became abbot in 1078. The abbey had possessions in
          England, which called Anselm frequently to that country. He was
          the general choice for archbishop of Canterbury when Lanfranc
          died (1089), but the king, William Rufus, preferred to keep the
          office vacant, and apply its revenues to his own use. In 1093
          William fell ill and, thinking his end near, literally forced
          Anselm to receive an appointment at his hands. He was
          consecrated Dec. 4 of that year. The next four years witnessed a
          continual struggle between king and archbishop over money
          matters, rights, and privileges. Anselm wished to carry his case
          to Rome, and in 1097, with much difficulty, obtained permission
          from the king to go. At Rome he was honored and flattered, but
          he obtained little practical help in his struggle with the king.
          He returned to England as soon as he heard of the death of
          William (1100), and at the earnest request of the new king,
          Henry. But a difficulty at once arose over lay investiture and
          homage from clerics for their benefices. Though a mild and meek
          man, Anselm had adopted the Gregorian views of the relation
          between Church and State, and adhered to them with the
          steadiness of conscientious conviction. The king, though
          inclined to be conciliatory, was equally firm from motives of
          self-interest. He had a high regard for Anselm, always treated
          him with much consideration, and personal relations between them
          were generally friendly. Nevertheless there was much vexatious
          disputing, several fruitless embassies were sent to Rome, and
          Anselm himself went thither in 1103, remaining abroad till 1106.
          His quarrel with the king was settled by compromise in 1107, and
          the brief remaining period of his life was peaceful, though
          clouded by failing bodily powers. He was canonized in 1494.

          Anselm is one of the most attractive characters of the medieval
          Church. He was preeminently a scholar, and considered the
          monastic life the happiest and best. When duty called, however,
          he did not shrink from assuming the burdens of administration
          and from mixing in the turmoils of statecraft, and he proved
          that steadfast rectitude is as efficacious as the devious ways
          of politicians. His honesty and simplicity were sometimes found
          embarrassing by diplomatic pontiffs and time-serving bishops. He
          was unfeignedly humble, kind of heart, and charitable in
          judgment, of spotless integrity, as zealous in good works as in
          the performance of duty, patient under trial and adversity. He
          was skilful in winning and training the young, achieved marked
          success as a teacher, and the common people were always on his
          side. In the history of theology he stands as the father of
          orthodox scholasticism, and has been called "the second
          Augustine." His mind was keen and logical, and his writings
          display profundity, originality, and masterly grasp of
          intellect. Of the two theological tendencies occupying the field
          in his time--the one, more free and rational, represented by
          Berengar of Tours; the other, confining itself more closely to
          the tradition of the Church, and represented by Lanfranc--he
          chose the latter; and he defines the object of scholastic
          theology to be the logical development and dialectic
          demonstration of the doctrines of the Church as handed down
          through the Fathers. The dogmas of the Church are to him
          identical with revelation itself; and their truth surpasses the
          conceptions of reason so far that it is mere vanity to doubt a
          dogma on account of its unintelligibility. Credo ut intelligam,
          non quæro intelligere ut credam, is the principle on which he
          proceeds; and after him it has become the principle of all
          orthodox theology. As a metaphysician Anselm was a realist, and
          one of his earliest works, De fide Trinitatis, was an attack on
          the doctrine of the Trinity as expounded by the nominalist
          Roscelin. His most celebrated works are the Monologium and
          Proslogium, both aiming to prove the existence and nature of
          God; and the Cur deus homo, in which he develops views of
          atonement and satisfaction which are still held by orthodox
          theologians. The two first-named were written at Bec; the last
          was begun in England "in great tribulation of heart," and
          finished at Schiavi, a mountain village of Apulia, where Anselm
          enjoyed a few months of rest in 1098. His meditations and
          prayers are edifying and often highly impressive.

          [In the Monologium he argues that from the idea of being there
          follows the idea of a highest and absolute, i.e. self-existent
          Being, from which all other being derives its existence--a
          revival of the ancient cosmological argument. In the Proslogium
          the idea of the perfect being--"than which nothing greater can
          be thought"--can not be separated from its reality as existing.
          For if the idea of the perfect Being, thus present in
          consciousness, lacked existence, a still more perfect Being
          could be thought, of which existence would be a necessary
          metaphysical predicate, and thus the most perfect Being would be
          the absolutely Real. The argument is significant, partly as
          showing the profound influence of Realism over Anselm's thought,
          and partly as revealing him to be the first to enter upon the
          perilous transcendent pathway of the ontological argument, to be
          followed by Descartes (Meditationes), Hegel and his school, and
          especially J. Caird (Philosophy of Religion, New York, 1881, pp.
          153-159. For criticism of the ontological argument, cf. Kant,
          Critique of the Pure Reason, New York, 1881, pp. 500 sqq.,
          Ueberweg, History of Philosophy, i., New York, 1873, pp.
          383-386).

          The key to Anselm's theory of the Atonement (see [390]Atonement)
          was the idea of "satisfaction." In justice to himself and to the
          creation, God, whose honor had suffered injury by man's sin,
          must react against it either by punishing men, or, since he was
          merciful, by an equivalent satisfaction viz., the death of the
          God-man, which will more than compensate for the injury to his
          honor, on the ground of which he forgives sin. Incidental
          features of his theory are--sin as a violation of a private
          relation between God and man, the interaction of the divine
          righteousness and grace, and the necessity of a representative
          suffering. In the Reformed doctrine, sin and the Atonement took
          on more of a public character, the active obedience of Christ
          was also emphasized, and the representative relation of Christ
          to the law brought to the front. In the seventeenth century the
          forensic and penal justice of God came into prominence; Christ
          was conceived of as suffering the punishment of our sin,--a
          complete equivalent of the punishment which we must have
          suffered,--on the ground of which our guilt and punishment are
          pardoned. In the following century, Owen (Works, ix. 253-254)
          held that the sufferings of Christ for sinners were not tantidem
          but idem. In more recent discussions along this line, Hodge
          (Systematic Theology, ii. 480-495) maintains that Christ
          suffered neither the kind nor degree of that which sinners must
          have suffered, but any kind and degree of suffering which is
          judicially inflicted in satisfaction of justice and law. There
          has indeed been no theory of the work of Christ which has not
          conceived of it as a satisfaction; even the so-called moral
          influence theories center in this idea (cf. W. N. Clarke,
          Outline of Christian Theology, New York, 1898, pp. 348, 349). It
          is therefore evident how fundamental is the idea of satisfaction
          presented by Anselm. Only it must be observed first that in the
          evolution of the Christian doctrine of salvation the particular
          way in which the satisfaction was realized has been differently
          conceived; and secondly, if the forgiveness of sin in Jesus
          Christ takes place only when the ethical nature of God is
          satisfied, the special form in which the satisfaction is
          accomplished is of subordinate importance. In one class of
          views--the representative or juridical--the satisfaction was
          conditioned on a unique and isolated divine-human deed--the
          death or the life and death of Christ; in the other theories,
          the satisfaction is threefold--in the expression of the divine
          good-will, through the life and death of Christ, in the initial
          response of sinners to forgiving grace, and in the final
          bringing of all souls to perfect union with the Father. Cf. C.
          A. Beckwith, Realities of Christian Theology, Boston, 1906, pp.
          226-229. For criticism of Anselm on the Atonement, cf. Harnack,

   Anselm of Havelberg
          ANSELM OF HAVELBERG: Bishop of Havelberg, later archbishop of
          Ravenna; d. 1158. He took an active part in ecclesiastical and
          still more in political affairs under the emperors from Lothair
          III. to Frederick I. Having joined the Premonstrants he went to
          Magdeburg, probably influenced by Norbert, who consecrated him
          in 1129 bishop of Havelberg. As such he labored zealously for
          the order, to whose duties especially belonged the organization
          of the church in the Wendic countries, and founded a
          Premonstrant chapter in Havelberg. In 1135 Lothair III. sent him
          as ambassador to Constantinople in the hope of effecting a union
          against Roger of Sicily. He held a friendly conference on the
          principal points of controversy between the Eastern and the
          Western Churches, with the archbishop of Nicomedia, and
          afterward at the request of Pope Eugenius III. wrote three
          "Dialogues," descriptive of it. In 1147 he took part as papal
          legate in the crusade against the Wends, and then devoted
          several years to the affairs of his bishopric. The Emperor
          Frederick I. employed him again on political missions; he sent
          him to Constantinople in 1154, when he wished to secure a Greek
          princess for his wife, and in 1155 caused him to be chosen
          archbishop of Ravenna. In the same year Anselm was successful in
          mediating between Frederick and the Pope (Giesebrecht, v. 59,
          64). His writings, besides the one mentioned above, treat
          especially of the relation between canons and monks, which was
          much discussed in his time. They are in MPL, clxxxviii.

   Anselm of Laon
          ANSELM OF LAON (Lat. Laudunensis; called also Scholasticus):
          Archdeacon of Laon; b. at Laon about the middle of the eleventh
          century; d. there July 15, 1117. He enjoyed the instruction of
          Anselm of Canterbury at Bec, and from 1076 was teacher of
          scholastic theology at Paris, where he gathered around him a
          number of prominent pupils. With the most notable of them, the
          genial [391]William of Champeaux, he laid the foundation of the
          later University of Paris. Toward the end of the century he
          became archdeacon and cathedral scholasticus in his native city.
          His reputation as the foremost Biblical exegete made the school
          renowned and induced young Abelard to attend his lectures. His
          influence on posterity was mainly due to his Glossa
          interlinearis, a paraphrastic commentary on the Vulgate, which
          far surpassed the popular Glossa ordinaria of Walafrid Strabo,
          but was not able to displace entirely this older work. He also
          wrote exegetical notes on the Song of Songs, Matthew, and
          Revelation.

   Anselm of Lucca
          ANSELM OF LUCCA: 1. Anselm Badagius (Badagio): Bishop of Lucca
          1057-73, also pope (Alexander II.) 1061-73. See [392]Alexander
          II., pope.

          2. Bishop of Lucca 1073-86; d. at Mantua Mar. 18, 1086. He was
          nephew and successor of the preceding, and bore the same family
          name. In 1073 he is designated electus Lucensis by Gregory VII.,
          whom he consulted as to whether he should receive investiture
          from the king. The pope decided that it should be postponed
          until Henry IV. had cleared himself of association with his
          excommunicated counselors and had made his peace with Rome.
          Henry especially requested that Anselm's consecration should not
          take place until after his investiture; and in fact he received
          the ring and staff from the king's hand before he was
          consecrated, Apr. 28, 1075. Soon after, troubled in conscience
          by this relation, he wished to resign his see and retired to a
          monastery, but was recalled by Gregory, whom he afterward
          supported with a more ardent loyalty than any other Italian
          bishop. His personality counted for much when Guibert of Ravenna
          had been set up as an antipope, and the struggle of Gregory with
          Henry IV. and the Lombard bishops reached its height. With
          Countess Matilda, Anselm was the principal upholder of the papal
          cause in the north of Italy. He was driven from his diocese, but
          was entrusted with a vicariate covering the whole of Lombardy.
          When Gregory felt death approaching, he commended Anselm to Otto
          of Ostia and Hugh of Lyons as his choice for successor; but
          Anselm died while still an exile. His most notable literary work
          was his Collectio canonum, which was incorporated almost bodily
          in the Decretum Gratiani. Other important writings of his were
          directed to the ending of the schism; the principal one
          preserved is the Liber contra Wibertum et sequaces ejus, written
          in 1085-86 after Gregory's death. Fragments of a commentary on
          the Psalms and some devotional treatises attributed to Anselm
          have also been preserved.

   Ansgar
          ANSGAR or ANSKAR (Aasgejr, Osgejr, "God's Spear"; the modern
          Oscar): The apostle of Scandinavia, first archbishop of Hamburg
          (831-865); b. of prominent Frankish parents near the monastery
          of Corbie (9 m. e. of Amiens), probably in 801; d. at Bremen
          Feb. 3, 865. After his mother's early death he was brought up at
          Corbie, and made rapid progress in the learning of the time. In
          822 he was one of a colony sent to found the abbey of Corvey
          (New Corbie) in Westphalia, and became there a teacher and
          preacher. When, four years later, Harold, king of Denmark, made
          an alliance with the Franks which included the acceptance of
          their religion, Ansgar was among those chosen to accompany the
          king to Denmark to evangelize the people. He and his companion
          Autbert founded a school at Harold's court after the Frankish
          model, but their work had to be abandoned on account of the
          downfall of Harold (827) and the illness and death of Autbert.
          In the autumn of 829, probably, Swedish ambassadors appeared at
          the imperial court and asked that Christian missionaries be sent
          to their country. Again Ansgar was selected, and with him,
          Witmar, his former colleague in the abbey-school at Corvey.
          After a perilous journey, they reached Sweden and were allowed
          to preach freely, with considerable success, at Björkö (Birka)
          on an island in Lake Mälar.

          Ansgar spent two years in Sweden, returning home in 831 to
          report to the emperor. The time was now ripe for the
          accomplishment of a plan of great importance for the northern
          missions, which Charlemagne had had in mind, and for which his
          son had now found the right man, viz., the establishment of a
          bishopric of Hamburg. Besides a diocese formed from those of
          Bremen and Verden, the new metropolitan was to have the right to
          send missions into all the northern lands and to consecrate
          bishops for them. Ansgar was consecrated in Nov., 831, and, the
          arrangements having been at once approved by Gregory IV., went
          to Rome to receive the pallium directly at the hands of the pope
          and to be named legate for the northern lands. This commission
          had previously been bestowed upon Ebo, archbishop of Reims; but
          an amicable agreement was reached by which the jurisdiction was
          divided, Ebo retaining Sweden for himself. For a time Ansgar
          devoted himself to the needs of his own diocese, which was still
          missionary territory with but a few churches. He founded in
          Hamburg a monastery and a school; the latter was to serve the
          Danish mission, but accomplished little.

          After the death of Louis le Débonnaire (840), Ansgar lost the
          abbey of Turholt, which had been given as an endowment for his
          work, and in 845 Hamburg was destroyed by the Danes, so that he
          was a bishop without either see or revenue. Many of his helpers
          deserted him, and his work was in danger of extinction. The new
          king, Louis the German, came to his aid; after failing to
          recover Turholt for him, he planned to bestow upon him the
          vacant diocese of Bremen. There were many canonical and other
          difficulties in the way; but after prolonged negotiations
          Nicholas I. approved the union of the two dioceses (864). From
          848 Ansgar resided in Bremen, and did what he could to revive
          the Danish mission. When he was established in a position of
          dignity once more, he succeeded in gaining permission from King
          Haarik to build a church in Sleswick, and secured the
          recognition of Christianity as a tolerated religion. He did not
          forget the Swedish mission, and spent two years there in person
          (848-850), at the critical moment when a pagan reaction was
          threatened, which he succeeded in averting. In his own diocese
          he showed himself a model bishop, forward in all works of
          charity, and of a prayerful and ascetic life. His humility was
          most marked; when people attempted to venerate him as a
          wonder-worker, he reproved them, saying that it would be the
          greatest of miracles if God should deign to make him a really
          devout man. He was canonized by Nicholas I. not long after his
          death. A collection of brief prayers from his hand is extant
          with the title Pigmenta (ed. J. M. Lappenberg, Hamburg, 1844).

          another.

   Anthony, Saint, Orders of
          ANTHONY, SAINT, ORDERS OF: The oldest and most important of the
          religious orders named after St. Anthony, the father of
          monasticism, is that of the Hospitalers of St. Anthony, founded
          about the time of the first crusade (1095-99) by a nobleman of
          St. Didier la Mothe in Dauphiné, Gaston by name. According to
          the traditions of the order, Gaston's son, Guérin, was cured of
          the disease known as St. Anthony's fire (morbus sacer),
          whereupon the father founded a hospital for those suffering from
          this and similar maladies, near the great church of St. Didier,
          and, with his son and eight knightly comrades, undertook the
          part of nurses in the institution. St. Anthony appeared to the
          founder, gave him his staff (shaped like the letter "T"), and
          encouraged him in the work. Urban II. is said to have confirmed
          the order at the synod at Clermont in 1095. Calixtus II. in 1118
          dedicated the church belonging to the Benedictine monastery Mons
          Major at St. Didier to St. Anthony, and so made it the chief
          sanctuary of the order, which was subject to the Benedictines.
          From the end of the twelfth century the order spread through the
          foundation of many houses (as at Rome in 1194; at Acco in 1208;
          and many in central and north Germany), and it acquired
          considerable wealth through the persistent zeal of its
          almsgatherers. They wore a black robe with a light blue "T" (St.
          Anthony's cross), and a little bell on the neck announced their
          coming. After a hard struggle the Hospitalers freed themselves
          from the Benedictines, and in 1286, by adopting the rule of St.
          Augustine, they became regular canons (popularly known as
          Tönniesherrn). In 1297 Boniface VIII. freed them from all
          episcopal jurisdiction and made their head master, the general
          abbot of St. Didier, directly subject to the papal see. At the
          beginning of the sixteenth century the number of houses amounted
          to 364. The order had suffered a moral deterioration, which the
          general abbot, Brunel de Gramont, with papal support, vainly
          endeavored to correct in the seventeenth century. In 1774 the
          order was united with the Knights of Malta (see [395]John,
          Saint, Order of Hospitalers of).

          fifteen years of age he joined the Augustinian canons at Lisbon.
          Afterward he went to Coimbra and by zealous study made himself
          master of the theology of his time. The translation of the bones
          of the first martyred Franciscans from Morocco to Coimbra
          awakened in Anthony a desire for martyrdom; to accomplish his
          purpose in 1220 he joined the Minorites and sailed to Africa;
          being confined to his bed by sickness throughout the winter, he
          resolved to return home. On the way he was driven to Messina and
          with the brethren there went to the chapter at Assisi in 1221,
          where he was taken to a hermitage in the Romagna. By accident
          his oratorical gifts became known when he was ordained priest at
          Forli; and he was made preacher of the order. Of his public
          activity, which now commenced, very little is known. For a time
          he acted as lector to the Minorites at Bologna, although Francis
          of Assisi, influenced by Elias of Cortona, who wished to
          introduce scientific study into the order, gave his permission
          very reluctantly. Anthony next went to France, and was guardian
          at Puy and custos in Limousin. As in the Romagna, he showed
          himself an indefatigable persecutor of heretics in the struggle
          with the Cathari. At Rimini he converted some of them by his
          persuasive powers, and he united the converts at Padua into a
          brotherhood of penitents. Finally he was made provincial, and in
          1229 went to Padua.

          In 1230 Anthony took part in the general chapter at Assisi, and
          he was released from his office as provincial in order that he
          might devote himself entirely to preaching. He, however, took a
          prominent part in the controversy of the parties which developed
          among the Minorites. He sided with Elias and was among the
          delegates sent to Rome to have the differences decided by the
          pope, who accordingly issued the bull Quo elongati, Sept. 28,
          1230 (see [396]Francis, Saint, of Assisi, and the Franciscan
          Order).

          Anthony's fame rests solely upon his ability as a preacher,
          which produced a great impression, especially in the district of
          Treviso. The Latin sketches of his sermons convey little
          impression of his manner, but they show him to have been a
          strict preacher of repentance and of contempt of the world, who
          urged indefatigably the use of the means of grace provided by
          the Church. It is said that 30,000 auditors listened to him in
          an open field at Padua. His restless activity wore him out, and,
          suffering from dropsy, he vainly sought relief by retiring to
          solitude, taking up his abode in a tree. He was canonized for
          political reasons by Gregory IX., May 30, 1232. [There is a
          curious story that on one occasion, disgusted with the
          indifference of his audience, Anthony betook himself to the
          seashore and addressed his discourse to the fishes, which came
          in shoals to listen. Joseph Addison, Remarks on Italy, at the
          end of "Brescia, Verona and Padua," gives the Italian text and
          an English translation.]

          ANTHROPOLOGY. See [397]Theology.

   Anthropomorphism
          ANTHROPOMORPHISM and ANTHROPOPATHISM (Gk. anthrOpos, "man," +
          morphe, "form," and pathos, "passion, suffering"): Terms
          designating views of God which represent him as possessed of a
          human form or members, human attributes, or human passions. Such
          views arise from the natural tendency or necessity of man to
          conceive of higher beings by analogy with himself, and are
          incidental to all religions at a certain stage of their
          development. Many passages of the Bible easily lend themselves
          to an anthropomorphic interpretation. The [398]Audians of the
          fourth and fifth centuries taught that all references to God's
          hands, ears, eyes, etc., are to be interpreted literally. Some
          philosophers believe the conception of God as a personal spirit
          to be anthropomorphic. Scholars who accept the compilatory
          theory of the origin of the Pentateuch consider anthropomorphism
          a marked characteristic of the Elohist, usually cited as E.
          Others maintain that the Scriptures, rightly interpreted, lend
          no support to such views. See [399]Comparative Religion, VI., 1,
          a, § 3.

          Anthropomorphism is inseparable from any conception of
          supernatural powers or God. This fact has received two
          interpretations. (1) Religion never outgrows the essential
          characteristics of its origin, whether this is conceived of as
          mythological (Comte), animistic (Tylor), or through dreams
          (Spencer). In the lower stages of religion, the gods are only
          larger men. According to Feuerbach, following Xenophanes and
          Lucretius (De rerum natura, v. 121), man creates God in his own
          image (cf. Feuerbach, Wesen des Christenthums, chap. 1, § 2). In
          the progress from polytheism to monotheism, the human qualities
          are indefinitely enlarged, concentrated, and united in one
          being, but the being is still human. Between the mode of human
          intelligence and omniscience, the human will and omnipotence,
          between human goodness and divine perfection, between
          personality and the Infinite is not only an immeasurable but an
          irreconcilable difference. The result for thought is either that
          there is no God (Comte), or, if such a being exists, we are
          compelled to distrust all anthropomorphic notions and take
          refuge in the Unknown and the Unknowable (Spencer, First
          Principles, New York, 1892, pp. 108-123). The latter alternative
          leaves room for the religious sentiments, but only in the form
          of awe. To rid the idea of God of every trace of
          anthropomorphism, however, simply abolishes the idea itself. (2)
          According to the second view--which is met with under many
          variations--religious ideas are not only incurably
          anthropomorphic, but they share this property with all other
          ideas. They contain objective truth, even if this is lacking in
          scientific accuracy of expression. Either rational and moral
          qualities are to be ascribed to God, on the ground that these
          are essential to the perfection of personality (S. Harris, The
          Self-Revelation of God, New York, 1887, pp. 433-440), or, since
          they are derived from the human consciousness and the region of
          the finite, they may be interpreted only analogically and
          symbolically; e.g., force, cause, energy, the eternal, the
          infinite, the power not ourselves that makes for righteousness,
          even personality and fatherhood have a real meaning for
          religious feeling and thought, although their full significance
          transcends both definition and comprehension. The Scriptures,
          which are marked by definite stages of anthropomorphic
          representations of God, contain a corrective for an undue
          reliance on this mode of conception.

          Old Testament Conceptions (§ 2).

          Later Hellenistic Jewish Literature (§ 3).

          In the New Testament (§ 4).

          In Post-Christian Judaism and in the Church (§ 5).

  1. The Idea Possibly of Babylonian Origin.

          The name "Antichrist" is first found in the Epistles of John (I.
          ii. 18, 22, iv. 3; II. 7). The idea, however, is in earlier New
          Testament writings, and its roots are in the Old Testament.
          According to a modern supposition they are even to be sought in
          the Babylonian chaos-myth,--a native myth of the springtime,
          which narrates how Tiamat, the ruler over the deeps of darkness
          and the waters, aided by her powers, rebelled against the upper
          gods, but was overcome by Marduk, the son of the gods, who had
          been elevated to the throne and then created the heavenly
          lights. It has been supposed that the Old Testament writings
          indicate that this myth migrated to Canaan in very ancient
          times, was transferred by the Israelites to the latter end of
          the world, and was applied in various forms also to political
          enemies of the people; and herein is sought the origin of the
          Old Testament idea of a rise and conquest of evil powers, which
          preceded the establishment of the kingdom of God (Gunkel,
          Schöpfung und Chaos, Göttingen, 1895, pp. 221 sqq.). But
          influence of old Oriental thoughts upon the figurative style of
          Biblical writings can be admitted only in a very limited degree.

  2. Old Testament Conceptions.

          Neither the sources of the eschatological ideas which meet in
          the notion of Antichrist, nor the characteristic features of
          their development can be traced back to extra-Biblical elements.
          The belief in the election of Israel as a people of God,
          sanctified unto him and blessed by him, received a rude shock by
          the experience of a reality apparently opposed to such choice.
          Hence arose the prophecy, that, because of its faithlessness
          Israel is given over to heathen powers, but that it shall be
          delivered from them, their presumption being punished for
          exceeding their divine commission as God's scourges. Thus the
          opinion was formed that before the kingdom of God is completed
          it is to be attacked by the godless world. As the representative
          of the latter, Ezekiel (xxxviii. 2, xxxix. 1-6) mentions Magog,
          the land of King Gog, a comprehensive designation of the nations
          of the north. Zechariah (xii.-xiv.) describes more minutely the
          oppression of the people of God by hostile powers. When
          Antiochus IV. Epiphanes of Syria undertook with cruel severity
          to supplant the religion of Israel by Greek heathenism, these
          ideas found a further development. The heathen world-power then
          appeared not as an instrument of punishment in the hand of God,
          but as his adversary, attacking with destructive purpose the
          very center of his kingdom. The history of the godless
          world-kingdom, which reaches its climax in the person of the
          proud king, is thus represented in the Book of Daniel.

  3. Later Hellenistic Jewish Literature.

          Gradually the last enemy of the kingdom of God came to be
          thought of as the antitype of the Messiah; at least such is the
          representation of the later Hellenistic Jewish literature (cf.
          Num. xxiv. 7, LXX.; Sibyllines, iii. 652 sqq.). In the extant
          pre-Christian Palestinian literature no indication is found of a
          personal antitype of the Messiah. In the older portions of the
          Book of Enoch the appearance of the Messiah is spoken of as
          taking place at the end of all struggles and judgments (Enoch
          xc. 37). In the pseudo-Solomonic Psalms (xvii. 27-39) of the
          time of Pompey, and in the Fourth Book of Ezra, of the time of
          the Flavian emperors, it is the godless powers or the heathen
          nations who are overpowered by the Messiah. In the almost
          contemporary Apocalypse of Baruch (xl. 1-2) this passage is
          applied to the destruction of a last impious king by the
          Messiah. The conception here is not yet influenced by
          Christianity; and thus the expectation of a personal opponent to
          the Messiah is found in pre-Christian Judaism.

  4. In the New Testament.

          In the New Testament writings the thought seems to be influenced
          by ideas which originated in the Christian revelation. The great
          struggle against sin as selfishness revived the idea of a final
          culmination of the enmity against God. On the other hand, by the
          separation of the religious life from the national-political
          life, the idea is divested of its natural form and is more
          spiritualized. In his eschatological discourse where the
          abomination of desolation in the holy place is spoken of as
          expressive of the tribulation of the approaching end (Matt.
          xxiv. 15), Jesus quoted the Book of Daniel. But the Messianic
          son of man is here not opposed, as in Daniel, by a ruler who at
          the same time destroys the religious and national side of the
          theocracy, but by a great number of pseudo-prophets and
          pseudo-Messiahs (Matt. xxiv. 5), who are thought of as fanatical
          representatives of a Jewish natural Messianic idea. The apostle
          Paul, when he declares that the appearance of the man of sin,
          the opponent who rises against every thing which contains good
          and God's service, will precede the coming of Christ (II Thess.
          ii. 3-4), no doubt also thought in the first place of a
          pseudo-Messiah in personal recollection of the bitter opposition
          to the Gospel by Judaism filled with politico-Messianic thoughts
          (I Thess. ii. 15). For his picture of the adversary he doubtless
          took some traits from the description of Antiochus Epiphanes in
          the Book of Daniel and that of Caligula in history, who had his
          image in the form of Jupiter set up in the Temple at Jerusalem.
          Furthermore, Paul's high conception of the superhuman virtue of
          Christ, is reflected in the description of his antitype. In
          John's Apocalypse the counterpart of the kingdom of God in the
          last times, besides the nations Gog and Magog, which are to
          march against the holy city after the completion of the
          millennium (Rev. xx. 8), includes also the Roman power,
          personified (xvii. 11) in the incendiary, matricide, and
          persecutor of the Christians on the imperial throne, Nero (xvii.
          9 sqq.), as well as a multitude of false prophets who mislead to
          the cult of the world-kingdom and its rule (xiii. 11-17, xvi.
          13, xix. 20, xx. 10), representing no doubt the heathenish Roman
          practises of augury and necromancy. The last development of the
          idea within the New Testament is found in the Epistles of John,
          where the thought is of an opponent to the true Christ, putting
          himself in his place, brought about by doctrinal necessities to
          characterize heretics who destroy the unity of the historical
          Jesus and the bearer of the revelation of God, Christ. In these
          persons, according to the clear statement of the epistles (I
          John ii. 22; II John 7), the idea and the character of the
          Antichrist are realized.

  5. In Post-Christian Judaism and in the Church.

          In post-Christian Judaism the early national conception was
          enhanced. The name "Antichrist," borrowed from Christianity,
          does not become current until late (e.g., in Abrabanel). But in
          the first Christian centuries there is found in Jewish
          literature the notion of a perpetrator of outrages upon the
          Jewish people in the last days. Sporadically, the figure of a
          powerful woman after the manner of Cleopatra appears
          (Sibyllines, iii. 77, v. 18, viii. 200); oftener that of an
          imperial Roman anti-Messiah. In later times Antichrist was
          represented in Jewish theology as victor over the suffering
          Messiah, and was called Romulus, also Armillus. In the Christian
          Church of the first centuries the main types of the Biblical
          Antichrist reappear. Origen identified the notion in an abstract
          sense with that of false doctrine. Certain contemporaneous
          representatives of heretical teaching were called by the name,
          without thereby excluding the expectation of an Antichrist as a
          future individual (cf. Didache, xvi.). Very often the latter was
          thought of as a false Jewish Messiah--hence circumcised and
          compelling circumcision--and it was expected that he would come
          from the tribe of Dan and from the East. The connection of
          Antichrist with Nero in the Apocalypse of John was also
          developed by representing him as the resuscitated Nero
          (Lactantius, De mortibus persecutorum, ii.; Jerome, on Dan, xi.
          17; Augustine, De civitate Dei, xx. 13). Both conceptions were
          strangely fused (Victorinus, Comment. ad Apoc.) or outwardly
          connected with each other into the notion of a double
          Antichrist, a Western (Roman) and an Eastern, appearing in
          Jerusalem. In relation to Satan, the Antichrist was thought of
          as a man working his will, as his son, and even as his
          incarnation.

          The idea receded in the Middle Ages, and when it again appeared
          it was mostly applied to phenomena of the present. It has often
          been applied to the papacy, an interpretation which was adopted
          by Luther (Adversus execrabilem Antichristi bullam) and other
          Reformers, and taken into the symbolical books of the Lutheran
          Church (Art. Schmal., ii. 4; Tract. de pot. Papæ). On the other
          hand, Roman Catholics have referred the Antichrist to Luther and
          Protestantism.

          F. Sieffert.

          As Bousset (Antichrist) has so convincingly shown, a tradition
          was evidently current in Jewish thought which underlay the
          teaching both of Paul and the Apocalypse concerning the
          Antichrist. The tradition appears to have contained the
          following features. The coming of Antichrist was prevented by
          the Roman power. When this power should fall, the Antichrist,
          not of foreign birth but a Jewish false Messiah, would establish
          himself in the temple at Jerusalem and require men to worship
          him. His reign would last for three and one-half years. By means
          of his miraculous power he would convert the world to his side.
          Later, his real character would be exposed; the believing Jews
          having fled into the wilderness would be pursued by him, and
          then he would be slain by the true Messiah with the breath of
          his mouth. This tradition is in part followed and in part
          contradicted by the Apocalypse and by Paul. In its background is
          the Book of Daniel with its fierce foreign oppressor; the
          Apocalyptic Belial, a supernatural spirit who will antagonize
          God at the end of time (Sybillines, bk. iii.); the doctrine of
          Satan (Rev. xx. 2); the Babylonian dragon-myth (Gunkel,
          Schöpfung und Chaos); and a man filled with satanic might. The
          doctrine of Antichrist contains one of the solutions which the
          early Church had to offer for two problems of the religious
          consciousness--the origin and overthrow of evil, and theodicy.

   Antidicomarianites
          ANTIDICOMARIANITES, an´´ti-dic´´o-mê´ri-?n-?its: A name applied
          by Epiphanius (Hær., lxxviii.) to opponents of the belief in the
          perpetual virginity of Mary, the mother of Christ. The New
          Testament speaks of the "brethren" of Jesus; and in Tertullian's
          time the opinion was still prevalent that Mary's marriage with
          Joseph was a true marriage. Thus he writes (De monogamia,
          viii.): "Truly it was a virgin who bore Christ, but after doing
          so she married, in order that the last title of sanctity might
          be checked off in the inventory of Christ; a mother who was both
          a virgin and a once married woman." But by the fourth century it
          was considered as established that there had not been a real
          marriage. The older belief had not, however, altogether
          disappeared. Epiphanius found the opinion current in Arabia that
          Mary, after the birth of Christ, had lived with Joseph as his
          wife and had children by him. He classed the adherents of this
          view as a sect, bestowed upon them a name of his own
          composition, meaning "opponents of Mary," and controverted their
          belief in a lengthy treatise, which he gives in the passage
          cited above.

   Antimensium
          ANTIMENSIUM, an´´ti-men´si-um: A name applied in the Greek
          Church to a linen cloth spread upon the altar before the
          beginning of the eucharistic service, and considered as making
          it an altar ready for the sacrifice. Since the Greek Church,
          like the Roman Catholic, holds that the eucharistic sacrifice
          may be offered only on a consecrated altar, and since this
          consecration can be performed only by the bishop (taking place
          usually at the time of the consecration of the church), the mass
          could not be celebrated in churches not yet consecrated, if the
          use of this consecrated cloth--in the Roman Catholic Church, of
          a portable altar-stone (see [401]Altar)--were not held to supply
          the deficiency.

          2. The Antinomian Controversy in New England.

I. Antinomianism in General:

  1. New Testament Antinomianism.

          The name antinomianism is a comparatively modern designation of
          several types of ethical thought in which hostility to the
          Mosaic law (including the decalogue) and to the principles
          therein embodied has led to immoral teaching and practise.
          Traces of such thought are evident in the New Testament. The
          spiritualization of the law into the one precept of love to God
          taught and exemplified by Jesus encouraged some overenthusiastic
          devotees to believe that they had been exalted to such a height
          of spirituality and such an overmastering love to God that they
          needed to have no regard to moral precepts or to outward
          conduct; while Paul's insistence on the goodness, holiness, and
          spirituality of the law did not suffice to convince all of those
          who considered themselves his disciples that, as being utterly
          ineffectual for human salvation and as occasioning and inciting
          to sin, it was not itself sin and worthy to be treated with
          abhorrence. Paul's sharp conflict with Judaizers in regard to
          the observance of Jewish ceremonies could hardly fail to
          convince his more radical anti-Judaistic followers that the
          effort to keep the law perfectly was not only vain but involved
          the setting at naught of the gospel of free grace in Christ
          Jesus. Some such perversion of Paul's teaching was probably in
          the mind of the writer of II Pet. iii. 16. The members of the
          Corinthian Church who were puffed up and did not mourn over the
          incestuous person, as well as the parties guilty of the
          abominable union (I Cor. v. 1-6), were probably antinomian, and
          of like tendency were doubtless the Nicolaitans (Rev. ii. 2, 15;
          see [402]Nicolaitans), those that held the teaching of Balaam
          (Rev. ii. 14), and those that suffered the woman Jezebel (Rev.
          ii. 20).

  2. Gnostic Antinomianism.

          Many Gnostics objected to the Mosaic law as being too formal and
          not sufficiently spiritual, on the one hand, and as giving too
          much place to carnal indulgence, on the other (see
          [403]Gnosticism). Holding the flesh in contempt as an evil
          product of the demiurge, some thought it their duty to practise
          a rigorous asceticism, while others are represented by their
          Christian assailants as thinking it right to destroy the body by
          vicious practises. The [404]Cainites regarded with approval
          Cain, Esau, Korah, the Sodomites, and all other characters
          reprobated in the Old Testament, and presumably supposed that
          they were doing God service in themselves defying the authority
          of Jehovah (the demiurge) and doing the things forbidden in the
          law. [405]Carpocrates and Epiphanes appear to have disseminated
          antinomian teachings. The followers of [406]Marcion and the
          [407]Manicheans were antinomian in the sense that they rejected
          the Mosaic law because of its permission of marriage and even
          polygamy and concubinage, of capital punishment, etc.; but did
          not, so far as appears, make repudiation of the law an excuse
          for fleshly indulgence. The followers of [408]Priscillian, a
          strong ascetic party in Spain with Gnostic tendencies (fourth
          and fifth centuries), were tortured into confessing the most
          immoral practises; but there is no good reason for crediting the
          calumnies of their persecutors. The [409]Messalians, a mystical
          sect that flourished in Syria, Mesopotamia, and Armenia from the
          fourth century onward, are said to have practised a squalid kind
          of asceticism, mendicancy, promiscuous sleeping together of men
          and women, and prayer to the devil. On account of the last named
          practise they were sometimes called Satanites. It seems probable
          that they were antinomian. Of like character, or worse, were the
          Adamites referred to by Epiphanius, and the same may be said of
          medieval parties known by this name (see [410]Adamites).

  3. Antinomianism of the Middle Ages.

          The Bogomiles and kindred sects (see [411]New Manicheans) are
          accused by their enemies of the most immoral practises. Amalric
          of Bena (d. 1204) carried pantheistic ideas so far as to
          maintain that "to those constituted in love no sin is imputed"
          (see [412]Amalric of Bena). His followers are said to have
          maintained that harlotry and other carnal vices are not sinful
          for the spiritual man, because the spirit in him, which is God,
          is not affected by the flesh and can not sin, and because the
          man, who is nothing, can not sin so long as the spirit, which is
          God, is in him. Such teachings were carried to the most immoral
          consequences by the [413]Brethren of the Free Spirit and the
          [414]Beghards, if the inquisitorial records of the fifteenth
          century can be believed. Johann Hartmann in the diocese of Mainz
          claimed that by contemplation he had become so completely one
          with God and God so completely one with him that an angel could
          not tell the difference; that a man free in spirit is rendered
          impeccable and can do whatever he will and whatever pleases him.
          He carried these doctrines to the most extreme and revolting
          consequences (cf. the documents in Döllinger, Beiträge zur
          Sektengeschichte des Mittelalters, ii., Munich, 1890, pp. 384
          sqq.). This type of antinomianism seems to have been widespread
          during the later Middle Ages and was perpetuated in some of the
          parties of the Reformation time.

  4. Of the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries.

          The pantheistic sect of the "Libertines," who appeared in the
          Netherlands about 1525 and thence spread into France and were
          combated by Calvin (see [415]Libertines, 3; [416]Loists) were
          Antinomians. They disregarded the Mosaic law and law in general
          as inapplicable to the spiritual man and felt free to lie,
          steal, and indulge the passions. [417]David Joris, the mystic,
          was accused by his opponents of antinomian teachings, but
          apparently without sufficient reason. It would be easy to point
          out antinomian tendencies in a number of continental parties of
          the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries not commonly reckoned
          among Antinomians. The hyper-Calvinistic (supralapsarian)
          teaching of men like Piscator (d. 1625) and Gomar (d. 1641) in
          the Netherlands, as that "sins take place, God procuring and
          himself willing that they take place, nay, absolutely so
          willing" and that in giving the law and commanding its
          observance He made its observance absolutely impossible, really
          struck at the root of human responsibility and discouraged any
          effort to control the natural impulses. So, too, the Jesuit
          casuists of the more reckless type in substituting for the
          Mosaic law the Canon Law and in making the violation of the
          latter easy by their doctrines of "philosophical sin,"
          "direction of attention," "mental reservation," and
          "probabilism," etc., were constructively antinomian. Mystics of
          the later time, so far as they pantheistically identified
          themselves with God and supposed that by virtue of such
          spiritual exaltation they were subject to no ordinances human or
          divine, were antinomian in the sense in which the Brethren of
          the Free Spirit were.

  5. In England.

          Of special importance in this connection, because of the
          wide-spread influence exerted by his teachings on English and
          American thought and life, is Hendrik Niklaes, founder of the
          [418]Familists. In 1577 several of his works were published in
          English and called forth a considerable body of polemical
          literature. At this time there are said to have been one
          thousand Familists in England, and they were making an active
          and successful propaganda. To counteract their influence the
          privy council issued a form of abjuration to be applied to
          members of the party arraigned for heresy. Their principles were
          too nearly identical with those of the Brethren of the Free
          Spirit not to be subversive of morality as well as of Scriptural
          authority and historical Christianity, and their errors were all
          the more insidious because of the fact that they allowed
          themselves to conform outwardly to any required ecclesiastical
          or civil usages, and by the use of ambiguous language to profess
          the acceptance of any doctrine.

          During the Civil War and Commonwealth times almost every
          imaginable type of religious propagandism went forward with
          astonishing zeal and success. Familism (with other important
          influences) produced a relatively pure and evangelical mysticism
          in the Society of Friends and a grosser form of antinomianism in
          the Ranters (see below). The first, as far as known, to
          propagate distinctively antinomian principles in England at this
          time was John Eaton, who wrote The Honeycomb of Free
          Justification by Christ Alone (London, 1642). He distinguished
          the time of the law, the time of John the Baptist, and the
          Christian dispensation, as glorious, more glorious, and most
          glorious. Under the Mosaic law "sin was severely taken hold of,
          and punished sharply in God's children. . . . John laid open
          their sins, and the danger of them, yet we read not of any
          punishment inflicted on God's children. . . . The third time,
          the most glorious, is since Christ groaned out his blood and
          life upon the cross, by which sin itself, and guilt, and
          punishment are so utterly and infinitely abolished that there is
          no sin in the Church of God, and that now God sees no sin in us;
          and whosoever believeth not this point is undoubtedly damned"
          (quoted by E. Pagitt, Heresiography, London, 1662, p. 122). The
          following summary of teachings of seventeenth-century
          Antinomians from Thomas Gataker's Antinomianism Discovered and
          Confuted (London, 1652; quoted by Pagitt, p. 123) may be
          accepted as substantially trustworthy:

          1. That the Moral Law is of no use at all to a believer, nor a
          rule for him to walk in, nor to examine his life by, and that
          Christians are free from the mandatory power of it: whence one
          of them [Antinomians] cried out in the pulpit, "Away with the
          Law, which cuts off a mans legs and then bids him walk." 2. That
          it is as possible for Christ to sin as for a child of God to
          sin. 3. That the child of God need not nor ought not to ask
          pardon for sin, and that it is no less than blasphemy for him so
          to do. 4. That God doth not chasten any of his children for sin,
          nor is it for the sins of God's people that the land is
          punished. 5. That if a man know himself to be in a state of
          grace, though he be drunk, or commit murder, God sees no sin in
          him. 6. That when Abraham denied his wife, and in outward
          appearance seemed to lie in his distrust, lying, dissembling,
          and equivocating that his wife was his sister, yea, then all his
          thoughts, words, and deeds were perfectly holy and righteous
          from all spot of sin in the eyes of God.

  6. The Ranters.

          By far the most unattractive of the sectaries of this time are
          the Ranters, who seem to have been almost identical in doctrine
          and practise with the Brethren of the Free Spirit and who, by
          their enthusiastic propagandism, seduced multitudes from the
          fellowship of the evangelical denominations. According to Samuel
          Fisher (Baby Baptism Mere Babism, London, 1653), "Some Ranters
          are not ashamed to say that they are Christ and God, and there
          is no other God than they, and what's in them, and such like
          blasphemies." They denied the existence of the devil, heaven,
          and hell. Moses they declared to be a conjurer and Christ a
          deceiver of the people. Prayer is useless. Preaching and lying
          are all one. The Scriptures they regarded as cast-off fables,
          and when they condescended to use them at all they practised the
          most absurd allegorizing. They claimed that nothing is sin but
          what a man thinks to be so. Their practise is represented as
          corresponding with their immoral teaching.

  7. Later Phases of Antinomianism.

          A large proportion of the Particular Baptists of England during
          the latter half of the eighteenth century, by way of reaction
          against Socinianism and the missionary movement, became involved
          in a hyper-Calvinistic (supralapsarian) type of thought that
          involved making God responsible for evil, complete denial of
          human initiative or part in salvation and conduct, renunciation
          of the law as a rule of life, and the disowning of human agency
          and responsibility in the extension of the kingdom of Christ.
          This Baptist antinomianism was combated in England by Andrew
          Fuller, John Ryland, and others. A still more virulent type of
          antinomianism appeared among American Baptists in the nineteenth
          century by way of reaction against the missionary and
          educational work of the denomination. Here as in England leaders
          and led were illiterate and deeply prejudiced against human
          institutions and agencies, which they regarded as an impertinent
          interference with God's sovereignty. These antinomian Baptist
          parties are still extant. See [419]Baptists, I., 4, §§ 4-5;
          [420]II., 3, §§ 3, 4.

          A. H. Newman.

II. Antinomian Controversies:

1. Of the German Reformation:

  1. Luther's Earlier Teachings about the Law.

          Antinomian doctrines were vigorously discussed in Germany during
          the Reformation period until the Formula of Concord made a final
          adjustment of the matter in 1577. Luther had held that the
          Mosaic law, as an ancient code devised under special conditions
          for a particular people, was superseded by the civil law of
          modern states, and no longer possessed for Christians a
          juridical or ceremonial force. [3] Furthermore, the whole law,
          even the decalogue included, was in no wise to be employed by
          Christians in the spirit of justification by works, since that
          involved a superficial and mercenary idea of divine justice.
          There was, however, need to preach the law from a spiritual
          standpoint, emphasizing a realization of sin by which the
          conscience should be humbled before the divine wrath; though the
          preaching of the law exclusively led to either hypocrisy or
          despair. In his emphasis on justification by faith, Luther
          asserted that true repentance proceeded from a realizing sense
          of the work of Christ. The preaching of faith was to take
          precedence of all else, since, faith having been attained,
          contrition and consolation spontaneously followed. Nevertheless,
          more frequently and in entire consistency with the formal
          definition of his position in 1520, the process of salvation was
          described by him as beginning with the operation of the law upon
          the soul, which in repentance casts about for aid and is met
          with the promise of remission of sins through Christ.

  2. Agricola's Controversy with Melanchthon, 1527.

          The antinomian controversy was preluded by the complaints
          preferred in Bohemia in 1524 against one Dominicus Beyer, who
          strictly adhered to Luther's doctrine, but was accused by some
          of reversion to the Roman view in preaching, as it was said, the
          approach to faith through works of merit. Luther, Melanchthon,
          and Bugenhagen completely exonerated Beyer and clearly
          enunciated the Wittenberg position. Later Melanchthon's Articuli
          de quibus egerunt per visitatores (1527; CR, xxvi. 7 sqq.)
          placed the preaching of the law at the portal of Christian
          instruction, asserting that it led to repentance, which was the
          antecedent of faith, and without which the preaching of the
          gospel was unintelligible. Johann Agricola, who had eagerly
          emphasized Luther's earlier statements of repentance as a
          consequence of the gospel of divine grace, chose to regard
          Melanchthon's declaration as a personal affront. After
          addressing to Luther several memorials on the subject, he made
          specific complaints and circulated in manuscript a censure of
          Melanchthon's teaching. In a conference at Torgau (Nov. 26-28,
          1527) an adjustment was finally effected by Luther, who
          distinguished between faith in the general sense (fides
          generalis), as indeed antedating repentance, and the justifying
          faith which, impelled by conscience, apprehends divine grace.

  3. Agricola's Controversy with Luther, 1537 sqq.

          Agricola, though professing satisfaction, nevertheless continued
          in his antinomian position; repentance, consciousness of sin,
          and the fear of God were to be based upon the gospel and not
          upon the law. He began even to gather a party about himself as
          the Paul of the Reformation, who must set right Peter (Luther).
          Reports to this effect having gained currency, three published
          discourses of his were examined and found to contain antinomian
          views. In July, 1537, and again in September, Luther preached
          against such error, though without mention of Agricola,
          declaring in the latter instance that the gospel could no more
          be preached independently of the law than could the law
          independently of the gospel. At the close of October, Agricola
          came to an agreement with Luther whereby unanimity was
          recognized in the substance of doctrine. But now Agricola
          undertook to publish his Summarien über die Evangelien, the
          imprimatur of the rector being dispensed with on the ground that
          Luther had already seen and approved of the work. Luther
          thereupon forbade its completion, and determined upon an
          unsparing conflict. He published some antinomian theses of
          Agricola which had been privately circulated, and on Dec. 18
          held his first disputation against them. [4] Agricola did not
          put in an appearance, and Luther accordingly challenged him to a
          second disputation (Jan. 12, 1538), at which a solemn
          reconciliation took place. Agricola even authorized Luther to
          draw up a retraction in his name, which the latter did in
          damaging fashion in a letter to Caspar Güttel of Eisleben. The
          conflict seemed over, and in Feb., 1539, Agricola was appointed
          to the Wittenberg consistory. The dispute was, however, revived
          through reflections made against Luther by Agricola in a
          disputation at the University. Luther responded, and proceeded
          to vigorous attacks on the antinomians. He considered even the
          excommunication of Agricola. The latter, on his side, thought
          himself calumniated and collected material for his
          justification. In Mar., 1540, he submitted his complaints to the
          Elector. To these complaints Luther responded that what Agricola
          termed calumnies were but conclusions inevitably to be drawn
          from the latter's propositions. The Elector instituted formal
          proceedings against Agricola, who, though under pledge not to
          leave Wittenberg, withdrew in August to Berlin. From there he
          recalled his complaints and at Luther's demand prepared a letter
          of retraction. For a time he modified his views to some extent
          so that they approximated in a measure to those of Luther; but
          Luther's distrust was not removed, nor was Agricola really
          convinced of error.

  4. Jakob Schenk.

          After Agricola it was especially Jakob Schenk, court-preacher of
          Duke Henry and the Reformer of Freiberg, who came under
          suspicion of Antinomianism; he is said to have declared that
          "all who preached the law were possessed with the devil; . . .
          do what you will, if you only believe, you are saved," and "to
          the gallows with Moses!" An inquiry instituted against him
          (June, 1538) ended in his being called by the Elector to Weimar
          as court-preacher. In 1541 Duke Henry summoned him to Leipsic as
          preacher and university lecturer, but council, clergy, and
          theological faculty were all strongly opposed to him. Objection
          was made to the publication of his sermons, and they were found
          in several points to be at variance with the Augsburg
          Confession. In the indictment appears the old charge of
          antinomian doctrine, resting, indeed, on very slight
          foundations. In 1543 he finally left the duchy. The contents of
          his published writings furnish no adequate basis for calling him
          an Antinomian. But there is no doubt that his sermons erred
          repeatedly in that direction.

  5. Later Controversies.

          In connection with the Majoristic dispute over the necessity of
          good works, Luther's pupils, Andreas Poach of Erfurt and Anton
          Otho (Otto) of Nordhausen denied that the law had any
          significance whatever for believers, and thus arose the dispute
          de tertio usu legis. Otho directed his contention immediately
          against Melanchthon, though the latter had merely repeated
          Luther's statements. Against Otho and those of similar views
          arose several leaders, in particular Mörlin and Wigand. On the
          other hand, Melanchthon and his more immediate school was
          accused of antinomian doctrine in declaring the gospel to be the
          proclamation of repentance.

  6. Settlement of the Controversy.

          The Formula of Concord fixed the terminology of the whole matter
          by deciding that the law was a special revelation teaching what
          is just and pleasing in the sight of God, and refuting whatever
          is opposed to the divine will; while the gospel, on the other
          hand, taught what it was necessary to believe, especially the
          doctrine of forgiveness of sin through Christ. All that
          pertained to the punishment of sin belonged to the preaching of
          the law, though it was conceded that it might be said the gospel
          discoursed of repentance and the remission of sin, if gospel
          were understood to mean the sum of Christian doctrine. The
          preaching of the law became effective to a consciousness of sin
          only when the law was spiritually expounded by Christ.

          (G. Kawerau.)

2. The Antinomian Controversy in New England:

          The Puritans of New England, following in the footsteps of
          Calvin and Knox, were theocratic in their ideas of Christianity
          and were inclined to make the legalistic system of the Old
          Testament their model. The enforcement of rigorous regulations
          pertaining to every department of life (strict observance of
          Sunday as Sabbath, regular attendance at church, avoidance of
          every form of frivolity in dress or demeanor) provoked reaction
          here as it had done in Geneva. Mrs. Anne (Marbury) Hutchinson
          (b. in Lincolnshire 1590 or 1591; married about 1612 to William
          Hutchinson of Alford, Lincolnshire), who had been under the
          ministry of [421]John Cotton at Boston, Lincolnshire, had
          imbibed antinomian views, probably from Familists, and, on her
          arrival in New England (whither she followed her eldest son,
          Edward, arriving in Sept., 1634), while she continued to enjoy
          the ministrations of Cotton, now pastor of the Boston (Mass.)
          church, soon began to express in strong language her aversion to
          the preaching of a "covenant of works" in contradistinction to a
          "covenant of grace," by most of the Massachusetts preachers. She
          regarded Cotton as a preacher of a "covenant of grace," and he
          was no doubt considerably influenced by her views; when the
          agitation of the question seemed likely to wreck the colony, he
          found difficulty in convincing the dominant party of the
          soundness of his opinions. Rev. John Wheelwright, Mrs.
          Hutchinson's brother-in-law, a Cambridge graduate (arrived in
          New England May, 1636), accepted her views. Sir Henry Vane
          (arrived Oct., 1635; chosen governor May, 1636; see [422]Vane,
          Sir Henry) became a zealous advocate of the "covenant of grace."
          Mrs. Hutchinson expounded her views to large gatherings of
          women, who twice a week resorted to her house, and thus
          propagated them widely. She claimed that after a year of prayer
          it had been revealed to her that she had trusted in a covenant
          of works; under like divine impulse she had come to New England,
          there being no one in England that she durst hear. She was the
          daughter of an English clergyman and combined considerable
          theological information and argumentative effectiveness with a
          steadfastness and persistence worthy of a better cause. Like
          most religious reformers of the time she had wrought herself
          into the conviction that the few dogmas she held represented the
          whole truth and that all other teaching was diabolical and
          abominable. The chief opponents of Mrs. Hutchinson were
          [423]John Wilson, pastor of the Charlestown church, [424]Hugh
          Peters, pastor of the Salem church, and [425]John Winthrop. In
          Dec., 1636, the ministers censured Vane as responsible for the
          hurtful agitation, and sought to convince Mrs. Hutchinson of her
          errors. The Boston church of which Vane was a member undertook
          to censure Wilson, but could not secure the required unanimity,
          and Cotton was content publicly to admonish him. In Jan., 1637,
          Wheelwright, in a sermon, denounced the "covenant of works"
          people as "antichrists" and thus added fuel to the flames. In
          March the Court by a majority vote censured Wheelwright, and, in
          the gubernatorial election in May, Vane was defeated and
          Winthrop was elected. Coercive measures soon removed the
          disturbing element from Massachusetts. Vane returned to England.
          Wheelwright founded the town of Exeter in New Hampshire. The
          Hutchinsons went to Rhode Island (1638), and most of the party
          ultimately settled near Newport. After the death of her husband
          in 1642, Mrs. Hutchinson moved into Dutch territory in
          Westchester County, New York, and was murdered there by Indians
          in August or September, 1643.

          The character of this movement may best be set forth by quoting
          a contemporary summary of Mrs. Hutchinson's teachings:

          1. That the Law, and the preaching of it, is of no use at all to
          drive a man to Christ. 2. That a man is united to Christ and
          justified without faith, yea from eternity. 3. That faith is not
          a receiving of Christ, but a man's discerning that he hath
          received him already. 4. That a man is united to Christ only by
          the work of the Spirit upon him, without any act of his. 5. That
          a man is never effectually Christ's till he hath assurance. 6.
          This assurance is only from the witness of the Spirit. 7. This
          witness of the Spirit is merely immediate, without any respect
          of the Word, or any concurrence with it. 8. When a man hath once
          this witness, he never doubts more. 9. To question my assurance,
          though I fall into murder or adultery, proves that I never had
          true assurance. 10. Sanctification can be no evidence of a man's
          good estate. 11. No comfort can be had from any conditional
          promise. 12. Poverty in spirit . . . is only this, to see I have
          no grace at all. 13. To see I have no grace in me will give me
          comfort; but to take comfort from sight or grace is legal
          [legalistic]. 14. An hypocrite may have Adam's graces that he
          had in innocency. 15. The graces of saints and hypocrites differ
          not. 16. All graces are in Christ, as in the subject, and none
          in us, so that Christ believes, Christ loves, etc. 17. Christ is
          the new creature. 18. God loves a man never the better for any
          holiness in him, and never the less be he never so unholy. 19.
          Sin in a child of God must never trouble him. 20. Trouble in
          conscience for sins of commission, or for neglect of duty, shows
          a man to be under a covenant of works. 21. All covenants of God
          expressed in works are legal works. 22. A Christian is not bound
          to the Law as the rule of his conversation. 23. A Christian is
          not bound to pray, except the Spirit moves him. 24. A minister
          that hath not this (new) light is not able to edify others that
          have it. 25. The whole letter of the Scripture is a covenant of
          works. 26. No Christian must be pressed to duties of holiness.
          27 No Christian must be exhorted to faith, love, and prayer
          etc., except we know he hath the Spirit. 28. A man may have all
          graces and yet want Christ. 29. All a believer's activity is
          only to act sin. (Pagitt, ut sup., 124-126.) The following
          utterances ascribed to Mrs. Hutchinson and her followers are
          also significant: "In the saving conversion of a sinner the
          faculties of the soul and working thereof are destroyed and made
          to cease; and the Holy Ghost agitates instead of them. . . .
          That God the Father, Son, and Holy Ghost may give themselves to
          the soul, and that the soul may have true union with Christ,
          true remission of sins, . . . true sanctification from the blood
          of Christ, and yet be an hypocrite. . . . That the Spirit doth
          work in hypocrites by gifts and graces, but in God's children
          immediately. . . . That it is a soul-damning error to make
          sanctification an evidence of justification. . . . That the
          devil and nature may be the cause of good works."

   Antioch, Patriarchate of
          ANTIOCH, PATRIARCHATE OF. See [427]Patriarch; [428]Syria.

   Antioch, School of
          ANTIOCH, an´ti-oc, SCHOOL OF: A term designating, not an
          educational institution like the catechetical school of
          Alexandria, but a theological tendency deriving its influence
          from a number of prominent teachers. [The name is from Antioch
          on the Orontes, 16 m. from the Mediterranean, the famous city,
          the third in point of population in the Roman empire, and no
          mean rival of Rome in splendor. There were the groves of Daphne,
          where the sensual was pandered to in all ways. Yet there the
          first preachers of Christianity came, and it was there that the
          converts to the new faith were first called Christians.] A
          distinction must be made between an old and a new school--the
          former from about 270 to 360, the latter (to which the name is
          confined by some), after 360. The presbyter and martyr
          [429]Lucian (d. 311), who had great influence as an exegete and
          a metaphysician, and his contemporary the presbyter Dorotheus
          are generally mentioned as the founders of this school, but it
          may even go back as far as Paul of Samosata; at least, Lucian
          seems to have refused his assent to Paul's condemnation. Under
          altered circumstances, the cool intellectuality of the
          Antiochians, which shrank from the "mystery" of the incarnation,
          became Arianism. Arius himself, Eusebius of Nicomedia, and
          Asterius were disciples of Lucian; and the name of the last was
          frequently used by the Eusebian party to countenance their
          attempts at compromise. Most important, however, was Lucian's
          activity in Biblical criticism. In this field his influence was
          directly opposed to the dogmatico-allegorical expositions of the
          school of Origen, and it made for historical investigation.

          Of Lucian's scholars, Arius as a presbyter in Alexandria had
          performed for some time the function of expounding the
          Scriptures, and the clever "sophist" Asterius is said to have
          written commentaries on the Gospels, the Psalms, and the Epistle
          to the Romans, of which only an unimportant fragment remains.
          The semi-Arian bishop [430]Eusebius of Emesa is of more
          importance. Jerome attests the influence of his exegetical
          method on Diodorus, and calls Chrysostom "the follower of
          Eusebius of Emesa and Diodorus " (De vir. ill., cxix., cxxix.).
          [431]Eustathius of Antioch must be mentioned, not only for his
          dogmatic connection with the school (though a strict adherent of
          the Council of Nicæa, he met the Arian conclusion from the
          finite qualities of Christ against the fulness of his Godhead by
          a sharp distinction between the divine and human natures in him,
          between the eternal Son and his temple), but even more for his
          exegesis. His celebrated treatise on the witch of Endor (De
          Engastrimytho) is directly opposed to the method of Origen.
          [432]Diodorus of Tarsus (d. 378) may be considered the father of
          the school in the narrower sense. Chrysostom and Theodore of
          Mopsuestia were among his pupils, and the latter became the
          classical representative of the school. His theology is vigorous
          and original, a genuine offspring of the old Greek theology as
          seen in Origen, emphasizing strongly the freedom of the will as
          against the Augustinianism characteristic of Western thought.
          Both Diodorus and Theodore, in unison with the great doctors of
          their age as regards the Nicene faith, combated not only
          Arianism but Apollinarism. In exegesis Diodorus declares that he
          prefers the historical to the allegorical method; and Theodore
          strives with great energy for a true grammatico-historical
          exposition, and makes remarkable strides toward true Biblical
          criticism.

          Theodore's brother, Polychronius, first a monk in the cloister
          of St. Zebinas near Kyros, then bishop of Apamea (d. 430), was
          superior to Theodore as a Hebrew and Syriac scholar; his
          commentary on Daniel, of which considerable fragments were
          published by Mai in his Nova collectio, i., is distinguished by
          its study of the history of the period. The principles of the
          school of Antioch bore their fairest fruit in the thoughtful,
          practically edifying expositions of [433]John Chrysostom, though
          both he and another distinguished writer closely akin to him,
          [434]Isidore of Pelusium, make concessions to the allegorical
          method, or do not distinguish sharply between type and allegory.
          The latest writer who properly belongs to the school is the
          many-sided, clever, learned, but somewhat wavering Theodoret. In
          spite of his great dependence on and reverence for Theodore, he
          not only leaned in dogma to compromise, but in his exegesis he
          drifted away from Theodore's principles and bowed to
          ecclesiastical traditionalism, abandoning a large part of the
          exegetical conquests of the school.

          The polemical activity of the school is of no small importance.
          There were many of the old heretics still left in the region of
          its influence, as well as numerous Jews and pagans; and it
          fought the battles of the Church against them at a time when the
          other provinces were able to enjoy a large measure of peace.

   Antioch, Synod of
          ANTIOCH, SYNOD OF, 341 A.D.: Records of more than thirty synods
          held at Antioch in Syria in the early days of the Church are
          preserved. Of these the more important fall within the period of
          the controversy about the person of Christ, and are treated in
          connection with it. That of the year 341 requires separate
          treatment. It was held in connection with the consecration of
          the so-called Golden Basilica begun by Constantine and completed
          by Constantius. Athanasius says that ninety bishops were
          present; Hilary says ninety-seven. The synod passed twenty-five
          canons, and promulgated three creeds with a design to remove the
          Nicænum. The first canon confirmed the decision of the Nicene
          council on the celebration of Easter, and the second enforced
          participation in the complete liturgy. Most of the others dealt
          with questions of ecclesiastical organization, such as the
          relations of dioceses and the development of the metropolitan
          system. Priests were forbidden to wander from one diocese into
          another; schismatic assemblies were prohibited; persons
          excommunicated by one bishop were not to be reconciled by
          another; and strangers were not to be received without "letters
          of peace." The provincial system gained a firmer foothold by the
          reiteration of the fifth canon of Nicæa, requiring synods to be
          held twice a year. The position of the chorepiscopus suffered a
          corresponding depression in the eighth and tenth canons.
          Abstinence from interference with other dioceses and strict
          guardianship of church property are enjoined upon the bishops,
          who are also forbidden to name their successors. These canons
          formed an element of ecclesiastical law for both East and West,
          and were included in the Codex canonum used by the Council of
          Chalcedon.

          Fathers. An introductory epistle describes the martyrdom of

          ANTIPATER (an-tip´a-ter) OF BOSTRA: Bishop of Bostra (70 m. s.

          opponents of the Origenists, against whom he wrote his chief
          work (in Greek), the "Refutation." Only a few fragments of it
          are preserved, in the "Parallels" of John of Damascus. Most of
          the homilies ascribed to Antipater are not his. Even the two on
          John the Baptist and Annunciation Day, which Migne claims for
          him, are doubtful; the first supposes a fully developed
          veneration of the Baptist, and its diction is suggestive of
          Byzantine rhetoric; the other address is more simple. The
          question as to the genuineness of the homilies can not be
          decided until more of them shall have been published. His works

   Antiphon
          ANTIPHON, an´ti-fon: A term denoting primarily alternating song
          or chanting, one voice or choir answering another. It was a
          Jewish custom (Ezra iii. 11; I Chron. xxix. 20; Ps. cvi. 45;
          Matt. xxvi. 30) and was early introduced into the Christian
          Church. Basil (Epist., ccvii.), in writing to the clergy of
          Neocæsarea, mentions the two commonest methods: "Now, divided
          into two parts, they sing antiphonally with one another. . . .
          Afterward they again commit the prelude of the strain to one,
          and the rest take it up." The latter method could be either
          hypophonic, when the response consisted of the closing words of
          each verse or section; epiphonic, when an expression like
          "Amen," "Alleluia," "Gloria Patri" was repeated at the end of a
          psalm; or antiphonic in the strict sense, when the second body
          of singers responded to the first half of each verse with the
          second half, or the two bodies repeated verses alternately.
          Later the term "antiphon" came to mean merely a verse or formula
          with which the precentor, or precentors, began, and which was
          repeated by the entire choir at the end of the song. It
          determines the mode of the piece, and closes with the key-note
          followed by the dominant and the evovoe (the last notes of the
          piece; the name is made up of the vowels of seculorum, amen).
          The whole antiphon (abbreviated into ana) is now sung both at
          the beginning and at the end of psalms at lauds and vespers on
          double feast-days; at other times, only at the end. A collection
          of antiphons is called an antiphonarium or antiphonale.

          The Breviarium Romanum has many excellent antiphons, and the
          Evangelical Lutheran Church has also made use of them. They are
          chosen with reference to the content of the psalm or hymn to
          which they are joined, or they indicate its relation to special
          days and times. For example, an antiphon to Ps. lxiii. for
          Christmas is: "And the angel said unto them, fear not, for
          behold I bring you good tidings"; for Trinity Sunday, "Gloria
          tibi, Trinitas"; for apostles' days, "Ye are my friends." The
          music of the ancient antiphons is generally appropriate,
          beautiful, and powerful.

   Antipope
          ANTIPOPE: A papal usurper, not elected in the canonical way, but
          resting his claims on fraud or force. Political intrigues, the
          ambitions of sovereigns, and the action of a minority of the
          cardinals have generally been responsible for rival popes. In
          1046 there were four claimants of the papacy: Sylvester III.,
          Benedict IX., Gregory VI., and Clement II. It has not always
          been easy to decide which of the rivals was the true pope, and
          in such cases schism has been the result. The longest schism
          (known as "the Great Schism") succeeded the death of Gregory XI.
          (1378) and lasted fifty years (see [437]Schism). For the names

          Monarchianism and Other Forms to the Reformation (§ 2).

          Antitrinitarianism in Great Britain (§ 3).

          In New England (§ 4).

          Antitrinitarianism of the Present (§ 5).

          Antitrinitarianism is the general name for a number of very
          different views which agree only in rejecting the Christian
          doctrine of the Triune God. This doctrine did not originate in
          the extra-Christian world, but, with whatever adumbrations in
          the Old Testament revelation (cf. Dorner, System of Christian
          Doctrine, i., Edinburgh, 1880, pp. 345 sqq.), was first
          distinctly revealed in the missions of the Son and Spirit, and
          first clearly taught by Jesus (cf. W. Sanday, The Criticism of
          the Fourth Gospel, London, 1905, pp. 218 sqq.) and his apostles.
          It naturally, therefore, as a purely Christian doctrine, had to
          establish itself against both Jewish and heathen conceptions;
          and throughout its history it has met with more or less
          contradiction from the two opposite points of view of modalism
          (which tends to sink the persons in the unity of the Godhead)
          and subordinationism (which tends to degrade the second and
          third persons into creatures).

  1. The Earliest Antitrinitarianism.

          The earliest antitrinitarians were those Jews who in the first
          age of the Church were convinced, indeed, that Jesus was the
          promised Messiah, but, in their jealously guarded monotheism,
          could not admit him to be God, and taught therefore a purely
          humanitarian Christology. They bear the name in history of
          [440]Ebionites. The emanationism of the Gnostic sects, which
          swarmed throughout the second century, tended to
          subordinationism; and this tendency is inherent also in the
          Logos speculation by which the Christological thought of the
          Church teachers through the second and third centuries was
          dominated. The Logos speculation was not, however, consciously
          antitrinitarian; its purpose was, on the contrary, to construe
          the Church's immanent faith in the Trinity to thought, and to
          that end it suggested a descending series of gradations of deity
          by which the transcendent God (the Father) stretched out to the
          creation and government of the world (Son and Spirit). This
          subordinationism, however, bore bitter fruit in the early fourth
          century in the Arian degradation of the Son to a creature and of
          the Spirit to the creature of a creature.

  2. Monarchianism and Other Forms to the Reformation.

          The ripening of this fruit was retarded by the outbreak, as the
          second century melted into the third, of the first great
          consciously antitrinitarian movement in the bosom of the Church.
          This movement, which is known in history as [441]Monarchianism
          arose in Asia Minor and rapidly spread over the whole Church. In
          its earliest form as taught by the two Theodoti and Artemon, and
          in its highest development by Paul of Samosata, it conceived of
          Jesus as a mere man. In this form it was too alien to Christian
          feeling to make much headway; and it was quickly followed by
          another wave which went to the other extreme and made the
          Father, Son, and Spirit but three modes of being,
          manifestations, or actions of the one person which God was
          conceived to be. In this form it was taught first by Praxeas and
          Noetus and found its fullest expression in Sabellius, who has
          given his name to it. The lower form is commonly called
          Ebionitic or dynamistic Monarchianism; the higher, modalistic
          Monarchianism or, to use the nickname employed by Tertullian,
          Patripassianism. Modalistic Monarchianism came forward in the
          interests of the true deity of Christ, and, appearing to offer a
          clear and easy solution of the antinomy of the unity of God and
          the deity of the Son and Spirit, made its way with great
          rapidity, and early in the third century seemed to threaten to
          become the faith of the Church. It was partly in reaction from
          it that the Arians in the early fourth century pressed the
          subordinationism of much early church teaching to the extreme of
          removing the Son and Spirit out of the category of deity
          altogether, and thus created the greatest and most dangerous
          antitrinitarian movement the Church has ever known. The
          interaction of the modalistic and Arian factors brought it about
          that the statement of the doctrine of the Trinity wrought out in
          the ensuing controversies was guarded on both sides; and so well
          was the work done that the Church was little troubled by
          antitrinitarian opposition for a thousand years thereafter.
          During the Middle Ages the obscure dualistic and pantheistic
          sects, it is true, held to antitrinitarian doctrines of God; but
          within the Church itself defective conceptions of the Trinity,
          resting commonly on a pantheistic basis, manifested themselves
          rather in theological tendencies than in distinct parties (e.g.,
          Johannes Scotus Erigena; other tendencies in Roscelin and
          Abelard). In the great upheaval of the Reformation the
          antitrinitarianism of the obscure sects came into open view in
          the Anabaptist movement (Denk, Hätzer, Melchior Hofmann, David
          Joris, Johannes Campanus). At the head of the pantheistic
          antitrinitarianism of the Reformation era, however, stands
          Michael Servetus, and though his type of thought soon passed
          into the background, it was destined to be revived whenever
          mystical tendencies waxed strong (Boehme, Zinzendorf,
          Swedenborg). Meanwhile Laelius and Faustus Socinus succeeded in
          forming an organized sect of rationalistic antitrinitarians who
          found a refuge in Poland, established a famous university,
          issued symbolical documents (the chief of which is the Racovian
          Catechism, 1605), and created an influential literature
          (Schlichting, Volkel, the two Crells, Ostorodt, Schmalz,
          Wolzogen, Wiszowati).

  3. Antitrinitarianism in Great Britain.

          By the middle of the seventeenth century the Socinian
          establishment at Racow was broken up, but the influence of the
          type of thought it represented has continued until the present
          day. In Transylvania, indeed, the old Unitarian organization
          dating from the labors of Blandrata and David still exists.
          Elsewhere antitrinitarianism has crept in by way of more or less
          covert innovations representing themselves as "liberal," and
          running commonly through the stages of Arminianism and Arianism
          to Socinianism. In England, for example, a wide-spread hesitancy
          with regard to the doctrine of the Trinity was observable before
          the end of the seventeenth century, manifesting itself no less
          in the high subordinationism of writers like George Bull than in
          the frank Arianism of others like Samuel Clarke. It was not
          until 1774, however, that the first Unitarian chapel distinctly
          known as such was founded (Theophilus Lindsey), though this type
          of thought was rapidly permeating the community under the
          influence of men of genius like Joseph Priestly and men of
          learning like Nathaniel Lardner; and before the end of the
          second decade of the nineteenth century, a large body of the
          foremost Presbyterian congregations had become avowedly
          Unitarian. A somewhat similar history was wrought out in
          Ireland, where after a protracted controversy the Synod of
          Ulster was divided in 1827 on this question, W. Bruce leading
          the Unitarian party.

  4. In New England.

          By the middle of the eighteenth century, the prevalent attitude
          of suspicion with regard to the doctrine of the Trinity had
          communicated itself to the New England churches, and soon an
          antitrinitarian movement, developing out of the lingering
          Arminianism, was in full swing, which from 1815 received the
          name of Unitarianism. The consequent controversy reached its
          height in 1819, the date of the publication of W. E. Channing's
          sermon at the ordination of Jared Sparks at Baltimore, and was
          virtually over by 1833. The result was a body of definitely
          antitrinitarian churches bound together on this general basis,
          whose leaders have illustrated, on every possible philosophical
          foundation, every possible variety of antitrinitarianism from
          the highest modalism or Arianism down (and increasingly
          universally so as time has passed) to the lowest Socinianism.

  5. Antitrinitarianism of the Present.

          Meanwhile the "liberal" tendencies of modern theological thought
          have produced throughout Christendom a very large number of
          theological teachers who, while not separating themselves from
          the trinitarian churches, are definitely antitrinitarian
          trinitarian in their doctrine of God. Accordingly, although the
          organized Unitarian churches, which were earlier not
          unproductive of men of high quality (e.g., John James Tayler,
          James Martineau, James Drummond, in England; Theodore Parker,
          Andrews Norton, Ezra Abbot, A. P. Peabody, F. H. Hedge, James
          Freeman Clarke, in America), show no large power of growth, it
          is probable that at no period in the history of the Christian
          Church has there been a more distinguished body of
          antitrinitarian teachers within its fold. Every variety of
          antitrinitarianism finds its representatives among them. The
          Arian tendency is, indeed, discoverable chiefly in the high
          subordinationism of men who do not wish to break with the church
          doctrine of the Trinity (Franck, Twesten, Kahnis, Meyer, Beck,
          Doedes, Van Oosterzee), though a true Arianism is not unexampled
          (Hofstede de Groot). In sequence to the constructions of Kant
          and his idealistic successors, a great number of recent
          theologians from Schleiermacher down have stated their doctrine
          of God in terms of one or another form of modalism (De Wette,
          Hase, Nitzsch, Rothe, Biedermann, Lipsius, Pfleiderer, Kaftan),
          though sometimes, or of late ordinarily, this modalism is
          indistinguishable from Socinianism, allowing only a "Trinity of
          revelation"--of God in nature (the Creation), in history
          (Christ), and in the conscience (the Church). Consonant with the
          general drift of modern thought this recent antitrinitarianism
          is commonly, however, frankly Socinian, and recognizes only a
          monadistic Godhead and only a human Jesus (cf. A. B. Bruce, The
          Humiliation of Christ, Edinburgh, 1881, Lecture v.; James Orr,
          The Christian View of God and the World, Edinburgh, 1903,
          Lecture vii., and notes). The most striking instance of this
          bald Socinianism is furnished probably by A. Ritschl, but a no
          less characteristic example is afforded by W. Beyschlag, who
          admits only an ideal preexistence in the thought of God for
          Jesus Christ, and affirms of the Holy Spirit that the
          representation that he is a third divine person "is one of the
          most disastrous importations into the Holy Scriptures." See
          [442]Ritschl, Albrecht Benjamin; [443]Trinity.

   Anton, Paul
          ANTON, PAUL: Lutheran; b. at Hirschfelde (near Zittau, 50 m.
          e.s.e. of Dresden), in Upper Lausitz, Feb. 2, 1661; d. at Halle
          Oct. 20, 1730. He studied at Leipsic, became tutor there, and
          helped to found Francke's Collegia biblica (see [449]Pietism).
          In 1687-89 he traveled in southern Europe as chaplain to the
          future Elector of Saxony Frederick Augustus, and on his return
          became superintendent at Rochlitz. In 1693 he was summoned as
          court chaplain to Eisenach, and two years later was appointed
          professor in the newly established university at Halle. With
          [450]J. J. Breithaupt and [451]A. H. Francke, Anton gave to the
          Hallensian theology its pietistic character, and he helped
          largely to make the university one of the leading schools of
          Protestant theology in Germany. He adhered more closely than his
          colleagues to the orthodox Lutheran doctrine. His peculiar
          activity was in the field of practical theology. As professor of
          polemics, he sought to ground that study upon psychological
          principles. "Every one," he was accustomed to say, "carries
          within himself the seeds of unbelief and heresy; and
          introspection is a more fruitful means for ascertaining the true
          principles of belief than personal or sectarian controversy."
          The Lord, he taught, would forgive a thousand faults and
          transgressions, but not hypocrisy or unfaithfulness to duty. The
          consciousness of sin was always present with him, and he
          impressed himself upon his auditors by his evident sincerity.
          Anton's lectures were edited in part by Schwenzel in 1732 under
          the title Collegium antitheticum. His devotional works--such as
          Evangelische Hausgespräch von der Erlösung (Halle, 1723) and
          Erbauliche Betrachtung über die sieben Worte Christi am Kreuz
          (1727)--attained great popularity.

   Antonelli, Giacomo
          ANTONELLI, ??n"to-nel´lî, GIACOMO, j??´cO-mO: Cardinal secretary
          of state under Pius IX. and chief political adviser of that
          pope; b. at Sonnino (64 m. s.e. of Rome), in the then Papal
          States, Apr. 2, 1806; d. in Rome Nov. 6, 1876. He received his
          earlier education at the Roman Seminary, then studied law at the
          Sapienza, and, after holding several minor posts in the papal
          government, was appointed delegate or governor successively of
          Orvieto, Viterbo, and Macerata. He showed so much force and
          judgment at the outbreak of the revolution of 1831 that Gregory
          XVI. found a place for him in the Ministry of the Interior,
          transferring him in 1845 to the position of treasurer of the
          Camera Apostolica or minister of finance. On his appointment in
          1840 as canon of St. Peter's he received deacon's orders, but he
          never became a priest. Pius IX. made him a cardinal in 1847, and
          on the organization of the municipal council, in the autumn of
          that year, named him as its president. A few months later, on
          the establishment of a ministry on modern lines, he was again
          placed at the head (as president of the council, though Recchi
          was nominally prime minister), but soon resigned the position,
          becoming prefect of the pontifical palaces, in which position he
          organized the flight to Gaeta. Thence, as secretary of state, he
          conducted the negotiations which led to the pope's return (Apr.
          12, 1850); from which date till his death he remained at the
          head of public affairs under Pius IX.

          As the strongest supporter of the reactionary policy, Antonelli
          was regarded by the Liberals as an incarnation of evil; but
          materials are not yet at hand for the formation of a final
          judgment on his career. His opponents, however, admit that he
          was a man of genius in diplomacy and of unswerving constancy in
          the defense of his principles. His private life has been
          bitterly attacked, and it is true that he was more statesman
          than cleric. Whatever may be thought of his character, however,
          he was one of the strong men of the nineteenth century; and his
          name will be indissolubly connected in history with that of the
          pontiff whom he served so faithfully. See [452]Pius IX.

   Antonians
          ANTONIANS, an-tO´ni-ans, or ANTONINES, an"to-nainz´: 1.
          Religious orders among the Roman Catholic Chaldeans, Maronites,
          and Armenians, which follow a rule called the rule of St.
          Anthony. In reality St. Anthony (251-356), although he is justly
          styled the father of cenobitic life, left no rule to his
          followers save those scattered directions found in his writings.
          The so-called rule of St. Anthony is, therefore, the work of
          some later writer who took its substance, however, from the
          teachings of the saint. At the present time the Antonians are
          grouped in four congregations; the Chaldean Antonians of St.
          Hormisdas, founded in Mesopotamia in 1809 for missionary work,
          with about one hundred members; the Maronite Antonians of
          Aleppo, with 120 members; the Maronite Baladite Antonians, the
          most numerous of all, with 700 members; and the Maronite
          Congregation of St. Isaiah, with 240 members.

          John T. Creagh.

          A fifth congregation called after St. Anthony, now almost
          extinct, was founded among the Roman Catholic Armenians by
          Abraham Attar-Muradian, a merchant, who in 1705, with his
          brother James, a priest, retired to Mount Lebanon to lead an
          ascetic life. Here, in 1721, they established the monastery of
          Kerem, followed by another at Beit-Khasbo near Beirut. In 1761 a
          third community was founded in Rome, near the Vatican. About
          1740 the exiled bishop of Haleb (Aleppo), Abraham Ardzivian, who
          had found refuge at Kerem, took advantage of a long vacancy in
          the Cilician patriarchate to set himself up as catholicos of
          Cilicia, and secured papal confirmation in 1742. His first
          successor was the above-mentioned James, who was followed by
          Michael and Basil, also Antonians. In 1866 the patriarch of the
          Catholic Armenians, Anthony Hasun, residing in Constantinople,
          adopted the title "Patriarch of Cilicia," and put an end to the
          nominal Antonian patriarchate. The Antonians usually numbered
          fifty or sixty, and served the Roman Catholic mission in Turkey.
          In 1834 they transferred their novitiate and school to Rome,
          only the abbot and a few brothers remaining in the Lebanon. In
          1865 Sukias Gazanjian was chosen abbot and was consecrated by
          the last Lebanon patriarch. He lived in Constantinople as head
          of the anti-Hasun party. On Hasun's charges, he was summoned to
          Rome in 1869; but before his case could be heard, the Vatican
          council met. He and his monks were among the first to reject
          papal infallibility, and were obliged to escape by night, with
          the help of the French ambassador. In 1876 Malachi Ormanian, the
          best-known and best-educated of the Antonians, went to Rome and
          finally closed their house there. (He afterward joined the
          Armenian Church, and has published Le Vatican et les Arméniens
          and other works.) The present members of the congregation,
          having made their submission to the pope, are concentrated in
          one community in Constantinople.

          2. An antinomian sect which originated in the canton of Bern,
          Switzerland, early in the nineteenth century, founded by Anton
          Unternährer (b. at Schüpfheim, in the canton of Lucerne, Sept.
          5, 1759; d. in the jail of Lucerne June 29, 1824). Unternährer
          was educated and confirmed in the Roman Catholic Church; after a
          varied career as cowherd, cabinet-maker, private teacher, and
          quack doctor, he settled in 1800 at Amsoldingen, near Thun, and
          began to hold religious meetings, to preach, and to issue books.
          He announced himself as the Son of God, come to fulfil the
          incomplete work of Jesus, to judge mankind (especially rulers
          and judges, who were all to be abolished), and to cancel all
          debts. On Apr. 16, 1802, he appeared before the Minster of Bern
          with a crowd of adherents, to whom he had predicted the
          occurrence of some great event. The tumult was suppressed, and
          Unternährer was condemned to two years' imprisonment. On his
          release he was received by his adherents with enthusiasm, and
          riots again occurred. For five years Unternährer was confined in
          Lucerne as a lunatic. He returned to the world more collected
          and more serious, but by no means cured, and in 1820 he was
          permanently confined in the jail.

          Unternährer's publications comprise about fifteen pamphlets,
          including, with others, Gerichtsbüchlein; Buch der Erfüllung;
          and Geheimniss der Liebe. He taught that the primitive relation
          between God and man was expressed in the two commandments, to
          love and multiply, and to abstain from the tree of knowledge.
          Tempted by Satan, man violated the second commandment and
          attained great wisdom, which is the curse of mankind. It began
          with the distinction between good and evil, and ends in
          institutions innumerable--State, Church, courts, schools, and
          the like. From the curse there is only one means of salvation;
          namely, through the fulfilment of the first commandment, to love
          and multiply; and for this purpose all restraints arising from
          such ideas as marriage, family, etc., must be thrown off. The
          principal seat of the sect was Amsoldingen, whence it spread to
          Gsteig, near Interlaken. Suppressed here in 1821, it reappeared
          at Wohlen, near Bern, in 1830, under the leadership of Benedict
          Schori, and again at Gsteig, in 1838-40, under the leadership of
          Christian Michel. Severe measures were necessary to suppress its
          excesses.

   Antoninus Pius
          ANTONINUS, an"to-nai´nus, PIUS: Roman emperor 138-161; b. near
          Lanuvium (Civita Lavigna, 18 m. s.s.e. of Rome) Sept. 19, 86; d.
          at Lorium (in southern Etruria, 12 Roman miles from Rome) Mar.
          7, 161. He was made consul in 120 and was adopted by Hadrian in
          138, after he had distinguished himself by his administration of
          the province of Asia. On his accession as emperor he took the
          name Titus Ælius Hadrianus Antoninus Pius, his original one
          having been Titus Aurelius Fulvius Boionius Arrius Antoninus.
          Under his just and gentle rule the empire enjoyed almost
          unbroken peace. In his last years he left the government more
          and more in the hands of his associate, [453]Marcus Aurelius,
          with whom he was on terms of the closest friendship. For the
          Christian Church his reign is marked by the flourishing of
          Marcion and the Gnostic schools, by the apology of Aristides and
          the writings of Justin, probably by the Oratio of Tatian, and
          possibly by the final edition of the Shepherd of Hermas. Within
          the same period fall the beginning of the Easter controversy,
          the visit of Polycarp and Hegesippus to Rome, the rise of the
          monarchical episcopate in that city, and the early stages of the
          consolidation against Gnosticism of the Roman Church. The civil
          magistrates observed the same policy of tolerance toward the
          Church as under Trajan and Hadrian. Practically, however, by
          forbidding or rendering difficult the delation of the Christians
          on a charge of atheism by the excited population of Asia Minor,
          as well as by his edicts addressed "to the people of Larissa,
          Thessalonica, Athens, and all the Greeks," Antoninus so far
          protected them that he was considered by many ecclesiastical
          writers as a positive friend of the new religion. His
          prohibition of denunciation by fanatical private citizens,
          however, can not be taken as equivalent to an official sanction
          for the practise of Christianity.

   Antoninus, Saint, of Florence
          ANTONINUS, SAINT, OF FLORENCE (ANTONIO PIEROZZI): Archbishop of
          Florence; b. in that city 1389; d. there May 2, 1459. In 1404 he
          joined the Dominicans, and in 1436 was made prior of the
          monastery of San Marco in Florence. In 1439 he took part in the
          negotiations for union with the Greeks. In 1446, against his
          wish but at the express behest of Pope Eugenius IV., he was
          chosen archbishop. His blameless life and devotion to duty
          rendered him beloved by all, and his canonization by Adrian VI.
          in 1523 was looked upon as the just due of an untiring, humble,
          and exemplary bishop. He has been a favorite subject of
          Florentine art.

          The humanistic tendency of the time had no effect upon
          Antoninus. He wrote certain works quite in the scholastic
          spirit, as: Summa theologica (4 parts, Venice and Nuremberg,
          1477; ed. P. and B. Ballerini, Verona, 1740), based upon Thomas
          Aquinas, the first text-book of ethics, and still esteemed in
          Italy; Summa confessionalis or Summula confessionum (Mondovi,
          1472); and Summa historialis or Chronicon ab orbe condita
          bipartitum (3 vols., Venice, 1480, and often; ed. P. Maturus, S.
          J., Lyons, 1587), a world-chronicle to 1457, uncritical and full
          of fables and legends, but showing industry and systematic
          arrangement. Here and there, as in judging of the great schism,
          he ventures to advance his own opinion and he questions the
          genuineness of the Donation of Constantine. A complete edition
          of Antoninus' works, in four volumes, was published at Venice,
          1474-75, and a second edition, in eight volumes, at Florence,
          1741. In later years have appeared: Opera a ben vivere di Sant'
          Antonino (Florence, 1858) and Lettere (1859).

   Antonio de Lebrija

          Antonius Nebrissensis, i.e., "of Lebrija," the ancient Nebrissa,
          on the Guadalquivir, 34 m. s. of Seville): Spanish humanist; b.
          1442 (1444?); d. at Alcala July 2, 1522. He studied in his
          native land, and for about ten years in Italy, and returned to
          Spain with a plan for reforming the schools and studies. As
          professor in Salamanca and by his Introductiones in Latinam
          grammaticam (1481; innumerable editions, translations, and
          adaptations, even as late as Paris, 1858; an Eng. ed., London,
          1631), he led the way to a knowledge of the classics. Retiring
          from the university, he spent eight or ten years in the
          preparation of a Latin-Spanish and Spanish-Latin lexicon
          (Seville, n.d.; Alcala, 1532; and often), a pioneer work at that
          time. He published also archeological works and a grammar of
          Greek and of Castilian, and labored to improve the text of the
          Vulgate. He was one of the chief workers on the Complutensian
          polyglot, and spent his last years as teacher at Alcala,
          protected by Cardinal Ximenes from the attacks of the adherents
          of the old scholastic school. As historiographer to Ferdinand
          the Catholic he wrote a history of two decades of the reign of
          Ferdinand and Isabella (Granada, 1545) [by some assigned to
          Hernando da Pulgar rather than to Antonio; cf. Potthast,

   Apharsachites
          APHARSACHITES, a-f??r'sa-kaits, APHARSATHCHITES,
          a-f??r"sath´kaits, APHARSITES, a-f??r'saits: Words occurring
          only in the Book of Ezra (Apharsachites, v. 6; Apharsathchites
          and Apharsites, iv. 9). Most translators and commentators have
          regarded them as names of peoples, including them among the
          tribes settled in Samaria by the Assyrians (II Kings xvii. 24),
          and have made unsatisfactory attempts to identify them (e.g.,
          the Apharsites with the Parrhasii of East Media--so M. Hiller,
          Onomasticum sacrum, Tübingen, 1706--or with the
          Persians--Gesenius, Thesaurus; Ewald, Geschichte Israels; E.
          Bertheau, commentary on Ezra, Göttingen, 1838). The best
          explanation has been given by Eduard Meyer (Entstehung des
          Judenthums, Halle, 1896, pp. 37 sqq.), following a hint of G.
          Hoffmann (in ZA, ii., 1887, pp. 54 sqq.). He regards
          "Apharsachites" and "Apharsathchites" as equivalent, the "th"
          (the Hebrew letter tau) having been inserted in the latter by
          mistake, and gives to all three words the same meaning,
          "Persians." The passage Ezra iv. 9, accordingly, he reads:
          "Rehum the commissioner and Shimshai the scribe, and the rest of
          their colleagues the Persian magistracy, the Persian tarpelaye,
          the people of Erech, Babylon, and Shushan, that is, the
          Elamites." The word tarpelaye (English versions "Tarpelites") is
          left untranslated as necessarily meaning an official class of
          some unknown sort and not the name of a people. It is possible,
          however, that the "Apharsites" are not "Persians," but that the
          form arose by dittography, the word for scribe (saphera) just
          above being first copied by mistake and then assimilated to the
          form for "Persians." If "Apharsites" were to be thus ruled out
          of the verse and the Bible, the "Tarpelites" would be an unknown
          people heading the list like those that follow, and not the name
          of a class of officials.

          J. F. McCurdy.

   Aphraates
          APHRAATES, a fr??´tîz: The "Persian sage." He is known as the
          author of twenty-two homilies, arranged according to the letters
          of the Syriac alphabet, and a treatise, De acino benedicto (Isa.
          lxv. 8), in Syriac. The first ten homilies were written in the
          years 336-337, the others in 344-345; the treatise in Aug., 345.
          The latter is mentioned in Armenian lists of the apocryphal
          books. In the life of Julianus Saba (P. Bedjan, Acta martyrum et
          sanctorum, vi., Paris, 1896, p. 386) it is said that Aphraates
          was a pupil of Julianus and that he died, according to some, at
          the age of 104 years. If this be true he may have been the
          Aphraates mentioned by Theodoret (Hist. eccl., iv. 22-23), who
          had an interview with Valens. The name occurs again in the
          Syriac martyrology of the year 411. Its form in modern Persian
          is Farhad. The name Jacobus seems to have been adopted by
          Aphraates as bishop of the monastery of Mar Mattai, near Mosul
          (cf. G. P. Badger, The Nestorians, i., London, 1852, p. 97).

          With Ephraem Syrus, Aphraates may be called the first classic
          writer of the Syrian Church. His style is pure, and he shows
          deep knowledge of the Scriptures, with earnest zeal for the
          welfare of the Church. There is no trace of the christological
          controversies of Arius, a single polemical passage against
          Valentinians, Marcionites, and Manicheans, but many against the
          Jews, from whose traditions Aphraates draws richly (cf. S. Funk,
          Die haggadischen Elemente in Aphraates, Vienna 1891). He used
          the Diatessaron of Tatian instead of the single Gospels. The
          sixth homily shows that monks and eremites were already
          organized in his time and place. His psychology is peculiar,
          especially his doctrine of the sleep of the soul. His days are
          Jan. 29 (Greek calendar) and Apr. 7.

          Gennadius of Marseilles, in his De viris illustribus (c. 495),
          confounded Aphraates with Jacob of Nisibis, under whose name
          nineteen of the homilies were published in an Armenian
          translation by N. Antonelli (Rome, 1756). George, bishop of the
          Arabians, in a letter about 714 (P. de Lagarde, Analecta
          Syriaca, Leipsic, 1858; German transl. by V. Ryssel, ib. 1891),
          is better informed. The Syriac original was first made
          accessible by W. Wright (The Homilies of Aphraates, the Persian
          Sage, i., text, London, 1869; the translation did not appear).
          With Latin translation the homilies are in Patrologia Syriaca,
          i. (Paris, 1894). There is a German translation by G. Bert (TU,
          iii. 3, Leipsic, 1888), and an English translation of selections
          in NPNF, 2d ser., vol. xiii.

   Apion
          APION, ê´pe-on: Alexandrian grammarian of the first century. He
          was born in the Great Oasis of Egypt, was educated in
          Alexandria, and gained repute there as teacher and lecturer;
          during the reigns of Tiberius and Claudius he lectured on
          rhetoric and grammar in Rome; under Caligula he traveled through
          Greece and Italy lecturing on Homer. He seems to have been vain
          and superficial, with a touch of the charlatan in his character.
          Among other works, he wrote a glossary on Homer, a eulogy of
          Alexander the Great, and a history of Egypt. But it is as an
          early anti-Semite that Apion is remembered; his hatred of the
          Jews was bitter and extreme and led him to record slanders in
          his history of Egypt which are refuted by Josephus in his work
          known as Contra Apionem, although but a part of it is directed
          against Apion. In the year 40 A.D. Apion headed a delegation
          sent from Alexandria to Caligula at Rome to make charges against
          the Jews; the counterdelegation, sent by the Jews for their
          defense, was led by [456]Philo. The extant fragments of Apion's
          historical works are collected in C. O. Müller's Fragmenta
          historicorum Groecorum, iii. (Paris, 1849), pp. 506-516.

   Apocalyptic Literature, Jewish
          APOCALYPTIC LITERATURE, JEWISH: The latest type of Jewish
          prophetic writing. The literature generally called "apocalyptic"
          commences with Daniel (for date, see [461]Daniel, Book of) and
          closes with IV Ezra-Baruch.

  Fundamental Characteristics.

          On the one side, the limit is the time of the Maccabean rising;
          on the other, the downfall of the Jewish nationality. The notion
          of two ages following each other (this age and the coming one;
          cf. IV Ezra, vii. 50, "The Most High made not one age, but
          two"), which stands also in the background of New Testament
          literature, governs apocalyptic conceptions. The underlying idea
          here is dualism, the thought being that God alone is not in full
          control of "this age," since diabolic might finds exercise
          therein. It is interesting to observe how through Jewish
          apocalyptic the idea of "world" as a whole, developing itself
          according to certain laws, is made familiar to later Judaism
          (cf. Dan. vii. 1 sqq.; Enoch lxxxv. sqq.; Baruch xxvii. sqq.),
          and how the inner, significant, religious-historical development
          of Judaism is conditioned by its external history. In its
          developed form apocalyptic literature originated in a period
          when a civilized power, the Hellenic, ruling the world by
          external might and inner mental superiority, entered upon a
          contest with Judaism, in which the latter, aroused to national
          consciousness, accepted the gage of battle. The Greek power, and
          afterward the Roman, supplied the apocalyptic seer with the
          material for the formation of his conceptions. Thus the time of
          the Maccabees is the natal hour of the Jewish apocalyptic, and
          Daniel is its mental creator.

          Two other thoughts permeate Jewish apocalyptic: the idea of a
          world-judgment and the hope of resurrection from the dead. The
          idea of the great judgment and of God as judge of the world
          permeates Jewish literature subsequent to the writing of Dan.
          vii. In their entire purity and complete ethical power these
          thoughts come out only in the gospel; but the two thoughts, that
          in this age God is an absentee and that at its end he will
          destroy his world-adversaries in the great judgment, rule the
          Jewish idea of God. The belief in the resurrection of the dead,
          which is still greatly limited in Daniel, only gradually took
          hold of the Jewish national soul. The Psalms of Solomon know
          little of it (xvii. 44); it prevailed in the time of Jesus, when
          denial of the doctrine was regarded as disloyalty. The hope of a
          resurrection of the dead gave a strongly individualistic
          character to apocalyptic piety: it suggested inquiry about the
          final lot of the individual--how the individual could stand in
          judgment before God. This individualism was a consequence of the
          piety of Jeremiah and the Psalms; but the thought of individual
          responsibility in the final judgment nowhere developed in
          Judaism its full ethical force, and it was stifled again and
          again by the fanciful expectations of national greatness on
          earth, or was applied in Pharisaic party polemic against the
          "impious and apostates."

          In general it must be emphasized that, when compared with the
          preceding epoch, this apocalyptic does not imply an advance of
          religious individualism; it reveals rather a stronger influx of
          national elements into the piety of Judaism. In the Maccabean
          period the piety of later Judaism became again national piety.
          The temper of apocalyptic was thoroughly particularistic and
          narrowly national. God's kingdom involved only mercy to Israel
          and judgment to the heathen (Psalms of Solomon xvii. 2). In
          spite of the transcendental and ideal character which the
          apocalyptic picture gradually assumed (cf. the idea of a "coming
          age," world-judgment, waking from the dead), the old, earthly
          hopes of Israel of a kingdom of Davidic glory, a Messiah bearing
          David's name, an earthly empire, and a gloriously renewed
          Jerusalem are closely bound up with it. This divergence shows
          itself especially in the position which the expected Messiah
          occupied in this literature. With the world-judgment, the
          destruction of the world, and the awaking from the dead, the
          expected Davidic king was to have little to do; consequently his
          form occasionally disappeared entirely (so in Daniel and the
          Assumption of Moses). On the whole, however, the transcendental
          retained its position; at one time it was only partly pushed
          aside (Enoch xc. 4; IV Ezra vii. 28; Baruch xxix.); at another,
          it partly corresponded to the picture of hope which involved an
          ideal transfiguration (cf. Psalms of Solomon xvii., and the
          "similitudes" in Enoch). This divergence led finally to the
          assumption of a double finale: first, the intermediate Messianic
          realm (Rev. xx.; Book of the Secrets of Enoch xxxiii.), in which
          earthly expectations were to be realized; and, second, the
          "coming age," ushered in by the world-judgment and the
          resurrection from the dead which should satisfy the more
          transcendental aspirations (cf. Enoch xciii., xci.12-19; IV Ezra
          vii. 28-29; Baruch xl. 3; Rev. xx.; Book of the Secrets of Enoch
          xxxiii.).

  External Qualities.

          With this fundamental character of Jewish apocalyptic a number
          of external qualities are connected. All apocalyptic writers
          indulged in fanciful computation of the end. The apocalyptic
          seer lived in a time when all felt that the prophetic spirit had
          departed, when important decisions awaited the coming of a
          prophet (I Macc. iv. 40; cf. ix. 27, xiv. 41) and the judgment
          of prophecy (Zech. xiii. 2 sqq.). Apocalyptic arithmetic took
          the place of prophecy; thus in the center of Daniel's prophecies
          (Dan. ix.) the seventy years of Jeremiah are interpreted as
          seventy year-weeks (i.e., 70 X 7 years), which interpretation is
          followed by Enoch lxxxix. sqq.; or the duration of the world was
          estimated on the basis of some hidden wisdom (Assumption of
          Moses i. 1, x. 12; Enoch xc., xci.; IV Ezra xiv. 11; Baruch
          liii.), for only the wise and intelligent could understand these
          secrets (Rev. xiii. 18, xvii. 9; Mark xiii. 14). A consequence
          of the foregoing is the non-creative character of this
          literature; it followed closely the older literature of Israel,
          especially the idea of theophanies (Isa. vi. and Ezek. i.), the
          prophecies concerning Babylon (Isa. xiii., xiv.; Jer. l.-li.),
          Tyre (Ezek. xxvii., xxviii.), and Gog and Magog (Ezek. xxxviii.,
          xxxix.). The most promiscuous notions and views from other
          religious departments crept in, and these, understood only in
          part or not at all, were circulated as coins stamped once for
          all. Behemoth and Leviathan, the dragon, the beast with seven
          heads, the four ages, the seven spirits, the twenty-four elders,
          the candlestick with seven branches, the two witnesses, and the
          woman clothed with the sun--all these imply great religious
          historical connections which can not now be fully understood,
          but which nevertheless existed. A necessary rule for the
          interpretation of apocalyptic literature is that a single
          apocalypse can not be explained in itself, but only from a
          survey comprising, if possible, all related works. The fantastic
          element in Jewish apocalyptic literature is not due to an excess
          of imagination in these authors, who were so poor in spirit; the
          impression of strangeness is due to the use of abnormal
          religious images. For discussion of the several books, see
          [462]Apocrypha, B, IV.; [463]Pseudepigrapha, Old Testament, II.,
          4-21.

          In Modern Times (§ 5).

  1. Earliest Advocates.

          By Apocatastasis ("restoration") is meant the ultimate
          restitution of all things, including the doctrine that
          eventually all men will be saved. The term comes from the Greek
          of Acts iii. 21, but is given a wider meaning than it has in
          that passage. The doctrine first appears in Clement of
          Alexandria (flourished 200) in the declaration that the
          punishments of God are "saving and disciplinary, leading to
          conversion" (Strom., vi. 6). His successor at the head of the
          Alexandrian catechetical school, Origen (186-253), taught that
          all the wicked would be restored after they had undergone severe
          punishment and had received instruction from angels and then
          from those of higher grade (De principiis, I. vi. 1-3). He also
          raised the question whether after this world there perhaps would
          be another or others in which this instruction would be given
          (De principiis, II. iii. 1), and interpreted Paul's teaching
          respecting the subjection of all things to God as implying the
          salvation of the "lost" (De principiis, III. v. 7). These
          beliefs and speculations he based on Bible statements
          (especially on Ps. cx. 1; I Cor. xv. 25 sqq.), but declared that
          the doctrine would be dangerous to disseminate (Contra Celsum,
          vi. 26). He, and it would seem, Clement of Alexandria also,
          advocated the Apocatastasis as part of a theory of the divine
          attributes which subordinated righteousness to mercy; of human
          freedom, which made the will never finally fixed; and of sin,
          which represented it rather as weakness and ignorance.

          Similar ideas of the divine goodness, human freedom, and sin led
          to the advocacy of the Apocatastasis by Gregory Nazianzen
          (328-389), but not openly; by Gregory of Nyssa (332-398),
          publicly, as in his treatise "On the Soul and the Resurrection"
          (MPG, xlvi. 104); by Didymus of Alexandria (308-395), in his
          commentary on I Peter iii. (in Galland, Bibliotheca patrum, vi.
          292 sqq.); and by Diodorus of Tarsus (flourished 375), in his
          treatise "On the Divine Economy" (in J. S. Assemanus,
          Bibliotheca orientalis, III. i. 324). Even Chrysostom (347-407),
          when commenting on I Cor. xv. 28, quoted without contradiction
          the view that by the expression "God shall be all in all" was
          meant universal cessation of opposition to God (MPG, lxi. 342).
          So also the Monophysite, Stephen bar-Sudaili, abbot of a
          monastery at Edessa in the sixth century, advocated the
          Apocatastasis in a treatise which he wrote on the subject under
          the name of Hierotheus (as is stated in Assemanus, ut sup., ii.
          290 sqq.). It was taught also by Maximus Confessor (580-662),
          called by the Greeks Theologos and revered as the leader of the
          Orthodox against the Monothelites, drawing from Gregory of
          Nyssa, as in his answer to the thirteenth question of his
          "Questions and Doubts" (MPG, xc. 796). The existence of this
          belief in the eighth century is shown by the warning against it
          given in 718 by Pope Gregory II., when sending out missionaries
          (MPL, lxxxix. 534). In the ninth century it was roundly asserted
          by that very independent speculative theologian Johannes Scotus
          Erigena, in the third book of his treatise "On the Division of
          Nature" (MPL, cxxii. 619-742). He drew from Origen,
          pseudo-Dionysius Areopagita, Gregory of Nyssa, and still more
          directly, from Maximus Confessor.

  2. Opponents.

          But the writers defending the Apocatastasis are decidedly in the
          minority; and so bad was the repute of Origen for sound thinking
          that any theory known to be derived from him was looked at
          askance by the sober-minded. Jerome (d. 420), for example,
          reckoned the Apocatastasis among the "abhorrent" heresies of
          Origen (Epist., cxxxiv.). The emperor Justinian, in his edict
          against Origen, issued in 545, made it the ninth of the ten
          doctrines for which the latter should be anathematized; and
          when, at Justinian's call, a council met in Constantinople that
          same year to condemn Origen, the doctrine appears as the
          fourteenth of the fifteen for which he was cursed (Hefele,
          Conciliengeschichte, ii. 789, 797, Eng. transl., iv. 220, 228).

          In the West, Augustine (354-430) threw his influence against the
          Apocatastasis, teaching in the most unmistakable language the
          absolute endlessness of future punishment (e.g., "City of God,"
          xxi, 11-23).

  3. In the Middle Ages.

          At a later period the doctrine appears in the teachings of the
          great pantheistic thinker Amalric of Bena (d. 1204), only to be
          again condemned by the Western Church; for it was one of the
          counts upon which Amalric was declared a heretic by Pope
          Innocent III., and for which his followers, the Brethren and
          Sisters of the Free Spirit, after his death, were condemned by
          the Fourth Lateran Council, in 1215 (Hefele, ut sup., pp. 863,
          881). It appears also among the mystics. Jan Ruysbroeck
          (1293-1381), Johann Middle Tauler (1300-61), and Johann von Goch
          (d. 1475) are said to have accepted it; but it was rejected by
          Eckhart (flourished 1300), Suso (1300-65), and their followers
          (cf. C. Ullmann, Reformers before the Reformation, i.,
          Edinburgh, 1855). Still later it is found as one of the 900
          theses which that brilliant scholar Giovanni Pico della
          Mirandola proposed to defend in public debate in Rome in 1487,
          and was thus expressed: "A mortal sin of finite duration is not
          deserving of eternal but only of temporal punishment." But it
          was among the theses pronounced heretical by Pope Innocent VIII.
          in his bull of Aug. 4, 1484; and the debate was never held (cf.
          Giovanni Pico della Mirandola, ed. J. M. Rigg, London, 1890, pp.
          vii. sqq.).

  4. The Reformation.

          The Apocatastasis emerged in the Protestant Church of the
          earliest days. Thus Luther, writing on Aug. 18, 1522, to Hans
          von Rechenberg, who had asked him if there was any salvation for
          those out of Christ at death, states that a belief in the
          ultimate salvation of all men, and even of the devil and his
          angels, was held among the sect of Free Spirits in the
          Netherlands, one of whom was then in Wittenberg. They based it
          on Ps. lxxvii. 9, 10 and on I Tim. ii. 4. He then proceeds to
          refute it. Again Luther warns against this belief when writing
          to the Christians in Antwerp in 1525 (cf. de Wette's ed. of
          Luther's letters, ii. 453 and iii. 62). The doctrine was held
          among the Anabaptists. Hans Denk taught it in its extreme form,
          saying that not only all men, but even the devil and his angels,
          would ultimately be saved; and another Anabaptist leader, Jacob
          Kautz (Cucius), in 1527 at Worms put as the fifth of seven
          articles he propounded for debate: "All that was lost in the
          first Adam is and will be found more richly restored in the
          Second Adam, Christ; yea, in Christ shall all men be quickened
          and blessed forever" (Zwingli, Opera, viii. 77; cf. S. M.
          Jackson, Selections from Zwingli, p. 148). So, too, Zwingli
          asserts that it was part of the Anabaptist creed that the devil
          and all the impious will be blessed (Opera, iii. 435; cf.
          Jackson, ut sup., p. 256). Indeed, while perhaps not universally
          accepted by Anabaptists, it was held by so many of the party in
          Switzerland, Upper Germany, and Alsace that in Article xvii. of
          the Augsburg Confession are these words: "They [the Lutherans]
          condemn the Anabaptists, who think that to condemned men and the
          devils shall be an end of torments." It is, however, not put in
          the Formula of Concord among the erroneous teachings of the
          Anabaptists.

  5. In Modern Times.

          Toward the end of the seventeenth century the doctrine of the
          Apocatastasis again appeared, and ever since it has found
          numerous defenders. The earliest were Mrs. Jane Lead, of London
          (1623-1704), Johann Wilhelm Petersen (1649-1727), and the
          Philadelphian Society which Mrs. Lead founded. With them the
          doctrine was established not only on the Bible, but also on
          personal revelations. It is noteworthy that Jakob Boehme
          (1575-1624), who so greatly influenced them, did not teach it
          (cf. his Beschreibung der drei Prinzipien göttlichen Wesens;
          Eng. transl., Concerning the Three Principles of the Divine
          Essence, London, 1648, chap. xxvii. § 20). There is an elaborate
          defense of the Apocatastasis by Ludwig Gerhard, Vollständiger
          Lehrbegriff der ewigen Evangelli von der Widerbringung aller
          Dinge (Hamburg, 1727). The Philadelphians won over the authors
          of the Berleburg Bibel (1726-42; see [464]Bibles, Annotated, and
          Bible Summaries); but their chief convert was [465]Friedrich
          Christoph Oetinger (1702-82), who wove this tenet into his
          theological system, depending chiefly upon I Cor. xv. and Eph.
          i. 9-11. It is said that Bengel (1687-1752), the father of
          modern exegesis, believed in it, but thought it dangerous to
          teach publicly.

          The rationalists of Germany, after the second half of the
          eighteenth century, commonly and supernaturalists frequently
          have upon various grounds advocated the Apocatastasis. Thus,
          Schleiermacher (1768-1834) was pronounced in its favor, deriving
          his principal arguments from his doctrines of the will and of
          the atonement, and remarking that the sensitiveness of
          conscience in the damned, as revealed in the parable of the rich
          man and Lazarus, shows that they may be better in the next life
          than in this, and also that if a portion of God's creatures were
          forever debarred from participation in the redemption of Christ,
          then there would be an inexplicable dissonance in God's
          universe. Martensen and Dorner considered the probability that
          between death and the last judgment there might be a fresh offer
          of the gospel, but put a rejection and consequent exclusion from
          salvation among the possibilities. The difficulties of the
          estate of the "lost" have driven others, as Rothe, Hermann
          Plitt, and Edward White, to the theory of [466]annihilationism.
          Ritschl thought that such information as the New Testament gives
          hardly admits of a decision between the theories of endless
          punishment and complete annihilation. Friedrich Nitzsch
          considered belief in a final restoration as well founded as the
          opposite view, and admitted the hypothesis of annihilationism as
          a third possibility. In America opposition to the orthodox
          teaching as to the absolute endlessness of conscious suffering
          after death of those excluded from heaven has led to the
          formation of the Universalist denomination (see
          [467]Universalists); and there are many of other religious
          connections in the United States, England, and other countries
          who favor the doctrine of an Apocatastasis in more or less
          modified form. For further discussion consult the histories of
          Christian doctrine and the works mentioned in the article
          [468]Universalists. The teaching of the Roman Catholic Church,
          which is flatly against the doctrine, is presented by J. B.
          Kraus in Die Apokatastasis der unfreien Kreatur (Regensburg,
          1850).

          [Many significant facts indicate a relaxing of the traditional
          rigidity of belief with reference to this subject. There is an
          unwillingness on the part of many to assume any dogmatic
          attitude concerning God's dealing with those who die impenitent.
          Again, there is a refusal to limit probation to the earthly life
          merely, fixing, instead, the decisive moment at the judgment,
          thus making room for those to whom an adequate offer of the
          gospel has been wanting here (cf. Progressive Orthodoxy, by
          professors of Andover Theological Seminary, Boston, 1886).
          Further, denominational approval or disapproval of the theory of
          an Apocatastasis is not so much in evidence as wide and
          influential advocacy of it by distinguished writers and
          preachers in many communions--the attitude partly of dogmatic
          belief, and partly of the "larger hope." It has been represented
          in Great Britain in the Established Church by F. D. Maurice (The
          Word "Eternal" and the Punishment of the Wicked, Cambridge,
          1853), F. W. Farrar (Eternal Hope, London, 1878; Mercy and
          Judgment, 1881), E. H. Plumptre (The Spirits in Prison, London,
          1886); among Baptists by Samuel Cox (Salvator Mundi, London,
          1877; The Larger Hope, 1883); among Independents by J. Baldwin
          Brown (The Doctrine of Annihilation in the Light of the Gospel
          of Love, London, 1875) and R. J. Campbell of the London City
          Temple. In America it has found expression among
          Congregationalists by George A. Gordon (Immortality and the New
          Theodicy, Boston, 1896), and among Baptists the grounds for it
          have been suggested by W. N. Clarke (Outline of Christian
          Theology, New York, 1898, pp. 476-480). Important theoretical
          considerations have influenced this result: (1) The tendency
          toward a monistic theory of the universe. (2) A change in the
          idea of God from that of sovereign and judge to that of father.
          (3) Election conceived of not as limited to a definite portion
          of mankind but, with Schleiermacher, as a historical process,
          therefore in this world only partially, in the world to come to
          be completely, realized. (4) The universal immanence of God and
          hence the presence of ethical and redemptive relations wherever
          the moral consciousness exists. (5) Life regarded less as
          probation than as discipline. (6) Sin defined not so much as
          wilful and incorrigible perversity as natural defect, ignorance,
          and emotional excess, as well as result of unfortunate heredity
          and unworthy environment.

   Apocrisiarius
          APOCRISIARIUS, ap"o-cris"i-ê´ri-Us: A general designation in
          early times for ecclesiastical ambassadors, derived from the
          Greek apokrinesthai "to answer" (hence the Latin term
          responsales for the same class). The name is found applied to
          the legates sent by the pope to guard his metropolitan rights in
          Sicily until the Mohammedan invasion, and to episcopal
          representatives in Rome. The office assumed its most formal and
          important character in the Eastern Church, where the patriarchs
          were represented at the imperial court by apocrisiarii, and
          bishops maintained similar diplomatic agents in the residences
          of the patriarchs. The popes also, at least from Leo the Great
          to the time of the iconoclastic controversy, regularly had
          apocrisiarii in Constantinople; they were sometimes called also
          diaconi, because usually chosen from the order of deacons. The
          officials described here have nothing but the name in common
          with the apocrisiarius of the Frankish ecclesiastical system
          (see [469]Archicapellanus).

  1. Writings Withheld from Public Use.

          Apocrypha is a Greek word meaning "hidden," which, when applied
          to writings, may signify either those which are kept in
          concealment or those the origin of which is unknown. The word is
          used in both senses in patristic literature. When the followers
          of Prodicus, according to Clement of Alexandria (Strom., I. xv.
          69), boasted of possessing the "apocryphal books" of Zoroaster,
          they called these works "apocryphal" not because they did not
          know their origin (since they ascribed them to Zoroaster), but
          because they regarded the books as not to be made public. The
          reason in this case for keeping the writings concealed was the
          special value attached to them. But writings may also be
          withdrawn from general use because they are inferior. With this
          thought in mind Origen and Didymus of Alexandria make a
          distinction between the "common and widely circulated books"
          (Gk. koina kai dedemeumena or dedemosieumena biblia) and the
          apocryphal books of Scripture (Origen on Matt. xiii, 57, ANF,
          ix, 425; Didymus of Alexandria on Acts viii, 39, MPG, xxxix,
          1669). In like manner Eusebius calls the canonical books which
          were used in the churches dedemosieumena (Hist. eccl., III, iii,
          6, and elsewhere). Similarly Jerome (Epist., xcvi) explains the
          Greek apokryphos by the Latin absconditus. (For further
          illustration cf. T. Zahn, Geschichte des neutestamentlichen
          Kanons, i, Leipsic, 1888, 126 sqq.)

          The Christian usage is clearly derived from a Jewish custom. The
          Jews, because they hesitated actually to destroy copies of
          sacred writings, were in the habit of either depositing in a
          secret place (genizah) or of burying such as had become
          defective or were no longer fit for public use. The new-Hebrew
          word for this "concealing" is ganaz, "to save, hoard." Writings
          which were withdrawn from public use because of questionable
          contents were treated in the same way; thus King Hezekiah is
          said to have "stored up" the "Book of Remedies" because it
          prejudiced faith and trust in God (Pesahim iv, 9). Hence ganaz
          came to mean "to declare uncanonical" (Shabbat 30b; cf. Fürst,
          Der Kanon des Alten Testaments, Leipsic, 1868, pp. 91-93). Since
          the Christian phraseology undoubtedly followed the Jewish, it
          can not be questioned that "apocryphal" in ecclesiastical usage
          according to its original and proper signification means nothing
          else than "excluded from public use in the Church."

  2. Writings of Uncertain Origin.

          But "apocryphal" in both Greek and Latin may be applied also to
          writings the origin of which is unknown, and this meaning led to
          that of "forged, spurious." In this sense Augustine speaks of
          "the fables of those scriptures which are called apocryphal
          because their origin, being obscure, was unknown to the fathers"
          (De civitate dei, XV, xxiii, 4, NPNF, 1st ser. ii, 305); and
          again he says the apocryphal books "are so called, not because
          of any mysterious regard paid to them, but because they are
          mysterious in their origin, and in the absence of clear evidence
          have only some obscure presumption to rest upon" (Contra
          Faustum, xi, 2, NPNF, 1st ser. iv, 178). In many cases it can
          not be decided which meaning was intended (cf. Hegesippus in
          Eusebius, Hist. eccl., IV, xxii, 8; Clement of Alexandria,
          Strom., III, iv, 29; Apostolic Constitutions, vi, 16). It seems,
          however, that the original meaning, so sharply and consistently
          expressed in Origen, was not that generally given to the word
          before his time. At any rate, it is questionable whether it was
          clearly present to the mind of Irenæus and Tertullian in the
          following passages. The former, speaking of the Marcosians,
          says: "They adduce an unspeakable number of apocryphal and
          spurious writings, which they themselves have forged" (Hær., I,
          xx, 1, ANF, i, 344); and Tertullian says: "I would yield my
          ground to you, if the scripture of the Shepherd [of Hermas]
          . . . had deserved to find a place in the divine canon; if it
          had not been habitually judged by every council of churches
          . . . among apocryphal and false writings" (De pudicitia, x,
          ANF, iv, 85). After the word was once introduced, its ambiguity
          easily led to a notion differing from the original meaning. In
          the case of Augustine this is certain. Jerome, too, seems to use
          the word in the sense of "obscure in origin" when he says that
          all apocryphal writings "are not really written by those to whom
          they are ascribed" (Epist., cvii, 12, NPNF, 2d ser. xi, 194) The
          two senses--"exclusion from public use in the Church" and
          "obscure in origin"--are often combined in the same passage. The
          meaning became finally so generalized that the word signifies
          simply what is wrong and bad, as in the Latin adaptation of
          Origen's "Preface to the Song of Solomon" at the end: "Those
          writings which are called apocryphal (which contain much that is
          corrupt and contrary to the true faith) should not be given
          place or admitted to authority;"--the words in parentheses
          appear to be added by the Latin editor. (For further information
          cf. C. A. Credner, Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons,
          Berlin, 1860, pp. 110 sqq.; A. Hilgenfeld, Der Kanon und die
          Kritik des Neuen Testaments, Halle, 1863, pp. 6 sqq.; H. J.
          Holtzmann, Einleitung in das Neue Testament, Freiburg, 1892, pp.
          145 sqq.; T. Zahn, Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons, I,
          i, Leipsic, 1888, pp. 123 sqq.)

  3. Use of the Term by Protestants.

          In the ancient Church and in the Middle Ages the term
          "apocryphal" was almost never applied, as in the Protestant
          Church, to those portions of the Greek and Latin Bibles which
          were foreign to the Hebrew canon. Indeed, it could not be so
          applied, for those books have always been a part of the Greek
          and Latin Bibles. Jerome alone once made a statement (in the
          Prologus galeatus) implying that these writings do indeed fall
          into the category of apocrypha. During the Middle Ages there
          were at the most a very few isolated voices which spoke to that
          effect (Hugo of St. Cher; cf. de Wette-Schrader, Einleitung in
          das Alte Testament, Berlin, 1869, p. 66). It was in the
          Protestant Church that this nomenclature first became customary.
          The earliest to introduce it, appealing expressly to Jerome, was
          Carlstadt in his De canonicis scripturis libellus (Wittenberg,
          1520; reprinted in Credner, Zur Geschichte des Kanons, Halle
          1847, pp. 291 sqq.). He there expressly stated that by
          "apocryphal" he understood "non-canonical"; and in this sense
          the Protestant Church has always understood the word. The first
          edition of the Bible in which the writings in question were
          expressly called apocryphal was that of Frankfort, 1534, which
          was followed in the same year by Luther's first edition (cf. G.
          W. Panzer, Geschichte der deutschen Bibelübersetzung, Nuremberg,
          1783, pp. 294 sqq.).

                          A. Old Testament Apocrypha:

          Those portions of the Greek and Latin Old Testaments which are
          not found in the Hebrew Canon, the term "apocrypha" being used
          in this article with the meaning given to it by the Protestant
          Church (see [470]§ 3, above).

I. Position in the Canon:

  1. Apocrypha in the Greek Canon.

          The Hebrew canon of the Bible in the first century of the
          Christian era comprised about the same books as at present,
          though the canonicity of the books of Ecclesiastes and the Song
          of Songs was disputed (Mishnah, Eduyot, v, 3; Yadayim, iii, 5;
          J. Fürst, Der Kanon des Alten Testaments nach den
          Ueberlieferungen in Talmud and Midrasch, Leipsic, 1868; see
          [471]Canon of Scripture, I). But it was otherwise with the
          Hellenistic Jews. As far as the extent of the Greek canon of the
          Bible can be traced, it included a number of writings which are
          wanting in the Hebrew canon. No clear proofs of this from
          pre-Christian times exist; but the fact that Christians using
          the Greek Bible received these other writings also makes it
          highly probable that these belonged to the canon of the
          Hellenistic Jews. While it may be conceded to the opponents of
          this view that Hellenistic Jews had no strict conception of a
          canon, it can not be denied that certain writings were received
          into the Greek Bible-collection which were foreign to the Hebrew
          canon (cf. De Wette-Schrader, Einleitung, pp. 311 sqq.; Bleek,
          TSK, 1853, pp. 323 sqq.). The fact that Philo did not quote
          these other writings proves nothing, since Philo was interested
          mainly in the Pentateuch.

  2. Used in Some New Testament Writings.

          In the New Testament there are no express references to the
          so-called Apocrypha, a fact the more remarkable since most of
          the New Testament authors took their quotations from the Greek
          translation of the Old Testament. But to understand this
          rightly, one must not forget that a number of canonical writings
          of the Old Testament are never cited in the New Testament;
          others only seldom. The Pentateuch, the Prophets, and the Psalms
          are frequently quoted; the historical books not so often; while
          the Song of Songs, Ecclesiastes, Esther, Ezra, and Nehemiah are
          never cited. The lack of express citations can therefore not be
          emphasized; and on the other hand, it can not be denied that at
          least in some writings of the New Testament the Apocrypha are
          used. This applies particularly to the Epistle of James and that
          to the Hebrews. That Ecclesiasticus was known to the author of
          the Epistle of James can not be denied in the face of the many
          parallels (cf. Werner in TQ, 1872, pp. 265 sqq.). The author of
          the Epistle to the Hebrews doubtless refers in xi, 34 sqq. to
          the story of the Maccabees (cf. II Macc. vi, 18-vii, 42).
          Striking agreements with the Wisdom of Solomon are also found
          (thus Heb. i, 3 = Wisdom vii, 26; Heb. iv, 12-13 = Wisdom vii,
          22-24); and there can be no doubt that Paul made use of this
          book (cf. in general Bleek, TSK, 1853, pp. 325 sqq., especially
          337-349).

  3. By the Church Fathers.

          Among the Church Fathers the Apocrypha were in common use from
          the earliest times. Clement of Rome puts "the blessed" Judith
          beside Esther as an example of female heroism (Epist., Iv, ANF,
          ix, 245). Barnabas (xix, 9) goes back to Ecclus. iv, 31 when he
          quotes "Be not ready to stretch forth thy hands to take whilst
          thou withdrawest them from giving." Justin Martyr (Apol., i, 46,
          ANF, i, 178) refers to the additions to Daniel. That none of
          these passages has the form of a true Scripture citation may be
          viewed as accidental and may be explained from the small extent
          of this oldest literature. But from the time of Athenagoras true
          citations can be proved. Athenagoras ("Plea for the Christians,"
          i, 9, ANF, ii, 133) quotes among the "voices of the prophets,"
          as divinely inspired, Baruch iii, 25 upon an equality with Isa.
          xliv, 6; Irenæus (Hær., IV, xxvi, 3, ANF, i, 497) cites as the
          words of "Daniel the Prophet" the history of Susanna, and (Hær.,
          V, xxxv, 1, ANF, i, 565) the Book of Baruch as the work of
          Jeremiah; Tertullian quotes the history of Susanna (De corona,
          iv, ANF, iii, 95), Bel and the Dragon (De idololatria, xviii,
          ANF, iii, 72), and the Wisdom of Solomon (Adversus Valentinos,
          ii, ANF, iii, 504) as canonical Scripture. Clement of Alexandria
          quotes Ecclesiasticus very often with the formula "Scripture,"
          "Holy Scripture," "Wisdom says," and the like, and not so
          frequently, but with the same formulas, Wisdom of Solomon,
          Baruch, and Tobit. Abundant examples of the same practise can be
          cited from Hippolytus, Cyprian, and others.

          In view of these facts it may be asserted that the Church of the
          first centuries made no essential difference between the
          writings of the Hebrew canon and the so-called Apocrypha. Only
          in an isolated way and evidently as the result of learned
          inquiry does an express limitation of the canon to the extent of
          the Hebrew Bible appear; for example, Melito of Sardis,
          according to Eusebius (Hist. eccl., IV, xxvi, 14), mentions only
          the books of the Hebrew canon as canonical, but he gives this
          list expressly as the result of learned inquiry in Palestine.
          When Origen gives a list which comprises only the Hebrew canon
          (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., vi, 25), he gives it as the canon of the
          Hebrews, and his own view can not be deduced from the passage
          given by Eusebius. On the other hand, from Origen's
          correspondence with Julius Africanus it is deducible that he was
          by no means in favor of excluding those parts which were wanting
          in the Hebrew canon, because he defends the Greek additions to
          Daniel, and he likewise cites some Apocryphal writings
          (Maccabees, Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Tobit, Baruch) as
          "Scriptural authority," "the Holy Word," "Scripture," etc. (cf.
          De Wette-Schrader, Einleitung, p. 53). The critique which Julius
          Africanus wrote on the Greek text of the Book of Daniel, trying
          to remove the portions not found in the Hebrew-Aramaic text
          (Epist. ad Origenem), evidently remained an isolated phenomenon.

  4. The Beginning of Exclusion.

          The learned disquisitions of men like Origen resulted, however,
          in this, that stricter regard was paid to the difference between
          the Hebrew and the Greek canon. Wherever the purpose was to fix
          theoretically the range of the canon, recourse was had to the
          Hebrew canon as to something settled over against the
          fluctuations of the Greek canon. Thus there are a number of
          lists of the canonical books from the fourth century which
          confine themselves to the Hebrew canon and either do not mention
          the other writings or assign to them a lower value. Athanasius
          is most instructive in this respect. In his Epistola festalis,
          xxxix (NPNF, 2d ser. iv, 552), after mentioning the canonical
          writings of the Old and New Testaments, he adds Wisdom of
          Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, Esther, Judith, Tobit, Teaching of the
          Apostles, and the Shepherd of Hermas as "not included in the
          canon, but appointed by the Fathers to be read by those who
          newly join us and wish for instruction in the word of
          godliness." The specified writings were to be read in the
          Church, and are expressly differentiated by Athanasius from the
          "Apocrypha"; they are not mentioned at all in the lists of Cyril
          of Jerusalem, Gregory Nazianzen, and Amphilochius (cf. T. Zahn,
          Geschichte, II, i, 172-180, 212-219). The usage of Epiphanius
          varies: in one place he gives only the Hebrew canon; in another
          he mentions also Tobit and Judith as in the canon, while
          Ecclesiasticus and Wisdom of Solomon seem to him "doubtful."
          That he expresses only his own opinion is proved by still a
          third passage (Hær., lxxvi), where after the canonical writings,
          which are not named individually, he mentions Wisdom of Solomon
          and Ecclesiasticus as "Holy Scripture." His wavering was due to
          the fact that, on the one hand, he used the canon of the Jews as
          the norm, while, on the other hand, he was unwilling to give up
          his Greek Bible (cf. T. Zahn, Geschichte, II, i, 219-226). The
          only one who in the ancient Church opposed the Apocrypha was
          Jerome; and this was no doubt due to his Hebrew studies and his
          zeal for the "body of truth in the Hebrew." The principal
          passage is in the Prologus galeatus (NPNF, 2d ser. vi, 489), in
          which he says that the books not on the list he gives must be
          reckoned among the Apocrypha.

          All these declarations, more or less unfavorable to the
          Apocrypha, lose much of their importance from the fact that the
          men who excluded the Apocrypha from the canon use them in an
          impartial manner as though canonical; so Athanasius, Cyril,
          Epiphanius, and even Jerome, who in spite of his theory is not
          afraid to quote Ecclesiasticus as "Sacred Scripture." Roman
          theologians have rightly laid great stress upon this fact; for
          it proves that, notwithstanding opposite theories,
          ecclesiastical practise on the whole was to use the Apocryphal
          like the canonical writings. Moreover, the West decided in their
          favor. Augustine (De doctrina Christiana, ii, 8) counted the
          Apocrypha as canonical, and the same was the case with the
          synods at Hippo (393) and Carthage (397), held under his
          influence (cf. T. Zahn, Geschichte, II, i, 246-259). This
          position was prevalent down to the time of the Reformation,
          though in the Middle Ages there were not lacking voices which
          sided with Jerome (cf. De Wette-Schrader, Einleitung, pp. 64
          sqq.). In the Greek Church of the Middle Ages the Apocrypha were
          as a rule included in the canon.

  5. Accepted by the Roman Catholic Church.

          In the Church of Rome the question concerning the Apocrypha was
          definitively settled by the Council of Trent, which in its
          fourth session fixed the extent of the canon in such a manner
          that it included the Apocrypha. Hence the official edition of
          the Vulgate (that of 1592) includes the Apocrypha with the other
          writings, and in the following order: Nehemiah (numbered as II
          Ezra) is followed by Tobit, Judith, Esther (with the additions),
          Job. Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon, Wisdom of
          Solomon, Ecclesiasticus, Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Baruch
          with the Epistle of Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel with the
          additions, the Twelve Minor Prophets, I and II Maccabees. As an
          appendix (in smaller type and with the explicit statement that
          they stand "outside the series of canonical books"), the Old
          Testament is followed by the Prayer of Manasses, III and IV
          Ezra. From this official canon of the Church of Rome the
          manuscripts and editions of the Greek Bible differ mainly in
          this, that in them III Ezra (which, however, is here always
          numbered as I Ezra) is put on a par with the other writings, IV
          Ezra (as a rule also the Prayer of Manasses) is wanting, III
          Maccabees being substituted for it; some few manuscripts and
          editions contain also IV Maccabees. The arrangement is generally
          this: I Ezra stands before the canonical Ezra; Judith and Tobit
          stand together with Esther; Wisdom, and Ecclesiasticus with the
          Solomonic writings; Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremiah with
          Jeremiah. The position of the books of the Maccabees is the most
          uncertain; in the (printed) editions they generally stand at the
          end of the Old Testament.

  6. Rejected by Protestants.

          In the Protestant Church, Carlstadt (De canonicis scripturis,
          Wittenberg, 1520) was the first to pay special attention to the
          theory of the canon. He sided with Jerome in designating the
          writings in question as "apocrypha," that is, as non-canonical
          writings (cf. Credner, Zur Geschichte des Kanons, p. 364). Yet
          he distinguished within them two classes. On Wisdom,
          Ecclesiasticus, Judith, Tobit, I and II Maccabees, he remarked:
          "These are apocrypha, i.e., outside of the Hebrew canon,
          nevertheless they are holy writings." The others, however, were
          for him "plainly apocrypha, deservedly exposed to the strictures
          of the censor (Credner, 389)." Though this discrimination has
          found no favor, Carlstadt's position is on the whole that of the
          Protestant Church. In the first complete original edition of
          Luther's translation (1534) the Apocrypha formed a supplement to
          the Old Testament with the heading "Apocrypha; that is, books
          which, although not estimated equal to the Holy Scriptures, are
          yet useful and good to read." As to the number of received
          writings, Luther's Bible agreed with the Vulgate, with the
          modification, however, that of the three books found in the
          appendix to the Vulgate the Prayer of Manasses was received, and
          both books of Ezra were excluded. In the Reformed Church the
          apocryphal books have received the same treatment as in the
          Lutheran, except that usually a stricter sentence has been
          passed upon them. In modern times, opposition has twice been
          raised against them, each time in England (1825 and 1850); and
          the result has been a substantial augmentation of information
          about them.

                       II. Manuscripts of the Greek Text:

          As the Apocrypha form an integral part of the Greek Old
          Testament, they are included in the Septuagint manuscripts, of
          which the most important are: (1) the Codex Vaticanus, in which
          the books of Maccabees do not appear; (2) the Codex Sinaiticus,
          containing Esther, Tobit, Judith, I and IV Maccabees, Wisdom,
          Ecclesiasticus; (3) the Codex Alexandrinus, containing all the
          Apocrypha. (For particulars cf. the prolegomena to O. F.
          Fritzsche, Libri Apocryphi Veteris Testamenti Groece, Leipsic,
          1871. On the manuscripts of the Septuagint in general cf. Swete,
          Introduction to the Old Testament in Greek, Cambridge, 1900, pp.
          122-170; see also [472]Bible Text, I, 4, § 2.)

                             III. Ancient Versions:

          Mention is made here of only the Latin and Syriac because they
          are the most important in point of age and circulation.

1. Latin:

  1. The Old Latin and Jerome's Versions.

          Various Old Latin texts of most Apocrypha exist, the
          interrelations of which have not yet been fully investigated
          (cf. Schürer, Geschichte, vol. iii). These must be distinguished
          from Jerome's translation, and an estimate of the amount of the
          Old Latin that has been preserved can be obtained only by
          inference from what is known concerning Jerome's labors. He
          undertook a twofold translation of the Old Testament. At first
          he was satisfied with revising the Old Latin translation on the
          basis of the Septuagint; after that he translated the Old
          Testament anew from the original text (cf. Kaulen, Geschichte
          der Vulgata, Mainz, 1868, pp. 153 sqq.; see [473]Bible Versions,
          A, II, 2), necessarily omitting the Apocrypha, because they were
          not in the original text. Jerome says expressly concerning some
          that he passes them by. In response to special requests he
          worked over two of the apocryphal books, Tobit and Judith, but
          he performed the work hastily and reluctantly and evidently not
          in connection with his great Bible version (cf. the preface to
          both books, Opera, ed. Vallarsi, 11 vols., Verona, 1734-42 x, 1,
          sqq., 21 sqq.). The Vulgate texts of the additions to Esther and
          Daniel are also Jerome's work. He received these into his
          translation from the original text, but marked them with the
          obelus (cf. his remarks on Esther, Opera, ed. Vallarsi, ix,
          1581). The translation of the additions to Esther is so free
          that in some passages it gives merely the general sense. The
          additions to Daniel are translated with greater fidelity, but
          from the text of Theodotion, as noted by Jerome himself. The
          version of these four books passed into the Vulgate. The Vulgate
          contains also the books of Ezra (put into the appendix since the
          Council of Trent), Baruch, and the Epistle of Jeremiah, I and II
          Maccabees, Ecclesiasticus, and Wisdom. Since Jerome did not
          translate these, the Vulgate text is to be regarded as
          essentially the same as that of the Old Latin. The question is
          only whether some of these texts have not undergone correction
          at the hand of Jerome. It is to be regretted that information is
          very meager as to the extent of Jerome's revision of the Old
          Latin which was originally made from the Septuagint. But on two
          Apocrypha, the Wisdom of Solomon and Ecclesiasticus, there is a
          valuable notice in the extant "Preface to the Edition of the
          Books of Solomon according to the LXX" (Vallarsi, x, 436), from
          which it is learned that in Ecclesiasticus and Wisdom of
          Solomon, Jerome "saved the pen," i.e., he did not emend them
          since he "desired to correct only the canonical writings." As by
          "canonical writings" here he refers only to the Solomonic
          literature, it remains a possibility that he nevertheless
          emended the non-Solomonic Apocrypha, Ezra, Baruch, I and II
          Maccabees. And it is at any rate worthy of notice that these
          four books are extant in the Latin in double texts, whereas
          Ecclesiasticus and Wisdom are extant only in the text of the
          Vulgate. The presumption is obvious: that one of each of these
          four double texts embodies the revision of Jerome. (The chief
          collection of Old Latin texts is P. Sabatier, Bibliorum sacrorum
          latine versiones antiquoe, 3 vols., Paris, 1751; cf. also S.
          Berger, Notices et extraits des manuscrits de la Bibliothèque
          Nationale et autres bibliothèques, Paris, 1893, xxxiv, 2, pp.

          vol. ii, pp. 205-243.)

2. Syriac:

  2. The Peshito and Hexaplar Syriac Versions.

          Here also distinction must be made between the common Syriac
          (Peshito) and the Hexaplar Syriac version. The former was
          printed by Walton in the London Polyglot, and, from examination
          of six manuscripts in the British Museum, by P. de Lagarde
          (Libri Veteris Testamenti apocrypha Syriace, Leipsic, 1861). The
          most important manuscript is the Codex Ambrosianus B. 21 Inf. of
          the sixth century, which contains the whole of the Old Testament
          and the following Apocrypha: Wisdom, Epistle of Jeremiah, I and
          II Epistles of Baruch, additions to Daniel, Judith,
          Ecelesiasticus, Apocalypse of Baruch, IV Ezra, I-V Maccabees (V
          Maccabees=Josephus, War, vi). Only Ezra and Tobit are wanting.
          The character of this Syriac translation is different in the
          different books, some being quite literal and faithful, others
          free and inaccurate. The Hexaplar Syriac is the Syriac
          translation prepared after the text of Origen's Hexapla, and is
          for the most part extant in manuscripts at Milan, Paris, and
          London. The most important manuscript is the Codex Ambrosianus
          C. 313 Inf. It contains Wisdom, Ecclesiasticus, Baruch, Epistle
          of Jeremiah, and the additions to Daniel. To the Hexaplar
          translation belongs also the Syriac text of Tobit i-xii. The
          rest of the book is from the Peshito.

              IV. Origin and Contents of the Individual Writings.

1. The Apocryphal Ezra

          (I Esdras; for II Esdras see [474]Pseudepigrapha, Old Testament,
          II, 7): In the Greek Bibles this book is called II Ezra; in the
          Latin, III Ezra (Nehemiah = II Ezra). The whole is a worthless
          compilation, the main part of which is identical with the
          canonical Ezra. The mutual relations may be seen from the
          following:

          Chap. i = II Chron. xxxv-xxxvi: The restoration of the temple
          worship under Josiah (639-609 b.c.), and the history of Josiah's
          successors till the destruction of the Temple (588). Chap. ii,
          1-14 = Ezra i: Cyrus in the first year of his reign (537 b.c.)
          allows the exiles to return, and restores to them the vessels of
          the Temple. Chap. ii, 15-25= Ezra iv, 7-24: In consequence of an
          accusation against the Jews, Artaxerxes (465-425 b.c.) forbids
          the continuation of the building of the Temple and the walls of
          Jerusalem. Chap. iii-v, 6, independent: Zerubbabel obtains the
          favor of Darius (521-485 b.c.), and secures permission to lead
          the exiles back. Chap. v, 7-70 = Ezra ii, 1-iv, 5: List of those
          who returned with Zerubbabel, the activities of Zerubbabel, and
          the interruption of the building of the Temple during the time
          of Cyrus (536-529 b.c.) and till the second year of Darius (520
          b.c.). Chap. vi-vii = Ezra v-vi: Resumption and completion of
          the building of the Temple in the sixth year of Darius (516
          b.c.). Chap. viii-ix, 36 Ezra vii-x: Ezra returns with a caravan
          of exiles in the seventh year of Artaxerxes (458 b.c.); the
          beginning of Ezra' s activities. Chap. ix, 37-55 = Neh. vii,
          73-viii, 13: Ezra proclaims the Law.

          The apocryphal differs from the canonical Ezra in the following
          four points: (1) The passage iv, 7-24 of the canonical Ezra is
          placed first; (2) the passage iii-v, 6 of the apocryphal Ezra is
          inserted from an unknown source; (3) II Chron. xxxv-xxxvi serves
          as a preface; (4) Neh. vii, 73-viii, 13 is added at the end. In
          the canonical Ezra, iv, 6-23 is in the wrong place; it belongs
          to a later period and treats not of the interruption of the
          building of the Temple but of the interruption of the building
          of the walls. The redactor of the apocryphal Ezra has indeed
          taken it out of its wrong surroundings, but he has increased the
          confusion by locating the passage wrongly and by adding as
          supplement the account of the interruption of work on the
          Temple. Not satisfied with this he inserted also the piece
          iii-v, 6, which transfers the action into the time of Darius,
          whereas in v, 7-70 events in the reign of Cyrus are discussed.
          Thus the history goes backward; first (ii, 15-25) Artaxerxes,
          then (iii-v, 6) Darius, finally (v, 7-70) Cyrus. And in the last
          passage it is told very ingenuously how Zerubbabel had already
          returned with the exiles under Cyrus (cf. v, 8, 67-70), after
          the statement has been made expressly that Zerubbabel through a
          special favor of Darius obtained permission to return. The
          opinion of Howorth that the apocryphal Ezra is more original
          than the canonical is a reversal of the actual state of the
          case, as is sufficiently shown by Kosters. Concerning the
          sources used by the compiler two facts appear: (a) The canonical
          Ezra which he used was not that of the Septuagint, but was the
          Hebrew-Aramaic original (cf. Nestle, Marginalien und
          Materialien, Tübingen, 1893, pp. 23-29); (b) the portion iii-v,
          6 he certainly found ready to hand, since it stands in the
          directest opposition to the rest of the narrative. It seems to
          be from a Greek original, not a translation from the Hebrew. The
          purpose of the entire compilation was correctly stated by
          Bertholdt (Historisch-kritische Einleitung in die Bücher des
          Alten Testaments, 6 vols., Erlangen, 1812-19, iii, 1011) in the
          following words: "He intended to compile from older works a
          history of the Temple from the last epoch of the legal worship
          to its rebuilding and of the reestablishment of the prescribed
          divine service." The compiler evidently purposed to quote
          further from Nehemiah; for the abrupt close can not possibly
          have been intended. As to the date of compilation all that can
          be said is that the book was used by Josephus (Ant., xi, 1-5).

2. Additions to Esther

          (The Rest of Esther): The Book of Esther narrates how Esther,
          the foster-daughter of a Jew named Mordecai at the court of King
          Ahasuerus (Xerxes) in Shushan, becomes the wife of the king; how
          Haman, the prime minister who intended to destroy Mordecai and
          all Jews, is himself brought to the gallows; and how by her
          intercession Esther finally induces the king to revoke the edict
          issued under Haman's influence, and thus saves her people. Into
          this narrative the following pieces are inserted in the Greek
          Bible: (a) Before i, 1, Mordecai's dream of the miraculous
          deliverance of his people; (b) after iii, 13, the text of the
          first edict of Artaxerxes (thus the king is named in this
          section) which decrees the extermination of the Jews; (c) after
          iv, 17, the text of the prayers of Mordecai and Esther for the
          salvation of their people; (d) in place of v, 1-2, the reception
          of Esther by the king; (e) in place of viii, 13, the text of the
          second edict of Artaxerxes, which recalls the first; (f) after
          x, 3, Mordecai perceives the significance of his dream. It is
          difficult to decide whether these pieces were interpolated by
          the translator of the Septuagint version of Esther or by a later
          hand. There is no reason for assuming for them a Hebrew
          original. It is true that Hebrew and Aramaic texts exist, but
          they are late in origin, and most likely were made directly or
          indirectly from the Greek, as were other Hebrew and Aramaic
          texts of the Apocrypha. For these additions Josephus is the
          oldest witness (Ant., VI, vi, 6 sqq.), since the annotation to
          Esther according to which Dositheus and his son Ptolemy brought
          the book (to Egypt) in the fourth year of the reign of King
          Ptolemy and Cleopatra, refers to the book as a whole and can not
          be used as testimony for the antiquity of the interpolated
          passages. Moreover, this testimony is very indecisive, since
          there were no less than four Ptolemies, each of whom had a wife
          named Cleopatra. In this book, especially interesting is the
          text-recension which is extant in Codices 19, 93A, 108B, the
          latter two containing both texts, the common and the revised.
          The revision of the common text, which on the whole
          characterizes the readings of these manuscripts, is more radical
          in Esther than is usual, on which account Fritzsche published
          both texts side by side in his edition of 1848 as well as in his
          collection of the Apocrypha. Lagarde did the same in his edition
          of the Septuagint (i, 1883).

3. Additions to Daniel:

  (a) The Song of the Three Children:

          In the third chapter of Daniel it is told how the three children
          Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego (or, as their Hebrew names are
          given in i, 7, Hananiah, Mishael, and Azariah), refusing to fall
          down before the image of the king, were punished by being thrown
          into the furnace, but were miraculously saved. In the Greek text
          of Daniel an insertion is made after iii, 23, in which it is
          told that Azariah when in the furnace prayed to God to be saved,
          and when his prayer was heard, that the three sang a song of
          praise, the text of the prayer as well as of the song being
          given.

  (b) The History of Susanna:

          In the Greek text this passage generally stands at the beginning
          of Daniel, and Daniel is introduced as still a boy. Susanna, the
          wife of a prominent Jew of Babylon, named Joacim, is wrongly
          accused of adultery, and condemned to death, but is saved by the
          young Daniel's wisdom and prophetic gift.

  (c) Bel and the Dragon:

          Daniel proves to the king of Babylon (whom Theodotion calls
          Cyrus) that the god Bel neither eats nor drinks the offerings
          put before him. The destruction of a dragon, which is an object
          of worship, Daniel brings about by feeding it with indigestible
          cakes. Being cast into the lion's den at the instigation of the
          enraged populace, Daniel is not touched by the lion, and is
          miraculously fed by the prophet Habakkuk.

          Of these three insertions the first only is a proper supplement
          to the canonical book of Daniel. The other two are independent
          and probably originated independently. There is no certain
          reason for assuming that either of the three insertions was
          originally written in Hebrew or Aramaic. The history of Susanna
          is certainly a Greek original, as was inferred by Julius
          Africanus and Porphyry from plays on words possible only in
          Greek (cf. Bertholdt, Einleitung, iv, 1575 sqq.; a thorough but
          nevertheless abortive effort to put aside the force of these
          plays was made by Wiederholt in TQ, 1869, pp. 290-321). Of the
          Song of the Three Children in the furnace and the story of the
          dragon, Gaster published an Aramaic text from a Jewish chronicle
          of the Middle Ages, which he regards as the original (Gaster,
          The Unknown Aramaic Original of Theodotion's Additions to the
          Book of Daniel, in PSBA, xvi, 1894, pp. 280-290, 312-317; xvii,
          1895, pp. 75-94). But the author of the chronicle says that he
          gives the insertions, "which Thodos found; and this is the
          section which was inserted into his text by Thodos, the wise
          man, who translated in the days of Commodus, King of the Romans"
          (PSBA, xvi, 283, 312). Since Symmachus and Aquila are also
          mentioned as Bible translators, Thodos is no doubt Theodotion,
          as Gaster also states. The chronicler himself thus declares that
          the insertions are later than Theodotion. Still less originality
          can be claimed by another Aramaic (Syriac) reproduction of the
          story of the dragon, which Raymundus Martini quoted in his Pugio
          fidei, and which was published by Neubauer (The Book of Tobit,
          London, 1878, pp. xci-xcii, 39-43); the same can also be said of
          the Hebrew recension of the History of Susanna in Jellinek, Bet
          ha-Midrash (6 vols., Vienna, 1877, vi, 126-128). On account of
          the linguistic agreement of the insertions with the translation
          of the rest of the book, Fritzsche is led to the assumption that
          they are united with the book by the translator [of the
          Septuagint], and were recast by him (Exegetisches Handbuch, i,
          114). This is improbable if the Greek origin of the insertions
          is maintained. Before the Daniel legend could produce new
          formations in the Greek language, a Greek book of Daniel had to
          exist. On the History of Susanna there is an interesting
          correspondence between Julius Africanus and Origen, in which the
          former denies the genuineness of the story and the latter
          defends it (Julii Africani de historia Susannoe epistola ad
          Origenem et Origenis ad illum responsio, ed. J. R. Wetstenius,
          Basel, 1674, Eng. transl., ANF, iv, 385-392). The text of the
          Septuagint of the Book of Daniel, together with its additions,
          was early displaced from ecclesiastical use by the version of
          Theodotion; consequently all manuscripts and editions of the
          Septuagint contain Theodotion's version of Daniel. The text of
          the Septuagint is extant in only one manuscript, which is in the
          library of Prince Chigi at Rome (Codex Chisianus, no. 88 in
          Holmes's Vetus Testamentum; Tischendorf dates it in the eleventh
          century), and was first edited by Simon de Magistris (Daniel
          secundum LXX ex tetraplis Origenis nunc primum editus e
          singulari Chisiano codice, Rome, 1772). A correct reprint of the
          Codex Chisianus was first published by Cozza (Sacrorum bibliorum
          vetustissima fragmenta Groeca et Latina, part iii, Rome, 1877),
          and after him by Swete (The Old Testament in Greek, iii,
          Cambridge, 1894). Wherever Theodotion could not revise after a
          Hebrew original, his text in the additions is nothing but a
          revision of the Septuagint. The text of the Septuagint is the
          basis of the Hexaplar-Syriac version.

4. The Prayer of Manasses:

          After King Manasseh had been taken to Babylon by the Assyrians,
          and while in captivity, he repented and besought God to be
          delivered; God heard his prayer and brought him back again to
          Jerusalem (II Chron. xxxiii, 11-13). According to II Chron.
          xxxiii, 18-19, this prayer was written in the "Book of the Kings
          of Israel" and in the "History of Hozai" and "among the sayings
          of the seers." This reference suggested the composition of a
          prayer which should correspond to the situation. It is found in
          some manuscripts of the Septuagint (e.g., Codex Alexandrinus)
          among the hymns given at the head of the Psalms; and is also
          quoted in full in the Apostolic Constitutions, ii, 22. The
          latter furnishes the earliest trace of the existence of the
          prayer; it may be, as Nestle supposes, that it was transferred
          from this passage into the manuscripts of the Septuagint. It is
          nowhere found in the text of Chronicles. The Latin translation
          in the Vulgate (since the Council of Trent put into the
          appendix) is entirely different from the Old Latin, and is of
          very late origin.

5. Baruch:

          Under the name of Baruch, the faithful friend and companion of
          the prophet Jeremiah, whose prophecies he wrote down (Jer.
          xxxvi, 4, 17 sqq., 27, 32; xlv, 1) and with whom he shared the
          involuntary abode in Egypt (Jer. xliii, 5-7), a work is extant
          which consists of the following three parts, rather loosely
          connected: (a) i, 2-iii, 8: In the fifth year after the
          destruction of Jerusalem by the Chaldeans (586 b.c.), the Jews
          in Babylon send messages to Jerusalem to the high priest
          Joiakim, forward money to provide sacrifices for the Temple, and
          ask prayers for the life of King Nebuchadnezzar and his son
          Belshazzar. In the letter which the messengers bring to
          Jerusalem the point is especially emphasized that the present
          misfortune is but a punishment for the people's sin and their
          disobedience to God's commandments, especially because they did
          not obey the king of Babylon, as God desired them; (b) iii,
          9-iv, 4: Israel is exhorted to return to the source of all
          wisdom, who is God alone; (c) iv, 5-v, 9: The discouraged people
          are exhorted to take heart. Though Jerusalem is devastated and
          the people scattered, God will bring them back into the holy
          city.

          Opinions differ much as to the date of composition. It is the
          more difficult to decide because the three pieces of which the
          work is composed are of different character and come from at
          least two, possibly three, authors. The position of Roman
          Catholic theologians that the book really belongs to Baruch is
          untenable. The author was unacquainted with the circumstances of
          the times (cf. Fritzsche, Exegetisches Handbuch, i, 170), and
          was in the dark as to the situation invented by himself, not
          having pictured it clearly to his own consciousness. On the one
          hand, he presupposed the destruction of the city by the
          Chaldeans (i, 2), yet spoke as if the ritual and the Temple
          itself still existed (i, 10, 14). Even Ewald's view, that the
          book originated in the latter Persian and first Greek period, is
          far from the truth. There are parallels with the Book of Daniel
          which make certain literary dependence of one upon the other.
          Daniel ix, 7-10 corresponds almost literally to Baruch i, 15-18.
          But it is hardly conceivable that such a very original and
          creative mind as the author of Daniel copied from Baruch. This
          brings the book down into the later Maccabean times, on account
          of the necessary interval between Baruch and Daniel. With this
          date most of the Protestant critics seem to be satisfied (so
          Fritzsche, Exegetisches Handbuch, i, 173, and De Wette-Schrader,
          Einleitung, p. 603). But it is very questionable whether this is
          correct, whether, with Hitzig (ZWT, 1860, pp. 262 sqq.) and
          Kneucker (Das Buch Baruch, Leipsic,1879), the date should not be
          brought down to the time of Vespasian.

          Mention should be made of the fact, first noted by P. E. E.
          Geiger (Der Psalter Salomos, Augsburg, 1871, p. 137), that
          Baruch v has the same viewpoint as the Psalter of Solomon xi.
          The thoughts are in part derived from Isaiah. A literary
          relationship between Pseudo-Solomon and Pseudo-Baruch can hardly
          be denied. Considering the psalmlike character of Baruch, it
          seems more appropriate to grant priority to the psalms than to
          Baruch. This would lead at least into the time of Pompey, in
          which the psalms originated (cf. Schürer, Geschichte, iii, 150
          sqq.). Besides, the first as well as the third part of the book
          presupposes the destruction of Jerusalem and of the Temple, the
          devastation and ruin of the country, and the removal of the
          inhabitants into captivity (i, 2; ii, 23, 26; iv, 10-16). To be
          sure, according to the author's plan, the action is placed in
          the time of the Chaldeans; but the whole work, with all its
          exhortations and consolations, suits a similar situation, and is
          not sufficiently motived, unless the contemporaries of the
          author lived under the pressure of like conditions (cf.
          Fritzsche, Exegetisches Handbuch, i, 172 sqq.). Circumstances
          similar to those of the time of the Chaldeans existed again in
          consequence of the great war of 66-70 a.d. Such a destruction of
          city and Temple took place neither in the time of the Maccabeans
          nor in the time of Pompey (to which Graetz assigns the book).
          Finally, some striking peculiarities suggest the war from 66 to
          70. The author considers the misfortune of Israel a punishment
          for its rebellion against the king of Babylon, and exhorts the
          people to offer sacrifice and prayer to Nebuchadnezzar and
          Belshazzar (ii, 21 sqq., i, 10 sqq.). In like manner Josephus
          (War, II, xvii, 2-4) saw the real cause of the war in the
          abolition of the sacrifice for the Roman emperor. The entire
          unhistorical juxtaposition of Nebuchadnezzar and Belshazzar
          suggests Vespasian and Titus. That parents might eat the flesh
          of their children during a famine (ii, 3) was already threatened
          (Lev. xxvi, 29; Deut. xxviii, 53; Jer. xix, 9; Ezek. v, 10), and
          is stated as a fact (II Kings vi, 28 sqq.; Lam. ii, 20, iv, 10).
          It may be recalled that the very same thing is also narrated of
          the war under Vespasian (Josephus, War, VI, iii, 4). In view of
          these facts the inference is allowable that the Book of Baruch
          originated in the time of Vespasian. It is first quoted by
          Athenagoras ("Plea for the Christians," ix, where Baruch iii, 35
          is quoted as the utterance of a prophet), and is also quoted by
          Irenæus (Hoer., IV, xx, 4; V, xxxv, 1), and Clement of
          Alexandria (Poedagogus, I, x, 91-92; II, iii, 36).

          The question of the unity of authorship can be treated only in
          connection with the question of the original language. In the
          latter respect Jerome says (Prolegomena in Jer.), "It is neither
          found nor read among the Hebrews." Over against this in the
          Hexaplar-Syriac there occurs three times (in i, 17 and ii, 3)
          the remark "This does not exist in the Hebrew" (cf. Ceriani's
          notes to his edition in the Monumenta sacra et profana, i, 1,
          Milan, 1861-1871). According to this, it maybe assumed that a
          Hebrew Baruch, corresponding to the Greek which has been
          preserved, was known to antiquity; and the linguistic character,
          at least of the first part, confirms this assumption. But the
          diction from iii, 9 is perceptibly different. Accordingly the
          view of Fritzsche has much in its favor; viz., that the first
          part is a translation from the Hebrew; the rest, however, is
          from a Greek original (Exegetisches Handbuch, i, 171 sqq.). With
          this it is also decided that there were two authors; the
          translator of the first part added the rest from his own
          resources, but both are to be dated in the time of Vespasian.
          Finally it is worthy of remark that the use of Theodotion's
          version of Daniel can be shown (cf. L. E. T. André, Les
          Apocryphes de l'Ancien Testament, Paris, 1904, pp. 251 sqq.;
          TLZ, 1904, p. 255). From this it must be inferred that this
          version is much older than is generally supposed.

6. The Epistle of Jeremiah:

          As an addition to the Book of Baruch there is often found the
          so-called Epistle of Jeremiah (occurring as chap. vi in the
          Vulgate, in Luther's Bible, and in the English). Originally it
          had nothing to do with the Book of Baruch, and in older
          manuscripts is separated from it. But without any valid reason
          the two were united at a very early period. The letter is
          addressed to the exiles designated by Nebuchadnezzar to be led
          to Babylon. In contents it is a somewhat diffusive and
          rhetorical exhortation, though in good Greek, against the
          Babylonian deities, together with an ironical description of
          their nothingness. Its genuineness is out of the question; for
          the epistle was certainly originally written in Greek. Besides,
          the duration of the exile (verse 3) is given as lasting seven
          generations in opposition to Jer. xxix, 10. Many find in II
          Macc. ii, 1 sqq. direct reference to this epistle. But what is
          said there has nothing to do with it. Still less can it be
          regarded as a reference to the epistle, when the fact is taken
          into account that in one Targum to Jer. x, 11, this Aramaic
          verse is designated a "copy" from an epistle of Jeremiah (cf.
          Nestle, Marginalien und Materialien, 1893, pp. 42 sqq.).

7. Tobit:

          The name of this book and of its hero is read in the Vulgate
          Tobias; but in the Greek text Tobit (or Tobith), in the English
          translation "Tobit," where "Tobias" is only the name of the son
          of Tobit. According to the Greek text, in the first part of the
          book Tobit himself tells his story, speaking in the first
          person; from iii, 7, the narrator speaks in the third person.
          Tobit, a son of Tobiel of the tribe of Naphtali belonged to the
          exiles who were led away to Nineveh into captivity by the
          Assyrian king Shalmaneser. He lived there also under the kings
          Sennacherib and Esarhaddon and always distinguished himself by
          an exemplary piety. Since in spite of this piety he still
          experienced misfortune, he was derided and ridiculed (i, 1-iii,
          6). A similar experience was that of a pious woman named Sara,
          the daughter of Raguel in Ecbatana (iii, 7-15). Because both
          prayed to God in their distress, the angel Raphael was sent to
          deliver both from the sufferings which befell them in their
          innocence, and to unite Sara and Tobias, the son of Tobit, in
          marriage (iii, 16-xii, 22). Tobit sang a psalm of praise in
          honor of God, and lived to be a hundred and forty-eight, and
          Tobias lived to be a hundred and twenty-seven (xiii, xiv). This
          is the course of the narrative, which is adorned with many
          details, exhibits a good talent for composition, and also
          displays the spirit of the strictly Pharisaic legality. Older
          theology down to the nineteenth century regarded the story as
          history; but the narrative is no doubt pure fiction. Its object
          is obvious; it is to prove that God never forsakes the pious and
          righteous; on the contrary, he always takes care of them, though
          they seem to be forsaken; finally that he richly rewards their
          piety. On this account those who, like Tobit, dwell among the
          Gentiles should not suffer themselves by the hardships of their
          external circumstances to become faithless to God.

          The contents being so general, it is impossible to fix the time
          of composition. But with some probability it may be said that
          the book originated during the last two centuries b.c. There is
          no reason to go down to the post-Vespasian time, as Hitzig does
          (ZWT, 1860, pp. 250 sqq.); for here the case is essentially
          different from that of Baruch. While it is true that from the
          standpoint of the Assyrian times the destruction of Jerusalem
          and, conformably to it, its rebuilding also are prophesied (xiv,
          4-5; xiii, 9-10, 16 sqq.), the entire book is by no means
          intended to comfort the readers for the destruction of
          Jerusalem. It is true that Hitzig infers, from the fact that the
          author depicts the rebuilding of city and Temple with more
          extravagant colors than would apply to the historical building,
          that he did not live while this historical building stood. But a
          careful consideration of the principal passage sets us right.
          Chap. xiv, 5 reads: "And they shall build the house but not like
          to the former, until the times of that age be fulfilled; and
          afterward they shall return from the places of their captivity,
          and build up Jerusalem gloriously, and the house of God shall be
          built in it forever with a glorious building, even as the
          prophets spake concerning it." Here two things are plainly
          distinguished: (a) the historical building of Zerubbabel, which
          is insignificant ("not like to the former"); and (b) the
          beautiful building of eternity, which is to follow this at the
          end of this age, which is still in the future even for the
          author. The very fact that the writer knew nothing of a repeated
          catastrophe between the two would indicate that he lived in
          pre-Vespasian or even in pre-Herodian times. Clear signs of a
          use of the book are lacking till the second century of the
          Christian era. Reference is made in xiv, 10 to the legend of
          Achikar or Achiachar, which is extant in different late
          recensions (cf. Conybeare, Harris, and Lewis, The Story of
          Ahikar from the Syriac, Arabic, Armenian, Greek, and Slavonic
          Versions, London, 1898). No Hebrew (or Aramaic) copy of the book
          was known to Origen and his Jewish advisers (Epist. ad
          Africanum, xiii: "The Jews neither use Tobit nor Judith, nor do
          they have them in Hebrew"). It is therefore probable that the
          extant Semitic texts are late. An Aramaic text was edited by A.
          Neubauer (The Book of Tobit, a Chaldee Text from a Unique MS. in
          the Bodleian Library, Oxford, 1878; cf. G. Bicknell, in ZKT,
          1878, pp. 216-222; T. Nöldeke, in Monatsberichte der Berliner
          Akademie, 1879, pp. 45-69; and G. H. Dalman, Grammatik des
          Jüdisch-palästinischen Aramäisch, Leipsic, 1894, pp. 27-29).
          There exist also two Hebrew compositions generally acknowledged
          to be of late date (cf. C. D. Ilgen, Die Geschichte Tobi's,
          Jena, 1800, cxxxviii sqq., ccxvii sqq.; Fritzsche, Exegetisches
          Handbuch, ii, 5, 9 sqq., xiv; T. Nöldeke, Die Alttestamentliche
          Litteratur, Leipsic, 1868, pp. 108 sqq.). The Aramaic text has
          this in common with the Latin revision of Jerome (and with this
          only), that the story of Tobit is narrated from the beginning in
          the third person, whereas in all other texts, in i, 1-iii, 6,
          Tobit speaks in the first person. The Aramaic text is thus
          perhaps identical with, or at any rate nearly related to, that
          used by Jerome. Dalman for linguistic reasons declares it to be
          later. But a decision is difficult, since Jerome actually leans
          more upon the Old Latin. Since the uniform adoption of the third
          person is evidently secondary, the originality of the Aramaic as
          against the Greek is out of the question. It is probable that in
          the Aramaic text also the first person in chap. i, 1-iii, 6 was
          originally preserved; for it is still used in the so-called
          Hebroeus Munsteri, which, according to other indications, was
          made from the Aramaic. But even with this supposition there is
          no reason to assume an Aramaic text as the original of the Greek
          (so Fuller in Wace's Apocrypha, i, 152-155, 164-171). The style
          of the Greek text makes its originality rather probable. Of the
          Greek text there are three recensions: (a) the common text
          contained also in the Vatican and Alexandrian manuscripts and
          followed by the Syriac version to vii, 9; (b) that preserved in
          the Sinaitic codex upon which the Old Latin leans for the most
          part; (c) the text of codices 44, 106, 107, which are the basis
          of the Syriac from vii, 10. The manuscripts named represent in
          the beginning the common recension, so that this text is
          preserved only for vi, 9-xiii, 8. In his edition of the
          Apocrypha, Fritzsche gives all three texts. Swete gives the text
          of the Vatican and Sinaitic.

8. Judith:

          The contents of this book are briefly as follows:
          Nebuchadnezzar, king of Assyria (sic), overcomes Arphaxad, king
          of Media, and sends his general, Holofernes, against the Western
          nations which did not take the field with him against Arphaxad.
          They are subdued, and their places of worship destroyed (i-iii).
          Holofernes now attacks the Jewish people, who had recently
          returned from the captivity and rededicated their temple. In the
          face of the imminent danger of having their sanctuary profaned,
          the whole people are bent upon resistance to the utmost, and the
          high priest Joiakim makes the necessary arrangements. Holofernes
          directs his main attack upon the fortress Bethulia, which he
          hopes to conquer by famine (iv-vii). The distress having become
          very great, a beautiful widow, Judith by name, offers to become
          the savior of her people. Having been admitted to the hostile
          camp, she contrives to gain the confidence of Holofernes. While
          Holofernes lies in a drunken stupor, Judith kills him and then
          hastens back into the city. The Jews make a sally, put the enemy
          to flight, and all Israel is saved (viii-xiv). Judith is praised
          as the savior of the people, and at her death at the advanced
          age of 105 years is greatly lamented by all the nation (xv-xvi).

          As is the case in the Book of Tobit, so here there can be no
          doubt that the contents is not history but a didactic narrative.
          The historical details are so incredibly confused, and the
          parenetic object is so manifest, that only by wilfully closing
          the eyes can one fail to see that the book is fiction. What the
          parenetic object is, is plain enough: The Jewish people was to
          be encouraged to fight with the sword boldly and resolutely, for
          the continuance of its faith and worship, even against a
          superior enemy. This points clearly to Maccabean times. It may
          be admitted that the presupposed historical background would fit
          well the time of Artaxerxes Ochus, for this king in one of his
          campaigns against Phenicia and Egypt (c. 350 B.C.) made
          prisoners among the Jews; and Holofernes of Cappadocia and the
          eunuch Bagoes were the most prominent generals in these
          campaigns. Since, in the history of Judith, both Holofernes and
          the eunuch Bagoes play parts (xii, 11 sqq., xiii,1 sqq., xiv,
          14), it seems easy to locate the Judith story in the time of
          Ochus.

          But the author mentions also Nebuchadnezzar. All that can be
          said is that in his literary license the author took a part of
          his material from events in the time of Ochus (T. Nöldeke, Die
          alttestamentliche Litteratur, Leipsic, 1868, p. 96; and Aufsätze
          zur persischen Geschichte, Leipsic, 1887, p. 78). But he
          certainly wrote later. And, since the story deals with a time of
          religious oppression, Maccabean times are indicated as the date
          of composition (cf. Fritzsche, Ewald, Hilgenfeld, and Nöldeke).
          Volkmar, Hitzig, and Graetz date it in the time of Trajan.
          Volkmar especially has vainly expended much learning and fancy
          to prove that the history of the campaigns of Nebuchadnezzar and
          Holofernes is merely a disguised representation of the campaigns
          of Trajan and his generals against the Parthians and the Jews.
          The fact that Clement of Rome (lv) mentions Judith forbids this
          late dating. It is generally agreed that the Greek text is a
          translation of a Hebrew original, as is evident from the entire
          coloring of the language and from mistakes in the translation
          (i, 8; ii, 2; iii, 1, 9, 10; cf. Fritzsche, Exegetisches
          Handbuch, ii, 115 sqq.). The Aramaic recension which Jerome
          perused is not to be regarded as the original, since neither
          Origen nor his Jewish advisers knew of a Hebrew (or Aramaic)
          text (Epist. ad Africanum, xiii, quoted above). It appears that
          the original was lost before Origen's time, and that the Aramaic
          translation used by Jerome originated after that time. The
          extant paraphrastic Hebrew recensions are still later products
          (cf. Zunz, Die gottesdienstlichen Vorträge der Juden, Berlin,
          1832, pp. 124 sqq.; Lipsius, in ZWT, 1867, pp. 337-366; Ball, in
          Wace's Apocrypha, i, 252-257; Gaster, in PSBA, xvi, 1894, pp.
          156-163). Of the Greek text three recensions are extant: (a) the
          common and original one; (b) that of the codices 19, 108; (c)
          that of 58, which was followed by the Syriac and the Old Latin.

9. I Maccabees:

          The name Maccabeus was originally only the surname of Judas, the
          son of Mattathias (I Macc. ii, 4: "Judas who was called
          Maccabeus"). By it Judas was at all events to be characterized
          as a valiant hero. The assured meaning of the name is yet to be
          found. From Judas the name was afterward applied to the whole
          family, even to the whole party of which Judas became leader.
          So, generally, the Maccabeans were the believing Israelites,
          who, in defense of the faith of their fathers, undertook the
          struggle against the Syrian overlords. I Maccabees tells the
          story of these struggles and the history of the independent
          Jewish community which was the fruit of these struggles up to
          the time of the death of the high priest Simon (135 B.C.). It
          commences with the beginning of the reign of Antiochus Epiphanes
          (175 B.C.), narrates how his efforts at a forcible suppression
          of the Jewish religion became the cause of the open revolt
          against Syrian overlordship, describes the changing results of
          this revolt under the leadership of Judas Maccabeus until his
          death (161 B.C.); then the further course of the Maccabean
          efforts under the guidance of Jonathan, brother of Judas, who,
          by adroitly taking advantage of circumstances, was able to
          obtain from the Syrian kings recognition of his status as prince
          and high priest of the Jews (161-143 B.C.); finally the history
          of the high priest Simon, a third brother (143-135 B.C.). The
          narrative is rich in detail and by its unadorned simplicity wins
          a confidence which, so far as Jewish history is concerned, is
          not shaken by the fact that the author shows himself badly
          informed on matters concerning foreign nations, such as the
          Romans. The exaggerated numbers even do not detract from its
          credibility in other things. That a narrative which enters so
          into detail must be based upon other sources is a matter of
          course, though nothing more definite can be stated concerning
          the character of the sources. A reference to these seems to be
          indicated in ix, 22 (cf. Grimm, in Fritzsche, Exegetisches
          Handbuch, iii, 22 sqq.). The book compares to good advantage
          with other historical books in that it fixes all important
          events according to an established chronology, the Seleucidan
          era, which begins in the autumn of 312 B.C. But I Maccabees
          apparently makes the era begin in the spring of that year. The
          time of composition can be fixed with great probability within
          very narrow limits. On the one hand the author knew a chronicle
          of the acts of John Hyrcanus (135-105 B.C.; cf. xvi, 24). From
          this can be inferred that he wrote after John's reign. On the
          other hand, he certainly wrote before the expedition of Pompey,
          since the Romans were for him friends and protectors of the
          Jewish people. The composition belongs therefore to an early
          decade of the first pre-Christian century. That the book was
          originally written in Hebrew is evident from its linguistic
          character, a conclusion confirmed by the testimony of Origen and
          Jerome; the former (in Eusebius, Hist. eccl., VI, xxv, 3) gives
          the Hebrew title of the book, the meaning of which, on account
          of the uncertainty of the text-tradition, is difficult to
          ascertain. Jerome says in the Prologus galeatus: "I Maccabees I
          found in Hebrew; II Maccabees is Greek, as can be proved from
          the very language." The Greek translation was used by Josephus
          (cf. Grimm, in Fritzsche, Exegetisches Handbuch, p. 28; H.
          Bloch, Die Quellen des Flavius Josephus, Leipsic, 1879, pp.
          80-90). It is strange that Josephus knows hardly anything of
          chaps. xiv-xvi. J. von Destinon (Die Quellen des Flavius
          Josephus, Kiel, 1882, pp. 60-91) supposed therefore that the
          book originally did not have these chapters and that the first
          copy differed also in other respects from the present. But the
          very free use made by Josephus offers no sufficient support for
          this theory. A Hebrew recension which A. Schweizer
          (Untersuchungen über die Reste eines hebräischen Textes vom
          ersten Makkabäerbuch, Berlin, 1901) considers original was made
          in the Middle Ages from the Latin (cf. TLZ, 1901, p. 605; REJ,
          xliii, 1901, pp. 215-221).

10. II Maccabees:

          This book is parallel with I Maccabees except that it begins a
          little earlier; viz., with the last year of Seleucus IV,
          Philopator, brother and predecessor of Antiochus Epiphanes, and
          closes much earlier; viz., with the victory of Judas Maccabeus
          over Nicanor (161 B.C.). It therefore covers a much shorter
          period than the first. In its literary, historical, and
          religious character it differs much from I Maccabees. It is more
          rhetorical, and its language and style prove that it was
          originally produced in Greek. In credibility it stands far below
          I Maccabees. It narrates in part the same events, in part
          different events, and in a different order. On the whole, in
          cases of conflict between the two, it is better to follow I
          Maccabees, though it may be admitted that in some details the
          second may here and there follow a better tradition. The means
          by which to decide with certainty in every case no longer exist;
          and the second book deserves a less degree of confidence,
          because its purpose is by no means exclusively historical. The
          author's interest was evidently more narrowly religious than
          that of the first. His immediate object was not to narrate the
          deeds of a glorious past, but to influence the present
          religiously.

          Of the sources, the author himself says (ii, 19 sqq.) that his
          book is only an epitome of the large work of Jason of Cyrene,
          which in five books narrated the history of the Maccabean
          struggles in the times of Antiochus Epiphanes and his son
          Antiochus Eupator. Unfortunately, this Jason of Cyrene is
          otherwise wholly unknown. This much can be said of the time of
          the epitomist with some certainty, that he wrote before the
          destruction of Jerusalem, as may be inferred from the purpose of
          the book and also from xv, 37. Josephus seems to have read
          neither the work of Jason nor that of the epitomist. It is
          possible that the description of the tyrants who persecuted the
          pious and virtuous, given in Philo, Quod omnis probus liber,
          xiii, depends upon II Maccabees (so P. E. Lucius, Der
          Essenismus, Strasburg, 1881, pp. 36-39). Heb. xi, 35 sqq. seems
          to refer to II Macc. vi and vii. The first express quotation is
          found in Clement of Alexandria (Strom., V, xiv, ANF, ii, 467):
          "Aristobulus, who is mentioned by the composer of the epitome of
          the books of the Maccabees" (cf. II Macc. i, 10).

11. III Maccabees:

          If II Maccabees falls short of credibility when compared with
          the first, the third can lay still less claim to the character
          of a historical document. It has the name "Book of the
          Maccabees" very improperly and only because it treats also of
          the oppression and deliverance of believing Israelites. It has
          nothing to do with the time of the Maccabees. The contents are
          as follows: Ptolemy IV, Philopator (222-205 B.C.) visits the
          temple at Jerusalem after his victory over Antiochus the Great
          at Raphia (217 B.C.). Being seized with a desire to penetrate
          into the Holy of Holies, and not heeding the entreaties of the
          people to forego his outrageous purpose, the king is punished
          when about to carry out his design by falling paralyzed to the
          ground. Enraged at this, on his arrival in Egypt, he wreaks his
          vengeance on the Alexandrian Jews. But all his decrees are
          frustrated by God's miraculous intervention. The king now
          becomes a friend and benefactor of the Jews, whom he permits to
          kill the apostates, a privilege of which they make much use.

          The style in which this narrative is written corresponds closely
          to the insipidity of the contents. The book is more bombastic
          and unnatural than II Maccabees. Since the narrative evinces its
          unhistorical character, it is necessary only to inquire what
          facts possibly form the basis of or induced its composition. To
          begin with, it is to be remembered here that Josephus transfers
          the story of the confinement of Jews in the Hippodrome to be
          trodden down by elephants to the reign of Ptolemy VII, Physcon
          (Apion ii, 5); like III Maccabees (vi, 36), he remarks that in
          remembrance of the deliverance experienced, the Alexandrian Jews
          annually celebrated a festival. According to this the narrative
          seems to have some historical foundation; and as concerns the
          chronology, Josephus is to be followed rather than III
          Maccabees. At all events this work is a late production. The
          author knows the Apocryphal additions to Daniel (cf. vi, 6). The
          book is mentioned by Eusebius (Chron., ed. Schöne, ii, 122 sqq.)
          in the Canones Apostolorum (lxxxv), by Theodoret, and others
          (Grimm, in Fritzsche, Exegetisches Handbuch, p. 21). The abrupt
          beginning shows the book has not come down complete.

12. Jesus Sirach (Ecclesiasticus):

          The Book of Proverbs by Jesus the son of Sirach is the
          extra-canonical double of the canonical Book of Proverbs. Like
          that, it gives the results of practical wisdom in poetical form.
          It comprises the whole range of human life in all directions and
          relations, and aims at giving the correct point of view for all
          human enterprises so they may be correct as concerns conduct.
          The highest as well as the lowest, the greatest as well as the
          smallest, are brought within the sphere of the author's
          reflections and counsels. He speaks of the fear of God and of
          divine wisdom, of friendship and mercy, of self-control and
          moderation, and of other virtues; he speaks also of the contrary
          vices. He speaks of the special tasks which differences in age,
          sex, calling, and in civic and social position make obligatory
          upon the individual. He speaks of the mutual relations between
          parents and children, masters and servants, high and low, rich
          and poor. He gives maxims of prudence for social intercourse and
          political behavior. The form in which he clothes his thoughts is
          throughout that of Hebrew poetry. No plan for the book is
          discernible. The writer arranges his ideas in groups, but these
          groups are not arranged with reference to any scheme. The
          morality which runs through the whole is indeed somewhat homely,
          sometimes purely utilitarian. But on the whole there is a solid,
          seriously moral disposition expressed in the book, combined with
          a rational and practical contemplation of the world. What the
          author offers is the ripe fruit of a many-sided education and of
          a long experience.

          The extant Greek text is, as may be seen from the preface, only
          a translation. Jerome asserts that he had seen a Hebrew exemplar
          (cf. the Preface to his translation of the Solomonic books, ed.
          Vallarsi, ix, 1293 sqq.): "There is a right praiseworthy book of
          Jesus the son of Sirach and a pseudepigraphical one which is
          called the Wisdom of Solomon. The first I found in the Hebrew
          called Proverbs,' and not Ecclesiasticus,' as among the Latins,
          to which are added Ecclesiastes and Song of Songs; so that they
          agreed with the books of Solomon not only in number, but also in
          the kind of matter."

          Prior to 1896, only a few sayings of the Hebrew original, which
          are quoted in Rabbinic literature, were known (collected by
          Schechter in JQR, iii, 1891, pp. 682-706; still more completely
          by Cowley and Neubauer, The Original Hebrew of a Portion of
          Ecclesiasticus, London, 1897, pp. xix-xxviii). Since 1896 large
          portions of the Hebrew text have been discovered. They all come
          from the genizah ("lumber-room") of the ancient synagogue at
          Cairo. The fragments are remains of four different manuscripts,
          and supplement each other in such a way that, on the whole,
          two-thirds of the Hebrew text has been recovered. Of the flood
          of literature which these finds have induced the principal
          text-publications are mentioned below (especially important are
          The Book of Ecclesiasticus in Hebrew, London, 1901, a facsimile
          of all the leaves; the condensed work of N. Peters, Der jüngst
          wiederaufgefundene hebräische Text des Buches Ecclesiasticus,
          Freiburg, 1902; and R. Smend, Die Weisheit des Jesus Sirach
          erklärt, 1906, and Die Weisheit des Jesus Sirach hebräisch und
          deutsch herausgegeben, 1906). The denial of the originality of
          the Hebrew text by Margoliouth, Bickell, and formerly also by
          Levi, must be called an aberration. Almost all competent
          scholars regard this as beyond doubt. Besides the Greek versions
          and the Hebrew fragments, there is still another witness, the
          Syriac translation. This was not made from the Greek, like the
          other Syriac texts of the Apocrypha, but directly from the
          Hebrew. From the passage quoted above from Jerome, it is seen
          that the book was called "Proverbs" in the Hebrew. In Greek
          manuscripts the standing title is "The Wisdom of Jesus the Son
          of Sirach." In the Latin Church the title Ecclesiasticus has
          become customary since the time of Cyprian.

          The author calls himself "Jesus the Son of Sirach the
          Jerusalemite" (l, 27). The preface of his grandson, the
          translator, gives his date. He says of himself that he came into
          Egypt "in the thirty-eighth year of King Euergetes." This can
          not mean the translator's thirty-eighth year of life, but the
          thirty-eighth year of the reign of Euergetes. Of the two
          Ptolemies who had the name "Euergetes" the first ruled only
          twenty-five years. Consequently, only the second, whose full
          name was Ptolemæus VII, Physcon Euergetes II, can be meant. He
          ruled conjointly with his brother from 170 B.C. and was sole
          king from 145 B.C. But his regnal years were reckoned from the
          former date. According to this, the thirty-eighth year in which
          the grandson of Jesus Sirach came into Egypt was 132 B.C. The
          grandfather, the author of the book, may have lived and written
          about 190-170 B.C. It is singular that in the Latin Church the
          book has usually been regarded as a work of Solomon, on which
          account some Western canonical lists reckon five Solomonic
          writings (T. Zahn, Geschichte des neutestamentlichen Kanons, ii,
          151, 245, 251, 272, 1007 sqq.).

13. The Wisdom of Solomon:

          In some books of the Old Testament, wisdom, that is, the wisdom
          resting in God and coming from him, is praised as the highest
          good, as the source of all perfection and the giver of all
          happiness and blessing (cf. Prov. viii-ix and Job xxviii, 12
          sqq.). In later literature this was a favorite thought, and was
          further developed. It is met with again in Jesus Sirach and in
          the Wisdom of Solomon. The author of this book, who assumes the
          name of Solomon, reproaches his royal colleagues, the Gentile
          rulers (i, 1; vi, 1), with the folly of impiety and especially
          of idolatry. Only the pious and righteous is truly happy; the
          impious falls under divine judgment. Idolatry is the height of
          folly. In opposition to it the author recommends true wisdom,
          using the idea in its fullest possible content. For he
          understands by the word "wisdom" subjective as well as
          objective, human as well as divine. Both have one meaning, and
          are identical in essence. Human wisdom adjusts true knowledge to
          all spheres of life. It instructs man in the ways of God and
          teaches him God's holy will. On this account it is the source of
          all happiness and all true joy to him who gives himself to it.
          It imparts not only honor and glory but also eternal life and
          everlasting salvation. And this it can do only because human
          wisdom is but an emanation from the divine wisdom, or, rather,
          is identical with it. Originally it was joint possessor with God
          of his throne (ix, 4); it was present when God created the world
          (ix, 9); it is most intimately connected with God and initiated
          into God's knowledge (viii, 3-4); it is a breathing of the power
          of God, an effulgence from the glory of the Almighty (vii,
          25-26); its action is identical with God's; it works all things
          (viii, 5), orders all things (viii, 1), and renews all things
          (vii, 27). From these fundamental thoughts the standpoint of the
          author is evident; he was a Jewish philosopher. On the one hand,
          he occupied throughout the standpoint of Old Testament
          revelation; on the other hand, he had acquired also a peculiar
          philosophical culture. He had learned not only from the sages of
          his people, but also from the Hellenes, from Plato and the
          Stoics. He thus belongs to that school, the classical
          representative of which is Philo, which can be designated as a
          marriage of Jewish faith with Greek philosophical culture. With
          this everything is said that can be said of the author of the
          book. The book stands between Jesus Sirach and Philo, and is the
          bridge from the one to the other. As to its date, it can be put
          with some probability between the two, 150-50 B.C. (cf. Grimm,
          in Fritzsche, Exegetisches Handbuch, vi, 32-34), though the
          inference from priority in thought to priority in time is not
          cogent. It is certainly wrong to think, like Weisse and others,
          of a Christian author. Clear traces of an acquaintance with the
          book are found in the New Testament (cf. W. Sanday and A. C.
          Headlam, Commentary on Romans, 1895, pp. 51-52, 267-269). It is
          first quoted in the time of Irenæus (Eusebius, Hist eccl., v,
          26). That the book was originally written in Greek is a matter
          of course, considering its lofty rhetoric, which is somewhat
          artificial and overdone. Jerome says, "The very style betrays
          Greek eloquence."

                          B. New Testament Apocrypha:

          The relation between the canonical and the apocryphal writings
          of the New Testament is quite different from that between the
          same classes of books of the Old Testament. The Old Testament
          Apocrypha aim simply at a continuation of sacred history and
          strive to accomplish their purpose in a legitimate manner though
          without divine authority. The apocryphal writings connected with
          the New Testament, on the contrary, aim to introduce spurious
          sources among the genuine. They are writings which by name and
          contents pretend to be canonical, though the Church, because of
          their dubious origin and contents, has not given them a place in
          the canon. Like the canonical books of the New Testament, they
          may be divided into four classes: I. Gospels; lI. Acts of the
          Apostles; III. Epistles of the Apostles; IV. Apocalypses.

          These writings are of very unequal value. The apocryphal Acts
          seem to have had the most influence in the Church; for they,
          more than the Gospels, were looked upon as "the source and
          mother of all heresy." Of course, not all of these writings were
          composed directly for heretical purposes. Many of them, no
          doubt, had more innocent motives, such as mere "pious fraud."
          But from their first appearance a suspicion of heresy clung to
          them all and contributed much to put the whole literature under
          ban.

          When the canon of the New Testament was fixed and the apocryphal
          books thereby became outlawed, they ceased to be read; and in
          the Middle Ages, even their names were forgotten. Nevertheless,
          although the books themselves were delivered over to contempt
          and oblivion, it was not so with their contents. From their
          fables sprang sacred legends, which were kept alive in the
          Church during the Middle Ages as "ecclesiastical tradition,"
          which was often utilized in the development of its dogma.
          Indeed, numerous dogmas, usages, and traditions hark back to
          these apocryphal writings; and it was consequently of as much
          moment to the Protestant Church to subject this whole literature
          to a thorough investigation as it was to the Roman Church to
          keep the whole matter in convenient obscurity. The careful study
          of these writings in modern times has proved of great value,
          revealing a wealth of material usable for the elucidation of
          archeological and dogmatic problems. Study of them has become a
          distinct department of the theological curriculum.

I. Apocryphal Gospels:

          Of the many apocryphal Gospels (J. A. Fabricius, in his Codex
          apocryphus Novi Testamenti, 2 vols., Hamburg, 1703, reckons over
          fifty), some have come down entire, others only in fragments;
          and of a few only the names are known. The method employed in
          these compositions is always the same, whether the author
          intended simply to collect and arrange what was floating in the
          general tradition or intended to produce a definite dogmatic
          effect. He rarely relied on his own invention; but generally
          elaborated what was hinted at in the canonical Gospels,
          transformed words of Jesus into deeds, described the fulfilment
          of an Old Testament prophecy in a slavishly literal manner, or
          represented Jesus as working marvels closely resembling but
          surpassing Old Testament miracles. The work done, the author
          took care to conceal his own name, and inscribed his book with
          the name of some apostle or disciple, in order to give it
          authority. In the following list those Gospels are first
          mentioned the texts of which have been preserved.

          1. The Protevangelium of James: This was ascribed to James, the
          brother of the Lord; in the index of Gelasius and Hormisdas it
          is called the "Gospel of James the Less [Younger]." It has
          twenty-five chapters, and covers the period from the
          announcement of the birth of Mary to the murder of the
          innocents. It is very old, perhaps of the second century, was
          widely circulated, and shows traces of Ebionitic origin. The
          text is given by Tischendorf (Evangelia Apocrypha, 2d ed.,
          Leipsic, 1876; Eng. transl. by A. Walker, ANF, viii, 361-367),
          also by Conybeare from an Armenian manuscript (AJT, i, 1897, pp.
          424 sqq.).

          2. The Gospel of Pseudo-Matthew, or Book of the Origin of the
          Blessed Mary and the Infancy of the Savior: This begins with the
          announcement of the birth of Mary, and closes with the youth of
          Jesus, and is contained in forty-two chapters. It seems to be of
          Latin origin, and to have been drawn from the Protevangelium of
          James and the Gospel of Thomas (Eng. transl., ANF, viii,
          368-383).

          3. The Gospel of the Nativity of Mary: This contains in ten
          chapters the history of Mary before the birth of Jesus. It
          covers therefore nearly the same ground as the Gospel of
          Pseudo-Matthew, but is a little later in date (Eng. transl.,
          ANF, viii, 384-387).

          4. The History of Joseph the Carpenter: This contains in
          thirty-two chapters a biography of Joseph, and gives an
          elaborate description of his death. It was evidently written in
          glorification of Joseph, and was intended for recital on the day
          of his festival. It probably belongs to the fourth century; and,
          as Joseph was a favorite of the Monophysite Copts, Coptic (and
          not Arabic) was most likely the language of the original (Eng.
          transl., ANF, viii, 388-394).

          5. The Gospel of Thomas: This, next to the Protevangelium of
          James, was the oldest and most popular of the Apocryphal
          Gospels. It was in use as early as the middle of the second
          century, among the Gnostics with whom it originated, especially
          among those who held Docetic views of the person of Christ. It
          is extant in two Greek recensions, in a Latin and in a Syriac
          version; all of which have somewhat expanded titles. The two
          Greek recensions and the Latin version are given by Tischendorf
          (pp. 140-180); English translation of the three by Walker (ANF,
          viii, 395-404).

          6. The Arabic Gospel of the Infancy: This comprises in
          fifty-five chapters the period from the birth of Jesus to his
          twelfth year, and consists mostly of stories dealing with the
          residence in Egypt. The first nine chapters follow very closely
          the Protevangelium of James; the last twenty chapters follow the
          Gospel of Thomas; the part between seems to rest on some
          national tradition, which explains the favor it found among the
          Arabs, as well as the circumstance that several of its details
          were incorporated into the Koran. The whole work has an Oriental
          character, and shows contact with magic and demonology and with
          Zoroastrian ideas. No more definite date for its composition can
          be fixed than that it antedated the Koran. The Arabic text is
          probably a translation from the Syriac; and no manuscript is
          earlier than the thirteenth century. Tischendorf published a
          revised Latin translation; English version by Walker (ANF, viii,
          405-415).

          7. The Gospel of Nicodemus: This consists of two separate works,
          the Deeds [or Acts] of Pilate and The Descent of Christ to the
          Underworld, which were united at an early date, and the whole
          did not receive the title "Gospel of Nicodemus" until after the
          time of Charlemagne. The former of these two works is of some
          importance for the explanation and further elucidation of the
          canonical Gospels (cf. Lipsius, Die Pilatusakten, 2 ed., Kiel,
          1886), while the latter is of very little interest. The former
          contains a detailed account of the trial of Jesus before Pilate,
          and of the action of the Sanhedrin subsequent to his death,
          which was intended to furnish proof of the resurrection and
          ascension. The latter contains an account by two men, Carinus
          and Leucius, who had been raised from the dead. The text of the
          Gospel of Nicodemus is given by J. C. Thilo (Codex apocryphus
          Novi Testamenti, Leipsic, 1832), who furnishes a list of
          translations into English, French, Italian, and German, and by
          Tischendorf; English translation by Walker (ANF, viii, 416-458).

          In most of the manuscripts containing these two works and in
          close connection with them occur other writings; namely: (a) An
          Epistle of Pilate to the emperor, containing a report on the
          resurrection of Christ. (b) An Epistle of Pontius Pilate,
          another letter, in which he excuses the injustice of his
          decision by the impossibility of resisting the prevailing
          excitement. It was widely diffused in early times. (c) The
          Report of Pilate on the trial, execution, death, and
          resurrection of Jesus. (d) The Judgment of Pilate, a report of
          the examination of Pilate before the emperor, his condemnation
          and execution. Others which deserve nothing more than mention of
          their titles are: (e) The Death of Pilate; (f) The Narrative of
          Joseph of Arimathea; (g) The Avenging of the Savior; (h) The
          Reply of Tiberius to Pilate (Eng. transls., ANF, viii, 459-476).

          8-37. Apocryphal Gospels Preserved only in Fragments or Known
          only by Name: Besides the Gospels mentioned above there were
          others, of which there remain only a few fragments or only the
          names: (8) The Gospel according to the Egyptians: Quoted by
          Clement of Rome and Clement of Alexandria, and mentioned by
          Origen, Epiphanius, and Jerome. It was used by the Encratites
          and Sabellians [and composed either at Antioch (Zahn) or in
          Egypt (Harnack) in the middle of the second century]. (9) The
          Eternal Gospel: The work of a Minorite of the thirteenth
          century, based upon Rev. xiv, 6. It was condemned by Pope
          Alexander IV. It is mentioned here solely because of its name
          and is not properly reckoned among the apocryphal Gospels (see
          [475]Joachim of Fiore). (10) The Gospel of Andrew: Perhaps the
          same as the Acts of Andrew (see below [476]II, 6). (11) The
          Gospel of Apelles: Possibly a mutilated version of a canonical
          Gospel like that of Marcion (cf. A. Harnack, De Apellis gnosi
          monarchia, Leipsic, 1874, p. 75). (12) The Gospel of the Twelve
          Apostles: Jerome identified this with what he calls the Gospel
          among the Hebrews. (13) The Gospel of Barnabas. (14) The Gospel
          of Bartholomew: On the tradition that Bartholomew brought the
          Hebrew Gospel of Matthew to India, where it was found by
          Pantænus, cf. Fabricius, i, 341. (15) The Gospel of Basilides.
          (16) The Gospel of Cerinthus: Mentioned by Epiphanius ((Hær.,
          li, 7); perhaps a mutilated version of the Gospel according to
          Matthew, similar to that used by the Carpocratians. (17) The
          Gospel of the Ebionites: Epiphanius ((Hær., xxx, 13, 16, 21) has
          preserved fragments of this Gospel which he says was a mutilated
          Gospel of Matthew called by the Ebionites The Hebrew Gospel. It
          is not identical with the Gospel of the Nazarenes. (18) The
          Gospel of Eve: Mentioned by Epiphanius as in use among certain
          Gnostics (Hær., xxvi, 2, 3, and 5). [Preuschen prints the
          extracts quoted by Epiphanius as a fragment of an Ophite Gospel
          (Antilegomena, Giessen, 1901, p. 80). Jesus is represented as
          saying in a voice of thunder: "I am thou, and thou art I, and
          wherever thou art there am I, and in all things I am sown. And
          from whencesoever thou gatherest me, in gathering me thou
          gatherest thyself." Cf. J. H. Ropes, Die Sprüche Jesu, Leipsic,
          1896, p. 56.] (19) The Gospel according to the Hebrews:
          According to the testimony of Jerome, this book was identical
          with the Gospel of the Twelve Apostles and the Gospel of the
          Nazarenes, and was written in Aramaic in Hebrew characters, used
          among the Nazarenes, and translated by himself into Greek and
          Latin. (20) The Gospel of James the Elder: Said to have been
          discovered in 1595 in Spain, where, according to tradition,
          James labored. (21) John's Account of the Departure of Mary: It
          exists in Greek, in two Latin versions (all three translated
          into English by Walker, ANF, viii, 587-598), also in Syriac,
          Sahidic, and Arabic versions. (22) The Gospel of Judas Iscariot:
          According to Irenæus, Epiphanius, and Theodoret, used among the
          Cainites, a Gnostic sect. (23) The Gospel of Leucius. (24) The
          Gospel of Lucian and Hesychius: Mentioned as forgeries by the
          Decretum Gelasii (VI, xiv, 15). Jerome ("Prologue to the
          Gospels") believes that they were only the first recensions of
          the Gospel text, though he also charges the two men with
          unauthorized tampering with the text. Lucian was a presbyter at
          Antioch; Hesychius was a bishop in Egypt toward the end of the
          third century. (25) The Gospels of the Manicheans: These were
          four in number (a) The Gospel of Thomas, a disciple of Manes
          (this Gospel must be distinguished from the other Gospel of
          Thomas, see [477]5 above); (b) The Living Gospel; (c) The Gospel
          of Philip; (d) The Gospel of Abdas. (26) The Gospel of Marcion:
          [478]Marcion, the founder of the famous anti-Jewish sect known
          as Marcionites, admitted only Pauline writings into his canon.
          He lived in the first half of the second century. The passages
          in which Paul speaks of his Gospel (Rom. ii, 16; Gal. i, 8; II
          Tim. ii, 9) obviously suggested the attribution to him of a
          special Gospel. Marcion regarded the Gospel of Luke as Paul's,
          but he obtained this Gospel only by eliminating from Luke all
          Jewish elements, as is attested by Irenæus, Origen, and
          Tertullian. The latter two quote the corrupted passages. (27)
          The Questions, Greater and Lesser, of Mary: Two works of obscene
          contents, used by some Gnostics, according to Epiphanius (Hær.,
          xxvi, 8). (28) The Apocryphal Gospel of Matthew. (29) The
          Narrative of the Legal Priesthood of Christ. (30) The Gospel of
          Perfection: Used by the Basilidians and other Gnostics, not the
          same as the Gospel of Philip or the Gospel of Eve (cf.
          Fabricius, i, 373; ii, 550). (31) The Gospel of Peter: Mentioned
          by Origen, Eusebius, and Jerome, and used by the congregation at
          Rhossus in Cilicia toward the end of the second century.
          Serapion, bishop of Antioch, found it there (c. 191 A.D.) and
          after examination condemned it (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., vi, 12).
          An important fragment of the Gospel of Peter was discovered in
          1886 in a grave, supposed to be that of a monk, in an ancient
          cemetery at Akhmim, the ancient Panopolis in Upper Egypt. It was
          published in 1892 (Memoirs of the French Archeological Mission
          at Cairo, IX, i). The Gospel of Peter was edited by Harnack (2d
          ed., 1893), Zahn (1893), Von Schubert (1893), and Von Gebhardt
          (1893). [For English translation cf. ANF, ix, 7-8. It has been
          the subject of numerous able articles in the theological
          journals since its publication in 1892.] (32) The Gospel of
          Philip: Mentioned and quoted by Epiphanius (Hær., xxvi, 13) as
          being in use among the Gnostics. Possibly it is the same as was
          in use among the Manicheans (see above [479]25, c). (33) The
          Gospel of the Simonites, or, as it was also called by
          themselves, The Book of the Four Corners and Hinges of the
          World: Mentioned in the Arabic Preface to the Council of Nicoea.
          (34) The Gospel according to the Syrians: Possibly identical
          with the Gospel according to the Hebrews. (35) The Gospel of
          Tatian: Mentioned by Epiphanius (Hær., XLVI, i, 47, 4) as being
          used by the Encratites and by Catholic Christians in Syria.
          Being a compilation from the four Gospels, it was called also
          "The Diatessaron"; see [480]Harmony of the Gospels; [481]Tatian.
          (36) The Gospel of Thaddæus: Mentioned in the Gelasian Decree.
          The name may have been intended for that of the apostle Judas
          Thaddæus, or for that of one of the Seventy who, according to
          tradition, was sent to King Abgar of Edessa (see [482]Abgar; and
          cf. Eusebius, Hist. eccl., i, iii). (37) The Gospel of
          Valentinus: Usually identified with the Gospel of Truth on the
          authority of Irenæus, who says that the Gospel of Truth was used
          by the Valentinians, and that it was very dissonant from the
          canonical Gospels.

II. Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles:

          This class of writings originated through the operation of the
          same causes that produced the apocryphal Gospels, though the
          heretical tendency in the Acts is generally more prominent. For
          this reason they were as much feared in the early Church as the
          apocryphal Gospels; and it appears from references in Eusebius,
          Epiphanius, and Augustine that they had great influence. Since
          they were often worked over for dogmatic purposes, criticism has
          to inquire into the antiquity and originality of the existing
          codices. Among those who manufactured apocryphal Acts one Lucius
          (or Leucius) Charinus, a Manichean, is especially mentioned. His
          collection is said to have comprised the Acts of Peter, John,
          Andrew, Thomas, and Paul. Of these a few fragments only are
          preserved in the original form, which were afterward revised to
          accord with catholic dogma; in an enlarged form the collection
          became known as the Acts of the Twelve Apostles, which,
          according to Photius, was used by the Manichean Agapios. It must
          not be overlooked that some of these revised Acts are of a very
          high antiquity; thus the Acts of Peter were in use in the second
          century and the Journeys of Thomas in the third century. A
          collection entitled the Acts of the Holy Apostles is mentioned
          by Greek chroniclers from the sixth century. Toward the end of
          the sixth century a Latin collection became known, ascribed to
          [483]Abdias, the supposed bishop of Babylon. In its original
          form the collection comprised the "passions" of all the twelve
          apostles (including Paul instead of Matthias), in its revised
          form the "virtues" or "miracles" of Peter, Paul, John, Andrew,
          and Thomas, and the "passions" of Matthew, Bartholomew, Philip,
          the two Jameses, both Simons, and Jude, of the older collection.
          A third collection was in use in the Coptic Church, and is
          extant in the Ethiopic language as the Contest of the Apostles
          [best edition by E. A. W. Budge, The Contendings of the
          Apostles, 2 vols., London, 1899-1901]. There are also numerous
          Syriac recensions.

          The most notable of these apocryphal Acts are (1) Acts of Peter
          and Paul, the oldest testimony for which is Eusebius, with
          possibly Clement of Alexandria; (2) Acts of Paul and Thecla,
          known to Tertullian, ascribed to a presbyter in Asia, and
          belonging to the first half of the second century; (3) Acts of
          Barnabas, Told by John Mark, which has another title in some
          Greek manuscripts, Journeys and Martyrdom of the Holy Barnabas
          the Apostle; (4) Acts of Philip, possessing high antiquity and
          having been much used in the literature of both branches of the
          early Church; (5) Acts of Philip in Greece, later than the
          last-mentioned; (6) Acts of Andrew, a very early composition;
          (7) Acts of Andrew and Matthew in the City of the Anthropophagi,
          much used by the Gnostics and Manicheans; (8) Acts and Martyrdom
          of Matthew, to be connected with the last-named as its
          continuation; (9) Acts of Thomas, also a work of high antiquity;
          (10) Consummation of Thomas, the completion of the story begun
          in the foregoing Acts of Thomas; (11) Martyrdom of Bartholomew;
          (12) Acts of Thaddeus (the Syriac reads "of Addas"), built upon
          the very old tradition of the exchange of letters between
          [484]Abgar of Edessa and Christ; (13) Acts of John, likewise
          very old, and esteemed highly by Gnostics and Manicheans; the
          "History of Prochor" mentions the Acts of John, but (14) a
          History of John (in Syriac), and (15) Passion of John have no
          connection with Prochor; while (16) On the Life of John adds
          nothing to the last three. Besides the foregoing, there are many
          fragments of Acts, which do not call for mention. English
          translations of these apocryphal Acts will be found in ANF,
          viii, 477-564.

III. Apocryphal Epistles:

          Besides the fictitious correspondence between Christ and Abgar
          (see [485]Abgar), other alleged writings of Christ are known
          which belong to the realm of mythology (collected by Fabricius,
          i, 303-321; iii, 439, 511-512). There are letters from the
          Virgin Mary to Ignatius, and letters to Mary which are of a very
          late date (given in Fabricius, i, 834, 844, 851). Two letters of
          Peter to James are also known. From Col. iv, 16 it is learned
          that Paul wrote a letter to the Laodiceans which is lost; it is
          not to be wondered at that this lost letter soon found an
          apocryphal substitute, which was in circulation in Jerome's time
          (De vir. ill., v), and was published in many languages (cf.
          Zahn, Kanon, ii, 566 sqq., 584-585; Zahn treats also [ii, 612
          sqq.] of the spurious correspondence between Paul and Seneca).
          Since in I Cor. v, 9, Paul speaks of an earlier letter to the
          Church of Corinth (which has been lost), care was taken to
          substitute another letter to the Corinthians in place of the
          lost one. A Latin text recently discovered was published and
          discussed by Carrière and Berger (La Correspondance apocryphe de
          St. Paul et des Corinthiens, Paris, 1891); cf. A. Harnack (TLZ,
          1892, 2 sqq.), T. Zahn (TLB, 1892, 185 sqq., 193 sqq.), Bratke
          (TLZ, 1892, 585 sqq.).

IV. Apocryphal Apocalypses:

          Although the names of a considerable number of apocryphal
          apocalypses are known, the texts or fragments of texts of only a
          few are extant (collected by Tischendorf, Apocalypses
          Apocryphoe, Leipsic, 1866), viz.: (1) Apocalypse of John:
          Differed from the canonical book of the same name. (2)
          Apocalypse of Peter: Mentioned in the Muratorian Canon and by
          Clement of Alexandria, Methodius, Eusebius, and others. A
          fragment of this apocalypse was recently discovered together
          with the Gospel of Peter (see [486]I [31] above), and published
          at Paris in 1892 (cf. ANF, ix, 141 sqq.). (3) Ascension of Paul:
          Is based on II Cor. xii, 2-4, where Paul tells of being caught
          up into heaven. (4) Apocalypse of Paul: Spoken of by Augustine
          and Sozomen (cf. ANF, viii, 149 sqq.). (5) Apocalypse of
          Bartholomew: Extant only in fragments in a Coptic manuscript in
          the Paris library. (6) Apocalypse of Mary: Exists only in
          fragments of late manuscripts. (7) Apocalypse of Thomas:
          Mentioned in the Decretum Gelasii. (8) Apocalypse of Stephen:
          Based on Acts vii, 55: said to have been in use among the
          Manicheans. For English translations, consult ANF, viii,
          575-586; ix, 141-174.

   Apollinaris, Claudius
          APOLLINARIS, a-pel"li-nê´ris (APOLLINARIUS), CLAUDIUS: Bishop of
          Hierapolis in Phrygia. He was a contemporary of Melito, and
          flourished in the reign of Marcus Aurelius (161-180), occupying
          a prominent position as an apologist and an opponent of
          Montanism, which took its rise in the ecclesiastical province to
          which he belonged. He was a prolific writer, but of his numerous
          works, still much read in the time of Eusebius, only a few, and
          of these little more than the titles, are known. Eusebius (Hist.
          eccl., iv, 27) mentions an apology addressed to the emperor;
          since the story of the "[487]thundering legion" seems to have
          been told in this, it can not have been written before 171,
          though Eusebius, in his Chronicon, assigns it to 170. The same
          historian mentions an apology against the Greeks in five books,
          two books "Concerning Truth," and a letter against the
          Montanists, which is also referred to by Serapion, bishop of
          Antioch, in his letter to Caricus and Pontius. This, according
          to Eusebius, was written later than the apologetic works
          mentioned above, and contained a report of the proceedings of a
          synod held against the Montanists, with a list of signatures of
          the members of the synod. Photius also names a treatise "On
          Piety." The Chronicon Paschale (ed. Dindorf, i, 13) preserves
          two fragments of a work on the Passover, all that has been
          preserved of the work of Apollinaris; these have been
          questioned, but without good reason. Two books against the Jews
          and one against the Severians have been erroneously attributed
          to him. In the catenæ numerous fragments are found with the name
          of Apollinaris attached to them, which have never been carefully
          examined; but it is probable that most, if not all, belong to
          the younger Apollinaris of Laodicea.

   Apollinaris of Laodicea

APOLLINARIS OF LAODICEA:

  Life.

          The name of two men, father and son, known to Church history.
          Apollinaris the Elder was an Alexandrian, taught grammar at
          Berytus, and then at Laodicea in Syria, and was made a presbyter
          at the latter place. What Socrates (Hist. eccl., ii, 46) says of
          his literary activity belongs probably to the son (cf. Sozomen,
          Hist. eccl., v, 18). Apollinaris the Younger was born presumably
          about 310, and was likewise a teacher of rhetoric. About 346 he
          became acquainted with Athanasius; and they remained warm
          friends, notwithstanding theological differences. Athanasius
          calls him a bishop in 362; and, as he was at first an energetic
          representative of Homoousianism in Syria, he was presumably the
          Homoousian antibishop of Pelagius of Laodicea, who belonged to
          the right wing of the middle party. When he proclaimed his
          peculiar views openly can not be stated with certainty. The
          synod at Alexandria in 362 seems to declare against them, and he
          was considered a heretic at the beginning of the seventies.
          Roman synods in 377 and 382 and one at Antioch in 378 testified
          against his doctrine. The second ecumenical council
          (Constantinople, 381) condemned the Apollinarians as the last
          heretics who issued from the Trinitarian controversy, and the
          emperor Theodosius set the great seal upon this condemnation in
          388. Apollinaris was dead when Jerome wrote his Viri Illustres
          in 392.

  Writings.

          Great as is the confusion concerning the life of the man, it is
          still greater as regards his literary activity, which is the
          more to be regretted, as Apollinaris was evidently one of the
          most prominent ecclesiastical writers of the fourth century.
          This may be seen from the high esteem in which he was held
          during his lifetime by friend and foe and from the expressions
          of later writers. According to Philostorgius (Hist. eccl., viii.
          11; cf. xii. 15), Athanasius as a theologian was a child when
          compared with Apollinaris; and as concerns "experience" (e.g.,
          knowledge of Hebrew) he would give the preference to the
          Laodicean above Gregory and Basil. Apollinaris was famous not
          only as a theological author but also as a poet. As a new Homer
          he treated the Old Testament history from the Ovation to Saul in
          twenty-four books, wrote comedies after the pattern of Menander,
          tragedies in the style of Euripides, and odes after Pindaric
          models. There is extant only a "Paraphrase upon the Psalter,"
          which fails to exhibit the poetic genius ascribed to the author.
          Of his exegetical efforts there have been preserved only
          fragments on Proverbs, Ezekiel, Isaiah, and the Epistle to the
          Romans; the exegesis is sober, sensible, and avoids allegory. As
          Christian apologist Apollinaris is said to have surpassed his
          predecessors in his thirty books against Porphyry
          (Philostorgius, viii. 4; Jerome, De vir. ill., civ.; idem,
          Epist., xlviii. 13, lxx. 3; Vincent of Lerins, Commonitorium,
          xi.); he wrote a work, "On Truth," against Julian and the
          philosophy of the time, and opposed the Arians in a work against
          Eunomius of Cyzicus; he wrote also against Marcellus of Ancyra.
          All these writings seem to have been lost. It is also impossible
          to form a correct estimate of his dogmatic writings. All that
          has been directly transmitted are seven larger and some short
          fragments from an "Exposition of the Divine Incarnation in the
          Likeness of Man" (in the rejoinder of Gregory of Nyssa to
          Apollinaris). But it is known that the Apollinarians and
          Monophysites circulated some of the productions of Apollinaris
          under the names of Gregory Thaumaturgus, Athanasius, and Julius
          of Rome to deceive innocent readers as to their true origin and
          nature, and Caspari has proved that the "Sectional Confession of
          Faith," ascribed to Thaumaturgus, belongs to Apollinaris. The
          same may be said of the treatise "On the Incarnation of the Word
          of God," ascribed to Athanasius, and of the alleged epistles of
          Felix of Alexandria and Julius of Rome to Dionysius of
          Alexandria. Attempts (especially of Dräseke) to ascribe other
          works to Apollinaris have been unsuccessful.

  His Christology.

          The tendency of the Athanasian doctrine of redemption to the
          deification of humanity, little as Athanasius himself doubted
          that the Logos had assumed the perfect humanity, was not fitted
          for reviving interest in the human personality of the Redeemer.
          Thus it is not strange that so zealous a champion of the
          homoousios as Apollinaris, with his logical and dialectic
          training, started with doubts upon this point. Perfect God and
          perfect man is, according to his opinion, a monstrosity,
          contradicting all laws of reason. In this way would originate a
          "man-god," a "horse-deer," a "goat-stag,"--fabulous beings like
          the Minotaur. This proves true not only logically, but also on
          comparing the notion of the perfect man with the demands to be
          made upon the Redeemer in the interest of redemption. Supposing
          him to be perfect man, how could Christ be without sin? If, as
          the apostle knew, man consists of spirit (mind), soul, and body,
          the human mind can not be adjudicated to Christ, for this is
          changeable; but the Redeemer has an unchanging mind. Since he
          can not be composed of four parts, he has indeed assumed a human
          body and a human soul, but not a human spirit. The logos
          homoousios rather takes its place. Thus originated the mia
          phusis tou theou logou sesarkomene (not sesarkomenou), in which
          the flesh is deified and which as a whole becomes an object of
          adoration. The consequence is obvious, that all passive
          conditions [the susceptibility to suffering] of the historical
          Jesus are referred to the Logos and consequently to the Deity
          itself, though Apollinaris and some of his adherents recoiled
          from it. The Apollinarian Christology, which made great advances
          to the consciousness of the believers, which in the first line
          is always directed to the divine in Christ, and which seemed to
          lead away farthest from the generally detested thought of the
          "mere man" (Paul of Samosata), has exercised great influence on
          the further development of the Christological doctrine in the
          Eastern Church. With a certain right, one can even say with
          Harnack (Dogmengeschichte, p. 314) that the view of Apollinaris,
          when compared with the presuppositions and aims of the Greek
          conception of Christianity as religion, is perfect; but one can
          only do so by regarding the extremest consequences as the
          correct expression of what is intended. On the further
          development of Apollinarianism see the articles treating of the
          Christological controversies of the fifth and sixth centuries.

          G. Krüger.

          That Apollinaris, side by side with Paul of Samosata and Arius,
          should have come to be regarded as an archheretic, nay as in a
          certain sense the archheretic, is thoroughly intelligible. All
          three with their theories came in violent conflict with
          essential postulates of the Christian piety of the Church; Paul
          destroyed the complete Deity, Apollinaris the complete humanity,
          Arius both. The pious Christian consciousness required in the
          person of Christ ideal humanity and absolute Deity and was
          content to regard the manner of the union of the two as a
          mystery, i.e., as transcending the comprehension of the human
          mind. Yet in so far as it tended to set aside the conception of
          Christ as a "mere man" (Paul of Samosata), the theory of
          Apollinaris was for the time acceptable to many.

   Apollonia, Saint
          APOLLONIA, ??"pel-lO´nî-a, SAINT: A martyr of Alexandria,
          according to a letter from Dionysius, bishop of Alexandria, to
          Fabian of Antioch, preserved by Eusebius (Hist. eccl., vi. 41),
          and giving an account of a persecution of the Alexandrian
          Christians in the winter of 248-249. This persecution was the
          work of the populace, stirred up by the celebration of the
          one-thousandth anniversary of the founding of Rome, but was
          connived at by the authorities. As victims of this outburst
          Dionysius names Metras, Quinta, Sarapion, and Apollonia, whom he
          calls in Greek parthenon presbutin, probably signifying a
          deaconess. Because in her martyrdom all her teeth were knocked
          out, she is popularly regarded in Roman Catholic countries as a
          patroness against toothache. Her festival falls on Feb. 9.

   Apollonius
          APOLLONIUS, ap"el-lO´ni-us: 1. A Roman martyr under Commodus.
          Eusebius (Hist. eccl., v. 21) states that he was renowned for
          his learning and wisdom; he was accused by an "instrument of the
          devil" at a time when the government did not favor religious
          persecution, and consequently the accuser suffered the death
          penalty; the judge, Perennis, wished to save Apollonius, allowed
          him to make an eloquent defense before the senate, but was
          ultimately compelled by the law to condemn the Christian to
          death by beheading. Jerome expands these notices (De vir. ill.,
          xlii., liii.; Epist. lxx., ad Magnum). As the downfall of
          Perennis took place in 185, the martyrdom must be dated between
          181 and that year, probably in 184.

          2. Author of a work against the Montanists, of which Eusebius
          gives a fragment (Hist. eccl., v.18). It was written forty years
          after the appearance of Montanus and shows that the deliverances
          of the new prophets were false and that the conduct of the
          Montanist authorities was opposed to the manner of true
          prophets. According to Jerome (De vir. ill., 1., liii.),
          Tertullian added to his six books De ecstasi, a seventh against
          the charges of Apollonius; but he is mistaken (De vir. ill.,
          xl.) in ascribing to Apollonius what is related by Eusebius in
          Hist. eccl., v. 16. The designation of Apollonius as "leader of
          the Ephesians," in Proedestinatus, xxvi. is a fiction.

   Apollonius of Tyana
          APOLLONIUS OF TYANA: Neo-Pythagorean philosopher, elevated by
          non-Christians to a place by the side of Christ; b. at Tyana in
          Cappadocia, the modern Kiz-Hissar (80 m. n.w. of Tarsus); d. at
          Ephesus, probably, 98 A.D. He was educated at Ephesus and at
          Tarsus, but, disgusted by the immorality of the latter city, he
          went to Ægææ (the modern Ayas, on the Gulf of Iskanderun, 50 m.
          s.e. of Adana). In its temple of Æsculapius he studied medicine
          and philosophy, and became an ardent and lifelong adherent of
          Pythagoras. He observed the five years of absolute silence
          enjoined by the Pythagoreans, and then started on his memorable
          and extensive travels, which took him into all parts of the
          known world, made him acquainted with many prominent persons,
          and gave him a great reputation for wisdom. He seems to have
          exerted a virtuous example and to have been a religious
          reformer. Falling under the suspicion of Domitian, he went to
          Rome for his trial and was acquitted after he had endured a
          brief imprisonment (94 A.D.). The last ten years of his life
          were passed in Greece, where he had many disciples.

          The importance of Apollonius as a religious reformer was more
          and more magnified, and shortly after his death statues and even
          temples were erected in his honor by emperors, and he was
          worshiped as a god. Among his prominent admirers was the
          talented and learned Julia Domna, wife of the emperor Severus,
          who requested one of her literary men, Flavius Philostratus, to
          write for her a biography of Apollonius and for this purpose
          supplied him with data, including the travel-journal of his
          companion, the Assyrian Damis, and a collection of his letters.
          On the basis of these, with large additions of legendary matter
          and notices of every description, the book was prepared; but it
          was not published till after the death of the empress (217). It
          bears every evidence of being a historical novel, and its
          miraculous details are not deserving of analysis; but
          non-Christians ever since have pretended to find in Apollonius a
          pagan Christ, and in the stories told about him, counterparts of
          those related of Christ and his apostles.

          The earliest person named who made this use of Philostratus's
          novel is Hierocles, governor of Bithynia during the Diocletian
          persecution (303), who wrote a work against the Christians in
          which he instituted a comparison between Apollonius and Christ.
          This stirred up the church historian Eusebius, to write a
          refutation, in which he shows how unreliable as a source the
          romance of Philostratus is. The deist Charles Blount (see
          [488]Deism) and Voltaire revived this use of Philostratus in the
          interest of their paganism, while in the nineteenth century
          Ferdinand Christian Baur called attention afresh to
          Philostratus's work and elaborated the thesis that Philostratus
          had purposely modeled his narrative on that of the Gospels.
          Edward Zeller followed him in this advocacy, the Frenchman
          Albert Reville also. But there is no evidence that Philostratus
          had any knowledge of the Gospels and the Acts, and the life of
          the Apostle Paul is a much closer parallel to Apollonius than
          that of Christ, who was no peripatetic philosopher.

   Apollos
          APOLLOS, a-pel´es (probably a contraction from Apollonius): A
          man eminent in New Testament history. His special gifts in
          presenting Christian doctrine made him an important person in
          the congregation at Corinth, and his name came to be attached to
          a faction there (I Cor. i. 12), but there is no indication that
          he favored or approved an overestimation of his person. Nor can
          it be said that Paul objected to his work of presenting the way
          of salvation; on the contrary he thinks Apollos a valuable
          helper in carrying on his work in the important Corinthian
          congregation (I Cor iii. 6, iv. 6, xvi. 12). In harmony with
          Paul's notices are the statements of the Acts of the Apostles
          (xviii. 24-28) that Apollos was a highly educated Alexandrian
          Jew, who came to Ephesus (probably in 54 A.D.), was instructed
          in the gospel there by Aquila and Priscilla, and afterward
          settled in Achaia, where, by the grace of God he showed himself
          useful to the Church. The rest of this notice to the effect that
          he came to Ephesus as a disciple of the Lord and preached Jesus
          in the synagogues, when he knew only of John's baptism, is odd.

          It is difficult to get a correct idea of his religious
          standpoint; but it probably was that of the so-called disciples
          of John, of whom mention is made in Acts xix. 1-7. Taken all in
          all, it may be said that Apollos was a zealous missionary, who,
          while confessing Jesus, did not have the full New Testament
          revelation, and stood in danger of becoming antagonistic to the
          apostolic message to all the world; he became, however, an
          adherent of the Pauline doctrine, and the author of the Acts of
          the Apostles thought this fact of sufficient importance to be
          included in his history. In the Epistle to Titus (iii. 13)
          Apollos is mentioned, with Zenas, as bearer of the letter to
          Crete. The Epistle to the [489]Hebrews has often been ascribed
          to Apollos, beginning with Luther, and he has been suggested as
          the author of the fourth Gospel ([Tobler], Die Evangelienfrage,
          Zurich, 1858).

          The Later Apologetics (§ 11).

  1. Significance of the Term.

          Since Planck (1794) and Schleiermacher (1811), "apologetics" has
          been the accepted name of one of the theological disciplines or
          departments of theological science. The term is derived from the
          Greek apologeisthai, which embodies as its central notion the
          idea of "defense." In its present application, however, it has
          somewhat shifted its meaning, and we speak accordingly of
          apologetics and apologies in contrast with each other. The
          relation between these two is not that of theory and practise
          (so, e.g., Düsterdieck), nor yet that of genus and species (so,
          e.g., Kübel). That is to say, apologetics is not a formal
          science in which the principles exemplified in apologies are
          investigated, as the principles of sermonizing are investigated
          in homiletics. Nor is it merely the sum of all existing or all
          possible apologies, or their quintessence, or their scientific
          exhibition, as dogmatics is the scientific statement of dogmas.
          Apologies are defenses of Christianity, in its entirety, in its
          essence, or in some one or other of its elements or
          presuppositions, as against either all assailants, actual or
          conceivable, or some particular form or instance of attack;
          though, of course, as good defenses they may rise above mere
          defenses and become vindications. Apologetics undertakes not the
          defense, not even the vindication, but the establishment, not,
          strictly speaking, of Christianity, but rather of that knowledge
          of God which Christianity professes to embody and seeks to make
          efficient in the world, and which it is the business of theology
          scientifically to explicate. It may, of course, enter into
          defense and vindication when in the prosecution of its task it
          meets with opposing points of view and requires to establish its
          own standpoint or conclusions. Apologies may, therefore, be
          embraced in apologetics, and form ancillary portions of its
          structure, as they may also do in the case of every other
          theological discipline. It is, moreover, inevitable that this or
          that element or aspect of apologetics will be more or less
          emphasized and cultivated, as the need of it is from time to
          time more or less felt. But apologetics does not derive its
          contents or take its form or borrow its value from the
          prevailing opposition; but preserves through all varying
          circumstances its essential character as a positive and
          constructive science which has to do with opposition only--like
          any other constructive science--as the refutation of opposing
          views becomes from time to time incident to construction. So
          little is defense or vindication of the essence of apologetics
          that there would be the same reason for its existence and the
          same necessity for its work, were there no opposition in the
          world to be encountered and no contradiction to be overcome. It
          finds its deepest ground, in other words, not in the accidents
          which accompany the efforts of true religion to plant, sustain,
          and propagate itself in this world; not even in that most
          pervasive and most portentous of all these accidents, the
          accident of sin; but in the fundamental needs of the human
          spirit. If it is incumbent on the believer to be able to give a
          reason for the faith that is in him, it is impossible for him to
          be a believer without a reason for the faith that is in him; and
          it is the task of apologetics to bring this reason clearly out
          in his consciousness, and make its validity plain. It is, in
          other words, the function of apologetics to investigate,
          explicate, and establish the grounds on which a theology--a
          science, or systematized knowledge of God--is possible; and on
          the basis of which every science which has God for its object
          must rest, if it be a true science with claims to a place within
          the circle of the sciences. It necessarily takes its place,
          therefore, at the head of the departments of theological science
          and finds its task in the establishment of the validity of that
          knowledge of God which forms the subject-matter of these
          departments; that we may then proceed through the succeeding
          departments of exegetical, historical, systematic, and practical
          theology, to explicate, appreciate, systematize, and propagate
          it in the world.

  2. Place Among the Theological Disciplines.

          It must be admitted that considerable confusion has reigned with
          respect to the conception and function of apologetics, and its
          place among the theological disciplines. Nearly every writer has
          a definition of his own, and describes the task of the
          discipline in a fashion more or less peculiar to himself; and
          there is scarcely a corner in the theological encyclopedia into
          which it has not been thrust. Planck gave it a place among the
          exegetical disciplines; others contend that its essence is
          historical; most wish to assign it either to systematic or
          practical theology. Nösselt denies it all right of existence;
          Palmer confesses inability to classify it; Räbiger casts it
          formally out of the encyclopedia, but reintroduces it under the
          different name of "theory of religion." Tholuck proposed that it
          should be apportioned through the several departments; and Cave
          actually distributes its material through three separate
          departments. Much of this confusion is due to a persistent
          confusion of apologetics with apologies. If apologetics is the
          theory of apology, and its function is to teach men how to
          defend Christianity, its place is, of course, along side of
          homiletics, catechetics, and poimenics in practical theology. If
          it is simply, by way of eminence, the apology of Christianity,
          the systematically organized vindication of Christianity in all
          its elements and details, against all opposition or in its
          essential core against the only destructive opposition--it of
          course presupposes the complete development of Christianity
          through the exegetical, historical, and systematic disciplines,
          and must take its place either as the culminating department of
          systematic theology, or as the intellectualistic side of
          practical theology, or as an independent discipline between the
          two. In this case it can be only artificially separated from
          polemic theology and other similar disciplines--if the analysis
          is pushed so far as to create these, as is done by F. Duilhé de
          Saint-Projet who distinguishes between apologetical,
          controversial, and polemic theology, directed respectively
          against unbelievers, heretics, and fellow believers, and by A.
          Kuyper who distinguishes between polemics, elenchtics, and
          apologetics, opposing respectively heterodoxy, paganism, and
          false philosophy. It will not be strange, then, if, though
          separated from these kindred disciplines it, or some of it,
          should be again united with them, or some of them, to form a
          larger whole to which is given the same encyclopedic position.
          This is done for example by Kuyper who joins polemics,
          elenchtics, and apologetics together to form his "antithetic
          dogmatological" group of disciplines; and by F. L. Patton who,
          after having distributed the material of apologetics into the
          two separate disciplines of rational or philosophical theology,
          to which as a thetic discipline a place is given at the outset
          of the system, and apologetics, joins the latter with polemics
          to constitute the antithetical disciplines, while systematic
          theology succeeds both as part of the synthetic disciplines.

  3. Source of Divergent Views.

          Much of the diversity in question is due also, however, to
          varying views of the thing which apologetics undertakes to
          establish; whether it be, for example, the truth of the
          Christian religion, or the validity of that knowledge of God
          which theology presents in systematized form. And more of it
          still is due to profoundly differing conceptions of the nature
          and subject-matter of that "theology," a department of which
          apologetics is. If we think of apologetics as undertaking the
          defense or the vindication or even the justification of the
          "Christian religion," that is one thing; if we think of it as
          undertaking the establishment of the validity of that knowledge
          of God, which "theology" systematizes, that may be a very
          different thing. And even if agreement exists upon the latter
          conception, there remain the deeply cutting divergences which
          beset the definition of "theology" itself. Shall it be defined
          as the "science of faith"? or as the "science of religion"? or
          as the "science of the Christian religion"? or as the "science
          of God"? In other words, shall it be regarded as a branch of
          psychology, or as a branch of history, or as a branch of
          science? Manifestly those who differ thus widely as to what
          theology is, can not be expected to agree as to the nature and
          function of any one of its disciplines. If "theology" is the
          science of faith or of religion, its subject-matter is the
          subjective experiences of the human heart; and the function of
          apologetics is to inquire whether these subjective experiences
          have any objective validity. Of course, therefore, it follows
          upon the systematic elucidation of these subjective experiences
          and constitutes the culminating discipline of "theology."
          Similarly, if "theology" is the science of the Christian
          religion, it investigates the purely historical question of what
          those who are called Christians believe; and of course the
          function of apologetics is to follow this investigation with an
          inquiry whether Christians are justified in believing these
          things. But if theology is the science of God, it deals not with
          a mass of subjective experiences, nor with a section of the
          history of thought, but with a body of objective facts; and it
          is absurd to say that these facts must be assumed and developed
          unto their utmost implications before we stop to ask whether
          they are facts. So soon as it is agreed that theology is a
          scientific discipline and has as its subject-matter the
          knowledge of God, we must recognize that it must begin by
          establishing the reality as objective facts of the data upon
          which it is based. One may indeed call the department of
          theology to which this task is committed by any name which
          appears to him appropriate: it may be called "general theology,"
          or "fundamental theology," or "principal theology," or
          "philosophical theology," or "rational theology," or "natural
          theology," or any other of the innumerable names which have been
          used to describe it. Apologetics is the name which most
          naturally suggests itself, and it is the name which, with more
          or less accuracy of view as to the nature and compass of the
          discipline, has been consecrated to this purpose by a large
          number of writers from Schleiermacher down (e.g., Pelt, Twesten,
          Baumstark, Swetz, Ottiger, Knoll, Maissoneuve). It powerfully
          commends itself as plainly indicating the nature of the
          discipline, while equally applicable to it whatever may be the
          scope of the theology which it undertakes to plant on a secure
          basis. Whether this theology recognizes no other knowledge of
          God than that given in the constitution and course of nature, or
          derives its data from the full revelation of God as documented
          in the Christian scriptures, apologetics offers itself with
          equal readiness to designate the discipline by which the
          validity of the knowledge of God set forth is established. It
          need imply no more than natural theology requires for its basis;
          when the theology which it serves is, however, the complete
          theology of the Christian revelation, it guards its unity and
          protects from the fatally dualistic conception which sets
          natural and revealed theology over against each other as
          separable entities, each with its own separate presuppositions
          requiring establishment by which apologetics would be split into
          two quite diverse disciplines, given very different places in
          the theological encyclopedia.

  4. The True Task of Apologetics.

          It will already have appeared how far apologetics may be
          defined, in accordance with a very prevalent custom (e.g., Sack,
          Lechler, Ebrard, Kübel, Lemme) as "the science which establishes
          the truth of Christianity as the absolute religion." Apologetics
          certainly does establish the truth of Christianity as the
          absolute religion. But the question of importance here is how it
          does this. It certainly is not the business of apologetics to
          take up each tenet of Christianity in turn and seek to establish
          its truth by a direct appeal to reason. Any attempt to do this,
          no matter on what philosophical basis the work of demonstration
          be begun or by what methods it be pursued, would transfer us at
          once into the atmosphere and betray us into the devious devices
          of the old vulgar rationalism, the primary fault of which was
          that it asked for a direct rational demonstration of the truth
          of each Christian teaching in turn. The business of apologetics
          is to establish the truth of Christianity as the absolute
          religion directly only as a whole, and in its details only
          indirectly. That is to say, we are not to begin by developing
          Christianity into all its details, and only after this task has
          been performed, tardily ask whether there is any truth in all
          this. We are to begin by establishing the truth of Christianity
          as a whole, and only then proceed to explicate it into its
          details, each of which, if soundly explicated, has its truth
          guaranteed by its place as a detail in an entity already
          established in its entirety. Thus we are delivered from what is
          perhaps the most distracting question which has vexed the whole
          history of the discipline. In establishing the truth of
          Christianity, it has been perennially asked, are we to deal with
          all its details (e.g., H. B. Smith), or merely with the essence
          of Christianity (e.g., Kübel). The true answer is, neither.
          Apologetics does not presuppose either the development of
          Christianity into its details, or the extraction from it of its
          essence. The details of Christianity are all contained in
          Christianity: the minimum of Christianity is just Christianity
          itself. What apologetics undertakes to establish is just this
          Christianity itself--including all its "details" and involving
          its "essence"--in its unexplicated and uncompressed entirety, as
          the absolute religion. It has for its object the laying of the
          foundations on which the temple of theology is built, and by
          which the whole structure of theology is determined. It is the
          department of theology which establishes the constitutive and
          regulative principles of theology as a science; and in
          establishing these it establishes all the details which are
          derived from them by the succeeding departments, in their sound
          explication and systematization. Thus it establishes the whole,
          though it establishes the whole in the mass, so to speak, and
          not in its details, but yet in its entirety and not in some
          single element deemed by us its core, its essence, or its
          minimum expression.

  5. Division of Apologetics.

          The subject-matter of apologetics being determined, its
          distribution into its parts becomes very much a matter of
          course. Having defined apologetics as the proof of the truth of
          the Christian religion, many writers naturally confine it to
          what is commonly known somewhat loosely as the "evidences of
          Christianity." Others, defining it as "fundamental theology,"
          equally naturally confine it to the primary principles of
          religion in general. Others more justly combine the two
          conceptions and thus obtain at least two main divisions. Thus
          Hermann Schultz makes it prove "the right of the religious
          conception of the world, as over against the tendencies to the
          denial of religion, and the right of Christianity as the
          absolutely perfect manifestation of religion, as over against
          the opponents of its permanent significance." He then divides it
          into two great sections with a third interposed between them:
          the first, "the apology of the religious conception of the
          world;" the last, "the apology of Christianity;" while between
          the two stands "the philosophy of religion, religion in its
          historical manifestation." Somewhat less satisfactorily, because
          with a less firm hold upon the idea of the discipline, Henry B.
          Smith, viewing apologetics as "historico-philosophical
          dogmatics," charged with the defense of "the whole contents and
          substance of the Christian faith," divided the material to much
          the same effect into what he calls fundamental, historical, and
          philosophical apologetics. The first of these undertakes to
          demonstrate the being and nature of God; the second, the divine
          origin and authority of Christianity; and the third, somewhat
          lamely as a conclusion to so high an argument, the superiority
          of Christianity to all other systems. Quite similarly Francis R.
          Beattie divided into (1) fundamental or philosophical
          apologetics, which deals with the problem of God and religion;
          (2) Christian or historical apologetics, which deals with the
          problem of revelation and the Scriptures; and (3) applied or
          practical apologetics, which deals with the practical efficiency
          of Christianity in the world. The fundamental truth of these
          schematizations lies in the perception that the subject-matter
          of apologetics embraces the two great facts of God and
          Christianity. There is some failure in unity of conception,
          however, arising apparently from a deficient grasp of the
          peculiarity of apologetics as a department of theological
          science, and a consequent inability to permit it as such to
          determine its own contents and the natural order of its
          constituent parts.

  6. The Conception of Theology as a Science.

          If theology be a science at all, there is involved in that fact,
          as in the case of all other sciences, at least these three
          things: the reality of its subject-matter, the capacity of the
          human mind to receive into itself and rationally to reflect this
          subject-matter, the existence of media of communication between
          the subject-matter and the percipient and understanding mind.
          There could be no psychology were there not a mind to be
          investigated, a mind to investigate, and a self-consciousness by
          means of which the mind as an object can be brought under the
          inspection of the mind as subject. There could be no astronomy
          were there no heavenly bodies to be investigated, no mind
          capable of comprehending the laws of their existence and
          movements, or no means of observing their structure and motion.
          Similarly there can be no theology, conceived according to its
          very name as the science of God, unless there is a God to form
          its subject-matter, a capacity in the human mind to apprehend
          and so far to comprehend God, and some media by which God is
          made known to man. That a theology, as the science of God, may
          exist, therefore, it must begin by establishing the existence of
          God, the capacity of the human mind to know him, and the
          accessibility of knowledge concerning him. In other words, the
          very idea of theology as the science of God gives these three
          great topics which must be dealt with in its fundamental
          department, by which the foundations for the whole structure are
          laid,--God, religion, revelation. With these three facts
          established, a theology as the science of God becomes possible;
          with them, therefore, an apologetic might be complete. But that,
          only provided that in these three topics all the underlying
          presuppositions of the science of God actually built up in our
          theology are established; for example, provided that all the
          accessible sources and means of knowing God are exhausted. No
          science can arbitrarily limit the data lying within its sphere
          to which it will attend. On pain of ceasing to be the science it
          professes to be, it must exhaust the means of information open
          to it, and reduce to a unitary system the entire body of
          knowledge in its sphere. No science can represent itself as
          astronomy, for example, which arbitrarily confines itself to the
          information concerning the heavenly bodies obtainable by the
          unaided eye, or which discards, without sound ground duly
          adduced, the aid of, say, the spectroscope. In the presence of
          Christianity in the world making claim to present a revelation
          of God adapted to the condition and needs of sinners, and
          documented in Scriptures, theology can not proceed a step until
          it has examined this claim; and if the claim be substantiated,
          this substantiation must form a part of the fundamental
          department of theology in which are laid the foundations for the
          systematization of the knowledge of God. In that case, two new
          topics are added to the subject-matter with which apologetics
          must constructively deal, Christianity--and the Bible. It thus
          lies in the very nature of apologetics as the fundamental
          department of theology, conceived as the science of God, that it
          should find its task in establishing the existence of a God who
          is capable of being known by man and who has made himself known,
          not only in nature but in revelations of his grace to lost
          sinners, documented in the Christian Scriptures. When
          apologetics has placed these great facts in our hands--God,
          religion, revelation, Christianity, the Bible--and not till then
          are we prepared to go on and explicate the knowledge of God thus
          brought to us, trace the history of its workings in the world,
          systematize it, and propagate it in the world.

  7. The Five Subdivisions of Apologetics.

          The primary subdivisions of apologetics are therefore five,
          unless for convenience of treatment it is preferred to sink the
          third into its most closely related fellow. (1) The first, which
          may perhaps be called philosophical apologetics, undertakes the
          establishment of the being of God, as a personal spirit, the
          Creator, preserver, and governor of all things. To it belongs
          the great problem of theism, with the involved discussion of the
          antitheistic theories. (2) The second, which may perhaps be
          called psychological apologetics, undertakes the establishment
          of the religious nature of man and the validity of his religious
          sense. It involves the discussion alike of the psychology, the
          philosophy, and the phenomenology of religion, and therefore
          includes what is loosely called "comparative religion" or the
          "history of religions." (3) To the third falls the establishment
          of the reality of the supernatural factor in history, with the
          involved determination of the actual relations in which God
          stands to his world, and the method of his government of his
          rational creatures, and especially his mode of making himself
          known to them. It issues in the establishment of the fact of
          revelation as the condition of all knowledge of God, who as a
          personal Spirit can be known only so far as he expresses
          himself; so that theology differs from all other sciences in
          that in it the object is not at the disposal of the subject, but
          vice versa. (4) The fourth, which may be called historical
          apologetics, undertakes to establish the divine origin of
          Christianity as the religion of revelation in the special sense
          of that word. It discusses all the topics which naturally fall
          under the popular caption of the "evidences of Christianity."
          (5) The fifth, which may be called bibliological apologetics,
          undertakes to establish the trustworthiness of the Christian
          Scriptures as the documentation of the revelation of God for the
          redemption of sinners. It is engaged especially with such topics
          as the divine origin of the Scriptures; the methods of the
          divine operation in their origination; their place in the series
          of redemptive acts of God, and in the process of revelation; the
          nature, mode, and effect of inspiration; and the like.

  8. The Value of Apologetics.

          The estimate which is put upon apologetics by scholars naturally
          varies with the conception which is entertained of its nature
          and function. In the wake of the subjectivism introduced by
          Schleiermacher, it has become very common to speak of such an
          apologetic as has just been outlined with no little scorn. It is
          an evil inheritance, we are told, from the old supranaturalismus
          vulgaris, which "took its standpoint not in the Scriptures but
          above the Scriptures, and imagined it could, with formal
          conceptions, develop a "ground for the divine authority of
          Christianity" (Heubner), and therefore offered proofs for the
          divine origin of Christianity, the necessity of revelation, and
          the credibility of the Scriptures" (Lemma). To recognize that we
          can take our standpoint in the Scriptures only after we have
          Scriptures, authenticated as such, to take our standpoint in,
          is, it seems, an outworn prejudice. The subjective experience of
          faith is conceived to be the ultimate fact; and the only
          legitimate apologetic, just the self-justification of this faith
          itself. For faith, it seems, after Kant, can no longer be looked
          upon as a matter of reasoning and does not rest on rational
          grounds, but is an affair of the heart, and manifests itself
          most powerfully when it has no reason out of itself
          (Brunetière). If repetition had probative force, it would long
          ago have been established that faith, religion, theology, lie
          wholly outside of the realm of reason, proof, and demonstration.

          It is, however, from the point of view of rationalism and
          mysticism that the value of apologetics is most decried.
          Wherever rationalistic preconceptions have penetrated, there, of
          course, the validity of the apologetic proofs has been in more
          or less of their extent questioned. Wherever mystical sentiment
          has seeped in, there the validity of apologetics has been with
          more or less emphasis doubted. At the present moment, the
          rationalistic tendency is most active, perhaps, in the form
          given it by Albrecht Ritschl. In this form it strikes at the
          very roots of apologetics, by the distinction it erects between
          theoretical and religious knowledge. Religious knowledge is not
          the knowledge of fact, but a perception of utility; and
          therefore positive religion, while it may be historically
          conditioned, has no theoretical basis, and is accordingly not
          the object of rational proof. In significant parallelism with
          this, the mystical tendency is manifesting itself at the present
          day most distinctly in a wide-spread inclination to set aside
          apologetics in favor of the "witness of the Spirit." The
          convictions of the Christian man, we are told, are not the
          product of reason addressed to the intellect, but the immediate
          creation of the Holy Spirit in the heart. Therefore, it is
          intimated, we may do very well without these reasons, if indeed
          they are not positively noxious, because tending to substitute a
          barren intellectualism for a vital faith. It seems to be
          forgotten that though faith be a moral act and the gift of God,
          it is yet formally conviction passing into confidence; and that
          all forms of convictions must rest on evidence as their ground,
          and it is not faith but reason which investigates the nature and
          validity of this ground. "He who believes," says Thomas Aquinas,
          in words which have become current as an axiom, "would not
          believe unless he saw that what he believes is worthy of
          belief." Though faith is the gift of God, it does not in the
          least follow that the faith which God gives is an irrational
          faith, that is, a faith without cognizable ground in right
          reason. We believe in Christ because it is rational to believe
          in him, not even though it be irrational. Of course mere
          reasoning can not make a Christian; but that is not because
          faith is not the result of evidence, but because a dead soul can
          not respond to evidence. The action of the Holy Spirit in giving
          faith is not apart from evidence, but along with evidence; and
          in the first instance consists in preparing the soul for the
          reception of the evidence.

  9. Relation of Apologetics to Christian Faith.

          This is not to argue that it is by apologetics that men are made
          Christians, but that apologetics supplies to Christian men the
          systematically organized basis on which the faith of Christian
          men must rest. All that apologetics explicates in the forms of
          systematic proof is implicit in every act of Christian faith.
          Whenever a sinner accepts Jesus Christ as his savior, there is
          implicated in that act a living conviction that there is a God,
          knowable to man, who has made himself known in a revelation of
          himself for redemption in Jesus Christ, as is set down in the
          Scriptures. It is not necessary for his act of faith that all
          the grounds of this conviction should be drawn into full
          consciousness and given the explicit assent of his
          understanding, though it is necessary for his faith that
          sufficient ground for his conviction be actively present and
          working in his spirit. But it is necessary for the vindication
          of his faith to reason in the form of scientific judgment, that
          the grounds on which it rests be explicated and established.
          Theology as a science, though it includes in its culminating
          discipline, that of practical theology, an exposition of how
          that knowledge of God with which it deals objectively may best
          be made the subjective possession of man, is not itself the
          instrument of propaganda; what it undertakes to do is
          systematically to set forth this knowledge of God as the object
          of rational contemplation. And as it has to set it forth as
          knowledge, it must of course begin by establishing its right to
          rank as such. Did it not do so, the whole of its work would hang
          in the air, and theology would present the odd spectacle among
          the sciences of claiming a place among a series of systems of
          knowledge for an elaboration of pure assumptions.

  10. The Earliest Apologetics.

          Seeing that it thus supplies an insistent need of the human
          spirit, the world has, of course, never been without its
          apologetics. Whenever men have thought at all they have thought
          about God and the supernatural order; and whenever they have
          thought of God and the supernatural order, there has been
          present to their minds a variety of more or less solid reasons
          for believing in their reality. The enucleation of these reasons
          into a systematically organized body of proofs waited of course
          upon advancing culture. But the advent of apologetics did not
          wait for the advent of Christianity; nor are traces of this
          department of thought discoverable only in the regions lit up by
          special revelation. The philosophical systems of antiquity,
          especially those which derive from Plato, are far from empty of
          apologetical elements; and when in the later, stages of its
          development, classical philosophy became peculiarly religious,
          express apologetical material became almost predominant. With
          the coming of Christianity into the world, however, as the
          contents of the theology to be stated became richer, so the
          efforts to substantiate it became more fertile in apologetical
          elements. We must not confuse the apologies of the early
          Christian ages with formal apologetics. Like the sermons of the
          day, they contributed to apologetics without being it. The
          apologetic material developed by what one may call the more
          philosophical of the apologists (Aristides, Athenagoras, Tatian,
          Theophilus, Hermias, Tertullian) was already considerable; it
          was largely supplemented by the theological labors of their
          successors. In the first instance Christianity, plunged into a
          polytheistic environment and called upon to contend with systems
          of thought grounded in pantheistic or dualistic assumptions,
          required to establish its theistic standpoint; and as over
          against the bitterness of the Jews and the mockery of the
          heathen (e.g., Tacitus, Fronto, Crescens, Lucian), to evince its
          own divine origin as a gift of grace to sinful man. Along with
          Tertullian, the great Alexandrians, Clement and Origen, are the
          richest depositaries of the apologetic thought of the first
          period. The greatest apologists of the patristic age were,
          however, Eusebius of Cæsarea and Augustine. The former was the
          most learned and the latter the most profound of all the
          defenders of Christianity among the Fathers. And Augustine, in
          particular, not merely in his "City of God" but in his
          controversial writings, accumulated a vast mesa of apologetical
          material which is far from having lost its significance even
          yet.

  11. The Later Apologetics.

          It was not, however, until the scholastic age that apologetics
          came to its rights as a constructive science. The whole
          theological activity of the Middle Ages was so far ancillary to
          apologetics, that its primary effort was the justification of
          faith to reason. It was not only rich in apologists (Agobard,
          Abelard, Raymund Martini), but every theologian was in a sense
          an apologist. Anselm at its beginning, Aquinas at its
          culmination, are types of the whole series; types in which all
          its excellencies are summed up. The Renaissance with its
          repristination of heathenism, naturally called out a series of
          new apologists (Savonarola, Marsilius Ficinus, Ludovicus Vives)
          but the Reformation forced polemics into the foreground and
          drove apologetics out of sight, although, of course, the great
          theologians of the Reformation era brought their rich
          contribution to the accumulating apologetical material. When, in
          the exhaustion of the seventeenth century, irreligion began to
          spread among the people and indifferentism ripening into
          naturalism among the leaders of thought, the stream of
          apologetical thought was once more started flowing, to swell
          into a great flood as the prevalent unbelief intensified and
          spread. With a forerunner in Philippe de Mornay (1581), Hugo
          Grotius (1627) became the typical apologist of the earlier
          portion of this period, while its middle portion was illuminated
          by the genius of Pascal (d. 1662) and the unexampled richness of
          apologetical labor in its later years culminated in Butler's
          great Analogy (1736) and Paley's plain but powerful
          argumentation. As the assault against Christianity shifted its
          basis from the English deism of the early half of the eighteenth
          century through the German rationalism of its later half, the
          idealism which dominated the first half of the nineteenth
          century, and thence to the materialism of its later years,
          period after period was marked in the history of apology, and
          the particular elements of apologetics which were especially
          cultivated changed with the changing thought. But no epoch was
          marked in the history of apologetics itself, until under the
          guidance of Schleiermacher's attempt to trace the organism of
          the departments of theology, K. H. Sack essayed to set forth a
          scientifically organized "Christian Apologetics" (Hamburg, 1829;
          2d ed., 1841). Since then an unbroken series of scientific
          systems of apologetics has flowed from the press. These differ
          from one another in almost every conceivable way; in their
          conception of the nature, task, compass, and encyclopedic place
          of the science; in their methods of dealing with its material;
          in their conception of Christianity itself; and of religion and
          of God and of the nature of the evidence on which belief in one
          or the other must rest. But they agree in the fundamental point
          that apologetics is conceived by all alike as a special
          department of theological science, capable of and demanding
          separate treatment. In this sense apologetics has come at last,
          in the last two-thirds of the nineteenth century, to its rights.
          The significant names in its development are such as, perhaps,
          among the Germans, Sack, Steudel, Delitzsch, Ebrard, Baumstark,
          Tölle, Kratz, Kübel, Steude, Franck, Kaftan, Vogel, Schultz,
          Kähler; to whom may be added such Romanists as Drey, Dieringer,
          Staudenmeyer, Hettinger, Schanz, and such English-speaking
          writers as Hetherington, H. B. Smith, Bruce, Rishell, and
          Beattie.

   Aportanus, Georg
          APORTANUS, ap"Or-t??´nus, GEORG (Jurien, or Jürjen, van der
          Dare, Daere, or Dure): Early follower of Luther in East
          Friesland; b. at Zwolle; d. in the autumn of 1530. He was
          brought up in Zwolle by the Brethren of the Common Life, and
          became teacher in their school. In 1518 Count Edzard of East
          Friesland called him to Emden to educate his sons. With the
          support of the count, he began to preach Luther's doctrines at
          Norden in 1519, was excluded from the pulpit in consequence, and
          then preached in the open air till the importunity of the people
          brought him back as chief pastor. In 1529 he held a disputation
          at Oldersum, presided over by the influential Ulrich of Dornum,
          and induced many to adopt Luther's teachings.

   Apostasy
          APOSTASY (Gk. Apostasia, "Revolt"): According to the teaching of
          the earlier ages, apostasy might be either apoatasia perfidioe,
          inobedientite, or irregularitatis (i.e., revolt against the
          faith, authority, or the rules). The two latter classes often
          ran into each other, and have been reduced by later theologians
          to two distinct though still related kinds of desertion, namely,
          apostasia a monachatu and a clericatu, which of course occur
          only in non-Protestant churches, while the apostasia a fide or
          perfidioe is contemplated in Protestant church law also.
          Apostasia a monachatu, the abandonment of the monastic life,
          takes place when a member of a religious order leaves it and
          returns to the world, whether as a cleric or as a layman,
          without permission of the proper authority. Apostasia a
          clericatu, the abandonment of orders, is in like manner the
          unauthorized return to the world of a person in holy orders; the
          minor orders which require no irrevocable self-dedication do not
          come under the same head. As early as the Council of Chalcedon
          (451) such offenders were excommunicated; and later
          ecclesiastical law maintains this position even more strongly,
          requiring the offender's diocesan to arrest and imprison him, if
          a cleric, or, if a monk, to deliver him to the authorities of
          his order, to be punished according to its own laws. In
          non-Catholic countries both classes of apostates may commonly be
          forgiven on condition of voluntary return to obedience; and the
          bishops possess various faculties for the purpose. Neither of
          these forms of apostasy is punished by the State.

          Apostasia a fide is the deliberate denial, expressed by outward
          acts, of the Christian faith, whether connected or not with the
          adoption of a non-Christian religion. This is allied to heresy,
          of which, in fact, it forms a higher degree. The passages of
          Scripture on which the treatment of this form of apostasy is
          based are Heb. iii. 12, vi. 4-9, x. 16-29; II Pet. ii. 15-21; II
          John 9-11; Luke xii. 9. During the epoch of persecution such
          apostasy was of course far commoner than in later times; but the
          primitive Church made a distinction, calling apostates only
          those who had abandoned the faith of their own free will,
          distinguishing them from those who had yielded to violence or
          seduction. According to the various manners of denying Christ,
          they were classified as libellatici, sacrificati, traditores,
          etc. (see [493]Lapsed). All were by the very nature of the case
          excommunicated, and at first some churches felt bound, in
          accordance with the passages cited above, to refuse absolution
          altogether or withhold it until the hour of death. Afterward
          this severity decreased, and apostates, like other
          excommunicated persons, were restored to communion on fitting
          penance. Among later enactments, the decree of Boniface VIII.
          (1294-1303) prescribing the same procedure for apostates to
          Judaism as for heretics has been of special influence not only
          in ecclesiastical, but in civil legislation.

          Under the first Christian emperors, the Roman state considered
          apostasy as a civil crime, to be punished by confiscation of
          goods, inability to make wills or serve as a witness, and
          infamy. During the Middle Ages the Empire had no occasion to
          adopt special legislation against apostasy, but was content to
          adhere to the ecclesiastical view of it as a qualified heresy.
          Since in the countries for which the Protestant legal codes were
          designed apostasy to Judaism or idolatry was not looked for,
          they make no mention of such a crime. It is, however, in the
          very nature of a State Church, that it can not tolerate
          desertion of its communion, but must mark its sense of the evil
          by such means as are in its power. Nowadays, of course, the aid
          of the State can no longer be called in to punish such
          offenders.

   Apostle
          APOSTLE ("One Sent [of God]"): A name applied in the Old
          Testament to the chosen organs of the divine revelation (Num.
          xvi. 28; Isa. vi. 8; Jer. xxvi. 5).

  The Twelve.

          In the New Testament it is used not only in a special sense for
          Jesus himself, but also for John the Baptist (John i. 6) and for
          those whom Jesus sent forth (cf. Luke xi. 49 with Matt. xxiii.
          34, 37). It would seem that the name was chosen by Jesus himself
          for the Twelve, since it came so early into use as a definite
          term for a definite body of men, and then for others who held or
          claimed a similar position (Acts xiv. 4, 14; II Cor. xi. 5, xii.
          11; I Thess. ii. 6; Rev. ii. 2). The training of the Twelve
          shows that they had a future mission, which was fully opened to
          them by the appearance and teaching of the risen Christ (Acts i.
          2-11); they are to be witnesses to him, and especially to his
          resurrection, before all peoples. Their number, corresponding to
          that of the twelve tribes, shows that they are destined
          primarily to work among the children of Israel, to whom,
          accordingly, they make their first appeal in Jerusalem. By
          degrees they collect around them a distinct community, in which
          they hold the position of appointed leaders (Acts ii. 42, iv.
          35, v. 1-2, vi. 1-2), and after persecution begins to spread the
          Gospel throughout Palestine and its neighborhood, they remain
          mostly in Jerusalem, thence exercising supervision over the
          Church of the Circumcision (Acts viii. 14, ix. 32-43), and
          providing for the performance of some of their internal duties
          by the choice of deacons and the formation of the college of
          presbyters under James.

  Paul.

          The original apostles are still occupied with the Jews when
          their number receives an addition; the manner of Saul's
          conversion shows that he is destined to a similar work, but
          especially among the Gentiles (Acts ix. 1-31; Gal. i. 11-24).
          This involves, despite Paul's consciousness of equal authority
          and independence, no breach with the earlier organization. His
          ministry, begun by a miracle, develops itself in perfect
          continuity and in unity with that of the older apostles. His
          very conversion and call do not take place without the
          intervention of a member of the existing community (Acts ix.
          10-18, xxii. 12-16); only after an unsuccessful attempt to work
          among the Jews does he turn to the Gentiles (Acts ix. 20-31,
          xxii. 17-21), and even then he enters the work already founded
          from Jerusalem as an auxiliary of Barnabas, who is sent thence
          (Acts xi. 25); he is sent out only with Barnabas by the combined
          Jewish and Gentile community, with his attention directed first
          to the conversion of the Jews (Acts xiii.), and only the
          stubborn opposition of the synagogues causes him to decide in
          favor of the direct mission to the Gentiles (verse 46). He is,
          however, fully recognized at the [494]Apostolic Council at
          Jerusalem by the older apostles and the representatives of
          Jewish Christianity as an independent apostle to the Gentiles;
          and no opposition from Jewish Christians in Galatia or at
          Corinth makes them recede from this attitude. In all his
          far-reaching activity as head of the Gentile Church, he never
          forgets the welfare and the future of his own countrymen (Rom.
          xi. 13-14); nor is there any division between the Gentile Church
          and the older apostles, to his unity with whom Paul constantly
          appeals in teaching his converts (I Cor. xv. 3; Eph. ii. 20,
          iii. 5).

  Later Use of the Term.

          The work of the Twelve was by no means confined to the
          Circumcision. At the end of the Pauline period Peter was still,
          both in person and by letters, exercising apostolic influence
          among the Gentiles, and after Paul's death, John took the place
          of leader among them. Yet the special relation of the Twelve to
          the work among the twelve tribes is emphasized by the promise
          for the future in Matt. xix. 28. Though the word "apostle" is
          used in the New Testament in a wider sense, properly it is
          limited to the first and highest office in the Church, distinct
          from all other offices (I Cor. xii. 28; Eph. iv. 11), to be
          filled only by those personally chosen by the Lord; and after
          their death no others filled exactly the same place. [The word
          was used also in the early Church as a convenient term by which
          to refer to the epistolary literature of the New Testament (see
          [495]Evangeliarium). It has been employed to designate the first
          or the principal missionary to a people, as Columba, Augustine
          of Canterbury, and others. It is used also in some modern
          Churches as the title of high dignitaries, as among the
          Mormons.]

  1. The First Ecumenical Creeds.

          The Apostles' Creed or Apostolicum (i.e., apostolicum symbolum)
          is the briefest of the so-called ecumenical creeds (see
          [496]Symbolics). With the Nicæno-Constantinopolitan and
          Athanasian creeds, for more than five centuries preceding the
          Protestant Reformation it was in use in the West and enjoyed
          especial authority (cf. E. Köllner, Symbolik, Hamburg, 1857, p.
          5). The Eastern Church has never traced any symbol to the
          apostles, or designated any as apostolic in the strict sense of
          the word; and here and there in the West the
          Nicæno-Constantinopolitan creed has been called apostolic (cf.
          Caspari, i. 242, note 45; ii. 115, note 88; iii. 12, note 22).
          The three chief branches of the Church in the West, however,
          have the so called symbolum apostolicum in essentially the same
          form (textus receptus).

  2. Present Form not Earlier than Fifth Century.

          Apart from details the textus receptus can be traced with some
          degree of certainty to the beginning of the sixth or the end of
          the fifth century. On the other hand, it can be proved that
          before that time this form of the symbol was nowhere used
          officially in any Church whether among the interrogationes de
          fide or the traditio and redditio symboli; nor can any traces of
          it be discovered before the middle of the fifth century. Since
          it by no means came to the West from the East, and in the
          Western provincial Churches symbols were in use which differ
          greatly from the textus receptus of the Apostolicum, it follows
          that the latter could hardly have existed before the middle of
          the fifth century, and most likely originated about 500.

  3. Earliest Appearance.

          In its present form the Apostolicum is first found in a sermon
          of Cæsarius of Arles (d. 542; Pseudo-Augustine, 244; cf.
          Kattenbusch, i. 164 sqq.), with which may be compared Sermo,
          240, 241 (texts in Hahn, §§ 47-49), and the symbol in the
          Missale Gallicanum vetus (Hahn, § 36). The immediate predecessor
          of Cæsarius' and, consequently, of our "apostles' creed" is most
          likely the symbol of Faustus of Riez of about 460 (Hahn, § 38;
          Kattenbusch, pp. 158 sqq.), but its reconstruction is difficult.
          On the other hand, the stage succeeding that of the old Roman
          symbol (see below) in the direction of our Apostolicum is
          represented by the highly interesting symbol discovered by
          Bratke in the Bern Codex n. 645 sæc. vii. (SK, lxviii., 1895,
          153 sqq.), which is to be regarded as a Gallican, or rather
          Gallico-British, symbol belonging to the fourth century. It
          differs from the ancient Roman symbol only by the additions of
          passus, descendit ad inferos, catholicam, and vitam oeternam.
          These four additions all tend in the direction of our
          Apostolicum and at the same time prove that they are the four
          older additions, while conceptus, etc., and communionem
          sanctorum are the later ones (but creatorem coeli et terroe and
          mortuus are also older).

  4. Legend of its Origin.

          Two considerations are against a Roman origin of the
          Apostolicum: (1) It is not found in Rome until the Middle Ages,
          i.e., many centuries after its attestation by Cæsarius of Arles;
          (2) From the end of the fifth, or the beginning of the sixth
          century until the tenth the Nicæno-Constantinopolitan creed in
          Greek was used in Rome in the traditio symboli, and not the
          Apostolicum (Caspari, iii. 201-202, 226; ii. 114-115, note 88);
          a shorter symbol was also in use in Rome (see below), but it was
          not identical with the Apostolicum. With the spread of the
          textus receptus in western Europe during the sixth century, the
          legend of its wondrous origin also spread (cf. Hahn, § 46b). The
          fact that such a late symbol is called from the very beginning
          "the Apostolic," still more, that, as concerns its origin, it is
          traced back to a "bringing together" (Gk. symbole, Lat.
          collatio) because each of the twelve apostles in a meeting
          before their separation is said to have contributed a sentence
          to it, supposes that the history of the symbol did not commence
          with the end of the fifth century, but that the textus receptus
          was preceded by another form, the attributes of which were
          transferred to the new text and supplanted it. This supposition
          which the very simple contents and the brief, precise form of
          the symbol suggest, is also sufficiently confirmed by history.

  5. Greek Text of the Roman Symbol.

          By the investigations of Ussher, and more especially by those of
          Caspari, it has become evident that between 250 and 460 a symbol
          was used in the religious service of the Roman Church, which was
          highly esteemed, and to which no additions were permitted; as
          early as the fourth century this symbol was held to be derived
          directly from the twelve apostles in the form in which it was
          used, and it was supposed to have been brought to Rome by Peter.
          This symbol, the older, shorter Roman (in distinction from the
          Apostolicum, which is sometimes called the later, longer Roman,
          because it owes its general authority in the West to Rome), is
          completely extant in a number of texts (Hahn, §§ 14-20; Caspari,
          ii. 48; iii. 4, 5, 28-203). In its original Greek text it runs
          thus:

          Pisteuo eis theon patera pantokratora; kai eis Christon Iesoun
          (ton) huion autou ton monogene, ton kurion hemon, ton
          gennethenta ek pneumatos hagiou kai Marias tes parthenou, ton
          epi Pontiou Pilatou staurothenta kai taphenta, te trite hemera
          anastanta ek (ton) nekron, anabanta eis tous ouranous,
          kathemenon en dexia tou patros hothen erchetai krinai zontas kai
          nekrous; kai eis pneuma hagion, hagian ekklesian, aphesin
          hamartion, sarkos anastasin.

          "I believe in God the Father Almighty and in Christ Jesus, his
          only-begotten Son, our Lord, born of the Holy Ghost and of Mary,
          the Virgin, who was crucified under Pontius Pilate and buried;
          on the third day he rose from the dead, ascended into heaven,
          sitteth on the right hand of the Father from whence he shall
          come to judge the quick and the dead; and in the Holy Ghost, the
          holy church, the remission of sins, the resurrection of the
          flesh."

  6. Earliest Appearance of the Legend of its Origin.

          The legend that this symbol was composed by the apostles,
          appears as early as the Explanatio symboli of Ambrose. The fact
          that the writer was aware of its being divided into twelve
          articles, perhaps indicates that the legend that each apostle
          had contributed one of them was already known. But Rufinus, who
          wrote later, knows only of a common composition of the Roman
          symbol by the apostles soon after Pentecost and before the
          separation. This legend he refers to a traditio majoram. It
          doubtless existed as early as the beginning of the fourth
          century. Both Ambrose and Rufinus testify that the wording of
          this symbol was most scrupulously preserved in the Roman Church.
          The apostolic origin of this symbol is also attested by Jerome,
          by the Roman bishops Celestine I. (422-431), Sixtus III.
          (431-440), and Leo I. (440-461), by Vigilius of Thapsus, and in
          the Sacramentarium Gelasianum (cf. Caspari, ii. 108-109, note
          78, iii. 94-95; Hahn, § 46, note 163).

  7. Age of the Roman Symbol.

          The fact that Augustine in his eight expositions of the creed
          follows the Roman symbol, leaves no doubt that in the fourth
          century and in the first half of the fifth the Roman Church made
          extensive use in the redditio of a symbol identical with the one
          mentioned above, and allowed of absolutely no additions to it.
          Ambrose was certainly not the only one to protest against many
          antiheretical additions. The epistle of Marcellus to Julius
          shows that between the years 330 and 340 this symbol was the
          official one in use in Rome; but other testimonies like
          Novatian's tractate De trinitate (Hahn, § 7) and the fragments
          from the epistles and writings of Bishop Dionysius of Rome point
          with certainty to the middle of the third century. That the
          shorter Roman symbol as represented in the Epistle of Marcellus
          and in the Psalterium Æthelstani (Hahn, § 16; Caspari, iii.
          161-203), was already the predominant one in the Roman Church
          about the year 250, can by no means be doubted. But here a
          series of questions arises, the answers to which involve very
          complicated investigations and combinations: (1) How is the
          shorter Roman symbol related to the Western symbols which were
          used, between 250 and 500 (or 800), in the religious services of
          the provincial churches until they were superseded by the
          (Gallican) Symbolum apostolicum and the
          Nicæno-Constantinopolitan creed? (2) How is the shorter Roman
          symbol related to the longer (i.e., the Apostolicum as it is now
          known) from the time of Cæsarius, and why was it displaced by
          the latter? (3) When and where did the shorter symbol originate?
          (4) How is the shorter Roman symbol related to the Eastern,
          pre-Constantinopolitan symbols? (5) How is the shorter Roman
          symbol related to the different forms of the rule of faith which
          are known from the first three centuries? These five questions
          can be separated only in abstracto. A definite and separate
          answer to each of them is impossible. In what follows they will
          be discussed together and only a general answer attempted.

  8. Comparison of Western Symbols.

          In surveying the very numerous provincial and private
          confessions which remain from the Western Church, belonging to
          the period from the fourth to the sixth (seventh) century (cf.
          Hahn, 20-45; Caspari, ii., iii.; Kattenbusch, 59-215, 392 sqq.),
          six important observations may be made: (1) In the choice and
          arrangement of the single parts the confessions all exhibit the
          same fundamental type as the shorter Roman symbol. (2) The
          shorter a Western symbol is, the more closely it approaches the
          shorter Roman symbol. The shortest symbols of the provincial
          Churches of the West are almost, if not altogether, identical
          with it. (3) The later a Western symbol is, the more does it
          deviate by additions (hardly ever by omissions) from the shorter
          Roman. These additions are not of a directly polemical nature,
          but are to be regarded as completions and extensions held to be
          necessary in the interest of elucidation. Such additions by no
          means alter the fundamental character of the symbol, since they
          are not of a speculative dogmatic nature. (4) The majority of
          the additions which the Western symbols exhibit may be regarded
          as a kind of intermediate step between the shorter and longer
          Roman symbols. This consideration, however, is not so important
          as the fact that during the third and fourth centuries the great
          provincial Churches of the West produced different types. Four
          such types can be readily distinguished, the Italian, African,
          Gallican (including the Irish), and Spanish. As for the Gallican
          type, which is seen in our Apostolicum, it is characterized by
          such historical additions as are to be found in Oriental forms
          of faith or symbols (viz., "maker of heaven and earth,"
          "suffered," "died," "descended into hell"; "catholic"). In its
          final form the Gallican type is not in every respect the richest
          or the longest of the Western symbols, but it is so as to its
          historical contents. In this important respect the final form of
          the Gallican type has completely preserved the distinguishing
          features of the old Roman symbol. It exhibits the same brief and
          severe style, and, nevertheless, also preserves all the
          significant historical features which became attached to the
          Symbolum Romanum in the course of its history. The Gallican
          Apostolicum also exhibits the same classical elaboration and
          ecumenical tendency as its Roman copy. (5) The less any Church
          was influenced by the Roman, the more did its symbol differ from
          the shorter Roman. The symbols of the Gallican Church differ
          relatively much from it. (6) In reducing all Western symbols to
          one archetype, without regard to the differences, the shorter
          Roman symbol is obtained without difficulty. From these
          observations it may be inferred with certainty (a) that the
          shorter Roman symbol was the source of all Western confessions
          of faith; (b) that the longer Roman symbol practically proceeded
          from the other, though not at Rome, and as a result received
          also the same attributes, which originally belonged to the
          shorter symbol.

          The supposition is also justified that the shorter Roman symbol
          must have already existed before the middle of the third
          century, otherwise the facts that all Western Churches
          originally used this very symbol, and that, e.g., the African
          Church had already developed before the year 250 its special
          type on the basis of the Symbolum vetus Romanum can not be
          explained (cf. Cyprian in Hahn, §§ 28, 29). The Roman symbol
          must therefore have originated at least about the year 300; and
          this can be proved from the writings of Tertullian, as well as
          from a comparison of the shorter Roman symbol with the Eastern
          symbols, which are rich in additions, introductions, dogmatic
          remarks, etc., besides omissions. The Nicæno-Constantinopolitan
          creed made an end to this fluctuating state of the confession,
          and from about 430 superseded the other Eastern confessions, and
          to this day the Constantinopolitan creed has remained the symbol
          of the Byzantine Church.

  9. Assumption of an Asia Minor Original of the Roman Symbol.

          Considering the state of affairs which existed in the East till
          the middle of the fifth century, it is difficult to characterize
          the fundamental type of the Eastern symbols. But, in spite of
          the many deviations, there exists a certain affinity with the
          shorter Roman symbol, the acceptance of which was hindered by
          (1) the circumstance that the Christological section of the
          Roman symbol came into conflict with a Christological type
          already established; (2) by the desire to give fuller expression
          to the "higher" Christology in the creed. It was not till the
          time of the Arian controversy that fixed symbols in the East
          began to be formed. From an examination of the Rules of Faith,
          and the fragments of those rules and formula-like sentences
          which are now familiar as belonging to the Eastern half of the
          Church from the middle of the first to the middle of the third
          century, scholars like Caspari, Zahn, Loofs, and others have
          inferred that there must have existed an Eastern symbol or, to
          be more precise, a symbol from Asia Minor, to which the old
          Roman symbol was related as daughter or sister. The assumption
          rests principally, if not exclusively, on what is found in
          Clement of Alexandria, Irenæus, Justin, and Ignatius; and the
          inference drawn therefrom is that in the East there existed in
          the second century a fixed symbol, or, rather, many symbols,
          related to the Roman symbol but independent of it. At best the
          Roman symbol is contemporaneous with the Asiatic or Syrian; more
          probably it is later. Harnack, who formerly shared this view, is
          now of opinion that the fact that single sentences seem to be
          echoes of the symbol, or tally with it, offers no guaranty that
          they themselves derive from one symbol. Before any symbol
          existed God was "almighty"; Jesus Christ was called "the
          only-begotten son, our Lord"; he was proclaimed as "begotten by
          the Holy Ghost, born of the Virgin Mary," as having "suffered
          under Pontius Pilate," and as coming to "judge the quick and the
          dead." Without following the argument in refutation of the
          testimonies derived from early Fathers in detail, it can be
          stated that, while the existence of a primitive typical Eastern
          form up to a certain point is admitted, nevertheless it is
          insisted that the great feat of forming the symbol, and of
          therewith laying the foundation of all ecclesiastical symbols,
          remains the glory of the community at Rome. To this Roman symbol
          which is unhesitatingly to be traced back to about the middle of
          the second century, no doubt Tertullian refers (Hær., xxxvi.).
          Had a symbol been established in Rome at the time of the fierce
          struggle with Gnosticism and Marcionitism (about 145-190), it
          would have run differently. On the other hand, it is not
          advisable to go back too far beyond the middle of the second
          century.

  10. Summary.

          To sum up: The symbol originated in Rome about the middle of the
          second century. It was based upon the baptismal formula and on
          confessional formulas of a summarizing character (such as may be
          identified from the New Testament and from Ignatius, Justin, and
          Irenæus), which had been generally handed down, including
          Eastern formulas (Asia Minor, Syria), and was largely under the
          influence of the New Testament writings. In Rome itself the
          symbol was never altered. It made its way into the Western
          provinces from the end of the second century onward, without
          claiming to have been, in the strictest sense, composed by the
          apostles. This accounts for the different modifications in those
          provinces (whereas at Rome it was designated as apostolic in the
          strict sense of the word sometime between 250 and 350). Among
          these modifications, those became historically the most
          important which were derived from the primitive confessional
          formulas or mathema (i.e., substance of instruction) of the
          East; namely, "creator of heaven and earth," "suffered," "died,"
          "descended into hell," "life everlasting," besides the
          catholicam--these are just the modifications traceable in the
          Gallican symbols which issue in our Apostolicum--in addition,
          the conceptus, which is obscure in its origin and otherwise of
          little importance, and, most perplexing of all, the communionem
          sanctorum. In this connection may rightly be borne in mind the
          particularly close relations existing between southern Gaul and
          the East.

  11. The Old Roman Symbol Displaced.

          That the Roman Church after the beginning of the sixth century
          gradually allowed itself to be separated from and finally robbed
          of the symbol which it had previously guarded so faithfully, is
          a phenomenon not yet fully explained, although Caspari (ii. 114
          sqq.; iii. 201 sqq., 230 sqq.) has made some very important
          contributions toward a solution of the problem. What is most
          decisive is the fact that it was not the longer (Gallican)
          daughter recension which displaced the mother, but that at Rome
          from the beginning of the sixth century the
          Nicæno-Constantinopolitan symbol took the place of the shorter
          symbol in the traditio and redditio symboli, whereas in the
          baptismal questions the old Roman symbol still remained in use.
          The displacement of the old Roman symbol by the
          Constantinopolitan becomes very intelligible, when one considers
          the conditions of the time. The rule of the Ostrogoths in Italy
          brought the Church of Rome in dangerous proximity to Arianism,
          and, in order to emphasize its attitude with respect to this
          heresy, the Church felt compelled to adopt a more explicit, so
          to speak polemically formed, symbol. Then, again, when this
          necessity ceased to press on the Church, and a return to a
          simpler creed became possible, the old symbol had grown dim in
          memory; while the new Roman, which was in fact the Gallican, the
          Symbolum Apostolicum, recommended itself by its more complete
          form. The differences were overlooked, or else not regarded as
          considerable; and the legend which had invested the old symbol
          with a halo of glory awoke again around the new one, and again
          and for a long time became a power in the Church, till it was
          exploded in the age of the Renaissance and the Reformation.

  12. Interpretation of the Symbol.

          In interpreting the apostolic symbol historically, it must be
          remembered that those portions of the same which belonged to the
          old Roman confession must be explained from the theology of the
          later apostolic and postapostolic ages (not simply, as some
          claim, "according to the New Testament"). This explanation must
          take into consideration that the symbol is an elaborated
          baptismal formula and that in its primitive form it must
          therefore not be regarded as an expression of intrachurch
          polemics, but rather as a Christian confession, composed for the
          purpose of instructing in Christianity as distinguished from
          Judaism and heathenism. In the course of history the theological
          explanation of the symbol on the whole keeps pace with the
          general development of dogmatics and theology. But the
          distinction between theological rules of faith and a confession
          serving for Christian instruction remains in the consciousness
          of the West, and is characteristically reflected in the
          Explanationes symboli.

  13. Clauses not Found in the Old Roman Symbol.

          As concerns the expressions of the apostolic symbol which are
          not in the old Roman, it is necessary to ascertain when, where,
          and under what conditions they first appear. Of most of them it
          may be said that they are a natural explication of the ancient
          symbol, that they do not alter its character, that they contain
          only the common faith of the Church--even of the Church of the
          second century--and that at the end of the second century they
          were known in the West, though they had not yet found a stable
          place in any of the provincial symbols. Two only of the
          additions can not be so regarded, namely the phrases descendit
          ad inferos, in the second article, and sanctorum communionem in
          the third. But both additions, on account of their dubious
          meaning, must be allowed to be failures. Even in modern times
          they are explained quite differently by different parties in the
          Church (cf. Kattenbusch, i. 1 sqq.).

   Apostolic Brethren
          APOSTOLIC BRETHREN: A sect founded in northern Italy in the
          latter half of the thirteenth century by Gherardo Segarelli, a
          native of Alzano in the territory of Parma. He was of low birth
          and without education, applied for membership in the Franciscan
          order at Parma, and was rejected. Ultimately he resolved to
          devote himself to the restoration of what he conceived to be the
          apostolic manner of life. About 1260 he assumed a costume
          patterned after representations which he had seen of the
          apostles, sold his house, scattered the price in the
          market-place, and went out to preach repentance as a mendicant
          brother. He found disciples, and the new order of penitents
          spread throughout Lombardy and beyond it. At first the
          Franciscans and other churchmen only scoffed at Segarelli's
          eccentric ways; but about 1280 the Bishop of Parma threw him
          into prison, then kept him awhile in his palace as a source of
          amusement, and in 1286 banished him from the diocese. All new
          mendicant orders without papal sanction having been prohibited
          by the Council of Lyons in 1274, Honorius IV. issued a severe
          reprobation of the Apostolic Brethren in 1286, and Nicholas IV.
          renewed it in 1290. A time of persecution followed. At Parma in
          1294 four members of the sect were burned, and Segarelli was
          condemned to perpetual imprisonment. Six years later he was made
          to confess a relapse into heresies which he had abjured, and was
          burned in Parma July 18, 1300. A man of much greater gifts now
          took the lead of the sect. This was [501]Dolcino, the son of a
          priest in the diocese of Novara, and a member of the order since
          1291, an eloquent, enthusiastic utterer of apocalyptic
          prophecies. At the head of a fanatical horde, who were in daily
          expectation of seeing the judgment of God on the Church, he
          maintained in the mountainous districts of Novara and Vercelli a
          guerrilla warfare against the crusaders who had been summoned to
          put him down. Cold and hunger were still more dangerous enemies;
          and finally the remnant of his forces were captured by the
          bishop of Vercelli--about 150 persons in all, including Dolcino
          himself and his "spiritual sister," Margareta, both of whom,
          refusing to recant, were burned at the stake June 1, 1307. This
          was really the end of the sect's history. It is true that even
          later than the middle of the century traces of their activity
          are found, especially in northern Italy, Spain, and France; but
          these are only isolated survivals.

          The ideal which the Apostolic Brethren strove to realize was a
          life of supposed perfect sanctity, in complete poverty, with no
          fixed domicil, no care for the morrow, and no vows. It was a
          protest against the invasion of the Church by the spirit of
          worldliness, as well as against the manner in which the other
          orders kept their vows, particularly that of poverty. In itself
          the project might have seemed harmless enough, not differing
          greatly from the way in which other founders had begun. When the
          order was prohibited, however, the refusal to submit to
          ecclesiastical authority stamped its members as heretics.
          Persecution embittered their opposition; the Church, in their
          eyes, had fallen completely away from apostolic holiness, and
          become Babylon the Great, the persecutor of the saints. Their
          apocalyptic utterances and expectations are a link with the
          Joachimites (see [502]Joachim of Fiore); in fact, parallels to
          their teaching, mostly founded on literal interpretations of
          Scripture texts, may be found in many heretical bodies. They
          forbade the taking of oaths, apparently permitting perjury in
          case of need, and rejected capital punishment; their close
          intercourse with their "apostolic sisters" gave rise to serious
          accusations against their morals, though they themselves boasted
          of their purity, and considered the conquest of temptation so
          close at hand as especially meritorious.

   Apostolic Church Directory
          APOSTOLIC CHURCH DIRECTORY: A work of Egyptian origin, probably
          of the third century. It appears in early times to have had no
          fixed title, although it was generally received as apostolic.
          The title given above is a translation of that (Apostolische
          Kirchenordnung) used for it by Bickell, its first modern editor.
          It professes to have been delivered word for word by the
          apostles, whose names are given as John, Matthew, Peter, Andrew,
          Philip, Simon, James, Nathanael, Thomas, Cephas (!),
          Bartholomew, and Jude, the brother of James. John is represented
          as the first to speak and, after the apostles, Mary and Martha
          also say something. The precepts given by the apostles fall into
          two sections, one dealing with the moral and the other with the
          ecclesiastical law (chaps. i.-xiv., and xvi.-xxx.). The first
          part is almost a literal transcription of the Didache (i.-iv.
          8), the observations at the close of it are borrowed from the
          Epistle of Barnabas (xxi. 2-4, xix. 11). The precepts relating
          to ecclesiastical organization deal with the choice of bishops
          and with presbyters, lectors, deacons, widows, lay people, and
          deaconesses. The canon referring to deacons occurs twice, in
          chaps. xx. and xxii., one being apparently a later insertion.

          The work was evidently written for a very small community. It
          imposes on the clergy limitations in regard to marriage which go
          far for that period. The section on deaconesses is interesting,
          in regard to both the foundation and the regulations of the
          institution. A wider field of activity is assigned to the lector
          than one is accustomed to; but no minor orders in the later
          sense are known, nor is there any approach to metropolitan
          organization. These primitive traits induced Harnack to attempt
          to distinguish two sources belonging to the second century,
          represented by chaps. xvi.-xxi., and xxii.-xxviii.; but this is
          unnecessary, as primitive customs persisted for a long time in
          certain parts of the Church.

          Books vii. and viii. (§ 3).

          The Canons (§ 4).

  1. Origin and History.

          Apostolic Constitutions and Canons is the name applied to an
          ancient collection of ecclesiastical precepts. The Constitutions
          profess to be regulations for the organization of the Church put
          forth by the apostles themselves and published to the faithful
          by Clement of Rome. In reality they are of Syrian origin, and
          were composed by a cleric from older sources in the latter half
          of the fourth century. They consist of eight books. The
          eighty-five Canons have the form of synodal decisions, and
          proceeded from the same source not much later. The fate of the
          two collections, so nearly allied in their origin, has been
          different. The Constitutions can never have been received
          outside of a narrow circle. They were considered spurious even
          in an extremely uncritical age, and thus never came as a whole
          into any of the great collections of ecclesiastical law in the
          East, though a part of the eighth book is frequently met with in
          these. They were unknown in the West until the sixteenth
          century, at which time neither Baronius nor Bellarmine made any
          attempt to vindicate their authenticity, though Anglican
          theologians took a great interest in them and frequently upheld
          their apostolic origin. The Canons, on the other hand, were
          generally received as genuine, included in many collections of
          Church law, and translated into several Oriental languages; to
          this day they stand at the beginning of the canonical system of
          the Eastern Church. The first fifty were made known to the West
          by Dionysius Exiguus (d. before 544), from whom they passed into
          a number of Latin collections, e.g., the pseudo-Isidorian
          Decretals, the Decretum Gratiani, and the Decretals of Gregory
          IX.

  2. The Constitutions, Books i.-vi.

          The criticism of the Constitutions was placed upon secure
          foundations for the first time when their sources were
          definitely assigned--the first six books (by Lagarde) to the
          Didascalia, the seventh to the Didache, and the eighth to the
          writings of Hippolytus of Rome. The first of these sources is a
          constitution of the third century, written by a bishop of
          Coele-Syria and attributed by him to the twelve apostles. Its
          unique value lies in the fact that it gives a picture down to
          the minutest details, of the life of a Christian community of
          the third century. The daily life of the individual and the
          family, the public worship, the wide practical charity and the
          strict moral discipline, the relation of the Church to the State
          and to the surrounding world, in science, art, and
          literature--all this is vividly depicted in the Didascalia. It
          throws a great deal of light on the origin of the order of
          deaconesses. Some things are peculiar; thus the New Testament
          canon includes, besides the four canonical Gospels, that of
          Peter and probably that according to the Hebrews, and some
          apocryphal Acta in addition to the canonical Acts. Striking
          characteristics are the friendly tone toward the Jews, in
          contrast with a hostile feeling toward the Jewish Christians;
          apparently the author was at the head of a community of Gentile
          Christians, and found that a neighboring Jewish-Christian
          community had a greater influence upon his flock than he
          approved. Ascetic directions in regard to mastery over the flesh
          are entirely wanting.

  3. Books vii. and viii.

          The first thirty-two chapters of the seventh book of the
          Constitutions are a mere recasting of the Didache. Noteworthy
          liturgical prayers (xxxiii.-xxxviii.) and directions as to
          baptism (xxxix.-xlv.) follow; the baptismal creed in chapter
          xli. played a not unimportant part in the councils of the fourth
          century. The eighth book is a compilation from various sources.
          Chapters i. and ii. contain an independent treatise on the
          charismata, which, since Hippolytus is known to have written on
          this subject, is supposed with great probability to be his. With
          chap iv. begins a liturgical directory which is ascribed
          directly to the apostles; chaps. v.-xv. form the well-known
          "Clementine" liturgy. Achelis has tried to demonstrate that the
          source of this part is the Egyptian church directory, which in
          its turn is derived from the Canones Hippolyti (preserved in an
          Arabic version). If this theory is correct, this part of the
          eighth book also would be ultimately due to Hippolytus. The
          Egyptian directory was a Greek work of the third century, which
          is preserved only in the Oriental versions. In opposition to
          Achelis, Funk, of Tübingen, maintained that the Apostolic
          Constitutions were the original work, the Egyptian directory
          derived from them, and the Canones Hippolyti from that again.
          The compiler of the Constitutions acted as an editor in dealing
          with his sources, attempting by revision and addition to fuse
          the various sources into a serviceable whole. He was an
          inhabitant of Syria, possibly a neighbor of the earlier author
          of the Didascalia. A connection can be traced between him and
          the pseudo-Ignatius, the Syrian forger who made twelve letters
          out of the seven genuine ones of Ignatius; certainly allied in
          time and thought with this man, he may have been identical with
          him. His date has been variously given, from c. 350 to c. 400,
          and can probably never be accurately determined, as the
          Constitutions have clearly been retouched later, especially the
          eighth book, which was the most used.

  4. The Canons.

          The Apostolic Canons grew up in the same surroundings, probably
          with the view of covering the lack of authenticity of the
          Constitutions by a new forgery. Their numbering varies; the
          division into eighty-five seems to be the oldest. Outside of the
          Constitutions, their sources are the decrees of the Dedication
          Synod of Antioch in 341 and other councils. Canon lxxxv. is the
          interesting Bible canon of both the Old and New Testaments,
          which omits the Apocalypse, but includes the two Clementine
          epistles and the Constitutions as Scripture.

          Information as to other Oriental writings more or less connected
          with the Constitutions and their sources may be found in W.
          Riedel, Die Kirchenrechtsquellen des Patriarchats Alexandrien
          (Leipsic, 1900), which treats among others the Thirty Traditions
          of the Apostles, the Arabic Didascalia, and a version of this,
          the Ethiopic Didascalia--a comparatively late work which has
          nothing to do with the Syriac Didascalia, but is probably
          related to the Testamentum Jesu Christi. An Oriental corpus, the
          Clementina, consists of the Testamentum, the Apostolic and
          Egyptian directories, an extract from the Constitutions, and the
          Apostolic Canons. It is divided into eight books by the Arabic
          and Syriac copyists. The title and introduction are taken from
          the Constitutions, to which the Clementina was intended as a
          supplement.

  1. New Testament Statements and Allusions.

          The Apostolic Council is the common designation of the meeting
          described in Acts xv. It took place in 51 or 52 A.D., between
          the missionary journey of Paul and Barnabas and that of Paul
          alone, and marks a distinct stage in the proclamation of the
          apostles' message to the Gentile world; viz., the recognition of
          the right of the Gentiles to a place in the Christian community,
          without subjection to the Mosaic law. Interest in Luke's report
          of the proceedings is increased by the fact that Paul himself
          refers to the Council in Gal. ii. 1-10 from a controversial
          standpoint. The comparison of the two accounts has led some
          recent theologians to assert that the account in Acts is
          essentially different from that of Paul, and that the author of
          Acts has made the facts fit the views which he takes of the
          whole period (see below, [503]§ 5). In earlier time this council
          was the special point used as a fulcrum for the attempt of the
          Tübingen school to overthrow the received tradition as to the
          history and literature of the time. Although the objections of
          Baur, especially as to the irreconcilability of Acts xv. and
          Gal. ii., have few extreme representatives nowadays, yet their
          results are seen in recent attempts to deny the unity of the
          Acts, regarding the book as a composite of various sources,
          which do not always agree in material and in tendency.

  2. Luke the Author of the Account in Acts.

          In the following treatment of the Apostolic Council the Book of
          Acts is assumed to be the work of Luke of Antioch, the companion
          of Paul, who (xvi. 10 sqq.) narrates in the first person; and
          the events detailed in chap. xv. are believed to be given partly
          from his own knowledge, partly from the testimony of the
          participants. There is no a priori reason to suppose that for
          chap. xv., or generally for any part of the Antiochian-Pauline
          period, Luke was working over written authorities; he
          undoubtedly had seen the Jerusalem letter (verses 23-29), but
          probably gives it here freely from memory. For a long time
          Paul's most trusted coadjutor, he would naturally enter
          intelligently into the Pauline attitude; and this is precisely
          what is found in his presentation of Paul's labors. His
          standpoint is that found in the Pauline theodicy of Rom.
          ix.-xi., which excludes any tendency contrary to history, and
          allows the writer to consider historical facts in a perfectly
          objective manner. One may thus expect with confidence to find
          Luke's report of the Council historically accurate. Of this
          accuracy Paul's expressions must of course serve as a criterion;
          since, however, Paul is not, like Luke, writing from the
          standpoint of general history, but to enforce a special point of
          dispute, Luke's account must be taken as the basis of any later
          treatment professing to be historical.

  3. Occasion for the Council.

          It is learned from Luke's account that some time after Paul and
          Barnabas had returned to Antioch from their missionary journey,
          there appeared certain Jewish Christians who taught the hitherto
          unheard-of doctrine that converts from heathenism could not be
          saved without circumcision, thus denying the equality prevailing
          for some ten years (or since Acts xi. 20) between the
          circumcised and uncircumcised members of the Church of Antioch.
          This caused great disturbance among the Gentile Christians,
          whose liberty was threatened, and Paul and Barnabas opposed it
          strongly and were deputed to lay the question before the
          apostles and elders in Jerusalem. This mission implies no doubt
          in their minds of their own position, which had been approved
          all along; but they wished to be positively assured that they
          were in harmony with the source of their Christianity, for the
          quieting of their own minds and the suppression of further
          attacks from the Judaizing party. Luke gives with care the
          serious discussion which led up to the decision. The Jerusalem
          community at first received the tidings of Gentile conversions
          not with unqualified joy; some Pharisaic members of the Church
          put forward a definite demand that the Gentile Christians should
          be bound to the observance of the Mosaic law. It is to be
          noticed, however, that this demand was not put forward, as at
          Antioch, on the theory that they could not otherwise be saved.
          The practical demand was the same, and was so strongly pressed
          that the decision was postponed to another meeting, in which
          again a long discussion took place without result. Since the
          extreme thesis of the disturbers at Antioch was not put forward
          here, there must have been other weighty grounds which induced
          no inconsiderable portion of the Church to press for the
          subjection of the Gentiles to the Mosaic law--apparently based
          on the idea that the law was God's ordinance for the lives of
          men far more universally than merely among the Jews.

  4. The Outcome. Four Prohibitions.

          It was Peter, the head of the Church of the Circumcision, who
          silenced this party by the unequivocal declaration of the
          principle of salvation by grace alone through faith. He
          appealed, as to something they all knew, to the fact that God
          had long before proclaimed salvation by his ministry to
          Cornelius and his household; he declared that the people of God
          in Israel had not been able to bear the law as a means of
          salvation, but were equally dependent with the Gentiles upon
          divine grace, showing that this fundamental principle would be
          endangered if they insisted upon the observance of the law. This
          argument reduced the opposition to silence; no one was willing
          to attack the truth that salvation was to be obtained without
          the law through faith. The time was now ripe for Barnabas and
          Paul to show how God had attested their ministry by signs and
          wonders, which proved also their apostolic independence (cf. II
          Cor. xii. 12). The final verdict was rendered by James, showing
          that the prophets had foreshadowed the upbuilding of a Church
          without the law, and proposing instead of its enforcement to
          emphasize four prohibitions, which are connected with the rules
          laid down in Lev. xvii. and xviii. equally for the children of
          Israel and for the strangers sojourning among them, as also with
          those imposed by later Jewish tradition on the "proselytes of
          the gate"; they are possibly nothing but these rules in the form
          in which they were observed among proselytes in the apostolic
          times, in the districts here affected (Syria and Cilicia). They
          are derived originally from the Mosaic law, and forbid what to
          the Jewish ethical consciousness was highly offensive. Neither
          of these points is made, however, but they are forbidden as
          things in themselves morally reprehensible--their prohibition is
          necessary in order to separate Gentile morality from Gentile
          immorality and superstition. By the word "fornication" (Gk.
          porneia) is signified the unrestricted sexual intercourse which
          was practically tolerated in the heathen world. The words "to
          abstain from meats offered to idols" refer to both private and
          public meals on the flesh of the victims of sacrifices, which
          connected the social life of the people with pagan worship. The
          prohibition of "blood" and "things strangled," while not so
          easily understood, may be taken to stamp with disapproval the
          habits in regard to food which prevailed among barbarous tribes,
          but were rejected by the more civilized Greeks and Romans,
          though they must have been known among the populations to whom
          the first recipients of the letter belonged. In a word, the
          whole purpose of the decree was to mark off by a sharp line of
          division the life of the Gentile Christians from that of the
          heathen around them.

  5. Alleged Contradiction between Acts and Gal. ii.

          The account in the Acts has been assailed by numerous critics as
          a more or less consciously biased presentation of the real
          story, as it may be taken from Gal. ii. The accusations are
          mainly these: the account in Acts minimizes the fundamental
          opposition which existed between Paul and the Jerusalem Church
          by ascribing to the latter a Pauline standpoint which it had
          not; the account gives as a result of the Council a limitation
          of the Gentiles' liberty and equal title to which Paul could
          never have consented; in defiance of history, it attributes to
          Paul a position of subordination to the Jerusalem apostles. The
          first point scarcely needs further discussion after what has
          been said. The Pauline expressions in Gal. ii. must be taken in
          connection with the explanatory preface in chap. i. His Galatian
          opponents asserted that his preaching to the Gentiles needed
          correction and completion, supporting this by the statement that
          he had formerly subordinated himself to the Twelve. He appeals
          to the superhuman origin of his mission and the fact that he had
          sought no confirmation of his gospel from men, not even from the
          Twelve (Gal. i. 11-20). But with verse 21 another point of view
          begins; the remaining verses are written to demonstrate that no
          relation existed between him and the Palestinian Christianity,
          the older apostles, which would give his opponents any right to
          appeal to them against him. When in Gal. ii. 1 he mentions going
          up to Jerusalem fourteen years later, it is in order to
          demonstrate that after so long a time the original concord
          remains undisturbed. The situation is thus exactly that
          described in Acts xv. What Paul designates "that gospel which I
          preach among the Gentiles" is the very thing opposed by the
          disturbers and brought up in Jerusalem. In both cases
          uncertainty exists as to the position of Jerusalem toward it,
          and certainty is sought. In both Paul appears with Barnabas; and
          if he mentions that he took with him Titus, who was
          uncircumcised (meaning thereby to test the attitude of the
          Jerusalem Church toward Gentile Christians), Luke also relates
          that certain of the Gentile converts from Antioch were sent with
          him. Paul is stating facts to repel a personal attack on
          himself; Luke mentions the matter in its bearing on the history
          of the Church as a whole. Thus there was no need to mention in
          the Acts the revelation which (in addition to the desire of the
          community) decided Paul's journey, while Paul speaks of it
          apparently to emphasize the importance of the proceeding. That
          Paul omits any notice of the decree is not surprising when one
          considers that its purpose was not in any way to limit the
          freedom of the Gentiles from the law, and that he had no motive
          to enter on the subject here. On the other hand, he does narrate
          something which Luke omits, in verses 6-10. Certain prominent
          leaders, especially the three "pillars," recognizing the grace
          given to him, explicitly agreed that he and Barnabas should go
          to the heathen, and they to the circumcision. By this he means
          to confirm what must have been denied in Galatia--that his
          independent position involved no breach with Jerusalem, but had
          been distinctly sanctioned by the leaders of the Church there.
          Luke might have been expected to mention this less public
          discussion and agreement, of which he must have known, and, as a
          matter of fact, Acts xv. 4, 12, 26 may be taken to refer
          indirectly to it; not to mention that, according to his
          narrative alone, it would seem likely that the leaders had had
          their minds settled as to the position of Paul and Barnabas, and
          in some such way as Gal. ii. describes. The same process of
          intelligent comparison will also show that the account of the
          conflict at Antioch in Gal. ii. 11 sqq. is by no means (as has
          been frequently asserted) irreconcilable with the narrative of
          the Acts.

  6. Later History of the Decision of the Council.

          A word must be said about the later history of the decree.
          Originally it was addressed to that part of the Gentile
          Christians who had been in relation with Jerusalem. On his own
          motion Paul extended it to other Gentile communities already
          existing. Neither his own writings nor the Acts show that he
          enforced it upon communities formed later as a decree of the
          Jerusalem Council; but in regard at least to the first two
          points, the manner in which they are referred to in I Cor. v.,
          vi., viii.-x. and in Rev. ii. shows that the prohibition was
          held to be of universal obligation among the Gentile Churches;
          and in the second century they played an important part in
          connection with the Gnostic controversy. Singularly enough, no
          trace of the other two prohibitions is found either in apostolic
          or in subapostolic times; if the view of them given above is
          correct, this would be explained by the fact that there was no
          need to enforce them in the civilized Hellenic world. Later
          passages in Tertullian (Apol., ix.), Minucius Felix (Octavius,
          xii.), and the Clementine Homilies (vii. 4, 8) and Recognitions
          (iv. 36), point to an avoiding of blood even in cooked meats,
          which must have been based on a misunderstanding of the decree.

          priests set apart by the laying on of hands. The Greek, Roman
          Catholic, and Anglican Churches maintain that this succession is
          essential to the validity of sacramental ministrations, and
          allow no one not thus ordained to minister in their churches.
          The last-named body asserts its possession by all three; the
          Roman Catholic concedes it to the Greek but not to the Anglican;
          while the Greeks regard its possession by either of the other
          two as at best exceedingly doubtful. See [512]Episcopacy;
          [513]Ordination; [514]Polity.

   Apostolici
          APOSTOLICI (called by themselves Apotactici, "Renuntiants"):
          heretical sect of the third and fourth centuries which renounced
          private property and marriage. They existed in Asia Minor and
          are mentioned by Epiphanius (Hær., lxi.). They accepted as
          Scripture the apocryphal Acts of Andrew and of Thomas.

   Appeals To the Pope
          APPEALS TO THE POPE: Appeals from lower officials or courts,
          which, considered as an ordinary process of law, with effect of
          suspension and devolution, may be based upon the pope's capacity
          of bishop and metropolitan, or upon his supposed primacy over
          the entire Catholic world. Those of the former class have
          nothing peculiar about them. As concerns the latter class, the
          third and fourth canons of the Council of Sardica (343) do not,
          as asserted by Roman Catholic canonists, recognize such an
          appellate jurisdiction; and no such jurisdiction existed
          earlier. The council indeed lays down the law that in case of
          the deposition of a bishop the matter may be referred to the
          pope, who may either decline to act (in which case the
          deposition holds good), or may order an investigation by
          neighboring bishops and certain specially appointed priests.
          But, apart from the fact that the Council of Sardica is not
          recognized as ecumenical, and that its decrees were long ago
          known to have been interpolated to bring them into harmony with
          the Nicene canons, every true appeal presupposes a review of the
          formalities and a decision on the validity of the grounds for
          the lower court's sentence, neither of which is mentioned in the
          Sardican canons. The claim by the Roman See of a supreme
          judicial power was only made possible by the victory of the
          orthodox party, always represented by Rome, over Arianism, and
          the imperial decision (380) that the faith of the Roman pontiff
          was the standard, and that he should have precedence over all
          other bishops. This claim was first made by Innocent I.
          (402-417) in his letter to Victricius of Rouen; attempts to
          enforce it met with the determined opposition of the primates,
          and failed until a firm foundation for them was laid under Leo
          I. by a law of the emperor Valentinian III. in 445.

          The Roman view is set forth in more than one passage of the
          pseudo-Isidorian decretals. These assert that, in conformity
          with the decrees of Sardica, bishops may appeal to Rome in all
          causes, and that the more serious ones must be decided by the
          Roman See, not by the bishops; and then that not only in such
          cases, but in all, and by any injured person, appeal may be made
          to the pope. These claims were in accord with the ideas of the
          twelfth century, and gave definite form to the concurrent
          jurisdiction of the pope, by which he might either immediately
          or through his legates decide or call up questions otherwise
          belonging to the ordinary. This is not the same thing as the
          appellate jurisdiction; but the conceptions belonging to the
          latter are touched by the assertion that in cases where failure
          of justice occurs in the secular courts, recourse may be had
          from any tribunal to the Church, that is, eventually to the
          curia. Although Alexander III. (1159-81) had admitted that
          appeals from civil tribunals, while customary, were not in
          accordance with strict legal principles, Innocent III.
          (1198-1216) affirmed the principle that the Church had the right
          to take measures against any sin, and thus against denial of
          justice by secular courts. A reaction against the abuse of
          appeals to Rome was evidenced in Germany by the "Golden Bull"
          [issued by the emperor Charles IV. in 1356; for text cf. O.
          Harnack, Das Kurfürsten-Kollegium, Giessen, 1883], which forbade
          them to be made from secular tribunals; by the Concordat of
          Constance (1418); and by the thirty-first session of the Council
          of Basel, to which corresponds the twenty-sixth section of the
          Pragmatic Sanction of 1439. The Concordat established the
          principle that appeals should be decided not in Rome, but by
          judices in partibus; and this provision was repeated in the
          latter two documents, which also forbade appeals per saltum and
          before the definitive sentence of the lower tribunal. The
          Council of Trent (sessions 13, chaps. 1-3, and 24, chap. 20
          [held in 1551 and 1563]) decreed that only causæ majores should
          be taken to Rome, the others being decided by judices synodales,
          papal delegates so called because their nomination was left to
          the diocesan and provincial synods. When it appeared that these
          bodies did not act successfully, Pope Benedict XIV. (1740-58)
          transferred the nomination to bishops and chapters (judices
          prosynodales) by the constitution Quamvis paternæ of 1741. At
          present the bishops receive faculties enabling them to delegate
          these nominees in the pope's name for a certain number of years.
          Appeals which do go to Rome are referred to two congregations,
          that of the council and that of bishops and regulars.

          In modern times, even earlier than the period of the emperor
          Joseph II. (1765-90), both Catholic and Protestant governments
          have either abolished these appeals or very strictly limited
          them; but these limitations are considered by the curia as only
          de facto; not de jure, and the extensive medieval claims are
          still upheld in theory.

   Appel, Theodore
          APPEL, THEODORE: German Reformed clergyman; b. at Easton, Pa.,
          Apr. 30,1823. He was educated at Marshall College, Mercersburg,
          Pa. (B.A., 1842), and at the German Reformed Seminary in the
          same town (1845). He was tutor in Greek in Marshall College in
          1842-45, and pastor of German Reformer churches at Cavetown, Md.
          (1845-51), and Mercersburg, Pa. (1851-53). He also held the
          professorship of mathematics at Marshall College from 1851 to
          1853, and was professor of mathematics, physics, and astronomy
          at Franklin and Marshall College from 1853 to 1877, while from
          1878 to 1886 he was superintendent of home missions in the
          Reformed Church. He is secretary of the Board of Visitors of the
          Reformed Theological Seminary and holds a similar office on the
          Board of Home and Foreign Missions of the Reformed Church. From
          1878 to 1886 he edited the Reformed Missionary Herald and from
          1889 to 1893 the Reformed Church Messenger. He retired from
          active life in 1897. In theology he adheres to the Mercersburg
          type of doctrine of the German Reformed Church. In addition to
          numerous contributions to periodicals, he has written College
          Recollections (Reading, Pa., 1886); The Beginnings of the
          Theological Seminary of the Reformed Church (Philadelphia,
          1886); and The Life and Work of Rev. John W. Nevin (1889). He
          has likewise edited Nevin's lectures on the history of the
          English language (Lancaster, Pa., 1895).

   Appleton, Jesse
          APPLETON, JESSE: American Congregationalist; b. at New Ipswich,
          N. H., Nov. 17, 1772; d. at Brunswick, Me., Nov. 12, 1819. He
          was graduated at Dartmouth 1792; ordained minister at Hampton,
          N. H., Feb., 1797; chosen second president of Bowdoin College,
          1807. During the greater part of his term he acted as professor
          of philosophy and rhetoric and was pastor of the Congregational
          Church at Brunswick. His theological lectures and academic
          addresses, and a selection from his sermons, with memoir, were
          published at Andover (2 vols., 1836).

   Apponius
          APPONIUS, ap-pO´ni-Us: The author of an exposition of the Song
          of Solomon. He names himself in his preface, addressed to the
          presbyter Armenius, but neither the time nor the place of his
          activity can be determined with certainty. An approximation to
          his date may be reached by means of the facts that he mentions
          Macedonius, Photinus, and Bonosus among heretics, and that Bede
          (d. 735) quotes him, which places him between the beginning of
          the fifth century and the middle of the seventh--probably nearer
          the beginning than the end of this period, since he does not
          mention Nestorius and Eutyches among his heretics. Mai
          identified Armenius with the personage of that name associated
          with Agnellus, and accordingly fixed the middle of the sixth
          century as Apponius's date. His insistence on the position of
          Peter as vicar of Christ has been thought to point to Rome or
          its vicinity as the place of his residence. His interpretation
          of the Canticles is entirely mystical and spiritual, regarding
          it as an exposition of the relations of God with his Church.

   Apse
          APSE (APSIS): The semicircular or semioctagonal enclosure with
          which the choir of the older Christian churches generally
          terminates. The ground-plan of this enclosure is an arc, on the
          chord of which the altar is raised, while the bishop's throne is
          placed in the center, against the wall, with rows of benches for
          the clergy on both sides, sometimes one row above the other
          (apsides gradatæ). In the Roman basilica, or hall of justice,
          which in numerous cases was actually turned into a Christian
          church with very slight modifications, while its ground-plan
          formed the starting-point for all Christian church architecture,
          the exterior form of the building was perfectly rectangular, and
          the apse, with its seats for the magistrate and the officers of
          the court, was formed internally.

          There are still churches extant on this plan, and they are the
          oldest; such as the Sta. Croce in Gerusalemme in Rome, and
          several others in Africa and Asia Minor, all of the third
          century. In churches of the fifth century, such as Sant'
          Apollinare in Classe at Ravenna, etc., the apse has generally
          become visible also in the exterior form; and not only the
          choir, but also the aisles, terminate in apses. In St. Sophia in
          Constantinople, and in churches built after that model, the
          transepts are provided with apses; and, in some few cases in
          Germany, such as the Church of Reichenau on the Lake of
          Constance, the choir has apses at both ends. See
          [517]Architecture, Ecclesiastical.

   Aquarii
          AQUARII, ?-cwê´ri-ai ("Water People"): The name given by
          Philastrius (Hær., lxxvii.; cf. Augustine, Hær., lxiv.;
          Prædestinatus, lxiv.) to certain Christians who used water
          instead of wine in the [518]Lord's Supper.

   Aquaviva, Claudio
          AQUAVIVA, ??´´cwa-vî´va, CLAUDIO: Fifth general of the Jesuits;
          b. at Naples Sept. 14, 1543; d. at Rome Jan. 31, 1615. He
          studied at Rome, joined the order in 1567, and was chosen its
          general in 1581. He showed himself a highly capable ruler in the
          midst of difficulties both within the order and without. The
          Spanish Jesuits organized a revolt against him and had the
          support of the Inquisition, King Philip II., and Pope Clement
          VIII., but he ultimately established himself all the firmer from
          the very attacks which were intended to overthrow him. In the
          dispute between the Dominicans and the Jesuits following the
          publication of Molina's book on free will (see [519]Molina) he
          supported the latter skilfully and successfully. It was under
          Aquaviva's leadership that the order reached its assured
          position in the world. He wrote Industriæ pro superioribus ad
          curandos animæ morbos (Florence, 1600), and compiled the oldest
          Ratio studiorum (Rome, 1586) and the Directorium exercitiorum
          sancti Ignatii (1591). His letters addressed to the members of
          the order are in the Epistolæ proepositorum generalium
          societatis Jesu, Antwerp, 1635, and have been printed in other
          editions.

   Aquila
          AQUILA, ac´wi-la: 1. Translator of the Old Testament into Greek;
          see [520]Bible Versions, A, I., 2, § 1.

          2. A Jewish Christian from Pontus, who was intimately connected
          with Paul, and is always mentioned in connection with his wife,
          Prisca (so in Paul according to the best readings) or Priscilla
          (Luke), whose name is usually put first. When the first epistle
          to the Corinthians was written the pair lived at Ephesus (I Cor.
          xvi. 19), and their house was a meeting-place for the
          congregation there. It may be inferred that they were well known
          to the Corinthians, probably from a residence at Corinth, and
          this is confirmed by the Acts, according to which Aquila and
          Priscilla, being driven from Rome by the order of Claudius,
          settled at Corinth shortly before Paul's arrival there
          (xviii.1-3). If this expulsion is connected with disturbances
          among the Roman Jews due to Christianity, it is not impossible
          that the pair were already Christians, and this view is favored
          by the fact that Paul stayed with them. From Corinth they went
          to Ephesus with Paul (Acts xviii. 18), and here Apollos was
          instructed in Christianity by them (xviii. 26). From Rom. xvi.
          3-5 they seem to have been in Rome when that epistle was
          written; but this passage is thought by some to be out of place
          and properly to belong to an epistle directed to the Ephesians;
          II Tim. iv. 19 puts them again at Ephesus. According to later
          tradition, Aquila became bishop of Heraclea; according to
          another tradition, he suffered martyrdom with his wife (cf. ASB.
          July 8).

   Aquila Kaspar
          AQUILA (ADLER) KASPAR: Lutheran; b. at Augsburg Aug. 7, 1488; d.
          at Saalfeld (65 m. s.w. of Leipsic), Thuringia, Nov. 12, 1560.
          He studied at Leipsic (1510) and, after 1513, at Wittenberg. In
          1515-16 he appears to have been chaplain to Franz von Sickingen
          during his campaigns against Worms and Metz; from 1517 to 1521
          he officiated as pastor at Jengen, near Augsburg, where,
          influenced by the writings of Luther, he became an adherent of
          the Reformation. In Jan., 1521, he went to Wittenberg to obtain
          his master's degree. During the next two years (1522-23) he was
          again with Sickingen; then he returned to his home, and was
          imprisoned at Dillingen by the bishop of Augsburg (Sept., 1523).
          He was soon liberated, however, and went to Wittenberg, where he
          rendered Luther valuable aid in the translation of the Old
          Testament. Through Luther's influence he became minister at
          Saalfeld (1527) and was present at the Diet of Augsburg in 1530.
          In 1548 he published a virulent attack against his former
          friend, Agricola, because of the latter's support of the Interim
          of 1548. The emperor set a price on his head and Aquila sought
          refuge with the counts of Henneberg. In 1550 he became dean of
          the Collegiate Institute at Schmalkald but returned two years
          later to Saalfeld.

   Aquileia, Patriarchate and Synods
          AQUILEIA, ??´´cwi-lê´y??, PATRIARCHATE AND SYNODS: Aquileia, or
          Aglar, a town at the north end of the Adriatic (45 m. e.n.e. of
          Venice), was originally a Roman outpost against the Celts and
          Istrians and was a place of commercial importance as early as
          the reign of Augustus. Tradition ascribes the founding of its
          church to Mark the Evangelist, who is said to have come from
          Rome and consecrated St. Hermagoras (alleged to have died as a
          martyr) as its first bishop. Somewhat less legendary is the
          tradition that its bishop, Helarus or Hilarius, suffered
          martyrdom there about 285. Its bishop, Valerianus (369-388), the
          fellow combatant of Ambrose against the Arians, appears as
          metropolitan, and presided at the first Aquileian provincial
          council (381), which was attended by thirty-two bishops from
          Upper Italy, Gaul, and Africa; it excommunicated and deposed the
          Illyric bishop Palladius who leaned toward Arianism. When the
          Lombards invaded Upper Italy, the metropolitan Paul transferred
          his seat from Aquileia to the isle of Grado (568). The Aquileian
          metropolitans riding there refused to acknowledge the fifth
          ecumenical council of 553, convened by Justinian I., and
          remained in this schismatic opposition nearly 150 years. An
          effort of Gregory the Great to bring them back to the Roman
          Church failed, since the synod convened by the metropolitan
          Severus (586-607) at Grado (c. 600) still refused to acknowledge
          the council. The successor of Severus, Candidianus (died c.
          612), accepted the catholic orthodox tradition, but the schism
          continued, nevertheless. Under the protection of the Lombards a
          number of schismatic antibishops were created, who resumed their
          seat in Aquileia and took the title of Patriarch, and the
          bishops of Grado soon followed their example. The controversy
          did not cease when in 698 the Aquileian Patriarch Peter (induced
          by Sergius I. of Rome) abjured his schism. On the contrary, both
          patriarchates, that of Aquileia and that of Grado, maintained
          themselves side by side till the middle of the eighteenth
          century. Repeated efforts of the popes (such as that of Leo IX.
          by the bulla circumscriptionis of 1053) to effect a
          reconciliation were unsuccessful. When Nicolaus V. in 1451
          abolished the patriarchate of Grado, and established one for
          Venice, the incumbents of the Aquileian see were placed in a
          difficult position; both Venice and Austria, to whose territory
          Aquileia belonged, as well as Udine and Cividale, where the
          Aquileians had commonly resided since the early Middle Ages,
          obtained the right of appointment. The difficulties were finally
          adjusted 300 years later by Benedict XIV., who abolished the
          Aquileian patriarchate by the bull Injunctum (1751) and founded
          in its place two archbishoprics, one at Udine for Venetian
          Friuli to be filled by Venice, and the other at Görz for
          Austrian Friuli to be filled by Vienna. Several synods more or
          less noteworthy were called by the Aquileian patriarchs during
          the Middle Ages. One at Friuli (Forum Julii) in 796 under
          Paulinus (787-802), the friend of Alcuin and theological
          counselor of Charlemagne, declared against the Greek dogma of
          the procession of the Holy Spirit. There were several in the
          fourteenth century (1305, 1311, 1339, etc.). The last of
          importance met in Cividale in 1409 at the call of Gregory XII.
          in opposition to the reform-council at Pisa.

   Aquileian Creed
          AQUILEIAN CREED: The creed of the Church of Aquileia as given by
          the Aquileian Rufinus (Expositio symboli apostolorum, MPL, xxi.)
          forms a parallel to the older, shorter Roman baptismal formula
          with three interesting variants: (1) At the end of the first
          article it adds to Deo Patre omnipotente the words invisibili et
          impassibili (probably as explanation against Patripassianism);
          (2) In the second article, between the words sepultus and tertia
          die resurrexit it puts a reference to Christ's descent into
          Hades (I Pet. iii. 19; Eph. iv. 9) by the words descendit ad
          inferna--the oldest catholic orthodox confession of this article
          of faith, since the synod at Sirmium in 358 and Nicæa 359 which
          mention the same fact were semi-Arian; (3) In article iii. it
          inserts hujus before carnis resurrectionem, thus emphasizing the
          identity of the resurrection-body with the earthly body of man.
          The creed of the ancient churches of Friuli published by B. M.
          de Rubeis (Dissertatio de liturgicis, Venice, 1754) from a
          scrutinium catechumenorum Forojuliense of the sixth century (cf.
          the text in Hahn, 43-44) differs from that of Rufinus, and the
          three characteristic formulas of the latter mentioned above, are
          wanting. One of these formulas at least, the descendit ad
          inferna is also found in the parallel text transmitted by
          Venantius Fortunatus (Expositio symboli, xi. 1), which must be
          regarded as an excerpt from the text of Rufinus (Hahn, 45-46).
          The Explanatio symboli of Bishop Nicetas (or Niceta), which has
          often been regarded as a parallel text to the Aquileian
          confession, has nothing to do with it, since the bishop in
          question had his see not at Romatiana (or Portus Romatianus)
          near Aquileia, but at Remesiana in Dacia (see [521]Nicetas of
          Remesiana).

                                      III. History.
                                      IV. Religion.

  I. Use of the Name:

          The root-meaning of the Semitic word is "dry" or "sterile"; as a
          noun it means "desert." (1) Old Testament Usage. The term occurs
          first as a place name, Jer. xxv. 24 (Isa. xiii. 20, where it is
          equivalent to "nomad," is exilic or later). In earlier passages
          it is simply "desert." Ezekiel (xxvii. 21) and the Chronicler
          (II Chron. xvii. 11; xxi. 16; xxii. 1; xxvi. 7; Neh. ii. 19; iv.
          7; vi. 1) use it as a national appellative. In the early parts
          of the Bible the Arabs are called Amalekites, Ishmaelites,
          Midianites, the Meonim (=Minæans, see [523]III. below), and the
          like. (2) New Testament Usage. In Acts ii. 11 the use
          corresponds to that of late passages in the Old Testament. The
          Arabia of Paul's retirement (Gal. i. 17), usually taken as the
          Syrian desert, is rather the Sinaitic peninsula (cf. Gal. iv.
          25). (3) Assyrian Usage. The inscriptions later than the ninth
          century B.C. contain frequent allusions to Arabs, but generally
          mean only those of the Syrian desert. With these contact was
          frequent. Tiglath Pileser III. invaded the peninsula, as did
          Esarhaddon. In earlier times the country was known to
          Babylonians as Magan, and is often mentioned. (4) The Arabic
          Usage. According to Nöldeke (Encyclopædia Biblica, i. 274) the
          term "Arab" was in early (pre-Christian?) use by the Arabs
          themselves as a general term denoting the inhabitants of the
          peninsula. It was so employed during Mohammed's lifetime, though
          several passages in the Koran apply the term to nomads as
          distinct from inhabitants of towns. (5) Greek Usage employs the
          word inexactly of the nomads of the Syrian desert, but Herodotus
          (ii. 11; iii. 107-113; iv. 39) means by "Arabia" the peninsula.
          (6) In the following discussion "Arabia" will mean only the
          peninsula south of a line drawn from the head of the Persian
          Gulf to the southeast extremity of the Mediterranean, thus
          excluding the region commonly known as the Syrian desert.

  II. Geography and Topography:

          Only the edges of the peninsula have been explored by Europeans.
          (For a history of exploration, cf. the chapter by Hommel in
          Hilprecht, Explorations in Bible lands, Philadelphia, 1903,
          691-752; D. G. Hogarth, The Penetration of Arabia, London,
          1904.) For information about the central regions dependence must
          be placed upon Arab geographers; "mostly unexplored" is Hommel's
          significant phrase (Hilprecht, 697). (1) Physical Features. The
          shape is that of a thick-legged boot, with the toe toward the
          east. The peninsula is about 1,400 miles in length by from 600
          to 1,200 in width. It consists of a narrow belt of fertile
          sea-plain around the east, south, and west sides, terminated by
          a chain of mountains, practically continuous, rising abruptly to
          a height of 4,000 to 10,000 feet, through which passes give
          access to a central plateau, which in its highest parts is 8,000
          feet above the sea. Arabia has no river system, only a system of
          wadies or valleys. In these, during the dry season, the waters
          sink below the surface to be found only by digging; and the
          waters of the interior, collected temporarily in the wadies,
          lose themselves in the sand. (2) Climate. Lying as Arabia does
          between 12° 40´ and 32° n. lat., its prevailing temperature is
          high, notwithstanding its elevation. The interior is also very
          dry, owing to the fact that the mountains intercept the moisture
          from the sea. Different parts of the coast region have a rainy
          season which differs curiously in time; Yemen (the southwestern
          corner) has its rains between June and September. Oman (the
          southeastern projection), between February and April, and
          Hadramaut (the southern coast district), between April and
          September. (3) The fringing sea-plain possesses great fertility;
          though generally untilled. The most of the interior plateau is
          desert, either of sand or of gravel and stone. But there are
          areas of surprising fertility, some of considerable extent, as
          is involved in the existence of the kingdoms owning sway over
          settled populations (see [524]III. below). A smaller area is
          under cultivation now than in early times owing to the decay of
          works of irrigation. (4) Fauna and Flora. The animal life as
          conditioned by the climate includes of course the camel; the
          lion, leopard, wolf, fox, hyena, and jackal are the beasts of
          prey and carrion; the antelope, gazelle, ibex, and hare are the
          game animals; the jerboa represents the rodents; and the marmot
          and ostrich are natives. The qualities of the Arab horse (not a
          native) will be at once recalled. The flora is characterized by
          the date-palm, fig-tree, aromatic herbs, and the coffee-berry.
          (5) Inhabitants. The statement has generally passed muster that
          the inhabitants of the peninsula are the purest type of Semites.
          The isolation of the country makes this a priori reasonable. The
          mental characteristics of the race are depth and strength of
          emotion, consequent warmth of feeling and brilliancy of
          expression, philosophical shallowness and metaphysical
          ineptitude, imagination of great power, a tremendous fixedness
          of will leading to fanatical intensity, and temperance in all
          but sexual relations. (6) Commerce. The products of Arabia have
          been remarkable for concentration rather than for bulk. Incense,
          spices, aromatic herbs, essences, gold, emeralds, agate, and
          onyx have been the staples of its trade. Before 1000 B.C., the
          Arabs were the common carriers of Eastern trade.

  III. History:

          The function of Arabia in world history has been to serve as the
          cradle, if not the birth-place, of the Semitic race. For this it
          was well fitted, isolated as it is by three seas and a trackless
          desert. At almost regular intervals it has sent forth hordes of
          Semites in waves of migration to become makers of history. The
          first of these made the initial conquest of the pre-Semitic
          civilization of the lower Tigris and Euphrates, and is
          represented by the great names of Sargon I. and his son
          Naram-Sin, about 3800 B.C. It was possibly the second wave which
          gave to Babylonia the Arabic dynasty which began to rule about
          2400 B.C., represented best by the renowed [525]Hammurabi
          (possibly the Amraphel of Gen. xiv.), the codifier of Babylonian
          law. The third wave was the Aramean migration, assigned to about
          the seventeenth pre-Christian century, of which the Hebrews were
          an offshoot. The Nabatæans (fifth to third centuries B.C.) were
          the fourth, and the Mohammedan exodus made the last of this
          remarkable series of migrations. It looks as though Arabia's
          function had been to nourish her sons for a millennium and then
          to send them forth to conquer an empire. The general conception
          that Arabia was wholly a country of nomads is not true. Recent
          exploration, partial though it is, has proved that not only are
          there regions of thickly settled populations and numerous
          well-built cities in the present, but that there were several
          kingdoms of considerable importance at least as early as 1000
          B.C. Three of the most noted are the Minæan, Sabean, and
          Hadramautic, situated in the south, but on the plateau; and
          those of Meluhha, Cush, and Mizri in the north, southeast from
          the Edomitic territory. The last two are referred to in the Old
          Testament, but are there confused with Ethiopia and Egypt, since
          the Hebrew name of the former is Cush and of the latter Mizraim.
          The investigations of Doughty, Halévy, and Glaser, to mention
          only these among a host of authorities, and the inscriptions now
          in the hands of scholars, render incontrovertible the existence
          of a Minæan realm as early as Solomon's time, and make it
          probable that this kingdom was subdued by a sovereign of the
          Sabean power (the Sheba of Scripture), which latter continued
          down to 500 B.C. or later. About the Christian era the
          Himyaritic or Ethiopian kingdom ruled in southern Arabia. While
          there are traces of Minæan and Sabean domination in northern
          Arabia, it is unlikely that the peninsula was unified
          governmentally before Mohammed's day. In spite of what has been
          said of the kingdoms of Arabia, the general idea that the Arab
          is a nomad is nearly correct. Tribal life is to him the normal
          one. Mohammed's miracle, therefore, was not, as he claimed, the
          Koran, but a united Arabia. Before him, Arabia was one great
          battleground of the tribes. The occupations of the people were
          commerce and pasturage; their pastimes were the feast, the
          chase, or the pursuit of vengeance in the blood-feud or of war
          for plunder or glory. A striking feature was the month of truce
          during which feud and war were suspended that the tribes might
          in peace revisit and worship at the shrines of their tribal
          deities. For the rest of the year, fighting was legal and
          normal.

  IV. Religion:

          When Mohammed chose Allah as his god, he took one whose name was
          already common property throughout the country. The three
          goddesses who were daughters of Allah (cf. Wellhausen, Reste
          arabischen Heidenthums, Berlin, 1897, 24 sqq.) and were widely
          worshiped, testify to this fact. But the Koran testifies to the
          dominance of idolatry; the Kaaba was a home of idols. W. R.
          Smith has demonstrated the existence of animism, with the
          consequent or accompanying totemism, as native and persistent
          among Arabs. Stone-worship, the cults of local gods, the bloody
          and the mystic sacrifice, especially the primitive sacrifice in
          which god and worshipers were clan-brothers and commensals, are
          proved facts for this region. All of which is to say that the
          gods of Arabia were many. Yet the civilization of cities implies
          the supereminence of some gods with a prestige which lifted them
          above the horde of little deities. These greater gods were
          heaven-gods, a consequence of the clear atmosphere and brilliant
          skies. Examples of these are Athtar, a male deity, the evening
          or morning star (north-Semitic, Ishtar, female), and Wadd, the
          moon-god, known also as Amm and regnant over love. Sun-deities
          of different names were numerous and were often feminine. But
          underlying the cult of these more prominent gods was that of the
          local divinities, the more cherished favorites of the tribes and
          clans. Sometimes the images or symbols of tribal gods were
          collected in some shrine which then became the goal of
          pilgrimage,--the case of the Kaaba at Mecca. The "Black Stone"
          in the Kaaba, the only official relic of ancient Arabia, is
          pronounced meteoric. It is a remainder of a once dominant
          fetishism.

          Owing to the difficulties offered by the physical character of
          the country and the rigid Mohammedanism of the people Arabia is
          not a promising field for Christian missionary enterprise. A few
          sporadic attempts have been made, however, in some of the coast
          towns, where foreign influence most readily finds entrance.
          There is a Roman Catholic vicar apostolic for Arabia with
          residence at Aden.

   Arabians
          ARABIANS (Lat. Arabici): A name given by Augustine (Hær.,
          lxxxiii.) to sectaries in Arabia, mentioned by Eusebius (Hist.
          eccl., vi 37), who says that they held that the human soul dies
          with the body and will rise with it on the Day of Resurrection.
          Origen combated this opinion at an Arabian synod about 246.

  1. The Name. Old Testament Usage.

          Aram is the Old Testament designation for the Semitic Arameans
          or Syrians settled in Syria and Mesopotamia, north to the Taurus
          and east to the Tigris; but, as these peoples never formed a
          political unit, the name is used only with reference to some
          particular tribe region, or state. Thus the Old Testament
          distinguishes. (1) Aram Naharaim, "Aram of the two rivers,"
          i.e., the Euphrates and Tigris (or Khabur; Gen. xxiv 10; Deut.
          xxiii. 4, Judges iii. 8; Ps. lx. title); in the [528]Amarna
          Tablets it is called Narima (ZA, vi., 1891, p. 258; in Egyptian
          inscriptions, Nahrina (W. Max Müller, Asien und Europa, Leipsic,
          1893, pp. 249 sqq.). The Pentateuch priest-code reads Padan
          (Paddan) Aram Gen. xxv 20; xxviii. 2, 5-7; xxxi 18; xxxiii. 18;
          xxxv 9, 26; xlvi. 15), "fields of Aram,"--a name which may be
          preserved in the Tell Feddan of Arabic geographers (see below,
          [529]§ 7). (2) Aram Dammesek, named from its chief city,
          Damascus, often called simply Aram because it was the people
          best known, and of most importance to Israel (II Sam. viii. 5-6;
          Isa. vii. 8; xvii. 3; Amos i. 5) (3) Aram Zobah, at the time of
          Saul and David the most powerful realm in Syria (I Sam xiv. 47;
          II Sam. viii. 3; x. 6, 8; Ps. lx title; I Chron. xviii. 3; II
          Chron. viii. 3). Schrader (KAT, 135) identifies Zobah with the
          Subit of the inscriptions, which he puts south of Damascus;
          Halévy identifies it with the later Chalcis on the slopes of
          Lebanon. (4) Aram Beth-Rehob (II Sam. x. 6), a city not far from
          Dan (Judges xviii. 28) in the upper part of the lowlands of Lake
          Huleh, watered by the Leddan, the middle source of the Jordan.
          (5) Aram Maachah (I Chron. xix. 6), and (6) Geshur in Aram (II
          Sam. xv. 8), independent kingdoms in the time of David. (See
          below, [530]§ 9.)

          In the list of nations in Gen. x., four descendants of Aram are
          mentioned: Uz, Hul, Gether, and Mash (verse 23). The first name
          is also found in Gen. xxii. 21 among the descendants of Nahor,
          and in xxxvi. 28 and I Chron. i. 42 among the Horites. In Jer.
          xxv. 20 "the kings of the land of Uz" are mentioned among those
          to whom Yahweh gives the wine-cup of his wrath; they are
          followed by the Philistines and the latter by Edom. Finally in
          Lam. iv. 21 the daughter of Edom is mentioned as dwelling in the
          land of Uz, i.e., having possession of the same. A comparison of
          these passages, including Job i. 1-3, shows that the Uzites as
          an Aramaic tribe must be looked for in the Hauran. Hul without
          doubt is the inhabitants of the Huleh low-country, mentioned
          above. Gether can not be identified. Mash, for which the
          Chronicler (i. 17) reads Meshech (cf. Ps. cxx. 5), has been
          connected since Bochart with Mt. Masius (cf. Strabo, xi., p.
          541), now Tur Abdin, north of Nisibis. When Aram is made a
          descendant of Kemuel (Gen. xxii. 21) and a grandson of Nahor, a
          younger branch of the Aramaic people is probably meant.

  2. Origin of the Arameans.

          As to the original home of the Arameans, the prophecy of Amos
          (ix. 7) states that they were brought from Kir and should go
          back thither in captivity (i. 5). The location of Kir is
          uncertain; some identify it with Cyrrhestica, between the
          Orontes and Euphrates; others think it means South Babylonia.
          The name has not as yet been found in inscriptions. Moses of
          Chorene (Hist. armen., i., p.12) mentions Aram among the
          ancestors of the Armenian people; but Aram has as little to do
          with Armenia as with Homer's Eremboi or Arimoi. The name may
          signify "elevation," "highland." In the cuneiform inscriptions
          it appears as Arumu and Arimi, the "land of the Khatti" also
          comprises the Arameans. Schrader thinks that the Khatti were the
          Western and Southern Arameans, the Arumu the Eastern and
          Northern. The Greeks called the Arameans Syrians, which is an
          abbreviation of Assyrians. Those Greeks who were settled along
          the southern coast of the Black Sea first applied the name to
          their Cappadocian neighbors, who were Assyrian subjects. Thence
          it was extended to the whole population of the Assyrian Empire,
          and thus it became synonymous with Aramea. Afterward the
          Christian Arameans adopted the name Syrian, because among the
          Jews Aramean meant heathen.

  3. Religion.

          The religion of the Arameans was polytheistic (Judges x 6; II
          Chron. xxviii. 23) and like all cults of Nearer Asia was
          symbolic nature-worship. Owing to the dispersion of the
          Arameans, an Aramean pantheon is not known, but only individual
          gods. Furthermore, at a very early period, Babylonian, Arabian,
          and probably other deities were adopted by the Arameans; the
          Syrian god Tammuz (Ezek. viii. 14) is of Assyrian origin.

  4. The Aramaic Language.

          The Aramaic language belongs to the northern division of the
          Semitic family; it includes an Eastern and a Western branch. To
          the latter belongs the so-called Biblical Aramaic (Jer. x. 2;
          Dan. ii. 4-vii. 28; Ezra iv.-8, vi.18; vii. 12-26; cf. Gen.
          xxxi. 47), which since the time of Jerome (ad Dan., ii. 4) has
          been erroneously called "Chaldaic." According to II Kings xviii.
          26, Aramaic was understood in Jerusalem in the time of the
          kings, though not by the common people. At an early time it was
          the lingua franca of Nearer Asia, and occupied a position
          similar to that of the English or French languages of today.
          About the middle of the second century B.C., the Aramaic had
          become the vernacular in Syria, Palestine, and the neighboring
          countries. To the Western Aramaic belongs also a great part of
          Jewish literature (Targums, Palestinian Gemara, etc.), the
          Samaritan, the idiom of the so-called Nabatæan inscriptions of
          the Sinaitic peninsula, the Palmyrene inscriptions, etc. The
          most important branch of the Eastern Aramaic is the so-called
          Syriac, usually designated as the "Edessene language"; its
          literature is almost exclusively Christian, and spread even into
          Persia. The division of these Syriac-speaking Christians into
          Nestorians and Monophysites resulted in the cultivation of an
          East Syriac (Nestorian, Persian) and West Syriac (Jacobitic,
          Roman) dialect. The oldest Syriac document still extant is the
          translation of the Old and New Testaments which probably belongs
          to the end of the second Christian century. (See [531]Bible
          Versions, A, III.) To the Eastern Aramaic belongs also the
          language of the Babylonian Talmud, a Jewish transformation of
          the Syriac; the Mandæan (called also Sabian), the dialects in
          which the holy writings of the [532]Mandæans are written; and
          certain dialects, still spoken about Tur Abdin on the upper
          Tigris, in certain parts east and north of Mosul, in the
          neighboring mountains of Kurdistan, and on the Western side of
          Lake Urumiah. The Western Aramaic dialects are more closely
          allied to the Hebrew than the Eastern Aramaic, and not only
          strongly influenced the Hebrew, but finally displaced it. Just
          when this took place can not be determined, but at the time of
          Jesus the vernacular in Palestine was exclusively Aramaic. Also
          see [533]Mesopotamia.

  5. Extent of Aramean Settlements.

          The Arameans were the most widely distributed of the Semitic
          families in their permanent settlements in pre-Christian times.
          Till the end of the seventh century B.C. they were found as
          seminomads with enormous herds of cattle on both sides of the
          lower Tigris east of Babylonia. As shepherds and as traders they
          moved west and north from time immemorial along the course of
          the Euphrates as far as the mountains, also crossing the river
          into Syria in occasional bands. After the downfall of the
          Egyptian and Hittite régimes in Syria they occupied that region
          in large numbers in the twelfth century B.C., and soon became
          there the controlling power, a position which, as far as race
          and language were concerned, they maintained till many centuries
          after the Christian era. They thus extended from the western
          border of Elam, as far as the Mediterranean; anywhere in this
          immense area the Arameans were at home. They had the instinct
          and the habit of travel and trade.

  6. Activity and Enterprise of the Arameans.

          Even as shepherds they were not like the Bedouin Arabs, for they
          kept their flocks and herds mainly for sale in the markets of
          the cities, near which they were usually found. As traders they
          were for land traffic what the Phenicians were on the sea. The
          range of their activity and enterprise is indicated by the fact
          that in the eighth century B.C. Aramaic inscriptions were
          written in Assyria east of the middle Tigris, and in the extreme
          northwest of Syria; that Aramaic was then understood in
          Palestine (II Kings xviii. 26); and that soon thereafter the
          Semitic alphabet, with Aramaic endings to the names of the
          letters, was introduced into Greece from Asia Minor. The
          Arameans were, in fact, the successors of the old Babylonians in
          the control of the business and commerce of western Asia, and it
          was from their system of writing (not from the Phenician) that
          the later alphabets of most of the civilized world were derived.

  7. The Arameans of Mesopotamia.

          For Biblical history the most important Aramean settlements were
          those about the middle Euphrates in upper Mesopotamia, and those
          in southern Syria and northern Palestine which are usually
          represented in modern versions by the name "Syrian." The former
          region was Aramean from very early times, even when under
          Babylonian control in the fourth and third millenniums B.C. The
          center of the community was Charran (Haran), on the river
          Balich, one of the greatest trading cities of the ancient East.
          It was a seat of the worship of the moon-god, corresponding to
          Ur on the lower Euphrates. Hence the clan of Terah, to which
          Abraham belonged, when on its western migration from Ur halted
          at Charran and settled in its neighborhood, between that city
          and the Euphrates. This district is the Paddan-Aram of P, which
          is shown by Gen. xxxi. 21 to have been east of the Euphrates.
          Aram Naharaim, used by other writers for the same region, does
          not mean "Aram of the two rivers" (Euphrates and Tigris), but
          merely "Aram of the rivers," and therefore does not include
          Mesopotamia in the wider sense as the Septuagint translates it.
          Probably the right reading is Naharim ("rivers"), in accordance
          with the Amarna form Na'rima.

  8. Their Place in Biblical History.

          This region was the ancestral home of Israel, as is indicated in
          the traditions of Rebecca and Laban, of Leah and Rachel as well
          as in the saying "a wandering Aramean was thy father" (Deut.
          xxvi. 5, R. V., margin). After the establishment of Israel in
          Palestine and of the southern Arameans in the intervening Syrian
          territory, little is heard from the sacred writers of the
          Mesopotamian Arameans. According to Judges iii. 8, 10 a king,
          Cushan-rishathaim, overran the whole western country including
          the land of Israel, which he held for eight years. Another brief
          notice is to the effect that Hadarezer king of the Arameans of
          Zobah, had the assistance of troops from beyond the river
          against King David (II Sam. x. 16).

  9. Cities and States in Southern Syria.

          Much more important for Israel was the group of communities on
          the northeast of Palestine, of which the most famous was
          Damascus, the greatest city and state ever controlled by the
          Arameans. Damascus, however, as a city, was much older than the
          Aramean immigration of the twelfth and eleventh centuries B.C.,
          and was doubtless an Amorite trading-post in the old days of
          Babylonian supremacy. Indeed, it is doubtless true that the
          Arameans occupied Amorite settlements, just as the contemporary
          Israelites occupied those of the Canaanites. These "Syrian"
          states, southwest of Damascus, and on the lower slopes of
          Hermon, are first heard of in connection with the wars of David
          about 980 B.C. (II Sam. viii. and x.), the passage referring to
          the wars of Saul (I Sam. xiv. 47) being based on a confused
          reminiscence of later conditions. To Zobah (at first the most
          powerful state), Geshur, and Beth-Rehob on the east of the upper
          Jordan must be added Tob (Judges xi. 3, 5; II Sam. x. 6, 8); and
          to Maachah on the west must be added Hamath, to be distinguished
          from "Hamath the Great" (Amos vi. 2), the more famous city on
          the Orontes in Middle Syria. This Hamath lay northwest of the
          city of Dan, and beside it ran the road leading west and north
          to the valley of the Litany and Orontes (Coelesyria). Hence the
          "entering in of Hamath" marked the northern boundary of Israel,
          as did also the neighboring city of Dan. All of these cities and
          petty states were long debatable ground between Damascus and
          northern Israel. They lay, however, within the natural domain of
          Damascus, and ultimately became Syrian.

  10. The Arameans of Damascus and Israel.

          Israel's relations with the kingdom of Damascus did much to
          determine its destiny. After Damascus and the sister states had
          been made tributary to David, a new régime in Damascus put that
          city at the head of the Syrian Arameans in the days of Solomon
          (c. 945 B.C.), and threw off the yoke of Israel (I Kings xi. 23
          sqq.). The next step was the annexation of northern Naphtali
          (already, as above stated, in large part Aramean), in the reign
          of Baasha, by Benhadad I. (about 890 B.C.). This was the
          beginning of a war which lasted a century, and which would
          certainly have resulted in the ruin of Israel, if it had not
          been for the repeated attacks made upon Damascus for the great
          Assyrian power. Israel suffered most from Benhadad II., and
          Hazael of Damascus. Only once is a truce mentioned between the
          two countries (I Kings xx. 34; xxii. 1), which lasted over two
          years (855-853 B.C.) and was favored by an exceptional
          Combination of the western states against an Assyrian invasion
          under Shalmaneser II., so that in 854 B.C. Benhadad and Ahab
          were found fighting side by side in defense of the West-land.
          The war, when resumed, was for a time disastrous to the Hebrews,
          so that in the reigns of Jehu and Jehoahaz, Hazael of Damascus
          and his successor held not only northern but probably also
          southern Israel in subjection. At length in the reign of Joash
          of Israel in 797 B.C. Damascus was taken by Adad-nirari III., of
          Assyria, and Aramean domination came to an end. Damascus,
          however, retained its independence, which it held till it was
          converted into a Roman province after the capture of the city by
          Tiglath-Pileser III. in 732 B.C.

  11. Spread of Aramean Influence in Later Times.

          Damascus, however, still retained its commercial importance and
          remained the business and social center of Aramean influence in
          southern Syria, which increased with the extinction of the small
          western nationalities. Indeed, the unifying process through
          which the whole of western Asia passed under the domination of
          Assyria, the later Babylonian, and the Persian empires, was
          materially hastened by the trade and commerce of the ubiquitous
          Arameans. Palestine itself gradually became Aramean in speech,
          if not materially so in population. The prevalence of the
          Aramaic language for many centuries after the Arameans had
          ceased to have any great political importance is the most
          striking proof of the manifold activity of the people.
          Originally one of the three great north Semitic dialects, along
          with the Babylonian (Assyrians and Canaanitic (Hebrew), it had
          practically, displaced the other two as a living speech by the
          second century B.C. Thus it happens that not only were
          considerable portions of two Old Testament books written in
          Aramaic but also all of these books had to be popularly
          explained in Aramaic and translated into that language in the
          form of the Targums, before and after the Christian era.
          Moreover, the language of the later Old Testament books
          generally is more or less colored by Aramaic, and Jesus and his
          disciples spoke an Aramaic dialect (Matt. xxvii. 46, and
          elsewhere). But the chief literary use of Aramaic, came after
          the close of the canon, Edessa (modern Orfa) in upper
          Mesopotamia having succeeded to much of the business and
          importance of the neighboring Charran which remained pagan. A
          great Christian school was founded there in the second century,
          and this became the center of the vast "Syriac" literature.

   Arator
          ARATOR, ?-rê´-t?r: Christian poet of the middle of the sixth
          century. He was a Ligurian of noble family, and was educated by
          the archbishop Laurentius at Milan; the poet Ennodius was his
          friend, and the latter's nephew Parthenius was Arator's fellow
          student at Ravenna. He chose a diplomatic career and for a time
          acted as comes domesticorum, and afterward as comes privatorum
          of the Ostrogothic king Athalaric. He then entered the
          priesthood and was made subdeacon at Rome by Pope Vigilius, to
          whom lie dedicated his epico-didactic poem, De actibus
          apostolorum libri ii (read in public in 544). In 1076 and 1250
          hexameters he describes the deeds of the apostles to the
          martyrdom of Peter and Paul, taking the Acts of Luke as a basis.
          He treats his subject with some poetical skill and with rich
          allegorical expositions, which are often in bad taste. He aims
          to show the superiority of Peter to Paul, and the work contains
          traces of Mariolatry, hagiolatry, and relic-worship. An epistle
          of Arator's to Vigilius, a second to an abbot Florianus, and a
          third to his early friend Parthenius are also extant. His main
          work was much read in the Middle Ages, and exists in many
          manuscripts of the tenth and eleventh centuries. It and the
          letters are in MPL, lxviii. 46-252, and there is an edition by
          A. Hübner, Neisse, 1850.

          ARCADIUS, ??r-kê´-di-Us, FLAVIUS: Eastern Roman emperor 383-408;
          b. in Spain, about 377; d. at Constantinople May 1, 408. He was
          the elder son of the emperor Theodosius and the empress Ælia
          Flavilla, and was educated in secular sciences at Constantinople
          by the sophist Themistius, and by Arsenius, an ascetic, in the
          Christian religion. In 383 his father conferred upon him the
          title of Augustus, and in 384 he was made consul. When in 394
          Theodosius went to the West to overthrow the usurper Eugenius,
          the government was left in care of Arcadius, with the assistance
          of the minister Rufinus. By the unexpected death of the emperor,
          Jan. 17, 395, at Milan, Arcadius became emperor of the East. By
          nature good-hearted and yielding, also without energy and
          narrow-minded, he became the weak tool of those who knew how to
          obtain his favor, above all of Rufinus, a cunning and
          unprincipled Gaul, and, after his murder, of the eunuch
          Eutropius, who covered his selfish atrocities with the name of
          the lawful ruler, and finally till his fall (399) united all
          power in himself. Arcadius was also influenced by his wife
          Eudocia, the beautiful daughter of Bauto, a Frank. Under him the
          Byzantine empire assumed that oriental character, which it
          subsequently retained. His piety was sincere, and he worshiped
          the relics of saints and martyrs devoutly. Even before he was
          sole regent he interdicted the public worship, instruction, and
          organization of the heretics (Cod. Theod., XVI. v. 24; a. 394),
          and in the following year withdrew all former privileges (XVI.
          v. 25). Investigations had to be made for heretics in the
          imperial chancery, and among the court-officials (XVI. v. 29).
          Closely connected with this was his procedure against
          polytheism. In 397 he ordered that the material from temples in
          Syria should be used for the repair or construction of public
          roads, bridges, aqueducts, and walls (XV. i. 36), and in 399 he
          issued an order to the prefect of the East to destroy all rural
          sanctuaries. In all this Chrysostom was his hearty supporter.
          The most important result was probably the destruction of the
          Marneion and of seven other temples in Gaza in 401 (cf. the
          interesting account in Marcus's life of Porphyrius, bishop of
          Gaza, and J. Dräseke, Gesammelte patristische Untersuchungen,
          Leipsic, 1889, pp. 208 sqq.). Yet it can not be said that
          Hellenism suffered much under Arcadius; compared with the policy
          of Theodosius, there was even a certain relaxation (cf. V.
          Schultze, Geschichte des Unterganges des griechisch-römischen
          Heidentums, i., Jena, 1887, 353 sqq., ii., 1892, passim). Toward
          the Jews Arcadius was surprisingly friendly, and it has been
          suspected that they secured the favor of Eutropius by money.
          They had a jurisdiction of their own similar to that of the
          bishops, and the right of sanctuary analogous to the
          ecclesiastical (Cod. Theod., II. i. 10; IX. xlv 2; cf. Grætz,
          Geschichte der Juden, iv. 387 sqq.). Seditions from within, and
          inroads of the barbarians from without, made the rule of the
          weak emperor a sad chapter of Byzantine history, which, however,
          must not be judged wholly according to the unfriendly or hostile
          heathen sources (especially Eunapius and Zosimus). Quite a
          number of reforms were decreed during his government which is
          also not lacking in other good measures.

   Arcani Disciplina
          ARCANI DISCIPLINA ("Instruction in the [Sacred] Secret," i.e.,
          initiation into the mystery): A term first applied by Dallæus
          and G. T. Meier to the practise of maintaining a studied
          reticence (fides silentii) concerning the form and character of
          introduction into the Church, as if this were something
          analogous to initiation into the mysteries of the heathen world.
          The practise is especially observed in the fourth and fifth
          centuries. Baptism and the Lord's Supper, with the baptismal
          formula and the Lord's Prayer, in so far as these had an
          essential part in the introduction, were made the center of the
          supposed mysteries. In accordance with this idea, after the
          sermon, to which all could listen, at the beginning of the so
          called missa fidelium, the deacon warned all uninitiated away
          from divine service with the words: "Let no one of the
          catechumens, let no one of the hearers, let no one of the
          unbelievers, let no one of the heterodox, be present" (Apostolic
          Constitutions, viii. 12).

  Various Theories.

          The arcani disciplina became a subject of confessional polemics
          through the attempt of the Jesuit Emanuel von Schelstrate to
          prove that it was instituted by Jesus and followed by the
          apostles; and that for this reason the Roman doctrine of the
          sacraments (especially transubstantiation), the veneration of
          images and saints, and other teachings of the Roman Catholic
          Church do not appear in the early Church. In reply Tentzel
          proved conclusively that until toward the year 200 the Church
          knew of no mysteries to be kept secret. Nevertheless, Roman
          Catholic scholars with few exceptions (e.g., Batiffol) have
          endeavored to defend Schelstrate's position. Justin's detailed
          exposition of the act of baptism and the celebration of the
          eucharist, however (Apol., i. 61, 66, 67), is decisive. The
          exclusion of the unbaptized was an inner necessity (cf. Didache,
          ix. 5) and does not imply a mysterious character of the cult;
          the secrecy also concerned not the dogma directly, but the
          symbols and performance.

          Thus far Protestants are agreed, but not concerning the nature
          and origin of the disciplina. Casaubon assigned its beginnings
          to the influence of the heathen mysteries and a borrowing of
          their forms for purposes of instruction, and scholars
          immediately following him accepted his views. Frommann sought
          the root in an imitation of the Jewish practise with regard to
          proselytes. Rothe called attention to a connection with the
          catechumenate of the early Church, and Credner to a relation
          with the twofold division of the cult resulting from the
          dogmatic-mystic conception of the Lord's Supper. T. Harnack
          recognized in the discipline a systematic transformation of the
          divine service into a form of mystery,?a phenomenon which has a
          parallel in the fact that the Roman Catholic Church today finds
          the secret of its power in the mystic-theurgic act of its
          priests (cf. Bonwetsch). Zezschwitz maintained, more in accord
          with the views of Rothe that the cult acquired an exclusive
          character and the fides silentii arose in the Church from
          prudential motives because of persecution; when persecution
          ceased, the sermon sufficed for the needs of the catechumens
          (audientes) and full knowledge of the higher Christian secrets,
          as well as participation in the vital part of the service, was
          reserved for a final grade of maturity (attained only by the
          competentes); references to these matters naturally ceased. It
          may confidently be asserted, however, that the arcani disciplina
          was not founded in the external condition of the Church or in
          pedagogic considerations, but was a real, though unconscious,
          assimilation to the ruling ideas of the mysteries. The notion
          that communion with God was possible only by assimilation to God
          in a future state of incorruption through the medium of sacred
          acts, led as naturally to the formation of a hierarchy,
          differing from the laity and bringing divine essence into it by
          sacred acts, as to a transformation of the divine service into a
          celebration of mysteries which were supposed to include the
          divine in symbols and symbolic acts. Anrich is correct,
          therefore, in designating the disciplina as an analogy within
          the Church of the system of efficacious initiations among the
          Gnöstics and the natural outcome of the theology of a Clement
          and an Origen, influenced by the Greek mysteries (against this
          view, however, cf. Batiffol).

  Not Earlier than the Third Century.

          Zahn (p. 326) has demonstrated that the beginnings of the arcani
          disciplina can not be traced earlier than the third century.
          When Irenæus (Hær., III. iv. 1-2) demands that the baptismal
          confession be transmitted orally it is only to the end that,
          being written in the memory, it may become an inner possession.
          Tertullian (Apol., vii.; Ad nat., i. 7) speaks of a fides
          silentii with reference to the Christian mysteries, but from the
          standpoint of an opponent. Hippolytus (Ad Dan., i. 16, 18)
          speaks of baptism without pointing out the duty of silence.
          Phrases like "the initiated know" in Origen do not establish the
          existence of the disciplina, since it can not be proven that
          Origen represented general usage. In Contra Celsum, iii. 59-61,
          he has no cultic acts in view; when he remarks (Levit. hom., 9,
          10; ix. 364, ed. Lommatsch), "He who is imbued with the
          mysteries knows the flesh and the blood of the Word of God," he
          is thinking of the mysteries of the gnosis (Anrich, 129, n. 2).
          His reference to the anxiety lest some of the consecrated bread
          should be dropped (Exod. hom., xiii. 3; ix. 156) is a warning
          against the inattentive hearing of the Word; and his reference
          (Lev. hom., xiii. 3; ix. 403) to ecclesiastica mysteria proves
          nothing. Methodius does not apply Matt. vii. 6 to sacred acts
          (Photius, Bibl., cod. 235), nor are such acts" the orgies of our
          mysteries, the mystic rites of those who are initiated"
          (Sympos., vi. 6).

          In the fourth and fifth centuries the arcani disciplina was in
          its bloom; the frequent occurrence in the sermon of "the
          initiated know," "the initiated," is characteristic, and the
          transference of the phraseology of the mysteries into the Church
          is evident. "To initiate" (Gk. myeisthai) and "to instruct"
          (katecheisthai) become interchangeable terms. Baptism is called
          "the seal of the mystic perfection" and "a mystic purification
          (katharmos) and lustration (katharsion)"; the Lord's Supper is
          "the mystery"; its elements are "symbols." "To be initiated"
          (mystagOgeisthai) signifies to be competent to partake of the
          sacraments, and to betray the mysteries is expressed by the
          corresponding exorcheisthai.

  The Immediate Object of the Disciplina.

          It is characteristic of the disciplina that the immediate object
          of the mystery was not the dogma and sacramental gift, but the
          elements and the ritual performance. In Theodoret's dialogue
          Inconfusus (iv. 125, ed. Schultze), the orthodox shrinks from
          openly naming bread and cup lest "some one uninitiated be
          present," and vaguely calls the body and blood of the Lord a
          gift. The desire was, of course, to withhold even from the eyes
          of the initiated the act and the "mystic symbols"; hence the
          exclusion of the unbaptized from the missa fidelium and the
          watch at the door by the ostiaries. Baptism and the Lord's
          Supper were the real object of the disciplina. To keep people in
          actual ignorance was, of course, impossible, but the silence
          observed produced the impression of a mystery. The Lord's Prayer
          at the Supper held the same position as the confession in
          baptism; the character of secret objects was given to both (cf.
          Sozomen, Hist. eccl., i. 20; Ambrose, De Cain et Abel, I. ix.
          37). The opposite to the confession of the neophyte was the
          renunciation, which was also kept secret. Everything which
          preceded and followed baptism necessarily partook of the
          secrecy. The eucharist as the climax of the whole mystagogy is
          the mystery par excellence. Dogmas were mysteries (Basil, De
          spir. sanc., xxvii. 66) only in so far as the Church generally
          claimed to possess wonderful mysteries, especially the dogma of
          the Trinity on account of its relation to the baptismal symbol;
          but no secrecy of the dogma was intended. With the disappearance
          of the catechumenate the arcani disciplina ceased, although in
          the Greek liturgy the formula for dismissing the catechumens
          remained; but the cult of the Greek Church now actually assumed
          the character of a mystico-allegorical drama, a mystery of the
          heathen kind, though of a higher type.

   Archbishop
          ARCHBISHOP: A bishop in the Roman Catholic and some parts of the
          Anglican Church, who has not only the charge of his own diocese
          like any other bishop, but also certain rights of oversight and
          precedence over several other bishops whose dioceses are
          included in his province. In the third century, by analogy with
          the political divisions of the Empire (see [534]Eparchy), there
          grew up an organization of several bishoprics under the
          leadership of a metropolitan, the bishop of the provincial
          capital; it was his place to conduct episcopal elections, to
          confirm the choice and to consecrate the one chosen, and to
          convoke the bishops of his province in an annual synod. In
          concert with them, he regulated the affairs of the province, and
          the synod formed a court of appeal from the decisions of
          individual bishops, as well as one of first instance for charges
          brought against them. In the following centuries the
          metropolitan system was adopted by the Christian countries of
          the West as well. In the Merovingian period, however, the joint
          power claimed by the princes in filling episcopal sees and the
          importance attained by national councils robbed the position of
          the metropolitans of much of its independence; nor were they
          able to recover it in the Carolingian era, between the
          domination assumed by Charlemagne and the papal claims to an
          immediate decision in weighty matters, for which the
          pseudo-Isidorian decretals had furnished a basis. The rights of
          a metropolitan were accordingly limited in the thirteenth
          century legal compilations of the Corpus Juria Canonici to the
          following particulars: (1) The confirmation of episcopal
          elections and consecration of bishops in his province; (2)
          calling and presiding over provincial councils; (3) general
          oversight of his suffragans, visitation of their dioceses, and
          imposition of censures and penalties on them, though not of
          deposition; (4) hearing, of appeals from episcopal courts; and
          (5) the so-called [535]Jus devolutionis. The first of these he
          lost in the fifteenth century, when confirmation and
          consecration of bishops were reserved to the pope. The Council
          of Trent confirmed the second, but limited the third by
          requiring the assent of the provincial council. At the same
          time, however, he was charged with the erection, maintenance,
          and direction of seminaries in the dioceses of his suffragans,
          and with the enforcement of their obligation of residence. An
          archbishop has the title of "Most Reverend," and ranks
          immediately after patriarchs. He wears the [536]pallium as a
          special symbol of his jurisdiction, and a particular kind of
          cross (crux erecta or gestatoria) is carried before him within
          his own province. The title archiepiskopos is frequently applied
          in the fourth century to the metropolitan of Alexandria, but
          after the development of the great patriarchates it came to
          denote other bishops of large cities who were undistinguishable
          in rank from metropolitans; and the titles have been practically
          synonymous in the West--though there are a few Roman Catholic
          archbishops (such as those of Amalfi, Lucca, and Udine) who are
          not metropolitans, and in the case of titular archbishops (see
          [537]Bishop, Titular) it follows from the nature of their office
          that there is no metropolitan jurisdiction. In the Anglican
          communion, the title of archbishop was for a long time confined
          to the metropolitans of England and Ireland, owing to legal
          difficulties in the way of its use in the colonial church; but
          of late years there has been an increasing tendency to its use,
          and the proposal has even been made to establish archbishops
          with metropolitan jurisdiction in the Episcopal Church of the
          United States. In the evangelical churches of Germany the
          dignity of an archbishop has been conferred only in individual
          instances on general superintendents, as by Frederick William
          III. on Borowski at Königsberg in 1829 (see [538]Borowski,
          Ludwig Ernest von).

          Templebready (1863-72), and rector of St. Luke's, Cork
          (1872-94). He was archdeacon of Cork from 1878 to 1894, canon of
          St. Patrick's Cathedral, Cork, in 1891, and examining chaplain
          to bishops Meade and Gregg of Cork from 1872 to 1894. He was
          dean of Cork from the latter year until 1897, when he was
          consecrated bishop of Killaloe.

   Archdeacon and Archpriest
          ARCHDEACON and ARCHPRIEST: Officials who are mentioned very
          early as heads of the lower or ministering clergy and of the
          other priests. Both are assistants and sometimes representatives
          of the bishop, the archpriest more in liturgical functions, the
          archdeacon in those of church government. In the early history
          of the dioceses of northern and western Europe, which were
          originally much larger than the older ones of the East and
          South, we find a number of archpriests whose functions are
          different from those indicated. The diocese is divided into
          parishes (much larger than the modern parishes), frequently
          following political divisions in their boundaries. The
          inhabitants of a parish, considered as a single community, have
          one church, often on the site of a heathen temple, set apart for
          the principal ecclesiastical functions. This is the church for
          Sunday service, baptism, funerals, and the payment of church
          taxes. Through the surrounding country are scattered other
          smaller churches used for less important functions, and served
          by clergy who are representatives of the parish priest. With the
          increase in the number of principal or "baptismal" churches, the
          importance of the archpriests diminished. From the ninth century
          their place was taken by rural deans, who had the oversight of
          more than one archpresbyterate; and, as they were generally
          taken from among the archpriests, frequently retained that
          title. The archdeacons did not hold everywhere the same relation
          to the archpriests. Under Leo the Great (440-461) they appear in
          charge of church property and jurisdiction in the dioceses. By
          the ninth century, priests began to be named to this office, and
          finally none but priests held it, who were placed over the
          archpriests. About the same time in France, somewhat later in
          Germany, the custom arose of dividing the dioceses into several
          of these archdeaconries. With the development of the cathedral
          chapters, it became usual for the head of the chapter to be
          archdeacon, or, if there were several archdeacons in the
          diocese, the office was held also by canons or other heads of
          collegiate bodies. The power of the archdeacon gradually
          increased; by the beginning of the thirteenth century he is
          already known as judex ordinarius, and has an independent right
          to make canonical visitations, to decide many cases (especially
          matrimonial), to examine candidates for ordination, and to
          install beneficed clergy. The bishops found it necessary to
          repress the presumption of the archdeacons, and in some cases
          (as at Tours 1239, Liége 1287, Mainz 1310) they obtained
          legislation in councils against further growth of these powers;
          in other cases they set up officials of their own to exercise
          the Jurisdiction which the archdeacons either had or claimed.
          Among these latter are the officiales foranei, with a concurrent
          jurisdiction, and above both, for the exercise of appellate
          jurisdiction and of the rights reserved to the bishops, the
          officiales principales and vicars-general. Since neither the
          archdeacons nor the archpriests gave ready submission to these
          new officials, a great number of local differences of usage grew
          up, which were first reduced to some sort of uniformity by the
          Council of Trent in the sixteenth century. By it the archdeacons
          were finally deprived of all criminal, and matrimonial
          jurisdiction, and their right to hold visitations made dependent
          on the bishop's permission. Since that time they have declined
          in importance or disappeared entirely in many dioceses, and
          their functions are nowadays discharged usually by the
          vicar-general and his assistants. At Rome the archdeacon
          developed into the cardinal-camerlingo and the
          cathedral-archpriest into the cardinal-vicar, while in the other
          dioceses their place has been frequently taken by coadjutor or
          assistant bishops.

          (E. Friedberg.)

          In the Church of England the archidiaconal office has been
          retained in vigor. There are seventy-one archdeacons in all,
          each diocese having a plurality. They are members of the
          cathedral chapters and often hold separate benefices. Appointed
          by the bishop, the archdeacon assists the bishop in visitation
          and in looking after the temporalities of the parishes entreated
          to his care. He has the privilege and duty of holding court from
          time to time and from place to place for the trial of minor
          ecclesiastical causes both disciplinary and financial.

   Archeology, Biblical
          ARCHEOLOGY, BIBLICAL:

  Meaning and Scope.

          The term archeology has become current through the work of
          Josephus bearing that name (Gk. Archaiologia; Lat.
          Antiquitates),--a presentation of Hebrew and Jewish history from
          the Creation to the time of Nero. Before Josephus, Dionysius of
          Halicarnassus (i. 4; iv. 1) and others applied the name to
          ancient histories and mythologies. Biblical archeology in this
          sense should treat Biblical history in all its relations. The
          term is now restricted, however, to a certain section of
          Biblical history, and means the scientific description of the
          relations, institutions, and customs of the civil and religious
          life of Israel in Bible times. The science is thus distinguished
          from Biblical history in the common sense, from Biblical
          theology, and from Christian archeology and church history. It
          would be more exact to speak of Hebrew-Jewish archeology based
          on Biblical sources; but the old name is too firmly established
          to be superseded.

  Aim, Method, and Subdivisions.

          The science is one of the most important helps to the
          understanding of the Old Testament and such parts of the New as
          have a Jewish background; it acquaints both the scholar and the
          Bible-reader with the conditions which must be known if the
          events recorded and the religious views set forth are to be
          rightly appreciated. But its aim can only be attained when
          sought in the right way. The method must be historical and the
          study must begin with a critical examination of the sources; the
          customs and institutions described can not be considered
          isolated phenomena, but must be treated as parts of the organic
          whole of world history; their historical development must be
          traced. It may here be remarked that in the present state of
          knowledge of the history of Hebrew literature many points of
          archeology do not admit of a final decision. A topical
          arrangement on the whole seems preferable to an attempt to
          present the matter chronologically. The most natural subdivision
          draws the line between religious and secular things. The former
          division will include the holy places (the ark of the covenant,
          the tabernacle, high places, the temple, synagogues), holy
          actions (sacrifice, prayer, vows, oracles, purification), holy
          seasons (Sabbath, new moon, festivals), and holy persons
          (priests, Levites, seers, prophets, Nazirites, hierodules,
          etc.). The latter head subdivides into things of public and
          private life, and includes arts and sciences, weights, measures,
          divisions of time, and the like. A description of land and
          people forms a fitting introduction.

  Sources.

          Of the sources of Biblical archeology, the most important are,
          of course, monuments, inscriptions, and coins. As to monuments,
          Palestine is well known to be poorer than most other lands of
          civilized antiquity. The most important now known are certain
          remains of buildings, walls, and aqueducts in Jerusalem. Here
          and there graves have been opened which throw some light upon
          burial customs. Pottery and weights may be mentioned here,
          though specimens are few. The triumphal arch of Titus in Rome
          has sculptures of articles of temple furniture, and various
          Assyrian, Egyptian, and Phenician monuments and sculptures
          illustrate Israelitic architecture (temples, palaces, altars,
          etc.), explain Israelitic customs (dress, war, etc.), or furnish
          pictures of Israelitic things or persons. Inscriptions relating
          to Hebrew and Jewish history are also surprisingly few. The only
          important ones thus far found are the [540]Moabite Stone, the
          [541]Siloam inscription, and the tablet on the temple of Herod.
          Certain Phenician inscriptions (such as the sarcophagus
          inscription of Eshmunezer and the votive tablet of Massilia),
          and some Greek and Latin inscriptions from Palestine touch upon
          Jewish history. The Assyrian and Egyptian inscriptions and those
          of Nearer Asia in general, as well as all monuments of these
          peoples, now and then furnish material of more or less
          importance (see [542]Inscriptions). Such coins as we have belong
          to Maccabean and later times. The written sources are: (1) The
          books of the Old and New Testaments and the Old Testament
          apocrypha; (2) the writings of Josephus, especially the Bellum
          Judaicum, the Antiquitates, and the Contra Apionem, which are
          not altogether free from partizanship; (3) Philo's great
          allegorical commentary on the Pentateuch, which likewise has an
          apologetic tendency and betrays the fact that the author did not
          know Hebrew; (4) the rabbinic writings, Midrash, Targums, and
          Talmud, which are obscure and in their present form are hardly
          older than the second Christian century. Lastly, owing to the
          tenacity with which nomad Bedouins hold to their customs and
          religious conceptions for centuries, the accounts of travelers
          in Palestine and neighboring lands from the Middle Ages to the
          present time, as well as the descriptions of pre-Islamic Arabia,
          furnish an important source and one which has only lately begun
          to receive the attention which it deserves.

          (R. Kittel.)

  Certain Distinctions.

          The definition given above may be better appreciated if certain
          distinctions are pointed out and explained: (1) The distinction
          between Biblical history and Biblical archeology. The archeology
          of a country or a people is an essential preparation for the
          intelligent study of its history. But archeology also includes a
          related branch of historical study, namely the history and
          antiquities of the related peoples, and neither the beginnings
          nor progress of Hebrew history can be understood without a good
          knowledge of the older and of the contemporary Semites out of
          whom Israel grew, by whom its fortunes were determined, and
          whose genius influenced vitally its religious and social
          character. For example, in the first order of value for Biblical
          study must be placed the history and religion of Babylonia and
          Assyria, and the religious and social institutions of the
          ancient Arabians and Arameans. (2) The distinction between the
          relevant and the irrelevant in the history and antiquities of
          the related or neighboring peoples. Here the vaguest notions are
          encouraged by a loose application of the term archeology. For
          example, Egypt is constantly looked to for illustration of the
          Bible and for confirmation of its records, and a large part of
          the material published by the Society of Biblical Archeology,
          and the greater portion of many separate works upon the same
          theme are devoted to Egyptian research, which has yielded very
          little for the understanding of Biblical history, and virtually
          nothing for the illustration of the religious and social life of
          the Hebrews. The reason therefor lies partly in the unique and
          unsympathetic character of Egyptian culture, partly in the fact
          that Egypt had very seldom any controlling influence on
          Palestine during the formative period of Israel, and partly in
          the circumstance that the Egyptian records are not so
          businesslike and accurate as, for example, those of Assyria and
          Babylonia, which form an indispensable supplement to Biblical
          history. (3) The distinction between ancient and modern
          conditions. It is a common error to suppose that the study of
          Bible lands and the manners and customs of their present
          habitants furnish Biblical archeology accurately reproduced. As
          a matter of fact such a study is informing only along the line
          of external resemblance. The outward life of the Semitic peoples
          has remained in many respects like its ancient past because of a
          similarity of occupation and the slow march of civilization.
          Occasional Bible texts here and there are illumined by a
          reference to modern customs. But there is a world-wide
          difference in the Nearer East, as elsewhere, between the life
          and spirit of the past and the present. The Bible itself,
          regarded in the light of its own political, social, and
          religious atmosphere, is the great handbook of Biblical
          archeology, whose primary elements, moreover, are not so much
          facts as conditions and principles, such as the inseparable
          relation between God and his people, between the people and the
          land, and between God and the land; the immediate and direct
          action of the Deity in all events and in all phenomena; the
          unity and actual identity of what are called the sacred and the
          secular, of religion and life, or of religion and morals; the
          solidarity of the community as the basis of the State and the
          ground of the responsibility of the individual; and a
          world-consciousness without abstract ideas and to which even God
          himself was the most concrete of realities.

   Archeology, Christian
          ARCHEOLOGY, CHRISTIAN: The science which investigates and
          exhibits the ecclesiastical and religious forms of life and
          conditions of the Christian community for the period terminating
          with the Middle Ages. It may be divided into: (1) Law and
          government, including such topics as constitution, the clergy,
          monasticism, discipline, church law, synods, relations to the
          State, etc.; (2) worship--the various forms of divine service,
          festivals, such acts as baptism, confirmation, the marriage
          ceremony, burial, consecrations (of churches, altars, bells,
          holy water, etc.), benedictions and maledictions, exorcism,
          etc.; (3) art--architecture, painting, sculpture, church
          furniture, burial arrangements, etc.; (4) private and public
          life--the giving of names, marriage, position of women, prayer,
          education, slavery, occupations, corporations and societies,
          amusements, pilgrimages, superstitions, benevolent institutions,
          etc. Church music and books are better treated, it would seem,
          under the head of worship than of art. The sources of Christian
          archeology are the same as for church history. One of the most
          important and the last to receive the attention it deserves is
          furnished by monumental remains.

          The history of the science begins with the first work of
          Protestantism on church history, the "Magdeburg Centuries"
          (1559-74; see [544]Magdeburg Centuries), which, however, makes
          no distinction between archeology and history; the same is true
          of the work of the Roman Catholic scholar, Cæsar Baronius (cf.
          the epitome of Baronius's Annales by C. Schulting, Cologne,
          1601). As an independent science Christian archeology may be
          said to have originated with Joseph Bingham's massive work,
          Origines ecclesiasticæ, or the Antiquities of the Christian
          Church (10 vols., London, 1708-22; see [545]Bingham, Joseph). A
          number of monographs followed during the eighteenth century, and
          during the nineteenth the study was pursued with new vigor. C.

   Arches, Court of
          ARCHES, COURT OF: The court of appeal of the archbishop of
          Canterbury. Its name comes from the original place of the court
          in the vestry of the Church of St. Mary of the Arches, which was
          in the crypt. The judge was originally called the Official
          Principal of the Arches Court, but now is called the Dean of the
          Arches, because the functions of dean and principal have been
          united. The dean once was set over thirteen churches in London,
          which were exempt from the bishop of London's jurisdiction, but
          now he has no such authority as the churches are no longer
          exempt. The office is only titular and the court itself has no
          regular place of meeting but sits in the library of Lambeth
          Palace or in the church house. The court is rarely convened. The
          judge is the only ecclesiastical judge authorized to sentence
          clergymen of the Church of England to deprivation. Appeals from
          the decision of the court are heard by the judicial committee of
          the Privy Council. The present judge (1906) is Sir Arthur
          Charles, appointed by the archbishop of Canterbury in 1899 and
          holding a life office.

   Archevites
          ARCHEVITES, ??r´ke-v?its: The name of a people mentioned only in
          Ezra iv. 9, possibly one of the tribes settled by the Assyrians
          in Samaria (II Kings xvii. 24). While it is possible that the
          name was an official designation, it is better taken as meaning
          "inhabitants of Erech" (see [547]Apharsachites).

   Archicapellanus
          ARCHICAPELLANUS, ??r´´ki-ka-pel´l??-nUs (also called capellanus
          sacri palatii, and by Hincmar of Reims apocrisiarius): The title
          of the principal ecclesiastical dignitary at the court of the
          Frankish sovereigns, who not only presided over the other court
          chaplains but also had the oversight of the court school, and
          from the reign of Louis le Débonnaire (814-840) adjudicated all
          matters of justice at court which affected ecclesiastics. It was
          thus a very influential position. In 856 the archicapellanus was
          put at the head of the court chancery, which had been managed
          under the Merovingian line by a secular commission and under the
          Carolingians by a cancellarius. The combined functions were
          entrusted to Archbishop Liudhard of Mainz in 870, and the title
          archicancellarius became commonly applied to the office, which
          under the Ottos was definitely attached to the see of Mainz. But
          from 1044 the archbishop only bore the latter title, while that
          of archicapellanus once more designated a strictly court
          functionary, whose place was taken after the thirteenth century
          by the [548]almoner.

   Archiereus
          ARCHIEREUS, ?r´´ki-ar´e-Us: A common designation in the Greek
          Orthodox Church for the higher clergy in distinction from the
          other from presbyter down.

   Archimandrite
          ARCHIMANDRITE, ??r´´ki-man´dr?it (Gk. archimandrites, "ruler of
          the fold," mandra, "fold," being applied to a monastic
          association as consisting of the sheep of Christ): A name given
          to the head of a larger monastic community, either the abbot of
          a single monastery or, more in accord with the meaning of the
          word, the general abbot of several monasteries belonging to one
          congregation. The title was in general use in the East as early
          as the fifth century. In the West it is found in the rules of
          Isidore of Seville (vi.) and Columban (vii.), of the latter part
          of the same century. From the tenth century it served as a
          general designation of prelates, even of archbishops. In 1094
          Roger of Sicily put all Basilian monks of Sicily and Calabria
          under an archimandrite, who was later superseded by a secular
          prelate. By a brief of Urban VIII., Feb. 23, 1635, the
          archimandrite of Messina was granted quasiepiscopal
          jurisdiction, the use of the pontificals, and other privileges.
          The abbots of the Greek Uniate Churches in Poland, Galicia,
          Transylvania, Hungary, Slavonia, and Venice also have the title
          "archimandrite." In the Russian Church the archimandrites enjoy
          high honor and wear marks of respect which elsewhere belong only
          to bishops--infuloe, staves, crosses, and the like. They are
          generally under the diocesan bishop, though many had become
          immediately subject to the patriarch of Constantinople or the
          Russian metropolitan previous to the formation of the Holy
          Synod. Consult Du Cange and, for a most exhaustive treatment,

I. General Treatment:

          Christian architecture, as a separate and independent thing,
          exists no more than a Christian state. The conception of a state
          is not altered by the fact that its citizens happen to be
          Christians; nor does architecture receive its essential form
          from being used for Christian or non-Christian purposes. Some of
          the problems of architecture were altered with the advent of
          Christianity, as it had now to build churches instead of
          temples, one of the most important tasks ever laid upon
          architecture, and in fact for many centuries almost the only
          important one. The first question to be considered is the origin
          of this problem, the origin, that is, of specially designed
          church buildings.

  1. The First Places of Worship.

          The oldest documents referring to Christian worship show that
          the faithful assembled in the house of some member of the
          Church. At Jerusalem they met from house to house (Acts ii. 46);
          at Troas in an upper room (Acts xx. 7-8); Paul designated
          Christian Gaius as the host of the whole church of Corinth (Rom.
          xvi. 23), implying that when they came together as a church,
          they met in his house. The mention of upper rooms does not prove
          that such were the only parts of the houses in which these
          gatherings took place; and we must remember that these houses
          were usually the small houses of poor people, constructed in the
          usual manner of the Greco-Roman world. Since the rooms were
          generally small, there would be no place for the assembly as
          soon as it got beyond a small number, except in the atrium or
          court-yard; the contention that divine worship could not have
          been held there, because the sacred mysteries would have been
          exposed to profane eyes, can not be upheld, as the [549]arcani
          disciplina is of later growth. This domestic worship was in
          harmony with the spirit of early Christianity, full as it was of
          ideas of one family of brethren. A Christian house was the ideal
          place for it. The primitive Church, therefore, lacked not only
          the means but the motive to erect any special building for
          divine worship; it had no temples, and expressly rejected the
          idea of building them (cf., e.g., Minucius Felix, Octavius, x.,
          xxxii.).

  2. The First Special Buildings.

          Nevertheless, it was not long before special buildings were
          erected for worship, and considered holy. To understand the
          change, it is necessary to try to fix the date at which this
          took place. Unquestionably special places existed in Alexandria
          in the time of Origen (cf. his "On Prayer," xxxi. 5, Berlin ed.,
          p. 398); but the date may be put further back by observation of
          the popular use of the term ekklesia. In classical Greek meaning
          an assembly of citizens, it came in Christian use to denote,
          first the gathering of the believers, then the Christian
          community either local or universal, and finally the
          meeting-place. This last use is common by the beginning of the
          fourth century; it is found in Eusebius and in his Latin
          contemporary Lactantius (De mort. persec., xii., p. 186, ed.
          Brandt and Laubmann). But still earlier, Clement of Alexandria
          (Strom., vii. 5, p. 846, ed. Potter), Hippolytus (In Dan., i.
          20, p. 32), and Tertullian (De idol., p. 36), shortly before or
          shortly after the year 200, all apply the word to a distinctly
          recognized place of worship. The two latter also call it "the
          house of God." The Greek term kyriakon (Eng. "church"), with its
          Latin equivalent dominicum, appears somewhat later. But by about
          200 there were at least two recognized names for a Christian
          place of worship, and the existence of a name demonstrates the
          prior existence of the thing. Whether these buildings belonged
          to the community or to individual Christians can scarcely be
          answered with certainty for the third century; the theory of
          corporate ownership is doubtful at the beginning of this period,
          though it becomes demonstrable toward the close. The edict of
          Constantine and Licinius, given in Eusebius, Hist. eccl., x. 5,
          in 313 assumes a generally recognized corporate possession of
          many Christian meeting-places.

  3. Changes Demanded by Altered Circumstances of Christians.

          Between the spring of 58, when Gaius was receiving the church of
          Corinth in his house, and the time about 200, when a Christian
          goes into a special "house of God," Christianity had ceased to
          be the close brotherhood which it was at first; it had developed
          a complicated organization, with a marked distinction between
          clergy and laity; the conceptions of priest and sacrifice had
          won a place. And as the body changed, so did its worship; the
          place which had sufficed for the simple, informal gatherings of
          the first Christians was no longer adequate.

  4. Origin of the Christian Basilica.

          The next question, as to the form of these earliest distinct
          churches, is one which it is impossible to answer certainly from
          direct tradition. But it can not be avoided, because on it
          depends another, as to the origin of the Christian basilica,
          than which there is none more important in the whole range of
          ecclesiastical archeology. The basilica has an influence on the
          development of church architecture to the present day, and this
          development is unintelligible without an attempt to arrive at a
          theory of the origin of this structural form. Its definition is
          not matter of controversy; it is an oblong building, divided by
          rows of pillars into three (or sometimes five) aisles, the
          central one the highest and covered with a flat roof, with a
          projecting addition, generally semicircular, more rarely square,
          at one end. When, however, it is asked how such a building came
          to be constructed for Christian worship, there is no such
          possibility of agreement. It has been held to have originated
          from the forensic basilica or the so called private basilica;
          from the Roman dwelling-house or the cella cimiterialis; and
          from the demands of Christian worship by a new creation. The
          limits of an article like the present preclude minute
          examination of these various theories; but obvious objections
          lie against all of them, as they are expressed by their
          defenders. The most certain fact in this whole discussion is
          that when the Church was established under Constantine, it did
          not need to go in search of a form for its buildings; the form
          already existed, substantially the same in all parts of the
          empire. It is not too much to say that we are forced to consider
          the form found in the beginning of the fourth century as the
          product of a long course of development. From what has been
          said, it follows that this development took place approximately
          from 180 to 300. Eusebius (Hist. eccl., viii. 1, 5) indicates,
          that before 260 the churches were what we might call small
          oratories, but increased in size after that date--though this
          increase must not be exaggerated; the facts that the famous
          church of Nicomedia could be razed to the ground in a few hours
          (Lactantius, De mort. persec., xii., p. 187; Athanasius, Apol.
          ad Const., xv., ed. Maur, i. 1, p. 241), and that the churches
          of Treves and Aquileia needed to be replaced by larger buildings
          as early as 336, show that it was only relative. Thus, though
          the hypothesis of a development from the private house of the
          earliest age is attractive, it does not lead directly to the
          basilican form, which in its essence requires a considerable
          size; a basilica for one or even two hundred people could not
          have been constructed. What we need, and what these various
          theories do not provide, is an intermediate stage.

  5. First Step toward a Church Building.

          A direct prescription as to church-building is found for the
          first time in a fourth century passage incorporated with the
          Apostolic Constitutions (II. lvii. 3), which shows what was then
          regarded as essential. This was very little; it is limited to a
          marking of the distinction between clergy and laity, and a
          special place for the bishop. Accordingly, the place set apart
          for the clergy was a more or less fixed dimension; its form
          might vary--it might be made either by the cutting off of one
          end, or by the addition of a semicircular or oblong space, in
          the middle of which was the bishop's seat. That the semicircular
          or apsidal form finally prevailed is due partly to acoustic
          considerations--the bishop preached from his throne--and partly
          to the esthetic motive which made this form a popular one in the
          architecture of the imperial period. The space assigned to the
          laity, as long as they were comparatively few in number, could
          only be a simple oblong, the form which appears as normal in the
          Apostolic Constitutions. This general type, of a simple oblong
          room with an apse at one end, may safely be taken as that of the
          churches which after 260 were demolished or abandoned. None of
          them is preserved; but churches like Santa Balbina in Rome and
          that of Hidra in Africa show that this form did not at once
          disappear even when the basilica became the recognized type. The
          Hidra church is particularly instructive; it is square and
          small--if the measurements given by Kraus are correct, the sides
          are only about 20 feet, with a corresponding apsidal
          presbyterium. This is the church for not more than 100 people
          which we need for our intermediate stage.

  6. Second Step.

          The development from this to the basilica falls probably in the
          period between 260 and 303, which was marked by great activity
          in building. The motive of the change was the need for more
          space; the problem was, how to attain this end without upsetting
          the recognized plan of an oblong auditorium with an added apse
          for the clergy. The proportional lengthening of the main hall
          could not go far, as the extension of the width was limited. The
          only thing to do was to break up the width, and thus came a
          division of aisles. The final solution, that of a wide central
          division with narrower side aisles, does not seem to have been
          reached at once; the basilica at Hidra shows the singular
          arrangement of side aisles wider than the middle section. A
          period of experiment must have come first; but, given the
          division, both esthetic and practical considerations inevitably
          suggested the plan finally adopted. The middle section being the
          main division, its raising to a greater height followed, for
          purposes of lighting, especially since other buildings must have
          frequently stood on each side of the church. This arrangement
          was not new; it has been found, for example, in the temples of
          Hierapolis and Samothrace; and thus it is not surprising that
          the same or a similar solution of the problem was found
          simultaneously in different places--though it probably required
          some time for this solution to be universally recognized as the
          best, as it was in the fourth century. The designation of
          churches as basilicas must have begun in the third century,
          since it is already a familiar term at the beginning of the
          fourth. This transition was the easier because the original
          meaning of the word had been practically superseded by what was
          nearly the sense of our word "hall."

  7. Church-Building Activity after 313.

          With the reign of Constantine begins the building of large and
          splendid churches, through his encouragement and the activity of
          the bishops, first in the East, later in Rome and the West. The
          earliest was the church at Tyre under Licinius; then follow,
          under Constantine, the buildings at Jerusalem, Bethlehem, Mamre,
          Constantinople, Nicomedia, Heliopolis, and perhaps St. Peter's
          in Rome. None of these remains; the oldest large basilicas
          extant, Santa Maria Maggiore in Rome and the churches of
          Ravenna, belong to the fifth and sixth centuries. Thus we are
          dependent on the descriptions of the lost buildings, the first
          of which is the unfortunately too rhetorical account given by
          Eusebius (Hist. eccl., x. 4) of the church at Tyre. According to
          this picture, it corresponded in essential details to the type
          of basilica found in Africa and the West; but we learn from the
          latter not to suppose that everything described by Eusebius was
          uniformly present.

  8. Basilica Style Reproduced.

          Though the adoption of the basilican style did not exclude
          creative freedom on the part of the architect, no further
          development of the idea ever took place in the Roman empire.
          Here, as in other things, we see the powerless despair which
          contented itself with endless reproductions of an accepted type,
          and reproductions which were successively poorer. The basilican
          style in itself, however, was capable of development to a marked
          degree. Among the artistic creations of the ancient world, it
          was the one which was destined to have the greatest future. It
          is conceived wholly in the ancient spirit, as is shown
          particularly in the feeling for space which regulated its
          dimensions. The relation of height to length and breadth shows
          that the beauty of the building was sought in broad, dignified
          extent. That it grew up in an era of decaying art is evident on
          the face of it. Only in the rows of columns which divide the
          aisles is constructive necessity made to minister to beauty;
          nowhere in the rest of the building is there any attempt to
          please. There is nothing more depressing in the history of
          architecture than the straight brick walls, only broken here and
          there by a few small windows, that enclose it. Decoration of a
          sumptuous kind partly makes us forget this poverty; but the
          decoration is purely arbitrary, extraneous, not required by the
          nature of the plan.

  9. Change to Circular Buildings.

          The basilica, then, was the normal type of churches built to
          hold congregations assembled for worship. But these were not the
          only ecclesiastical buildings thought of after the fourth
          century. Special ritual observances or the desire to display
          princely pomp brought about the use of the circular structure,
          which became the normal one for baptisteries and memorial
          chapels. As to the former, when we remember that adult baptism
          was frequent, that immersion was customary; and that the
          observance of regular seasons for baptism made the number of
          candidates large, we see that a comparatively large pool was
          required; and the building constructed to enclose it naturally
          allowed for placing it in the center, and so could be only
          circular. The building of memorial churches was begun by
          Constantine with that of the Holy Sepulcher at Jerusalem, and
          again the circular or polygonal form was proscribed by its
          relation to the sacred object or the tomb which they were
          intended to enshrine. The simple structure might be enriched by
          a number of small chapels or niches, or surrounded by a
          corridor; a cupola or dome necessarily covered it. Here it was
          not so much the working out of a new form as the adaptation of
          one already existing; even when the chapels were prolonged so as
          to make the ground-plan into a Greek cross, it was scarcely a
          new form. Examples are the Lateran baptistery and the two at
          Ravenna, the tombs of Galla Placidia and Theodoric at Ravenna,
          and the church of Santa Costanza in Rome.

  10. Memorial Churches.

          When an attempt was made to use these buildings for general
          purposes of worship, a new problem arose in the laying out of
          the approved places for clergy and people. Churches of this type
          were used in the East for congregational purposes as early as
          Constantine's reign; according to Eusebius's description (Vita
          Const., iii. 50, p. 207), that which the emperor built at
          Antioch was apparently an octagonal building surmounted by a
          cupola, and so was the one put up by the father of Gregory
          Nazianzen in his see city (Orat., xviii. 39, MPG, xxxv. 1037),
          while Gregory of Nyasa (Epist., xxv., MPG, xlvi. 1093) describes
          a similar one. But we know nothing of the interior arrangements
          of these. Later (not before the second half of the fifth
          century) comes the puzzling church of Santo Stefano Rotondo on
          the Celian Hill, whose size proves that it was meant for public
          worship. This, the ugliest building of the kind ever
          constructed, only shows how far the Roman architect was from
          understanding his task; he built a church as he would have built
          a memorial chapel, without realizing the total difference in
          requirements. Yet, in spite of all the difficulties presented by
          this form, especially by the absence of perspective when the
          altar was placed in the middle, a certain number of churches
          were built with which no basilica can compare in beauty--really
          the highest achievements of the older ecclesiastical
          architecture. The best of these is San Vitale at Ravenna (early
          sixth century). Here one of the eight chapels is removed, and a
          longer apse put in its place, which gives a certain effect of
          length--though only by a disturbance of the harmony of the
          original plan. Much more admirable is the solution found in the
          church of Sts. Sergius and Bacchus, and, more completely, in St.
          Sophia, both in Constantinople. But here the essence of this
          central form of structure is not only disturbed, as in San
          Vitals--it is absolutely abandoned. In the Greek and Russian
          churches the domed church became the accepted type, after the
          model of St. Sophia. The ground-plan of the latter was not
          commonly followed, the cruciform being preferred; and thus, when
          each arm of the cross was surmounted with its cupola, as well as
          the central space, they became simply a number of similar
          connecting rooms, and the main attraction of the type, its
          impressive unity, was lost.

  11. Basilica the Accepted Type of Western Medieval Churches.

          The new peoples who were to carry on the work of civilization
          during the Middle Ages inherited in the basilica a type capable
          of great development, though not, as it came to them, much
          developed. It was the only type which had great influence on
          medieval architecture. The men of the Middle Ages were by no
          means blind to the attractions of the style which we call the
          Byzantine; but the attempts made in that style, as by
          Charlemagne at Aachen in imitation of San Vitale, and by others
          after the Church of the Holy Sepulcher had aroused the
          admiration of the crusaders, were only sporadic; they did not
          determine the future progress of ecclesiastical architecture,
          which has the basilica for its true starting-point.

  12. Combination of Basilica and Domed Styles.

          It is worth while to examine the attitude of the different
          modern nations toward this inheritance of the past. In Rome
          building activity was never at a standstill, though a large part
          of it was mere restoration. But for six centuries after Gregory
          the Great (d. 604), people did not conceive the idea that they
          could build otherwise than as their fathers had built. The new
          churches of the twelfth and early thirteenth centuries, Santa
          Maria in Trastevere and San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, simply
          reproduce the scheme of the basilica; yet when Honorius III.
          (1216-27) began the latter, Gothic churches had been building in
          France for more than fifty years. Rome, then, has nothing to do
          with the history of medieval church architecture. The rest of
          Italy was not quite so unfruitful. Tuscany is far from poor in
          admirable medieval buildings. These are partly in the old line
          of development--San Miniato at Florence, for all its attractive
          features, shows no trace of new constructive ideas--and partly
          carry it further. This is especially the case with the cathedral
          of Pisa, which is not only the most successful example of what
          Tuscan artists could do in the handling of large masses and in
          richness of decoration, but carries the basilican principle a
          distinct step further. It is enlarged into a frankly cruciform
          shape, and carries the principal feature of the Byzantine style,
          the dome. But, however celebrated are the beauties of this
          cathedral, one can not deny that the combination of these two
          widely different forms is less successful here than in San
          Vitale and St. Sophia. There is an especially irreconcilable
          antagonism between the dome and the flat roof of the nave. The
          cathedral of Pisa does not unfold the possibilities latent in
          the basilican type--it merely attaches to this type a foreign
          element. In the north of Italy a more decisive forward step was
          taken, when its architects boldly faced the problem of the
          vaulting of the basilica. The answer was not found at once. In
          Sant' Ambrogio at Milan the execution of the vaulting is at the
          expense of the lighting of the nave, and the church is gloomy in
          spite of Italian suns. San Michele at Pavia and the cathedral of
          Parma were the first to succeed in obviating this defect.

  13. The Romanesque Basilica.

          But the progress of wide development of the basilican scheme is
          not connected with the Lombard churches it goes on across the
          Alps, where from the Frankish period its course is
          uninterrupted. Its first effort was the so called Romanesque
          basilica, though the name is modern and not very satisfactory.
          The development of this second important type is not as obscure
          as that of the original basilica but here, too, difficulties
          abound. The weakest feature of the old basilica was the
          arrangement of the transverse section; and it was here that the
          innovators took up the task. Cruciform basilicas had been built
          in the Frankish kingdom even before Charlemagne; and the
          emphasis laid upon this shape leads us to think that symbolic
          more than artistic considerations determined its adoption. Yet
          the esthetic gain was considerable. It led to the lengthening of
          the choir or chancel into a harmonious proportion to the total
          length of the church. The raising of the choir above the level
          of the nave has been thought to have originated in the
          increasing veneration of relics; altars had long been erected
          over the graves of the martyrs, but now the narrow crypts of the
          earlier period gave place to larger chapels, with the result
          indicated. Possibly the same motive led to the addition of a
          second apse at the western end of the church, which was, in any
          case, a step toward connecting the church and the tower. Towers
          had not been a part of the original basilica, except in some
          cases in Syria. At the very beginning of the Middle Ages,
          without, it would seem, any influence from the East, the oldest
          towers begin to appear in Italy--unlovely erections in the shape
          of a cylinder or a parallelepiped, which display the inability
          of the period to construct an architectural work divided into
          well-related parts. No attempt was made to connect them with the
          church. In the Frankish kingdom the construction of towers is at
          least as old as in Italy--in any case pre-Carolingian; but here
          we meet with attempts to break up the unwieldy mass and to place
          it in relation to the church. Another change was in the supports
          of the roof. The old columns were replaced by heavier pillars,
          capable of bearing a greater weight; and this was again a step
          in advance. The use of columns in the basilicas was a
          degradation of this fine element of classical architecture,
          which was not designed to support the lofty walls of the nave of
          the Christian church. The architects of the fourth and fifth
          centuries were insensible to the discordance between their form
          and their use; but whether or not the German innovators felt it,
          they removed it. The tendency to go beyond tradition thus showed
          itself in the most various ways in the Frankish empire; how far
          it had gone by the first half of the ninth century may be seen
          in the plans of St. Gall. The final result was the Romanesque
          basilica which dominated all the Christian countries north of
          the Alps.

  14. Variations in the Detail of the Romanesque Basilica.

          Though, however, there is this general agreement in type, each
          country developed along its own lines. The most instructive
          illustrations may be taken from France and Germany. In the
          latter country the plan of the old basilica was preserved in
          these particulars: The threefold division of the congregation's
          part, the raising and direct lighting of the nave, the flat
          roof, and the termination of the whole building in an apse or
          choir. Four main features were new. The first is the preference
          for the cruciform structure, from which sprang the establishment
          of fixed proportions for the whole church; the square formed by
          the intersection of the two arms of the cross was taken as the
          unit, to be repeated once on each of three sides, and twice or
          three times on the other. The second new feature is the
          connection of the tower or towers with the church, so that under
          various arrangements, with one, two, or more towers, the aim was
          always to present them as an integral part of the building. The
          third point is that the attention was no longer concentrated on
          the interior; by the development of façades and doorways, by the
          breaking up and diversifying of the wall-surface, the exterior
          of the church took on a new character of imposing beauty.
          Fourthly, the individual elements of the whole were freely
          worked over and transformed. The old models were not cast
          aside--the acanthus capital was imitated for a long time--but
          new forms, appropriate both to the material and to the special
          end in view, were boldly created. Outside, however, of these
          general characteristics, there was the greatest freedom in
          design. In one place an apse was added on the eastern side of
          each transept, forming a termination to the side aisles. In
          another, the side aisles were carried out beyond the transept,
          and then terminated each by an apse. In a third, these aisles
          were curved around the main apse, and relieved by smaller
          apsidal formations projecting from the curve. Here the
          semicircular apse was employed; there the polygonal shape was
          preferred, or the old rectangular preserved. The same freedom is
          found in the supports; sometimes columns still uphold the roof
          of the nave, sometimes pillars, or an alternation of both. The
          presence or absence of galleries afforded scope for infinite
          variety. This is what gives the Romanesque basilica not the
          least of its charms. No style excludes mere slavish copying of
          models more than this; none offered greater opportunities to the
          artistic imagination.

  15. The Vaulted Church.

          And yet the flat-roofed basilica was only a preparation for a
          still higher form--the vaulted church. It was probably less
          artistic dissatisfaction with the flat roof that brought about
          the change than a desire to secure protection against fire by
          substituting stone vaulting for a wooden roof. Medieval
          histories are full of accounts of devastating conflagrations in
          the principal churches. The change was made gradually; after
          architects had tried their hands at vaulting the side aisles,
          they came in 1097 to carry a vault over the broad nave of the
          cathedral of Spires. Cross-vaulting was here employed, thus
          distributing the weight of the vault among four supporting
          pillars. The example was soon followed in Mainz and Worms, in
          the abbey church of Laach, and elsewhere; and the advantages of
          this style were speedily recognized.

          Besides the new possibility of reaching a strictly symmetrical
          disposition of the ground-plan, other changes came in. The great
          Romanesque churches were usually monastic or collegiate, and
          thus served not only for the worship of the laity in general but
          also for the daily offices of canons or monks. Consequently, in
          opposition to the natural arrangement of the building, the choir
          was cut off from the nave by a high stone screen in many of
          these churches, and served for the offices, a special altar for
          the worship of the laity being often erected at the east end of
          the nave. The rood-screen sometimes bore a lofty platform for
          reading the Scriptures to the congregation assembled in the
          nave, the lectorium. The connectin of the monastic or collegiate
          buildings with the church led to the laying out of cloisters,
          around a rectangular court, one side of which was frequently
          formed by the church.

  16. Differences between the Ancient and Romanesque Basilica.

          If the Romanesque basilica in its final form is compared with
          the ancient, a notable difference will be observed. The idea of
          length prevailed in the earlier conception; the eye was led on
          entering at once to the altar and the presbyterium behind it.
          The later style did not abandon the idea of length, but modified
          it greatly; the disposition of all spaces is conditioned by the
          principle of grouping. The place for the congregation is not a
          single unbroken space like the central division of the old
          basilica, but a group of small rectangular spaces; the eye does
          not go directly, but by a succession of steps, to the altar. So
          the small apses were grouped about the main apse, the side
          aisles about the nave, the place for the congregation with the
          place for the clergy. The same idea of grouping prevails equally
          in the exterior. It is upon this quality that the picturesque
          character of the Romanesque basilica and its real superiority
          over the ancient rests, for art requires rhythm rather than mere
          uniformity.

  17. French Ecclesiastical Development.

          If we turn to France, the story is different in a number of
          particulars. Instead of the gradual, almost logical development
          of Germany, we see there a bewildering richness of forms and
          motives. The tendency there also was from the flat roof to the
          vaulted; not only, the date of the change, however, varies in
          different parts of France--this was so also in Germany--but the
          final result also differs in different places. In the south, to
          render vaulting possible, they abandoned the path followed since
          the third century, and went back to the single hall, covering it
          with barrel-vaulting (cathedral of Orange), and went from that
          to a cruciform plan (Montmajour); or they retained the threefold
          division, but gave up the raising of the central section, making
          three barrel-vaulted sections of nearly equal height (St. Martin
          d'Ainay at Lyons, nave of St. Nazaire, Carcassonne). Besides
          barrel-vaulting the cupola was frequently employed, without,
          however, adopting the ground-plan of the centralized structures;
          in some places a long nave was covered with a succession of
          equal cupolas (Cahors, Angoulême). The north, however, held
          firmly to the basilica. As in Germany, the way to vaulting was
          prepared by the strengthening of the supports; columns gave way
          to round or square pillars. Cross-vaulting was frequently used,
          but not as exclusively as in Germany; the half-barrel was
          especially used in Burgundy (Cluny, Paray-le-Monial, Autun).
          Barrel-vaulting really answered more nearly to the original
          plan, adapted as it is to the preservation of the impression of
          length. But since the ground-plan was generally similar to the
          German, the result was not altogether harmonious.

  18. Introduction of the Gothic Style.

          After the twelfth century, the predominance of the Romanesque
          basilica was first endangered and then altogether broken down by
          the introduction of the Gothic style. This name again, invented
          by the ignorant vanity of the Italians, is admittedly
          unsatisfactory, but there is no accepted substitute for it. The
          origin of the Gothic style may be traced in the simplest way to
          the effort to find the best manner of forming the
          cross-vaulting; but its universal acceptance throughout so large
          a part of Europe shows that it must have provided what the age
          was unconsciously seeking. The north of France is its
          birthplace. The preliminary steps were taken at Saint-Denis
          under Abbot Suger (1140-44); here first the walls lost all
          significance as supporting elements, and were only retained to
          enclose the space. This is really the essential point of the
          Gothic style--so to construct the vaulting, and so to support
          the superstructure by buttresses as to render the roof
          independent of the walls, and also, by the use of pointed
          arches, of the rectangular floor-space. Free disposition of
          space was won, but little use was made of it. The relation of
          the middle to the side aisles remained the same as in the
          Romanesque; so did the enrichment of the choir by radiating
          chapels, and the greater height of the nave. But while the main
          features of both ground-plan and elevation were still the same,
          all the individual parts were new and harmonious with each
          other. The introduction of the pointed arch in the vaulting led
          to its adoption for all arches. It has been said that in this
          style the vertical principle reached its extreme development;
          but this is misleading. The Gothic cathedral is essentially a
          structure of length, as much as the churches that went before
          it. The choir which terminates it is as much as ever the
          principal member, to which the arches of the nave lead the eye.
          The fact that in the facades of the French cathedrals the
          vertical lines are everywhere broken by horizontal elements can
          not be taken as an inconsistency--these most perfect specimens
          of Gothic art are not likely to have violated a Gothic
          principle. All we can say is that the development of height
          which was present in the Romanesque is continued in the Gothic.
          This bold soaring into the air was taken as symbolic of
          spiritual aspiration; it was a logical consequence which fitted
          the age of the schoolmen. Growing wealth and luxury also found
          their satisfaction in the increased beauty of the design.

  19. Its Adoption in France and Germany.

          The enthusiastic approval of the new style showed itself first
          in France. Simultaneously with Saint-Denis the rebuilding of the
          cathedral of Sens was begun; that of Notre Dame in Paris
          followed in 1163, that of Reims in 1210, and a few years later
          that of Amiens. In less than a century the most perfect works of
          the new style were completed or under way. From France it passed
          almost immediately across the Channel, though in England it took
          on a distinct character by the infusion of Norman elements. In
          Germany there was a period of transition. Certain elements were
          gradually introduced, as in the nave of Bamberg and the choir of
          Magdeburg. Its complete victory dates from the beginning of the
          thirteenth century; by the middle of that century was begun the
          cathedral of Cologne, of which it must at least be said that it
          carries out Gothic principles with an unsurpassed logical
          fulness. But this very completeness was a reason why the
          ambitious architects of those ages were unwilling to rest in it.
          Numerous variations were afterward introduced, many of which
          really led away from Gothic principles while they retained
          Gothic features. By the suppression of the triforium the wall
          regained its place; the abandonment of side aisles in other
          places, the construction of a single large hall, even sometimes
          with a flat roof, vindicated once more the claims of breadth as
          against height, in a way which seems to appeal to modern
          feeling, if one may judge from the praise bestowed upon these
          buildings of really very varying artistic value.

          Italy never did more than play with the Gothic style. Unlike the
          northern architects, who looked upon it as a solution of a
          problem which had long puzzled them, the Italians merely
          imported it as a foreign fashion, partly under the influence of
          the mendicant orders. It opened new possibilities to the fancy
          of Italian architects, but they never made it their own.

  20. No Present Single Predominant Type.

          After the downfall of Gothic predominance, there is no longer
          any unity of development. The tendencies of the Renaissance led
          away from Romanesque and Gothic, rather in the direction of the
          early basilica; and one of its great services to ecclesiastical
          architecture is its conquest of the domed or circular church,
          displayed most fully in St. Peter's at Rome. But the artists of
          this period also succeeded in using this form for parochial and
          smaller churches. It was one of the weakest points about Gothic
          that it was incapable of producing a masterpiece on a small
          scale. Here the Renaissance masters excelled it; in the Badia at
          Florence, San Giovanni delle Monache at Pistoia, and especially
          the Madonna di San Biagio at Montepulciano they gave evidence
          that greatness of line was possible with moderate dimensions.
          This was a distinct gain; but the further development is not
          pleasant to record, either on the Catholic or the Protestant
          side. The former, after the Counterreformation, is characterized
          by display, by a struggle after magnificence, and a loss of
          feeling for the beauty of simplicity and quiet grandeur. The
          development of general art in the baroco and rococo styles
          corresponded to this weakness, and produced the eighteenth
          century barbarities of vulgar ostentation. Modern styles have
          also had their influence on Protestant church-building, but no
          one form has attained a recognized mastery.

          (A. Hauck.)

II. English Ecclesiastical Architecture:

          Some able attempts have been made in recent years to limit the
          term "Gothic" to buildings of the highest and most developed
          type, churches, in short, erected within the narrow confines of
          the Royal Domain of France. The contention is perhaps one of
          terms rather than of facts. At least it is certain that if the
          highest type of Gothic is that of the Royal Domain--which is
          unquestionably true--the art had a very wide distribution
          throughout Europe. This was brought about partly by the bands of
          traveling craftsmen, who journeyed from city to city, from
          country to country, and by the natural desire to build in the
          new style, which was copied wherever its beauties and structural
          qualities were known.

          But while it is not difficult to trace the new style to its
          point of origin in the Royal Domain, it speedily lost its
          essentially French characteristics in taking root in new soil.
          The Gothic of the various countries of Europe exhibits
          distinctive characteristics of its own, which not only
          differentiate it from the Gothic of the Royal Domain, but give
          it a character and feeling, almost a form thoroughly national
          and individual. Of few countries is this more clearly the case
          than England, whose Gothic monuments are among the most splendid
          in Europe and exhibit some of the most remarkable manifestations
          of this beautiful style.

  1. Romanesque Architecture.

          Normandy Romanesque appeared in England before the Conquest. It
          began with the commencement of Westminster Abbey by Edward the
          Confessor in 1065. For the next hundred years the building art
          of England was a development of the art of Normandy, but richer,
          more complete, more varied, and with a much more numerous series
          of monuments. Most of the Anglo-Saxon churches were rebuilt
          completely, and many wholly new churches and foundations
          erected, many of them of great size.

  2. Introduction of Gothic.

          A new epoch in English architecture was occasioned by the
          introduction of the Cistercian Order about 1140. Between 1125
          and the end of the twelfth century more than a hundred
          Cistercian abbeys were founded in England. Until about 1175 the
          larger share of the work was done by the monks and canons
          regular; at that date the secular canons became the leaders in
          building, and the English Gothic monuments were chiefly built by
          them. Hence the larger number of English Romanesque churches was
          due to the regular orders, while the Gothic churches are chiefly
          the work of the secular canons. Yet England saw no such
          wholesale destruction of Romanesque monuments as happened in
          France. There, many great Romanesque churches were completely
          rebuilt in the newer Gothic. In England, on the contrary, many
          extensive Romanesque parts were retained to which Gothic
          additions were made at various periods. The great churches of
          England, therefore, offer very much more variety in style than
          the great churches of France. And this is as true of the smaller
          churches as of the larger. Another interesting fact concerning
          English churches is that most of the greatest churches have
          either always been cathedral churches or are now cathedrals. A
          number of English bishops had their seats in monks' churches,
          while many other monastic churches became cathedrals in the time
          of Henry VIII. or were made so later. The English cathedrals,
          therefore, comprise nearly all of the largest medieval churches
          remaining in England.

  3. Three Periods.

          The classification of English Gothic monuments by periods has
          been a subject of much study. The determinating feature is the
          window tracery, always an essential and characteristic element.
          In a general way three leading periods may be distinguished:
          Early English or Lancet, from 1175 or 1180 to 1280, indicated by
          simplicity, dignity, and purity of design; Decorated or
          Geometric, from 1280 to 1380, characterized by decorative
          richness and greater lightness of construction; Perpendicular,
          from 1380 into the sixteenth century, distinguished by
          fan-vaulting, four-centered arches, and tracery in which
          vertical and horizontal lines strongly predominate.

  4. Characteristics of English Gothic.

          Apart from the special features indicated by this
          classification, English Gothic had certain other general
          characteristics all of which helped materially in producing a
          characteristic style of building. Compared with the churches of
          France those of England were low and long. While the French
          builders delighted in structural experiments, and in the
          cathedral of Beauvais attempted a lightness and delicacy of
          construction which was never surpassed in Europe, those of
          England avoided such dangerous efforts. Their use of the flying
          buttress, a leading and typical feature of French Gothic, was of
          the slightest. But while they did not, because of this, build
          high vaults, they displayed in their vaulting a much greater
          variety and richness than did the French, whose vaults are, in a
          measure, of uniform character. The splendid English vaults are,
          in truth, one of the most notable characteristics of English
          Gothic architecture. The earliest English efforts at decorative
          vaulting are the ribbed vaults, with many ribs rising from a
          common point of origin, presenting many small faces easily
          filled in. The next stage shows minor ribs, called liernes,
          connecting the main ribs and forming star-shaped and other
          patterns. The final type, and the most complex and the most
          beautiful, was the fan-vault, in which the ribs are multiplied
          indefinitely; the vaults are elaborately paneled, and often
          supplied with pendants decorated with ribs. The structural
          significance of the vault is almost lost sight of in these
          enrichments, and the fan-vaulting is a splendid stone ceiling
          rather than a structural roof-covering as is the case with the
          purer earlier vaults or the more logical vaults of France.

          The English builders of the medieval period appear to have
          always had a special predilection toward enriched and decorative
          ceilings. The most beautiful, even if the least structural form
          of stone roofing, was reached in their fan-vaults. Their wooden
          ceilings were equally notable. Many English open-timbered
          ceilings, with decorated trusses and paneled surfaces, are works
          of extraordinary beauty, and thoroughly characteristic of early
          and late English Gothic.

  5. The Smaller English Churches.

          While the history of English Gothic architecture is largely
          written in its cathedrals, the great churches are very far from
          completing the record of English medieval building. The English
          parish church is a thoroughly interesting and highly
          characteristic form of building, often very mixed as to styles
          and dates, most generally small and low in proportions, but
          almost always beautiful in design and charmingly environed. Some
          few of them are churches of great size, but the larger number
          are of modest proportions. The royal and college chapels also
          constitute an important group of typical English churches. The
          royal chapels at Windsor and Westminster, King's College Chapel
          at Cambridge, and Merton College Chapel at Oxford are among the
          most notable achievements of English Gothic architecture. Nor
          should the lesser monuments, the chapels within churches, the
          screens and tombs, be neglected by the student of English
          medieval architecture, for the architectural and sculptured
          parts of these minor structures often exhibit an exquisite
          delicacy of design and remarkable command of decorative forms.

  6. Renaissance Architecture.

          Of churches built in the Renaissance style England has but few.
          The most notable is St. Paul's Cathedral in London. This great
          and splendid church is the masterpiece of Sir Christopher Wren.
          It was begun in 1675 and the uppermost stone was placed on the
          lantern of the dome in 1710. The dome is one of the most
          impressive in Europe and ranks among the greatest domes of the
          world. Wren's churches in the city of London are an important
          group of English churches. Designed in a characterized rendering
          of the classic style, they constitute the last original
          contribution to English church architecture.

  7. Modern English Architecture.

          Modern English church architecture is almost wholly a restudy of
          the architecture of the past. Up to within the last quarter of
          the nineteenth century this study, while often zealously made,
          was without real understanding of the nature of either
          Romanesque or Gothic architecture. Gothic models were copied
          with avidity, and the designers imagined that in copying Gothic
          forms, they were doing all that was necessary to obtain a
          genuinely Gothic building. But the spirit, the feeling, the
          truth of the older art was forgotten or ignored in the new. Even
          the old forms were unintelligently used and the spirit was
          completely wanting.

          Toward the close of the nineteenth century, however, a group of
          London architects attacked the problem of church-building in a
          new way. The old forms were restudied and used as the old
          builders might have used them. A new spirit of reverence in
          church architecture was developed, and a number of notable
          churches built which illustrated a genuine mastery of Gothic
          forms and uses that make the best of recent English churches
          structures truly worthy of attention.

III. Ecclesiastical Architecture in America:

          Ecclesiastical architecture in America is much more a
          reproductive architecture than in any other country. Alone of
          all the great countries of modern times the United States has no
          historic architecture of its own. Great Britain and the
          Continent abound in historic examples of building of every sort,
          but America has nothing that is old save what it itself has
          created. The earliest architecture of America was necessarily
          purely constructive, that is to say, without artistic intent or
          purpose. As the colonies developed, more attention was given to
          the building of churches and meeting-houses, and some of the
          structures erected in this period have genuine interest and real
          merit. But colonial architecture was but the copying of English
          forms, in most cases by untrained men who hardly understood what
          they were copying. The interest which attaches to these
          buildings, which were confined to New England, the eastern, and
          some of the southern States, is often very real, but they offer
          little material for the modern architect, who, even at his best,
          is scarcely more than a copier or a modifier.

          The later history of church architecture in America affords
          little occasion for congratulation. Being without historic
          models of their own, American architects have been forced to use
          the models of Europe as a basis for their church designs. For
          many years this translation of architectural materials was
          accomplished with little credit to all concerned. As in England,
          American architects copied forms without understanding their
          meaning, with results little removed from the commonplace. In
          the last few years a more enlightened conception of the meaning
          and purpose of church architecture has taken root among American
          architects, and some few churches have been built worthy of our
          time and the purpose to which Christian structures are
          dedicated.

   Architecture, Hebrew
          ARCHITECTURE, HEBREW: Before David and Solomon the Israelites
          had no architecture. The present village of Siloah (Silwân) on
          the Mount of Olives furnishes a type of their oldest houses and
          towns; it lies on the steep hillside, and the houses are not
          detached but half caves, the slope of the land making it
          possible to utilize the natural rock for one or more walls.
          Because their subjects did not know how to build houses David
          and Solomon had to import Phenician workmen for their palaces.
          This was probably the beginning of Hebrew architecture. It is
          not probable that a Jeroboam II. did not adorn his capital with
          a palace and temple. In Jerusalem, however, Solomon's structures
          seem to have been the first and last of any size (but cf. Jer.
          xxii. 14), and his operations were too great for the financial
          resources of his land (I Kings ix. 10-23). The prophet Amos (v.
          11) looks upon the building of houses of hewn stone by the rich
          of Israel as something new and reprehensible (cf. Isa. ix. 10).
          After the Exile the Temple was rebuilt with help from Phenicia
          (Ezra iii. 7), but the new structure fell far short of Solomon's
          in splendor and impressiveness. The community was too poor for
          great secular buildings. Not until the days of Hellenism was
          there any building activity, and then the Greco-Roman style
          dominated. It is therefore correct to say that architecture as
          an art never existed among the Hebrews; whenever their building
          was more than a mere mechanical trade they had foreign help.

          Accordingly it is impossible to speak of a Hebrew architectural
          style or school. Nevertheless, Hebrew building had certain
          characteristics, imposed first of all by natural conditions.
          Wood in Palestine was and is scarce and expensive (the beams for
          Solomon's temple had to be imported from Lebanon, I Kings v.
          6-10), and the most available material was the easily worked
          limestone in the mountains, and clay in the lowlands. The house,
          developed from the cave, consisted generally of but one room; it
          was low and had few windows or doors. The clay houses were
          roofed by means of a few unhewn tree trunks, branches, and
          brush, over which a layer of earth was placed and the whole
          covered with a mixture of clay and straw. The stone houses had
          domed roofs; the earliest were made by placing stones on the
          corners and others upon these until the space was covered. But
          the Hebrews early learned to construct arches, probably from the
          Babylonians or Phenicians.

          Solomon's temple was a stone building, wood being used only for
          decoration and the roof. Its massive walls, the absence of
          pillars (the two columns at the entrance bore no weight), and
          the use of great squared stones (I Kings v. 17-18; vii. 9-12)
          are characteristic, and show that wooden structures did not
          furnish the pattern. The Syrians and Phenicians attained great
          skill in building with squared stones; a noteworthy feature is a
          smoothly chiseled or sunken border from two to four inches wide
          about the outer face of each stone. In Solomon's palaces wood
          was more freely used; the "house of the forest of Lebanon" (I
          Kings vii. 2-5) has its name from the fact. Here foreign models
          were evidently followed, which are naturally to be sought in the
          lead from which the wood was brought.

  I. Europe:

    1. Germany.

          The great value and also the extreme importance of
          ecclesiastical records, for historical inquiry as well as in the
          daily life of the minister and other church officials, in former
          times were not properly perceived and appreciated. Works on
          canon law have usually little to say on the subject. Within the
          last few decades, however, the representatives of historical
          theology have pointed out the duty of the Church to attend to a
          careful administration and preservation of its archival
          treasures. A number of provincial synods in Germany, including
          the Austrian general synod, have passed important resolutions in
          that direction, and the later ecclesiastical legislation has
          provided for reorganization of the ecclesiastical archives and
          registry. The archival system of the Moravian Brethren is
          excellent. In 1888-89 a fire-proof building was erected for the
          archives at Herrnhut (cf. A. Glitsch, Versuch einer Geschichte
          der historischen Sammlungen der Brüder-Unitat, Herrnhut, 1891).
          The archives collected in Coblenz in consequence of a resolution
          passed by the eighth Rhenish provincial synod in 1853 are
          arranged in a model way. The interest in the same has steadily
          grown, and since the publication of a catalogue, they have been
          constantly consulted. Those Reformed Dutchmen, who as fugitives
          from Spanish persecution fled from the Netherlands to the
          countries of the Rhine, brought thither their Presbyterian
          church-order and synodical institutions, and taught Germany to
          take care of its ecclesiastical archives.

    2. France.

          The first national synod of the Reformed Church of France held
          at Paris in 1559 enjoined that in every church all important
          matters relating to religion should be registered, that the
          material should be collected by a pastor at each district synod,
          and that the material gathered by each provincial synod was to
          be brought to the general synod. Since that the ecclesiastical
          archives, especially in those parts where the oldest
          constitution after Calvin's idea had been adopted, have been
          carefully kept. The Société pour l'histoire du Protestantisme
          français (founded in 1852) has contributed largely toward their
          preservation and revision.

    3. Holland.

          In Holland, the Walloon general synod appointed in 1878 a
          Commission de l'histoire et de la bibliothéque des églises
          Wallones, which publishes bulletins containing an account of its
          work. The Dutch Reformed Church has adopted some good rules, and
          its archives are in the Willem's Church in the Hague; a
          catalogue is published.

          [The archives of the Classis of Amsterdam, which had charge of
          about twenty colonies in different parts of the world, are kept
          in the Consistory Room of the Oude Kerck. There are here about
          100 volumes in manuscript, and twenty-five portfolios of letters
          from the different colonies. The letters of the classis to the
          colonies are recorded in a succession of volumes, numbered
          xx.-xxxii. (For a full account of these archives, cf.
          Ecclesiastical Records o f the State of New York, 6 vols.,
          printed at the expense of the State of New York, 1901-06, vol.
          i., pp. 18-24.) In the same room are found complete sets of the
          minutes of the Synod of North Holland, in many manuscript
          volumes; also minutes of many of the other provincial synods,
          more or less complete (Ecclesiastical Records, i. 24-25). The
          minutes of the General Synod of Holland are found at 100 Java
          Street, in The Hague. Here also are the original minutes of the
          Synod of Dort, 1618-19; the reports on the translation of the
          Bible, 1637; and the minutes of most of the provincial synods of
          Holland. Consult Ecclesiastical Records, i. 26-27, which give
          many references; also Catalogus van het Oud Synodaal Archief,
          prepared by H. Q. Janssen, minister at St. Anna ter Muiden; with
          the indexes of the Old Provincial Ecclesiastical Archives,
          published by the General Synod of the Netherlands Reformed
          Church, 1878, p. 198. This gives a list of all the books and
          papers in these archives of the General Synod.]

    4. Switzerland, Scandinavia, and England.

          In Switzerland the different cantons look after their archives
          more or less independently (cf. Inventur der Schweizer Archiv,
          herausgegeben auf Veranlassung der allgemeinen
          geschichtsforschenden Gesellschaft der Schweiz, Bern, 1895
          sqq.). In Scandinavian countries the ecclesiastical archives are
          not separated from those of the State, but of late special
          attention has been paid to the former. In England the Reports of
          the Historical Manuscripts Commission (appointed in 1869)
          contain much that is derived from the archives of the
          Established Church. The Huguenot Society of London (founded
          1885) issues valuable publications, and the General Assembly of
          Scotland also pays attention to archival matters.

    5. The Papal Archives.

          After the Magdeburg Centuries proved that the so called
          Isidorian decretals were forgeries, the papal archives became
          almost inaccessible for scientific research until Pope Leo XIII.
          opened them to scholars of all nations, and appointed a
          historical commission to edit and publish them. The
          subarchivists, however, may deny access to works of a familiar
          character or those which it does not seem opportune to publish.

  II. America:

    1. Baptists.

          The American Baptist Historical Society has its headquarters in
          Philadelphia with the American Baptist Publication Society and
          is gathering much valuable material. The Samuel Colgate
          Collection of Baptist documents in connection with Colgate
          University, Hamilton, N. Y., is large and, supported by a good
          endowment, is likely to grow. Several of the States have their
          own Baptist Historical Societies and are collecting documents.
          There is a good deal of material on Texas Baptist history in the
          library of Baylor University at Waco, and the librarian is
          seeking to enlarge the collection. Most of the State Baptist
          colleges and the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary at
          Louisville, Ky., have collections of greater or less importance.
          Regents Park Baptist College, London, probably has more material
          on English Baptist history than any other one institution. A
          collection is also being made at the Baptist Church House,
          Southampton Row, London. The Mennonite library at Amsterdam is
          said to be rich in materials relating to the Mennonites and
          other antipedobaptists.

    2. Congregationalist.

          The polity of the Congregationalists makes each congregation a
          law unto itself and the archives are kept in the congregations.
          In this way much valuable material has never found its way into
          print or even into general knowledge. The Congregational Library
          was founded in Boston in 1853 to be a repository of such
          material, and much has been gathered there. Other valuable
          repositories are Yale University library, which has Henry Martyn
          Dexter's collection; the Massachusetts Historical Society and
          the Prince Library in Boston; and the library of the American
          Antiquarian Society at Worcester. The various state bodies and
          the National Assemblies held at Albany, N. Y., in 1852, in
          Boston in 1865, and triennially since 1871, publish their
          minutes. Since 1854 a Year Book (Boston: Congregational
          Publishing Society) has been published, which gives statistics
          and a list of ministers, etc.

    3. Lutherans.

          Among the Lutherans the Historical Society of the General Synod
          has its collection of documents in the library of the Gettysburg
          (Pa.) Theological Seminary; there is an archivarius of the
          General Council and the archives are in the Krauth library,
          Mount Airy, Philadelphia. By resolution of the Synod of
          Pennsylvania all congregations are requested to have their
          history written up to date and copies deposited in the synodical
          archives; also biographical sketches of all deceased clerical
          members. Valuable material is preserved in Amsterdam; at the
          Gloria Dei Church, Philadelphia; Old Swedes' Church, Wilmington,
          Delaware; and in St. Matthew's German Church, New York City. The
          great source of information relating to the early Lutheran
          history in Pennsylvania is the so called Hallesche Nachrichten,
          or more exactly Nachrichten von den vereinigten deutschen
          evangelisch-lutheranischen Gemeinden in Nord America,
          absonderlich in Pennsylvanien (2 vols., Halls, 1750-87; new ed.
          by Mann; Schmucker, and Germann, vol. i., Allentown, 1886).

    4. Methodist and Moravians.

          The archives of the various branches of Methodists are to be
          sought in the published journals of the General Conferences and
          minutes of the Annual Conferences, also in the written minutes
          of the minor bodies. Collections are in the libraries of the
          denominational publishing houses. The archives of the Moravian
          Church are at Bethlehem, Pa., and embrace the minutes of various
          synods, conferences, etc.

    5. Presbyterians.

          The constitution of the Presbyterian Church in the United States
          requires each one of the church courts, in their regular
          gradation (viz., the church session, presbytery, synod, and
          general assembly) to keep fair and full records of its
          proceedings. Further, the church session, composed of the pastor
          and the ruling elders of a particular congregation, is required
          to submit its records to the next higher judicatory, the
          presbytery; the presbytery submits its records to the synod; and
          each synod submits its records to the general assembly. This
          system secures a proper record in the first place; then corrects
          errors, both as to fact and law; and also introduces uniformity
          of both record and action into all church procedure. The first
          Presbyterian congregations in America were founded early in the
          seventeenth century and the written records of some of them go
          back into that century. The first presbytery was formed in
          Philadelphia in 1706 and its manuscript records are in existence
          with the exception of the first page. The General Synod was
          established in 1717, and its manuscript records are complete.
          The first general assembly met in 1789, and its records are
          likewise intact. Many of the records of the presbyteries and
          synods are published regularly in printed form from year to
          year, and the minutes of the proceedings of the general assembly
          have been published from 1789 to the present time. The complete
          records of the General presbytery, General Synod, and General
          Assembly from 1706 to 1869 have been reprinted in eleven
          volumes, edited by Rev. Dr. Wm. H. Roberts, stated clerk of the
          General Assembly. The volumes from 1870 to date are issued
          separately. The Presbyterian Historical Society, located in the
          Witherspoon Building, Philadelphia, renders invaluable service
          to all Presbyterian and Reformed. Churches in the United States
          by providing proper accommodations for historical records of all
          description.

    6. The Protestant Episcopal Church.

          In the matter of the preservation of its archives, the
          Protestant Episcopal Church has always been careful, having had
          for a number of years a joint commission on archives, consisting
          of prominent members of both houses of the General Convention.
          In addition, there is a historiographer, a custodian of the
          standard Bible and of the standard prayer-book, and, further, a
          recorder of ordinations. Reports from these several officials
          are submitted and published triennially, and efforts are made
          from time to time to add to the already valuable collection of
          archives such material as may appear to be worthy of
          preservation.

    7. The Reformed Churches, Dutch and German.

          The Reformed Church in America (Dutch Reformed Church) has a
          special fire-proof room set apart for its archives in the Sage
          Library at New Brunswick, N. J. Here are deposited all the
          minutes of the coetus, 1737-71; of the old provisional synods,
          1771-99; of the general synod, 1794 to present time; of the four
          particular synods, except the volumes yet in use; of many of the
          classes, all having been invited to deposit their records here;
          and of many of the churches; also, in part, of the benevolent
          boards. Here also are to be found the original documents and
          letters, or transcripts of the same (about 2,000 pages), secured
          by the historian, J. Romeyn Brodhead, in Holland in 1841-43;
          also transcripts of the minutes of the Classis of Amsterdam, and
          of the Synod of North Holland, so far as these relate to
          America; and transcripts of the correspondence between these
          Holland bodies and the churches and early ecclesiastical bodies
          in America, secured by the Rev. Dr. E. T. Corwin, in Holland, in
          1897-98, bound in fifteen volumes, and amounting to about 4,000
          pages. A large part of this material has been printed at the
          expense of the State of New York, in the six volumes styled
          Ecclesiastical Records of the State of New York (1901-06).
          Consult the article Amsterdam Correspondence in the Papers of
          the American Society of Church Hist., viii. (1897), pp. 81-107;

          Constitutional and Synodical Legislation of the Reformed Church
          in America (1906), articles Archives, Amsterdam Correspondence,
          General Synod, Synodical Archives, etc. The Reformed Church in
          the United States (German Reformed Church) has preserved in the
          library of the Historical Society of Lancaster, Pa., transcripts
          of original documents, embracing correspondence with Holland.
          The various synods and classes have also their manuscript
          minutes. Many official documents have been published by the
          several States.

   Arcimboldi, Giovanni Angelo
          ARCIMBOLDI, ??r´´chîm-bol´dî, GIOVANNI ANGELO: Archbishop of
          Milan 1550-55; d. at Milan Apr. 6, 1555. He belonged to an old
          and famous family in Milan, where his father was senator and
          councilor and his uncle archbishop. Before reaching his
          thirtieth year, he was apostolic protonotary and referendary to
          Leo X., who employed him in various financial matters connected
          with the building of St. Peter's, and on Dec. 2, 1514, named him
          commissary-general of the indulgence for a large part of Germany
          and for Scandinavia, with the rank and powers of a legate a
          latere. Another document of September, 1516, entrusted him with
          the functions of a political peacemaker in Sweden. He spent some
          time in North Germany, especially at Lübeck and Hamburg, and
          made full use of his powers, which included various means of
          raising money by the sale of titles and privileges. He then went
          through the diocese of Ratzeburg to Holstein, and came in 1516
          or 1517 to Copenhagen. In return for a payment of 1100 Rhenish
          florins, King Christian granted him license to proclaim his
          indulgences in Denmark. He reached Sweden in March, 1518, having
          promised Christian to work for him and his policy of union
          between the three Scandinavian kingdoms. Sten Sture the younger,
          then viceroy, as leader of the national party, was striving for
          the complete independence of Sweden, and at this time was
          especially involved in a struggle with the prelates of the union
          party; he had forced, sword in hand, the resignation of the
          ambitious and stubborn archbishop Gustav Trolls. At the end of
          the year, Arcimboldi was in Stockholm and Upsala; and Sten Sture
          spared no pains to win over the clever and powerful legate, and
          fully succeeded. At the assembly of Arboga in December, 1518,
          the appointed peacemaker confirmed the canonically unjust
          sentence of the Swedish Diet against Gustav Trolle, induced
          probably by the rich presents he received and by the hope of
          gaining the metropolitan dignity. Meantime he took in large sums
          of money from all Sweden and Norway in return for his
          indulgences. But Christian II. was naturally little pleased with
          the behavior of the legate; besides complaining to the pope, he
          seized his treasures, imprisoned his brother Antonio, and
          threatened to do the same to him. Arcimboldi saved himself by
          flight to Lund, then in Danish territory, whence he passed
          through Sweden again and so back to Lübeck, where the difference
          in big reception showed the approach of the Reformation, and
          where he found affixed to the church-doors a bull obtained from
          the pope by Christian, excommunicating Sten Sture and all who
          had aided him in the deposition of Trolls. He returned to Rome
          and succeeded in changing the pope's views, which was the easier
          as Christian had shown an inclination toward the Reformation,
          and had also (1520) aroused the horror of Europe by beheading a
          large number of Swedish nobles in order to strengthen his
          position. Arcimboldi was not, however, fully restored to favor
          for some years. In return for the influence of his family,
          exerted to win Milan for Charles V., he was made bishop of
          Novara in 1525, and archbishop of Milan in 1550.

   Aretas
          ARETAS, âr´e-tas (later Gk. form Arethas, on coins and
          inscriptions Charethath): The name of four princes of the
          Nabatæan kingdom in the s. and e. of Palestine, whose capital
          was Petra. In the Bible (according to correct readings) only two
          of them are named-in II Macc. v. 8, the earliest of the name
          whom we know, or Aretas I., with whom in 169 B.C. the high
          priest Jason sought refuge from Antiochus Epiphanes; and the one
          who is probably to be designated Aretas IV., mentioned in II
          Cor. xi. 32. According to Josephus (Ant., xviii. 5) his daughter
          was the first wife of Herod Antipas, who was put away to make
          room for Herodias (Matt. xiv. 3 and parallels). This divorce
          caused enmity between him and Herod, and disputes over
          boundaries brought on a war, in which Aretas was victorious (c.
          38 A.D.). At the command of Tiberius, the proconsul of Syria,
          Vitellius, took the field against him; but while the expedition
          was on its way toward Petra, it was recalled by the news of
          Tiberius's death (Mar. 18, 37). It is difficult to determine how
          a "governor" (Gk. ethnarches) under Aretas came to have power at
          Damascus about the same time, as mentioned in II Cor. xi. It is
          unlikely that, as Marquardt and Mommsen conjecture, the city had
          belonged to the Nabatæan territory since the days of Aretas III.
          More probable is the widely held view that Aretas IV. took
          forcible possession of it temporarily before, during, or after
          the expedition of Vitellius, at least during the winter of
          36-37. Another theory is that Caligula, who (unlike his
          predecessors) was unfriendly to Herod, conceded to Herod's
          opponent the sovereignty of the city which had once belonged to
          the Nabatæan princes. Zahn has sought to solve the problem in a
          surprising way by trying to show that this "governor" or
          ethnarch of King Aretas was a Bedouin chief subject to him (cf.
          Schürer, in TSK, lxxiii.,1899, pp: 95 sqq.), who had no
          authority in Damascus, but watched the gates of the city, from
          the outside. Another difficulty is offered by the fact that Luke
          (Acts ix. 23-25) attributes the peril of Paul at Damascus not to
          the ethnarch under Areta, but to the Jews. It is possible,
          however, that the Jews caused the ethnarch's action and also
          watched the gates themselves, but the simplest explanation is
          that Luke mentions them merely as the original instigators. In
          any case the notices give no certain date for Pauline
          chronology; but the event can be approximately fixed in the
          winter of 36-37, if the hypothesis of forcible occupation be
          correct, or after March, 37, if that of investiture by Caligula
          is preferred. But Zahn has made clear that an earlier date is
          not impossible.

   Arethas
          ARETHAS: Archbishop of Cæsarea; b. at Patræ about 860. In the
          light of recent investigations and discoveries he appears as a
          vigorous ecclesiastical ruler in the Byzantine empire, and as a
          powerful promoter of learning, who took up and carried on the
          traditions of the school of Photius. The period of his life was
          one of great interest in scholarship and in the collection of
          the surviving treasures of antiquity. He became archbishop of
          Cæsarea under the Emperor Leo VI. (d. 912), and as such was next
          in rank to the patriarch of Constantinople. He must have lived
          to a good old age, as we have a manuscript letter of his to the
          emperor Romanus (d. 944). In his episcopal capacity, he was a
          defender of orthodoxy as it was understood by Photius. He
          despised both the Nestorians and the "insane" Eutychians, whom
          he classed with the Manicheans; he rejected Tatian's doctrine of
          the Logos as equally heretical with the Arian. The tendency to
          the veneration of relics and of the Virgin Mary appears here and
          there in his works. Both these and his actions display a
          passionate temperament, with an unswerving steadfastness when he
          has once taken a side. Leo VI. came into conflict with the canon
          law by his decision to marry for the fourth time, probably
          induced by the desire for a male heir. The story of this
          conflict (904-907) unfolds a remarkable picture of Byzantine
          polities, as conditioned by the mutual relations of Church and
          State. While the Saracens were threatening the frontier of the
          empire, Leo labored diligently to gain the consent of the
          patriarch Nicholas to his fourth marriage; but Nicholas was
          reluctant to give it, and appealed to the disapproval of Arethas
          in support of his action in refusing to admit the emperor to the
          Church. When the patriarch showed a more conciliatory temper,
          Arethas refused to follow him, and was banished after the
          downfall of Nicholas. He won the latter's successor, Euthymius,
          to his way of thinking, and adhered to his support when Nicholas
          was restored after the death of Leo. Euthymius, after an outward
          reconciliation with his competitor, retired to a life of
          asceticism, dying in 917. The hatred of his enemies pursued him
          even to the grave; but three years later Arethas was able to
          show his constancy by accomplishing the reverential translation
          of his remains. These data for the biography of Arethas are
          illustrated by a number of letters and occasional writings
          collected in the unpublished Moscow Codex 315 (called 302 by
          Matthæi). These show that he held a position of great influence
          in relation not only to the emperors but to all the principal
          political, military, and ecclesiastical leaders. That his life
          was full of controversy appears from the number of his polemical
          writings, directed sometimes to his own vindication from
          personal charges, but more often against the Iconoclasts, the
          Armenian Monophysites, the Jews, or the "babblings" of Lucian
          and Julian. Especially noteworthy is that against his former
          pupil Nicetas of Paphlagonia. But his interests were by no means
          exclusively ecclesiastical, as is shown by a number of
          beautifully written manuscripts which he had prepared for his
          library, and himself completed by introductions, notes, and
          appendices. The most valuable contain works of Euclid,
          Aristides, Plato, Lucian, and Marcus Aurelius, as well as a
          collection of Christian apologists down to Eusebius, which in
          many cases supplies the primary text. The notes vary in value,
          but show a wide knowledge of Greek and Alexandrian literature,
          and contain many remarks of historical, antiquarian, and
          lexicographic importance. The principal work of Arethas's own
          composition is his commentary on the Apocalypse, written
          probably after 913, and based upon the earlier commentary of
          Andrew of Cæsarea. It is not, however, a mere compilation, but
          contains a large amount of new observations and quotations from
          other sources, increasing it, for the early chapters, to more
          than double the length found in Andrew. The exegetical
          standpoint is the same; Arethas takes it for granted that the
          Apocalypse contains revelations from the world beyond, and finds
          in each prominent word the possibility of manifold references to
          past and future history, though holding firmly that these
          interpretations must be justified by the rest of Scripture and
          by pure Christian thought. The text of his commentary is in MPG,
          cvi. 487-786, and in Cramer, Catena Groecorum patrum in Novum
          Testamentum, viii. (Oxford, 1844), pp. 176-582. Few of his other
          works have been published.

   Argentina
          ARGENTINA: A South American republic, bounded on the north by
          Bolivia and Paraguay, on the east by Paraguay, Brazil, Uruguay,
          and the Atlantic Ocean, on the south by the Atlantic, and on the
          west by the Andes, which separate it from Chile. It is divided
          into fourteen provinces and nine territories (gobernaciones),
          and has an area of 1,125,100 square miles and a population of
          about 4,200,000. The capital is Buenos Ayres (permanently
          founded, 1580). The republic had its origin in a struggle
          against Spain which broke out in 1810 and was an outcome of the
          Napoleonic interference in the mother country. The constitutive
          assembly was replaced in 1818 by a constitution, although the
          war with Spain did not end until 1824. This constitution, as
          amended in 1860, provides for a congress of two chambers, the
          Senate and the Deputies, and each province has also an elected
          assembly for its own government.

          The constitution declares the state religion to be Roman
          Catholic and requires the president or his substitute to be of
          that faith, but establishes the right of governmental exequatur
          for all papal mandates, and grants other creeds the free
          exercise of their religion. The hierarchic organization of the
          Roman Catholic Church naturally began soon after the Spanish
          conquest, but did not receive its present form until 1865. The
          archbishop of Buenos Ayres, which was an episcopal see as early
          as 1582, has the capital under his control, which contains
          nearly 800,000 inhabitants. The suffragan bishopric are those of
          Paraguay (founded 1547), Cordoba (1570), Salta (1806), San Juan
          de Cuyo (1834), Parang (1859), La Plata (1897), Santa Fé (1897),
          and Tucuman (1897). Cordoba, the first city of the country to
          have a cathedral, is also the richest in religious buildings.

          In 1884 a Vicar-Apostolic of Carmen de Patagones was appointed
          with jurisdiction over southern Argentina and northern
          Patagonia. He draws his priests from the Salesians, as does also
          the apostolic prefecture for southern Patagonia, erected in
          1883. Throughout Patagonia an active missionary propaganda is
          carried on among the aborigines, of whom some 30,000 are
          estimated to be unbaptized.

          Although almost half the inhabitants of Argentina are either
          immigrants or the children of immigrants, and come from the most
          varied countries of Europe, the great majority of these
          newcomers belong to the Roman Catholic Church, on account of the
          predominance of Italians (about 500,000), Spaniards (about
          200,000), and Roman Catholic Swiss. For decades the latter have
          flocked in great numbers to northern Argentina. The relatively
          small number of Protestants in the republic is estimated at
          about 33,000. Of these between 23,000 and 24,000 belong to the
          German Synod of La Plata, which also includes the Evangelicals
          of Paraguay and Uruguay. To them must be added a group of
          congregations of the Swiss Reformed, the Anglican Church (with a
          number of places of worship in Buenos Ayres), and North American
          Presbyterians, who are most numerous in the capital, as well as
          in Rosario and Bahia Blanca.

          Education is under the control of the State by a law of 1868,
          and the number of public schools, which has steadily increased,
          is now 3,400, in addition to parochial schools. The high schools
          consist of sixteen "lyceums," and there are likewise two
          universities, of which that at Cordoba is the more
          distinguished.

          Arianism is a heresy, named from its most Prominent
          representative, Arius, a presbyter of Alexandria (d. 336; see
          [553]Arius). It denied that the Son was of the same substance
          (Gk. homoousios) with the Father and reduced him to the rank of
          a creature, though preexistent before the world. No
          Christological heresy of ancient Christianity was more widely
          accepted or tenacious. During a part of the fourth century it
          was the ruling creed in the Eastern Church, though there were
          constant and vigorous protests by the orthodox party. It was
          also the form of Christianity to which most of the barbarian
          Teutonic races were at first converted.

  I. History:

    1. Origin of the Heresy.

          The roots of the Arian conflict lie deep in the differences of
          the ante-Nicene doctrine of the Logos, especially in the
          contradictory elements of Origen's Christology, which was
          claimed by both parties. Origen attributed to Christ eternity
          and other divine attributes, which lead to the Nicene doctrine
          of the identity of substance, but, on the other hand, in his
          zeal for the personal distinctions in the Godhead, he taught
          with equal emphasis a separate essence and the subordination of
          the Son to the Father, calling him "a secondary God," while the
          Father is "the God"; the Logos was a creature and occupies a
          position between the nature of the unbegotten (Gk. agennetos)
          God and the nature of all begotten things (Contra Celsum, iii.
          34). He taught the eternal generation of the Son from the will
          of the Father, but represented it as the communication of a
          secondary divine substance. In the East these different
          representations were discussed and found advocates, and a synod
          at Antioch (268) rejected the doctrine of identity of substance.
          Through the Antiochian School the doctrine of the subordination
          of the Son was worked out. Lucian, the teacher of Arius (see
          [554]LUCIAN THE MARTYR). and of Eusebius of Nicomedia, exercised
          a controlling influence on the views of Arius; Harnack (History
          of Dogma, iv. 3) calls him "the Arius before Arius." The first
          opponent of Arius was Alexander, bishop of Alexandria, and the
          greatest doctrinal opponent of the Arian Christology was
          Athanasius.

    1. From 318 to the Council of Niceæa, 325:

    2. Outbreak of the Controversy.

          The origin of the controversy is involved in some obscurity, and
          the accounts are not easy to reconcile. The earliest date for
          the clash of views is 318. The Christological question had
          become a burning one in Egypt. Alexander both in church and
          presbyterial gatherings had taken it up and refuted false views,
          as Arius afterward reminded him (Epiphanius, Epist. Arii ad
          Alex.). According to Socrates (i. 5), Alexander gave the first
          impulse to the controversy by insisting, in a meeting of
          presbyters and other clergy, on the eternity of the Son;
          whereupon Arius openly opposed, and charged him with
          Sabellianism. He reasoned thus: "If the Father begat the Son, he
          must be older than the Son, and there was a time when the Son
          was not; from this it further follows that the Son has his
          subsistence (Gk. hypostosis) from nothing." The accounts of
          Sozomen (i. 15) and Epiphanius differ in dating the conflict
          from discussions among the presbyters and laymen, and Sozomen
          represents Alexander as at first taking no decided position
          between the two opinions. In 320 or 321 Alexander convened a
          synod of about a hundred Egyptian and Lybian bishops at
          Alexandria, which excommunicated Arias and his followers. Arias
          found powerful friends in Eusebius of Nicomedia, Eusebius of
          Cæsarea, Paulinus of Tyre, Gregory of Berytus, Aetius of Lydda,
          and other bishops who either shared his view, or at least
          considered it innocent. He took refuge with Eusebius at
          Nicomedia, which had been the imperial residence since
          Diocletian, and spread his views in a half-poetic work, Thalia
          ("The Banquet"), of which Athanasius has preserved fragments.
          Alexander defended himself and warned against Arias in a letter
          which he sent to many bishops (Epiphanius, lxix. 4, says 70;
          Socrates gives the letter, i. 6). Arias made appeal to Eusebius
          of Cæsarea and others to secure his reinstatement as presbyter,
          and a Palestinian synod went so far as to authorize him to labor
          in Alexandria, subject to the authority of the bishop,
          Alexander. In a short time the whole Eastern Church became a
          metaphysical battle-field. The attention of the Emperor
          Constantine was called to the controversy, and in a letter to
          Alexander and Arius he pronounced it a mere logomachy, a wrangle
          over things incomprehensible; he also sent Hosius of Cordova to
          Egypt to mediate between the contending parties (Socrates, i. 7,
          gives the letter, as does also Eusebius, Vita Const., ii.). From
          political considerations, however, at the suggestion of certain
          bishops, he called the first ecumenical council of the Church,
          to settle the Arian controversy together with the question of
          the time of celebrating Easter and the Meletian schism in Egypt.

    2. The Council of Nicæa, 325:

    3. The Nicene Creed.

          The council met at Nicæa in Bithynia. It consisted of three
          hundred and eighteen bishops (about one-sixth of all the bishops
          of the Greco-Roman Empire), resulted in the formal condemnation
          of Arius, and the adoption of the "Nicene Creed," which affirms
          in unequivocal terms the doctrine of the eternal deity of Christ
          in these words: "[We believe] in one Lord Jesus Christ, the only
          Son of God, begotten of the Father, Light of Light, very God of
          very God, begotten, not made, being of one substance with the
          Father, by whom all things were made; who for us men, and for
          our salvation, came down and was incarnate, and was made man; he
          suffered, and the third day he rose again, and ascended into
          heaven; from thence he cometh to judge the quick and the dead."
          To the original Nicene Creed is added the following anathema:
          "And those who say there was a time when he [the Son] was not;
          and he was made out of nothing, or out of another substance or
          thing, or the Son of God is created, or changeable, or
          alterable;--they are condemned by the holy catholic and
          apostolic Church." This anathema. was omitted in that form of
          the Nicene Creed which is usually, though incorrectly, traced to
          the Constantinopolitan Synod of 381, and which after the Council
          of Chalcedon, in 451, entirely superseded the Nicene Creed of
          325, in its primitive form. (See below, § 8.)

          It is possible that Alexander and Hosius had come to an
          understanding, before the council met, concerning the use of the
          term homoousíos (Socrates, i. 7, says they discussed the ousia
          and hypostasis); Harnack positively takes this position, Loofs
          hesitates. The creed was signed by nearly all the bishops,
          Hosius at the head, even by Eusebius of Cæsarea, who, before and
          afterward, occupied a middle position between Athanasius and
          Arius. This is the first instance of such signing of a doctrinal
          symbol. Eusebius of Nicomedia and Theognis of Nicæa; a signed
          the creed, but not the condemnatory formula appended, and for
          this they were deposed, and banished for a short time. Two
          Egyptian bishops--Theonas and Secundus--persistently refused to
          sign, and were banished, with Arius, to Illyria. This is the
          first example of the civil punishment of heresy, and opened the
          long and dark era of persecution for all departures from the
          catholic or orthodox faith. The books of Arius were burnt, and
          his followers branded as enemies of Christianity. The Nicene
          Creed has outlived all the subsequent storms, and, in the
          improved form recognized at Constantinople in 381, it remains to
          this day the most generally received creed of Christendom; and,
          if the later Latin insertion, the filioque, be omitted, a bond
          of union between the Greek, the Roman, and the orthodox
          Protestant Churches.

    3. From the Council of Nicæa, 325, to the Council of Constantinople, 381:

    5. Arian Reaction. Athanasius.

          Not long after the Nicene Council an Arian and semi-Arian
          reaction took place, and acquired for a time the ascendency in
          the empire. Arianism now entered the stage of its political
          power. This was a period of the greatest excitement in Church
          and State: Council was held against council; creed was set up
          against creed; anathema was hurled against anathema. "The
          highways," says the impartial heathen historian, Ammianus
          Marcellinus, "were covered with galloping bishops." The
          churches, the theaters, the hippodromes, the feasts, the
          markets, the streets, the baths, and the and the baths, and the
          shops at Constantinople and other large cities were filled with
          dogmatic disputes. In intolerance and violence the Arians even
          exceeded the orthodox. The interference of emperors and their
          courts only poured oil on the flames, and heightened the
          bitterness of contest by adding confiscation and exile to the
          spiritual punishment of synodical excommunication. The
          unflinching leader of the orthodox party was [555]Athanasius, a
          pure and sublime character, who had figured at the Council of
          Nicæa as a youthful archdeacon, in company with Alexander, whom
          he succeeded as bishop (326); but he was again and again deposed
          by imperial despotism, and spent twenty years in exile. He
          sacrificed everything to his conviction, and had the courage to
          face the empire in arms (hence the motto: Athanasius contra
          mundum). He was a man of one idea and one passion, the eternal
          divinity of Christ,--which he considered the corner-stone of the
          Christian system. The politico-ecclesiastical leader of the
          Arian party was Eusebius of Nicomedia who, probably owing to the
          influence of the Emperor Constantine (Socrates, i. 25 etc.), was
          recalled from exile and baptized Constantine on his death-bed.
          Constantine was turned favorably to Arius, accepted a confession
          he prepared, recalled him from exile, and ordered him to be
          solemnly restored to the communion of the catholic Church at
          Constantinople; he even demanded his restoration in Alexandria
          by Athanasius; but, on the day preceding his intended
          restoration, the heretic suddenly died (336). In the year
          following, Constantine himself died, and his son Constantine II.
          recalled Athanasius from his first exile. In the West the Nicene
          statement found universal acceptance. But in the East, where
          Constantius, the second son of Constantine the Great, ruled,
          opposition to the Nicene formula was well-nigh universal, and
          was maintained with fanatical zeal by the court and by Eusebius
          of Nicomedia, who was transferred to Constantinople in 338.
          Athanasius was attacked on personal charges with great vehemence
          by the Eusebians who sought to supersede the doctrine of the
          homoousia by indirect methods. He was banished to Gaul in 335.
          Eustathius of Antioch, a supporter of Athanasius, had been
          deposed at a synod at Antioch in 330 (Socrates, i. 23), the
          charge being that he advocated Sabellianism. Marcellus of
          Ancyra, another vigorous defender of the Nicene symbol, was also
          deposed at a synod in Constantinople. Arius's death occurred a
          little later, but the work of punishing his opponents went on.
          Athanasius was deposed a second time (339), and took refuge with
          Julius of Rome, who, with the great body of the Western Church,
          believed him a martyr.

    6. Various Synods and Parties.

          It is unnecessary to follow the varying fortunes of the two
          parties, and the history of councils, which neutralized one
          another, without materially advancing the points in dispute. The
          most important are the [556]synod of Antioch, 341), which set
          forth an orthodox creed, but deposed Athanasius; the orthodox
          synod of Sardica, which declared Athanasius and Marcellus
          orthodox, and the Arias counter-synod of Philippopolis, 343; the
          synods of Sirmium, 351, which protested against Athanasius's
          reinstatement at Alexandria; Arles, 353; Milan, 355, which
          condemned Athanasius in obedience to Constantine; the second
          synod at Sirmium, 357; the third, 358; at Antioch, 358; at
          Ancyra, 358; at Constantinople, 360; at Alexandria, 362. Aided
          by Constantius, Arianism, under the modified form represented by
          the term homoiousios ("similar in essence," as distinct from the
          Nicene homoousios and the strictly Arian heteroousios), gained
          the power in the empire; and even the papal chair in Rome was
          for a while desecrated by heresy during the Arian interregnum of
          Felix Il. But the death of Constantius in 361, the indifference
          of his successor, the Emperor Julian, to all theological
          disputes (the exiled bishops were at liberty to return to their
          sees, though he afterward banished Athanasius), the toleration
          of Jovian (d. 364), and especially the internal dissensions of
          the Arians, prepared the way for a new triumph of orthodoxy. The
          Eusebians, or semi-Arians, taught that the Son was similar in
          substance (homoiousios) to the Father; while the Aetians (from
          Aetius, a deacon of Antioch who revived Arianism) and the
          Eunomians (from Eunomius, Bishop of Cyzicus in Mysia) taught
          that he was of a different substance (heteroousios), and unlike
          (anomoios) the Father in everything as also in substance (hence
          the names Heteroousiasts and Anomoians or Anomoeans). A number
          of compromising synods and creeds undertook to heal these
          dissensions, but without permanent effect.

    7. Vindication of Orthodoxy.

          On the other hand, the defenders of the Nicene Creed,
          Athanasius, and, after his death in 373, the three Cappadocian
          bishops,--Basil the Great, Gregory of Nazianzus, and Gregory of
          Nyssa,--triumphantly vindicated the catholic doctrine against
          all the arguments of the opposition. The Cappadocians made the
          homoousios the starting-point of their discussions, as is
          apparent from the correspondence of Basil with Apollinaris.
          Damasus, the Roman bishop, true to the general policy of his
          predecessors and of Julius in particular, had Arianism condemned
          at two Roman synods, 369, 377. When Gregory of Naziansus was
          called to Constantinople in 379, there was but one small
          congregation in the city which had not become Arian; but his
          able and eloquent sermons on the deity of Christ, which won him
          the title of "the Theologian," contributed powerfully to the
          resurrection of the catholic faith. The using influence of
          monasticism, especially in Egypt and Syria, was bound up with
          the cause of Athanasius and the Cappadocians; and the more
          conservative portion of the semi-Arians gradually approached the
          orthodox in spite of the persecutions of the violent Arias
          emperor, Valens.

    4. The Final Triumph of the Nicene Orthodoxy under Theodosius the Great,
    381:

    8. The Council of Constantinople, 381.

          Theodosius was a Spaniard by birth, and reared in the Nicene
          faith. On entering Constantinople he removed the Arians from the
          charge of the churches and substituted the orthodox party.
          During his reign (379-395) he completed externally the spiritual
          and intellectual victory of orthodoxy already achieved. He
          convened the second ecumenical council at Constantinople, 381,
          which consisted of only one hundred and fifty bishops, and was
          presided over successively by Meletius, Gregory of Nazianzus,
          and Nectarius of Constantinople. The council condemned the
          Pneumatomachian heresy (which denied the divinity of the Holy
          Spirit), the Sabellians, Eunomians, Apollinarians, etc., and
          virtually completed the orthodox dogma of the Holy Trinity. The
          Nicene Creed now in common use (with the exception of the Latin
          clause filioque, which is of much later date and rejected by the
          Greek Church) can not be traced to this synod of Constantinople,
          but existed at an earlier date; it is found in the Ancoratus of
          Epiphanius (373), and derived by him from a still older source,
          namely, the baptismal creed of the Church of Jerusalem. It is
          not in the original acts of the Council of Constantinople, but
          was afterward incorporated in them and may have been approved by
          the Council. Dr. Hort derives it mainly from Cyril of Jerusalem,
          about 362-364 (cf. his Dissertations and see the article
          [557]Constantinopolitan Creed). The emperor gave legal effect to
          the doctrinal decisions and disciplinary canons, and in July,
          381, he enacted a law that all church property should be given
          up to those who believed in the equal divinity of the Father,
          the Son, and the Holy Spirit. Bishops like Ambrose of Milan
          supported the emperor and did much to bring the Nicene doctrine
          into complete acceptance.

    9. The Latter Arianism.

          After Theodosius, Arianism ceased to exist as an organised
          moving force in theology and church history; but it reappeared
          from time to time as an isolated theological opinion, especially
          in England. Emlyn, Whiston, Whitby, Samuel Clarke, Lardner, and
          many who are ranked among Socinians and Unitarians, held Arian
          sentiments; but Milton and Isaac Newton, though approaching the
          Arian view on the relation of the Son to the Father, differed
          widely from Arianism in spirit and aim.

    5. Arianism among the Barbarians:

          The church legislation of Theodosius was confined, of course, to
          the limits of the Roman Empire. Beyond it, among the barbarians
          of the West, who had received Christianity in the form of
          Arianism during the reign of the Emperor Valens, it maintained
          itself for two centuries longer, though more as a matter of
          accident than choice and conviction. The Ostrogoths remained
          Arians till 553; the Visigoths, till the Synod of Toledo in 589;
          the Suevi in Spain, till 560; the Vandals, who conquered North
          Africa in 429, and furiously persecuted the catholics, till 530,
          when they were expelled by Belisarius; the Burgundians, till
          their incorporation in the Frank Empire in 534; the Lombards in
          Italy, till the middle of the seventh century. Alaric, the first
          conqueror of Rome, Genseric, the conqueror of North Africa,
          Theodoric the Great, King of Italy, were Arians; and the first
          Teutonic translation of the Scriptures of which important
          fragments remain came from the Arian or semi-Arian missionary
          Ulfilas.

  II. The Creed of Arianism:

    1. The Arian Teaching.

          The Father alone is God; he alone is unbegotten, eternal, wise,
          good, unchangeable. He is separated by an infinite chasm from
          man. God can not communicate his essence. The Son of God is
          preexistent, "before time and before the world," and "before all
          creatures." He is a middle being between God and the world, the
          perfect image of the Father, the executor of his thoughts, yea,
          even the Creator of the world. In a secondary or metaphorical
          sense he may be called "God." But, on the other hand, Christ is
          himself a "creature,"--the first creature of God, through whom
          the Father called other creatures into existence. He is "made,"
          not of "the essence" of the Father, but "out of nothing," by
          "the will" of the Father, before all conceivable time, yet in
          time. He is not eternal, and there "was a time when he was not."
          Neither was he unchangeable by creation, but subject to the
          vicissitudes of a created being. By following the good
          uninterruptedly, he became unchangeable. With the limitation of
          Christ's duration is necessarily connected a limitation of his
          power, wisdom, and knowledge. It was expressly asserted by the
          Arians that the Son does not perfectly know the Father, and
          therefore can not perfectly reveal him. He is essentially
          different from the Father (heteroousios, in opposition to the
          orthodox formula, homoousios, "coequal," and the semi-Arian
          homoioueios, ("similar in essence"). Aetius and Eunomius
          afterward, more strongly expressed this by calling him unlike
          the Father (anomoios). As to the humanity of Christ, Arius
          ascribed to him only a human body with an animal soul, not a
          rational soul. He anticipated [558]Apollinaris of Laodicea, who
          substituted the divine Logos for the human reason, but from the
          opposite motive,--to save the unity of the divine personality of
          Christ.

          The subsequent development of Arianism by Aetius and Eunomius
          brought out no new features, except many inconsistencies and
          contradictions. The controversy degenerated into a heartless and
          barren metaphysical war. The eighteen or more creeds which
          Arianism and semi-Arianism produced between the first and the
          second ecumenical councils (325-381) are leaves without
          blossoms, and branches without fruit.

    . Arguments of the Arians.

          The Arians supported their doctrine from those passages of the
          Bible which seem to place Christ on a par with the creature
          (Prov. viii. 22-25; Acts ii. 36; Col. i. 15), or which ascribe
          to the incarnate Christ (not the preexistent Logos) in his state
          of humiliation lack of the knowledge, weariness, sorrow, and
          other changing affections and states of mind (Luke ii. 52; Mark
          xiii. 32; Heb. v. 8, 9; John xii. 27, 28; Matt. xxvi. 39), or
          which teach some kind of subordination of the Son to the Father
          (especially John xiv. 28: "The Father is greater than I," which
          refers, not to the essential nature, but to the state of
          humiliation). Arius was forced to admit, in his first letter to
          Eusebius of Nicomedia, that Christ was called God (even "the
          full, only-begotten God," according to the famous disputed
          reading for "only-begotten Son," in John i. 18. Cf. Hort's first
          dissertation). But he reduced this expression to the idea of a
          subordinate, secondary, created divinity. The dogmatic and
          philosophical arguments were chiefly negative and rationalistic,
          amounting to this: The Nicene view of the essential deity of
          Christ is unreasonable, inconsistent with monotheism, with the
          dignity and absoluteness of the Father, and of necessity leads
          to Sabellianism, or the Gnostic dreams of emanation.

    3. Refutation of Arianism.

          On the other hand, Arianism was refuted by Scriptural passages,
          which teach directly or indirectly the divinity of Christ, and
          his essential equality with the Father. The conception of a
          created Creator, who existed before the world, and yet himself
          began to exist, was shown to be self-contradictory and
          untenable. There can be no middle being between Creator and
          creature; no time before the world, as time is itself a part of
          the world, or the form under which it exists successively; nor
          can the unchangeableness of the Father, on which Arius laid
          great stress, be maintained, except on the ground of the
          eternity of his Fatherhood, which, of course, implies the
          eternity of the Sonship. Athanasius charges Arianism with
          dualism, and even polytheism, and with destroying the whole
          doctrine of salvation. For if the Son is a creature, man still
          remains separated, as before, from God: no creature can redeem
          other creatures, and unite them with God. If Christ is not
          divine, much less can we be partakers of the divine nature, and
          in any real sense children of God.

   Arias, Benedictus
          ARIAS, ??´´ri´?s, BENEDICTUS (Called Montanus): Spanish scholar;
          b. probably at Fregenal de la Sierra (215 m. s. w. of Madrid),
          Estremadura, Spain, Nov. 12, 1527; d. at Seville July 6, 1598.
          He studied in Seville and Alcala and became especially
          proficient in languages; became a priest of the knightly order
          of St. Iago and accompanied Bishop Martin Perez Ajala of Segovia
          to the Council of Trent. King Philip II. called him from a life
          of scholastic retirement at Aracena near Seville and sent him to
          Belgium in 1568 to superintend the preparation of the Antwerp
          Polyglot (see [559]Bibles, Polyglot, II.), and when the work was
          completed (1572) he went to Rome to present it to the pope. On
          his return to Spain the king rewarded him with a pension and
          several remunerative appointments, such as court chaplain and
          librarian at the Escorial. He was blamed for preferring the
          Hebrew text to the Vulgate and for introducing the Targums into
          the Polyglot. The Jesuits, to whom he was opposed, were
          particularly active with charges against him, but he succeeded
          in clearing himself at Rome. Besides the Apparatus to the
          Antwerp Polyglot (containing dissertations De Hebraicis
          idiotismis, De arcano sermone, etc.), he wrote commentaries on
          many of the books of the Bible, Antiquitatum Judaicarum libri
          ix. (Leyden, 1593), Liber generationis et regenerationis Adam
          (Antwerp, 1593), translated into Latin Benjamin of Tudela's
          travels (1575), and wrote Latin poems.

   Aribo
          ARIBO, ??´´rî´bO: Bishop of Freising 764-784. If, as is
          probable, he is the boy whose story he tells in the Vita
          Corbiniani, xxxiv., he was born at Mais near Meran, and educated
          by Bishop Erembert of Freising. His signature appears first as
          witness to a document of 748. Under Bishop Joseph he was
          ordained and filled the office of notary, soon afterward of
          archpriest, and later of abbot of Scharnitz. After Joseph's
          death (Jan. 17, 764), he was raised to the bishopric of
          Freising, whose possessions he increased considerably. The
          opposition of Tassilo, duke of Bavaria, to Frankish rule made
          trouble for him; he took the Frankish side, and appears to have
          been deprived of his bishopric by Tassilo, since in 782 Abbot
          Atto of Schledorf was in charge of the diocese, while Aribo did
          not die until May 4, 784. He wrote two biographies, one of St.
          Corbinian, whose relics he translated to Freising, probably in
          768 (not fully completed; afterward retouched by the monk
          Hrotroc), and one of Emmeram, abbot and bishop of Regensburg.
          The former in its original form, ed. S. Riezler, was published
          at Munich in 1888; as completed, in C. Meichelbeck, Historia
          Frisingensis, i. (Augsburg, 1724), and in ASB, Sept., iii.

   Aristeas
          ARISTEAS, ar´´is-tî´?s: The name assumed by the author of a
          letter professing to give the history of the translation into
          Greek of the Hebrew Pentateuch for Ptolemy II. Philadelphus. The
          letter stated that, at the suggestion of Demetrius Phalereus,
          Ptolemy sent Aristeas to the high priest Eleazar to obtain
          experienced men to render the Hebrew Law into Greek for the
          library at Alexandria. Eleazar chose seventy-two men, six from
          each of the tribes, who went to Egypt, were received with great
          honor, completed their task, and were sent back with presents
          for themselves and the high priest. There is a legend that five
          were Samaritans and that their copies were preserved.

          This narrative was for centuries the account accepted by Jews
          and Christians of the origin of the Septuagint. It appears in
          Aristobulus (as quoted by Eusebius, Præparatio evangelica, xiii.
          12), Philo (Vita Mosis, ii.), Josephus (Ant., XII. ii. 2 sqq.),
          Justin Martyr, Irenæus, Clement of Alexandria, Tertullian, and
          so on down to Whiston. The letter has been shown to be
          unhistorical, e.g., Demetrius Phalereus was banished from
          Alexandria at the beginning of the reign of Ptolemy
          Philadelphus. Its purpose was the glorification of the Hebrew
          race, religion, and literature. Its statements are entirely
          discredited by modern criticism, and its author is entirely
          unknown.

          Bibliography: The letter was printed with a number of editions
          of the Bible, e.g., that of J. Andreas, 1471; was translated
          into English by J. Done, London, 1633, was edited in Greek with
          English translation, London, 1715; it in appended to Swete's
          Introduction to the Septuagint, London, 1902; and was translated
          with notes by H. St. J. Thackeray, London, 1904. H. Hody wrote
          in 1685, Contra Historiam Aristeæ de LXX Interpretibus
          Dissertatio, and followed it in 1705 with his great De bibliorum
          textibus originalibus, which completely demolished the letter as
          a foundation for history. C. Hayes vainly attempted a defense in
          1736. Consult also: E. Nestle, Septuagintastudien, vol. ii.,

   Aristides, Marcianus
          ARISTIDES, ar´´is-t?i´dîz, MARCIANUS: An Athenian philosopher,
          who, according to Eusebius (Hist. eccl., iv. 3), wrote a popular
          Christian apology. Little was known of the work till 1891, when
          Harris and Robinson published a complete Syriac version and
          proved at the same time that the greater part of the apology is
          contained in the legend of [560]Barlaam and Josaphat, extant in
          many Greek manuscripts and numerous translations. Since that
          time much attention has been paid to the work. It is addressed
          to Antoninus Pius and has points of contact with the Kerygma of
          Peter, the Shepherd of Hermas, the Didache, and Justin, but more
          especially with the letter to Diognetus. After speaking of the
          true idea of God (chap. i.), it takes up the origin of the
          nations which followed error and those which followed the truth.
          The barbarians are treated in chapters iii.-vii., the errors of
          the Hellenes in viii.-xiii. with an excursus on the Egyptians
          (xii.), chapter xiv. is devoted to the Jews, and xv.-xvii. speak
          of the Christians, especially of their life and customs, in an
          attractive and instructive manner. Through the apology the name
          Aristides obtained a certain literary popularity among the
          Armenians. A homily "On the Call of the Thief and the Answer of
          the Crucified" (Luke xxiii. 42-43) and a fragment of a letter
          "To All Philosophers" are ascribed to him. Other names from old
          Christian literature besides that of Aristides were applied to
          literary frauds in Armenia from the fifth to the seventh century
          (cf. F. C. Conybeare, in The Guardian, July 18, 1894).

   Aristo of Pella
          ARISTO OF PELLA: Reputed author of a "Dialogue between Jason and
          Papiscus concerning Christ." The work was known to Celsus, and
          Origen (Contra Celaum, iv. 52) defends it against his
          contemptuous opinion without naming the author. Maximus
          Confessor in his scholia to the "Mystic Theology" of Dionysius
          the Areopagite (chap. i., p. 17, ed. Corderius) ascribes it to
          Aristo of Pella, and Eusebius (Hist. eccl., iv. 6) quotes from
          Aristo (without naming the work) concerning the war of
          Bar-Kokba. Citations in Jerome show that the author used the
          Bible-version of Aquila. A letter, wrongly attributed to Cyprian
          (Opera, iii. 119-120, ed. Hartel), states that a certain Celsus
          made a Latin translation of the Dialogue, probably in the fifth
          century, and tells that Jason was a Jewish Christian and
          Papiscus an Alexandrian Jew and that the former converted the
          latter. The work was probably written between 140 and 170 and
          was used by Tertullian and Cyprian, and made the basis of other
          works of a similar character.

   Aristobulus
          ARISTOBULUS, ar´´is-to-biu´lus: 1. The name of several notable
          persons in the last period of Jewish history, belonging to the
          Hasmonean and Herodian families. See [561]Hasmoneans; [562]Herod
          and His Family.

          2. A Jewish Alexandrian writer of the time of Ptolemy VI.
          Philometor, according to Clement of Alexandria (Stromata, II.
          xv. 72; xxii. 50; V. xiv. 97; VI. iii. 32), Origen (Contra
          Celsum, iv. 17), Anatolius (in Eusebius, Hist. eccl., vii. 32),
          and Eusebius (Præp. evan., vii. 14; viii. 10; xiii. 12; Chron.,
          ed. Schoene, ii. 124-125). In II Macc. i. 10 an Aristobulus is
          mentioned as teacher of one of the Ptolemies and the most
          influential member of the Jewish Alexandrian diaspora, and a
          letter is addressed to him written under Philometor. Clement and
          Eusebius identify the author quoted by them with the one
          mentioned here. Accordingly Aristobulus flourished about 170-150
          B.C. Clement (V. xiv. 97) states that he wrote "abundant books
          to show that the peripatetic philosophy was derived from the law
          of Moses and from the other prophets," and Eusebius (Chron.)
          that he wrote expositions of the writings of Moses, which he
          dedicated to Philometor. Fragments are found in Eusebius (Præp.,
          viii. 10 and xiii.12; cf. Hist. eccl., VII. xxxii.16-19). They
          express two of the fundamental thoughts of the Alexandrian
          Jewish apologists,--that the heathen writers derived their
          wisdom from the writings of Moses, and that the anthropomorphism
          of the Old Testament must not be taken literally. It is
          questionable, however, whether this Aristobulus is a historical
          person. Hody, Willrich, and others have brought forward weighty
          reasons for thinking him a Jewish fiction. Whether the
          instructor of Philometor was first invented and afterward the
          apologist or vice versa must be left undecided.

   Aristotle
          ARISTOTLE, ar´is-t?t-l: Greek philosopher; b. at Stagira, in
          Thrace, 384 B.C.; d. at Chalcis, on the island of Euboea, 322
          B.C. At the age of seventeen he became a scholar of Plato in
          Athens and remained with him twenty years; after Plato's death
          (347 B.C.) he went to the court of Hermias, at Atarneus in
          Mysia; in 343 B.C. he was summoned by King Philip of Macedon to
          become teacher of his son Alexander. After the latter became
          king, Aristotle opened a school in Athens (probably in 334 B.C.)
          near the temple of Apollo Lykeios (whence it was called the
          Lyceum, while from his habit of giving instruction while walking
          back and forth the school has been called peripatetic, from Gk.
          peripateo). After Alexander's death the anti-Macedonian party in
          Athena forced him to retire to Chalcis.

          The philosophy of Aristotle is a strongly pronounced dualism;
          matter and form, God and the world, are distinct though
          inseparable existences. The harmony of this duality is an
          equally pronounced pantheism; God is an act rather than a will,
          a process and not a person. But the dualism of Aristotle is not
          materialistic; the form, God, is the principal constituent, and
          his pantheism is absolutely monotheistic, directly opposed to
          every form of polytheism. Therefore it may be inferred that he
          would win sympathy in the Christian Church; and while some of
          the Fathers attack him vehemently (as Irenæus) and others (as
          Justin Martyr) pass him by in silence, there are those among
          them (as Clement of Alexandria) who consider him a precursor of
          Christ, holding the truth in so far as it could be held before
          Christ came. Then, when the dialectical elaboration of the
          Christian dogmas began, his great labors on logic were by no
          means neglected. The heretics used them in the fourth and fifth
          centuries, and the catholics followed the example in the sixth
          and seventh.

          In the Latin Church Aristotle was introduced by Boëthius and
          Cassiodorus. His study received a powerful impulse from the
          Jewish and Arabic doctors, who translated his works into Syriac
          and Arabic; and the anxiety which the Roman Church felt with
          respect to his metaphysical works, and which led to their
          condemnation and exclusion from the universities, disappeared
          after the time of Albertus Magnus and Thomas Aquinas. The
          Renaissance, which brought the works of Aristotle to the West in
          the original Greek text, developed an Aristotelian and a
          Platonic school; but when the Renaissance grew into the
          Reformation, and the splendid edifice which had been built up on
          Plato and Aristotle--the medieval scholasticism tumbled down,
          Aristotle lost at once his influence on Christian theology (see
          [563]Scholasticism; also [564]Albertus Magnus; [565]Thomas
          Aquinas). At present, however, he is an increasing force in
          theology. His "Metaphysics" is the inspiration of all who seek
          for the ultimate meaning of reality--matter, form, efficient
          cause, final cause or end, and God. His "Ethics" and "Politics'
          remain the most original and stimulating source for the study of
          those personal and social virtues which Christianity has to
          train. His principle of attention to the individual and the
          concrete, his minute and unwearied investigation of phenomena,
          his analytic insight to which these disclose their secret,
          profoundly affect the spirit and method of ethical and religious
          thinkers who study his works.

   Arius
          ARIUS, ?-r?i´us or ê´ri-us: One of the most famous of heretics;
          b. in Libya (according to others, in Alexandria) about 256; d.
          at Constantinople 336. He was educated by Lucian, presbyter in
          Antioch (see [566]Lucian the Martyr), and became presbyter in
          Alexandria. The bishop of that city, Alexander, took exception
          to his views concerning the eternal deity of Christ and his
          equality with the Father and thus, about 318, began the great
          controversy which bears the name of Arius. He is described as a
          tall, lean man, with a downcast brow, austere habits,
          considerable learning, and a smooth, winning address, but
          quarrelsome disposition. The silence of his enemies conclusively
          proves that his general moral character was irreproachable. His
          opponents said that he cherished a personal grudge against
          Alexander, because he was not himself elected bishop; but the
          subordination views which he had imbibed in the Antiochian
          school are sufficient to explain the direction of his
          development and the course of his life. Condemned by a synod at
          Alexandria in 320 or 321, he left the city, but was kindly
          received both by Eusebius of Cæsarea and Eusebius of Nicomedia,
          and it was evident that not a few of the Asiatic churches
          favored his ideas. A reconciliation was brought about between
          him and Alexander; but hardly had he returned to Alexandria
          before the strife broke out again, and with still greater
          violence. In spite of his many and powerful friends, Arius was
          defeated at the Council of Nicæa (325), and banished to Illyria.
          Soon, however, a reaction in his favor set in. The Eusebian
          party espoused his cause more openly, and through Constantia,
          the sister of the emperor, he got access to the court. He was
          formally recalled from banishment; and all the chiefs of the
          Eusebians were assembled in Constantinople to receive him back
          into the bosom of the Church, when he suddenly died the day
          before the solemnity at the age of over eighty years, at a time
          and in a manner that seemed to the orthodox to be a direct
          interposition of Providence, and a condemnation of his doctrine;
          while his friends attributed his death to poison. Athanasius
          relates the fact in a letter to Serapion (De morte Arii) on the
          authority of a priest, Macarius of Constantinople. Epiphanius
          (Hær., lxviii. 7) compares his death to that of Judas the
          traitor. Socrates (Hist. eccl., i. 38) and Sozomen (Hist. eccl.,
          ii. 30) give minute accounts with disgusting details. Arius's
          principal work, called Thalia ("the Banquet"), which he wrote
          during his stay with Eusebius at Nicomedia, was a defense of his
          doctrine in an entertaining popular form, half poetry, half
          prose; with the exception of a few fragments in the tracts of
          Athanasius, it is lost. A letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia, and
          one to Alexander of Alexandria, are extant (cf.
          Fabricius-Harles, viii., Hamburg, 1802, p. 309). It should be
          borne in mind that all knowledge of Arius is derived from the
          accounts of his enemies and opponents, written during the course
          of an exceedingly bitter controversy. See [567]Arianism;
          [568]Athanasius; and consult the works there mentioned.

                                    The Second Period (§ 8).

  1. Description.

          According to the Pentateuchal narrative, the ark of the covenant
          was the receptacle of the tables of the law (called "tables of
          the covenant," Deut. ix. 9, 11, 15; "tables of the testimony,"
          Ex. xxxi. 18, xxxii. 15, xxxiv. 29), attesting the divine will,
          the foundation of the community between God and Israel. It is so
          called in Num. x. 33, xiv. 44; Deut. x. 8. (cf. Heb. ix. 4); in
          Ex. xxv. 22, xxvi. 33-34 "ark of the testimony" is found.
          According to the description of Ex. xxv. 10-22, xxvi. 33-34,
          xxxvii. 1-9, xl. 20-21, it was a chest of shittim (acacia) wood,
          standing on four feet, two cubits and a half (three feet nine
          inches) long, a cubit and a half (two feet three inches) wide
          and high; it was overlaid with gold inside and out, decorated
          with a golden crown (rim or molding), and had a gold ring at
          each of the four corners above the feet, through which passed
          staves overlaid with gold that the ark might be carried; these
          staves were never to be removed. The cover was a massive golden
          plate, at the end of which figures of cherubim were placed,
          facing each other and looking toward the cover, while their
          outspread wings extended over the latter. The place of the ark
          was at the rear of the Holy of Holies of the tabernacle.

  2. Meaning of Kapporeth.

          These cherubic figures direct the thought to Yahweh as enthroned
          over the ark (Ps. lxxx. 1; Jer. iii. 16-17). As it contained the
          tables of stone upon which were written the ten commandments,
          God was enthroned over that which was binding upon the people to
          which nothing could be added and from which nothing could be
          taken away. The Hebrew word kapporeth is best taken in the sense
          of "cover," not as "expiatory vessel," as is often done after
          the Septuagint, which translates it by hilasterion (Vulg.
          propitiatorium). Passages like Lev. xvi. 14-15; I Chron. xxviii.
          11, do not necessarily require the latter interpretation. For
          when on the great day of atonement, according to the first
          passage, the high priest sprinkled the blood of atonement upon
          the first part of the kapporeth, he did it because it bore the
          throne of God, to which the blood was to be brought near; and in
          the same manner the designation of the Holy of Holies as beth
          ha-kapporeth in the passage in Chronicles, can be rejected as
          unsuitable to this interpretation only by those who overlook
          that the kapporeth is not to be thought of without the cherubim
          which bear the presence of God, which presence it is which makes
          the place of the ark the Holy of Holies.

  3. Chests Used in Other Cults.

          With the chests used in the idol worship of some nations of
          antiquity, the ark of the covenant had nothing at all in common.
          For those chests contained either images of gods or a mysterious
          symbolism like the mystic chests used in the service of the
          mysteries of Dionysius, Demeter, and Venus. In the strongest
          contrast to the heathen mystery, that which the ark contained
          was known and revealed to all the world; but it was also known
          to every one that it was as holy as the Word of God, spoken to
          Israel, and the proto-document of the fundamental conditions of
          the communion-relation existing between him and his chosen
          people.

  4. Contents of the Ark.

          According to the explicit statement in I Kings viii. 9, a
          passage which precludes the idea that Solomon made any change in
          the old Mosaic sanctuary, there was nothing in the ark save the
          two tables of stone. When the author of the Epistle to the
          Hebrews (ix. 4) says that in the ark of the covenant were the
          golden pot that had manna (Ex. xvi. 33) and Aaron's rod that
          budded (Num. xvii. 10), he follows a tradition which proceeded
          from an inaccurate conception of these passages. For when Aaron
          is commanded (Ex. xvi. 33) to put the pot with manna "before
          Yahweh," and when Moses is told (Num. xvii. 10) to bring Aaron's
          rod again "before the testimony," it does not follow that these
          things were kept inside of the ark. A comparison with other
          passages where similar expressions are used does not lead to the
          inference that the pot of manna and the rod were kept in the
          Holy of Holies, but rather that they were in the sanctuary.

  5. The Second Temple.

          At the destruction of Solomon's temple the ark seems to have
          been burned; at least the second temple had an empty Holy of
          Holies. According to the Talmudic treatise Yoma (536), a stone
          three fingers above the ground was in the place of the ark, on
          which the high priest put his censer on the yearly day of
          atonement. It is this stone to which, according to some
          expositors, Zech. iii. 9 refers. The prophet Jeremiah refers to
          a time of which he says (iii. 16-17) "in those days, said the
          Lord, they shall say no more, the ark of the covenant of the
          Lord, neither shall it come to mind; neither shall they remember
          it; neither shall they visit it; neither shall that be done any
          more. At that time they shall call Jerusalem the throne of the
          Lord." This utterance reminds of the description of the new
          temple, which Ezekiel gives in the last chapters of his book
          (xl. sqq.), in which nothing is read of an ark of the covenant,
          where the living cherubim carrying the glory of God take the
          place of the cherubim of the tabernacle and of the Solomonic
          temple, made by the hand of men,--a reference to the time of the
          true dwelling of God in his congregation made perfect, in whose
          heart he wrote his law (Jer. xxxi. 33), a time when shall be
          fulfilled what the ark of the covenant of the Mosaic legislature
          together with the tabernacle prophetically prefigured as "a
          shadow of the good things to come" (Heb. x. 1).

          W. Volck.

  6. Character of the Accounts in Exodus.

          In the preprophetic age, "the ark" was the most important symbol
          of the Hebrew religion, and its functions belonged almost wholly
          to that period. The preceding sketch takes for granted that the
          descriptions of it given in Exodus correspond to its form,
          condition, and contents as it actually appeared throughout its
          many vicissitudes. But it is now generally admitted that they
          are an idealization, like the accounts in the same priestly code
          of the tabernacle itself. The tradition, however, that the ark
          was transported from Sinai to Palestine, and was moved from
          place to place till it was finally lodged in the shrine of David
          in Jerusalem and thence naturally transferred to the temple of
          Solomon, is doubtless based on fact.

  7. The First Period of the Ark's History.

          The chief significance of the ark in the history of religion is
          that it represents in unique fashion the transition stage
          between the primitive conceptions of the Deity and those
          announced by the prophets. The advance made by the Mosaic
          revelation upon the previous beliefs of the Hebrews is signally
          shown in its representation of Yahweh as more than a mere local
          deity. He was, indeed, still thought of as inseparable from his
          chosen people; but wherever they went he might go with them. He
          did not, it is true, forsake Sinai at once; in great emergencies
          he came thence in his full power and majesty to the new home of
          his worshipers (Judges v. 4 sqq., cf. I Kings xix. 8 sqq., Deut.
          xxxiii. 2). The ark, however, was to be a constant and unfailing
          proof that he was among them as their champion and protector.
          This is the original meaning of Ex. xxxiii. (cf. R. Smend,
          Alttestamentliche Religionegeschichte, Leipsic, 1893, pp.
          42-43). The question of the literal accuracy of the statement
          that the two tablets of the law were placed in the ark at Sinai
          and were thence forward kept there will be settled according to
          the view taken by each inquirer of the character of the Mosaic
          teaching. It is perhaps easier to believe that they were placed
          there at first than to suppose that they were kept there during
          the whole early history of Israel. The guardians of the ark were
          then very little concerned about the commandments of Yahweh;
          what they wanted was to have him fight their battles; they cared
          more for his numen than for his nomen. Moreover, it is not said
          whether the version of the decalogue contained in Ex. xx. (E) or
          that of xxxiv. (J) was the one that was laid in the ark. So long
          as both versions were in vogue neither could have been regarded
          as exclusively sacrosanct. Possibly some sacred stone was first
          placed in the ark as a talisman. It is noteworthy that the place
          in the Jordan where the ark stood when the waters were divided
          was marked by a heap of stones--a sacred memorial (Josh.
          iii.-iv.). The first period in the history of the ark came to an
          end with its capture by the Philistines when it was demonstrated
          that the power of Yahweh did not necessarily accompany those who
          trusted to its presence for victory (I Sam. iv.). This was
          doubtless a wholesome lesson; but the moral of it was weakened
          in later times by the sacerdotalists who added to the genuine
          tradition stories of the terrible punishments inflicted both
          upon the Philistines and Hebrews who failed, though unwittingly,
          fully to appreciate the sanctity of the ark (I Sam. v., vi.).

  8. The Second Period.

          In the next period the ark, instead of being itself an object of
          worship and an instrument of blessing or cursing, became a
          sacred relic in a permanent sanctuary. The transition stage was
          the time between its return from the Philistine country and its
          triumphal transportation to Jerusalem (I Sam. vii. 1-2; II Sam.
          vi. 1-11). The circumstances are obscure. But this much seems
          plain: That there was no fitting sanctuary for the ark now that
          Shiloh, the national religious center, had been destroyed; that
          the ark itself, having ceased to be a beneficent wonder-worker,
          was kept in seclusion; and that during the whole of the
          unsettled reigns of Saul and of David in Hebron it was never
          regarded or appealed to as a national palladium, not even in the
          most anxious days of battle. When a permanent seat of worship
          and of central government had been provided by David, it was
          natural that the most venerable monument of the national
          religion (cf. Jer. iii. 16) should be securely housed and
          guarded. But it had lost its practical efficiency. We do not
          read of its being again taken forth with the army (II Sam. xi.
          11 merely implies that it had not as yet a fitting temple of its
          own); and David himself in his utmost peril refused to have it
          carried with him when he left Jerusalem before Absalom (II Sam.
          xv. 24 sqq.). With its removal to the temple of Solomon it
          disappears from the record of Israel's religion. It was
          superseded by the living word of Revelation.

   Arkites
          ARKITES, ??rk´?itz: A people mentioned in Gen. x. 17 and I
          Chron. i. 15 as descendants of Canaan. Since Josephus (Ant., 1.
          vi. 2) the name has been connected with a town Arca (modern Arka
          and Tell Arka), at the foot of Lebanon, about 12 m. n. of
          Tripoli. It is mentioned in Assyrian inscriptions and in the
          Tell el-Amarna tablets (Schrader, 42, 55, 194), and was an
          important place in late Roman times. The emperor Alexander
          Severus was born there in a temple dedicated to Alexander the
          Great, and from this fact the town was called Cæsarea Libani. It
          was an important fortress during the crusades and a flourishing
          commercial town in the twelfth century. The ruins which remain
          belong to Roman times.

   Arles, Archbishopric of
          ARLES, ??rl, ARCHBISHOPRIC OF: An ancient see in southern France
          (44 m. n.w. of Marseilles), whose incumbents from the early part
          of the fifth century to the early part of the seventh, bore the
          title of primate, descriptive of their position as
          representatives of the Roman curia in that country and first
          among the bishops of the Gallic Church. The gospel was brought
          to Arles from Marseilles about the beginning, probably, of the
          third century and the first mention of a bishop of Arles occurs
          about 255. With the division of the empire by Diocletian and the
          subsequent rapid decline of Lyons, Arles rose to an eminent
          position as a commercial and administrative center and a
          stronghold of Roman civilization in Gaul. Its bishops, however,
          were formally under the authority of the bishop of Vienne as
          metropolitan till about the year 400 when Arles succeeded Treves
          as the residence of the prefect of Gaul, becoming, thereby, the
          capital of the Roman power in western Europe.

          The metropolitan rights of Vienne were thereupon brought into
          question, and, after a synod at Turin (401) had failed to arrive
          at a decision in the matter, a grant of extensive privileges was
          obtained in the year 417 from Pope Zosimus by Patroclus, bishop
          of Arles since 412. The territory of the see of Arles was
          increased at the expense of Marseilles, and upon Patroclus was
          conferred the title of metropolitan of the Viennois with
          authority over the episcopal sees of Narbonne and Aix. To raise
          the ecclesiastical authority of Arles to a degree commensurate
          with its political importance the pope conferred upon its bishop
          the title of primate, and with it, the power to intervene as
          arbiter in such disputed church questions as were not reserved
          for the decision of the bishop of Rome.

          The primacy of Arles had some justification and much of the
          authority which it rapidly gained from a legend which makes its
          appearance about this time connecting Arles with the name of
          Trophimus who, sent by the Apostle Peter to preach the gospel in
          Gaul, was reputed to have made that city the scene of his first
          labors. Subsequently the legendary Trophimus was identified with
          the person of that name mentioned in the New Testament (Acts xx.
          4, xxi. 29; II Tim. iv. 12). As a result of the dispute between
          Hilary, Bishop of Arles from 429 (see [569]Hilary, St., of
          Arles), and Pope Leo the Great, the primatial dignity was
          abolished in 445 and the office of metropolitan was transferred
          to Vienne. So firmly grounded, however, was the authority of
          Arles by this time that in 450 the claims of the church of
          Trophimus to the primacy and the vicariate were brought before
          the pope by nineteen bishops of Gaul, and though Leo refused to
          admit the validity of these claims he receded so far from his
          position as to divide the metropolitan dignity between Vienne
          and Arles. Actually, Arles retained such preeminence as to make
          it still the first of Gallic episcopates. The incursion of the
          Visigoths into Provence in 466 severed all relations between
          Arles and Rome for nearly thirty years, but the rise of the
          Arian power in southern France and in the north of Italy, led to
          a reestablishment of the Roman connection, in defense of the
          threatened cause of orthodoxy. Upon Cæsarius, bishop of Arles,
          was conferred, in 513, the pallium as token of the vicarial
          office (for the first time in the history of the Western Church)
          together with the right of exercising pastoral supervision over
          the churches in Gaul and Spain. As administrator and, more
          important still, as a formulator of ecclesiastical legislation
          Cæsarius made his influence felt throughout the country and
          traces of his work were to be found in Spain, Ireland, Italy,
          and Germany (see [570]Cæsarius of Arles). But with the rise of
          the national Frankish Church and the removal of the political
          center of the kingdom to the north the authority of the bishops
          of Arles rapidly declined. As late as 613 they appear in the
          character of papal vicars but their importance soon became
          second to that of the bishops of Lyons. In 794 the number of
          suffragans under the authority of the Archbishop of Arles was
          eight; in 1475 they numbered only four. The bishopric was
          abolished in 1802 but the title of primat des primats des Gaules
          is still borne by the archbishop of Vienne. [Among the
          ninety-six incumbents of the see the most distinguished, besides
          those already mentioned, were Vigilius (588-610), who was
          apostolic vicar under Gregory the Great over all the bishops of
          Burgundy and Austrasia, Cardinal Peter de Foix (1450-62), an
          important ecclesiastical statesman, and the last archbishop,
          Jean Marie Dulan (1775-92), who was guillotined at the age of
          eighty-seven by the revolutionary authorities.]

   Arles, Synods of
          ARLES, SYNODS OF: The first great western synod was held at
          Arles, in the presence of the emperor Constantine, who called
          it, and under the presidency of Marinus, the bishop of the
          place, in 314 (316 ?). Thirty-three bishops were present,
          representing almost all the western provinces, from Africa to
          Britain. The significance of the synod in regard to the Donatist
          controversy will be treated under [571]Donatism. The canons are
          principally interesting as showing how the Church endeavored to
          adapt itself to the alteration in its circumstances brought
          about by the recognition of Christianity. They declare that the
          acceptance of a government office is no reason for forsaking the
          fellowship of the Church, and that those who refused to serve in
          the army when summoned should be excommunicated, while they
          refused to consider charioteers and actors as members of the
          Church unless they renounced their professions. The principal
          enactments, however, related to clerical and lay discipline.
          Important regulations as to ecclesiastical usages were the
          prescription of unanimity in keeping Easter, the forbidding of
          the African custom of rebaptizing heretics, and the requirement
          of the presence of three bishops at least for an episcopal
          consecration. Another synod was held at Arles in 353 during the
          Arian controversy; it is not included in the usual enumeration.
          What is called the second synod was held in the fifth century,
          not before 443. Its 56 canons are mostly reaffirmations of older
          decrees. It is called in question by Duchesne (Fastes
          episcopaux, Paris, 1894, p. 141). The next synod, in 451,
          declared its adhesion to the "Tome of St. Leo" on the
          Incarnation. What is usually called the third, a few years
          later, decided a local dispute between a bishop and an abbot.
          After two more synods, in 463 and about 475 (for the latter see
          [572]Lucidus), the so called fourth met under the presidency of
          Cæsarius in 524, and was largely concerned with means for
          increasing the number of the clergy. The fifth was held in 554,
          to establish more firmly the episcopal authority. No others
          worth mentioning occur until the reforming synod of 813, held
          under Charlemagne's auspices and expressing his views. Another
          was held in 1234 in connection with the crusade against the
          Albigenses.

   Armagh, Bishopric of
          ARMAGH, BISHOPRIC OF: An ancient episcopal see in Ireland,
          traditionally reputed to have been founded by St. Patrick about
          445, and now existing in connection with both the Roman Catholic
          and the Anglican Churches. It had exclusive metropolitan
          jurisdiction over the whole of Ireland until 1152, when a
          national council at Kells provided for the elevation of three
          other sees, those of Cashel, Dublin, and Tuam, to archiepiscopal
          rank, Armagh still holding the primacy. Of the earlier
          archbishops the most famous was St. Malachy (d. 1148; see
          [573]Malachy O'Morgair, St.); the friend of St. Bernard and
          reformer of the Irish Church. Edward VI., in the course of his
          efforts to establish Protestantism, attempted to transfer the
          primacy to Dublin, and the Protestant Archbishop of Dublin is at
          present designated as "primate of Ireland," while his colleague
          of Armagh has been known as "primate of all Ireland" since the
          beginning of the eighteenth century. The Roman Catholic
          succession was maintained with the greatest difficulty in the
          later sixteenth and seventeenth centuries; one archbishop was
          assassinated, another died in the Tower of London, and a third
          (Plunket) was executed in 1681 on the charge of complicity in
          the "Popish Plot." The diocese comprises Louth, the greater part
          of Armagh and Tyrone, and a section of Derry. The Anglican
          diocese included that of Clogher from 1850 to 1886 when Clogher
          was restored as a separate jurisdiction. For additional details
          on the earlier history, see [574]Celtic Church in Britain and

          Armenia is a country situated in western Asia between the Black
          and Caspian Seas and the Taurus and Caucasus Mountains. In its
          widest extent it lay between 37 and 49° east longitude, 37° 30´
          and 41° 45´ north latitude. The Euphrates divided it into Great
          and Little Armenia, respectively east and west of the river. It
          is a lofty mountain-land with extensive plains, including the
          head waters of the Cynic (Kur) and Araxes (Aras), which flow
          northward to the Caspian ice, as well as of the Euphrates and
          Tigris. The mountains are well wooded and enclose deep and
          fruitful valleys. The winters are severe with mush snow, the
          summers dry and hot. The native geographers regarded their land
          as the middle of the world.

I. History:

  1. The Old Armenian Kingdom--to 600 B.C.

          The older history of Armenia is learned from Assyrian accounts
          and native cuneiform inscriptions. The Assyrians called the
          country Urartu (see [575]Assyria), corresponding to the Biblical
          land or kingdom of Ararat (II Kings xix. 37; Isa. xxxvii. 38;
          Jer. li. 27). The native name for the people is Chaldini from
          Chaldis, their chief god. The oldest inhabitants are
          distinguished from the later by their language, which is allied
          to the Ural-Altaic family. Originally living east of Lake Van,
          the Urarteans pressed to the south and east and founded a
          kingdom as rivals of the Assyria. Their capital was the
          well-fortified garden-city Van-Tuspa. The temple of the national
          god Chaldis became the center of the theocratically organized
          kingdom. By means of the Menuas canal (at present the Shamiram
          Su), King Menuas supplied his city with water. Under his son,
          Argistis I., against whom Shalmaneser III. (783-773 B.C.) had to
          fight six times, the kingdom reached its height, but
          Tiglath-Pileser soon made an end to its glory and in 735 B.C.
          the capital Tuspa was destroyed. The weakened kingdom,
          nevertheless, continued in constant enmity with the Assyrians.
          Thither the sons and murderers of Sennacherib fled in 681 B.C.
          In the course of time better relations were brought about
          between the two kingdoms, and till 640 B.C. ambassadors of the
          king of Urartu went to Nineveh. The prophet Jeremiah is the last
          who mentions the kingdom, and after this it disappears from
          history (cf. C. F. Lehmann, Das vorarmenische Reich von Van, in
          the Deutsche Rundschau, 1894-95, pp. 353-369; also articles by
          Lehmann and W. Belck in Zeitschrift für Ethnologie, xxiv., 1892,
          122-152, Zeitschrift für Assyriologie, vii., 1892, 255-267,
          Verhandlungen der Berliner Gesellschaft für Anthropologie, xxv.,
          1893, (61)-(82), and following years).

  2. Indo-Germanic Immigration. The Armenians.

          The advance of Indo-Germanic tribes in the sixth century B.C.
          added greatly to the population of Armenia. The Persians and
          Greeks called this new element Armenians, whereas the people
          call themselves Hayk, (plural of Hay) and their country
          Hayastan, claiming a mythical Hayk as their ancestor. The newly
          immigrated Indo-Germanic tribes absorbed the aborigines. The
          Armenians were at first under Median, afterward under Persian
          sway. They took part in the general revolt under Darius I.
          (after 521 B.C.), but, five times defeated, they remained quiet
          under the Achæmenidæ. In the time of Xenophon, Armenia was
          divided into an eastern and western satrapy. It reached the
          zenith of its power under Tigranes I. (about 90-55 B.C.), a
          descendant of Artaxias. He extended the bounds of his kingdom,
          and took the title of King of Kings, but in 66 B.C. Armenia was
          reduced to its old limits. From that time on the kingdom leaned
          either toward the Parthians or Romans, till it became a Roman
          province under Trajan (114-117).

  3. The Persian Period, 226-642.

          The overthrow of the Parthian Arsacidæ and the establishment of
          the rule of the Sassanidæ in Persia in 226 was of great
          importance for Armenia. As relatives of the dethroned legitimate
          heirs, the Armenian princes were the sworn enemies of the
          Persian kings. In 238 the Armenian King Chosrov was murdered at
          the instigation of the Persians. During the following
          disturbances the latter succeeded in occupying the country
          temporarily and forcing upon it the hated Mazdaism, till in 261,
          by the victory of Odenathus of Palmyra, the country received its
          freedom. The king's son Trdat (Tiridates), who had fled to Roman
          territory, restored the kingdom and maintained it in the closest
          connection with Rome and in continual struggle with the
          Persians. The conversion of the king and people to Christianity
          necessitated a policy friendly to Rome, which came to an end by
          the unhappy issue of Julian's campaign and the disgraceful peace
          of Jovian, 363. The Persians occupied Armenia and King Arsaces
          (Arshak) was made a prisoner. Valens, perceiving the great
          mistake, made Arshak's son Pap king (367-374). But the nobility
          and priests had the upper hand. From 378 to 385 the kingdom was
          governed by the clerically inclined Manuel the Mamikonian. In
          387 Theodosius the Great divided the kingdom with the Persians;
          the Romans received a piece of the West with Garin
          (Theodosiopolis), but four-fifths of Armenia came to Persia.
          Till 428 nominal Armenian kings ruled under Persian supremacy;
          then marzbans ("frontier-governors") were appointed, some of
          whom were Armenians. On the whole, the Persians showed great
          consideration for the country. Many revolts favoring the
          Byzantines were unsuccessful, but after the Emperor Maurice
          reinstalled Chosrov Parvez in 591, the latter peacefully ceded
          almost all Armenia to the empire. With the rise of the
          Mohammedan power it fell under Arab rule.

  4. The Califs and the Inroads of the Turks--to 1381.

          The first century of the califs was an epoch of national and
          literary development, and Ashot I., Bagratuni, belonging to an
          ancient Armenian dynasty, succeeded in 855 in becoming the
          prince of princes and in obtaining in 885 the royal crown from
          the calif. The new kingdom comprised not only Armenia, but also
          Albania and Iberia (Georgia). In 913 it became free, but was
          divided into petty kingdoms, of which that of the Artsrunians of
          Vaspurakan was the most important. Afraid of the aggressive
          Seljuks, Senekherim, the last Artsrunian, ceded his kingdom in
          1021, and Gagik the Bagratunian in 1041, to the Byzantines, but
          they, too, could not withstand the great danger. The systematic
          cruel devastation of the country by the hordes of the Seljuks
          gave the deathblow to the political life and civilization of the
          Armenians at home. During these campaigns many Armenians
          withdrew to the Taurus and Cilicia. In 1080 a certain Rupen,
          probably a Bagratide, founded a small kingdom and a new dynasty
          (Rupenides). His brave successors conquered all Cilicia. With
          Byzantium they were not on friendly terms, but their relation to
          the states of the crusaders was close. Levon II. was crowned
          king in 1198. The Rupenides were followed in 1342 by the
          Lusinians of Cyprus. In connection with the Mongols and the
          West, the kingdom tried to withstand the assault of the Egyptian
          Mamelukes. But in 1375 King Levon VI. had to give up his last
          fortress. He died at Paris in 1381. From that time on the
          Armenians have never had an independent kingdom.

II. Literature:

  1. Begins in the Fourth Century.

          An Armenian literature commences with the introduction of the
          Armenian writing. Until the fourth century they wrote Syriac,
          Greek, or Persian. Armenian works said to belong to this early
          time, are partly translations, partly later forgeries. The
          orations of Gregory the Illuminator (Venice, 1838; ed. Ter
          Mikelian, Vagharshabad, 1896; German, by J. F. Schmid,
          Regensburg, 1872) belong to a much later time. To his
          contemporary, Zenop Glak, a Syrian bishop and afterward abbot of
          the monastery Surp Garabed in Taron, a history of the conversion
          of his province is ascribed, said to have been originally
          written in Syriac. It is extant in an Armenian translation,
          "History of Taron," and is continued by Bishop John the
          Mamikonian, said to have lived in the seventh century. Both
          works are historically worthless, legendary writings of the
          eighth and ninth centuries. Under the name of Agathangelos,
          secretary of the Armenian king Trdat, a history of the
          conversion of the king and the introduction of Christianity is
          extant in Armenian and in Greek translation. It consists of
          independent writings relating to St. Gregory, united after 456
          (cf. A. von Gutschmid, Keine Schriften, iii., Leipsic,1892, 394
          sqq., 420). Of great value is the historical work of Faustus of
          Byzantium, containing the history of Armenia from 317 to 390 and
          written in Greek. Fragments are extant in Procopius (De bello
          Persico, i. 5), and the entire work--four books--in an Armenian
          translation.

  2. The Armenian Alphabet. Translations.

          The founders of the Armenian national literature are the
          catholicos Sahag (d. 439) and his friend and helper, Mesrob (d.
          440), the inventor of the Armenian alphabet. Till their time
          there existed no Armenian translation of the Holy Scriptures,
          and the Bible lessons and prayers were read either in Syriac or
          Greek. Mesrob's plan for a special alphabet for the Armenians
          was favored by Sahag and by King Vramshapuh (395-416). With the
          help of the Greek hermit and calligrapher Rufinus, the alphabet,
          mostly following the Greek, was produced (cf. H. Hübschmann,
          Ueber Aussprache und Umschreibung des Altarmenischen, in ZDMG,
          xxx., 1876, 53 sqq.; V. Gardthausen, Ueber dem griechischen
          Ursprung der armenischen Schrift, ibid. 74 sqq.). For the
          Iberians and Albanians, two neighboring nations but dependent
          upon Armenian culture, Mesrob also invented alphabets. The
          Armenian alphabet was first applied to the translation of the
          Bible. But as all Greek books had been destroyed, and the study
          of Greek was interdicted in the schools, the translation was
          made from the Syriac version, and not from the original text.
          Men were sent, however, to Constantinople to study the Greek
          language and examine authentic copies of the Scriptures; and the
          result of these exertions was a truly admirable translation,
          produced after 432 (see [576]Bible Versions, A, VI.). The
          liturgical books for the church service, the church history of
          Eusebius, and, the life of St. Anthony by Athanasius, were also
          translated into Armenian. Of translations, the Greek text of
          which has perished, the following may be mentioned: Certain
          treatises of Philo; the chronicle of Eusebius; the apology of
          Aristides; homilies of Severianus of Gabala; the commentaries of
          Ephraem Syrus on the Bible; and certain writings of Basil the
          Great, Chrysostom, Cyril of Jerusalem, Athanasius, and others.
          All these works belong to the golden period. To the later school
          of translators are attributed translations of Plato's works,
          Aristotle's categories, and Porphyry's commentary on them,
          Ignatius' shorter epistles, writings of Hippolytus, Epiphanius,
          Gregorius Thaumaturgus, Euthalius, and others.

  3. Original Armenian Lieterature. Moses of Chorene.

          The original literature of the Armenians is almost exclusively
          historical and theological. To Mesrob's pupil, Eznik of Kulb, is
          due a work against heretics, and Mesrob's biographer, Koriun,
          wrote an authentic record of the beginnings of Armenian
          literature. More famous is Moses of Chorene (Moses Chorenensis),
          author of a history of Armenia to the death of Mesrob (440), the
          only native source for the pre-Christian period of the country.
          It probably originated in the seventh or early eighth century
          and was first published at Amsterdam, 1695, and with a Latin
          translation by W: and G. Whiston, London, 1736; the best edition
          is that of the Mekhitarists (Venice, 1843) in the complete
          edition of Moses's works; French transl., in Langlois, ii. 45
          sqq., German by M. Lauer (Regensburg, 1869). To Moses is also
          ascribed a rhetoric and geography, edited with the history by
          the Whistons; a better recension is offered by A. Soukry, in his
          French and Armenian edition (Venice, 1881; cf. von Gutschmid, ut
          sup., 282 sqq., 322 sqq.; A. Carrière, Moïse de Khoren et les
          généologies patriarcales, Paris, 1891, and Nouvelles sources de
          Moïse de Khoren, Vienna,1893).

          One of the most eminent of Armenian historians is Eghishe
          (Elisæus) Vartabed, author of a history of the religious war of
          the Armenians against the Persians under Yezdigerd II., 439-451
          (Eng. transl., by C. F. Neumann, London, 1830). His junior
          contemporary, Lazar of Parpi, wrote a history of Armenia from
          388 to 405. John Mandakuni, catholicos 480-487, wrote homilies
          and prayers. To the seventh century belongs Bishop Sebeos'a
          history of Heraclius. Toward the end of the century the church
          history of Socrates was translated into Armenian, and an
          orthodox Armenian wrote in Greek an important but partial sketch
          of Armenian church history from Gregory the Illuminator to his
          own time.

  4. The Eighth and Succeeding Centuries.

          To the eighth century belong John of Odzun, surnamed the
          Philosopher, and Stephen, archbishop of Siunik, who translated
          the writings of Dionysius Areopagita, Cyril of Alexandria,
          Nemesius, Athanasius, Gregory of Nyssa, and others; also the
          epistle of the patriarch Germanus to the Armenians. In the same
          century Armenian translations were made of the writings of
          Georgius Pisida, Hesychius of Jerusalem, Theodore of Ancyra,
          Evagrius, Antipater of Bostra, Johannes Climacus, and Titus of
          Crete. Toward the end of the century Levond (Leontius), "the
          great Vartabed," wrote a history of the Arabian inroads into
          Armenia and the wars with the Empire, 661-788

          To the tenth century belong two historical works, one by the
          catholicos John, an Armenian history from the beginning to the
          year 925; the other by Thomas Artsruni, giving the history of
          the Artsrunians to 936. In the same century lived Chosrov the
          Great, who wrote an exposition of the Armenian breviary; Mesrob
          the Priest, the biographer of Nerses the Great and author of a
          history of the Georgians and Armenians; and Gregory of Narek, a
          celebrated writer of hymns, prayers, homilies, etc. Historians
          include Uchtanes, Bishop (of Urha, i.e., Edessa ?), and Moses of
          Kalankaituk. To the eleventh century belong Stephen Asolik of
          Taron, author of a history to the year 1004; Aristakes of
          Lazdiverd, who in his history from 989 to 1071 describes the
          catastrophe of Armenia caused by the Seljuks; and Gregorios
          Magistros (1058), whose letters are important for contemporary
          history.

          Another flourishing period is the twelfth century under the
          reign of the dynasty of the Rupenides. To this time belong
          Nerses Klayetsi or Shnorhali, catholicos 1166-73, who wrote
          poems and prayers, the latter translated into thirty-six
          languages; Ignatius, author of a commentary on Luke; Sarkis
          Shnorhali, who wrote on the catholic epistles; Matthew of
          Edessa, whose history, comprising the period from 952 to 1132,
          and continued by Gregory the Priest to 1162, contains many
          interesting notices concerning the crusades; Samuel of Ani,
          author of a chronicle to the year 1179, continued later to 1664;
          Nerses of Lambron, Archbishop of Tarsus, whose dogmatic works
          and spiritual addresses are published with the dogmatic letters
          of Gregory Tla, catholicos 1173-80; Michael the Great, patriarch
          of the Syrians 1166-99, who wrote a chronicle to the year 1198;
          and Mekhitar Gosh (d. 1213), author of 190 fables.

          The thirteenth century was also rich in authors. Vartan the
          Great wrote a chronicle to the year 1268, and an exposition of
          Biblical passages. Giragos of Gandsak wrote a history consisting
          of two parts: one comprising the older Armenian history to 1165;
          the other contemporaneous, treating of the Mongols, Iberians,
          and the author's country, Albania, to 1265. His contemporary,
          the monk Maghakia wrote a history of the Mongolian inroads to
          1272. Stephen Orbelian; archbishop of Siunik 1287-1304, wrote a
          history of Siunik. Sempad, brother of King Hetum I. (1224-69),
          composed a chronicle to 1274, continued to 1331. Mekhitar of
          Ayrivank wrote a chronography to 1289. To the period of decay
          belong Thomas of Metsop, of the fifteenth century, author of a
          history of Timur and his successors. To the seventeenth century
          belongs Arakel of Tabriz, author of a history from 1602 to 1661.
          With the eighteenth century commences the literary activity of
          the [577]Mekhitarists and an entirely new era, animated by
          Western science.

III. The Armenian Church:

  1. Legends.

          Armenia has the glory of being the first land which made
          Christianity the religion of the country. Later legend places
          the first preaching of Christian doctrine there in the apostolic
          time and claims for the land the graves of the four apostles,
          Bartholomew, Thaddæus (Lebbæus), Simon, and Judas. The most
          prominent and important are Bartholomew and Thaddæus, and they
          are often mentioned alone. Sometimes two Thaddæi are
          distinguished--the apostle, and one of the seventy. These are
          the apostles whose activity the older legend has placed in the
          East, and these legends, mostly of Greek or Syriac origin, were
          worked over and enlarged by the Armenians in a relatively late
          time; the product can be seen in the historical work of Moses of
          Chorene. The Bartholomew legend is evidently the oldest; Greek
          testimonies of the fifth century know of his death by martyrdom
          in Urbanopolis (Albanopolis, Xerbanopolis; etc.), an otherwise
          unknown city of Great Armenia. But the importance of Bartholomew
          does not come up to that of Thaddeeus. The legend of Abgar, King
          of Edema (see [578]Abgar), of his correspondence with Jesus and
          the sending of Thaddæus to Edessa, enjoyed at an early period
          great popularity in Armenia. The Armenian form of the legend is
          extant in a translation of the Docrina Adddæi ("Labubna of
          Edessa, Abgar's letter, or History of the Conversion of the
          Edessenes," Armen., Venice and Jerusalem, 1868, French by
          Alishan, Venice, 1868, by Emin in Langlois, ii. 313 sqq.).

  2. Gregory the Illuminator.

          There can be no doubt that Christianity was introduced in
          Armenia very early. Before Gregory the Illuminator, the true
          apostle of Armenia, Merujan, the bishop of the Armenians, wrote
          a letter on repentance (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., VI. xlvi. 2) to
          Dionysius of Alexandria (248-265). A new epoch begins with
          Gregory. According to unreliable tradition, Anak, a scion of the
          noble house of Suren Pahlav, the murderer of King Chosrov (d.
          238), was his father. Like many other Armenian princes he sought
          refuge on Roman territory during the Persian occupation. At
          Cæsarea he received a Christian and Greek education, which was
          of the utmost importance for the entire ecclesiastical
          development of Armenia. When the Armenian kingdom was retaken
          and reorganised, Gregory was one of the most zealous helpers of
          the king. But with the restoration of the kingdom was also
          connected the restitution of the national religion, which had
          been supplanted by Persian fire-worship. As a Christian, Gregory
          refused to offer chaplets upon the altar of the great goddess
          Anahid on the national festival arranged by the king, and
          professed to be a Christian. The enraged king subjected him to
          cruel torture; legend speaks of his confinement in a pit for
          thirteen years. At last the king was converted by a miracle
          (Sozomen, ii. 8), and then the Christianizing of the country was
          undertaken by both. At the head of the army, Trdat and Gregory
          marched to the ancient capital Artaxata; the temple of Anahid
          and the oracle of Tiur with its school of priests were destroyed
          after a stout resistance, and all the temple property was given
          to the Christian churches. In the same manner they acted in West
          Armenia. At the request of the king, Gregory, accompanied by a
          retinue of Armenian feudal princes, went to Cæsarea, and was
          consecrated primate of Armenia by Leontius. From Cappadocia
          Gregory brought the relics of John the Baptist (Surp Garabed)
          and Athenogenes (Atanagines), who were now made the national
          saints. Gregory then went south and at Ashtishat in the country
          of Taron destroyed the most celebrated sanctuary of the country,
          the temple of Vahagn, Anahid, and Astghik, and in its place the
          splendid Christ-Church, "the first and great church, the mother
          of all Armenian churches," was erected. From Taron Gregory went
          to the province of Ararat, where stood the famous sanctuary of
          the god Vanatur of Bagavan. This, too, was turned into a church
          of St. John and St. Athenogenes, and the people who had gathered
          there from the northeast were baptized.

  3. History to 600.

          Three things may be noticed in this newly constituted Armenian
          Church. First, its national character. Gregory preached in the
          native tongue; the sons of the former idolatrous priests were
          educated in a Christian school, which formed the seminary for
          future bishops; pupils of this school gradually occupied the
          twelve episcopal sees, established by Gregory. The second
          feature is the compulsory conversion, and the third the Judaic
          character of the church. The patriarchate has its parallel
          rather in the Jewish high-priesthood than in specific Christian
          distinctions; like the episcopate, it became hereditary in some
          families. The superior clergy, as a rule, were married. Gregory
          was followed by his younger son, Aristakes, who in 325 attended
          the Council of Nicæa; then by his elder son Vrtanes, who made
          his elder son Gregory catholicos of the Iberians and Albanians.
          Nerses, great-grandson of Vrtanes, ordained catholicos at the
          urgent wish of king and people, in 365 convened a synod at
          Ashtishat, which regulated marriages between relatives, limited
          the excessive mourning over the dead, and founded the first
          monasteries, the first asylums for widows, orphans, and the
          sick, and the first caravansaries for travelers. King Arshag,
          displeased with the order of things; appointed an
          anticatholicos, but when Arshag was made prisoner by the
          Persians, Nerses acted as regent for the minor king Pap
          (367-374). As soon as the latter became of age he abolished many
          things introduced by Nerses, and poisoned him before 374. Basil
          of Cæsarea anathematized the Armenian kingdom and refused to
          consecrate a new catholicos. But King Pap found pliant clerics
          who were willing to receive ordination from native bishops.
          After Nerses's death Armenia was definitely freed from all
          spiritual connection with Cæsarea and made ecclesiastically
          independent. About 390 Sahag the Great, the Parthian, Nerses'
          son, was made catholicos. His government forms the most
          important turning-point of the Armenian Church. Like his father
          he promoted monasticism; he opposed the deposition of the last
          king Ardashes and the turning of Armenia into a Persian satrapy
          (428). But the nobility had its way and the Persian government,
          by making use of this opposition, deposed the influential Sahag
          and appointed two Syrians in succession as catholicoi. Through
          the efforts of Sahag and Mesrob, the Syrian language was now
          superseded by the Armenian. The continued connection with Greece
          preserved the Armenian Church from being crippled and isolated.
          At the request of the nobility, Sahag was again made catholicos,
          before he died (Sept. 15, 439). He was the last in the male line
          of the family of Gregory the Illuminator. The family estate went
          to his daughter's sons, the Mamikonians, whereas the dignity of
          catholicos, after Greco-Oriental custom, was now given to monks.
          Sahag's successor, Joseph, held a synod at Sahapivan to remove
          certain abuses. The Council of Chalcedon (451), which later
          Armenians condemned, had no effect upon the contemporaries,
          because King Yezdigerd II. (438--457) endeavored to make
          Mazdaism the ruling religion in Armenia. The princes yielded at
          first, but soon the people revolted, and the magi and their
          temples had to suffer. Vartau the Mamikonian stood at the head,
          but the Armenians were defeated in 451 and many of the nobles
          and clerics were deported to Persia, where they suffered
          martyrdom after many years of imprisonment. One of these martyrs
          was Joseph the catholicos (454). The persecution ceased in 484,
          and during the time of peace which now followed, the Armenians
          were wholly influenced by the ruling Greek-Oriental theology,
          and Zeno's Henotikon (482) became their rule of faith. The synod
          at Vagharshabad, which was convened in 491 by the catholicos
          Babken and which was attended not only by the Armenian bishops
          but also by the Albanian and Iberian, solemnly condemned the
          Council of Chalcedon. This synod is epoch-making in the Armenian
          Church. From now on the Armenians, as well as the Syrians and
          Egyptians accept only the strict Monophysitie doctrine as
          orthodox (cf. A. Ter Mikelian, Die armenische Kirche in ihren
          Beziehungen zur byzantinischen, Leipsic, 1892). With the Persian
          government the clergy had thus far lived in peace. But an effort
          to erect a temple of fire in the capital Duin in 571 led to a
          massacre of the magi and Persians. The Armenians for the time
          being attached themselves to the Romans. Many priests and the
          catholicos fled to Constantinople, where the latter died.
          Armenia remained under Persian sway.

  4. To 1166.

          A new epoch in the Armenian Church begins under Emperor
          Heraclius. After he had restored the cross to Jerusalem in 829,
          he opened negotiations with the Monophysites of Syria, which
          seemed to favor a union. The Armenian catholicos Ezr also shared
          in them, and partook with the emperor in the celebration of the
          eucharist. The union lasted during the lifetime of Heraclius.
          The rise of Islam changed the country's policy toward Rome. The
          national hatred between Armenians and Greeks became moat
          violent. The Greek soldiers stationed in Armenia complained that
          they were treated like infidels. Nerses III., Ezr's successor,
          had been educated in Greece and secretly favored the
          Chalcedonian Council (i.e., the Monothelite doctrine), but the
          synod at Duin, which met at the wish of the emperor under the
          presidency of Nerses, condemned again in the most solemn manner
          the Council of Chalcedon. But when in 652 the emperor
          Constantine appeared at Duin, the decisions of Chalcedon were
          solemnly proclaimed on Sunday in the main church; the catholicos
          and the bishops received the sacrament from a Greek priest.
          Justinian II. (689-690) succeeded in making a new union with the
          catholicos Sahag III. (677-703) and his bishop, whom he had
          called to Constantinople; but having returned to their homes,
          they repudiated it. Under the patriarchate of Elia (703-713),
          Nerses Bakur, catholicos of the Albanians, and Queen Sparam
          tried to introduce the Chalcedonian belief into their country.
          But the Armenian catholicos protested against them to the calif
          Abd al-Malik and with the help of Arabian soldiers the two
          leaders were taken to Damascus bound in chains and the Albanian
          orthodoxy was saved. During the ninth and tenth centuries under
          the rule of the Bagratunians the Church became again
          influential. Many monasteries were built, and many theologians
          and famous ascetics are mentioned. Even Monophysitic
          coreligionists from Colchis and the Roman empire entered the
          Armenian monasteries. But this growth of religious life also
          developed hatred of the Greeks. In vain was the correspondence
          between the patriarch Photius and the catholicos Zakaria
          (853-876). The very friendly letters of Nicolaus Mysticus and of
          the catholicos John the Historian (897-925), touched merely upon
          the oppressed condition of the Armenian empire, avoiding all
          theological questions. Anania (943-965), however, following the
          counsel of "the deep thinkers" advised to rebaptize the Greeks.
          His mild successor, Vahanik, being suspected of heresy, was
          deposed. An effort of the zealous metropolitan of Sebastia to
          discuss again the question of the two natures, was frustrated by
          the catholicos Khachik (971-990) in a long letter still extant
          (Stephanus Asolik, iii. 21) and the orthodox Armenian doctrine
          was defended by quotation from the Fathers. Khachik's successor,
          Sargis (992-1019) resided at Ani, the famous residence of the
          Bagratuniang, where Queen Katramide, wife of Gagik (989-1020)
          had built a splendid cathedral. A hard time began for the
          Armenian Church when in the ninth century the realm was annexed
          by the Byzantine empire. A large orthodox hierarchy was
          established in the new provinces. At the head stood a
          metropolitan with the title of Keltzene, Kortzene, and Taron,
          besides twenty-one bishops. Of course, they were shepherds
          without sheep. The Greeks continued their efforts to force upon
          the Armenians the Chalcedonian faith. The opposition was much
          strengthened by the ill-treatment of the higher clergy. Khachik
          II. (1058-65) was kept a prisoner at Constantinople for three
          years. The revenues of the catholicos decreased to such a degree
          that the incumbent often was in want. But with Vahram, the son
          of Krikor, catholicos 1065-1105, the patriarchate became again
          hereditary, as in the beginning. Krikor's seven successors till
          1202 were his relatives on either the father's or mother's side.
          They were called Pahlavuni, because they traced back their
          supposed pedigree to Gregory the Illuminator and the Suren
          Pahlav. There is no doubt that this family rendered great
          services to the Armenian Church in different times. Jealousy and
          self-interests were sometimes the cause of anticatholicoi, whose
          number at times was four. But the people only considered those
          as lawful who belonged to Gregory's house. In 1147 Gregory III.
          Pahlavuni (1113-66) bought of the widow of Count Jocelin of
          Edessa the fortress Hromkla, which remained the residence of the
          Armenian catholicoi till 1293.

  5. Negotiations for Union with Roman and the Greek Church.

          The close relation between the Armenian kingdom of Cilicia and
          the Latin states of Syria and Palestine, soon brought the
          Armenian Church into closer contact with Rome. At first the
          Armenians welcomed the crusaders as enemies of the Greeks. But
          they soon changed their minds when they had to suffer (as, e.g.,
          in Edessa) under their rule. Negotiations for a union were soon
          resumed. From political motives the kings especially, sometimes
          also the catholicoi, favored these ineffectual negotiations.
          Levon II., "because he ascribed his greatness to the apostles
          Peter and Paul in Rome," wished to obtain a royal crown from
          Pope Celestine III. and Emperor Henry VI. Conrad of Wittelsbach,
          Archbishop of Mainz, brought the crown in 1198 with three papal
          injunctions: (1) To celebrate the principal festivals on the
          same days as the Roman Church; (2) Continual devotion by day and
          night; (3) To fast on Christmas-eve and Easter-eve. The king
          pacified the nobles and the clergy with the words "Be not
          disturbed, I will play the hypocrite." During the fourteenth and
          fifteenth centuries a small fraction of the Armenian nation had
          become definitely united with Rome. The Vartabed John of Cherni
          learned the Latin language from the Dominican Bartholomew and in
          connection with him founded a special branch of the Dominicans,
          the Unitores. He introduced the Latin language into the service
          of the Church, declared the Armenian sacraments invalid,
          rebaptized the laymen, and reordained the ministers who followed
          him. One of his adherents, Nerses Balienz, bishop of Urmia, who
          with others had been expelled from the Church and driven from
          Armenia, in order to revenge himself went to Avignon and
          calumniated the Armenian Church before the pope, charging it
          with one hundred and seventeen errors. They were communicated to
          the catholicos, refuted at a synod in Sis in 1342, and the pope
          was satisfied by this thorough refutation. The fanatical action
          of the Unitores generally effected the very opposite result.
          With the Greeks, too, negotiations concerning union took place.
          Emperor Manuel Comnenus after 1165 corresponded with Nerses IV.
          Shnorhali (catholicos 1166-73). This correspondence was
          continued by Nerses' successor Gregory IV. (1173-80); but the
          Synod of Hromkla (1179) rejected all proposals of the Greeks.
          The death of Manuel (1180) and of the catholicos Gregory, who
          was disposed toward a union, made an end to all union endeavors.
          Another effort made in 1196 by the "ecumenical" council at
          Tarsus in the interest of King Levon II. was also fruitless.
          During the Persian persecutions the Armenians migrated to the
          West. Rich mercantile colonies existed, especially in Poland.
          The escaped catholicos Melkiseth died at Lemberg in 1625, after
          having founded a bishopric there for which he had consecrated
          Nikolaios. At the instance of the Jesuits the latter joined the
          union.

  6. From 1600.

          With the seventeenth century a new period begins for the
          Armenians. From Echmiadzin (Vagharshabad), the seat of the
          catholicos, clerics were sent out to establish Armenian printing
          offices. Such were established at Lemberg 1616, at Julfa and
          Leghorn 1640, at Amsterdam 1660 (transferred to Marseilles in
          1672), at Constantinople 1677, and elsewhere. Till then the
          Armenians were little better educated than the Syrians or Copts.
          The merit of making them acquainted with European culture
          belongs to Mekhitar and his order, the [579]Mekhitarists. In
          1828 Persian Armenia came under Russian away, and again a new
          period commenced for the national Church.

          The national Armenian Church, whose adherents are erroneously
          called Gregorians, considers as its head the "supreme patriarch
          and catholicos of all Armenians," residing at Echmiadzin, who is
          elected by a national council consisting of members of all
          Armenian eparchies. Connected with the patriarchal see is a
          theological-philosophical academy. An incomplete catalogue of
          the library at Echmiadzin was published by Brosset (Catalogue de
          la bibliothèque d'Edschmiadzin publié par M. Brosset, St.
          Petersburg, 1840). Besides the supreme patriarchate there are
          two lower ones, those of Jerusalem and Constantinople.

  7. The Armenian Uniates.

          The Armenians who are united with the Roman See (the so called
          Uniates or United Armenians) have maintained themselves since
          the times of the crusaders and the Unitores, and gradually
          increased in numbers. Several catholicoi negotiated with Rome,
          but the clergy and people remained anti-Roman. When, however,
          the order of Mekhitarists was established, a catholicate in
          connection with Rome was founded. Abraham Attar-Muradian in 1721
          founded in the Lebanon the monastery of Kerem, which accepted
          the rule of St. Anthony (see [580]Antonians, 1). His successors
          besides their own names take also that of the prince of the
          apostles. For the better regulation of the affairs of the
          Catholic and United Armenians, Pius IX. issued, July 12, 1867,
          the bull Reversurus. But a great portion of the United,
          protected by the Turkish government, did not recognize the
          injunctions of the bull, and in 1870 they renounced the Roman
          See, calling themselves Oriental Catholics. The most prominent
          men among the United and most of the Venetian Mekhitarists sided
          with them. On May 20, 1870, Pope Pius IX. suspended many
          priests, and when they did not yield, he excommunicated four
          bishops and forty-five other priests. The result was that the
          separatists now formed an independent organization under the
          civil patriarch John Kapelian, who, however, submitted to Pope
          Leo XIII. in 1879. In 1880 Anton Hassun was made the first
          Armenian cardinal. He died at Rome in 1884. His successor as
          patriarch of Cilicia with residence at Constantinople was
          Stephen Azarian, surnamed Stephanus Petrus X., to whom the pope
          sent an encyclical in 1888, in which the preservation of the
          Armenian language and liturgy for religious purposes is
          guaranteed to the Armenians, and everything is confirmed which
          Benedict XIV. enjoined concerning their own and other Oriental
          liturgies (of. D. Vernier, Histoire du patriarchat Arménien
          catholique, Paris, 1890).

          According to Missiones catholicæ cura S. Congregationis de
          propaganda fide descriptæ anno 1901, the present status of the
          Armenians united with Rome is as follows: The seat of the
          Armenian patriarch of Cilicia is Constantinople. The diocese
          comprises 16,000 Catholic Armenians; 13 congregations; 85
          priests (including 16 Mekhitarists of Venice, 10 of Vienna, and
          14 Antonians); 5 boys' and 7 girls' schools; 2 colleges besides
          the seminary of the patriarch and 1 lyceum; the convent of the
          Mekhitarists of Venice at Kadikeuy, of those of Vienna at
          Pancaldi, of the Antonians at Ortakeuy; one monastery of the
          Sisters of the Immaculate Conception. To the jurisdiction of the
          patriarch belong also l5 bishoprics. Excluded from this
          supervision are the dioceses of Alexandria in Egypt, Artuin in
          Russia, and Lemberg in Austria, whose archbishop has been named
          since 1819 by the emperor of Austria. The United Armenians, not
          including those in Hungary, in Russia outside of the eparchy of
          Artuin, and in Persia, number about 100,000 according to the
          lists of the propaganda.

  8. The Evangelical Armenians.

          The evangelical movement among Armenians had its origin early in
          the nineteenth century in several attempts to revive religion is
          the Eastern Churches. A large number of Armenians in Turkey,
          inhabiting Cilicia and central and southern Asia Minor, have
          lost their own language, speaking Turkish, but writing it with
          Armenian letters. They are quite unable to understand the
          Armenian church books. In 1815 two Armenian ecclesiastics
          prepared a version of the New Testament in Turkish for these
          people, which was afterward printed (1819) at St. Petersburg.
          About the same time the Church Missionary Society of London sent
          a mission to Malta to advance the cause of religion in the Greek
          and other Oriental Church. This mission came in contact with
          Armenians before its abandonment in 1830. In 1823 the Basel
          Mission Institute sent two of its graduates, Mr. Zaremba (who
          was a Russian count by birth) and Mr. Pfander (afterward
          renowned as a missionary to Mohammedans in India and in Turkey).
          These men, driven from the Caucasus by the Czar Nicholas I.,
          left a strong evangelical Armenian body, which still perseveres,
          at Shushi, Shemakhi, and Baku. About this time as Armenian
          scholar of Constantinople, acting for the British Bible Society,
          translated the New Testament into modern, or colloquial
          Armenian, the ancient and ecclesiastical language being
          unintelligible to the common people. This was published at Paris
          in 1823, and became another of the influences vaguely at work
          for reform.

          The chief advance in this direction same through the American
          Board, of Boston, Mass., which sent missionaries to Turkey in
          1819 and has steadily prosecuted its purpose of enlightening the
          members of the Oriental Churches up to this time. Turkey being
          in turmoil at this time, the mission printing-press was
          established at Malta; explorations were made throughout Syria,
          Greece, Egypt, Asia Minor, and finally, in 1830-31, through a
          large part of Eastern Turkey besides the Caucasus and Persia. As
          a result, stations of the American Board were founded among the
          Armenians at Smyrna (1820), Constantinople (1831), Brousa, and
          Trebizond (1833). The printing plant for Armenian, Turkish, and
          Greek was removed from Malta to Smyrna in 1835 and there Bible
          work was pressed forward. A translation of the Bible into modern
          Armenian, by Elias Riggs, was published in 1852, and the
          translation of the Bible into Turkish written with Armenian
          letters by William Goodell was published in 1841--the first
          translation of the Old Testament into this language. These two
          translations placed the Bible within reach of all the Armenians
          of the Turkish empire. In 1904 the circulation of the Scriptures
          among Armenians in Turkey amounted to nearly 30,000 copies.

          The purpose of the American Board in entering the field of the
          Armenian Church was by no means hostile to it. Not the Armenians
          but the assurance of the Mohammedans that they had tested
          Christianity and found it wanting was the real objective. The
          first missionaries at Constantinople laid their plans before the
          Armenian patriarch, and during twelve years had his friendly
          approval, especially for their schools. A less liberal patriarch
          punished with severe persecution from 1845 to 1847 Armenians who
          had adopted the idea of individual study of the Bible. Finally
          the British Government interfered in behalf of religious
          liberty, solemnly proclaimed by the Sultan in the Hatti Sherif
          of 1839. All Armenians who chose to escape the pains of the ban
          by declaring themselves Protestants were protected by Turkish
          police against the rancor of the patriarch; and in 1852-54 the
          "Protestant Community" as it is officially called, or the
          "Evangelical Community" as it is called by its members, was
          formally recognised, with a layman as its representative before
          the throne, and with all the rights of a separate religious
          organization. Since then evangelical Greeks, Bulgarians,
          Syrians, Jews, etc., have been added to this body.

          The American Board's missions among the Armenians have extended
          throughout Asiatic Turkey, to the Persian frontier on the east,
          and to the Arabic-speaking provinces of Syria and Mesopotamia on
          the south. The central stations number 13 and the outstations
          241, with 161 missionaries (of whom 63 are unmarried women) and
          956 native workers. The communicants in its congregations (1905)
          number 14,542, and the adherents 50,738. It should be noted,
          however, that separate statistics of the Armenians in these
          congregations are not kept. It is perhaps safe to estimate them
          at about seventy percent of the whole number. Educational work
          is extensive and effective. There are 22,152 scholars of all
          grades and both sexes is the 529 primary and intermediate
          schools, the six colleges for men and women, and the four
          theological seminaries, which receive candidates for the
          ministry of the Old Armenian Church as well as those of the
          Evangelical body. Robert College at Constantinople, founded by
          Christopher Robert of New York with Cyrus Hamlin for its first
          president, is not included in these statistics. It is not
          connected with the mission, nor is it in any sense propagandist.
          Yet its liberal education of Armenians has tended to strengthen
          the position of the Evangelical Armenian body. A publishing
          house at Constantinople, removed from Smyrna in 1853, and with
          uninterrupted productiveness since it was founded in Malta in
          1822, issues school books, religious books, hymnals,
          commentaries, and other helps to the study of the Bible, besides
          a family newspaper that appears in an Armenian and a Turkish
          edition.

          A small number of Armenians have joined the evangelical movement
          through the mission of the (American) Disciples of Christ. Many,
          whose statistics are not separately kept, have connected
          themselves with the American Presbyterian missions in Persia.
          Reckoning all these together, and adding to them the evangelical
          Armenians in the Russian Caucasus and is the territory taken
          from Turkey in the war of 1877-78, the total number of
          Evangelical Armenians may be estimated in these countries at
          about 80,000.

  9. Armenians in America.

          Armenian immigration to the United States practically commenced
          in 1895 after the massacres of that time. A few had come earlier
          for education, business, or manufacturing, and there were small
          communities in a few of the larger cities. After that the number
          increased rapidly. The census of 1900 makes no distinction of
          races from Turkey, though the later immigration reports do. It
          thus follows that exact figures are scarcely obtainable. The
          best estimates place the total (1906) at not far from 30,000, of
          whom from 7,500 to 10,000 may be considered as Protestants or
          Evangelicals, the remainder belonging to the Gregorian or
          Orthodox Church. The largest single community, practically a
          colony, is at Fresno, Cal., where at least 4,000 are located.
          The other centers are New York City (3,500-4,000), Boston
          (2,500), Worcester,. Mass. (1,200), Providence. R. I. (1,200),
          and Philadelphia (500). In the immediate suburbs of Boston and
          the manufacturing towns of Eastern Massachusetts and New
          Hampshire, in Hartford, and in New Jersey there are a number of
          communities of varying size and changing from year to year.

          The Protestant Armenians have organized churches in New York
          City, Troy, N. Y., Worcester, Mass., Providence, R. I., and
          Fresno, Cal., besides a number of missions, or places where
          services, more or less regular, are held. The great majority are
          connected with the Congregational denomination, but there are
          Presbyterians. The Gregorians have an archbishop at Worcester,
          and vartabeds or priests at New York, Worcester, Providence,
          Boston, and Fresno. These visit other places in their vicinity
          to perform rites or ceremonies that may be desired. They have
          church buildings at Worcester and Fresno. The attendance upon
          church services is said to be on the whole excellent in those
          communities where there are regular organizations. It is to be
          noted that there are many small communities where members
          identify themselves with the local churches.

          In general character the Armenians in the United States show
          much the same characteristics as in their own country. They are
          industrious, frugal, peaceable. They retain a close connection
          with their relatives and friends in the home-land as is shown by
          the sums annually remitted to them. With the exception of the
          Fresno colony, chiefly agricultural, they are for the most part
          traders, manufacturers, or laborers in the large factories. They
          preserve to a considerable degree their distinctive nationalism
          and were the conditions in Turkey to change, would probably
          return in large numbers.

   Arminius, Jacobus, and Arminianism
          ARMINIUS, JACOBUS (Jakob Hermanss), AND ARMINIANISM: A Dutch
          theologian and the theological system he is supposed to have
          held. Arminius was born at Oudewater (18 m. e.n.e. of Rotterdam)
          Oct. 10, 1560; d. at Leyden Oct. 19, 1609. After his father's
          early death he lived with Rudolphus Snellius, professor in
          Marburg. In 1576 he returned home and studied theology at Leyden
          under Lambertus Danæus. Here he spent six years, till he was
          enabled by the burgomasters of Amsterdam to continue his studies
          at Geneva and Basel under Beza and Grynæus. He lectured on the
          philosophy of Petrus Ramus and the Epistle to the Romans. Being
          recalled by the government of Amsterdam, in 1588 he was
          appointed preacher of the Reformed congregation. During the
          fifteen years which he spent here, he gained the general
          respect, but his views underwent a change. His exposition of
          Rom. vii. and ix., and his utterances on election and
          reprobation gave offense. His learned but hot-headed colleague,
          Petrus Plancius, in particular opposed him. Disputes arose in
          the consistory, which for the time being were stopped by the
          burgomasters.

          Arminius was suspected of heresy because he regarded the
          subscription to the symbolical books as not binding and was
          ready to grant to the State more power in ecclesiastical matters
          than the strict Calvinists would admit. When two of the
          professors of the University of Leyden, Junius and Trelcatius,
          died (1602), the curators called Arminius; and [581]Franciscus
          Gomarus (q.v.), the only surviving theological professor,
          protested, but he became reconciled after an interview with
          Arminius. The latter entered upon his duties in 1603 with an
          address on the high-priestly office of Christ, and was made
          doctor of theology. But the dogmatic disputes were renewed when
          Arminius undertook public lectures on predestination. Gomarus
          opposed him and published other theses. A great excitement
          ensued in the university and the students were divided into two
          parties. The ministers in Leyden and other places took part in
          the controversy, which became general. The Calvinists wanted the
          matter settled by a general synod, but the States General would
          not have it. Oldenbarneveldt, the Dutch liberal statesman, in
          1608 gave both opponents opportunity to defend their views
          before the supreme court, and a verdict was pronounced that
          since the controversy had no bearing upon the main points
          pertaining to salvation, each should bear with the other. But
          Gomarus would not yield. Even the States of Holland tried to
          bring about a reconciliation between the two, and in Aug., 1609,
          both professors and four ministers for each were invited to
          undertake new negotiations. The deliberations were first held
          orally, afterward continued in writing, but were terminated in
          October by the death of Arminius.

          In his Disputationes, which were partly published during his
          lifetime, partly after his death, and which included the entire
          department of theology, as well as in some discourses and other
          writings, Arminius had clearly and pointedly defined his
          position and expressed his conviction. On the whole these
          writings are a fine testimony to his learning and acumen. The
          doctrine of predestination belonged to the fundamental teachings
          of the Reformed Church; but the conception of it asserted by
          Calvin and his adherents, Arminius could not make his own. He
          would not follow a doctrinal development which made God the
          author of sin and of the condemnation of men. He taught
          conditional predestination and attached more importance to
          faith. He denied neither God's omnipotence nor his free grace,
          but he thought it his duty to save the honor of God, and to
          emphasize, on the basis of the clear expressions of the Bible,
          the free will of man as well as the truth of the doctrine of
          sin. In these things he was more on the side of Luther than of
          Calvin and Beza, but it cannot be denied that he expressed other
          opinions which were violently controverted as departures from
          the confession and catechism. His followers expressed their
          convictions in the famous five articles which they laid before
          the States as their justification. Called Remonstrants from
          these Remonstrantiæ, they always refused to be called Arminians.

          H. C. Rogge.

          Arminianism in its later development has entered widely into the
          thought of the Church, both on the Continent, in Great Britain,
          and in America. It was welcomed in the Lutheran Church as a
          relief from the teachings of Augustine and the Reformed
          Churches. In Holland it became allied with the more liberal
          tendencies,--Socinian, rationalistic, universalistic,--thus
          withdrawing itself from the traditional interpretation of
          Christianity. The number of its professed adherents in that
          country (most of them in Amsterdam) is not large (see
          [584]Remonstrants). In England also it developed a strong
          affinity with Socinianism in its doctrine of God and the person
          of Christ, and with Pelagianism in its conception of human
          nature. About the time of the Restoration, according to Hallam
          (Literary History of Europe, ii., London, 1855, p.131), the
          Arminians were called Latitude-men or [585]Latitudinarians and
          were addicted to Greek philosophy and natural religion. During
          the eighteenth century Arminianism was advocated by many of the
          leading writers of Great Britain,--Tillotson, Jeremy Taylor,
          Chillingworth, Burnet; by Hoadly, a Socinian; and by Whitby,
          John Taylor; and Samuel Clarke, Arians. With many others it was
          rather a repudiation of Calvinism than a definitely formed
          theory. In America Arminianism showed itself now as an advocacy
          of freedom of thought and thus of toleration; now as emphasis on
          natural human duties rather than on speculative theology; now as
          silent, now as outspoken protest against the tenets of
          Calvinism. Owing to the writings of Whitby, John Taylor, and
          Samuel Clarke, its influence greatly increased in the eighteenth
          century. To Jonathan Edwards its menace formed the motive for
          his greatest work, The Freedom of the Will. The name itself was
          made to cover many things for which Arminianism proper was not
          responsible--rationalistic tendencies of thought, depreciation
          of the serious nature of sin, indifference to vital piety, and
          laxity of morals. Arminianism became more a condition than a
          theory. In spite of opposition, however, in part on account of
          its later profound spirit through Wesley, and in part by virtue
          of its essential truth, it has thoroughly leavened the Christian
          thought of America. A sign of the times is, that theological
          schools confessedly Arminian educate young men for Churches
          which are traditionally Calvinistic, and ministers holding
          Arminian views are received by such Churches as thoroughly
          "orthodox."

   Arnaud, Henri
          ARNAUD, ??r´´nO´, HENRI: Waldensian; b. at Embrun (58 m. s.e. of
          Grenoble), Department of Hautes Alpes, France, Sept. 30, 1641;
          d. at Schönenberg near Dürrmenz (19 m. n.w by w. of Stuttgart),
          Württemberg, Sept. 8, 1721. He studied at Basel, probably
          visited Holland, and continued his studies at Geneva; became
          pastor at Maneille in the valley of St. Martin, 1670, and later
          at an unknown place in Dauphné; fled to La Torre, Piedmont,
          probably shortly after the revocation of the Edict of Nantes
          (October, 1685). He counseled resistance to the persecution of
          the Waldensians undertaken by Victor Amadeus II., Duke of Savoy,
          at the instigation of Louis XIV of France, and, when this
          failed, with the remnant of his people (about 3,000 in number)
          took refuge in Switzerland. There he was active in plotting for
          a return, and in August, 1689, he led about 900 of the exiles
          back to their old homes, where they maintained themselves
          against the French and Savoyard troops until political
          conditions (the influence of William of Orange and a breach with
          France) led the Duke to withdraw his opposition (1690). In the
          ensuing war with France he rendered good service to the duke,
          but resumed his spiritual duties in 1692. In 1698, on the
          renewal of persecution following a fresh alliance with France,
          he again went into exile in Switzerland, visited Germany,
          Holland, and England in the interest of his people, and in 1699
          settled in Württemberg as pastor of the Waldensians living in
          and about Dürrmenz. He wrote Histoire de la glorieuse rentrée
          des Vaudois dans leur vallées (Cassel, 1710; later eds.,
          Neuchâtel, 1845, Geneva, 1879; Eng. transl by H. D. Acland,

   Arnauld
          ARNAULD: The name of a famous French family, known especially
          for their connection with Jansenism The well-known lawyer
          Antoine Arnauld (1560-1619) foreshadowed the position of his
          children by defending the University of Paris against the
          Jesuits in 1594. Of his twenty children, ten died young; and
          nine of the others devoted themselves to religion. The most
          noteworthy are: The eldest, Robert Arnauld (d'Andilly; b. in
          Paris 1588; d. there Sept. 27, 1674), who held various positions
          in the government and at the court, but retired in 1640 to Port
          Royal and devoted himself to church history. He is best known by
          his translations into French, especially of Josephus and St.
          Augustine's "Confessions," and the Vies des saints pères du
          désert (2 vols., Paris, 1647-53; Eng. transl., 2 vols., London,
          1757)--Jacqueline Marie Arnauld (known in religion as Marie
          Angélique de Ste. Madeleine; b. in Paris Sept. 8, 1591; d. Aug.
          6, 1661) entered the abbey of Port Royal when only seven, and
          became abbess at eleven. Aroused to fervent devotion in 1609,
          she began a strict reformation of her abbey according to the
          Cistercian rule. She resigned the position of abbess in 1630 and
          introduced the custom of triennial elections. From 1626 to 1648
          she was in Paris, at the new house known as Port-Royal de
          Paris.--Henri Arnauld (b. in Paris 1597; d. at Angers June 8,
          1692) was at first a lawyer, but entered the priesthood, was
          elected bishop of Toul but declined the election since it had
          occasioned disputes, and became bishop of Angers in 1649. He was
          an earnest and zealous diocesan, and a decided Jansenist; he was
          one of the four bishops who refused to subscribe the bull
          Unigenitus, which condemned the Augustinus of Jansen. His
          Négociations à la cour de Rome et en différentes cours d'Italie
          was published after his death (5 vols., Paris, 1748).--Antoine
          Arnauld (b. in Paris Feb. 6, 1612; d. in Brussels Aug. 8, 1694),
          known as "the great Arnauld," like his brother Henri, studied
          law at first, but entered the Sorbonne in 1634, taking his
          doctor's degree and being ordained priest in 1641. In 1643 he
          published his work De la fréquente communion, written under St.
          Cyran's influence (see [587]Du Vergier de Hauranne, Jean), with
          which he began a lifelong struggle against the Jesuits. Its cold
          and rigid severity was opposed to their system, and they
          attacked it bitterly. Arnauld carried the war into the enemy's
          country with his Théologie morale des Jésuites (n.p., 1643),
          and, though for thirty years from 1648 he lived in retirement at
          Port Royal, his pen was never idle. He defended the cause of
          Jansen, maintaining in his two famous letters to the Duc de
          Liancourt (1655) that the five condemned propositions were not
          found in the Augustinus. The Sorbonne condemned these write, and
          in 1656 expelled him, with sixty other doctors who refused to
          submit to the decision, from its fellowship. He was obliged to
          go into hiding for a time, and, with Nicole, was sheltered by
          the Duchess de Longueville. But he was still, as he had been
          since the death of Saint Cyran (1643), the active head of the
          Jansenist party, working diligently to confirm the nuns of Port
          Royal in their opposition to the papal decrees, supplying Pascal
          with the material for his "Provincial Letters," and publishing
          numerous pamphlets and treatises against the Jesuits. When the
          "Peace of Clement IX." put a temporary end to the strife,
          Arnauld was able to turn his weapons against the Protestants,
          notably in the controversy with Claude on the Lord's Supper,
          which produced his Perpétuité de la foi de l'église catholique
          touchant l'Eucharistie (Paris, 1664). He still, however,
          continued to attack the Jesuits, and his defense of the
          "Gallican liberties" against the king in the controversy over
          the Droit de régale (see [588]Regale) brought him into such
          disfavor with the government that in 1679 he again went into
          hiding and soon after left France for Brussels, where the
          Spanish governor protected him. Here he wrote two works of
          special interest to English-speaking people, the Apologie pour
          les catholiques (2 vols., Liége, 1681-82), a defense of the
          English Roman Catholics against the charge of conspiracy,
          especially as brought by Titus Oates, and an attack on William
          of Orange (1689). Of more general interest is his controversy
          with Malebranche, which produced the Traité des vraies et des
          fausses idées (Cologne, 1683) and Réflexions philosophiques et
          théologiques sur Ie nouveau système de la nature et de la grâce
          du Père Malebranche (3 vols., 1685-86). During this period he
          collaborated with Quesnel in his translation of the New
          Testament, as he had previously with Nicole and other members of
          the Port Royal group in their educational works, especially the
          often-reprinted "Logic." He was a man of wide learning, acute
          penetration, eloquent style, and untiring diligence, but
          unbendingly obstinate and set in his own ideas, so that at Port
          Royal it was a rule never to contradict him, lest he should be
          unduly excited. His works were published at Lausanne (48 vols.,
          1775-83).-- Angélique (de Saint Jean) Arnauld, daughter of
          Robert (b. in Paris Nov. 24,1624; d. Jan. 29,1684), entered the
          abbey of Port Royal in her nineteenth year under her aunt's
          training; became subprioress in 1653 and abbess in 1678. Her
          firmness of character, and undaunted courage made her the
          principal support of the nuns during the long and grievous
          persecution brought upon them by their adherence to Jansenist
          opinions. Of several works which she wrote, the most important
          is the Mémoires pour servir à l'histoire de Port Royal (3 vols.,
          Utrecht, 1742).--For all the members of the Arnauld family see

   Arndt, Johann
          ARNDT, ??rnt, JOHANN: German mystic; b. at Edderitz, near
          Ballenstedt (36 m. s.w. of Magdeburg), Anhalt, Dec. 27, 1555; d.
          at Celle (23 m. n. of Hanover), Hanover, May 11, 1621. He
          studied theology at Helmstedt, Wittenberg, Strasburg, and Basel
          and in 1583 became pastor at Badeborn in Anhalt. He was removed
          in 1590 by Duke Johann Georg because of his refusal to submit to
          the duke's order proscribing the use of images and the practise
          of exorcism. Summoned to Quedlinburg in the same year Arndt had
          to contend with the malice of a faction among the townspeople
          with whom his aggressive preaching found little favor, and in
          1599 he followed a call to Brunswick. Here too, after some years
          of quiet, he came into conflict with his colleagues, largely
          because of the general opposition aroused by the appearance, in
          1606, of the first part of his Von wahren Christenthum. In 1609
          he became pastor at Eisleben, but two years later received the
          important post of general superintendent at Celle and in this
          position remained till his death, exercising a lasting and
          beneficent influence on the constitution of the Lüneburg church
          system. In 1609 appeared three additional books of the Wahre
          Christenthum and in 1612 he published his no less famous
          Paradiesgärtlein aller christlichen Tugenden. The appearance of
          the Wahre Christenthum gave rise to a violent controversy.
          Steeped in the mysticism of the Middle Ages, Arndt asserted the
          insufficiency of orthodox doctrine toward the complete
          attainment of the true Christian life, and upheld the necessity
          of a moral purification made possible by righteous living and by
          bringing the soul into communion with God. Though he held fast,
          formally, to the doctrine of the Lutheran Church, he
          nevertheless became thus the great precursor of Pietism and his
          is the greatest name in the history of German mysticism after
          Thomas a Kempis. The first book of the Wahre Christenthum was
          translated into English in 1646, and complete translations were
          made by A. W Boehm in 1712 and by W. Jaques in 1815. An American
          edition appeared at Philadelphia in 1842, revised in 1868. The
          Garden of Paradise appeared in English in 1716.

   Arndt, Johann Friedrich Wilhelm
          ARNDT, JOHANN FRIEDRICH WILHELM: German Lutheran; b. at Berlin
          June 24, 1802; d. there May 8, 1881. He began his theological
          studies at the University of Berlin in 1820, and in 1829 became
          assistant minister to the bishop of the province of Saxony. His
          sermons delivered in the cathedral of Magdeburg attracted large
          audiences and his influence was especially marked among the
          higher classes and the learned. Called to Berlin in 1833 as
          associate pastor, he succeeded to the office of head preacher in
          1840, retiring in 1875 because of his dissatisfaction with the
          reorganization of the church system effected two years
          previously. During his long pastorate at Berlin, Arndt
          established his reputation as one of the most eloquent pulpit
          orators of his time, and his volumes of sermons, frequently
          issued, constituted highly important contributions to German
          homiletic literature. As at Magdeburg, his congregation included
          persons of great eminence, among them such theologians as
          Neander and Hengstenberg. Arndt's remarkable power in the pulpit
          consisted in an exceptional gift for psychological analysis and
          shrewd observation and an extremely forcible style. He did not,
          however, escape the danger of dogmatism, and doctrine and
          formulas constituted for him an important part of the Christian
          life. His thought shows little development throughout his long
          career and the attitude revealed in his earliest works is the
          same found in his later sermons. Of the numerous collections of
          these mention may be made of Das christliche Leben (Magdeburg,
          1834); Predigten über Davidis Leben (1836); Das Vaterunser
          (1837); Die Bergpredigt Jesu Christi (1838). He also wrote Das
          Leben Jesu Christi (1850-55), and Die gottesdienstlichen
          Handlungen der evangelischen Kirche (1860).

   Arno of Reichersberg
          ARNO OF REICHERSBERG: A younger brother of the more famous
          Gerhoh of Reichersberg; d. Jan. 30, 1175. The year of his birth
          is not known, He received his education from Gerhoh, whose "son
          in the Lord" he calls himself. A third brother, Ruodger, was
          dean at Augsburg, and later at Neuburg. After Gerhoh's death,
          Arno, then dean, was unanimously chosen provost of the
          collegiate church of Reichersberg on the Inn, in the diocese of
          Passau (June 29, 1169). He wrote his Scutum canonicorum (in MPL,
          cxciv. 1489-1528) under Eugenius III., and so earlier than 1153.
          It was called out by the jealousy existing between the monks and
          the canons, which Arno wholly condemns, pleading for fraternal
          unity between the two foundations with similar aims. At the same
          time he vigorously defends the canons' rule of life, considering
          them the true imitators of Christ and the apostles, especially
          because, unlike the monks, they occupy themselves directly with
          the service of their neighbors. He also wrote an apologetic
          treatise (ed. C. Weichert, Leipsic, 1888), defending the
          teaching of Gerhoh against Provost Folmar of Triefenstein, on a
          question of Christology--whether the man (homo) taken into God
          at the Incarnation is truly and strictly the Son of God. Arno
          vehemently asserts the affirmative, maintaining that all the
          qualities of the Godhead were communicated to the human nature,
          though veiled during the earthly life of Christ. As a corollary
          he condemns the prevailing view of a local heaven, in which
          Christ sits in bodily presence. Underneath his polemic against
          Folmar there is another, expressed or unexpressed, against a
          more important theologian, Peter Lombard; and in one place he
          also controverts Hugo of St. Victor. Among other contemporary
          theologians, he knows Bernard of Clairvaux and Rupert of Deutz.

   Arno of Salzburg
          ARNO OF SALZBURG: Archbishop of Salzburg 785-821. He seems to
          have been born in the diocese of Freising, where his name occurs
          in the records as deacon and as priest down to 776. After 782 he
          is found as abbot at St. Amand at Elnon in Hainault, which he
          retained even after his consecration as bishop of Salzburg, June
          10, 785. He was sent to Rome in 787 to implore the help of the
          pope in reconciling Charlemagne with Tassilo, Duke of Bavaria,
          but failed, and Bavaria lost its independence the following
          year. Arno gained the confidence of the new ruler, however, and
          Charlemagne confirmed the church of Salzburg in its possessions
          (790). The bishop was employed as missus dominicus in Bavaria;
          and at the close of the war with the Avars, all the conquered
          lands were placed under the spiritual authority of Salzburg.
          When Pope Leo III. was driven out by the kinsmen of his
          predecessor, Arno was charged by Charlemagne with the task of
          restoring peace and order in Rome, and explaining to the pope
          the king's wishes for the settlement of ecclesiastical affairs
          in the eastern part of his realm (797). In deference to these
          wishes, Bavaria was included ecclesiastically as well as civilly
          in the Frankish kingdom, and Salzburg was raised to the dignity
          of a metropolitan see, Arno receiving the pallium April 20, 798.
          He visited Rome again in 799 to restore Leo III. once more, and
          in 800 for the coronation of Charlemagne. He was missus
          dominicus in Bavaria almost continuously from 802 to 806; he
          appears on the occasion of Charlemagne's making his will, and at
          the Council of Mainz in 813, after which he seems to have
          retired from public life. He was a friend of learning and art,
          and is said to have had more than 150 books copied.

   Arnobius
          ARNOBIUS, ar-nO´bi-us: A teacher of rhetoric at Sicca in
          proconsular Africa under Diocletian. At first he was a fierce
          opponent of Christianity, but he was converted and wrote seven
          books adversus nationes, in which he seeks to refute the charge
          of his contemporaries that Christianity was the cause of all
          misery in the world. To this point he devotes books i. and ii.
          The other books are a polemic against heathenism, showing in
          iii., iv., and v. the folly and immorality of the polytheistic
          mythology, while vi. and vii. speak of the heathen temple and
          sacrificial service. When the work was composed can not be
          stated exactly, but probably it was after 303. Arnobius was
          neither a clear thinker, nor a skilful writer (cf. Jerome,
          Epist., lviii. 10). Where he tries to pose as philosopher, he
          betrays no deep study. His ideas conflict not seldom with Holy
          Scripture. Greek mythology he knows only from the "Preceptor" of
          Clement of Alexandria, and Roman mythology from the writings of
          Cornelius Labeo, whom he sometimes attacks. He had only a
          superficial knowledge of Christianity. His naive modalism is
          merely the expression of a very superstitious sentiment, and his
          notions concerning the origin, nature, and continuance of the
          soul have anything but a Christian-ecclesiastical color.

   Arnold of Brescia

  ARNOLD OF BRESCIA

          Life to 1139 (§ 1)

          Banished from Italy (§ 2)

          Political Activity in Rome (§ 3)

          Condemnation and Death (§ 4)

          Arnold of Brescia, church reformer of the twelfth century, was
          born at Brescia, but the year is not known; he was executed at
          Rome 1155.

    Life to 1139.

          At an early age he devoted himself to the priesthood. Like many
          young Italians of his time he studied in France and became a
          pupil of Abelard. His scientific culture is particularly
          praised, and Abelard's keen criticism of tradition helped no
          doubt to loosen the bonds which connected Arnold with the
          existing church authority. Some years later he appears again in
          his native city, having meanwhile been ordained priest. The
          Historia pontificalis calls him canonicus regularis and abbas
          apud Brixiam. The views to which he clung to his death were
          already fixed in his mind. The Church must resign worldly power
          and worldly possessions; priests, having worldly possessions,
          forfeit salvation; their necessary support they must obtain from
          the tithes, and the laity, who withheld from the priests what
          belonged to them, come in for a share of Arnold's criticism. His
          austere asceticism and powerful eloquence gained him great
          authority, which rendered his opposition formidable to Manfred,
          bishop of Brescia, and the latter accused him at a synod held in
          Rome in 1139. Arnold was banished from Italy and had to vow
          solemnly not to return without papal permission.

    2. Banished from Italy.

          A revolution now took place in Brescia, and the "evil-minded
          consuls, hypocritical and heretical men" , were expelled from
          the city by the knighthood. Arnold meanwhile had gone to France,
          where he assisted Abelard against Bernard of Clairvaux, and so
          the condemnation passed by Innocent II. in 1140 on Abelard
          concerned him likewise; they were to be separated and kept in
          monastic prisons. Arnold, however, remained unmolested for the
          time being, because of a conflict between the king and the
          curia. Bernard was at first against the king, but afterward he
          acted as mediator, and thus after a short time Arnold had to
          leave France. He went to Zurich, where he soon had a following.
          A letter of Bernard (cxcv.) to Bishop Herman of Constance
          [written 1140] caused his expulsion, but he soon found a safe
          refuge, for another letter of Bernard's (cxcvi.) to Cardinal
          Guido--probably the cardinal deacon Guido who was active as
          papal legate in Bohemia and Moravia between 1142 and
          1145--received Arnold into his retinue and honored him with his
          society. Arnold returned to Italy shortly after the death of
          Innocent (1143), and Eugenius III. (1145-53) received the
          fugitive again into the communion of the Church after a promise
          to do penance.

    3. Political Activity in Rome.

          Rome was at that time the theater of great struggles. Toward the
          end of the life of Innocent II. the community had created a
          senate and appointed a patrician in place of the city-prefect
          dependent on the pope. Eugenius escaped these unpleasant
          relations by going to France, and Arnold developed great public
          activity. He attacked the cardinals, and even the pope. A new
          element now comes out in him according to the Historia
          pontificalis, which makes him say that those should not be
          tolerated who wish to enslave Rome, the mistress of the world,
          the source of liberty. He took up the idea of reclaiming for
          Rome her ancient powerful position in the world. He entered into
          close relations with the Roman community which had become a
          republic and had promised to protect him against every one.
          Eugenius sought to get possession of Rome by force of arms, and
          in their distress the Romans looked to King Conrad, who,
          however, had no thought of realizing their hopes, though he was
          is no position to help the pope in an effective manner. An
          agreement was made in November, 1149, according to which Rome
          acknowledged the supremacy of the pope, but the government of
          the city remained in the hands of the senate. Arnold exercised
          his influence as before. When Frederick I. became ruler,
          Eugenius obtained his promise of a campaign against Rome. But
          the Arnoldists also applied to him in a writing, the strange
          contents of which may be regarded as an echo of Arnolds sermons.
          It declares that clerics who in spite of the gospel and the
          canonical rules claimed for themselves the right of confirming
          the emperor are successors of Julian the Apostate; the Donation
          of Constantine is a heretical fable, which even the everyday
          Roman ridicules; as the empire belongs to the Romans, who should
          hinder them from electing a new emperor? It is possible that
          such eccentric schemes repelled the more prudent elements. At
          the elections of November 1, 1152, the Arnoldists seem to have
          been defeated, for the senate is soon found in negotiation with
          the pope, and he was enabled to make his entrance in December. A
          little later Frederick promised to subdue the Romans.

    4. Condemnation and Death.

          When Adrian IV ascended the papal throne December 5, 1154, he
          demanded of the senate the expulsion of Arnold, which for the
          time being was not heeded. But an attack made upon a cardinal
          gave opportunity, shortly before palm Sunday, 1155, to pronounce
          an interdict on Rome,--a hitherto unheard-of proceeding. The
          depression which already existed in the city was enhanced by
          this measure, and on Wednesday the senate appeared before the
          pope and obtained the removal of the interdict by swearing to
          expel Arnold and his adherents. Arnold's fate was now decided.
          Banished from Rome, he found indeed a refuge with the viscounts
          of Campagnatico, but, urged by the pope, Frederick induced them
          to hand him over to Adrian. The city-prefect, as Rome's criminal
          judge, delivered him to the gallows, had his body burned, and
          the ashes thrown into the Tiber. He died lamented even by men
          who, like Gerhoh of Reichersberg, by no means agreed with him.
          The great cause of his death was no doubt his opposition to the
          worldly power of the pope. But he was also regarded as a
          heretic. That he held false doctrines regarding baptism has not
          been substantiated; but he declared that the sacraments
          administered by priests not leading an apostolic life were
          invalid, and herein one could see a rejection of the official
          Church and hence a heresy. That Arnold left many followers is
          evident from the Historia pontificalis, and in the great bull of
          excommunication of Lucius III. (1184), Arnoldists are mentioned.
          Thenceforth only isolated notices concerning them are found;
          they were probably lost among the Waldensians.

          ARNOLD, CARL FRANKLIN: German Lutheran; b. at Williamafield, O.,
          Mar. 10, 1853. He was educated at the gymnasium at Bremen and
          the universities of Erlangen, Leipsic, and Königsberg (Ph.D.,
          1882). He was instructor in religion at the Wilhelms-Gymnasium
          in Königsberg from 1878 to 1888, when he was appointed professor
          of church history in the University of Breslau. Since 1898 he
          has also been ephorus of the Gräfliches Ledemtzky'sches
          Johanneum. In theology he is an advocate of positive union. He
          has written Studien zur Geschichte der plinianischen
          Christenverfolgung (Königsberg, 1887); Die neronische
          Christenverfolgung (Leipsic, 1888); Auswahl aus J. G. Hamanns

   Arnold, Gottfried
          ARNOLD, GOTTFRIED: Lutheran; b. at Annaberg (18 m. s. of
          Chemnitz), Saxony, Sept. 5, 1688; d. at Perleberg (75 m. n.w. of
          Berlin), Prussia, May 30, 1714. In 1685 he began the study of
          theology at Wittenberg but gave himself up to independent
          reading in early church history. Through the influence of
          Spener, then court preacher at Dresden, he became tutor in a
          noble family of that city in 1689, and later obtained a similar
          position at Quedlinburg. There be became identified with the
          most prominent exponents of mystic and separatist teachings and
          in 1696 published Die erste Liebe (ed. A. C. Lämmert, Stuttgart,
          1844), a eulogy on the early Christian Church in which his
          hostility to dogma and ecclesiasticism led him to exalt the
          virtues of the primitive Church as opposed to the formulism of
          later orthodoxy. In 1697 he became professor of history at
          Giessen, but found himself out of sympathy with the practical
          nature of his duties and returned in the following year to
          Quedlinburg. In 1699-1700 he published his Unparteiische
          Kirchen- und Ketzer-Historie (4 vols.; new ed., Frankfort,
          1729), which had a marked influence on church history. In
          studying heretical movements Arnold refused to accept as
          authority the evidence of hostile contemporaries and draw upon
          the writings of the sectaries themselves for his materials. In
          view of his constitutional opposition to orthodox doctrine this
          method naturally led to his assuming a position extremely
          favorable to the separatists of various ages and occasioned a
          vigorous controversy which plunged him deeper still into
          mysticism. From this period date his beautiful religious songs,
          of which a number have found a place in the evangelical hymnal.
          In 1704 he became pastor and inspector at Werben, in Prussia,
          and from that time may be dated his reconciliation with
          established theology. In 1707 he became inspector at Perleberg,
          bringing to the performance of his duties the utmost devotion
          and energy. Besides his church history, his writings number more
          than fifty, among them, Geistliche Gestalt eines evangelischen
          Lehrers (Halle, 1704) and Wahre Abbildung des inwendigen
          Christenthums (Frankfort, 1709). His hymns were edited by K. C.
          E. Ehmann (Stuttgart, 1856).

          ARNOLD, MATTHEW: Church of England; b. at Laleham, near Chertsey
          (32 m. w.s.w. of London), Dec. 24, 1822, eldest son of
          [593]Thomas Arnold (q.v.); d. in Liverpool Apr. 15, 1888. He
          studied at Winchester and Rugby schools, and at Balliol College,
          Oxford, and became fellow of Oriel 1845. In 1847 he became
          private secretary to the Marquis of Lansdowne, then president of
          the council and acting as minister of public instruction; by his
          influence was appointed in 1851 as inspector of schools, and
          held the position till 1886. He was professor of poetry at
          Oxford 1857-67. He was a zealous and able official and his
          reports upon continental schools, which he visited frequently,
          are valuable in educational literature. His poetry is of high
          rank; and as literary critic he was unrivaled in his generation.
          He possessed a subtle mind, a keen critical spirit, and a
          passionate love of truth, which, when applied to religious
          problems, found many defects is the current theology of the
          time; the chief being a disposition to rest on unprovable
          assumptions and to ignore the claims of reason. The greatest
          good he held to be progress toward perfection; and such progress
          could only be made by culture,'which meet acquaintance with the
          best that has been done and thought in the world. He declared
          that oonduct is three-fourths of life,'characterised religion as
          morality touched with emotion,'originated the phrase the
          enduring power, not ourselves, which makes for
          righteousness,'and believed that miracles do not happen.'His
          works which bear on religious topics are: Culture and Anarchy
          (London, 1869); St. Paul and Protestantism: with an introduction
          on Puritanism, and the Church of England (1870); Literature and
          Dogma, an essay toward a better appreciation of the Bible
          (1873); God and the Bible, a review of objections to Literature
          and Dogma'(1875); Last Essays on Church and Religion (1877). He
          also edited, with prefaces and notes, the two sections of the
          Book of Isaiah, A Bible-Reading for Schools, the great prophecy
          of Israel's Restoration [Isaiah xl.-lxvi.] (1872; new ed.,
          1875); Isaiah of Jerusalem [Isaiah i.-xxxix.] (1883). A complete
          edition of his works in 15 volumes was issued in London and New
          York, 1903-04. In accordance with his wish no authorised
          biography has been published, but his Letters, 1848-88
          (collected and arranged by G. W. E. Russell, 2 vols., London,
          1895) furnish an excellent substitute.

          Oct. 15, 1680. He studied under Amos Comenius, at Danzog
          (1635-41), and at Franeker, where Maccovius and Cocceius were
          his teachers. After visiting the academies of Groningen, Leyden,
          and Utrecht, and traveling in England, he was appointed minister
          at Beetgum, near Leeuwarden, Friesland, in 1645, and professor
          of theology at Franeker in 1651. He edited the works of
          Maccovius, and published, against Socinianism, Religio Sociniana

          1842. He studied at Warminster and Winchester schools and Corpus
          Christi College, Oxford, becoming a fellow of Oriel in 1815. He
          was ordained deacon in 1818, and in 1819 settled at Laleham, on
          the Thames near Staines, where he undertook to prepare a small
          number of young men for the universities. In 1828 he was
          ordained priest and appointed head master of Rugby; in 1841 be
          was made regius professor of modern history at Oxford, but
          delivered only one course of lectures. He is best known as one
          of the greatest of English schoolteachers; but he should be
          remembered no less as a keen-thinking and sharp-sighted leader
          of religious thought. Like Newman, Keble, and others of the
          reactionary High-church party, he was alarmed by the troubles
          political and otherwise, which appeared to be threatening the
          Church. But he sought safety by advocating that its doors should
          be opened so that all English Christians could find room within
          it. Differences of doctrine, constitution, and ritual he
          maintained were minor matters and should be disregarded; the
          essential thing in Christianity is practical godliness,
          manifesting itself in individual and social life. Church and
          State alike exist to help realise this ideal and each needs the
          other. [5] His views were expressed in two pamphlets, The
          Principles of Church Reform (London, 1833) and Fragment on the
          Church (1844); his religious writings also include six volumes
          of Sermons. His historical works comprise an edition of
          Thucydides (3 vols., 1830-35); the History of Rome (3 vols.,
          1838-43, unfinished); History of the Later Roman Commonwealth (2
          vols., 1845); Lectures on Modern History (Oxford, 1842).

   Arnoldi, Bartholomæus
          ARNOLDI (ar-nel´dî), BARTHOLOMÆUS (Bartholomew of Usingen): The
          teacher and later the opponent of Luther; b. at Usingen (17 m.
          n.n.w. of Frankfort) about 1464; d. at Würzburg Sept. 9, 1532.
          He entered the University of Erfurt probably in 1484, and was
          made master of arts in 1491. As teacher of philosophy and by his
          widely circulated writings he won the high esteem of both his
          colleagues and his pupils, among whom Luther seems to have been
          specially in close relations with him. When nearly fifty, and
          apparently in part owing to Luther's influence, he entered the
          Augustinian order, and later became professor of theology in the
          studium generale of the order at Erfurt. He was opposed to the
          later exaggerations of the scholastic methods, but without going
          as far in this direction as Luther, in whose rejection of
          philosophy he saw one of the sources of what he considered the
          reformer's later errors. He took a decided stand against the
          Wittenberg theses; after he had been deserted by his brethren of
          the Erfurt house he attacked the reforming movement in his first
          controversial treatise (1522), directed against the fiery
          preaching of Cuelsamer and Mechler. This was followed by many
          others covering the whole range of the controversy, and becoming
          more and more bitter as his old pupils scorned his exhortations.
          He was finally obliged to leave Erfurt, and in 1526 is found in
          the Augustinian house at Würzburg. He was not a great theologian
          nor even a good Latinist; but he seems to have been an honorable
          man who made a thorough study of his opponents' writings and
          learned to fight them with their own weapons. At Würzburg he was
          of great assistance to his bishop, Conrad von Thüngen, in the
          struggle with growing Protestantism, appeared with him at the
          Diet of Augsburg, and was among the theologians to whom the
          refutation of the Confession was committed.

          MGH, Script., vi., 1844, p. 324) 640. He early distinguished
          himself in deeds of arms and affairs of state, but later devoted
          himself to an ecclesiastical career, and in 611 or 612 was made
          bishop of Metz. In this position he exercised considerable
          influence on the government of the Frankish kingdom, as a friend
          of Pepin of Landen, and enjoying the confidence of the
          Austrasian magnates. It was to him more than to any other that
          Clothair II. of Neustria owed his attainment of the dominion of
          Austrasia. Arnulf had been married as a young man, and through
          his son Ansegis, who married Pepin's daughter Begga, he became
          the ancestor of the Carolingian house. Amid all his dignities,
          he longed for the peace of the contemplative life; probably in
          627 he resigned his see and retired into the wilderness of the
          Vosges, where he lived as a hermit near his friend Romarich, the
          founder of the abbey of Remiremont. His body rests in the church
          at Metz which bears his name.

          ARROWSMITH, JOHN: Puritan and Presbyterian; b. near
          Newcastle-on-Tyne Mar. 29, 1602; d. at Cambridge and was buried
          Feb. 24, 1659. He was educated at Cambridge, where he became
          fellow of St. Catherine's Hall (1623). He was successively
          incumbent of St. Nicholas's Chapel, King's Lynn (1631); master
          of St. John's College, Cambridge (1644); rector of St. Martin's,
          Ironmonger Lane, London (1645), and member of the sixth London
          classis; vice-chancellor of Cambridge University (1647); regius
          professor of divinity there (1651); master of Trinity College
          (1653). He sat in the Westminster Assembly of Divines (1643).
          Robert Baillie describes him as "a man with a glass eye in place
          of that which was put out by an arrow, a learned divine, on whom
          the Assembly put the writing against the Antinomians." He was on
          the committee to draw up a confession of faith, and preached
          thrice before Parliament, the sermons being published: The
          Covenant-Avenging Sword Brandished [Lev. xxvi. 25] (London,
          1643, 4to, pp. 28); England's Eben-ezer [I Sam. vii. 12] (1645,

          the Militant Church, drawn by a Divine Penman [Rev. xii. 1, 2]
          (1647, 4to, pp. 44). While at Cambridge he published Tactica
          sacra, sive de milite spirituali pugnante, vincente, et
          triumphante dissertatio (Cambridge, 1657, 4to, pp. 363),
          containing also three Orationes anti-Weigelianæ. After his death
          there were published: Armilla catechetica, A Chain of
          Principles; or, an orderly Concatenation of Theological
          Aphorisms and Exercitations, wherein the chief Heads of
          Christian Religion are asserted and improved (Cambridge, 1659,
          4to, pp. 490), an unfinished work designed to form a complete
          body of divinity in thirty aphorisms, only six of which were
          completed, covering for the most part the ground of the first
          twenty questions of the larger Westminster Catechism, in
          essentially the same order; also theanthropos or God-Man
          (London, 1660, 4to, pp. 311), an exposition of the Gospel of
          John i. 1-18, discussing the divinity and humanity of Christ,
          and maintaining the Catholic doctrine against all heresies.

   Art and the Church

  ART AND CHURCH.

          Art is the Early Church (§ 1).

          The Romanesque and Medieval Periods (§ 2).

          The Renaissance (§ 3).

          Since the Reformation (§ 4).

    1. Art in the Early Church.

          There is nothing in the nature of Christianity which excludes
          art, although in the Apostolic Age, under the prevalence of the
          purely religious contemplation of life and life's problems, the
          knowledge and cultivation of it naturally receded. But when
          Christianity entered into the world of Greco-Roman culture, it
          soon became evident that it had great receptivity for art. If
          the Church allowed artistic decoration in the solemn resting
          places of the dead, the catacombs, as early as the end of the
          first century, the conclusion is justified that art had also a
          place in the house of worship. Herein the fundamental position
          of the Church is clearly expressed; and the steady growth of
          artistic activity during the second and third centuries
          indicates not only a tacit permission, but even an active
          promotion on the part of the Church, though no definite
          statement to that effect is found. Nevertheless, some doubts
          were felt. The existing art was intimately connected with the
          cult of the gods and was thus defiled by heathenism. With this
          in mind, and knowing that Christian artists manufactured idols,
          Tertullian attributed to the devil the introduction into the
          world of artificers of statues and likenesses (De idolo latria,
          iii.). But herein he does not touch upon the fundamental
          question, having in mind only art stained by idolatry. Clement
          of Alexandria is of much the same opinion, yet he adds "let art
          receive its meed of praise, but let it not deceive man by
          passing itself off for truth" (Protreptikos, iv.). The judgment
          of both Tertullian and Clement was warped by the ascetic ideal.
          Again the Old Testament prohibition of likenesses of living
          things had influence, and prevented all portraiture of God in
          human form till the second half of the fourth century. The
          Spanish synod at Elvira about 313 (see [595]Elvira, Synod of)
          declared that "pictures ought not to be in churches, nor that
          which is worshiped and adored to be depicted on the walls "
          (canon xxxvi.). The same considerations influenced Eusebius of
          Cæsarea, as may be seen from his letter to the empress
          Constantia; and, to a still greater degree, Epiphanius, who tore
          down a curtain adorned with a picture in a Palestinian village
          church, because it was contrary to Holy Writ (Epist. ad Joh.
          Hieros., ix.). The fear that the masses just emancipated from
          heathenism might transfer the heathen image-worship to the
          Christian was not groundless. But the general view of the Church
          was not expressed by these voices. Men esteemed for knowledge
          and the Christian life take note of works of art (Augustine,
          Gregory of Nyssa), encourage artists (Basil the Great), or
          express pleasure in artistic creations (Gregory of Nazianzus).
          Still more explicit is the language of the monuments of art.
          From the time of Constantine ecclesiastical architecture,
          representative art, and the minor arts made rapid progress. Not
          only the houses of worship but the holy vessels, vestments, and
          the like received decoration. Even an ascetic like St. Nilus
          planned a magnificent church (cf. Augusti, ii. 88 sqq.), and
          everywhere throughout Christendom bishops were eager to build
          (cf. Schultze, 31 sqq.). There was less reason for denying the
          admissibility of art, since it was believed that more than one
          picture had originated by divine miracle (cf. E. van Dobschütz,
          Christusbilder, Leipsic, 1899) and even the evangelist Luke was
          regarded as a painter (cf. T. Zahn, Einleitung in das Neue
          Testament, ii., Leipsic, 1899, 337).

    2. The Romanesque and Medieval Periods.

          In the Carolingian. and Romanesque periods the clergy and monks
          were the creators of ecclesiastical art. The Benedictines long
          stood at the head. The Gothic also developed under church
          influence, although in it the lay element had a greater part.
          Art-loving prelates are met with throughout the entire medieval
          period (cf. Otte, ii. 24-25). In the Greek Church of the Middle
          Ages, Church and art are even more closely connected, and the
          influence of the Church was greater. The freedom of art, in so
          far as it was taken into the ecclesiastical service, was more
          limited, but the current assumption that dead formalism and
          conventionality ruled in the Byzantine Church is an error. There
          was a glorious revival in the ninth century. The iconoclastic
          controversy had a destructive influence, but its outcome is
          proof of the inseparable connection of art and Church.

    3. The Renaissance.

          The Renaissance brought a change. As it emphasized the rights of
          the individual and called for independence and personal
          responsibility, so it delivered art from ecclesiastical
          domination and tutelage. Free apprehension of nature took the
          place of the former more or less conscious dependence on
          tradition (J. Burckhardt, Die Kultur der Renaissance in Italien,
          Leipsic, 1885; idem, Geschichte der Renaissance in Italien,
          Stuttgart, 1890). In Michelangelo this freedom comes out the
          grandest. The Church itself, carried away by the powerful stream
          of the new culture, was first moved by it without reflection,
          but its true ideas characterise not so much the Renaissance
          popes, Julius II. and Leo X., as an Adrian VI. Hence the
          disenchantment which soon followed.

    4. Since the Reformation.

          With the restoration of Roman Catholicism after the convulsions
          of the Reformation, commences the renunciation of the free art
          of the Renaissance and a return to the ecclesiastical ideals of
          the Middle Ages. Romanticism strengthened this impulse by
          similar tendencies, and modem ultramontane Roman Catholicism
          carried it out to the utmost. The inability of Roman Catholic
          ethics to appreciate the phenomena of the secular life
          influences also the judgment of the Church of Rome on the
          essence and purpose of art. It regards secular art as on a lower
          level than ecclesiastical. Protestantism, on the other hand,
          continues the conception of the Renaissance. The standards of
          valuation of a work of art are not to be taken from dogmatics
          and ethics, but from the character of art itself. No fundamental
          difference between secular and religious art is recognised. With
          this the possibility of an unlimited, free relation between
          Church and art is obtained. The two branches of Protestantism
          are here in perfect agreement. They perceive in art something
          which is permitted to the Christian as the use of secular
          culture in general. But the two confessions differ in that the
          Lutheran Church not only opened its houses of worship to art but
          asserted for it therein a necessary place; whereas the Reformed
          Church, strongly influenced in its ethics, as in other respects,
          by an Old Testament legalistic view, excluded art as much as
          possible from the culture and religious service in general. From
          this Protestantism has wrongly been suspected of being an
          adversary of art. But this rigor has been somewhat weakened, or
          wholly abandoned in modern times. From the position of
          Protestantism toward art follows its perfect independence of the
          ecclesiastical tradition. Much as it demands a religious and
          ecclesiastical art, it abstains from laying down canonical
          enactments with reference to its development, while constantly
          and properly insisting that such art shall be really promotive
          of its avowed lofty purpose.

   Art, Hebrew
          ART, HEBREW: The ancient Israelites accomplished practically
          nothing in the realm of art. They lacked the necessary natural
          gifts, constructive power, and creative imagination. In the
          ancient time, when images of gods were indispensable to worship,
          their native incapacity was supplemented by no outside
          influence, and the old Israelitic images were of the rudest
          kind. After contact with more artistic neighbors had given them
          technical skill, the peculiar hostility of their religion to
          representative art prevented its development. To such an extent
          was this hostility carried that all likenesses of living
          creatures, whether human or animal, were forbidden. Such a
          prohibition--which survives in Islam to-day--was manifestly
          possible only among a people of no artistic tastes or powers; it
          is inconceivable among the Greeks. There is no mention of
          Israelitic sculpture. The complete silence concerning statues or
          stone ornamentation of any kind in Solomon's buildings indicates
          that nothing of the sort was found there. Stone sarcophagi, such
          as the Phenicians and Egyptians made, were not used. The
          maz?z?ebhoth, the cultic pillars of stone, make the nearest
          approach to statuary; but while among other nations the stone
          pillars developed into true statues of gods, among the
          Israelites they always remained mere pillars. Such an expression
          as "goodly images" in Hos. x. 1 probably indicates that
          sometimes, as among other Semitic peoples, rude forms were
          chiseled on the pillars. Wood carving seems to have been
          practised. The teraphim certainly had something like a man's
          head (I Sam. xix. 13). There were two cherubim of olive wood in
          Solomon's temple (I Kings vi. 23), and in Ezekiel's time the
          temple doors and walls were adorned with carving (Ezek. xli.
          17-26; cf. also the later additions to the description of
          Solomon's temple, I Kings vii. 18, 29, 35). Doorposts and the
          wainscoting of houses and articles of furniture, such as divans,
          tables, and chairs, were thus decorated in the time of the later
          kings. But it is noteworthy that the masterpiece of such work,
          Solomon's throne (I Kings x. 18-20), was made by Phenician
          workmen. Metal work also developed under Phenician influence.
          Solomon had to send to Tyre for an artist to do the casting
          necessary for the temple (I Kings vii. 13-46). The art of
          overlaying with metal seems to have been better understood and
          to date from an earlier time. The ephod may have been made of
          wood or clay overlaid with gold or silver (see [596]Ephod), and
          the calves of Dan and Bethel (I Kings xii. 28-29) were doubtless
          constructed in this way. A knowledge of gem cutting is ascribed
          to the time of the Exodus (Ex. xxviii. 21), and the patriarchs
          are said to have had seals (Gen. xxxviii. 18),--which proves at
          least that the art was familiar and old when the narratives were
          written. There is mention of an iron graving tool with diamond
          point (Jer. xvii. 1). Israelitic seals which have been preserved
          resemble the Phenician so closely that they can be distinguished
          only when they bear a distinctively Israelitic name (see
          [597]Dress and Ornament, Hebrew, § 6). Hebrew pottery also has
          the same form as the Phenician; some of the specimens which have
          been found may be Phenician work. They are painted with
          geometric patterns (see [598]Handicrafts, Hebrew). Manifestly
          there can be no thought of a Hebrew style in any of the
          departments described, distinct from that prevailing in Phenicia
          and all Syria, and this was not original, but borrowed from
          Assyria and Egypt.

          mentioned in Nehemiah and Ezra, where, however, the word occurs
          in the form of Artachshashta, by which is doubtless meant
          Artaxerxes I. Longimanus, 465-425 B.C. In the Persian cuneiform
          inscriptions the name is written Artakhshathra, "righteous" or
          "sublime ruler." In Ezra iv. 7, Artaxerxes Longimanus is meant,
          not the Pseudo-Smerdis; so also Ezra vii. 1, 11 where, following
          Josephus Ant., XI. v. 1, Xerxes has been read. In the twentieth
          year of Artachshashta or Artaxerxes, that is, in the year

          that he shrank from applying the name God to Jesus, and he is
          probably to be classed with the dynamistic Monarchians (see
          [600]Monarchianism); he was living at Rome, but separated from
          the Church and without influence, about 270. Paul of Samosata
          adopted and developed his views.

   Arthur, William
          ARTHUR, WILLIAM: Methodist; b. at Kells (18 m. n.w. of Belfast),
          County Antrim, Ireland, Feb. 3, 1819; d. at Cannes, France,
          March 9, 1901. He began to preach at the age of sixteen, was
          accepted as a candidate for the ministry by the Irish Conference
          in 1837, and spent the next two years as a student at the
          Theological Institution at Hoxton, London. In 1839 he went to
          India, and opened a new mission station at Gutti, Mysore, but
          returned to England in 1841, completely broken down in health.
          His eyesight, in particular, was much impaired, and from this
          affliction he never fully recovered. He was stationed at
          Boulogne, 1846, in Paris, 1847-48; preached in London, 1849-50;
          was appointed one of the secretaries of the Wesleyan Missionary
          Society, 1851; first principal of the Belfast Methodist College,
          1868; honorary missionary secretary, 1871. In 1888 he retired
          and thenceforth lived chiefly in southern France. In 1856 he was
          made a member of the legal committee of his Church, and from
          that time on was prominent in all connectional committees and
          conference proceedings. He was president of the Conference in
          1866. During the Civil War in America he championed the Union
          cause and wrote a series of able articles in its support for The
          London Quarterly Review--a periodical which he helped to found
          in 1853 and to which he contributed regularly for thirty years.
          His books are numerous and some of them had an enormous sale.
          They include: A Mission to the Mysore, with Scenes and Facts
          Illustrative of India, its People and its Religion (London,
          1847; ed., with introduction, notes, and appendix, H. Haigh,
          1902); The Successful Merchant, Sketches of the Life of Mr.
          Samuel Budgett (1852); The People's Day, an Appeal to the Right
          Hon. Lord Stanley against his Advocacy of a French Sunday
          (1855); The Tongue of Fire, or the True Power of Christianity
          (1856); Italy in Transition, Public Scenes and Private Opinions
          in the Spring of 1860 (1860); The Modern Jove, a Review of the
          Collected Speeches of Pio Nono (1873); The Life of Gideon
          Ouseley (1876); The Pope, the Kings, and the People (2 vols.,

   Arundel, Thomas
          ARUNDEL, ar´Un-dl, THOMAS: Archbishop of Canterbury; b. at
          Arundel Castle (55 m. s.w. of London), Sussex, 1353; d. at
          Canterbury Feb. 19, 1414. He was the third son of the Earl of
          Arundel, and the family influence secured his promotion to the
          bishopric of Ely when only twenty-one; he was made Archbishop of
          York in 1388, of Canterbury in 1396, this being the first
          instance of a translation from York to Canterbury. He was active
          in the turbulent times of Richard II, and incurred the
          resentment of the king; in 1397, with his brother, the Earl of
          Arundel, he was impeached of high treason; the Earl was executed
          and the Archbishop was banished. He went to Rome, but the Pope,
          Boniface IX, at the request of Richard, transferred him to St.
          Andrews which in effect deprived him of a see, as Scotland
          adhered to the rival pope, Benedict XIII. He joined Henry of
          Lancaster on the continent, returned with him to England, 1399,
          crowned him king, Oct. 13, and was reinstated as Archbishop of
          Canterbury. He was five times Lord Chancellor of England, twice
          under Richard II (1386-89 and 1391-96), and three times under
          Henry IV. Arundel was a shrewd and far-sighted prelate in the
          performance of what he understood to be his duty. He spent his
          wealth freely upon the churches in which he was interested. In
          his later years he entered heartily into the persecution of the
          Lollards and was especially conspicuous in the prosecution of
          Lord Cobham. He procured a prohibition of the vernacular
          translation of the Scriptures.

   Asa
          ASA, ê´sa: Third king of Judah, son and successor of Abijah. He
          is said to have reigned forty-one years, contemporary with
          Jeroboam, Nadab, Baasha, Elah, Zimri, Omri, and Ahab of Israel.
          His dates, according to the old chronology, are 955-914 B.C.;
          according to Hommel, 911-871; according to Duncker, 929-872;
          according to Kamphausen, 917-877. Although in I Kings xv, 10,
          Maachah, the daughter of Abishalom, is mentioned as his mother,
          who, according to verse 2, was the mother of Abijah (called
          "Abijam" in I Kings; see [604]Abijah), he was probably not the
          latter's brother, but his son, as is stated in verse 8. Maachah
          was probably the name of both his mother and his grandmother,
          and "daughter of Abishalom" is erroneously inserted in verse 10
          from verse 2. Asa tried to uproot idolatry, and deposed his
          mother "because she had made an idol in a grove" (I Kings xv,
          13, A. V.; R. V., "because she had made an abominable image for
          an Asherah;" the object in question may have been a phallic
          image). He drove the Sodomites from the land, and destroyed the
          idols. The high places, however, were not removed. At the
          suggestion of the prophet Azariah (according to the Chronicler)
          he caused his people to renew their vows to Yahweh at a great
          festival. He is said to have built cities and performed mighty
          deeds, but no details are given.

          What is told of Asa's conduct in the war with Israel does not
          redound to his glory (I Kings xv, 16 sqq.). When Baasha
          fortified Ramah on the frontier between Israel and Judah, Asa
          could think of no better way to retaliate than to hire
          Ben-hadad, king of Syria, to invade Israel. The expedient
          accomplished its immediate purpose by forcing Baasha to retire
          from Ramah; but the ultimate outcome was the hundred years' war
          between Israel and the Arameans, which brought misfortune upon
          both lands and even involved Judah. The Chronicler states that
          the prophet Hanani was sent to rebuke Asa for his conduct, and
          was imprisoned for his boldness. The Chronicler further relates
          that in the eleventh year of Asa's reign "Zerah the Ethiopian"
          invaded Judah and met a great defeat. The event is not mentioned
          in the Book of Kings, and some regard the narrative as
          unhistorical. Those who accept it have not succeeded in
          identifying Zerah the Ethiopian. In his old age Asa suffered
          from a disease of the feet, perhaps gout. [The Chronicler
          characteristically remarks "yet in his disease he sought not to
          Yahweh, but to the physicians".] Asa's history is in I Kings xv,
          9-14; II Chron. xiv-xvi.

          (W. Lotz.)

          The most probable dates for Asa are 912-872 B.C.

   Asbury, Francis
          ASBURY, az´ber-i, FRANCIS: The first Methodist bishop ordained
          in America; b. at Hamstead Bridge, parish of Handsworth (a
          northern suburb of Birmingham), Staffordshire, England, Aug. 20,
          1745; d. at Spottsylvania, Va., Mar. 31, 1816. He became a local
          preacher at the age of sixteen, and an itinerant minister in
          1767; at his own request he was sent by Wesley as a missionary
          to America in 1771, landing at Philadelphia with his companion,
          Richard Wright, Oct. 27; in 1772 he was appointed Wesley's
          "general assistant in America," with supervisory power over all
          the Methodist preachers and societies in the country, but the
          next year was superseded by Thomas Rankin. On the outbreak of
          the Revolutionary War Rankin returned to England, but Asbury
          chose to remain. Like most of the Methodist preachers, he was a
          nonjuror (that is, he had conscientious scruples concerning
          oaths, and refused to take the oath of allegiance required by
          the authorities), and he suffered some annoyance from the
          officials during the war. After the close of the war the
          Methodists were organized into an independent Church,
          [607]Thomas Coke (q.v.) and Asbury being chosen joint
          superintendents at the Christmas Conference at Baltimore, 1784,
          and Asbury ordained by Coke Dec. 27. The remainder of his life
          he devoted to the Church with tireless energy and unflagging
          zeal. [6]

          Asbury was fearless in the discharge of duty, possessed a keen
          wit and uncommon shrewdness, was far-sighted and a good
          organizer. He never married; and his salary was sixty-four
          dollars a year. His early education was defective; but in later
          life he acquired some knowledge of Greek and Hebrew. In 1785 he
          laid the foundation of the first Methodist college, and he
          formed a plan of dividing the country into districts with an
          academy in each. His journal from the date of sailing for
          America to 1780 was published before his death, and the
          remaining years were transcribed and published by F.
          Hollingworth in 1821; it has been often reprinted (cf. The Heart
          of Asbury's Journal, ed. E. S. Tipple, New York, 1905).

   Ascension, Feast of the
          ASCENSION, FEAST OF THE: In Acts i, 3 the fortieth day after the
          resurrection is designated as that of Christ's ascension. The
          Epistle of Barnabas (xv), on the other hand, grounds the
          observance of Sunday on its having been the day marked by both
          the resurrection and the ascension. If this is to be reconciled
          with the Acts, it can only be by the assumption that Luke counts
          four weeks as four decades, just as later ecclesiastical usage
          numbers the Sundays before Lent in this loose way as
          Septuagesima, Sexagesima, and Quinquagesima; but the "forty
          days" of the Acts sounds too definite for this hypothesis to be
          accepted. The Christian Church has observed this commemoration
          on the Thursday of the sixth week after Easter since it has been
          observed at all, which could only be after the festivals of
          Easter and Pentecost were firmly established. Origen does not
          know the festival (Contra Celsum, viii, 23). It is mentioned,
          however, in the Apostolic Constitutions (v, 19, viii, 13); and
          Chrysostom has a homily for it, besides referring to it in
          another place. Socrates (Hist. eccl., vii, 26) mentions, under
          the year 390, that the people celebrated it as an established
          custom in a suburb of Constantinople. In the West its observance
          has been thought to be attested by an obscure canon of the
          Council of Elvira (306); in any case, Augustine knows it as an
          old one (Epist. liv. ad Januarium). Its celebration was
          specially solemn. The paschal candle, lighted at Easter to
          symbolize the resurrection of the Light of the World, is
          extinguished after the Gospel in the high mass of that day
          throughout the Roman Catholic Church, signifying the departure
          of Christ from earth. The Lutheran Reformation in Germany
          retained the feast as Scriptural; and it is observed as one of
          the principal festivals in the Anglican communion.

          (Georg Rietschel.)

          Perhaps the earliest reference to the feast extant is that of
          the Peregrinatio Etheriæ (c. 380), which states that a feast of
          the Ascension was celebrated in Jerusalem toward the close of
          the fourth century, coinciding with the festival of Pentecost
          and observed on the same day. The feast marks the close of the
          paschal season and is a holyday of obligation in the Roman
          Catholic Church. In the Latin liturgy the term "ascension" is
          used exclusively of our Lord. J. T. C.

  ASCETICISM.

          New Testament Teaching (§ 1).

          Asceticism in the Early Church (§ 2).

          Attitude of the Reformers (§ 3).

          True Value and Uses of Asceticism (§ 4).

    1. New Testament Teaching.

          The term "asceticism" (Gk. askesis) originally meant "practise,"
          especially the training of an athlete. In philosophical language
          it denotes moral exercise and discipline (e.g., Epictetus,
          Dissertationes, iii, 12; Diogenes Laertius, VIII, viii, 8), and
          in this sense passed into ecclesiastical language (Eusebius,
          Hist. eccl., II, xvii, 2; Martyres Palæstinæ, x, 2, xi, 2, 22).
          In the history of almost all religions, as well as in ancient
          moral philosophy, asceticism plays an important part, evidenced
          by phenomena like self-mutilation, circumcision, tattooing,
          fasting, flagellations, penance, etc., and by the ethics of the
          Buddhists, Stoics, Pythagoreans, and Neoplatonists. The Old
          Testament manifests, on the whole, few tend encies toward
          outward asceticism; but later Judaism, in its Pharisaic as well
          as in its Hellenistic form, cultivated it, especially in the
          practise of fasting (cf. Dan. x, 3; Tobit xii, 8; Matt. vi, 16,
          ix, 14; Luke xviii, 12). Primitive Christianity kept free from
          this externalizing asceticism. The custom of fasting was
          retained (Matt. iv, 2; Acts xiii, 2, xiv, 23, xviii, 18, xxi,
          24, xxvii, 9; II Cor. xi, 27), but, as in the Old Testament, it
          was only auxiliary to prayer (Esther iv, 16; Dan. ix, 3; Tobit
          xii, 8; Luke ii, 37; Acts x, 30, xiii, 2, xiv, 23), and no merit
          was attached to it. In place of a legal and meritorious
          asceticism the Lord demands watchfulness, sobriety, and prayer
          (Matt. xxiv, 42, xxv, 13; Mark xiii, 37; cf. Acts xx, 31; I Cor.
          xvi, 13; II Cor. vi, 5, xi, 27; Eph. vi, 18; Col. iv, 2; I
          Thess. v, 6, 8; I Pet. i, 13, v, 8; II Pet. iii, 11-12; Rev.
          iii, 3, xvi,15), as well as a readiness to resign everything to
          follow him and to take up the cross (Matt. viii, 21-22, x,
          38-39, xvi, 24, xix, 21; Mark viii, 34, x, 28, 39; Luke ix,
          57-58, xiv, 27). In the morals of Jesus everything depends upon
          the disposition and free deed. Thus Matt. vi, 17-18, ix, 15,
          xix, 12, are not to be understood as outward, ascetic
          regulations. The thoughts of Paul move along the same lines. In
          the moral struggle one must become master of the old man who has
          been put off (Rom. vii, 23, xiii, 14; Gal. v, 17; Eph. vi,
          12-18; Col. iii, 5-8; I Tim. vi, 12), and discipline is also
          necessary to bring the body into subjection (I Cor. ix, 25-27).
          This is the true notion of asceticism as expressed in I Tim. iv,
          7, 8. Remarks like I Cor. vii, 5, 8, 25-40 have not the value of
          generally received ethical laws; the legalism of Jewish life,
          the contempt of marriage, the worshiping of angels, and neglect
          of the body are all rejected (Gal. ii, 12-16; Col. ii, 16-23; I
          Tim. iv, 3). The New Testament, therefore, offers the following
          thoughts as bases for the notion of asceticism: the obligation
          of the Christian to crucify the flesh; the demand to bear the
          cross, to be sober and ready; and the exhortation to " exercise"
          the body and to fashion it into an organ fit for the ends of the
          Christian.

    2. Asceticism in the Early Church.

          Hellenistic and Jewish influences worked together to introduce,
          with " moralism," in the old catholic time an ascetic order of
          life. The institution of certain fast-days, fixed hours of
          prayer, the restricted use of food, abstinence from marriage,
          withdrawal from the world, characterise this tendency.
          Asceticism, no less than " knowledge," came to be considered as
          belonging to Christianity (Clement, Strom., vi, 12). At an early
          period ascetics are found who retire into the desert and leave
          the Church from moral considerations (Irenæus, Hær., III, xi, 9;
          IV, xxvi, 2, xxx, 3, xxxiii, 7). As ascetic tendencies enter
          more deeply into the Church (cf. the case of Origen, Eusebius,
          Hist. eccl., vi, 2), and as the Church comes to know the world
          more intimately, it becomes easier to understand the origin of
          ascetic societies (cf. the pseudo-Clementine Epistles, De
          virginitate; Hieracas, in Epiphanius, Hær., lxvii, 13;
          Athanasius, Vita Antonii, iii, 14; Cyril, Catecheses, iv, 24, v,
          4, xii, 33; Methodius, Convivium, vii, 3; Aphraates, Hom., vi).
          Here was the beginning of the later anchoretic and monastic
          system (see [609]Monasticism).

    3. Attitude of the Reformers.

          On this road the Middle Ages proceeded. The ascetic practises
          were extended more and more, and their extension naturally
          produced among the monks a state of dulness. There are two
          things especially which mark the history of medieval asceticism:
          the institution of penance with its works of satisfaction, and
          the idea of imitating the poverty and suffering of Jesus. The
          first shows a descending evolution, but the second an ascending
          one, tending to introspection, as in the circle of the Friends
          of God. The way of asceticism was considered as the way of
          perfection. The Augsburg Confession (art. xxvi, 8) says of the
          medieval period: " Christianity was thought of as consisting
          solely of the observance of certain holy days, rites, fasts,
          attire." On the other hand, the Reformation abolished on
          principle the medieval estimate of asceticism, because the
          solemn ascetic works are not enjoined by God, but by worthless
          human commandments (art. xxiii, 6 sqq., 19 sqq., xxvi, 18;
          Apol., xxiii, 6, 60, xxvii, 42-57), and can even be regarded as
          suicide and tempting of God (Luther, Werke, Erlangen ed., iv,
          380, vii, 40, ix, 289, xi, 104). The ascetic system is also
          abolished by the concept of righteousness by faith which is
          opposed to meritorious works, which are therefore to be rejected
          (Augs. Con., xx, 8, 9 sqq., xxvi, 1 sqq., 8, xxvii, 3, 44;
          Apo1., xv, 6 sqq.; Art. Schmal., iv, 14; Luther, xx, 250, xvii,
          8, xlii, 262, xliii, 193, lxv, 128, xxi, 330). Thus it is
          asserted that the ascetic works answer not the will of God and
          are not meritorious. For " Christian perfection" ascetic works
          are not necessary; indeed, moral conduct is the more certain
          evidence of God's presence (Augs. Con., xvi, 4 sqq., xxvi, 10,
          xxvii, 10 sqq., xv, 49, 57; Apol., xv, 25-26, xvii, 61; Longer
          Catechism, precept iv, 145). But asceticism is hereby not done
          away with. The " mortification of the flesh" ever remains a
          Christian duty (Augs. Con., xxvi, 31 sqq.). But by this is not
          meant a weakening and destruction of the natural powers, but the
          self-discipline by which the natural powers are made subject to
          the soul, thus becoming fit for serving God. Outward
          fast-regulations are therefore very useful, but should never
          become a law (Luther, xliii, 197-199, lxv, 128). The Protestant
          view is briefly this: " Every one can use his own discretion as
          to fasting and watching, for every one knows how much he must do
          to master his body. Those, however, who think to become pious
          through works have no regard for fasting, but only for the works
          and, imagining that they are pious when they do much in that
          direction, sometimes break their heads over it and ruin their
          bodies over it" (Luther, xxvii, 27, 190, xliii, 199, 201, x,
          290, xxi, 240, x, 250). It is useless to continue the historical
          review, since no essentially new types of asceticism have
          appeared in the Church. The Roman Catholic Church adheres on
          principle to the medieval conception, yet in the Jesuitic
          "Spiritual Exercises" the purely sensual asceticism strongly
          recedes, and there is accommodation to the modern spirit.
          Mysticism and pietism in evangelical Christendom have demanded
          renunciation and seclusion in a one-sided manner (cf. C. E.
          Luthardt, Geschichte der Ethik, ii, Leipsic, 1893, 154 sqq., 248
          sqq., and the histories of pietism by Ritschl and Schmid; see
          [610]Pietism).

    4. True Value and Uses of Asceticism.

          Asceticism is a special moral act. Christian moral acts are
          free, devoted to the acquisition of the highest good or the
          realisation of the kingdom of God. They have for their object
          the reformation of one's own personality (conversion and
          sanctification), as well as the influence on the surrounding
          conditions to be realized by this personality. The Christian
          life is a continual fight with sin, but is to overcome it by
          virtue of the effects of grace. This task can not in itself be
          called an "exercise," since it rather denotes the
          self-preservation of the Christian. To effect this
          self-preservation in the struggle against sin the Christian must
          indeed exercise and stretch his powers for the struggle. The
          object of morality is opposition to sin and the positive
          exemplification of the good. To bring this about it is necessary
          to have the mastery over the natural gifts and powers of man,
          which is obtained by attention to self, by watchfulness, and by
          accustoming one's own nature to subjection to the moral will.
          Asceticism is not directly a struggle against sin and
          realization of the Christian good, but it aims at such a rule
          over the natural powers that one is qualified to follow the good
          will readily in the struggle against sin and in the positive
          moral exemplification. The typical forms of asceticism (fasting,
          self-denial, etc.) show that the question is not directly the
          overcoming of sin or of doing good works, but the training of
          the natural powers for both. This is the specifically
          evangelical conception of asceticism. On the other hand, the
          Roman Catholics define asceticism as a direct moral act and as
          "the summary of all which serves to promote moral perfection"
          (Pruner, in KL, i, 1460); or asceticism is explained as that
          part of theology which "develops the principles of Christian
          perfection and points out the practical rules which bring about
          the soul's elevation to God" (J. Ribet, L'Ascétique chrétienne,
          Paris, 1888). Here the various exercises of asceticism are moral
          self-interest and good works, whereas, according to evangelical
          conception, asceticism is self-discipline to make one fit for
          good works; in this subordination it is a moral deed itself.
          Asceticism is therefore self-control in the true sense of the
          word.

          Upon a closer examination the point here is this: (1) The task
          is to exercise nature in patience, watchfulness, self-denial,
          and sobriety, so that it becomes fit to bear the sufferings of
          the cross sent by God as a blessing. These are given to man from
          God for "the mortifying of the flesh "; the question is not of
          self-mortification and invited martyrdom. The cross is not to
          incite the Christian to sin, but to restrain the sinful lust.
          From this point of view the Christian is to consider the
          suffering and be affected by it. (2) Our nature in consequence
          of the sinfulness of man is exercised and ready to walk the ways
          pointed out by the evil will. In concrete things it exemplifies
          chiefly the dominion of the sensual desires over the spiritual
          will. Over against this, it is a Christian duty to accustom
          nature to subjugation under the spiritual will, to the
          regulation of the desires, to regularity and propriety of life,
          to steadfastness in useful work, to the proper relation between
          labor and recreation. Here one has to deal with moral
          gymnastics, which are to fit human nature to obey the good moral
          will imparted by grace. (3) For each man exist certain thoughts
          and incentives which in themselves are morally indifferent, but,
          as experience teaches, may become a temptation to the
          individual. To restrain these is the further object of
          asceticism; and herein it includes fasting in the ardent sense,
          e.g., with reference to society, eating and drinking, matrimony,
          sexual intercourse, novel-reading, the theater, dancing, total
          abstinence. etc. The question here is of a moral dietetics. With
          this the field of asceticism is circumscribed. Only it should be
          added that the ascetic practica1 proof must never become a law;
          it calls only for individual self-restraint. This, however, as
          little precludes ascetic habits in the individual as ascetic
          customs in communities. It must also be emphasized that the
          question can not be as to the meritorious character of
          asceticism; for, in the first place, this thought has no place
          in evangelical ethics; in the second place, because the
          necessity of ascetic exercises proves not man's moral maturity,
          but immaturity. Finally, it must be remarked that in the
          concrete life the ascetic practical proof can not be separated
          from sanctification and the moral struggle.

          ASCHHEIM, ash´haim, SYNOD OF: A synod held in a village of what
          is now Bavaria, a little to the east of Munich. The church there
          is mentioned in the seventh century. The year of the synod is
          not definitely named; but since Tassilo is mentioned as prince,

          influenced by those of the Frankish synod of Verneuil (July 11,
          755), it must have been held either in the latter half of that

   Asherah
          ASHERAH (pl. asherim; in Judges iii, 7, II Chron. xix, 3,
          xxxiii, 3, asheroth): The transliteration of a Hebrew word which
          in the A. V. of the English Bible (following the LXX and
          Vulgate) is rendered "grove" or "groves" (see [613]Groves and
          Trees, Sacred); in the A. V. the word is transferred (" Asherah
          ") without attempt at translation.

    Two Distinct Meanings.

          In explaining its meaning two entirely different senses in which
          it is employed must be distinguished: (1) as a sacred tree-stem
          or pole; (2) as the name of a Canaanitic goddess. There is now
          no doubt of the general meaning when the word is used in the
          former sense. Exactly what the latter refers to is still a
          matter of much debate. There are only three passages (Judges
          iii, 7; I Kings xviii, 19; II Kings xxiii, 4) in which the word
          (used with baal) clearly refers to a goddess; or, rather, only
          two, for in Judges the reading should be ashtaroth (pl. of
          ashtoreth; see [614]Ashtoreth) as in similar early statements
          with regard to forbidden cults. The passage I Kings xv, 13,
          often supposed to refer to the worship of a goddess, should be
          translated as in the R. V. "made an abominable thing for (i.e.,
          as) an asherah." The other two passages in Kings are regarded by
          recent conservative commentators as interpolations (cf. R.
          Kittel, Die Bücher der Könige, Göttingen, 1900, pp. 143, 300),
          and certainly justify the conclusion that at a late period
          asherah was used as another name for Ashtoreth. How this came
          about may be explained from the history of the asherah in
          Israel.

    The Preexilic Asherah.

          In preexilic times an asherah was not a divine companion or
          concurrent of a baal or the baals at all. It was, however, an
          indispensable part of the normal baal-worship. A "high-place,"
          or shrine of the baal (bamah) consisted of an altar (with or
          without a "sanctuary" ), a maz?z?ebhah or stone pillar, and an
          asherah (see [615]Altar; [616]High Place; [617]Memorials and
          Sacred Stones). The pillar was a survival of the old
          stone-worship; that is to say, the adoration of the local
          deities or numina, who had their abode in sacred stones (cf. the
          bethel of Gen. xxviii, 19 and elsewhere). The asherah or sacred
          pole was in like manner a survival of the old tree-worship, that
          is, of the cult of sacred trees whose sanctity is a marked
          feature of the early histories (e.g., Gen. xii, 6, R. V.; Judges
          ix, 37, R. V.). In the Hebrew text of Deut. xi, 30; Judges ix, 6
          (cf. R. V.) the sacred tree and the sacred stone appear standing
          side by side. One step further in the inevitable syncretism was
          the combination of both of these with the cult of the baal, the
          presiding divinity or "proprietor" of the district, who gave
          fertility to its soil and all consequential blessings to its
          inhabitants (cf. Hos. ii, 5, 8; see [618]Baal). Whatever other
          factors may have contributed to this cherishing of the asherim,
          these are the most important. At first the asherim were probably
          the stems of trees rudely chopped and stripped; afterward they
          were conventionalized into a shapely pole or mast, just as the
          "pillars" or maz?z?ebhoth were at first roughly hewn blocks of
          stone.

    Transformed into a Goddess.

          At a later stage the asherah became transfigured into a goddess
          and naturally took the place of the old Ashtoreth in the
          imagination of the Hebrews, who, after the Exile, followed no
          longer the old Canaanitic rites. The fact that the worship of
          Ashtoreth had been combined with that of the baals, or rather
          absorbed into it, doubtless helped toward the substitution. The
          deification of an outward object of worship is a familiar
          phenomenon in nearly all religions, and in the present field of
          inquiry is actually paralleled by the conversion of a bethel or
          bait-ili (a god-inhabited stone) into a god, Baitulos, among the
          Phenicians and elsewhere (cf. Schrader, KAT, pp. 437-438).

          Whether the fact that there was an old Canaanitic goddess
          Ashirtu, with a Babylonian namesake, aided in the confusion, in
          the Hebrew literature, of the two senses of asherah, is not
          quite clear. It is, at any rate, practically certain that in the
          time of the active idolatrous worship of Israel the asherah was
          not a goddess. See [619]Ashtoreth.

    1. The Cult in Palestine and Syria.

          Ashtoreth is the name of a goddess whose worship, mostly
          associated with that of Baal or the baals, figured largely in
          the history of idolatry in ancient Israel. This divinity is
          especially marked as a goddess of the "Sidonians" or Phenicians
          (I Kings xi, 5, 33; II Kings xxiii, 13). She had also a temple
          among the Philistines at Ascalon, probably the same as that
          mentioned by Herodotus (i, 105) East of the Jordan her worship
          was rife in Moab, combined with that of the national god,
          Ashtar-Chemosh being named on the Moabite Stone in the ninth
          century B.C.; and the place names Ashtaroth (Deut. i, 4 and
          elsewhere), Ashteroth-Karnaim (Gen. xiv, 5), and Be-eshterah
          (Josh. xxi, 27) indicate its prevalence in the country of
          Bashan. That it was of ancient date in southern Syria is proved
          by Egyptian references to the goddess "Ashtart of the Hittite
          land." The most widely attested of three branches of the general
          cult among Canaanitic or Hebraic peoples is the Phenician, which
          is commemorated by many inscriptions both in the home country
          and in the western colonies.

    2. Significance of the Related Names.

          This famous goddess is also widely known as Astarte, which is
          the Greek form of the Phenician Ashtart. The name Ashtoreth
          itself in the original Hebrew texts was Ashtareth, the Masoretic
          form being a change made by using the vowels of bosheth, "the
          shameful thing," a nickname of [620]Baal (q.v.). The Phenician
          ashtart clearly points to the correct reading, as also does the
          Hebrew plural Ashtaroth. The Babylonian and Assyrian form Ishtar
          is modified from Ashtar, according to a regular phonetic law,
          through the influence of the initial guttural. Ashtar is
          identical with the South Arabian Athtar and Aramaic and North
          Arabian Atar (from Athtar), the former being a god and the
          latter apparently a goddess. Of the Arabian cult very little is
          known. When more has been learned of South Arabian mythology,
          much of the mystery which surrounds the origin of the universal
          Semitic worship of Ishtar-Ashtoreth will be cleared up.

    3. Extension of Ishtar Worship.

          The following are the most important of the facts which may be
          regarded as established or practically certain: The cult
          originated in Babylonia and spread northward to Assyria,
          northwestward to Mesopotamia, thence to Syria and Palestine, and
          thence through the Phenicians to all of the Mediterranean
          peoples; south and southwestward it spread to Arabia, and thence
          across the sea to Abyssinia.

    4. The Early Ishtar Cult.

          Both the name and the dominant forms of the cult were of Semitic
          and not of "Turanian" or Sumerian origin. There was a goddess
          [621]Nana (q.v.) at Erech in South Babylonia, who was held to be
          identical with Ishtar simply because she had been worshiped
          there by a non-Semitic people, and, having attributes akin to
          those of Ishtar, was replaced by the latter when the Semites
          took over the ancient shrine. A similar syncretism took place
          under the same conditions in the interest both of Ishtar herself
          and of other Semitic divinities which she absorbed and
          superseded. The word Ishtar is a Babylonian verbal noun of the
          ifteal stem though the etymology is still unsettled.

    5. Dominant Types of Ishtar Worship. Its Astral Significance.

          The worship of Ishtar was of very complex origin, both in its
          primary and in its secondary sources. When in greatest vogue as
          a principal Semitic religion it was, as above indicated, a
          composite or syncretism of many related cults, non-Semitic as
          well as Semitic. Of these some left deep traces of their
          original distinctive features and remained in part practically
          separate cults. Such, for example, was the worship of Ishtar of
          Arbela, in which the divinity appears as a war-goddess--an
          attribute probably suggested by the very natural conception of
          the planet Venus being the leader of the starry hosts. Ishtar
          was in fact primarily and chiefly identified with this most
          beautiful of celestial objects, especially as the evening star.
          This conception spread from Babylonia through the other Semitic
          lands to the Phenician settlements, and then mainly by way of
          Cyprus, to the Greeks and Romans as the cults of Aphrodite and
          Venus. Among its primary sources, therefore, the worship of
          Ishtar was in large part astral, and Venus was its favorite
          celestial object. This combination was not of late origin, but
          is known to have been made in very early times (cf. Schrader,
          KAT, pp. 424 sqq.). The moon in the Ishtar cult never took the
          place of Venus; for the moon among the Semites was a male deity,
          whose worship was older than even that of Ishtar and was
          centered in Sin, the moon-god par excellence. Hence Ishtar in
          the inscriptions is represented not only as the daughter of Anu,
          the great heaven-god, but also as the daughter of Sin. It was as
          impossible that "the queen of heaven" of Jer. vii, 18 and other
          passages could be a name of the moon among the Hebrews in
          Palestine or Egypt as it could be among the Babylonians. The
          identification of Ishtar with the fixed star Sirius and with the
          constellation Virgo (perhaps through its beautiful star Spica),
          though comparatively early, was of secondary origin.

    6. The Sensual Development.

          From the terrestrial side the primary motive of the worship of
          Ishtar was the impulse to deify sensuousness and sensuality. Of
          the resulting worship Ishtar-Venus became the celestial patron.
          She not only legitimated the sexual indulgences which marked her
          cult in Babylonia, Phenicia, Palestine, and the Semitic world
          generally, but she was naturally taken as the authoress of the
          sexual passion and therewith of all derivative and associated
          sentiments. This accounts for the part played by Ashtoreth or
          Astarte as the female counterpart of the Phenician Baal and of
          the local Canaanitic baals, and also for the wide-spread and
          influential myth of her relations with her lover Tammuz or
          Adonis (Ezek. viii, 14); see [622]Tammuz.

    7. The Worship as Spiritualized.

          Linked with these primary attributes in the most remarkable and
          instructive ways was the worship of Ishtar as the fountain of
          the tenderest and most sacred human sentiments, also of
          imaginative conceptions of external nature, and even experiences
          of the inner moral and spiritual life (on the process of
          transition cf. J. F. McCurdy, History, Prophecy, and the
          Monuments, iii, New York, 1901, §§ 1184 sqq.). The best
          illustrations are afforded by the Babylonian hymns to Ishtar as
          the great mother-goddess, as the creator of the animate universe
          generally (cf. the exordium of Lucretius, De rerum natura), and
          as the helper of men, freeing them from sickness and the curse
          of sin and guilt.

    8. Tendency of the Cult in Israel.

          Though we learn nothing directly from the Old Testament as to
          the character of the service of Ashtoreth in Palestine, the
          connections in which the word occurs make it clear that,
          whatever else may have been here and there included, the lowest
          forms of Ishtar worship were ordinarily exhibited. The regular
          association in the singular with "the baal" and in the plural
          (Ashtaroth) with "the baals" indicates the predominance of the
          sexual aspects of the many-sided cult. Its popularity and
          seductiveness are also manifested in the use of the plural
          (exactly as in Babylonian) as an equivalent of goddesses in
          general (Judges ii, 13, x, 8; I Sam. vii, 3, 4, xii, 10) in
          passages which, it is true, proceed from later deuteronomic
          editing, but are therefore all the more indicative of the
          prevailing tendency.

          A comprehensive historical view of the whole subject helps to
          understand the fascination of Astarte worship as a seductive and
          formidable obstacle to the service of Yahweh. See [623]Assyria,
          VII; [624]Atargatis; [625]Asherah; [626]Baal; [627]Babylonia,
          VII, 2, § 7; [628]3, § 5.

   Ash Wednesday
          ASH WEDNESDAY (Lat. Dies cineris, feria quarta cinerum): The
          first day of Lent, the beginning of the forty days' fast before
          Easter in the Western Church. The name is not simply a general
          allusion to the repentance in sackcloth and ashes of which the
          prophets speak in the Old Testament, but refers more directly to
          a rite which marks the observance of the day in the Roman
          Catholic Church. The palm-branches blessed on the Palm-Sunday of
          the previous year are burned to ashes, and these ashes are
          placed in a vessel on the altar before the beginning of mass.
          The priest, wearing a violet cope (the color of mourning), prays
          that God will send his angel to hallow the ashes, that they may
          become a salutary remedy to all penitents. Then follows the
          prayer of benediction, which explains the symbolical meaning of
          the use of ashes still more clearly. The ashes are then thrice
          sprinkled with holy water and censed, after which the celebrant
          kneels and places some of them upon his own head. The
          congregation then approach the altar and kneel, while the sign
          of the cross is made upon their foreheads with the blessed
          ashes; to each one are said the words Memento, homo, quia pulvis
          es et in pulverem reverteris (" Remember, O man, that dust thou
          art and unto dust shalt thou return" ).

          It is impossible to determine accurately the date at which the
          imposition of ashes, which originally formed a part of the
          public penance for grievous sinners, became a custom applicable
          to all the faithful. It is demonstrably at least as old as the
          synod of Beneventum in 1091, which expressly commands it for
          clergy and laity alike. In the Anglican communion the day is
          marked by a special service known as the "[629]commination
          service," (q.v.) or at least by a special collect and Scripture
          lessons; and the Irvingite liturgy also contains prayers for it.

    I. The Name.

          The term "Asia Minor" is not found is the New Testament; it is
          said to occur first in Orosius, i, 2 (400 A.D.). In the
          apostolic period "Asia" denoted the continent, Asia Minor, and
          the Roman province of Asia. Paul no doubt understood by Asia,
          the Roman province (I Cor. xvi, 19; II Cor. i, 8; II Tim. i,
          l5). The Apocalypse includes also the Phrygian Laodicea; and the
          provincial district is doubtless meant in I Pet. i, 1, where
          Asia stands after Pontus, Galatia, and Cappadocia and before
          Bithynia, though it is uncertain whether the author was informed
          of the political character of these designations. How far the
          Roman provincial demarcations had become familiar to the people
          it is difficult to tell. There are passages in the New Testament
          in which the term Asia is used in a narrower sense. In the time
          of Paul the country was still in a stage of development.

    II. The Province of Asia.

          When Attalus III of Pergamos in 133 B.C. willed his country to
          the Romans, it was declared a province, though the real
          organization was not effected until 129. The main parts were the
          maritime districts Mysia, Lydia, and Caria. With these Cicero
          (Pro Flacco, xxvii, 65) mentions Phrygia, which belonged to the
          province after 116. Under the emperors Asia was a senatorial
          province ruled by a proconsul, whose seat was at Ephesus. The
          diet of the province, to which representatives (Gk. asiarchai;
          cf. Acts xix, 31) were sent, met annually in different cities.
          Its powers and duties culminated in the imperial cult; and hence
          it was presided over by the sacerdos provinciæ or, Greek,
          archiereus tes Asias, who offered the sacrifices and pronounced
          the vow for the emperor and his house. This office changed
          annually and the years were dated accordingly.

    III. The Imperial Cult.

          The empire as the guaranty of peace and the source of all
          blessings of culture appeared to the people as a divine power.
          From his point of view the author of the Apocalypse (xiii, 3-8)
          describes this worship of the empire by the world. He is
          convinced that the empire owes its success to a supernatural
          power, but not to the God of heavenâ?"rather to the devil. The
          Jews as a rule enjoyed religious liberty throughout the empire,
          and were not required to take part in the imperial cult. What
          CÃ¦sar had granted to them was confirmed by Augustus and
          Claudius. The sufferings of the Christians of Asia Minor,
          mentioned in the First Epistle of Peter, were not caused by
          their refusal to take part in this worship (cf. ii, 13 sqq.). It
          is true that the populace hated and persecuted the Christians,
          but not because they refused to honor the emperor; the name of
          this new superstitio was distrusted and outlawed as at Rome in
          the time of Nero (Tacitus, Annales, xv, 44).

    IV. Cities.

          The number of free cities was steadily reduced under the
          emperors; and immunity from taxation was granted in place of
          autonomy. An edict of Antoninus Pius divided the cities into
          three classes according to size and importance. Pliny (Hist.
          nat., V, xxix, 105 sqq.) mentions nine cities which possessed a
          court of justice, viz.: Laodicea ad Lycum, Synnada, Apamea,
          Alabanda, Sardis, Smyrna, Ephesus, Adramyttium, and Pergamos.
          Ephesus, at the mouth of the Cayster, often called on
          inscriptions "the first and greatest metropolis of Asia," was
          the seat of the proconsul. Another title of the city is
          "temple-keeper" (i.e., of Diana; cf. Acts xix, 35, R. V.; the
          Greek is neÅ?koros, the usual word for the custodian of a
          temple). A college of virgin priestesses ministered to Diana,
          presided over by a eunuch called Megabysos. It was no
          exaggeration of Demetrius when he said that the Ephesian Artemis
          was worshiped not only by all Asia, but by the whole world (Acts
          xix, 27); for through Ephesus flowed the commerce between the
          East and the West. Among the strangers residing there were many
          Jews, who had a synagogue (Acts xviii,19, 26, xix, 8) and
          enjoyed special privileges, especially those who were Roman
          citizens, as may be seen from documents contained in Josephus
          and Philo. Ephesus was a member of the confederation of the
          thirteen Ionian cities, of which Miletus was the head.

          A great road led from Ephesus to Magnesia, where was another
          temple of Artemis which Strabo places on a par with the
          Ephesian. Christianity came to Magnesia from Ephesus; among the
          epistles of Ignatius, that to the Magnesians immediately follows
          that to the Ephesians. After Magnesia, Strabo mentions Tralles
          (also mentioned by Ignatius), once a wealthy city, called
          CÃ¦sarea under Augustus. Jews also dwelt there; and it is
          possible that the Gospel was brought thither from Ephesus (Acts
          xix, 10). It seems that special missionary attention was devoted
          to the cities along the Meander-Lykos road; for one meets with
          the three closely connected Phrygian congregations Laodicea,
          Hierapolis, and ColossÃ¦, of which Laodicea was the most
          important and is alone mentioned in the Apocalypse. The
          Christian community seems to have shared in the wealth of the
          city (Rev. iii, 17). Laodicea never had an emperor's temple.
          Polycrates of Ephesus mentions among the "great lights" of Asia
          a bishop and martyr with the Phrygian name Lagaris as buried at
          Laodicea (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., IV, xxiv, 5). In 185 there was
          "great strife concerning the Passover there" (ib. IV, xxvi, 3).
          ColossÃ¦, an important city of Phrygia, was long the seat of a
          bishop. More important than ColossÃ¦ was Hierapolis, the native
          place of the philosopher Epictetus, and the place in which the
          apostle Philip lived and died. Papias was bishop of Hierapolis,
          as was also Claudius Apollinaris. Apamea was founded by
          Antiochus Soter and was the seat of a conventus juridicus. That
          many Jews lived here is known from Cicero (Pro Flacco, xxviii);
          they had their own constitution, a "law of the Jews."

          The Lydian Philadelphia was sparsely populated on account of the
          frequent earthquakes. The Gospel was brought thither from
          Ephesus. Philadelphia is one of the seven churches of Asia
          mentioned in the Apocalypse (iii, 7-13); among its inhabitants
          Jews are mentioned (iii, 9). Ignatius addressed an epistle to
          the Philadelphians; and Eusebius (Hist. eccl., V, xvii, 3)
          mentions a prophetess Ammia of Philadelphia. Sardis was the
          ancient city of the Lydian kings. Jews lived there, having their
          own jurisdiction. The Church at Sardis, one of the seven
          mentioned in the Apocalypse (iii, 1-6), was the episcopal see of
          Melito in the time of Antoninus Pius. Two famous roads led from
          Sardis: one to Pergamos by way of Thyatira, the other to Smyrna.
          All three cities are mentioned among the seven Churches of the
          Apocalypse. Thyatira was known especially for its gild of dyers.
          The Lydia mentioned in Acts xvi, 14, called a "seller of
          purple," had probably come to Philippi with wool which had been
          dyed at home. Thyatira plays an important part in the history of
          Montanism (Epiphanius, HÃ¦r., li, 33). Taking a western road
          from Thyatira one comes to Smyrna, where in 195 B.C. a temple
          was built in honor of the dea Roma. Tiberius allowed a temple to
          be erected here to himself, his mother, and the senate.
          Politically Smyrna was not as important as Ephesus; but it had
          the reputation of being the most beautiful city of Asia. Jews in
          Smyrna are mentioned in Rev. ii, 9 and in the Martyrium
          Polycarpi, xii, 2, and both times as enemies of the Christians.
          Paul does not seem to have done missionary work there; but that
          the congregation was founded by John is not a necessary
          inference. By the "angel of the church in Smyrna" (Rev. ii, 8)
          Polycarp might be meant, had not the epistles to the seven
          churches originated in a much earlier period than the final
          redaction of the Apocalypse. From Smyrna the road leads by way
          of Cyme, Myrina, and Elæa to Pergamos, where it meets the road
          to Thyatira. Pergamos, the ancient royal city of the Attalides,
          was still famous under the Roman empire. In the time of Augustus
          (29 B.C.) the first provincial temple was erected here, and by
          the side of Ephesus Pergamos seems to have been the most
          prominent city in Asia. It was famous for the cult of
          Æsculapius. Although the Jews had influence, they were not the
          cause of the animosities mentioned in Rev. ii, 12-17. Though
          they are called in the Apocalypse a "synagogue of Satan" (ii,
          9), it is most unlikely that they are meant by the words: " I
          know . . . where thou dwellest, where Satan's seat is" (ii, 13);
          the language points to a more concrete phenomenon, which might
          be thought of as an embodiment of Satan, and no doubt refers to
          the worship of Æsculapius. This "savior," whose symbol was the
          serpent, and who, according to Justin (Apologia, i, 21, 22),
          looked much like Christ, could easily appear as a devilish
          caricature of the Son of God. The words "hast not denied my
          faith" imply that in the days of Antipas the population made an
          effort to force the worship of Æculapius upon others.

          From the seaport Adramyttium, where there was a conventus
          juridicus, following the north coast of the Adramyttian bay the
          road leads to Assos, where Paul seems to have been active (Acts
          xx, 13-14). It was the birthplace of Cleanthes the Stoic. Troas,
          or rather Alexandria, became famous under Roman sway. Augustus
          made it a colony. It was the seaport from which Paul went to
          Macedonia (Acts xvi, 11). It is perhaps characteristic of the
          Roman citizen, that, besides Ephesus, Troas is the only city of
          the province of Asia where Paul labored in person (Acts xx, 5-7;
          II Cor. ii, 12; II Tim. iv, 13). The Church of Troas is not
          mentioned in the Apocalypse, but is referred to by Ignatius in
          his epistles to the Philadelphians (xi, 2) and Smyrnæans (xii,
          2). Abydus, Lampsacus, and Cyzicus were not included in Paul's
          mission.

    V. The Islands of the Ægean Sea.

          The Islands of the Ægean Sea belonged in great part to the
          province of Asia. Tenedos was opposite Alexandria Troas; Lesbos,
          with the capital Mytilene, or as the later form reads in Acts
          xx, 14, Mitylene, was the first station on the passage from
          Assos. Thence Paul sailed (Acts xx, 15) to Chios, opposite the
          Ionic peninsula. On the following day he reached Samos.
          According to the reading of Codex D, he seems not to have
          tarried on the island itself in the city of Samos, but in the
          town of Trogyllium on a little isle of like name before the
          cape, mentioned by Strabo. South of Samos lay the small island
          of Patmos. Following the route of Paul (Acts xxi, 1) one comes
          to Coos and Rhodes. During the last decades before Christ,
          Rhodes was a center of culture; it was the native place of the
          Stoic Panætius, whose work "On Duty" Cicero used in his De
          officiis; in Rhodes, too, labored his pupil Posidonius (about
          90-50 B.C.); the rhetorician Apollonius Molon, the teacher of
          Cicero and Cæsar; and Theodore of Gadara, the teacher of
          Tiberius.

    VI. The Province Pontus-Bithynia.

          When King Nicomedes III, Philopator, of Bithynia bequeathed in
          74 B.C. his country to the Romans, the governor of Asia made it
          a province, and it was extended toward the east in 64 B.C. by
          annexing north Paphlagonia and Pontus. After the separation of
          Pontus Galaticus, which was joined to Galatia, the new province
          with the double name Pontus (and) Bithynia comprised the entire
          coast region east of the Rhyndacus, north of Mt. Olympus,
          extending beyond the Halys to the city of Amisus. As a
          senatorial province it was ruled by proconsuls with a legate, a
          questor, and six lictors. Pliny the Younger was an extraordinary
          governor, who was sent to the province (111-112 A.D.) to
          regulate its finances. The domestic conditions in Bithynia are
          described not only in the correspondence of Pliny the Younger
          with Trajan, but also in the speeches of the sophist Dio
          Chrysostomus of Prusa, which have much of interest to the
          investigator of early Christianity (ed. H. von Arnim, 2 vols.,
          Berlin, 1893-96; cf. also idem, Dio von Prusa, ib. 1898). The
          most noteworthy of the cities of Pontus and Bithynia were
          Apames, Chalcedon, Byzantium, and Pruss. A court of judgment was
          also at Nicæa (see [631]Nicæa, Councils of), where there was a
          temple of the dea Roma and of the divus Julius, whereas the
          provincial temple was at Nicomedia. In Pontus were Amastris,
          Sinope, Amisus, Abonuteichus, and Comana. Concerning the Jews in
          Pontus and Bithynia cf. Acts ii, 9, xviii, 2. The spread of
          Christianity in Pontus is attested by Pliny (Epist., xcvi, 9).

    VII. The Province Galatia.

          The Province Galatia has a complicated history. Its boundaries
          were often changed. It derived its name from the Celtic tribes
          which migrated to Asia Minor in the third century B.C., and,
          according to Strabo, occupied the eastern part of Phrygia.
          Without going into details, it can be assumed that in the New
          Testament "Galatia" means not the seat of the three Celtic
          tribes, but the Roman province including Pisidia and Lycaonia,
          therefore the territory of the first Pauline missionary journey.
          The question is of interest whether by "the Churches of Galatia"
          (Gal. i, 2) Paul understood only those of the first missionary
          journey. He shows an inclination to address his Church according
          to provinces, following the Roman provincial divisions. When he
          addresses a Church with reference to its special needs, he
          naturally speaks to Corinthians, Thessalonians, Philippians; but
          where he overlooks his missionary territory as a whole, he uses
          the provincial names. There is no reason to believe that "the
          Churches of Galatia" means anything else than the Churches of
          the Roman province. Since the Epistle to the Galatians was not
          addressed to one Church, but to a number of Churches, Paul had
          to select a name expressive of all; and the designation "
          Churches of Galatia" was quite natural and appropriate for the
          Roman citizen, to whom the political divisions of the empire,
          were no fortuitous arrangement, but a moral good. In the time of
          Paul there were no Galatians in the old sense; and the name
          means subjects of the Roman emperor belonging to the province of
          Galatia. Similarly Tychicus and the Ephesian Trophimus (Acts
          xxi, 29) are said to be of Asia (xx, 4); and Gaius and
          Aristarchus are called Macedonians (xix, 29, xxvii, 2; cf. II
          Cor. ix, 2, 4), although Gaius was certainly no Macedonian by
          birth. Of the Galatian cities Ancyra was the seat of the
          governor, having the provincial temple of Augustus and of the
          dea Roma, on the walls of which the deeds of Augustus were
          inscribed (the so-called monumentum Ancyranum). From Ancyra the
          road leads eastward to Tavium, the ancient capital of the
          Trocmæ. The capital of the Tolistobogi was Pessinus, famous for
          the rich temple dedicated to Cybele, whom the natives called
          Agdistis. North of Pessinus was Germa, a colony founded by
          Augustus (Julia Augusta Fida Germæ). For military purposes a
          direct connection must have existed with Antioch in Pisidia
          (Acts xiii, 14), where Augustus had established a military
          colony under the name of Cæsarea, not mentioned in the New
          Testament. It was the center of a system of military settlements
          which the emperor established to protect the province against
          the mountain tribes of Pisidia and Isaurica. It is possible that
          Paul went to Iconium by way of Antioch. According to Strabo,
          Iconium belonged to Lycaonia; but in Acts xiv, 6 it seems not to
          be reckoned among the Lycaonian cities; the population was
          Phrygian. The Jews had a synagogue and in the Acts of Paul and
          Thecla a proconsul is erroneously mentioned in Iconium. Another
          city was Lystra, which was a Roman colony and had a temple of
          Jupiter. Another colony was Derbe at the south end of the
          province.

    VIII. The Province Lycia-Pamphylia.

          The Province Lycia-Pamphylia was organized by Claudius in 43
          A.D. and again under Vespasian. Till 135 it was governed by the
          emperor; afterward, by the senate. Among the six larger cities
          of Lycia which are mentioned by Strabo are the two maritime
          towns Patara and Myra, through which Paul passed on his journeys
          (Acts xxi, 1-2, xxvii, 5-6). Phaselis, with three ports, did not
          belong to the Lycian confederacy in the time of Strabo, but was
          independent. The Jews in Phaselis are mentioned in I Macc. xv,
          23. Of the Pamphylian cities Attalia is of special interest,
          because Paul on returning from his first missionary journey went
          thither to sail to Antioch (Acts xiv, 25-26). Ramsay suggests
          that the same vessel which brought the apostle from Paphos took
          him to Perga also.

    IX. The Province Cilicia.

          The Province Cilicia varied in extent at different times. Under
          Cicero's administration (51-50 B.C.), besides Cilicia,
          Pamphylia, Pisidia, Isaurica, and Lycaonia, the districts of
          Laodicea, Apamea, Synnada, and Cyprus, afterward joined with
          Asia, belonged to it. Through the organization of the provinces
          of Galatia (25 B.C.), Pamphylia (43 A.D.), and Cyprus (22 B.C.),
          the territory of the province was reduced to Cilicia proper. The
          western part of it, Cilicia Aspera, was given by Augustus to
          Archelaus of Cappadocia (25 B.C.), with Elaiussa-Sebaste as
          capital; and Caligula gave it to Antiochus IV of Commagene.
          Under Vespasian it was restored to the province of Cilicia.
          Considering the small extent which the province had under the
          first emperors, it no doubt was under the jurisdiction of the
          procurator of Syria. Under Hadrian Cilicia Campestris and Aspera
          became one imperial province. Under Domitian the seat of
          government was Antioch, otherwise Tarsus was the metropolis.
          From the time of Antony it was an urbs libera, densely populated
          and wealthy; it was the home of the Stoic philosopher
          Athenodorus, son of Sandon, the honored teacher of Augustus,
          perhaps also of Strabo. According to Cicero (Ad Atticum, XVI,
          xi, 4, xiv, 4), he helped him in the preparation of the De
          officiis. A rival of Tarsus was Anazarbus, called also Cæsarea,
          native city of the physician and author Dioscorides, who lived
          under Nero, and whose work, De materia medica (ed. C. Sprengel,
          Leipsic, 1829), Luke is said to have perused (cf. P. de Lagarde,
          Psalterium juxta Hebræos Hieronymi, Leipsic, 1874, pp. 165 sqq.;
          W. K. Hobart, The Medical Language of St. Luke, Dublin. 1882;
          Zahn, Einleitung, ii, 384, 435). From Tarsus the highroad leads
          over the Cilician Taurus to Cappadocia. On the road from Tarsus
          to Issus and Alexandria was Mopsuestia, the episcopal see of
          Theodore.

    X. Cyprus.

          After a temporary union with Cilicia the province of Cyprus was
          separated in 22 B.C. and organized as a senatorial province,
          ruled by a proprætor pro consule with a legate and questor. Many
          Jews lived in Cyprus, and Cyprian Jewish Christians brought the
          Gospel to Antioch (Acts xi, 20); Barnabas was from Cyprus (Acts
          iv, 36). In Salamis there were many synagogues. In the revolt
          under Trajan the Jews killed 240,000 non-Jews, and completely
          devastated the city of Salamis. For a punishment they were all
          banished from the island. The Acts of the Apostles mention the
          two seaports Salamis in the east, and Paphos; Soli, on the
          southern coast, had a sanctuary of Aphrodite and Isis; Citium
          was the birthplace of the Stoic Zeno.

    XI. The Province Cappadocia.

          In the year 17 A.D. Cappadocia, after the death of the last king
          Archelaus, was made a province, governed by a procurator who, as
          in Judea, was under the governor of the province of Syria in
          military matters. In the year 70 Vespasian united it with
          Galatia, but it was afterward again separated. Pontus Galaticus
          with Amasia and Pontus Polemoniacus, which had belonged to
          Galatia, Trajan joined to Cappadocia, to which was added Armenia
          Minor and Lycaonia with Iconium. Cappadocia had very few cities
          of importance. That Paul did no missionary work there is very
          intelligible; hence it is also improbable that he should have
          traveled through Cappadocia (Acts xviii, 23). The road would
          have brought him within three days from the Cilician gates to
          Tyana, the birthplace of Apollonius, a Roman colony after
          Caracalla; from thence perhaps to Mazaka-Eusebea, called
          Cæsarea, the most important and still flourishing city in
          Cappadocia, the metropolis of the province, the birthplace of
          Basil the Great. Nazianzus and Nyssa, the episcopal sees of the
          two Gregorys, were places of no importance.

   Asinarii
          ASINARII, as-i-nê´rî-ai: Originally a nickname of the Jews,
          because they were said to worship an ass (see [632]Ass);
          afterward applied also to the Christians, of whom the same story
          was told. It is not impossible that the Jews were the first to
          shift the reproach from themselves to the Christians. Tertullian
          (Ad nationes, i, 14; Apologia, xvi) tells how an apostate Jew,
          bitterly hostile to the Christians, exhibited in Carthage a
          picture representing a god with ass's ears and a hoof on one
          foot, clad in a toga and holding a book, with the inscription
          DEUS CHRISTIANORUM ONOKOIETES [" Onokoietes, the God of the
          Christians;" the meaning of " Onokoietes" is not very clear; it
          has been explained as " ass-priest" or " ass-worshiper" ;
          another reading is ONOKOITES, " lying in an ass's manger" (?);
          perhaps there is a ribald implication]. More offensive to the
          Christians was the " travesty crucifixion" which the Jesuit
          Garrucci discovered in 1856 in the ruins of a building on the
          southern declivity of the Palatine, which was possibly a school
          for the imperial pages. In that case it was probably sketched in
          an idle moment by one of these lads, in mockery of the religion
          of his Christian comrades. It represents a man's body with an
          ass's head, not strictly hanging on a cross, since the feet are
          supported by a platform, but with the arms outstretched and
          fastened to the transverse piece of a T-shaped cross. To the
          left is a smaller figure, raising one hand in an attitude of
          adoration, and under it is the inscription ALEXAMENOS SEBETE
          [i.e., sebetai] ThEON (" Alexamenos worships his god" ). It is
          now in the Museo Kircheriano in Rome.

          In 1870 Visconti discovered another inscription in the same
          building, with the words ALEXAMENOS FIDELIS. Both of these
          probably belong to the beginning of the third century. That
          there is nothing improbable in a Christian having been among the
          imperial pages at that time is shown by Tertullian (Apologia,
          xxxvii) and by an inscription of the year 217, given by Rossi.

   Asmodeus
          ASMODEUS, as´´mo-dî´Us (in the Talmud, Ashmedai): An " evil
          spirit," first mentioned in the apocryphal book of Tobit (iii,
          8), as loving Sara, the daughter of Raguel at Ecbatana, and
          causing the death of her seven successive husbands on the bridal
          night. But Tobias, the eighth, escaped, under the direction of
          Raphael, by burning " the ashes of the perfumes" with the heart
          and liver of a fish which he had caught in the Tigris. When
          Asmodeus smelled the fumes, he fled to Upper Egypt, and was
          bound there by Raphael (Tobit viii, 1-3). The figure of this
          demon is taken from the Persians who greatly influenced later
          Jewish angelology and demonology. He is Parsee in origin, and to
          be identified with Æshma of the Avesta, the impersonation of
          anger (the primary meaning) and rapine.

          Once adopted by the Jews, Asmodeus, thanks to rabbinic fancies,
          took on greater dimensions. Thus he is said to have been
          implicated in Noah's drunkenness and to be the offspring of the
          incest of Tubal-cain with his sister Naamah; he is reputed to
          have driven Solomon from his kingdom, but later Solomon forced
          him to serve in building the Temple, which he did noiselessly by
          means of the worm Shamir, whose whereabouts he revealed to
          Solomon.

   Aspersion with Holy Water
          ASPERSION WITH HOLY WATER: A rite of frequent use in the Roman
          Catholic Church. It has a place in the administration of baptism
          and extreme unction, in the nuptial blessing, and in the
          ceremonies of sepulture, as well as in the consecration of
          objects for divine worship and in blessings of all kinds.
          Persons entering or leaving a church make the sign of the cross
          with holy water. A solemn form of aspersion, practised in parish
          churches every Sunday before the high mass, is called the
          Asperges, from the first word of the antiphon usually intoned by
          the officiating priest. The explanation of the use of holy water
          in aspersions is found in the prayer said at the time when it is
          blessed,--that, wherever it is sprinkled, the invocation of
          God's name may drive away all evil spirits and every temptation,
          and that the Holy Spirit by his presence may comfort all who
          implore the divine mercy. See [634]Holy Water.

   Ass
          ASS: The wild ass (Heb. pere, poetic arodh; asinus onager or
          hemippus) is often mentioned in the Old Testament, and appears
          to have been found in earlier times more frequently in Syria
          than is now the case. It is described as dwelling in the
          wilderness (Isa. xxxii, 14; Jer. ii, 24); and to the poet it is
          a type of unbridled love of freedom (Job xi, 12, xxxix, 5-8),
          and a picture of the wandering Bedouin (Gen. xvi, 12; Job xxiv,
          6). Hosea (viii, 9) compares Ephraim wilfully running after
          Assyria, to a wild ass separated from the herd. It feeds on the
          vegetation of the salt steppe (Job vi, 5; Jer. xiv, 6). The
          animal is larger and more beautiful and graceful than the common
          ass; it is famous for its swiftness, and is hard to catch.

          The tame ass has been from ancient times one of the most
          important domestic animals in the East, whence it was introduced
          into Greece and Italy (cf. V. Hehn, Kulturpflanzen und
          Haustiere, Berlin, 1894, pp. 130-131). The Oriental ass is
          larger, quicker, more enduring, and more intelligent than the
          European. As in older times, the light-gray asses or white asses
          are still preferred, which the Sleb Bedouins rear in the desert;
          the usual color is reddish-brown (hence the name h?amor). All
          classes used them for riding, for which purpose the females were
          preferred (Num. xxii, 11; Judges x, 4; II Sam. xvii, 23, xix,
          26; I Kings xiii, 13; II Kings iv, 24; cf. Matt. xxi, 2-9). In
          the time of David, mules were used (II Sam. xiii, 29; xviii. 9;
          I Kings i, 33). The driver went alongside or behind (Judges xix,
          3; II Kings iv, 24). The ass was also used as a beast of burden
          (Gen. xlii, 26, xlix, 14; I Sam. xxv, 18; Neh. xiii, l5), for
          plowing (Deut. xxii, 10; Isa. xxx, 24, xxxii, 20), and for
          grinding. Being an unclean animal, it could not be sacrificed
          (Ex. xiii, 13, xxxiv, 20), nor could its flesh be eaten (but cf.
          II Kings vi, 25). With other nations, as the Egyptians, it was
          sacred, and with this may probably be connected the fable
          circulated by Greek and Roman writers that the Jews worshiped
          the ass as God (see [635]Asinarii).

   Ass, Feast of the
          ASS, FEAST OF THE: A popular entertainment provided by the
          Church in the Middle Ages in several cities of France. The aim,
          as in the miracle-plays, mysteries, moralities, and many minor
          points of the ritual, was to impress the facts of Bible history
          upon the minds of the ignorant, and to give general religious
          instruction. At Rouen a drama was presented at Christmas-tide,
          in which the prophets, Moses, Aaron, John the Baptist and his
          parents, Simeon, Nebuchadnezzar, Vergil, and the Sibyl appeared
          in appropriate dress and announced the coming of a redeemer. The
          story of Balaam was one of the scenes, and the ass was made to
          speak by the help of a priest concealed between the legs. At
          Beauvais a young woman with a child in her arms, and mounted on
          an ass, was led in procession through the streets on Jan. 14, in
          commemoration of the flight to Egypt. Mass was then said, during
          which "hinham" was substituted for certain of the usual
          responses. There was a similar festival at Sens, and an ass's
          feast at Madrid on Jan. 17, in the course of which the story of
          Balaam's ass was recited. In the fifteenth century these feasts
          were forbidden because abuse had crept in and they had become a
          scandal. The ass naturally figured frequently in Palm Sunday
          processions, and a picture of an ass was often introduced in the
          churches at that time. See [637]Boy-Bishop; [638]Fools, Feast
          of.

   Asseburg, Rosamunde Juliane von
          ASSEBURG, as´se-bUrg, ROSAMUNDE JULIANE VON: Religious
          enthusiast; b. at Eigenstedt, near Aschersleben (30 m. n.w. of
          Halle), Prussia, 1672; d. in Dresden Nov. 8, 1712. She might
          have been forgotten long ago, if the well-known millenarian,
          [639]Johann Wilhelm Petersen (q.v.), had not called attention to
          her, and been followed in the study of her case by such men as
          Spener, Löscher, and Leibnitz. According to her own statement,
          she received divine revelations and had glorious visions when
          only seven years old, and was regarded in the neighborhood of
          her home as an inspired prophetess. She asserted that Christ
          himself had appeared to her, and that an angel had received her
          tears in a golden vessel. At first these revelations were
          confided only to the circle of her friends; but they obtained
          wider currency when she removed to Magdeburg and became
          acquainted with Petersen who published a treatise on her case in
          1691, discussing the question whether God might be supposed
          still to reveal himself in direct apparitions. Löscher, at
          Dresden, and Johann Friedrich Meyer, at Hamburg, warned against
          believing her; Spener, asked for his opinion by the electress of
          Saxony, expressed himself with great caution; Leibnitz supported
          her, and compared her visions to those of St. Bridget and other
          holy women of the Middle Ages. Peterson received her at
          Lüneburg, where her mental excitement increased to such a degree
          as to cause disturbance in the town and to call for an official
          investigation. Petersen's deposition from the office of
          superintendent and banishment followed in 1692, and implied the
          condemnation of his friend. She followed him to Wolfenbüttel and
          to Magdeburg; later she lived in Berlin, and in the house of a
          Saxon countess, where Petersen used to call and visit her as
          late as the year 1708. It is said that she died in Dresden Nov.
          8, 1712, and was buried at Schönfeld near Pillnitz. Her poem
          euch gegeben, is included in some modern German hymn-books.

   Assemani
          ASSEMANII, as-sê-ma´nî (Italianized from the Arabic
          al-samaaniyy, "the Simeonite" ): The name of several learned
          Maronites who came to Rome from the Lebanon.

          1. Joseph Simonius Assemani: The oldest and best known; b. at
          Hasrun (35 m. n.e. of Beirut, near the cedar-grove at the foot
          of Jabal Makmat); d., eighty years old, at Rome Jan. 13, 1768.
          He was educated at the Maronite college in Rome, and is said to
          have learned thirty languages. In 1715 Pope Clement XI sent him
          to the East to look for manuscripts, and he was there again from
          1735 to 1738 in behalf of the Roman Catholic Christians of the
          Lebanon. He published numerous works, of which the first, and
          perhaps the most important, was the Bibliotheca orientalis
          Clementino-Vaticana in qua manuscriptos codices Syriacos,
          Arabicos, Persicos, Turcicos, Hebraicos, Samaritanos, Armenicos,
          Æthiopicos, Græcos, Ægyptiacos, Ibericos, et Malabaricos . . .
          bibliothecæ Vaticanæ addictos recensuit digessit J. S. Assemani.
          Twelve volumes were planned, of which four were published (Rome,
          1719-28). For Cardinal Quirini's edition of the works of Ephraem
          Syrus he prepared the three Greek volumes (1734-46), and in
          1751-53 issued four volumes of Italicæ historicæ scriptores, a
          supplement to Muratori; four more volumes were planned. Six
          volumes of Kalendaria ecclesiæ universæ appeared in 1755; six
          more were planned and partially completed, but were destroyed by
          fire in the Vatican library in 1768. The Bibliotheca juris
          orientalis canonici et civilis (5 vols., 1762-66) is now very
          rare. The archives of the Propaganda and of the Inquisition
          contain more than 100 volumes of treatises by Assemani. Many of
          the works which he planned should be taken up by organized
          scholarly research. A list of his manuscript remains is given in
          Mai, Nova collectio, ii, 2 (Rome, 1828), 166-168.

          2. Joseph Aloysius Assemani: A younger brother of the preceding;
          b. about 1710; d. at Rome Feb. 9, 1782. He was professor of
          Oriental languages in Rome. His chief work was Codex liturgicus
          ecclesiæ universæ in xv. libros distributus (13 vols., Rome,
          1749-66). Most copies of the last volume were burned, but it (as
          well as the entire work) is accessible in anastatic reprint.
          Besides minor dissertations, he published De catholicis seu
          patriarchis Chaldæorum et Nestorianorum commentarius
          historico-theologicus (1755). His Latin translation of the
          Collectio canonum of Ebed Jeau and of the Nomocanon of
          Barhebræus is in Mai, Nova collectio, vii (1838).

          3. Stephen Evodius Assemani: A cousin of the preceding two; b.
          1707; d. Nov. 24, 1782. He was titular bishop of Apamea and
          member of the Royal Society of Great Britain. He published
          Bibliothecæ Mediceæ Laurentianæ et Palatinæ codicum mss.
          orientalium catalogus (Florence, 1742), containing in
          twenty-three plates the illustrations of Bible history from the
          Syriac codex of Rabulas; the three Syriac volumes of the works
          of Ephraem Syrus in the edition mentioned above; Acta sanctorum
          martyrum orientalium et occidentalium in duas partes distributa:
          adcedunt acta S. Simeonis Stylitæ (2 vols., Rome, 1748); and
          with J. S. Assemani, Bibliothecæ apostolicæ Vaticanæ codicum
          manuscriptorum catalogus in tres partes distributus, of which 3
          volumes (Hebrew and Syriac manuscripts) had appeared (1756
          sqq.), as well as eighty pages of the fourth (Arabic
          manuscripts), when the fire in the Vatican library destroyed the
          remainder.

          4. Simon Assemani: A great-nephew of Joseph Simonius and Joseph
          Aloysius Aasemani; b. in Rome Feb. 19, 1752, according to G. P.
          Zabeo, Orazione in funere di Assemani (Padua, 1821); others say
          in Tripolis, and give the date as Feb. 20, 1752, and Mar. 14,
          1749; d. in Padua, where he was professor of Arabic, Apr. 7,
          1821. His publications were chiefly on Arabic subjects, as Museo
          cufico Naniana (Padua, 1788); Su la Setta Assissana (1806).

   Asser
          ASSER: Bishop of Sherborne; d. 909 or 910. He was a Briton, a
          monk of Menevia (St. David's), and related to the bishop of that
          see. His repute for learning was such that about 885 King Alfred
          asked him to enter his service, and an arrangement was
          ultimately made whereby the monkish scholar agreed to spend half
          of each year with the English king and half in his own home.
          Alfred gave him very substantial rewards, including a grant at
          Exeter and its district in Saxonland and Cornwall. He became
          bishop of Sherborne (in Dorsetshire) before 900. He wrote a life
          of Alfred (De rebus gestis Æifridi), which is a chronicle of
          English history from 849 to 887, with a personal and original
          narrative of Alfred's career to the latter year. It betrays the
          author's Celtic birth in many passages, and in existing
          manuscripts has been much interpolated. The best editions are by
          F. Wise (Oxford, 1722), in Petrie's Monumenta historica
          Britannica (London, 1848), and by W. H. Stevenson (Oxford, 1904,

   Assistants in Public Worship
          ASSISTANTS IN PUBLIC WORSHIP: The historical functions of those
          whose place it is to assist the principal minister in divine
          service belong largely to the development of the various orders
          (see [644]Orders, Holy). In the modern Roman Catholic Church the
          celebrant at high mass is assisted by a dean and subdeacon who
          are usually priests. The minor functions are performed by
          acolytes, usually laymen and boys. A priest is not allowed to
          celebrate even a low mass without at least one person to make
          the responses. In the Anglican prayer-book the clergymen who
          read the epistle and gospel are designated not deacon and
          subdean, but epistoler and gospeler. See also [645]Lay-Reader.

          Aug. 26, 1833. He was educated at the University of Breslau, and
          after his ordination to the priesthood in 1860 was assistant in
          Katscher from 1861 to 1864, and a mission priest and military
          chaplain in Kolberg in 1865-68. From the latter year until 1882
          he was divisional chaplain at Neisse, and was then provost of
          St. Hedwig's, Berlin, and delegate of the prince-bishop for six
          years. In 1882 he was consecrated titular bishop of
          Philadelphia, and since the same year has been field provost of
          the Prussian army and navy, being also the recipient of numerous
          orders and decorations.

   Assumption, Feast of the
          ASSUMPTION, FEAST OF THE: A festival of the Roman Catholic
          Church, commemorating the assumption, or corporal translation,
          of the Virgin Mary into heaven after her death. This doctrine,
          which the Greek Church also teaches (Synod of Jerusalem, 1672),
          has never been made the object of a dogmatic papal definition,
          but the attitude of the Church toward it and the general
          teaching of theologians class it among those truths which it
          would be rash to deny; at the Vatican Council over two hundred
          bishops desired a decree making the Assumption an article of
          faith. The Assumption can not be proved from Holy Scripture, and
          is based entirely upon tradition, though the scriptural
          prerogatives of Mary are invoked to prove the propriety of such
          an occurrence. About the year 600 the emperor Maurice ordered
          the celebration of the feast on Aug. 15; and at about the same
          time Gregory the Great fixed the same date for the West, where
          it had previously been observed on Jan. 18, for a reason which
          can not now be ascertained. The Gallican Church held to Jan. 18
          down to the ninth century. The most that can be said for the
          antiquity of the feast is that its general solemn observance in
          East and West at the end of the sixth century would seem to
          justify the belief that its beginnings date from at least a
          century earlier. The word "assumption," at one time applied
          generally to the death of saints, especially martyrs, and their
          entry into heaven, has come to have an exclusive application to
          the Blessed Virgin. See [648]Mary, the Mother of Jesus.

   Assumption,, Augustinians of the
          ASSUMPTION, AUGUSTINIANS OF THE (known popularly as
          Assumptionists): A religious congregation of men, founded at
          Nîmes in 1845 by Emmanuel d'Alzon (1810-80), and finally
          approved by the pope in 1864. The rule is that of St. Augustine,
          supplemented by special constitutions. The purpose of the
          society is the sanctification of its members, devotion to God,
          to the Blessed Virgin, and to the Church, and zeal for souls.
          The activity of the Assumptionists has been displayed in many
          fields. A large part of their energy has been devoted to the
          poor and working classes, in asylums, schools, and technical
          institutions. In 1864 the Little Sisters of the Assumption were
          organized to assist in this work, and later, to secure still
          more effectively the spiritual and material relief of the needy,
          three pious confraternities of laywomen were affiliated to the
          Oblates--the Servants of the Poor, the Sisterhood of Our Lady,
          and the Daughters of St. Monica. In 1863 Father d'Alzon was sent
          by Pius IX to Constantinople to take up missionary work, and
          to-day about 350 members of the society are laboring in Turkey,
          Bulgaria, Asia Minor, and Palestine, in schools, seminaries,
          hospitals, and general missionary work. The demands of this
          field led to the founding of the Oblate Sisters of the
          Assumption. Perhaps the best known work of the Assumptionists is
          the Oeuvre de la Bonne Presse for the dissemination of good
          literature. This undertaking which was attended by a remarkable
          degree of success, resulted in numerous newspapers and
          magazines, and almost countless other publications. La Croix du
          Dimanche had a circulation of 510,000. Dissolved by a decree of
          the Court of Appeal of Paris, Mar. 6, 1900, the Assumptionists
          were doomed to exile or dispersion, but still maintain their
          corporate existence, with a central house at Rome, and
          establishments in Belgium, Spain, Italy, England, Australia,
          Chile, and the United States. They count at the present time
          about 1,000 members. The habit is a black robe with long,
          flowing sleeves, a black cape and cowl, and a leathern cincture.

   Assurance
          ASSURANCE: The doctrine that those who are truly converted know
          beyond doubt that they are saved (cf. Col. ii, 2; Heb. vi, 11;
          x, 22).

          The doctrine may easily be made to contribute to spiritual
          pride. The degree of its objectionableness depends upon the
          interpretation placed upon it. It is particularly objectionable
          when it assumes to deny a state of salvation to those who are
          troubled by doubts, and in its exaggerated form easily leads to
          [649]Antinomianism (q.v.). The doctrine was taught by both
          Luther and Calvin, and has been generally held in Protestantism.
          Indeed, the Westminster Assembly was the first Protestant synod
          to declare assurance not to be of the essence of faith. In
          connection with the belief in unconditional election, the
          doctrine in Calvinism (cf. Westminster Confession, art. xviii)
          takes the form of assurance of final Salvation (see
          [650]Perseverance of the Saints). In Methodism it means full
          confidence of present, not eternal, salvation. In this form the
          doctrine was advocated by Wesley, who connected it with the
          witness of the Holy Spirit; and it is still generally held by
          Methodist theologians (see [651]Methodists).

  I. The Name.

          The original form seems to have been a-usar (" water-plain" ),
          which was assimilated to or confused with the name of the god
          Anshar (" Host of Heaven "), softened into Asshar, and Asshur.
          The country appears in both Assyrian and Hebrew as Asshur and
          "land of Asshur" ; to the Greeks it was Assyria; in the Aramaic
          the name became Athur and Athuriya.

  II. The Country.

    1. Geographical Position and Extent.

          In the case of a land the extent of which fluctuated so greatly
          at different periods, and the name of which connoted very
          different areas, some convention is necessary. Accordingly,
          following the datum of original size rather than of subsequent
          development, historians regard as Assyria that portion of
          territory lying along the Tigris, mainly to the east of it,
          north of the confluence of the Lower (or Little) Zab on the
          south to the foothills of the mountains of Armenia on the north,
          and on the east from the Zagros Mountains to just beyond the
          Tigris on the west. This demarcation coincides with a change in
          the topographical character of the country at its southern
          limit. Below the Lower Zab the country becomes alluvial; above
          that it is rolling or mountainous; while the desert lies to the
          west. Since this is in accord with native characteristics of the
          people to be noted later, for which it helps to account, the
          boundaries given above are assumed for this article.

    2. The Tigris.

          Topographically the Tigris is the chief feature, the character
          of which is best understood by comparison with the
          [652]Euphrates (q.v.). It rises only a few miles south of the
          course of the Euphrates and at about the same level, but on the
          south side of the mountains. The Euphrates, therefore, has to
          skirt the north side of the range and break through on its much
          longer journey south. The general course of the Tigris is quite
          consistently southeast; and the two rivers reach the same level
          about opposite Bagdad. The consequence is that to make the
          difference in level of about 1,000 feet between the source and
          the alluvium, the Tigris, having a much shorter distance to go,
          makes a more rapid descent than the Euphrates, sad its current
          is swifter. A second and noteworthy difference is that while the
          Euphrates receives only two important tributaries after turning
          south, the Tigris continues to receive all the way to its mouth
          streams which drain the mountain regions and basins to the east.
          While, therefore, the Euphrates loses much of its water to the
          thirsty soil through which it passes, the Tigris swells its
          torrent as it proceeds.

    3. Influence of Topography on History.

          Another characteristic of the country is its partial isolation.
          Mountains make it difficult of access from the north and east;
          and the desert does the same on the west. Its only easy approach
          is from the south by the rivers, where settled populations in
          ancient times guarded it from the nomadic hordes in that
          direction. Still one more note should be made. The country, is
          not alluvial like the great and marvelously fertile plain of
          Babylonia. It is rolling or hilly, harder therefore to
          cultivate, and, being more northerly in situation, its returns
          to the cultivator are less generous. All these facts have their
          bearing upon the character of the people. Further still, the
          land to the west of the river being prevailingly desert, the
          population of Assyria, was almost entirely to the east of it;
          and there, with a single exception, the great cities were
          situated.

    4. Climate, Fauna, and Minerals.

          In its temperature and its sufficiently abundant rainfall
          Assyria was fortunate: it was much cooler and moister than its
          southern neighbor. Of course, the temperature was lower in
          proportion to elevation and and to distance north. In the hills
          the winter were severe. The fauna was very extensive. In the
          earlier periods the elephant was known about the middle
          Euphrates. Of beasts of prey, there were the black-maned and
          another species of lion, the bear, panther, lynx, wild-cat,
          wolf, fox, jackal, and hyena. Of other animals, the porcupine,
          beaver, wild ass, wild boar, wild sheep, wild goat, ibex, gray
          deer, spotted deer, and hare may be named, while the great wild
          ox was not yet extinct. Of birds of prey or carrion, the eagle,
          vulture, and various hawks were known. Birds suitable for food
          were the bustard, swan, goose, duck, partridge, grouse, and
          plover. The common domestic animals were employed, while dogs
          were trained for the chase. The pine, poplar, plane, oak,
          sycamore, and walnut abounded. Under cultivation, though some of
          them were importations, were the date (of inferior quality),
          orange, lemon, pomegranate, apricot, mulberry, fig, and grape.
          Assyrian citrons were famous; melons were abundant; while
          cucumbers, onions, the grains--wheat, barley, and millet--and
          the leguminous plants were food staples. Under the careful and
          extensive system of irrigation in use, the agriculturist reaped
          a good return for his labors. Mineral resources were abundant
          and conveniently at hand in the shape of iron, lead, copper,
          alum, salt, and bitumen, while alabaster of a fine quality,
          limestone, and sandstone were in close proximity to the cities
          or easily reached from the Tigris, on which they were floated
          down to the places where they were required.

  III. Exploration and Excavation.

    1. The Persepolis Inscriptions.

          It may appear somewhat inconsequent that excavations in Assyria
          and Babylonia should be the result of the discovery and partial
          decipherment of inscriptions from a locality so distant as
          Persepolis. Yet the discovery that these were neither mere
          ornamentation nor arbitrary signs influenced greatly the patient
          toil and research which have recovered in large part the history
          of nations once forgotten, and have carried history back into
          the fifth pre-Christian millennium. The steps leading to these
          results are as follows. The ruins at Persepolis had been
          mentioned in 1320 by Odoric, and the inscriptions in 1611 by the
          friar Antonio de Gouvea; they were first described by the
          Spanish ambassador of Philip III to Shah Abbas, Don Garcia Sylva
          Figueroa, in 1621; the guess that they read from left to right
          was first made in 1677 by Thomas Herbert; they were first called
          cuneiform in 1700 by Thomas Hyde; first decided to be in three
          forms of writing in 1774 by Carsten Niebuhr; declared to be in
          three languages in 1798 by Olaf Tychsen; and first really
          translated, in part, in 1815 by Georg F. Grotefend, whose work
          was the climax which finally stimulated to direct effort upon
          Assyrian and Babylonian mounds. While discussion had been going
          on over the Persepolis inscriptions, bits of inscriptions in the
          cuneiform character had been collected by the surveyors who had
          been observing, locating, and plotting the mounds in Assyria and
          Babylonia. A relationship had been asserted between these scraps
          and the Persepolis writing; and Niebuhr had urgently advised
          excavation in Babylonia and had predicted rich results.

    2. Preliminary Exploration. Rich and Porter.

          The site of Nineveh had been correctly located as early as 1160
          by the rabbi Benjamin of Tudela. Desultory digging had been done
          in Babylonia at various sites by Claudius Rich of the East India
          Company, in some cases missing by only a foot or two walls which
          must have led him to investigate farther and have anticipated by
          over a quarter of a century the real discovery of the lost
          empires. That was in 1811; he visited Nineveh in 1820 and there
          turned up a few bricks with characters on them and bought others
          from the natives, all of which were sent home and found place in
          the British Museum. A visit of the artist and archeologist Sir
          R. K. Porter to the region, particularly to the mounds at Hillah
          in Babylonia, under the guidance of Rich, led to the publication
          in 1821-22 of a sumptuous work by Porter illustrated by his own
          brush. The interesting and even brilliant description of what
          was to be seen and inferred aroused anew the interest of Europe;
          so that the years which followed, as well as those which
          preceded his visit, were years of exploration. The sites of the
          mounds were visited and plotted and described until localities
          and names, with conjectures as to their history, became almost
          commonplace. The era of excavation, however, was still to come.

    3. Botta at Khorsabad.

          In 1842 a French consulate was established at Mosul, across the
          river from the site of Nineveh, and Paul Emil Botta was
          appointed consul. Botta had served in Egypt, Arabia, and Syria,
          and had so become well acquainted with the Arabs and their
          methods of working, as well as with French procedure in
          archeological investigation. He had met a German scholar named
          Julius Mohl, who had visited Babylonia and had been impressed
          with the opportunities which it was not in his power to grasp.
          By him Botta was urgently advised not to be content with mere
          explorations and plotting of sites, but to dig. Accordingly
          Botta at once began at Kouyunjik, but with results so scanty
          that he transferred his operations to Khorsabad, where speedily
          so large a number of bas-reliefs and well-preserved inscriptions
          were discovered in the uncovered palace of Sargon, that upon his
          sober report of the facts the French government made a grant of
          3,000 francs to continue the work. The local pasha meanwhile had
          procured an order for the cessation of the operations; but the
          arrival of a firman soon enabled Botta to resume, the result
          being the nucleus of the magnificent collection now in the
          Louvre, made between 1842 and 1846. In the latter year Botta was
          transferred, and his work as an excavator came to an end; but
          the results were published by the French government in five
          magnificent volumes which are even yet almost high-water mark.

    4. Layard and Rassam.

          While Botta, was engaged in digging, and after some of his
          successes had been gained, he was visited by Austen Henry
          Layard, whose early reading had given him a decided bent toward
          archeology. Layard told the story of the mounds to Lord
          Stratford, who had secured the Halicarnassus marbles for the
          British Museum; and in 1845 the latter made a contribution of
          £60 which Layard was to use in excavating. Layard returned to
          Mosul, kept his plans from the local pasha, and began excavating
          at Nimrud (Calah) at two different points. His first day's work
          led him into two chambers, belonging to two palaces, lined with
          alabaster slabs bearing inscriptions. Further effort resulted in
          the uncovering of colossi which created sensation first among
          his Arab laborers and then in England, in the latter case so
          pronounced that the apathetic British government made a
          parsimonious grant for the continuance of the work. The local
          pasha had closed the trenches; but authority from the Porte was
          obtained which overruled opposition. The palace of Shalmaneser
          II was excavated, and the black obelisk unearthed with its
          sunken panels of relief and its 210 lines of inscription and the
          mention of Jehu of Israel, along with many other inscriptions.
          Layard had the benefit of Hormuzd Rassam's skill in managing
          natives, since Rassam was himself of the country, but educated
          in England. In 1847 Kalah-Shergat was attacked; and among other
          finds was the great inscription of Tiglath-Pileser I. An
          interval of two years was employed partly in writing his first
          books, and then Layard returned as the agent of the British
          Museum and excavated at Nimrud, Kalah-Shergat, Nebi Yunus, and
          Kouyunjik, at the latter place uncovering Sennacherib's palace.
          In 1851 his transference to the diplomatic service at
          Constantinople brought his work as an excavator to an end. He
          had identified Calah and Nineveh, had discovered eight palaces,
          and had recovered part of the great royal library, many
          historical inscriptions, the great collection of seals and seal
          impressions, the great slab, 21 ft. by 16 ft. 7 in., the
          monolith and statue of Asshurnasirpal, and great numbers of
          bronze and copper vessels, implements, and arms. Meanwhile his
          books, written in most pleasing style and using with telling
          effect Biblical passages referring to Assyria and Babylon, had
          thoroughly awakened England to the importance of the operations.
          While his active work in digging creased, his diplomatic post
          afforded him the opportunity of facilitating the efforts of
          others by preventing much of the local bigoted and fanatical or
          avaricious obstruction which had impeded his own success.

    5. Rassam, 1852.

          In the year 1852 Rassam, who had contributed so much to Layard's
          success, was commissioned by the British Museum to continue the
          work of excavating, under the direction of Sir Henry Rawlinson.
          He unearthed at Kouyunjik the palace of Asshurbanipal with its "
          chamber of the lion hunt" and the record chamber with its heaps
          of inscribed tablets, including the Deluge Tablets, the richest
          discovery yet made. At Nimrud he found E-zida, the temple of
          Nebo, six statues of the god, the stele of Shamshi-Ramman IV,
          and the fragments of the black obelisk of Asshurbanipal II. At
          Kalah-Shergat the two intact prisms of Tiglath-Pileser I with
          their 811 lines of inscription were the prizes. His work was
          followed by that of Loftus and Boutcher, which produced less
          spectacular but equally solid values, while Hilmi Pasha, who had
          displaced the unscrupulous Mohammed Pasha, recovered at Nebi
          Yunus some winged bulls, a number of bas-reliefs, and other
          important material.

    6. Place.

          Meanwhile the French government had made an appropriation of
          70,000 francs, by which Victor Place was enabled during 1851-55
          to carry on investigations at Khorsabad and Kalah-Shergat. The
          plan of the former was thoroughly worked out, while fourteen
          cylinders, a magazine of pottery, another of glazed tiles, and
          the bakery and wine cellar of the palace were uncovered.
          Unfortunately the materials gathered by this expedition and the
          one of the same period at Birs Nimrud in Babylonia were lost by
          the capsizing of the raft on which they were being conveyed down
          the river for shipment.

    7. George Smith.

          The joint results of these labors being a mass of unread
          inscriptions, it is hardly surprising that a tacit understanding
          supervened to suspend excavations until decipherment should
          decide the value of the documents. Progress was rapid; Assyrian
          and Babylonian, Vannic and Sumerian yielded their secrets; and
          the reading of part of the material proved its great importance
          (see [653]Inscriptions). A new start was taken in the year 1872.
          George Smith had discovered among Rassam's tablets obtained from
          Asshurbanipal's palace the fragments of the deluge story. The
          possible, even certain, illumination of the Bible by these
          documents, guaranteed by the reading of the names of several of
          the Hebrew kings, stimulated to new effort. The popular demand
          became urgent for new discovery; yet the government's action was
          so tardy, under the restrictions of routine, that private
          enterprise was evoked and the London Daily Telegraph offered
          £1,000 to defray the expenses of an expedition, if Smith would
          lead it and send reports of progress. The start was made in
          January of 1873; Kouyunjik was the site chosen for work; and
          three new fragments of the deluge series were recovered, along
          with a number of historical inscriptions. With this success the
          Telegraph was satisfied and recalled Smith. The same year he was
          sent back by the British Museum, and secured some 3,000
          inscriptions, many of which filled gaps in the material already
          at hand. In 1875 he was again sent out; but Turkish opposition
          intervened, and when that had been overcome, his death had
          occurred.

    8. Rassam, 1877-82.

          During the period 1877-82 Rassam was the agent in the field; and
          he unearthed at Balawat (fifteen miles from Mosul) the beautiful
          bronze plates of the gates of Imgur-Bel, a city which was the
          site of a palace of Asshurnasirpal II. Kouyunjik was more
          thoroughly explored, 2,000 pieces, some of them exceedingly
          fine, being the reward. But the rich finds of previous years
          made these results seem meager; and the consequence was a
          cessation of excavation in Assyria which has not yet been
          resumed, the southern region of Babylonia being more promising
          and offering greater rewards.

    9. Obstacles in Excavating.

          The difficulties which have to be overcome by excavating
          archeologists in these regions are fourfold. (1) Financial. The
          French and German governments have established a fine record of
          support of scientific research; the record of the British is not
          so clear; the United States has done nothing, Consequently
          expeditions from the United States have to rely upon private
          enterprise. It is a pity that some great fund is not available
          that shall make appeal for special resources unnecessary: the
          result would be more thorough work and not the kind which looks
          for spectacular effects and leaves on the ground material as
          valuable as that recovered. (2) Governmental. This is in the
          shape either of refusal or delay, at the Sublime Porte, to grant
          permission to dig, or at the field in the case of bigoted or
          obstinate pashas. The only remedy in the former case is timely
          application supported by suitable diplomatic effort. If the
          pasha on the ground is inclined to interpose obstructions, the
          display of a firman should be sufficient. (3) Popular. The
          suspicion and superstition of the Arabs can be overcome only by
          the exercise of great patience and diplomacy. Their confidence
          once gained, the Arabs are loyal to their employers, as is amply
          proved by experience. The assistance of one trained in dealing
          with them is, however, a necessity. (4) Natural. The ruins of
          the country and of its system of irrigation, the resulting
          stretches of marshes with their miasmatic fevers, the heat of
          the sun, and the scorching winds and dust-storms, are obstacles
          which can not be overcome. Their effects may be palliated by
          proper precautions, which, unfortunately, the excavator too
          often neglects in the ardor of his pursuit of knowledge.

  IV. The Cities.

          According to the best reading of Gen. x, 11 (R. V. margin), "out
          of Shinar went forth Asshur, and builded Nineveh, Rehoboth-Ir,
          and Calah, and Resen." By excepting from these Rehoboth-Ir
          (which is now regarded as a mistake for Rehoboth-Nina, either
          the place where Mosul new is, or the "open places," i.e.,
          "squares," of Nineveh itself), and by adding Asshur, Arbela, and
          Dur-Sharrukin, a list of the known cities belonging to Assyria
          proper is completed.

    1. Asshur.

          Asshur, the modern Kalah-Shergat, on the west side of the
          Tigris, rather below the middle point of the places where the
          Upper and the Lower Zab join the Tigris, was the chief city of
          Assyria until the reign of Asshur-bel-kala, son of
          Tiglath-Pileser I, c. 1090 B.C. It never attained as frequent
          mention or description as Nineveh in contemporary records,
          though the inscriptions record the frequent rebuilding and
          repair of the great temple of Asshur which bore the name of
          E-karsag-kurkurra. That it was eclipsed by its rival Nineveh is
          due perhaps to two causes: (1) The more healthful and pleasant
          situation of the latter; and (2) The location of Asshur in the
          zone of danger from Babylonian attack. But the return of quite
          late kings to it as their capital shows the hold the old city
          had upon the sentimental regard of those rulers.

    2. Nineveh.

          Nineveh (Assyr. Nina or Ninua; Hebr. Ninweh or Nineweh; LXX,
          Nineui), the modern Kouyunjik on the north and Nebbi Yunus on
          the south of the Choser, named probably, like the southern city
          of the same name, from Nin, daughter of Ea and identified with
          Ishtar of Nineveh, stood on the left bank of the Tigris, about
          twenty miles north of the confluence of the Upper Zab with the
          Tigris. Its walls enclosed about 1,800 acres, and were about
          seven and one-half miles in circumference (approximately two
          miles square), Herodotus describes them as being 380 feet high
          and 80 feet thick, though in all probability the height given is
          an exaggeration; but Layard's plans make them, at one of the
          principal gates, where they were doubtless reinforced, 110 feet
          thick. The gates were flanked with towers for their defense. The
          eastern wall was protected by a moat filled with water from the
          Choser. The time and circumstances of the founding of the city
          are unknown, though its Semitic origin seems implied by its
          name. The last datum is not quite conclusive, since it might
          have been pre-Semitic and renamed by its Semitic possessors. As
          it lay on the Indo-Mediterranean caravan route, its early origin
          and importance are assured. Gudea (see [654]Babylonia, VI, 3,
          § 3) left an inscription referring to the building of a temple
          in Nineveh which may (and probably does) refer to the Babylonian
          city. Similarly precarious is the identification of the Assyrian
          Nineveh with the one mentioned by Dungi, second king of Ur
          (c.2700 B.C.), as the place where he built a temple to Nergal.
          The fact that Shalmaneser I made gifts to such a temple in
          Nineveh does not, considering the diffusion of the worship of
          Nergal, make the identification secure. The conjecture of
          Jeremias that it once belonged to a kingdom called Kisshati has
          little to support it. About 1450 B.C. it was possibly under
          control of the (Hittite?) state of Mitanni, since Tushratta,
          king of Mitanni, lent an image of Ishtar of Nineveh to the
          contemporary Pharaoh. It is named twice in the [655]Amarna
          Tablets (q.v.), both times in connection with Ishtar. The first
          Assyrian who made his residence there was Asshur-bel-kala,
          mentioned above. It was neglected for a number of centuries, and
          finally under Sennacherib was made perhaps the richest and best
          adorned city of the times. He tore down the old palace and built
          a double one, one part in the Assyrian style and one in the
          Syrian. He also conducted thither a water-supply drawn from the
          upper reaches of the Choser. Esarhaddon and Asshurbanipal added
          great structures, and it became the foremost city of the world,
          a great center of commerce and enormous wealth. Under the
          last-named king, it became a repository also of Babylonian
          culture.

    3. Calah.

          Calah (Assyr. Kalh?u) was the city next in importance, really a
          suburb of Nineveh, twenty miles south, in the fork of the Upper
          Zab and the Tigris. It was apparently founded by Shalmaneser I
          (c. 1300 B.C.) and used as his capital in place of Asshur. It
          was then neglected until the time of Asshurnasirpal (c. 880
          B.C.), who rebuilt it, fortified it with a massive wall, brought
          a water-supply from the Zab, and made of it a garden city,
          adorned with foreign trees and shrubbery. His palace was one of
          great beauty, and the bas-reliefs found there by Layard, George
          Smith, and Rassam are in the British Museum. Shalmaneser II
          built another palace, one of the adornments of which was the
          famous Black Obelisk; and this palace was occupied also by
          Tiglath-Pileser III. Esarhaddon destroyed it and used the
          materials to construct his own palace. For these different
          structures a great platform was built of bricks and faced with
          stone, forty feet high, to guard against floods.

    4. Resen, Arbela, and Dur-Sharrukin.

          Of Resen (" fountain-source" ) little is known except its
          location between Nineveh and Calah, and that it is identified
          with the Larissa of Xenophon's Anabasia (III, iv, 7). Arbela ("
          [The City of the] Four Gods" ), the modern Erbil, is never
          noticed in the early inscriptions, yet must have had an
          important though quiet life, and long outlived its more
          pretentious and magnificent sister cities. It was situated in
          the mountains between the Upper and Lower Zab, and was the seat
          of worship of one of the Ishtars, next in prominence to her of
          Nineveh. Dur-Sharrukin (" Sargon's Fort" ), the modern
          Khorsabad, the site of the palace of Sargon (707 B.C.) and of
          the necessary adjuncts thereto, was north of Nineveh, near the
          sources of the Choser and on the slopes of the hills. It was
          much smaller than the capital, its walls being 3,820 yards in
          circumference. Two mountain streams flowed past it. Only in
          Sargon's time did it have much importance.

  V. The People, Language, and Culture.

    1. National Character.

          The people belonged to the so-called Northern Semites, and were
          related consequently most closely to the Semitic Babylonians,
          Arameans, Hebrews, and Phenicians. They were sturdy in physique,
          and their physiognomy, clearly portrayed in their many
          bas-reliefs, is of a pronounced Semitic type. Their character is
          traceable partly to their origin, partly to their environment.
          Their isolation preserved or intensified their native qualities,
          and prohibited the mellowing influences of contact with other
          peoples as well as the toleration which comes with admixture of
          blood. Their country was less attractive to marauders, besides
          being out of the beaten track of the migrations. The
          mountaineers to the east and north served as buffers against the
          great waves from the northeast, until they were subdued or
          denationalized by forced colonization. Thus, in contrast with
          the Babylonians, who became a much mixed people, the Assyrians
          preserved the purity of their race and consequently its
          primitive characteristics, among them that of fierceness (Isa.
          xxxiii, 19). This quality of a new people is illustrated in the
          case of two other Semitic peoples. The ferocity of the Chaldeans
          (c. 600 B.C.) is attributable to the fact that they, too, were a
          "new people," only recently from their Arabian habitat; and the
          fanaticism of the Mohammedan hosts is a matter of history, due
          not merely to religious causes. The isolation of the Assyrians
          is in nothing more remarkably illustrated than in the fact that
          their literature was of late importation from the south,
          subsequent to their great military operations, much of it in the
          days of Asshurbanipal (669-626 B.C.). Another trait of this
          people is a national self-consciousness lacking to most Semites.
          The larger cities of Assyria do not appear as self-governing
          units bearing impatiently the sway of the overlord. Assyria
          appears almost without exception as united; and the exceptions
          come from dissensions in the royal family in disputes about the
          succession.

    2. Occupations.

          The occupations of the people are largely included in the two
          words "war" and "commerce." The early Assyrian contract tablets
          found in Cappadocia bear testimony to a commercial enterprise
          which prophesied of the wars of the future. It has been
          correctly concluded by several historians that the object of
          campaigns was not alone extension of territory, but that
          security and enlargement of trading operations had their part in
          the purposes of the warring kings. This finds warrant not so
          much in the express words of the inscriptions as in indirect
          hints such as are found in the [656]Amarna Tablets (q.v.) and in
          the usages of the times as represented by Ahab and Ben-hadad (I
          Kings xx, 34). Of other occupations, agriculture has already
          been assumed (see [657]II, § 4, above), as also the handicrafts
          in the mention of the metals. Casting was known, and there has
          been found a mold for arrow-heads of accurate construction, in
          four parts, in which three heads could be cast at the same time.
          The representations of siege operations show ingenuity in the
          mechanical construction of implements of offensive warfare.

    3. Language.

          The language belongs also to the North Semitic group, and is
          very close to the Babylonian, differing only dialectically. The
          expression of it in the cuneiform was inherited directly from
          the Babylonians, indirectly from the pre-Semitic inhabitants of
          Babylonia, but developing as a consequence of the fact that
          writing is the expression of a living force, speech.

    4. The Culture not Native.

          The culture of Assyria was borrowed. In nothing is this clearer
          than in their methods of building. Although they lived in a land
          where stone was easily procured, the principal building material
          was sun-dried brick, in the more pretentious structures faced
          with burnt brick and sometimes with stone. Even the choice of
          sites, near the rivers where platforms had to be erected to
          avoid floods, was probably due to early habit acquired in
          Babylonia or imitated. To this method and material of building
          were due the constant repetition of building operations on the
          great temple structures and the narratives of the same in the
          annals of both countries. Roof-making was, from a structural
          point of view, evidently most imperfectly developed. When once
          the roof was broken, and the elements had access to the unburnt
          brick, swift collapse of a structure was inevitable. Yet to this
          very fact in most cases is attributable the preservation of the
          libraries and records unearthed; for the superincumbent clay
          sealed hermetically the chambers used as repositories. In the
          way of literature nothing creative appears to have come from the
          Assyrians except the mere narratives of the campaigns. The
          tablets containing the portions of the epics are knows to be
          copies from the south. The elegant style of Asshurbanipal's
          annals suggests that the formative period of Assyrian literature
          was just beginning, but the speedy collapse of the empire
          prevented any ripening into creative work.

  VI. The History.

    1. Chronology.

    Sources and Results

          The crucial datum is the mention of an eclipse in the eponymate
          of Pur-shagali in the month Sivan (May-June). A total eclipse
          occurred at Nineveh, June 15, 763 B.C., thus fixing the year of
          Pur-shagali's eponymate. The bearing of this on Assyrian
          chronology appears below. Other data are afforded by the Eponym
          Canon, found in the library of Asshurbanipal, a sort of calendar
          in which succeeding years are named respectively for officers of
          state. There are several sets of these, all incomplete, but
          often overlapping each other, and in these synchronistic parts
          showing that they are not replicas of each other, but in some
          cases independent documents. They cover consecutively the period
          902-667 B.C. and give the succession of the kings as well as of
          the eponyms, often including a short statement of the principal
          events of the year. In a succession like this, if the date of
          one is fixed, that of the rest follows; the eclipse just
          mentioned furnishes the desired fixed date. On these two sets of
          data hangs nearly all of Assyrian and Babylonian chronology, as
          well as that of some of the contemporary nations. The Canon of
          Ptolemy (Greek), is an appendix to the astronomical work of
          Claudius Ptolemæus, based on solar and lunar eclipses and using
          Babylonian sources. This was successfully employed to indicate
          the order in which the Eponym Canon should be arranged. The
          Synchronistic History of Babylonia and Assyria (cuneiform) gives
          an enumeration of Babylonian kings and contemporary Assyrian
          monarchs, and covers the periods 1400-1050 and 900-800 B.C. The
          Babylonian Chronicle (cuneiform) covers the period 744-668 B.C.,
          during the Assyrian dominance, and therefore throws light on
          Assyrian chronology or corroborates results otherwise obtained.
          For the early periods dependence must be placed upon isolated
          data. Thus, Sennacherib, in the rock inscription at Bavian
          (Schrader, KB, ii, 116 sqq.) alleges that he restored to the
          temple E-kallati images carried off to Babylon by
          Marduk-nadin-ahi 418 years earlier in the days of
          Tiglath-Pileser I. This is practically corroborated by the
          Babylonian king's statement that in his tenth regnal year he
          gained a victory over Assyria. The date of restoration was 689
          B.C., putting the date when the images were carried off at 1107
          B.C., making the coronation year of the Babylonian 1117 B.C.,
          and establishing the contemporaneity of the kings. Sennacherib
          mentions another fact which (though in round numbers and
          therefore slightly suspicious) places Tiglath-Nindar (or Ninib),
          son of Shalmaneser I, about the year 1289 B.C. Similarly,
          Tiglath_Pileser. I (dated above) records a fact which places the
          death of his great-grandfather Asshur-Dan c. 1175 B.C. He also
          gives the date of the rebuilding of a temple by the patesi (see
          [658]Babylonia) Shamshi-Ramman as 641 years earlier, thus
          placing the latter c. 1815 B.C. Further data are obtained by
          mention of the ancestors of different monarchs. When
          Ramman-Nirari calls himself son of Pud-il, grandson of
          Bel-nirari, great-grandson of Asshur-Uballit, he serves a useful
          purpose by naming a succession of four kings. Tiglath-Pileser I
          announces that the Shamshi-Ramman whom he dates was son of
          Ishmi-Dagan, and that both were patesis of Assyria. This datum
          shows also that in their time Assyria was not independent, since
          patesi is not the title of an independent ruler. These data give
          results upon which in most cases agreement is reached by
          scholars within the margin of a year.

    2. Ethnological Data

    1. Peoples and Places Named in Assyrian Annals.

          Gutium (Assyr. Kutu) was situated northeast from Nineveh, and
          stretched from the headwaters of the UpperZab to Lake Urumiah.
          It is probably referred to in Gen. xiv. The Namri occupied the
          southern part of the Zagros mountain range, between Media and
          Assyria, east of the Lower Zab. The Madai and Manda, later known
          as the Umman-Manda, were Aryan tribes beyond the Namri to the
          east of the mountains and toward the Caspian. The Kasshi,
          sometimes confused in the Old Testament (the unpointed Hebrew is
          the same) with Cush (Ethiopia), were northeastern neighbors of
          the Elamites and gave a long-lived dynasty to Babylonia. The
          Kaldu, later known as the Chaldeans, occupied the territory
          north and west of the head of the Persian Gulf and became rulers
          of Babylonia when the Assyrian empire fell. The Manni or Minni
          inhabited the territory between lakes Van and Urumiah, and were
          sturdy foes of the Assyrians. The Urartu or Armenians dwelt in
          the Armenian mountains and valleys northwest of Lake Van, and
          partly controlled the plains at the foot. They were perhaps the
          most difficult foes the Assyrians had to meet. The Mitanni,
          during the rise of Assyria, held Upper Mesopotamia c. 1400 B.C.,
          and are supposed to have been a Hittite power. By their position
          they controlled the trade route between the Upper Tigris, the
          Mediterranean, and the West. Gozan, later Gauzanitis, was a
          district on the upper waters of the Chabur. Bit-Adini was the
          Aramean state north of the confluence of the Chabur with the
          Euphrates. Kummuh? was a state considerably to the north of
          Bit-Adini on the southern spurs of the Taurus Mountains. In the
          northeastern part of Syria, north of where Antioch was situated
          later, not quite contemporary with each other were the Aramean
          states of Patin, Unki, Samal, Gurgum, and Yaudi--the latter for
          many years mistaken by Assyriologists for Judah, particularly as
          it had a king named Azriyahu nearly contemporary with Azariah of
          Judah. It lay between Samal and Unki (cf. Winckler,
          Altorientalische Forschungen, i, 1893). Kue was the name of the
          eastern part of the coast of Cilicia. Northeast from Kue was the
          Muzri of Asia Minor (confused in I Kings x, 28 and II Kings vii,
          6 with Egypt, though mentioned in connection with Syria and the
          Hittites in both passages; in the former Passage the name Kue is
          perhaps concealed in the word ma-koh). Still farther to the
          north were the Mushke, known to the Greeks as Moschi The
          Phenicians, the Syrians of Aleppo, Hamath, Arpad, and Damascus
          are all frequently mentioned in the inscriptions, as are the
          Hebrew kingdoms, Edom, Moab, Ammon, and Philistia. Arabia was
          known as Arabi, Arubu, and Aribi. In North Arabia the cuneiform
          makes known a district called Murz?i or Mizr, also mistaken in
          the Hebrew of I Kings xi, 17, for Miz?raim, Egypt. It was
          subdued by Tiglath-Pileser III. South Arabian inscriptions also
          name the locality. In the same region was a district called
          Cush, sometimes confused with Ethiopia. Meluh?h?a, the Main of
          the Old Testament, was in North Arabia. Saba, the Sheba of I
          Kings x, 1, Minaea, rediscovered by Glaser, and Yaman, probably
          the modern Yemen, are all noted in the annals of the kings.
          Northeast Arabia was known as Magan.

    3. The Story of Assyria

    1. Early History and Names, to 1500 B.C.

          The history of Assyria before 1800 B.C. is veiled. Gen. x, 11
          (R. V. margin) affirms the Babylonian background of this people,
          and all evidence from archeology, language, and cultural,
          remains, supports the affirmation. The date of colonization is
          unknown, but it was before 2300 B.C. Asshur was the first city.
          The connection with the parent country was close c. 2000 B.C.
          Hammurabi of Babylon (c. 2250 B.C.) had Assyrian soldiers in his
          army. No ruler earlier than Ishmi-Dagan (c. 1850 B.C.) is known,
          and he bore the title of patesi (or isshaku), a term that
          implied political dependence: In the time of his son,
          Shamshi-Ramman, Nineveh was already in existence; for he
          restored a temple of Ishtar there. Between his time and that of
          Asshur-bel-nisheshu only a few names are known. Igur-kapkapu (or
          Bel-kapkapu or Bel-bani) and his son Shamshi-Ramman II, Kallu
          and his son Irishum are all, but of the first it is known that a
          tablet exists dated in his reign, and (from it) that he bore the
          title of king. Assyrian contract tablets belonging to the period
          1800-1500 B.C. have been found in Cappadocia, indicating
          commercial, and perhaps a beginning of territorial, expansion.
          At the time when Thothmes III of Egypt was most active, the
          Assyrian king sent him a gift of " a great stone of
          lapis-lazuli" which Thothmes interpreted as a sign of
          submission, and so recorded it. If Assyria really feared Egypt,
          that fear did not last long, for the Hittites were soon active,
          and Egyptian aggression did not threaten the Tigris.

    2. The Winning of Independence, 1500-1300 B.C.

          The independence of Assyria, won soon afterward, was due, not to
          Assyria's strength, but to the weakness of the parent power.
          Internal strife gave the Kasshites the opportunity to conquer
          Babylonia, but they were too busy cementing their own power to
          attack Assyria, and the boundary was settled under
          Asshur-bel-nisheshu and Puzu-Asshur in treaties to which the
          Kasshite Karaindash of Babylon was one of the parties. This
          implies independence. About 1400 B.C., fifty years later, the
          Babylonian Burnaburiash claimed Assyria for his territory. The
          probable dependence of Nineveh upon Tushratta of Mitanni has
          been noted above ([659]IV, § 2). Assur-uballit wrote to
          Amenophis IV as an independent monarch; and indeed the claim of
          Assyria to Babylon began in the same reign. The Assyrian's
          daughter had married Kara-kardash of Babylon, and the latter's
          son had succeeded his father and then been murdered by his
          subjects Asahur-uballit intervened, subjected Babylon, and
          placed another grandson on the throne In the same reign and the
          next the Assyrian arms were carried to the borders of Elam,
          which led to war between Kurigalzu II of Babylon and Bel-nirari
          in which the northern cause was successful. Ramman-nirari I (c.
          1345-30 B.C.) reconquered the lands already overrun, and located
          cities for their government. He extended his sway beyond the
          Euphrates, and had a successful essay against Mitanni. New
          troubles with Babylonia arose over the conquest of Gutium; both
          sides claimed the victory, but the Assyrian boundary was
          advanced. Ramman's inscription is the earliest one of Assyria
          that is dated, and in it he calls himself king, not of Asshur,
          but of Kisshati, " the world."

    3. Shalmaneser I-Tiglath-Pileser I, 1300-1100 B.C.

          Shalmaneser I (c. 1300 B.C.) left on his successors an
          impression of greatness. He crossed the Euphrates and pushed his
          conquests as far as Muz?ri, which probably means that the
          territory up to the river at least was added to Assyrian
          territory. Asshur was abandoned as the capital, and Calah was
          built. The temple of Ishtar at Nineveh was also reconstructed,
          and Harran was added to the possessions of the king.
          Shalmaneser's son, Tiglath-Ninib, invaded Babylonia, captured
          and plundered Babylon, partly destroyed the wall, carried north
          with him the image of Marduk, governed the south from his own
          capital, and assumed the titles borne by Sargon the Great (see
          [660]Babylonia), king of Sumer and Akkad, as well as of Kisshati
          and Asshur. But he could not sustain himself, and lost his life
          in a rebellion headed by his son. For a time the Assyrian star
          declined. It is very likely that to this decline the Hittites
          had contributed; for the dash to the Mediterranean must have
          aroused them and certainly have included in its scope some of
          their cities. The Babylonians became the aggressors, and the
          next king, Asshurnasirpal I had difficulty in repelling them.
          Under the next four reigns Assyria's territory shrank to about
          its original extent. Then Assur-Dan I (c. 1210-1181 B.C.) began
          to regain territory south of the Lower Zab. His grandson,
          Asshur-rish-ishi, cleared the way to Babylon by conquering foes
          on the southeast, and then defeated Nebuchadrezzar I of Babylon.
          He rebuilt the Ishtar-temple in Calah. With Tiglath-Pileser I
          began a new era for Assyria. The celebrated eight-sided prism
          contains a part of his record. That full information of his
          predecessors' activity is not at hand is shown by his having in
          the very beginning of his reign to subdue people so distant as
          the Mushke. He won a victory over them among their hills,
          destroyed 14,000 out of the 20,000 engaged, and pursued the plan
          of subduing the territory by destroying the fighting forces.
          Tribute was exacted from the rest. During the next three years
          he carried his arms into the mountain regions northeast,
          northwest, and southeast with the uniform result of success and
          immense booty A confederation of twenty-three kings from the
          neighborhood of Lake Van was overcome, and heavy tribute
          imposed. Muzri was once more subdued, and Babylonia had to
          submit. At the end of his fifth year Tiglath-Pileser claimed to
          have subdued " forty-two countries with their rulers." Mention
          of the Hittites first occurs in his reign.

    Semitic Rule Unstable.

          At this point it is well to note, in explanation of the
          preceding and of much that follows, a characteristic of early
          Semitic rule. Constant reconquest of subjected territory was
          necessary The order of events was: subjection and a light
          tribute if submission had been ready, a heavy one if strong
          opposition had been offered; this was invariably followed by
          rebellion at the first seeming opportunity, and a change in the
          ruler was always considered an opportunity; then new subjection
          and a heavier tribute; when rebellion again arose, the case of
          the rebels was desperate, and further revolt was eliminated by
          almost complete desolation of the refractory territory. The
          creation of an empire by unifying peoples under a beneficent
          rule had not yet been conceived. On the other side was the
          inherent tendency to segregation, which was a characteristic of
          the Semites. An invader could reduce city after city, throwing
          against it the force of his united army, while other cities
          awaited their fate in trembling. Confederations invariably fell
          apart. Assyria was the one Semitic power thoroughly unified; and
          this unity was the cause of its victorious progress until the
          wars of centuries had sapped its strength.

    5. A Time of Quiescence, 1100-950 B.C.

          Tiglath-Pileser's activities were not all warlike; he rebuilt
          Asshur, restored its temples and palaces, and fostered
          agriculture and arboriculture. He was followed by two of his
          sons in succession, who removed the capital to Nineveh once
          more, restoring its great Ishtar-temple. A new period of
          quiescence or of exhaustion for Assyria had come, and its
          enemies organized themselves for new resistance. This resistance
          coincides with that of the expansion of the Hebrew kingdom. The
          Arameans had settled in Mesopotamia and fallen heir to the
          Hittite possessions including Hamath, Aleppo, and Damascus. They
          were traders, and, holding the caravan routes, directly menaced
          Assyrian commerce. The Phenicians, too, had been making of their
          cities strong fortresses. Between Tiglath-Pileser I and II were
          several rulers whose names are known and little else, while
          there is also a gap in the known succession. But the period was
          not the time of entire weakness generally supposed; the outburst
          of vigor which followed and continued with little intermission
          for three and one-half centuries proves it a time of development
          of power which was used in a series of campaign, which have not
          ceased to astonish since knowledge of them has been regained.

    6. Tiglath-Pileser II, 950 B.C.-Asshurnasirpal III, 885-860 B.C.

          Tiglath-Pileser II (c. 950 B.C.) began a succession of kings,
          all of whose names are known, though of what either he or his
          son Asshur-Dan II (C. 930 B.C.) did, little is certain. During
          the next reign, that of Ramman-nirari II (911-891 B.C.), the
          struggle with Babylonia was renewed, the latter losing territory
          to its opponent. Tiglath-Ninib (890-885 B.C.) placed under
          tribute the highlands of the north from Urumiah to the
          Mediterranean. Asshurnasirpal III (885-880 B.C.), son of the
          foregoing, carried forward the work of conquest. One of the
          finest inscriptions extant is his, on alabaster in 389 lines,
          corroborated by other texts. His first campaign in Armenia was
          so savage that with a single exception, severely punished, all
          tribes in his line of march hastened to submit. While on a
          campaign against Kummuh, he heard of the rebellion of an Aramean
          community at Bit-Kalupe on the Euphrates. He at once
          countermarched, took and plundered the city, cut off the legs of
          the officers engaged in the rebellion, flayed the nobles and
          stretched their skins on a pile built for the purpose, and sent
          the rebel governor to Nineveh to be flayed. The result was
          immediate submission of the district and of all in his line of
          march. While he was thus engaged in the west, rebellion broke
          out in the east and southeast, was crushed, broke out again, and
          was again put down with plundering, devastation, and slaughter.
          Sedition among the Arameans, fomented and assisted by
          Nabupaliddin of Babylonia, was overcome, and Suru, the capital,
          destroyed. The fomenter of the trouble in turn found work in
          repelling the Aramean hordes and occupation in rebuilding the
          temple of Shamash at Sippar. Continued rebellion among the
          Arameans revealed the fact that the little state of Bit-Adini,
          the Bene-Edhen of II Kings xix, 12, was the cause of the rising.
          This the Assyrians assailed and destroyed, and showed that they
          would permit no strong state on the Euphrates. The Mediterranean
          coast was next visited; tribute was received from the
          Phenicians; wood was gathered for the new works at Calah; and a
          memorial was left on the rocks at Nahr-el-Kalb (near Beirut).
          Asshurnasirpal made the Assyrian name a synonym for ferocity and
          savagery. Yet war was not his whole occupation. Calah had fallen
          into ruins while Asshur had been the capital. He rebuilt it,
          erected there a great palace, and conducted to the city a
          water-supply from the Lower Zab.

    7.Shalmaneser II, 860-824 B.C.

          With Shalmaneser II (860-824 B.C.) began contact of the
          Assyrians with the Hebrews. In the Black Obelisk and the
          Monolith texts this king has left some of the finest
          inscriptions known. These with supplementary records show a
          personal leadership by the king of his armies for twenty-six
          consecutive years. Under him began that battering at the gates
          of Damascus which continued from his time till the city fell in
          732 B.C., and then was directed against the Hebrews, Arabs, and
          Egyptians till about 660 B.C. The three prominent Syrian powers
          at the time were centered at Hamath, Patin, and Damascus. A
          coalition of these with their allies, including Israelites (Ahab
          furnished a contingent of 2,000 [?] chariots and 10,000 men),
          Arabs, and Ammonites, was met and defeated at Karkar. The
          quality of the victory claimed by Shalmaneser is doubtful, since
          in three inscriptions (the Black Obelisk, Monolith, and Bull;
          cf. Schrader, Keilschriftforschung, p. 47) the number of killed
          varies from 14,000 to 25,000, and no statement is made of
          tribute imposed. The victory was barren. There was revealed here
          a force which might have stayed the advance of Assyria could it
          have been held together. Six campaigns were made in this region
          during 854-839 B.C., none decisive in itself, but contributing
          in the end to the isolation of Damascus. Jehu of Israel sent
          tribute to divert from himself the attacks of Damascus. With
          reference to his campaigns in Armenia, Shalmaneser describes
          himself as " trampling down the country like a wild bull." But
          there, too, results were indecisive, and the region remained a
          menace to the dominant power. Media was invaded in a mere
          booty-snatching expedition. Internal conflict in Babylonia
          resulted in the reestablishment of Assyrian power there, and in
          checking the northward march of the Kaldu. The later years of
          the king were harassed by rebellions at home, led in one case by
          his sons, and due in part probably to utter weariness at the
          constant drain caused by the perpetual wars.

    8. Shamshi-Ramman IV and his Successors, 824-745 B.C.

          This legacy of civil war was left to the son Shamshi-Ramman IV
          (824-812 B.C.), who used two years in defeating his brother and
          in repressing the general rebellion of the provinces. A
          coalition of Babylonians, Elamites, Southern Arameans, and Kaldu
          was met and defeated and quiet restored after two campaigns.
          Payment of tribute was forced in different regions only by the
          presence of the army. His son, Ramman-nirari III (812-783 B.C.),
          who called himself a descendant of Igur-(Bel-)kapkapu, reduced
          Damascus to tributary relationship. The entire eastern coast of
          the Mediterranean contributed to his exchequer. A series of
          eight campaigns against the Medes took this king to the Caspian,
          and the south to the Persian Gulf was tributary. He made an
          attempt to weld religiously Babylonia and Assyria by the
          introduction of Babylonian cults into Nineveh, while Babylonia
          was treated as an Assyrian province. With the next king,
          Shalmaneser III (783-773 B.C.), began a period of decadence
          which continued for three reigns. Campaigns to enforce payment
          of tribute are mentioned, but Armenia in the mean time gained in
          power. Under Asshur-Dan III (773-755 B.C.) the story of
          rebellion and disaster grows. The eclipse of the sun, 763 B.C.,
          and pestilence in 759 and 754 were events of this reign.
          Asshur-nirari II (755-745 B.C.) left fewer notices, but enough
          to make evident that warlike attempts were not altogether
          discontinued. In an uprising at Calah he disappeared, and with
          him the dynasty which had ruled at least since Tiglath-Pileser
          II.

    9. Tiglath-Pileser III, 745-727 B.C.

          Under the great Tiglath-Pileser III (745-727 B.C.), the Pul of
          II Kings xv, 19, Assyria recovered at a bound her greatest
          former eminence and surpassed it. The origin of the new king is
          unknown, for in his numerous inscriptions he never mentions his
          ancestry. His vigor and boldness of conception and swiftness of
          execution were unparalleled even in Assyrian history. Babylonia,
          during the period of Assyria's weakness, had been unable to take
          advantage of relief from pressure, owing to attacks by the
          Arameans. Tiglath-Pileser invaded the country, repelled the
          Arameans, reorganized the government, and conciliated the
          inhabitants by paying homage to the chief deities. The districts
          east were reconquered, and a new policy carried out of settling
          disaffected subjects in a distant part of the empire. Urartu,
          under a king named Sarduris II, had completely demolished
          Assyrian supremacy in the north. A single sweeping victory over
          him changed all this, and his allies paid their tribute to the
          conqueror. Arpad fell in 740 B.C., and with it the northwest was
          pacified. A new coalition of states of Syria, Asia Minor, and
          Palestine was formed; but at the appearance in the field of the
          Assyrian forces, it fell apart, Menahem of Israel paid tribute,
          the states north of Israel were put under a governor, their
          inhabitants deported, and colonists brought in from other parts.
          A rebellion near Nineveh was suppressed by the governors, who
          had been made responsible for good order. They deported the
          rebellious subjects to Syria and settled Syrians in their
          places. Armenia was crippled in a campaign which reached the
          capital on Lake Van, but did not capture it. Tiglath-Pileser
          began next to clear the road to Egypt, just then weakened by
          attacks from Ethiopia. Syria was effectually overawed, Phenicia
          paid tribute, and Gaza was captured and held as an outpost. To
          offset this, Israel and Damascus had determined to force Judah
          into an alliance against the Assyrian. Ahaz was thoroughly
          alarmed, and all the efforts of Isaiah were insufficient to
          restrain him from throwing himself into the arms of Assyria.
          Tiglath-Pileser listened to the appeal, ravaged Israel, had
          Hoshea made king (II Kings xv-xvi), assailed Damascus, destroyed
          its dependencies, and finally captured it in 732 B.C. While
          engaged in the west, the king heard of rebellion in Babylonia.
          This was punished; and Merodach-baladan, who proved almost a
          perennial rebel, submitted. The Assyrian appointed governors
          from the north instead of leaving native princes to rule, did
          homage to the gods of the land, in 726 B.C. " took the hands of
          Bel," the annual right and duty of the rightful king of Babylon,
          and assumed the name Pul with the old title " King of Sumer and
          Akkad and of Babylon" (see [661]Babylonia). Tiglath-Pileser's
          death occurred the next year. His achievements in war and in
          government were the greatest the world had yet known. The
          Semitic crescent of territory from the Persian Gulf to the
          border of Egypt was his without dispute; tribute was sent from
          Arabia as far south as Sabæa, from Armenia, from Elam, and from
          the states on the Mediterranean. The policy of exchanging
          populations of chronically rebellious states had made the empire
          more homogeneous by putting seditious nations where
          circumstances did not favor risings.

    10. Shalmaneser IV, 727-722 B.C.

          Of Tiglath-Pileser's successor, Shalmaneser IV (727-722 B.C.),
          but little is known, not even his relationship to his
          predecessor. Under him Hoshea was led into what proved the final
          rebellion of the northern Israelitic kingdom, and the episode
          narrated in II Kings xvii occurred. In this chapter Hoshea is
          represented as sending messengers to " So, king of Egypt." So
          has been erroneously identified with Shabak. Sargon mentions a
          Shabi of the Arabian Muzri; Shabi in Assyrian would represent
          the Hebrew word So pointed to read Seve; and modern scholars are
          inclined to follow Winckler (Mittheilungen der vorderasiatischen
          Gesellschaft, i, 5) and see a double confusion in Miz?raim ("
          Egypt" ) for Muz?ri, and in So for Seve. It is to the point that
          this Shabi furnished no little trouble for Sargon, Shalmaneser's
          successor. From him, then, Hoshea expected help and rebelled,
          when Shalmaneser attacked, defeated, and captured him, and
          invested Samaria. The city held out for three years. Meanwhile
          Shalmaneser died and was succeeded by Sargon (722-705 B.C.).
          Samaria was captured in 721; and the Israelitic kingdom ceased
          to exist.

    11. Sargon 722-705 B.C.

          Sargon's ancestry is very doubtful: he claimed no royal lineage,
          nor did his son for him; but his grandson, Sennacherib,
          connected him with the Igur-kapkapu mentioned above. He
          reproduced the traits of the great Tiglath-Pileser
          III--self-confidence, vigor in plan and action, and great
          military and administrative ability. In Babylonia the determined
          rebel Merodach-baladan seized Babylon with the help of the
          Elamites; Sargon claimed the victory in the battle which ensued,
          but Merodach retained his crown. In the west Hamath raised the
          flag of rebellion, and Shabi of Musri and Hanno of Gaza engaged
          to support Hamath; but Sargon attacked the town before the
          allies could come in, then marched south, and defeated Shabi at
          Raphia. The next rising was in the north, with Urartu as the
          backbone of the movement. But Assyria was still able to conquer;
          and, soon after, the old Hittite center, Carchemish, was
          destroyed. Campaigns in Media, eastern Asia Minor, and Arabia
          kept the armies moving. Finally peace was secured in the north
          by the ending of the kingdom of Urartu, which had for centuries
          defied Assyria and proved its most dangerous foe. A new uprising
          in Palestine, Philistia, Edom, and Moab, involving Hezekiah of
          Judah and evidently fomented by Egypt (Isa. xx), necessitated
          the sending of Sargon's tartan with an army, who occupied the
          Philistine cities, deported the inhabitants, and crushed the
          rebellion. The other states seem to have escaped punishment.
          Only Babylon was needed to round out the empire.
          Merodach-baladan had foreign military forces in support; but he
          had alienated the native priests, the most influential class of
          his subjects. They called in the Assyrians, who put the
          Chaldeans to flight; and Sargon was acclaimed the deliverer of
          the city of Babylon. He performed sacrifice and took office as
          viceroy (not king), and restored the temple-worship in the great
          religious centers. In the northwest, boundaries were pushed
          back, and even Cyprus sent tribute. Sargon built Dur-Sharrukin
          with its magnificent palace, but occupied it only a year.

    12. Sennacherib, 705-681 B.C.

          Sargon was succeeded by his son Sennacherib (705-681 B.C.). The
          change in succession was followed by another attempt of
          Merodach-baladan to possess Babylonia. It is likely that the
          embassy to Hezekiah (II Kings xviii, 13) occurred here. If so,
          its motive is plain: he was fomenting a revolt in the west to
          create a diversion while he settled himself in the south. But
          Sennacherib marched south at once, defeated the rebel, captured
          Babylon, rifled the palace, and then punished severely the
          Aramean supporters of the Kaldu, appropriating immense booty and
          removing, according to the Taylor cylinder, over 200,000 people
          and settling them in the Median mountains after a successful
          campaign there. The rebellion fomented by Merodach (if the
          suggestion above be correct) had gathered headway, with Hezekiah
          leading the movement, the latter having seized Philistia. The
          revolt must have been general; for Sennacherib first visited
          Phenicia, captured Sidon, set up his appointee as king, and
          apportioned him a fair kingdom. The coalition fell apart before
          his army, though several of the Philistine towns held out and
          were reduced. An army from Egypt was defeated, Ekron captured,
          and its chiefs impaled. Then Sennacherib turned on Judah,
          captured forty-six towns, deported 200,150 inhabitants, and gave
          the district to his governors in Philistia to manage. Hezekiah
          submitted and paid tribute, to gather which he was compelled to
          strip palace and temple. Sennacherib, either at this time or
          later, sent a small force to demand the surrender of Jerusalem.
          Beyond question the reason for this was that the conquest of
          Egypt was projected, and the Assyrian did not care to leave so
          strong a fortress as Jerusalem in his rear. The surrender was
          refused; the forces were withdrawn; a new campaign in Babylonia
          against the irrepressible Merodach-baladan was successfully
          carried through; and Asshur-nadir-shum, son of Sennacherib, was
          put on the throne of Babylon. The next eleven years were spent
          mainly in the south against the Elamites and Kaldu under
          Merodach-baladan. After holding the country for some time the
          allies were defeated in 691 B.C. after a terrible conflict.
          Babylon was taken, sacked, burned to the ground, the waters of
          the Euphrates turned upon the site, and the statue of Marduk
          taken to Asshur. A final expedition against Egypt was probably
          undertaken near the end of his life by Sennacherib. Tirhakah of
          Egypt advanced to meet him, perhaps as far as Pelusium. There
          Sennacherib experienced a severe check, variously explained. II
          Kings ix, 35 tells of a pestilence which destroyed in a single
          night 185,000 men; Tirhakah claimed credit for a great victory;
          Herodotus (ii, 141) was told by the Egyptians that field-mice
          gnawed the bow-strings and quivers of the Assyrians and left
          them defenseless before the Egyptians; and the Babylonian
          Chronicles suggest the necessity for return in a rebellion in
          that region. Sennacherib was killed in 681 B.C. by one
          (Babylonian Chronicle) or two (II Kings xix, 36-37) of his sons.
          He had removed the seat of government from Calah to Nineveh, and
          built there the " peerless" palace, and had provided the city
          with a system of water-works.

    13. Esar-haddon, 681-668 B.C.

          Esar-haddon (681-668 B.C.), Sargon's son, who succeeded him,
          reversed the policy toward Babylonia. He assumed the title of
          viceroy of Babylon, and almost at once set about rebuilding the
          city in a style of greater grandeur. By restoring the gods
          carried away by his father he regained the good-will of the
          people. His first care, however, was to avenge the death of
          Sennacherib and to secure his own position in Nineveh, whence
          his brothers, the murderers, who had seized the throne, fled on
          his approach. The extreme south, again in rebellion, was subdued
          and the projected invasion of Egypt was undertaken. But first
          the rebellion of Phenicia had to be quelled, in which three
          years were occupied, when Sidon was destroyed, a new city built
          and settled by colonists. Tyre was assailed; but its sea-gate
          enabled it to hold out. In 783 B.C. Tirhakah was enabled to
          repel the first attack on Egypt; but Esar-haddon renewed the
          attempt three years later, was successful in three battles, and
          occupied Memphis. The land was parceled out for government, and
          no great opposition was offered by the people, to whom the
          disaster seemed beyond repair. Northeastern Arabia was then
          subdued that it might no longer afford assistance to the
          recurrent rebellions of Palestine. New troubles were by that
          time affecting the northern boundaries. The Indo-European
          migration, generally known as the Cimmerian or Scythian, had
          begun. This was split into two bodies, one of which pressed down
          into Persia and Media and settled there, and the other passed
          westward. The former occupied a part of what had been Assyrian
          territory, and later formed a part of the force which captured
          Nineveh. The latter passed through Armenia; but its forces were
          prevented by Esar-haddon from penetrating southward. In 668 B.C.
          the king was called to Egypt by rebellion there. Before leaving,
          he had one son proclaimed his successor in Assyria
          (Asshurbanipal) and another in Babylon (Shamash-shum-ukin). He
          died the same year, and before reaching Egypt, having extended
          Assyrian domination farther than it had yet reached. He was fond
          of building, and constructed the great arsenal at Nebi-Yunus,
          the materials for which were contributed by twenty-two kings and
          princes, ten of them in Cyprus. The name of Manasseh of Judah
          appears in this list of tributaries.

    14. Asshurbanipal, 668-626 B.C.

          The events of the reign of Asshurbanipal (668-626 B.C.; Greek,
          Sardanapalus, Aram. Osnappar, Ezra iv, 10) are hard to make out,
          not because of paucity of material, for it is abundant, nor
          because of roughness or carelessness, for the annals are elegant
          and polished, but because the chronological clue is not given.
          It is clear, however, that his first movement was to the
          borderland between Elam and Babylonia, where his presence
          prevented serious trouble. A new invasion of Egypt was made
          necessary by Tirhakah's return, the Assyrian forces being
          gathered partly on the Mediterranean coast. Tirhakah was
          defeated, and the country occupied this time as far south as
          Thebes. A new rising which took place almost immediately was as
          quickly punished in ruthless fashion, and enormous booty was
          sent home. A third insurrection under the son of the now dead
          Tirhakah was futile. Tyre had finally submitted and sent
          tribute. But the story continues of revolts in different parts
          of the empire which presage its speedy fall. The king was
          occupied in desperate attempts to maintain himself.
          Participation in these led to the conquest of Elam up to the
          very walls of Susa. Even his brother on the throne of Babylon
          revolted; but Asshurbanipal's movements were swift and sure.
          Babylon, Borsippa, Sippara, and Cutha were beset;
          Shamash-shum-ukin in despair burned himself in his own palace;
          and people from the captured towns were settled in Samaria. A
          new challenge from Elam was accepted; and finally Susa was taken
          with immense booty. The usual success attended the king's final
          campaign in Arabia. The results of this long succession of
          successful wars was the heaping up of enormous wealth in the
          cities of Assyria, particularly in Nineveh. The end of a
          victorious campaign was the transportation of precious metals,
          works of art, flocks, and herds, and, in the later reigns, of
          people as slaves to Assyria. The great works of the Assyrian
          kings were doubtless in great part the product of the toil of
          captives. And the captors of Nineveh fell heir to this immense
          wealth. Asshurbanipal's wars were not his only interest. Apart
          from the palace which he built, the walls of which were lined
          with sculptured reliefs, he was fond of the hunt, and his
          contests with lions are frequently portrayed. Most significant
          for modern times was his interest in literature. His library,
          uncovered by George Smith, was amassed by the copying of tablets
          from libraries in the south, and contained works on history,
          ethics, science, religion, and linguistics.

    15. Asshurbanipal's Successors, 626-505 B.C.

          Asshurbanipal was succeeded by his son Asshur-etil-ilani, of
          whom it is known that he built or restored the temple E-zida in
          Calah, and that during his fourth year he claimed the title of
          king of Sumer and Akkad. Whether a Sin-shum-lishir next reigned
          is not known; but mention of him as a king of Assyria has been
          found. A Sin-shar-ishkun is known from three tablets from Sippar
          and Erech. In his seventh year he was still king of a part of
          Babylonia, though not of Babylon, over which Nabopolassar had
          established himself. Upon an invasion of Babylonia by the
          Assyrian, Nabopolassar invoked the aid of the Umman-Manda, and
          Sin-char-ishkun was forced to retreat, Nabopolassar securing the
          provinces as the former evacuated them. It seems that one branch
          of the Scythians were allies of the Assyrians at this time and
          actually defeated the armies of the assailants, thus prolonging
          the life of Nineveh. The rush of the Scythians, which so
          terrified western Asia and elicited the prophecies of Nahum and
          Zephaniah (Driver, Introduction, 5th ed., 1894, pp. 314-320), is
          to be explained by their alliance with Assyria and a desire to
          attack Egypt, the king of which, Psammetichus, had assailed
          Philistia. Their sudden disappearance is as remarkable as their
          unheralded coming.

          The Umman-Manda returned soon to Nineveh. The story of the siege
          is unknown; but the city fell 607-606 B.C., and its vast
          treasures became the nucleus of the tremendous wealth of the
          later Persian empire. With it fell the empire which twenty-five
          years earlier had controlled all southwestern Asia.

  VII. The Religion.

    1. Relation to Babylonian Religion.

          From the relationship of Assyrians and Babylonians set forth in
          the preceding it would be expected that both resemblances and
          differences would be found to exist in the two religions. The
          resemblances are as follows: (1) The general character of the
          cults is the same; the liturgies, prayers, psalms are often
          identical, as are some of the deities. (2) The goddesses are of
          minor importance in Assyria, appearing hardly as prominent as in
          the southern land. Theoretically the gods had consorts;
          practically these are but shadows and a name. (3) The great
          exceptions to this in both countries were the Ishtars; to the
          extent exhibited below, the pantheons were the same, at least in
          theory (see [662]Babylonia). The dissimilarities are: (1) Asshur
          assumes the character of a national god as far back as he can be
          traced. (2) His aloofness is a new feature; he in particular
          seems ever without consort and family. (3) The next difference
          needs stating at some length. In their annals the Babylonians
          laid great stress upon their temple-building, even more than
          upon wars and the construction of palaces. From the emphasis
          laid upon religion, and the care taken to house the divinities
          and provide for their maintenance, the country seems
          priest-ridden, with the kings devoted first of all to religion.
          The Assyrians, on the other hand, while indeed they often built
          or restored temples, devoted much less space to the recital of
          their operations and put far less emphasis on the story of this
          activity than on that attending their wars and the construction
          of their palaces. They seemed less absorbed in their religion,
          though not less devout when worshiping. It is a case of
          correctly reading in a lesser abundance of matter a lower
          quality of intensity. Religion seemed less on the Assyrian's
          mind. (4) The pantheon was much smaller. Tiglath-Pileser I, one
          of the most pious of Assyrian monarchs, names Asshur, Bel
          (rarely named elsewhere), Sin, Ramman, Ninib, and Ishtar.
          Shalmaneser II mentions on the obelisk, in addition to the gods
          of Tiglath-Pileser I, Anu, Ea, Marduk, Nergal, Nusku, and Belit.
          It is just the deities mentioned here which were most generally
          disregarded; and their notice by this king is doubtless to be
          traced to his attempt to fuse more closely the north and the
          south. Asshurbanipal omits Anu, Ea, Marduk, and Belit, but
          mentions two Ishtars and adds Nebo. But a caveat should be
          entered here, which is justified by knowledge of facts existing
          in other lands where a similar civilization had been attained;
          as in Oriental countries generally, so in Assyria there were an
          aristocratic or official cult and a popular and democratic cult.
          The pantheon of the kings, particularly of Tiglath-Pileser,
          represented the former; the peasant and farmer worshiped the
          gods and spirits of field, tree, and fountain, and these did not
          get into the inscriptions.

    2. Asshur.

          The chief of the Assyrian pantheon, not found in the pantheon of
          Babylonia, was Asshur. His derivation and origin are obscure,
          though there is some plausibility in the suggestion that he was
          ultimately derived from Anu, the heaven-god of Babylonia. But it
          is possible that Asshur the city was not originally Semitic, and
          that the local god was adopted by the Semitic colonists. As that
          city was for a long period the capital, he became the chief
          deity. The great triad of the south was entirely subordinated
          and lost; Anu, Bel, and Ea find scanty mention in the god-lists
          of the kings. The significance of Asshur is that he stands for
          nationalism. His position from the first seems more elevated,
          his attitude has in it more of aloofness and abstraction than
          even Marduk ever attained in the south. Moreover, he never
          appears to be chained to a locality. Whatever city was the
          capital, there he made his abode. His symbol or representation
          was not an image, but a winged disk surmounted by the figure of
          an archer discharging his shaft. This served also as a military
          standard, and accompanied the armies in their campaigns. While
          individual kings could and did choose what may be called
          individual patrons among the gods, Asshur was always the
          nation's guardian and protagonist, the unquestioned chief. Yet
          it must be noted that in spite of this reverence, even when
          Assyria most completely dominated Babylonia; there was no
          attempt to displace Marduk or Shamash or any other of the
          southern deities by Asshur; his domain was his own country, and
          there was honor among the gods, precluding one from usurping the
          due of another. Sayce was the first to point out that in this
          deity and the conceptions about him there was the possibility of
          all the greatness of a monotheism such as developed in the
          conception of Yahweh. Asshur's position was unique, without wife
          or family, a consideration which doubtless had much to do with
          the elevation of the conception which was formed of his being.
          There seems every reason to assume that he was originally a
          sun-deity, but this feature is not prominent in the original
          records in which he figures. The other gods form, after a
          fashion, his retinue or court, but even this feature is far less
          pronounced than in the case of Marduk.

    3. Ishtar.

          Ishtar was in Syria never one, but at least three; she of
          Nineveh, of Arbela, and of Kitmur (a city of which almost
          nothing is known). The first two were the most prominent; and
          both appear to have been above all goddesses of battle. Ishtar
          of Kitmur ruled in the domain of love. In the south this goddess
          reached her eminence by absorbing or assimilating the beings,
          functions, and rites of local goddesses, such as Nana of Erech,
          Nina and Bau of Shirpurla, Sarpanit of Babylon, and Anunit. In
          neither place was she originally a moon-deity; this function
          appears in late times, and generally in the west after she had
          become associated, often as consort, with Baal as sun-god. In
          some cases religious prostitution was associated with her cult;
          but it was not, as is so often supposed, exclusively or
          primarily her rite. The origin of name and goddess is obscure.
          Nearly, if not quite, all Semitic peoples had a deity of the
          name, though Athtar of South Arabia was male. The hypothesis of
          non-Semitic origin seems out of court, in view of the
          universality of her cult among Semites; and yet no satisfactory
          Semitic etymology has been found. If she was a loan-goddess, she
          was borrowed in the prehistoric age of the Semitic peoples. The
          Ishtar of Nineveh ranked next to Asshur in estimation, was to
          the Assyrians Belit (" the Lady" ), as Asshur was Bel (" the
          Lord" ); yet, as is implied in the foregoing, she was never his
          consort. " Goddess of Battle," " Princess of Heaven and Earth,"
          " Queen of All," are titles given her. In the religious
          literature she is invoked as the " gracious mother of creation,
          the giver of plenty, hearer of the supplications of the sinner,"
          and as the goddess of fertility. It was partly out of this
          latter conception that the debasing worship grew which attended
          her as the Oriental Aphrodite. The functions of the various
          Ishtars were quite the same; and there is more of the primitive
          attachment to locality than in the case of Asshur. (See
          [663]Ashtoreth.)

    4. Ramman.

          The deity who seemed to rank third, at any rate if one may judge
          by the frequency with which his name was used in the formation
          of proper names, was Ramman, the thunderer, god of storms, and
          probably in consequence of this, also of fertility and
          fruitfulness. He was identified with Hadad or Adad, a deity of
          Syria, one of whose principal seats was Aleppo. There has always
          been considerable doubt whether his name, which in the cuneiform
          is represented by the sign IM, should be read Ramman or Hadad.
          The name has been found in the region of Van in the cuneiform
          written phonetically Hadad, so that it is settled that at least
          the form common in Syria was known in Assyria and used there.
          But it is not a necessary conclusion that the sign IM is always
          to be read Hadad and never Ramman.

    5. The Sun-gods Shamash, Ninib, and Nergal.

          Doubtless the cults of Asshur, Ishtar, and Ramman were those
          characteristic of Assyria. But the student of religions will
          always be alert for signs of sun-worship; and, since Asshur, if
          he was indeed originally a sun-deity, had been disassociated
          from that relationship, it would be expected that other deities
          would represent that phase of early worship. There were three
          sun-gods in Assyria who had a more or less prominent position,
          were derived from the south and were known in both lands as
          Shamash, Ninib, and Nergal. The first was par excellence the
          sun-god (cf. the Hebr. shemesh, " sun" ); and the splendor and
          fervor and inspiration of his ritual almost equals that of
          Asshur. It is practically certain that he had temples in every
          city. Ninib became connected among the Assyrians with hunting
          and sports, and then with war. Nergal represented rather the
          maleficent, destructive power of the sun; he was, therefore,
          associated with war as the destroyer, with pestilence, and also
          with the chase.

    6. Sin, the Moon-god, Nusku, the Fire-god.

          A religion which derived its elements in large part from a
          people to whom the moon had been an eminent power would be
          expected to retain clear traces of that cult. Accordingly Sin,
          called also Nannar, the pre-Semitic EN-ZU, god of wisdom, who
          had early seats in Ur and Harran, both connected by the Hebrews'
          tradition with the father of their race, Abraham, had his seats
          of worship also in Assyria. The diffused character of his
          worship will be partly realized when it is remembered that he
          gave his name to the peninsula of Sinai. He was always closely
          associated with the endowment of mankind with wisdom. Nusku was
          a fire-god, then the deity of charms and incantations, a night
          deity, and also associated with the impartation of knowledge.

    7. Rivalry of Babylonia and Assyria.

          Other deities had little place in the worship and regard of the
          people. Mention of them seems rather perfunctory, a sort of
          parade of piety, or a diplomatic measure of conciliation toward
          the south, rather than an acknowledgment of their importance for
          the country or the religion. A factor that swayed mightily the
          selection of the members of the pantheon--a selection which was
          instinctive rather than deliberative and planned--was the
          persistent rivalry of Babylonia and Assyria. It was impossible
          for the god Marduk to become domiciled in Nineveh or Asshur or
          Calah, for he was the god of the rival city. Even if he had been
          more mobile, had the native Babylonian conception of deity been
          more favorable to a change of residence of the god than it was,
          the fact mentioned would have impeded his adoption of a seat in
          the north. But, as has been noted above, even when the arms and
          star of the Assyrians were thoroughly dominant in the south, no
          attempt was made to demand that Asshur take his place at the
          head of the southern pantheon. The image of Marduk was carried
          to Assyria as a sign of his subjection; but that of Asshur was
          not installed in his place, so far as any hint goes in the
          annals accessible. So that the Assyrian recognition of Marduk
          conveys simply the impression of assent to his lordship in his
          own land. It is not beyond suspicion that the tendency to favor
          Nebo was not because he was especially revered, though as the
          god of oracles he became less chained to a locality and more
          eligible to general worship than others; more probably he was
          used by Ramman-nirari and Asshurbanipal to diminish the prestige
          of the almost hostile god Marduk.

    8. Magic.

          The background and undercurrent of Assyrian religion was
          thoroughly animistic. Omens of all sorts were consulted; magic
          of formulas and of material, sympathetic and simple, was
          everywhere; sorcery was a constant peril and device; spirits
          evil and good, maleficent and beneficent, swarmed. The diagnosis
          of disease was recognition of obsession or infliction of
          suffering or prevention of health by spirits or deities who must
          be driven out or exorcised or placated in order to lighten or
          abolish the suffering or to secure health. The formulas of magic
          were numerous and potent, the medicine-man or shaman as well as
          the priest thrived. While for king, nobility, army, and
          priesthood the great gods were supreme, there are hints even in
          the annals of the kings, and more decided proof in the
          collections of magical texts, of apprehensions of the lower
          powers, of hopes that rested not on the gods. Of incantation
          tablets a whole series give a ritual of "the evil demons." Parts
          of the body had their appropriate ritual for their preservation
          from disease and to banish the spirits which chose them as the
          spheres of their operations. The formulas arose and became fixed
          because the occasion which produced them appeared to be
          recurrent. And, as elsewhere in early religion, the exact
          letter, word, and intonation were essential to success in using
          them.

          The idea of sin as transgression against the will of the gods
          was highly developed; and some of the penitential psalms, with
          the polytheistic expressions eliminated, would fitly express the
          most pious sentiments of devout Christians in worship of today.
          The notion of communion between god and man is involved in the
          elaborate system of omens and oracles which obtained. For ideas
          of eschatology, the underworld, and future life, see
          [664]Babylonia.

          513-522). The following axe the more important:

          1. Asterius Urbanus: Montanist, editor of a collection of
          oracles used by the anti-Montanist mentioned in Eusebius, Hist.
          Eccl., V, xvi, 17.

          NPNF, 2d series, i, 232, note 27.

          2. Asterius of Cappadocia: A teacher of rhetoric, converted from
          paganism to Christianity. He relapsed in the persecution under
          Maximianus (c. 305), and, notwithstanding the support of the
          semi-Arian party, could not afterward attain to ecclesiastical
          dignities. Theologically he was a disciple of Lucian of Antioch
          (see [667]Lucian the Martyr) and represented Arianism in a mild
          form. According to Jerome (De vir ill., xciv) he wrote
          commentaries on the Epistle to the Romans, the Gospels, and the
          Psalms.

          3. Bishop of Petra in Arabia. He was originally a follower of
          Eusebius, but renounced the party at Sardica in 343, and was
          banished to Libya. In 362 he took part in the synod held at
          Alexandria.

          4. Bishop of Amasia in Pontus from 378; d. before 431. He was a
          famous pulpit orator of the ancient Greek Church; of his
          homilies, which have historical importance, twenty-one are
          wholly extant, and extracts from six others are given by Photius
          (codex 271). They are in MPG, xl.

          m. s.e. of Bordeaux), Lot et-Garonne, France, Sept. 21, 1822; d.
          at Lausanne May 20, 1892. He studied at Geneva, Halle, and
          Berlin, went to the United States, and was pastor of a French
          church in New York from 1848 to 1853; from 1856 till his death
          he was professor of philosophy and theology in the Free Faculty
          at Lausanne. From 1868 he was joint editor of the Revue de
          Théologie et de Philosophie, published at Geneva and Lausanne.
          Besides polemical pamphlets, he wrote Louis Fourteenth and the
          Writers of His Age, lectures in French delivered in New York,
          translated by E. N. Kirk (Boston, 1855); an account, in French,
          of the religious revival in the United States in 1857-58

   Astruc, Jean
          ASTRUC, as´´trüc´, JEAN: Roman Catholic; b. at Sauve (20 m.
          w.n.w. of Nîmes, department of Gard), Languedoc, Mar. 19, 1684;
          d. in Paris May 5, 1766. He was carefully educated by his
          father, who had been a Protestant pastor, but had been converted
          to Roman Catholicism; he studied also at Montpellier, where he
          received the degrees of M.A. and M.D. (1703), lectured at
          Montpellier, became professor on the medical faculty at Toulouse
          (1710); and at Montpellier (1717). In 1729 he became physician
          to King Augustus III of Poland, returned to France in 1730 as
          physician to Louis XV, was professor at the royal college in
          Paris from 1731, and member of the medical faculty there from
          1743. He was eminent in his profession and published several
          medical treatises of value. The study of skin diseases led him
          to consider the Pentateuchal laws of the clean and the unclean;
          and this occasioned the work which entitles him to mention in a
          theological encyclopedia, a work which is regarded by many
          modern scholars as pointing out the true path of Pentateuchal
          investigation. It appeared anonymously (12mo, Brussels, 1753),
          with the title, Conjectures sur les mémoires originaux dont il
          paroit que Moyse s'est servi pour composer le livre de la Génèe.
          Avec des remarques qui appuient ou qui éclaircissent ces
          conjectures, and consists of a preface (pp. 1-2), preliminary
          remarks (pp 3-24), the Book of Genesis and chapters i and ii of
          Exodus in French translation from the Geneva folio edition of
          1610 arranged according to the supposed mémoires (pp. 25-280),
          the "conjectures" proper (pp. 281-495), closing with an index of
          twenty-eight pages

          That the Pentateuch is based upon older documents was no new
          idea. Astruc's originality consisted rather in his assumption
          that these sources had not been recast, but had been pieced
          together, and in his attempt to reproduce the sources, follow
          ing as a clue the varying use of Elohim and Yahweh for the
          divine name. He thought that he discovered traces of twelve
          documents, and made naive guesses at their authorship; as Amram
          the father and Levi the great-grandfather of Moses for Ex. i-ii,
          and what immediately precedes, respectively; Joseph for his own
          story; Levi for the Dinah narrative (Gen. xxxiv); etc. He
          rightly perceives that his hypothesis explains the two
          expressions for the divine name, as well as repetitions and
          chronological difficulties. He also thinks that it vindicates
          Moses from the reproach of careless workmanship, since it is
          probable that originally he arranged the material in columns
          like the work of Origen or a harmony of the Gospels, and that
          negligent or ignorant copyists put it in consecutive form. The
          Mosaic authorship, Astruc considered established beyond
          possibility of doubt by passages such as John i, 45, v, 46. The
          fear that free thinkers would misuse his work deterred him from
          publishing it till his seventieth year; and he issued it then
          only on the assurance of a man "learned and very zealous for
          religion" that "far from being injurious to the cause of
          religion, it could only be helpful to it, because it would
          remove or clear up several difficulties which arise in reading
          the book and with the weight of which commentators have always
          been burdened" (Preface, p. 1). The title page bears the motto
          Avia Pieridum peragro loca nullius ante trita solo (" Free
          through the muses' pathless haunts I roam, where mortal feet
          have never strayed," Lucretius, iv, 1). A German translation of
          the Conjectures, abridged, appeared at Frankfort in 1782, with
          the title Mutmassungen in Betreff der Originalberichte deren
          sich Moses wahrscheinlicherweise bei Verfertigung des ersten
          seiner Bücher bedient hat, nebst Anmerkungen wodurch diese
          Mutmassungen theils unterstützt theils erläutert werden. As a
          guaranty of his soundness in the faith, Astruc published
          immediately after the Conjectures a Dissertation sur
          l'immartalité et sur l'immatérialité de l'âme with a
          Dissertation sur la liberté (Paris, 1755). His Mémoires pour
          servir à l'histoire de la Faculté de médecine de Montpellier
          were edited after his death with an Éloge historique by A. C.
          Lorry.

   Asylum, Right of
          ASYLUM, RIGHT OF: Among practically all nations is found an
          early belief that places dedicated to the service of divine
          beings acquire a sanctity which makes them inviolable places of
          refuge for people pursued by their enemies. Specific
          prescriptions for the carrying out of this principle are found
          in the Mosaic law (Ex. xxi, 13; Deut. xix, 7-10). Certain
          temples among the Greeks had the same quality; and in Rome,
          where originally only special temples had been places of refuge
          for slaves, under the empire statues of the emperor were
          considered as affording protection, which the law definitely
          recognized in the case of slaves. In early Christian times the
          bishops possessed the privilege of interceding for accused
          persons or condemned criminals, who accordingly fled to the
          churches; but these were not considered inviolable asylums
          either by the ecclesiastical or by the imperial law. On the
          contrary, the latter definitely provided against abuses which
          had grown up in connection with this practise.

          The right of asylum first received legal recognition for the
          West in 399; this was made more definite in 419, extended by
          Valentinian III (425-455), and regulated by Leo I in 466. But
          Justinian restricted it in 535; and the final shape assumed by
          the Roman law was that certain defined classes of persons who
          might have taken sanctuary in the churches could not be removed
          against their will, while the bishops had the right, but not the
          duty, of allowing them to remain there. In the Germanic kingdoms
          forcible violation of an asylum was indeed forbidden; but the
          fugitive had to be surrendered, though he was exempted from the
          penalty of death or mutilation. In the Frankish kingdom the
          Decretio Chlotharii (511-558) took a position in harmony with
          that of the Synod of Orléans (511); the surrender of the
          fugitive was only required on an oath being given to renounce
          the penalties just mentioned; but no secular punishment was
          provided for the violation of sanctuary, and the Carolingian
          legislation did away with this oath, while it denied the right
          of asylum altogether to those condemned to death. Under the
          influence of the Decretum Gratiani and other collections of
          decretals, the right of asylum was considerably extended; and
          this extension has been partly confirmed, partly revised by
          various papal decisions since the sixteenth century.

          In general the right may be said to attach to churches and other
          buildings directly connected with them, to a certain amount of
          adjacent ground, to the whole enclosures of monasteries, to
          hospitals and similar pious institutions, and to episcopal
          palaces. The fugitive, whether judicially condemned or not, and
          even if he has escaped from prison, may not be repulsed or
          removed, even with his consent, by state officers. He may only
          be surrendered when what he has done comes under the head of a
          casus exceptus, such as murder, treason, robbery of churches,
          etc. The violation of sanctuary is sacrilege, and incurs
          excommunication ipso facto. The right of asylum, however,
          provoked a secular reaction after the sixteenth century, which
          in the eighteenth went as far as total abolition in some
          countries. This is now everywhere the case, though the Church
          holds to the right in principle.

   Atargatis
          ATARGATIS, at-ar-gê´tis: A word which does not occur in the
          canonical Scriptures; but in II Macc. xii, 26 mention is made of
          "a temple of Atargatis" (Atargateion) as a place of refuge
          sought by the Arabians' and Ammonites who were defeated by Judas
          Maccabæus. This temple was situated in Carnion (cf. I Macc. v,
          43-44), which is probably the same as the Ashteroth-Karnaim of
          Gen. xiv, 5. The supposition is natural that the place was an
          old seat of Astarte-worship, and some have even identified
          Atargatis directly with Astarte.

          Support has been found for this view in the fact that a
          principal seat of the cult of Atargatis was Ascalon, and that
          Herodotus (i, 105) places there a temple of "the heavenly
          Aphrodite." This is not conclusive, for there may have been
          shrines of both goddesses in the same city, or--which is far
          more probable--the Aphrodite of the days of Herodotus may have
          been succeeded by Atargatis. She had there a famous shrine for
          several centuries before and after the Christian era. Mabug or
          Hierapolis, on the Euphrates, was an equally famous seat of her
          worship.

          In connection with both temples fishes were kept sacred to the
          goddess, and at Ascalon she was represented as a sort of
          mermaid--a woman with the tail of a fish (Lucian, De dea Syria,
          xiv; cf. xlv). Various reasons are given for these customs.
          According to one form of the legends in Greek and Roman writers,
          Derceto (the name Atargatis modified), having thrown herself
          into the water, was saved by a fish (Hyginus, Astronomia, ii,
          30); according to another version she was turned into a fish
          (Diodorus Siculus, ii, 4). The dove, which was sacred to
          Astarte, Aphrodite, and Venus, also figures in the same legends.

          The only question of present importance is the connection
          between the cult of Atargatis and that of Astarte. That the
          connection was close is indicated prima facie by the fact that
          the Atar of Atargatis is the contracted form of Athtar, the
          Aramaic equivalent of Ishtar or Astarte (see [669]Ashtoreth,
          § 2). Presumably Ataris here confounded with the name of another
          deity. A certain Palmyrene god Ati or Atah is supposed to be the
          one in question, but his attributes are not sufficiently known
          to make the combination certain.

          Although a wholly satisfactory explanation of the compound name
          is lacking, a plausible hypothesis as to the leading motive of
          the complex cult may be offered. After the political extinction
          of Semitism, and the consequent depreciation of Ishtar-Astarte
          (along with the decline of the complementary Baal-worship), it
          was found necessary to perpetuate some of the leading features
          of such a wide-spread and deep-rooted cult. The fertility and
          life-giving power of water was one of the most familiar of the
          conceptions of the world of thought and fancy of which Astarte
          was the center. This idea was in large measure suggested by the
          mysterious origin and fecundity of fish, the chief of water
          animals. These consequently figure very largely, along with
          other elements, in the cult of Atargatis, which replaced but did
          not supersede the worship of Astarte. See [670]Ashtoreth.

          The so-called Athanasian Creed (Symbolum Athanasianum, also
          called, from its first word, Symbolum Quicunque) is an
          exposition of the catholic faith which, from the Carolingian
          period, in some places earlier than in others, began to be sung
          at prime every day throughout the Western Church. It was not
          then called a "symbol" or creed; the passage in Theodulf of
          Orléans (De spiritu sancto, MPL, cv, 247) which was supposed so
          to designate it is corrupt, and Hincmar's reference to
          "Athanasius speaking in the creed" (De prædestinatione, MPL,
          cxxv, 374) has been shown to refer, not to this, but to the
          so-called fides Romanorum (see below, [683]II, § 5).

  I. Title not Justified.

    1. Note an Ecumenical Creed.

          None of the manuscripts of the ninth or tenth century, no
          certain quotation of this date, none of the old commentaries,
          call it a creed And even later, Thomas Aquinas expressly says
          that Athanasius wrote his exposition not in the manner of a
          creed but rather in that of a teacher's lesson (Summa, IIb, 1,
          10, 3). And he is right. Nothing was originally considered a
          creed, strictly speaking, but the baptismal profession of faith,
          and only a composition of similar structure could be accounted a
          creed, or more properly, a form of the creed. The Quicunque can
          not come under this head; it is a theological exposition of the
          doctrines of the Trinity and the Incarnation found in the creed.
          It is natural, however, that its use in public worship should
          approximate it in the popular mind to the Apostles' Creed used
          at baptism, and the Nicene used in the mass. As late as 1287, it
          is true, a diocesan synod at Exeter refers to the "articles of
          faith as they are contained in the psalm Quicunque vult and in
          both symbols;" but in the thirteenth century the name of creed
          was not seldom applied to it. Durandus (d. 1296) says "the creed
          is three-fold;" and Alexander of Hales in like manner, writing
          in England about 1230, says, "there are three symbols, one of
          the apostles; one of the Fathers, which is sung in the mass; and
          the third, the Athanasian, which is sung at prime." Accordingly
          the Reformers, when their time came, had learned to receive
          these old confessions as "the three creeds" of catholic
          Christendom. They did not know that the Greek Church had neither
          the Apostles' nor the Athanasian, and the later Lutherans
          included all three as a universal heritage in their Corpus
          doctrinæ. So also Zwingli, the French and Belgic Confessions,
          and the Anglican Thirty-nine Articles expressly accepted the
          three creeds as ecumenical. But the Eastern Churches do not know
          the Athanasian as an authority, in spite of the assertion of the
          Russian theologian Macarius. Of the Reformed Churches, those
          which accept the Westminster Confession, while agreeing with its
          general teaching, do not accept it formally; the American
          Episcopal Church has dropped it from the prayer-book; the
          Churches of Puritan origin and the Methodists do not use it; so
          also the Swiss and French Reformed, to say nothing of the
          antitrinitarian bodies.

    2. Not Athanasian.

          But the Athanasian Creed is not only not ecumenical; it is not
          even Athanasian. Since Gerhard Voss demonstrated this in 1642,
          the Athanasian origin of it has been practically abandoned by
          scholars, even those of the Roman Catholic Church. There are
          decisive grounds against it: it was composed in Latin--the Greek
          forms, which can be shown to be as late as the thirteenth
          century, are mere translations; Athanasius himself, as well as
          his biographers, know nothing of it--the Greeks mention it first
          about 1200; and it expresses things of later origin, such as the
          final settlement of not only the Trinitarian but the
          Apollinarian and Christological controversies, the dogmatic
          formulas of Augustine, and the doctrine of the double procession
          of the Holy Spirit. The evidence of the manuscripts, too, is
          insufficient. Several of them give it without any author's name,
          and of the seven oldest commentaries only two mention Athanasius
          in the title and one in the introduction. Besides all this, it
          is not difficult to account for its attribution to Athanasius.

  II. History of Discussion.

    1. Theories of Origin.

          But, however generally these facts are recognized, there is
          little positive agreement as to any other origin. The period of
          study of the subject which reaches from Voss to 1870 produced a
          bewildering variety of hypotheses. Voss himself conjectured that
          it grew up on Frankish soil under Pepin or Charlemagne, as a
          consequence of the controversies over the filioque; his
          contemporary, Archbishop Ussher, attributed it to an unknown
          author before the middle of the fifth century; and Quesnel to
          Vigilius of Thapsus (c. 500), in which he was followed by Cave,
          Du Pin, and many others. Antelmius was for Vincent of Lerins (c.
          430); Muratori for Venantius Fortunatus (d. c. 600); Lequien
          doubtfully suggested Pope Anastasius I (d. 401); Waterland,
          whose book is the most learned and authoritative of the older
          discussions, favored Hilary of Arles (d. 449); and Speroni
          referred it to Hilary of Poitiers (d. 367).

          A new period in the study of the subject opened with 1870, the
          impulse coming from England, where the creed is publicly recited
          in the Anglican liturgy on certain days, not without opposition.
          The commission for the revision of the Prayer-book in 1689 had
          recommended the insertion of a note explaining away the "
          damnatory clauses," and the question of its retention came up
          again before the Ritual Commission appointed in 1867, with no
          practical result except to stir up fresh interest in the creed
          and advance its study. Ffoulkes tried in 1871 to assign it to
          Paulinus of Aquileia (d. 802); Swainson published a learned, if
          not uniformly satisfactory, book in 1875, coming to the
          conclusion that it was a composite product, which assumed its
          present form between 860 and 870. Lumby's book, published in
          1873, was in substantial agreement with Swainson, dating the
          crystallizing process between 813 and 870. The theory of two
          sources was also accepted, with notable modifications, by
          Harnack in his Dogmengeschichte. He saw in the Trinitarian
          section an exposition of the Nicene Creed, growing up by degrees
          in Gaul from the fifth century and assuming its present form in
          the sixth; to this was added perhaps in the eighth or ninth the
          second half, about whose origin nothing can be certainly said
          except that it is older than the ninth century. Ommanney and
          Burn added new material but no new results. An independent
          French investigation by Morin urged the claims of Pope
          Anastasius II (496-498).

    2. Facts as to Manuscripts.

          Of these hypotheses, those which point to Anastasius I and II do
          not deserve serious consideration, even if they receive a
          specious attractiveness from the fact that some of the
          manuscripts (though the later ones) give the name, and a
          thirteenth century compilation treats " of the third symbol,
          that of Pope Ansatasius" ; but Morin himself admits that without
          this no one would ever have thought of the theory, which has
          really no other support than the stupidity of medieval copyists.
          In order to form an opinion of the other theories, it is
          necessary to glance at the facts as to the manuscripts. Down to
          1870 eight were named as ancient, viz.: (1) a psalter in the
          Cottonian Library, which Ussher put in the time of Gregory the
          Great; (2) the Psalterium Aethelstani in the same collection,
          dated by Ussher 703; (3) the Codex Cobertinus 784, dated by
          Montfaucon c. 750; (4) the Sangermanensis, about the same age;
          (5), the Codex regius 4908, c. 800; (6) the Codex Colbertinus
          1339, called Psalterium Caroli Calvi; (7) the Codex Ambrosianus,
          which Muratori in 1697 thought to be over a thousand years old;
          (8) a psalter in Vienna, presented by a Frankish king Charles to
          a pope Adrian, thought by Waterland to belong to the first year
          of Adrian I (772). Recent investigations have altered the status
          of several of these. That supposed to be the oldest, the one
          named first above, lost after Uesher's time and rediscovered in
          1871 in the so-called Utrecht Psalter, is now believed by
          experts to be of the ninth century, and thus not much older than
          (6), which was certainly written between 842 and 869. The second
          is now known to be a compilation of three pieces, that
          containing the creed being later than the ninth century. The
          fourth can no longer be used as a basis for argument, since it
          is lost. The fifth may not be older than (6); and (8) is
          considered to belong to the time of Charles the Bald and Adrian
          II (867-872). Of all these manuscripts, then, only that numbered
          (7) above can be shown to be older than 800--as not only
          Muratori, Waterland, and Montfaucon believed it to be, but also
          such modern scholars as Ceriani, Reifferscheid, and Krusch have
          maintained. Yet this is not the only one to place the origin
          further back, if only a little further, than 800. Two more must
          now be added: (9) Paris. 13, 159, a psalter from
          Saint-Germain-des-Prés, not the same as (4), assigned on strong
          grounds to c. 795; and (10) Paris. 1451, a collection of canons
          dated with apparent probability 796. The manuscripts, then,
          place the date of the Quicunque at least as early as the end of
          the eighth century.

    3. Ancient Commentaries.

          The same evidence is given by the oldest commentaries. Waterland
          and the older students of the question knew of only one
          commentary older than that attributed to Bruno of Würzburg (d.
          1045)--the so-called Expositio Fortunati. The latter, first
          published by Muratori from the Codex Ambrosianus 79 (eleventh or
          twelfth century), was ascribed by most of the earlier
          investigators to Venantius Fortunatus (d. c. 600), and regarded
          as the oldest evidence of the existence of the Quicunque. At
          present there are sixteen extant manuscripts of this Expositio,
          besides three codices which give the bulk of it in the form of
          glosses. Its ascription to Fortunatus, resting only on the
          comparatively late authority of the Codex Ambrosianus, and
          easily to be explained there by the fact that the codex begins
          with his exposition of the Apostles' Creed, has now been
          abandoned. The only other author's name is offered by a lost
          manuscript from St. Gall, printed by Melchior Goldast in 1610,
          which calls it Euphronii presbyteri expositio. Morin identified
          this Euphronius with the bishop of Tours of that name (555-572),
          who was well known to Venantius Fortunatus. Burn is inclined to
          see its author in Euphronius of Autun, who built the church of
          St. Symphorian there about 450. But this positive criticism is
          very hazardous in view of the number of anonymous manuscripts,
          to say nothing of the frequency of the name Euphronius in Gaul.
          A more important question is that of its date. An attempt has
          been made to decide this from the fact that the author explains
          the words in sæculo in section 31 of the creed (Schaff, Creeds,
          ii, New York, 1887, 68) by "that is, in the sixth millennium
          [sextum miliarium] in which we now are." This has been supposed
          to indicate 799 as the terminus ante quem; but no stress can be
          laid on this; people spoke of the sextum miliarium, with
          Augustine, after 799 as well as before it. Just as little can be
          made of its supposed dependence on Alcuin for a terminus post
          quem, as Ommanney has shown. The only sure limit of date might
          be supposed to be given by the fact that the oldest manuscript
          (Bodleian. Junius 25) belongs to the ninth century--probably the
          beginning--were it not that a whole group of other ancient
          commentaries allow us to put the terminus ante quem further
          back. Ommanney has rendered a signal service to the
          investigation by the discovery of these, and Burn has followed
          independently. These are, in the order of the dates given by
          Burn: (2) the Expositio Parisiensis, certainly written between
          Gregory the Great and 900; (3) the Expositio Trecensis, assigned
          by Ommanney to the seventh, by Burn to the end of the eighth
          century; (4) the Expositio Oratorii, found in the same
          manuscript, dated by Ommanney about 700, by Burn a century
          later; (5) the Stabulensis, ninth century according to Burn; (6)
          the Buheriana, based on (4), and written, according to Ommanney,
          in the first half of the eighth century, to Burn, in the ninth;
          and (7) the Aurelianensis, first published in 1892 by Cuissard,
          who attributes it to Theodulf of Orléans, while Burn is for an
          author of the middle or end of the ninth century. Now, of all
          these commentaries, only the Expositio Fortunati and the
          Trecensis (which in its first part is very dependent on the
          former), do not evidence a knowledge of the entire Quicunque. To
          be sure, Burn's dates--to say nothing of Ommanney's--are by no
          means certain. But none the less these commentaries are of great
          importance as helps to a decision of the difficult problem under
          discussion. The last-named, one of the latest (because dependent
          on three or four of the others), is preserved in a manuscript
          which Delisle assigns to the ninth century; and the Trecensis,
          used in the compilation of this, presupposes in its turn the
          Expositio Fortunati. This being so, it is not too bold a
          conclusion that the latter, everything about which shows it to
          be the oldest of them all, belongs to the period before 799. If
          this is granted, one may go a little further, and point out that
          since its author says nothing about the approaching end of the
          sextum miliarium, he did not live very near that date.

    4. The Theory of Two Sources.

          Both the Expositio Fortunati and the Expositio Trecensis leave
          certain verses of the Quicunque without mention. Are we to
          conclude that the whole of it was not known to their authors? We
          have seen how far the testimony of the manuscripts supports the
          theses of Ffoulkes, Swainson, and Lumby; our Quicunque was
          definitely in existence before the end of the eighth century.
          But that does not in itself militate against the acceptance of
          the theory of two sources; Harnack considers it possible that
          both halves of our present creed were found in conjunction in
          the eighth century, or even earlier. We must therefore look
          further into that theory. Its main support is the manuscript
          referred to above as (3), the Codex Colbertinus 784 (now known
          as Paris. 3836), which all authorities agree to place in the
          eighth century, Swainson dating it as early as 730. In this
          manuscript the Christological portion of the Athanasian Creed
          (though with noteworthy verbal variants) is found under the
          rubricated caption Hæc invini treveris in uno libro scriptum sic
          incipiente Domini nostri Jesu Christi fideliter credat et
          reliqua. Now, assuming that the scribe copied exactly what he
          found in the Treves manuscript, Swainson, Lumby, and Harnack see
          in this text, which goes well back into the eighth century
          (possibly to 730), distinct documentary evidence for the
          separate existence of the Christological half of the Quicunque.
          But it does not seem to have been observed that the manuscript
          will not sustain this contention. The copyist put down in red
          ink, as his introduction, words which actually form a part of
          the verse which makes, in the complete creed, the transition
          from the Trinitarian to the Christological section. The "Treves
          fragment" is thus really a fragment--part of a whole whose first
          half stood in the same relation to our Quicunque as the extant
          second half. There is nothing surprising in this conclusion.
          That a preacher (and Swainson himself has noticed that this
          fragment is clearly a fragment of a sermon) should have
          undertaken to set forth "the faith," and then have spoken only
          of the Incarnation and not of the Trinity, would have been much
          more surprising. But the conclusion, if not surprising, is none
          the less weighty; for it takes both halves of the creed
          distinctly further back than any of the manuscripts described
          above. We do not know how old the Treves manuscript was when the
          writer of Paris. 3836 copied it in 750 or 730; but there is room
          for a logical train of reasoning which leads to valuable
          results. It is obviously improbable that a copyist with a
          complete manuscript before him should copy only the last part,
          beginning in the middle of a sentence; therefore the Treves
          manuscript (or its original) must have been defective. This
          train of thought gains in force when we notice that the
          "fragment" represents exactly a third of our Quicunque. On the
          assumption that the two first pages of the original went down to
          incarnationem quoque, the third beginning with Domini nostri
          Jesu Christi, the loss of the first part would fully explain the
          condition of Paris. 3836. It follows further that the Codex
          Trevirensis, already defective about 750, was more probably than
          not relatively old then, and the manuscript evidence actually
          confirms the supposition that the Treves fragment must
          originally have been preceded by something answering to the
          first section of the present Quicunque. The theory of two
          sources breaks down, therefore, at its strongest point--for the
          other arguments, from both external and internal evidence, are
          very weak.

    5. Parallels to the Athanasian Creed.

          But the interest of the Codex Paris. 3836 is not exhausted by
          its decisive evidence against the two-source theory, or by the
          remarkable text which it offers. It brings up the question
          whether the sermo contained in the Codex Trevirensis was taken
          from the Quicunque, or whether the latter in some way grew out
          of this and other like sermons. The Apostles' Creed in its
          simplicity was the standard of faith for the Western Church at
          least, long after the Trinitarian and Christological
          controversies had carried dogmatic development far beyond its
          simple words. Popular misconceptions of the meaning of those
          words had called for more precise definitions in numerous
          sermons on the creed still extant. To supply these is
          Augustine's aim in his Sermones de traditione symboli (212, 213,
          214), which contain expressions reminding of the Quicunque. The
          same is true of the pseudo-Augustinian 244, attributed by the
          Benedictine editors and some modern scholars to Cæsarius of
          Arles; and whether or not he wrote it, it is a product of the
          Lerins school, in which similar formulas were current. Thus
          Vincent himself recalls our phrases in his Commonitorium (434),
          and other parallels are found in Faustus of Riez, abbot of
          Lerins 433-462, and in Eucherius of Lyons, who was a monk there
          from 416 to 434. But parallels of thought are to be expected
          wherever these traditional theologians discussed the Trinity or
          the Incarnation; and we need only mention here those authors who
          offer us not merely a parallel of thought but a close
          resemblance in phrasing outside of the consecrated formulas of
          definition. Besides Augustine, to whom, as has long been
          recognized, not a few phrases go back, and Vincent of Lerins,
          those who deserve especial mention are Vigilius of Thapsus (or
          the author who passes under his name), Isidore of Seville, and
          Paulinus of Aquileia. In the writings more or less doubtfully
          ascribed to Vigilius, especially the three books against
          Varimadus and the twelve on the Trinity, we find at least three
          sections (13, 15, 17) almost word for word, and a confession of
          faith--the so-called fides Romanorum--which touches the
          Quicunque rather in general structure than in details. Isidore,
          writing on the rule of faith, uses these similar expressions
          directly as an exposition of the Apostles' Creed. The oration of
          Paulinus at the Council of Friuli has led to his identification
          by Ffoulkes as the original author; in it expressions parallel
          to no less than twelve verses of the Quicunque occur. The fact
          that Paulinus was addressing a council reminds us that many
          synodal confessions of faith had a life and an influence far
          beyond their original purpose, being adopted and copied as happy
          formulations of the faith. Thus the Council of Arles (813)
          adopted the Confession of Toledo (633), and many more examples
          might be given. The two most important of these confessions for
          our subject are those described in the newer investigations as
          fides Romanorum and symbolum Damasi. The latter (included under
          this obviously misleading title among the works of Jerome) is
          specially interesting not only because it reminds in several
          places of the Quicunque, and because it is closely related to
          the Toledan confession of 633, but also because a resemblance
          may easily be traced here and there to the Expositio Fortunati.
          Still more important is the other, which, under the title Fides
          catholica ecclesiæ Romanæ, can be traced in manuscript to the
          sixth century. It was cited as Athanasian by Hincmar and by
          Ratramnus in passages which used to be thought to refer to the
          Quicunque; its whole structure is worth notice--it begins with a
          Trinitarian section, reminding us of our subject, and this is
          followed by a Christological one, which, exactly as in the
          Quicunque and in the Toledan confession of 633, goes down to the
          last judgment.

  III. Present Status.

    1. Attempted Conclusion.

          The question whether such expositions of the faith, or any of
          them, presuppose the existence of the Quicunque is the real
          question at the present stage of the discussion. If they do, its
          author must have lived very early; if they do not, its
          development forms only a part of the varied development of these
          expository formula's down through the ages. The decision for the
          first alternative would be easy if any of the theologians named
          above, before Paulinus, could be shown to have been acquainted
          with our Quicunque. But this acquaintance is, for various
          reasons, not probable in the cases of Paulinus, of Cæsarius of
          Arles, of Vincent of Lerins, of Vigilius of Thapsus, or of
          Isidore. Many reasons, for which there is not space here, go to
          make us think further that the same thing applies to the writer
          of the Treves fragment; and, after all, the weight of evidence
          seems in favor of the second alternative mentioned. A
          long-continued and gradual process, in which the sermo
          Trevirensis is but one stage, seems the inevitable conclusion.
          Much remains to be done before the various steps of the process
          can be determined. But one of the most important data for this
          further research is the famous canon of the Council of Autun: "
          If any priest, deacon, subdeacon, or cleric does not receive the
          creed which has been handed down from the Apostles as inspired
          by the Holy Spirit and the creed of bishop St. Athanasius
          without criticism, he is to be condemned by his bishop."
          Waterland and the older investigators had reason to doubt its
          authenticity, which, however, modern research has confirmed. The
          council was demonstrably held under the presidency of Leodegar,
          bishop of Autun 659-683, but its date is not positively known;
          the best we can do is to assign it roughly to 670, as the middle
          of Leodegar's episcopate.

          If, then, the Quicunque was ascribed to Athanasius about 670, a
          still earlier date for the conclusion of its formation may well
          be looked for. The question how much earlier this may be
          involves the question of its birthplace--for productions were
          possible in seventh century Italy and Spain which were
          impossible in the contemporary Merovingian north. Italy is
          excluded by the fact that the copyist of the Codex Paris. 3836
          was not familiar with the Quicunque; nothing speaks for Africa;
          and against Spain may be urged the fact that it seems to have
          been unknown there at a period later than that at which the
          canon of Autun shows it had begun to play an important part in
          the Frankish regions. Besides this negative evidence for a
          Gallic origin, there is the positive one of the frequent echoes
          of it in the fifth century theologians of southern Gaul. But if
          it grew up in France at all, it was not the Merovingian
          theologians who could give it its final shape; the place of this
          development is to be sought in the south of France, between c.
          450 and 600--so that the sermo Trevirensis may very well belong
          to the fifth century. The new importance and significance which
          the document assumed in the Carolingian period does not require
          belief in a late authorship; it is sufficiently explained by the
          fact that the Carolingian culture knew how to make full use of
          this heritage of the past, which had remained isolated and
          inoperative in Gaul during the confusion of the Merovingian
          period. The Quicunque is no product of the early Middle Ages; it
          is a precipitate resulting from the early western development of
          expositions of the creed. But its history shows how in this
          process the theologians' exposition of the faith has been
          confounded with the faith itself to such an extent as to
          preclude its acceptance as a final authority by evangelical
          Christians.

    2. Controversy in Anglican Church.

          The Athanasian Creed is ordered to be recited at morning prayer
          in the Church of England, in place of the Apostles', on a number
          of greater festivals. In the antidogmatic period when the
          American revision of the Prayer-book was made, it was wholly
          omitted; and the same sort of tendency to avoid positive
          expressions of strong belief, which might give offense to those
          who held different views, has caused attempts to be made at
          different times since 1867, if not to remove it from the English
          Prayer-book, at least to render its recitation optional, to omit
          the so-called " damnatory clauses," or by a retranslation to
          avoid the very possible misconstruction which might be placed
          upon them. Of this movement Dean Stanley was one of the
          principal leaders, and Canon Liddon, supported by a large number
          who dreaded any tampering with the standards of faith, was one
          of the principal opponents. The opposition has been so
          determined and vigorous that all propositions for a change have
          thus far been defeated.

   Athanasios Parios
          ATH´´A-NA´SIOS PA-RI´OS: Dogmatician of the Greek Church; b. on
          the island of Paros 1725; d. at Chios June 24, 1813. He studied
          in the Athos academy under Eugenius Bulgaris, and from 1792 till
          1812 was director of the school at Chios, which is the period of
          his most important activity. He belongs to the most prominent
          and fertile theological writers of the Greek Church of his time,
          and was also an able philosopher. A pupil of Bulgaris, in his
          opposition to the West he surpassed his master; he attacked with
          great energy not only the Roman Church and her scholasticism,
          and the Protestants, but also the western rationalism--the worst
          representative of which, in his eyes was Voltaire--particularly
          in its opposition to positive Christianity and monasticism. This
          explains his opposition to the desire of his people for liberty.
          Yet his historical judgment was so far influenced by Bulgaris,
          that in theology he recognized the more recent teachers of his
          Church, even Koressios, as " fathers," and seemingly made
          concessions to Biblical criticism. But Western science he used
          only when he attacked his opponents. His polemical disposition
          sometimes placed him in opposition to his own Church. By his
          connection with the Athos community he became involved in the
          Kolyba-controversy (see [684]Athos), and wrote his " Exposition
          of the Faith" in 1774. In 1776 he was excommunicated, but the
          ban was removed in 1781. His principal work is an " Epitome or
          Summary of the Holy Dogmas of the Faith" (Leipsic, 1806), in
          which he shows his dependence on Bulgaris, but at the same time
          so much independence of thought that this epitome may be
          regarded as one of the most important dogmatic efforts of the
          Greek Church of the eighteenth century. The sources of doctrine
          are, according to him, the Holy Scripture, written tradition,
          and the teaching of the Church as fixed by the synods. The work
          of Christ he treats under the headings of king, priest,
          lawgiver, and judge. In the doctrine of the Lord's Supper he
          accepts transubstantiation. He opposes rationalism in his "
          Christian Apology" (Constantinople, 1797), attacking especially
          the false freedom and the false equality of the French, and
          renouncing all sympathy with the Greek struggles for freedom.
          Against Voltaire especially he directed the " Antidote for
          Evil," which was published after his death (Leipsic, 1818). Of
          his hagiographical works the most noteworthy were lives of
          Gregorios Palamas (Vienna, 1785), and of Marcus Eugenicus
          (1785), which have little independent value. In the " New
          Limonarium" (Venice, 1819) he gives many marvelous stories and
          biographies of modern saints. Very interesting is a treatise at
          the beginning of the book, in which he tries to show that those
          who were condemned as Christians because of a renunciation of
          Islam are just as much martyrs as those of the ancient time.
          Athanasios was also active as a preacher. A discourse on
          Gregorios Palamas, printed after the Logoi of Makarios
          Chrysokephalos (Vienna, 1797?) is a brilliant combination of
          popular eloquence and fanatical rhetoric.

          Athanasius, bishop of Alexandria, was born apparently at
          Alexandria 293; d. there May 2, 373. His fame is due solely to
          his unswerving and self-sacrificing opposition to the Arian
          heresy, and some account of his life, with a statement of his
          views, is given in the article [685]Arianism. A few facts will
          be added here, and an account of his literary activity
          attempted.

  I. Life.

    I. Sources.

          The principal sources for the biography of Athanasius are the
          numerous documents bearing on the great Arian controversy which
          have been preserved, and his own works, which are rich in
          biographical material,--especially his " Apologies" (" against
          the Arians," " to Constantine," and " for his Flight" ) and his
          " History of the Arians for Monks."

          The oration on Athanasius by Gregory Nazianzen (xxi, NPNF, 2d
          ser., 269-280; dating from 380?) is a mere panegyric without
          much biographical value. The biographies prefixed to the
          Benedictine edition of his works are later than the fifth
          century historians and quite worthless. Of greater importance
          are two sources not known to the seventeenth century editor of
          his works. These are the fragment published by Maffei (1738) of
          the so-called Historia acephala, written between 384 and 412,
          and the preface to the " Festal Letters" of Athanasius which are
          preserved in a Syriac version (ed. Cureton, Mai). Both of these
          come apparently from a single older source, and are very careful
          in their chronology, so that since they have been known the
          dates given by Socrates and Sozomen have often to be corrected.

    2. Early Life. Chosen Bishop 326.

          Some difficulties still remain; but a careful comparison of
          these authorities enables us with reasonable security to fix the
          date of Athanasius's consecration at 326, and, with the help of
          a recently discovered fragment of a Coptic " Encomium," written
          by a contemporary of Bishop Theophilus of Alexandria (d. 412),
          to put his birth back to 293. Of his life up to 326, however, we
          still know very little. He seems to have been an Alexandrian;
          that his parents were Christians is not proved. The traditional
          story of his playing at " church" as a boy and, in the character
          of a bishop, so correctly baptizing some catechumens that Bishop
          Alexander (313-326) recognized the validity of the baptism, and
          took the lad under his care, is worthy of its first narrator,
          Rufinus; the chronology is sufficient to condemn it. Devoting
          himself, however, to a clerical life, he served (according to
          the Coptic " Encomium" ) six years as reader; by the outbreak of
          the Arian controversy he was already a deacon, and in close
          relations with the aged bishop Alexander, perhaps as his
          amanuensis. This would account for Alexander's taking him to the
          Council of Nicæa, and perhaps for Sozomen's story that he
          designated him as his successor. At any rate, Athanasius was
          chosen to this office on Alexander's death (326), and was
          received with enthusiasm by the great majority of his flock. His
          opponents early asserted that he was chosen bishop by a minority
          and consecrated secretly; but this is disproved by the evidence
          of the Egyptian bishops assembled in council in 339.

          The position was by no means an easy one. The Meletian schism
          (see [686]Meletius of Lycopolis) had rent the Egyptian Church in
          two; and, although the Nicene decisions had opened the way for a
          termination of the schism, the manner in which this came about
          did not preclude the continuance of strife as to the validity of
          the orders of the Meletian clergy. Athanasius had scarcely been
          consecrated when these disturbances broke out anew, complicated
          by the enmities aroused by his decided anti-Arian attitude.

    3. The Arian Controversy. First Exile.

          At the instance of Eusebius of Nicomedia, the leader of the
          semi-Arians (see [687]Eusebius of Nicomedia and Constantinople,
          the emperor demanded the readmission of Arias into the Church;
          but Athanasius stoutly refused his consent, and immediately the
          storm broke (see [688]Arianism, I). He was summoned before the
          emperor, who was at that time in Nicomedia, and accused of
          conspiring to prevent the export of grain from Egypt to
          Constantinople. Only after long and wearisome exertions did he
          succeed in proving his innocence. Immediately after his return,
          new accusations were brought against him; it was said that he
          had killed a Meletian bishop, Arsenius, and used his bones for
          magical acts. An investigation was ordered, and a synod summoned
          to meet at Cæsarea (334). Athanasius refused to appear; and the
          investigation came to a natural end on the discovery that
          Arsenius was alive. Eusebius, however, still had the emperor's
          ear, and Athanasius was summoned to appear at a synod in Tyre.
          He left Alexandria July 11, 335, but found at Tyre that the
          council had made up its mind to condemn him, and repaired to
          Constantinople, where he succeeded in convincing the emperor of
          the unfairness of the synod. Constantine saw in him, none the
          less, an obstacle to peace, the maintenance of which seemed the
          most desirable thing, and banished him to Treves toward the end
          of the year. Constantine died May 23, 337, and Athanasius's
          first exile ended with his return to his diocese, Nov. 23 of the
          same year, his entrance into the city being, according to
          Gregory Nazianzen, " more triumphal than had ever an emperor."

    4. Second and Third Exiles.

          The opposition and intrigues still continued, however; the
          enemies of Athanasius accused him of having sold and employed
          for his own use the corn which the late emperor had destined for
          the poor widows of Egypt and Libya. A synod of African bishops
          declared in his favor, but as Constantius was influenced by
          Eusebius of Nicomedia, and as the prefect of Egypt, Philagrius,
          wanted the see for a countryman of his own, Gregory of
          Cappadocia, he was driven into his second exile March 19, 339,
          and Gregory was installed by military force at Easter.
          Athanasius went to Rome, where he was well received by Pope
          Julius, and later to Gaul to confer with Hosius, whom he
          accompanied to Sardica to take part in the famous council held
          there (343?). After spending some time at Naïssus in Dacia, at
          Aquileia, and in Gaul (where he met Constans, whose influence
          with his brother was exerted in his favor), he finally appeared
          once more before Constantius, and obtained permission to return.
          Gregory died June 25, 345, and was not replaced; and Athanasius
          was able to resume his jurisdiction Oct. 21, 346. After the
          death of Constans (Jan., 350), his position once more became
          unsafe; and the end of a long series of intrigues and
          machinations was that the " Duke" Syrianus surrounded the church
          of St. Theonas with 5,000 soldiers to arrest him on the night of
          Feb. 8, 356. He escaped, and fled the next day, finding refuge
          during this his third exile among the monks and hermits of the
          desert, though for a part of the time he lay concealed within
          the city, and by his writings continued to encourage his
          faithful followers. On Feb. 24, 357, another Cappadocian,
          George, was made bishop, and as many as possible of the
          ecclesiastical offices were filled by Arians. George, however,
          was able to maintain himself for only eighteen months, and then,
          after a three years' absence, was imprisoned three days after
          his return, and put to death in the disturbances which followed
          the death of Constantius. The new emperor, Julian the Apostate
          (361-363), issued an edict permitting the exiled bishops to
          return to their sees, hoping thus to increase the confusion in
          the Church, to the profit of the paganism which he was bent on
          restoring. The third exile of Athanasius thus ended Feb. 21,
          362.

    5. Fourth and Fifth Exiles.

          But a fourth exile followed shortly. The new emperor's
          counselors found Athanasius too dangerous a man for their plans,
          and Julian issued a special edict commanding him, as he had
          returned to Alexandria without personally receiving permission,
          to leave it at once (Oct. 24, 362). He remained in concealment
          in the deserts of the Thebaid until he heard of Julian's death
          (June 26, 363), when he returned to Alexandria (Sept. 5), though
          only to pass through on his way to see the new emperor, Jovian,
          at Antioch. Jovian received him kindly, and his fourth exile was
          definitely terminated by his return on Feb. 20, 364. Jovian's
          death after only eight months brought fresh trouble to the
          orthodox. An edict of Valens (May 5, 365) reversed Julian's
          recall of the exiled bishops; and on Oct. 5 the prefect
          Flavianus broke into the church of St. Dionysius and compelled
          Athanasius to flee once more. He remained at a villa in the
          neighborhood of the city, until Valens found the discontent in
          so important a place as Alexandria dangerous, and made a special
          exception in favor of Athanasius, who was able to return Jan.
          31, 366. The last seven years of his episcopate were
          undisturbed.

    6. Relations with Monasticism.

          The refuge of Athanasius among the monks and hermits of the
          desert during his third and fourth periods of exile leads up to
          a point which needs special mention--his relations with
          monasticism. Athanasius was not only the father of orthodoxy in
          the East, but also the first bishop to take an active part in
          encouraging the monastic life. This assertion is so far from
          being founded on the " Life of Anthony" alone that it would
          still be demonstrable if his authorship of that work were less
          certain than it is. From an early period he was in close
          relations with Egyptian monasticism. When the assembled bishops
          in 339 designate him as " one of the ascetics" (referring to the
          motives which led to his election), it may mean no more than
          that he belonged to the large number in the Christian community
          who practised the ascetic life in varying degrees, without
          retiring from the world. We can not say whether his personal
          intercourse with Anthony (d. 356) occurred altogether after he
          was a bishop or partly before. But he came early in his
          episcopate into contact with Pachomius (d. 345), who came out
          with his brethren to greet their new bishop when he undertook a
          visitation of the Thebaid between the Easters of 328 and 329.
          Lasting relations with this colony were kept up by means of the
          yearly visits of deputations of the monks to Alexandria for the
          purpose of making necessary purchases. Pachomius is reported to
          have said that there were three sights specially pleasing to the
          eyes of God in the Egypt of his time--Athanasius, Anthony, and
          his own community of monks. Athanasius knew Theodore, the
          successor of Pachomius, and visited him in his desert retreat at
          Phboou--probably in 363, for which year we have evidence of a
          journey as far south as Antinoe and Hermopolis. So well known
          were these relations that an imperial officer sent by
          Constantius to apprehend him in 360 searched for him, though in
          vain, at Phboou. When Theodore died (368), Athanasius wrote his
          successor a letter of warm sympathy. These long and intimate
          relations with Egyptian monasticism support the assertion of
          Jerome (Epist., cxxvii) that the Roman lady Marcella first heard
          through Athanasius, in 341, of Anthony, Pachomius, and the
          ascetic communities of the Thebaid. If, however, he rendered
          monasticism a service by calling to it the attention of the
          western world, he did even more for it by successfully combating
          the tendency which it showed at first to form a caste apart
          from, and to some extent in rivalry with, the clergy; he was
          also the first (at least in the Church of the empire) to promote
          monks to the episcopate--a point of great importance to the
          later development of the Eastern Church.

  II. Writings.

    1. His Works in Chronological Order.

          Athanasius ranks high as an author--though it may be doubted
          whether he would have attained so high a place had it not been
          for the epoch-making war which he waged upon Arianism. Of pure
          learning he had not much, or else it was put in the background
          by the more absorbing interests of his life. His most important
          works were written for some special purpose of the moment; and
          they may therefore be best considered in their chronological
          order, the more that any classification of them is practically
          impossible. The editors of his works place first the two
          connected treatises " Against the Heathen" and " On the
          Incarnation." These have until recently been considered as a
          product of Athanasius's youth (c. 318); but some recent critics
          (Schultze, Dräseke) have attempted to deny his authorship and to
          assign them to the middle of the fourth century. The grounds
          given for this opinion are unconvincing, although the date may
          be brought down as late as 325. Next follow the oldest of the "
          Festal Letters" (329-335 and 338-339); of the later ones only
          short fragments have been preserved, either in Greek or
          Syriac--among them part of the 39th, which is important for its
          bearing on the New Testament canon. Up to 348 the only things
          that can be surely dated are the " Encyclical Letter," written
          soon after Easter, 339, and the discussion of Matt. xi, 27
          (probably incomplete), belonging to a time before the death of
          Eusebius of Nicomedia. But with the collection of documents
          known as the " Apology against the Arians" (between 347 and 351)
          begins a long series of works more important for the history of
          the period, and at the same time more certainly to be dated.
          These are the " Defense of the Nicene Council" (probably 351);
          the " Defense of Dionysius" soon after; the " Letter to
          Dracontius" (Easter, 354 or 355); the " Letter to the Bishops of
          Egypt and Libya" (between February of 356 and the same month of
          357); the " Apology to Constantius" (probably summer of 357);
          the " Apology for his Flight," a little later; the " History of
          the Arians for Monks" (end of 357 or beginning of 358); the "
          Letter to Serapion on the Death of Arius" (358); the four "
          Letters to Serapion," decisive for the doctrine of the
          consubstantiality of the Holy Ghost (during the third exile); "
          On the Synods of Ariminum and Seleucia" (end of 359); the " Book
          to the Antiochians" (362); the " Letter to Jovian" (364); the "
          Letter to the Africans" (probably 369); and about the same time,
          after the Roman synod of 369 or 370, the " Letters to
          Epictetus," " to Adelphus," and " to Maximus the Philosopher,"
          so weighty for the controversies of the fifth century. We have
          not mentioned in this enumeration a few important works whose
          date can not be certainly determined, as well as a large number
          of smaller letters, sermons, and fragments. To the former class
          belong the " Life of Anthony," whose genuineness has been
          disputed of late years on insufficient grounds; the " Four
          Orations against the Arians," which have by many been considered
          the dogmatic masterpiece of Athanasius (usually dated in the
          third exile, but for various reasons more probably to be
          assigned to a much earlier date, say, 338 or 339); the
          fragmentary " Longer Sermon on the Faith," and the " Statement
          of Faith," both of which seem fairly assignable to the earliest
          period of Athanasius's authorship. Owing to his fame, it is not
          to be wondered at that a large number of works were ascribed to
          him which have since been classed as doubtful or certainly not
          his. For the famous exposition of the doctrines of the Trinity
          and Incarnation which passes under his name, see [689]Athanasian
          Creed.

    2. His Teaching.

          As to the teaching of Athanasius, especially in regard to his
          Christology, consult the article [690]Arianism; some further
          discussion of his views on the human nature of Christ, which
          deserve a more thorough examination than they have ever
          received, will be found under [691]Nestorius. It is the opinion
          of Harnack that the doctrine of Athanasius is identical with
          that of Alexander and underwent no development. But it would be
          difficult to prove that the teaching of the two is really
          identical, at least on the basis of the writings of Athanasius
          from the " Defense of the Nicene Council" on; and perhaps as
          hard to show that his views did not develop as time went on. It
          is more probable (though the question needs more thorough
          investigation) that he began by simply accepting Alexander's
          teaching, and then struck out a path of his own. His
          terminology, in questions of Christology, demonstrably changes.
          The earlier works, like those of Alexander, do not use the word
          which became the crucial test of orthodoxy, homoousios; even in
          the main thesis of the " Statement of Faith" homoios tOi patri
          is found, though homoousios occurs in the explanations, but with
          an express caution against a Sabellian meaning. The same
          impression is strengthened by the " Orations against the
          Arians," written after he had spent some time in banishment at
          Treves; it is probably an already visible effect of his contact
          with western thought that we get a slightly different
          terminology--but the influence of the older phrases, which he
          gave up later, is still clearly marked; he employs the word
          homoousios, which his opponents rejected as unscriptural, only
          once in passing, and uses homoios several times to denote the
          generic identity of substance between the Father and the Son. In
          short, in these " Orations" Athanasius's terminology is in a
          transitional stage, not free from uncertainty. Later, he got
          over his concealed dread of the term homoousios, though without
          giving up the assimilation of ousia and hypostasis, as to which
          he was evidently uncertain in the" Orations." In fact, his later
          homoousios is scarcely distinguishable from monoousios, and the
          earlier homoios [tes ousias] no longer sufficed him. If we ask
          the origin of this change between 339 and 343-352, it will be
          obvious that we can not neglect to think of his sojourn in the
          West from 339 to 346, and his intercourse with Marcellus.
          Further evidences of development may be found in his teaching as
          to the manhood of Christ. If, however, his change of attitude
          toward the Homoousians, his condemnation of Basil of Ancyra,
          etc., show that he was capable of development, it need not be
          taken as a reproach. He knew better than many of his
          contemporaries how to separate the fact, as to which he never
          wavered, from the formulas employed to describe it; his
          convictions were fixed early, but to the end of his life he
          never obstinately asserted the completeness of the phrases he
          had chosen to express them. Through evil report and good report,
          through the many changes of a long and eventful career, he
          maintained indisputably his title to the respect which we give
          to love of truth and honesty of mind.

   Atheism
          ATHEISM:

    Different Uses of the Word.

          A term employed with some variety of connotation. Sometimes it
          is taken purely negatively and applied to every point of view
          which does not distinctly assert the existence of God, or order
          the life in view of his claims upon it. In this application it
          is broad enough to include not only such systems as
          [692]Agnosticism and [693]Secularism (qq.v.), but even that
          simple forgetfulness of God which is commonly known as "
          practical atheism." Sometimes, on the other hand, it is given a
          distinctly positive sense, and made to designate the dogmatic
          denial of the existence of God. Even when it is so understood,
          however, it has a wider and a narrower application, dependent on
          the meaning attached to the term " God," the denial of which
          constitutes its differentiation. In its narrowest sense, it is
          confined to those theories which deny the existence of all that
          can be called God, by whatever extension or even abuse of that
          term. In this sense it stands over against Pantheism or
          Fetishism, as truly as over against Theism; and takes its place
          alongside of this whole series of terms as designating a
          distinct theory of the universe. In its widest sense, on the
          contrary, it receives its definition in contrast with, not a
          vague notion of the divine, but the specific conception of
          Theism, and designates all those systems, differing largely in
          other respects, which have in common that they are antagonistic
          to a developed Theism. In this application, Atheism is
          synonymous with Antitheism, and includes not only [694]Pantheism
          (q.v.), but even Polytheism, and, with some writers, Deism
          itself,--all of which fail in some essential elements of a clear
          Theism. Most commonly the term is employed by careful writers
          either in its narrowest sense, or else in the somewhat broadened
          sense of the denial of a personal God. Between these two
          definitions choice is not easy. All depends on our definition of
          God, and what we are prepared to admit to involve recognition of
          him. From the point of view of developed Theism all that can be
          thought God is denied when a living personal God, the creator,
          preserver, and governor of all things is disallowed; it is
          inevitable, therefore, that from the standpoint of Theism,
          Atheism should tend to receive one of its more extended
          connotations. It may be truer to the historical sense of the
          term, however, to take it in its narrowest sense and to treat it
          as designating only one of the Antitheistic theories, and as
          standing as such alongside of the others, from which it is
          differentiated in that it denies the validity of the notion of
          God altogether; while the others allow the possible or actual
          existence of the divine in one or another sense of that term.

    The Possibility of Atheism.

          The question which has been much discussed, whether Atheism is
          possible, depends for its solution very much upon its
          definition. That negative Atheism, especially in the form of "
          practical atheism," is possible, is evident from its persistent
          appearance in the world. Whether men may be totally ignorant of
          God or not, they certainly can very completely ignore him. And
          if the great atheistic systems like Buddhism and Confucianism
          have not been able to preserve the purity of their Atheism, no
          more have the great theistic systems--Mohammedanism, Judaism,
          Christianity itself--been able to eliminate " practical atheism"
          from among their adherents. It is equally idle to deny the
          possibility of positive Atheism in its wider sense, in the face
          of the great part which has been played in the world by the
          various forms of Pantheism, which not only underlies whole
          systems of religion but is continually invading with its leaven
          the most austere and complete systems of Theism. It is only in
          its narrowest sense, in which it is the denial of all that is
          called God or that is worshiped, that the possibility of Atheism
          can be brought into question, and then only when we regard it,
          not in its outward expression, but in the most intimate
          convictions of the heart. No one can doubt that portentous
          systems of reasoned Atheism have flourished in the bosom of the
          most advanced culture. As little can it be denied that, among
          the backward races, a very low order of religious conception may
          sometimes be discovered. It may well be contended, however, that
          even the most thoroughly compacted system of atheistic thought
          only overlies and conceals an instinctive and indestructible "
          sense of the divine," just as the most elaborated system of
          subjective idealism only insecurely covers up an ineradicable
          realism; and that it is this innate " sense of the divine" which
          we see struggling in the conceptions of low savages to express
          itself in the inadequate forms which alone a low stage of
          culture can provide for it. If this is all that is meant,
          Atheism is, no doubt, a condition impossible to man. Man differs
          from the lower creations, not in being less dependent than they,
          but in being conscious of his dependence and responsibility; and
          this consciousness involves in it a sense of somewhat, or
          better, some one, to which he is thus related. The explication
          of this instinctive perception into an adequate conception is a
          different matter; and in this explication is wrapped up the
          whole development of the idea of God. But escape from the
          apprehension of a being on whom we are dependent and to whom we
          are responsible is no more possible than escape from the world
          in which we live. God is part of our environment.

    History of Atheism.

          The history of reasoned Atheism is as old as the history of
          thought. There can be no right thinking unless there be
          thinking, and it is incident to thinking among such creatures as
          men that some may think awry. In all ages, accordingly, the
          declaration has found its verification that those who have not
          liked to retain God in their knowledge he has given over to a
          reprobate mind. India and China both early gave birth to
          gigantic atheistic systems. The materialism of classical
          antiquity found its expression especially in the
          Atomists--Democritus, Epicurus, Lucretius. The unbelief of the
          eighteenth century ran to seed in the French Encyclopedists--De
          la Mettrie, D'Holbach, Diderot, Lalande--and embodied itself in
          that Système de la Nature which Voltaire called the Bible of
          Atheism. In the nineteenth century the older materialism
          strengthened itself by alliance, on the one hand, with advancing
          scientific theory, and, on the other, with the increasing social
          unrest; and Atheism found expression through a series of great
          systems--Positivism, Secularism, Pessimism, Socialism. The
          doctrine of [695]Evolution (q.v.), which was given scientific
          standing by Darwin's Origin of Species (1859), became almost at
          once the prime support and stay of the atheistic propaganda. In
          every department of thought " evolution" is supposed to account
          for everything, while itself needing no accounting for. Men as
          widely unlike in everything else as Feuerbach, Strauss,
          Flourens, Czolbe, Duehring, Vogt, Buechner, Moleschott,
          Mailänder, Haeckel, Nietzsche, have united in a common
          proclamation of dogmatic Atheism; and probably in no period
          since the advent of Christianity has positive Atheism been
          proclaimed with more confidence or accepted more widely.

   Athenagoras
          ATHENAGORAS, ath´´e-nag´o-ras: Reputed author of two Greek
          treatises of the time of the Antonines, one on the resurrection,
          the other an apology for the Christians. He is entirely unknown
          to the tradition of the Church. Eusebius, Jerome, and their
          successors are silent, and, as the survey which Eusebius gives
          of the apologetic literature of the second century is very
          complete, his silence could not fail to attract attention. Very
          early the existence of an apologist of the name was doubted and
          the work was ascribed to Justin (cf. Baronius, Annales, ii, ad
          an. 179, chap. xxxix). This supposition, however, is from
          internal reasons untenable. The first testimony, and the only
          one from the third century, to the existence of the apology and
          the name of its author, is a quotation by Methodius, found (1)
          in the ancient Bulgarian translation (ed. Bonwetsch, i, 293);
          (2) in Epiphanius, Hær., lxiv, 20, 21; (3) in Photius, Bibl.
          cod. 234 (cf. Athenagorus, Supplicatio, xxiv, p. 27 B). Certain
          notices by an unknown scribe (Cod. Barocc. 142, fol. 216)
          quoting from the " Christian History" of Philippus Sidetes
          (early in the fifth century) state that Athenagoras was an
          Athenian by birth, and first director of the catechetical school
          of Alexandria; he lived in the time of Hadrian and Antoninus
          Pius; like Celsus, he was occupied with searching the Scriptures
          for arguments against Christianity, when he was suddenly
          converted. Most of these notices, however, are palpably
          erroneous. Yet, in spite of the entire absence of tradition and
          the close resemblance to the apology of Justin, the date of the
          work must be placed somewhere in the second century. It is
          addressed to the emperors Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Aurelius
          Commodus, and various passages indicate the period between 176
          and 178. After an introduction (i-iii) the author refutes the
          chief calumnies urged against the Christians in that day, viz.,
          that they were atheists (iv-xxx), and that they ate human flesh
          and committed the most horrible crimes in their assemblies
          (xxxi-xxxvi). In the treatise on the resurrection, Athenagoras
          argues in its favor from the goodness, wisdom, and power of God,
          together with the natural constitution of man.

   Athos
          ATH´OS: The easternmost of the three tongues of land projecting
          into the Ægean Sea from the Chalcidian peninsula. It is about 35
          miles long and culminates at the southern extremity in Mt. Athos
          proper, 6,780 feet high. Grand forests, murmuring brooks, clear
          air, and charming combination of rocks and sea, make it one of
          the most beautiful spots of Europe. By the Orthodox Greeks it is
          always called " the Holy Mount."

    The Various Monasteries.

          According to the legend, the Holy Virgin Christianized Mt. Athos
          and Constantine the Great founded the first monasteries there.
          But the Athos monasticism does not appear in church history
          before the middle of the ninth century. At that time the monks
          formed a laura of the old fashion, with its center at Karyas,
          presided over by a prOtos appointed by the emperor in
          Constantinople. With the founding of the Laura of St.
          Athanasius, the first great monastery there, in 963, Athos rises
          in historical importance. The founder of this monastery (which
          still bears his name) and of the whole monastic life on Mt.
          Athos, belonged to a noble family in Trebizond. Through Michael
          Maleinos, the famous hegumenos of Mt. Kyminos in Asia Minor,
          where he himself lived at first as monk, he became acquainted
          with the future emperor, Nicephoras II (Phocas). The two men
          became good friends and the laura was founded at the instance of
          the emperor. Ever after Athos enjoyed imperial favor and
          monasteries were founded in rapid succession. To the tenth
          century belongs the founding of Iveron, Vatopedi, and Philotheu;
          to the eleventh, Xeropotam, Esfigmenu, Dochiariu, Agiu Paulu,
          Karakallu, and Xenophontos; to the twelfth, the two important
          Slav monasteries, Russiko and Chilandari; to the thirteenth,
          Zografu; and to the fourteenth, Pantokratoros, Simopetra,
          Dionysiu, and Gregoriu. The most recent is Stauronikita, founded
          in 1542. There were others which long ago disappeared, such as a
          Latin monastery of the Amalfines.

    The Monastic Life to the Fifteenth Century.

          Until the fifteenth century all the monks lived together,
          according to rules laid down by Athanasius in his three
          writings, the Kanonikon, the Diatheke, and the so-called
          DiatypOsis (of. Meyer, Haupturkunden). Any man of unblemished
          character could be received; but women, children, beardless
          youths, and people of royal descent were forbidden entrance.
          After a three years' probation admission into the holy company
          of the brethren took place and the tonsure was received. At the
          head of the monastery stood the hegoumenos, assisted by a
          council of " the chosen," i.e., the higher monastic officers and
          the priest-monks. Two ephors, generally a noble layman outside
          of Athos and a monk not belonging to the monastery, formed a
          non-resident directorate. Approved monks could live by
          themselves, and received a special dwelling (Gk. kellion),
          whence they were called kelliotes, or after their mode of
          living, ascetics or hesychasts, but were dependent on the
          monastery. The relation of the monasteries to each other and the
          entire constitution of the holy mount was regulated at that
          period by the typica of 975, 1045, and 1394 (printed in Meyer).
          The prOtos stood at the head, by his side the synaxis,
          consisting of the representatives of the monasteries, which as
          before met at Karyas. At first the life during this period was
          austere, but in the eleventh century it relaxed, and at one time
          nomads with wives and children were sheltered at Athos (Meyer,
          163 sqq.). The Latin rule at Constantinople was an especially
          sad time for the monasteries. In the Hesychastic controversy
          (1341-51) western science was rejected especially through the
          influence of the Athos monks and quietistic mysticism was
          received into the teachings of the Greek Church (see
          [697]Hesychasts).

    Changes after 1500.

          With the fifteenth century a new period commences in the
          constitution of the holy mount, which by degrees transformed the
          entire life. The idiorrhythmic life begins, which consisted in
          the abolition of the common life in the monasteries and the
          adoption of a plan whereby every monk, sometimes with a few
          friends, lived by himself. The common roof and the church alone
          are common to all. Since every one lived at his own expense, the
          power of the hegumenos was soon crippled. But the influence of
          idiorrhythm went still further. As the monasteries following it
          soon became worldly, the stricter tendency, which was by no
          means extinct, reacted upon the monks and new places of earnest
          asceticism were established outside of the monasteries, such as
          the sketai, monastic villages, the first of which was founded by
          St. Anna in 1572. Here one could live an ascetic life after the
          old fashion. Such sketes were dependent on their monasteries;
          their rights are set forth in separate collections of canons
          (cf. Meyer, 248). The last regulation of the rights of the
          kelliotes, who still remained, and of the sketists took place in
          1864 (Meyer, 254). The influence of idiorrhythm was ultimately
          of such a character on the general constitution of the holy
          mount, that the office of protos was abolished and the entire
          constitution became democratic. The last typicon is of 1783
          (Meyer, 243). In the nineteenth century half of the monasteries
          returned to the common life, but the old constitution was
          retained. Down to the eighteenth century the religious and moral
          life was of a low type. After 1750 there seems to have been a
          revival. At that time [698]Eugenios Bulgaris (q.v.) was teacher
          in the academy of Vatopedi. At the end of the eighteenth century
          there were certain lively religious controversies on Mt. Athos,
          among others the so-called kolyba controversy--whether the
          memorial days of the dead could be celebrated on Sunday instead
          of Saturday.

          On the whole the life on Athos has remained unchanged, and is
          still a remnant of pure medievalism. The great number of
          manuscripts and documents there offer to the scholar a rich
          field of activity. The student of art finds all that Byzantine
          art produced gathered together. The student of religion can
          study the Eastern piety of all Christian centuries, for each
          period has left behind distinct remains. It is to be hoped that
          the struggle of the nationalists, especially the struggle of
          Panhellenism against Panslavism, will not deprive the Athos
          monachism of its universality.

  I. Significance and History of the Doctrine.

    1. The New Testment Presentation.

          The replacement of the term "[700]satisfaction" (q.v.), to
          designate, according to its nature, the work of Christ in saving
          sinners, by "atonement," the term more usual at present, is
          somewhat unfortunate. "Satisfaction" is at once the more
          comprehensive, the more expressive, the less ambiguous, and the
          more exact term. The word "atonement" occurs but once in the
          English New Testament (Rom. v, 11, A. V., but not R. V.) and on
          this occasion it bears its archaic sense of "reconciliation,"
          and as such translates the Greek term katallage. In the English
          Old Testament, however, it is found quite often as the stated
          rendering of the Hebrew terms kipper, kippurim, in the sense of
          "propitiation," "expiation." It is in this latter sense that it
          has become current, and has been applied to the work of Christ,
          which it accordingly describes as, in its essential nature, an
          expiatory offering, propitiating an offended deity and
          reconciling him with man. In thus characterizing the work of
          Christ, it does no injustice to the New Testament
          representation. The writers of the New Testament employ many
          other modes of describing the work of Christ, which, taken
          together, set it forth as much more than a provision, in his
          death, for canceling the guilt of man. To mention nothing else
          at the moment, they set it forth equally as a provision, in his
          righteousness, for fulfilling the demands of the divine law upon
          the conduct of men. But it is undeniable that they enshrine at
          the center of this work its efficacy as a piacular sacrifice,
          securing the forgiveness of sins; that is to say, relieving its
          beneficiaries of "the penal consequences which otherwise the
          curse of the broken law inevitably entails." The Lord himself
          fastens attention upon this aspect of his work (Matt. xx, 28,
          xxvi, 28); and it is embedded in every important type of New
          Testament teaching,--as well in the Epistle to the Hebrews (ii,
          17), and the Epistles of Peter (I, iii, 18) and John (I, ii, 2),
          as currently in those of Paul (Rom. viii, 3; I Cor. v, 7; Eph.
          v, 2) to whom, obviously, " the sacrifice of Christ had the
          significance of the death of an innocent victim in the room of
          the guilty" and who therefore " freely employs the category of
          substitution, involving the conception of imputation or
          transference" of legal standing (W. P. Paterson, art. Sacrifice
          in DB, iv, 343-345). Looking out from this point of view as from
          a center, the New Testament writers ascribe the saving efficacy
          of Christ's work specifically to his death, or his blood, or his
          cross (Rom. iii, 25-59; I Cor. x, 16; Eph. i, 7; ii, 13; Col. i,
          20; Heb. ix, 12, 14; I Pet. i, 2, 19; I John i, 7, v, 6-8; Rev.
          i, 5), and this with such predilection and emphasis that the
          place given to the death of Christ in the several theories which
          have been framed of the nature of our Lord's work, may not
          unfairly be taken as a test of their scripturalness. All else
          that Christ does for us in the breadth of his redeeming work is,
          in their view, conditioned upon his bearing our sins in his own
          body on the tree; so that " the fundamental characteristic of
          the New Testament conception of redemption is that deliverance
          from guilt stands first; emancipation from the power of sin
          follows upon it; and removal of all the ills of life constitutes
          its final issue" (O. Kirn, art. Erlösung in Hauck-Herzog, RE, v,
          464; see [701]Redemption).

    2. Development of the Doctrine.

          The exact nature of Christ's work in redemption was not made the
          subject of scientific investigation in the early Church. This
          was due partly, no doubt, just to the clearness of the New
          Testament representation of it as a piacular sacrifice; but in
          part also to the engrossment of the minds of the first teachers
          of Christianity with more immediately pressing problems, such as
          the adjustment of the essential elements of the Christian
          doctrines of God and of the person of Christ, and the
          establishment of man's helplessness in sin and absolute
          dependence on the grace of God for salvation. Meanwhile
          Christians were content to speak of the work of Christ in simple
          scriptural or in general language, or to develop, rather by way
          of illustration than of explanation, certain aspects of it,
          chiefly its efficacy as a sacrifice, but also, very prominently,
          its working as a ransom in delivering us from bondage to Satan.
          Thus it was not until the end of the eleventh century that the
          nature of the Atonement received at the hands of Anselm (d.
          1109) its first thorough discussion. Representing it, in terms
          derived from the Roman law, as in its essence a " satisfaction"
          to the divine justice, Anselm set it once for all in its true
          relations to the inherent necessities of the divine nature, and
          to the magnitude of human guilt; and thus determined the
          outlines of the doctrine for all subsequent thought.
          Contemporaries like Bernard and Abelard, no doubt, and perhaps
          not unnaturally, found difficulty in assimilating at once the
          newly framed doctrine; the former ignored it in the interests of
          the old notion of a ransom offered to Satan; the latter rejected
          it in the interests of a theory of moral influence upon man. But
          it gradually made its way. The Victorines, Hugo and Richard,
          united with it other elements, the effect of which was to cure
          its one-sidedness; and the great doctors of the age of developed
          scholasticism manifest its victory by differing from one another
          chiefly in their individual ways of stating and defending it.
          Bonaventura develops it; Aquinas enriches it with his subtle
          distinctions; Thomist and Scotist alike start from it, and
          diverge only in the question whether the " satisfaction" offered
          by Christ was intrinsically equivalent to the requirements of
          the divine justice or availed for this purpose only through the
          gracious acceptance of God. It was not, however, until the
          Reformation doctrine of justification by faith threw its light
          back upon the " satisfaction" which provided its basis, that
          that doctrine came fully to its rights. No one before Luther had
          spoken with the clarity, depth, or breadth which characterize
          his references to Christ as our deliverer, first from the guilt
          of sin, and then, because from the guilt of sin, also from all
          that is evil, since all that is evil springs from sin (cf. T.
          Harnack, Luther's Theologie, ii, Leipsic, 1886,16-19, and Kirn,
          ut sup., 467). These vital religious conceptions were reduced to
          scientific statement by the Protestant scholastics, by whom it
          was that the complete doctrine of " satisfaction" was formulated
          with a thoroughness and comprehensiveness of grasp which has
          made it the permanent possession of the Church. In this, its
          developed form, it represents our Lord as making satisfaction
          for us " by his blood and righteousness" ; on the one hand, to
          the justice of God, outraged by human sin, in bearing the
          penalty due to our guilt in his own sacrificial death; and, on
          the other hand, to the demands of the law of God requiring
          perfect obedience, in fulfilling in his immaculate life on earth
          as the second Adam the probation which Adam failed to keep;
          bringing to bear on men at the same time and by means of the
          same double work every conceivable influence adapted to deter
          them from sin and to win them back to good and to God,--by the
          highest imaginable demonstration of God's righteousness and
          hatred of sin and the supreme manifestation of God's love and
          eagerness to save; by a gracious proclamation of full
          forgiveness of sin in the blood of Christ; by a winning
          revelation of the spiritual order and the spiritual world; and
          by the moving example of his own perfect life in the conditions
          of this world; but, above all, by the purchase of the gift of
          the Holy Spirit for his people as a power not themselves making
          for righteousness dwelling within them, and supernaturally
          regenerating their hearts and conforming their lives to his
          image, and so preparing them for their permanent place in the
          new order of things which, flowing from this redeeming work,
          shall ultimately be established as the eternal form of the
          Kingdom of God.

    3. Various Theories.

          Of course, this great comprehensive doctrine of " the
          satisfaction of Christ" has not been permitted to hold the field
          without controversy. Many " theories of the atonement" have been
          constructed, each throwing into emphasis a fragment of the
          truth, to the neglect or denial of the complementary elements,
          including ordinarily the central matter of the expiation of
          guilt itself (of. T. J. Crawford, The Doctrine of Holy Scripture
          Respecting the Atonement, Edinburgh, 1888, pp. 395--401; A. B.
          Bruce, The Humiliation of Christ, Edinburgh, 1881, lecture 7; A.
          A. Hodge, The Atonement, Philadelphia, 1867, pp. 17 sqq.). Each
          main form of these theories, in some method of statement or
          other, has at one time or another seemed on the point of
          becoming the common doctrine of the Churches. In the patristic
          age men spoke with such predilection of the work of Christ as
          issuing in our deliverance from the power of Satan that the
          false impression is very readily obtained from a cursory survey
          of the teaching of the Fathers that they predominantly conceived
          it as directed to that sole end. The so-called " mystical" view,
          which had representatives among the Greek Fathers and has always
          had advocates in the Church, appeared about the middle of the
          last century almost ready to become dominant in at least
          Continental Protestantism through the immense influence of
          Schleiermacher. The " rectoral or governmental theory," invented
          by Grotius early in the seventeenth century in the effort to
          save something from the assault of the Socinians, has ever since
          provided a half-way house for those who, while touched by the
          chilling breath of rationalism, have yet not been ready to
          surrender every semblance of an " objective atonement," and has
          therefore come very prominently forward in every era of decaying
          faith. The " moral influence" theory, which in the person of
          perhaps the acutest of all the scholastic reasoners, Peter
          Abelard, confronted the doctrine of " satisfaction" at its
          formulation, in its vigorous promulgation by the Socinians and
          again by the lower class of rationalists obtained the widest
          currency; and again in our own day, its enthusiastic advocates,
          by perhaps a not unnatural illusion, are tempted to claim for it
          the final victory (so, e.g., G. B. Stevens, The Christian
          Doctrine of Salvation, New York, 1905; but cf. per contra, of
          the same school, T. V. Tymms, The Christian Idea of Atonement,
          London, 1904, p. 8). But no one of these theories, however
          attractively they may be presented, or however wide an
          acceptance each may from time to time have found in academic
          circles, has ever been able to supplant the doctrine of "
          satisfaction" either in the formal creeds of the Churches, or in
          the hearts of simple believers. Despite the fluidity of much
          recent thinking on the subject, the doctrine of " satisfaction"
          remains to-day the established doctrine of the Churches as to
          the nature of Christ's work of redemption, and is apparently
          immovably entrenched in the hearts of the Christian body (cf. J.
          B. Remensnyder, The Atonement and Modern Thought, Philadelphia,
          1905, p. xvi).

  II. The Five Chief Theories of the Atonement.

          A survey of the various theories of the Atonement which have
          been broached, may be made from many points of view (cf.
          especially the survey in T. G. Crawford, ut sup., pp. 385-401;
          Bruce, ut sup., lecture 7; and for recent German views, F. A. B.
          Nitzsch, Lehrbuch der evangelischen Dogmatik, Freiburg, 1892,
          §§ 43-46; O. Bensow, Die Lehre von der Versöhnung, Gütersloh,
          1904, pp. 7-156; G. A. F. Ecklin, Erlösung and Versöhnung,
          Basel, 1903, part 4). Perhaps as good a method as any other is
          to arrange them according to the conception each entertains of
          the person or persons on whom the work of Christ terminates.
          When so arranged they fall naturally into five classes which may
          be enumerated here in the ascending order.

    1. Terminating upon Satan.

    1. The " Triumphantorial Theory."

          1. Theories which conceive the work of Christ as terminating
          upon Satan, so affecting him as to secure the release of the
          souls held in bondage by him. These theories, which have been
          described as emphasizing the " triumphantorial" aspect of
          Christ's work (Ecklin, ut sup., pp. 113 sqq.) had very
          considerable vogue in the patristic age (e.g., Irenæus,
          Hippolytus, Clement of Alexandria, Origen, Basil, the two
          Gregories, Cyril of Alexandria, down to and including John of
          Damascus and Nicholas of Methone; Hilary, Rufinus, Jerome,
          Augustine, Leo the Great, and even so late as Bernard). They
          passed out of view only gradually as the doctrine of "
          satisfaction" became more widely known. Not only does the
          thought of a Bernard still run in this channel, but even Luther
          utilized the conception. The idea runs through many
          forms,--speaking in some of them of buying off, in some of
          overcoming, in some even of outwitting (so, e.g., Origen) the
          devil. But it would be unfair to suppose that such theories
          represent in any of their forms the whole thought as to the work
          of Christ of those who made use of them, or were considered by
          them a scientific statement of the work of Christ. They rather
          embody only their author's profound sense of the bondage in
          which men are held to sin and death, and vividly set forth the
          rescue they conceive Christ has wrought for us in overcoming him
          who has the power of death.

    2. Terminating Physically on Man.

    2. " Mystical Theories" and their Advocates.

          2. Theories which conceive the work of Christ as terminating
          physically on man, so affecting him as to bring him by an
          interior and hidden working upon him into participation with the
          one life of Christ; the so-cared " mystical theories." The
          fundamental characteristic of these theories is their discovery
          of the saving fact not in anything which Christ taught or did,
          but in what he was. It is upon the Incarnation, rather than upon
          Christ's teaching or his work that they throw stress,
          attributing the saving power of Christ not to what he does for
          us but to what he does in us. Tendencies to this type of theory
          are already traceable in the Platonizing Fathers; and with the
          entrance of the more developed Neoplatonism into the stream of
          Christian thinking, through the writings of the Pseudo-Dionysius
          naturalized in the West by Johannes Scotus Erigena, a constant
          tradition of mystical teaching began which never died out. In
          the Reformation age this type of thought was represented by men
          like Osiander, Schwenckfeld, Franck, Weigel, Boehme. In the
          modern Church a new impulse was given to essentially the same
          mode of conception by Schleiermacher and his followers (e.g., C.
          I. Nitzsch, Rothe, Schöberlein, Lange, Martensen), among whom
          what is known as the " Mercersburg School" (see [702]Mercersburg
          Theology) will be particularly interesting to Americans (e.g.,
          J. W. Nevin, The Mystical Presence, Philadelphia, 1846). A very
          influential writer among English theologians of the same general
          class was F. D. Maurice (1805-72), although he added to his
          fundamental mystical conception of the work of Christ the
          further notions that Christ fully identified himself with us
          and, thus partaking of our sufferings, set us a perfect example
          of sacrifice of self to God (cf. especially Theological Essays,
          London, 1853; The Doctrine of Sacrifice, Cambridge, 1854; new
          ed., 1879). Here, too, must be classed the theory suggested in
          the writings of the late B. F. Westcott (The Victory of the
          Cross, London, 1888), which was based on a hypothesis of the
          efficacy of Christ's blood, borrowed apparently directly from
          William Milligan (cf. The Ascension and Heavenly Highpriesthood
          of our Lord, London, 1892) though it goes back ultimately to the
          Socinians, to the effect that Christ's offering of himself is
          not to be identified with his sufferings and death, but rather
          with the presentation of his life (which is in his blood, set
          free by death for this purpose) in heaven. " Taking this blood
          as efficacious by virtue of the vitality which it contains, Dr.
          Westcott holds that it was set free from Christ's body that it
          might vitalize ours, as it were, by transfusion" (C. H. Waller,
          in the Presbyterian and Reformed Review, ii, 1892, p. 656). Some
          what similarly H. Clay Trumbell (The Blood Covenant, New York,
          1885) looks upon sacrifices as only a form of blood covenanting,
          i.e., of instituting blood-brotherhood between man and God by
          transfusion of blood; and explains the sacrifice of Christ as
          representing communing in blood, i.e., in the principle of life,
          between God and man, both of whom Christ represents. The theory
          which has been called " salvation by sample," or salvation. " by
          gradually extirpated depravity," also has its affinities here.
          Something like it is as old as Felix of Urgel (d. 818; see
          [703]Adoptionism), and it has been taught in its full
          development by Dippel (1673-1734), Swedenborg (1688-1772),
          Menken (1768-1831), and especially by Edward Irving (1792-1834),
          and, of course, by the modern followers of Swedenborg (e.g., B.
          F. Barrett). The essence of this theory is that what was assumed
          by our Lord was human nature as he found it, that is, as fallen;
          and that this human nature, as assumed by him, was by the power
          of his divine nature (or of the Holy Spirit dwelling in him
          beyond measure) not only kept from sinning, but purified from
          sin and presented perfect before God as the first-fruits of a
          saved humanity; men being saved as they be come partakers (by
          faith) of this purified humanity, as they become leavened by
          this new leaven. Certain of the elements which the great German
          theologian J. C. K. von Hofmann built into his complicated and
          not altogether stable theory--a theory which was the occasion of
          much discussion about the middle of the nineteenth
          century--reproduce some of the characteristic language of the
          theory of " salvation by sample."

    3. " Moral Influence Theories." The Essential Thought.

          3. Theories which conceive the work of Christ as terminating on
          man, in the way of bringing to bear on him inducements to
          action; so affecting man as to lead him to a better knowledge of
          God, or to a more lively sense of his real relation to God, or
          to a revolutionary change of heart and life with reference to
          God; the so-called " moral influence theories." The essence of
          all these theories is that they transfer the atoning fact from
          the work of Christ to the response of the human soul to the
          influences or appeals proceeding from the work of Christ. The
          work of Christ takes immediate effect not on God but on man
          leading him to a state of mind and heart which will be
          acceptable to God, through the medium of which alone can the
          work of Christ be said to affect God. At its highest level, this
          will mean that the work of Christ is directed to leading man to
          repentance and faith, which repentance and faith secure God's
          favor, an effect which can be attributed to Christ's work only
          mediately, that is, through the medium of the repentance and
          faith it produces in man. Accordingly, it has become quite
          common to say, in this school, that " it is faith and repentance
          which change the face of God;" and advocates of this class of
          theories sometimes say with entire frankness, " There is no
          atonement other than repentance" (Auguste Sabatier, La Doctrine
          de l'expiation et son évolution historique, Paris, 1903, Eng.
          transl., London, 1904, p. 127).

    4. Various Forms of These Theories.

          Theories of this general type differ from one another, according
          as, among the instrumentalities by means of which Christ affects
          the minds and hearts and actions of men, the stress is laid upon
          his teaching, or his example, or the impression made by his life
          of faith, or the manifestation of the infinite love of God
          afforded by his total mission. The most powerful presentation of
          the first of these conceptions ever made was probably that of
          the Socinians (followed later by the rationalists, both earlier
          and later,--Töllner, Bahrdt, Steinbart, Eberhard, Löffler,
          Henke, Wegscheider). They looked upon the work of Christ as
          summed up in the proclamation of the willingness of God to
          forgive sin, on the sole condition of its abandonment; and
          explained his sufferings and death as merely those of a martyr
          in the cause of righteousness or in some other non-essential
          way. The theories which lay the stress of Christ's work on the
          example he has set us of a high and faithful life, or of a life
          of self-sacrificing love, have found popular representatives not
          only in the subtle theory with which F. D. Maurice pieced out
          his mystical view, and in the somewhat amorphous ideas with
          which the great preacher F. W. Robertson clothed his conception
          of Christ's life as simply a long (and hopeless) battle against
          the evil of the world to which it at last succumbed; but more
          lately in writers like Auguste Sabatier, who does not stop short
          of transmuting Christianity into bald altruism, and making it
          into what he calls the religion of " universal redemption by
          love," that is to say, anybody's love, not specifically Christ's
          love, for every one who loves takes his position by Christ's
          side as, if not equally, yet as truly, a savior as he (The
          Doctrine of the Atonement in its Historical Evolution, Eng.
          transl., ut sup., pp. 131-134; so also Otto Pfleiderer, Das
          Christusbild des urchristlichen Glaubens in
          religionsgeschichtlicher Beleuchtung, Berlin, 1903, Eng.
          transl., London, 1905, pp. 164-165; cf. Horace Bushnell,
          Vicarious Sacrifice, New York, 1865, p. 107: " Vicarious
          sacrifice was in no way peculiar" ). In this same general
          category belongs also the theory which Albrecht Ritschl has
          given such wide influence. According to it, the work of Christ
          consists in the establishment of the Kingdom of God in the
          world, that is, in the revelation of God's love to men and his
          gracious purposes for men. Thus Jesus becomes the first object
          of this love and as such its mediator to others; his sufferings
          and death being, on the one side, a test of his steadfastness,
          and, on the other, the crowning proof of his obedience
          (Rechtfertigung und Versöhnung, iii, §§  41-61, 3d ed., Bonn,
          1888, Eng. transl., Edinburgh, 1900). Similarly also, though
          with many modifications, which are in some instances not
          insignificant, such writers as W. Herrmann (Der Verkehr des
          Christen mit Gott, Stuttgart, 1886, p. 93, Eng. transl., London,
          1895), J. Kaftan (Dogmatik, Tübingen, 1901, pp. 446 sqq.), F. A.
          B. Nitzsch (Evangelische Dogmatik, Freiburg, 1892, pp. 504-513),
          T. Häring (in his Ueber das Bleibende im Glauben an Christus,
          Stuttgart, 1880, where he sought to complete Ritschl's view by
          the addition of the idea that Christ offered to God a perfect
          sorrow for the world's sin, which supplements our imperfect
          repentance; in his later writings, Zu Ritschl's
          Versöhnungslehre, Zurich, 1888, Zur Versöhnungslehre, Göttingen,
          1893, he assimilates to the Grotian theory), E. Kühl (Die
          Heilsbedeutung des Todes Christi, Berlin, 1890), G. A. F. Ecklin
          (Die Heilswerth des Todes Jesu, Gütersloh, 1888; Christus Unser
          Bürge, Basel, 1900; and especially Erlösung und Versöhnung,
          1903, which is an elaborate history of the doctrine from the
          point of view of what Ecklin calls in antagonism to the "
          substitutional-expiatory" conception, the "
          solidaric-reparatory" conception of the Atonement,--the
          conception, that is, that Christ comes to save men not primarily
          from the guilt, but from the power of sin, and that " the sole
          satisfaction God demands for his outraged honor is the
          restoration of obedience," p. 647). The most popular form of the
          " moral influence" theories has always been that in which the
          stress is laid on the manifestation made in the total mission
          and work of Christ of the ineffable and searching love of God
          for sinners, which, being perceived, breaks down our opposition
          to God, melts our hearts, and brings us as prodigals home to the
          Father's arms. It is in this form that the theory was advocated
          (but with the suggestion that there is another side to it), for
          example, by S. T. Coleridge (Aids to Reflection), and that it
          was commended to English-speaking readers of the last generation
          with the highest ability by John Young of Edinburgh (The Life
          and Light of Men, London, 1866), and with the greatest literary
          attractiveness by Horace Bushnell (Vicarious Sacrifice, New
          York, 1865; see below, [704]§ 7; see also article [705]Bushnell,
          Horace); and has been more recently set forth in elaborate and
          vigorously polemic form by W. N. Clarke (An Outline of Christian
          Theology, New York, 1898, pp. 341-367), T. Vincent Tymms (The
          Christian Idea of Atonement, London, 1904), G. B. Stevens (The
          Christian Doctrine of Salvation, New York, 1905), and C. M. Mead
          (Irenic Theology, New York, 1905).

          In a volume of essays published first in the Andover Review (iv,
          1885, pp. 57 sqq.) and afterward gathered into a volume under
          the title of Progressive Orthodoxy (Boston, 1886), the
          professors in Andover Seminary made an attempt (the writer here
          being, as was understood, George Harris) to enrich the " moral
          influence" theory of the Atonement after a fashion quite common
          in Germany (cf., e.g., Häring, ut sup.) with elements derived
          from other well-known forms of teaching. In this construction,
          Christ's work is made to consist primarily in bringing to bear
          on man a revelation of God's hatred of sin, and love for souls,
          by which he makes man capable of repentance and leads him to
          repent revolutionarily; by this repentance, then, together with
          Christ's own sympathetic expression of repentance God is
          rendered propitious. Here Christ's work is supposed to have at
          least some (though a secondary) effect upon God; and a work of
          propitiation of God by Christ may be spoken of, although it is
          accomplished by a " sympathetic repentance." It has accordingly
          become usual with those who have adopted this mode of
          representation to say that there was in this atoning work, not
          indeed " a substitution of a sinless Christ for a sinful race,"
          but a " substitution of humanity plus Christ for humanity minus
          Christ." By such curiously compacted theories the transition is
          made to the next class.

    4. Terminating on Man Primarily and on God Secondarily.

          Theories which conceive the work of Christ as terminating on
          both man and God, but on man primarily and on God only
          secondarily.

    5. " Rectorial or Governmental Theories."

          The outstanding instance of this class of theories is supplied
          by the so-called " rectoral or governmental theories." These
          suppose that the work of Christ so affects man by the spectacle
          of the sufferings borne by him as to deter men from sin; and by
          thus deterring men from sin enables God to forgive sin with
          safety to his moral government of the world. In these theories
          the sufferings and death of Christ become, for the first time in
          this conspectus of theories, of cardinal importance,
          constituting indeed the very essence of the work of Christ. But
          the atoning fact here too, no less than in the " moral
          influence" theories, is man's own reformation, though this
          reformation is supposed in the rectoral view to be wrought not
          primarily by breaking down man's opposition to God by a moving
          manifestation of the love of God in Christ, but by inducing in
          man a horror of sin, through the spectacle of God's hatred of
          sin afforded by the sufferings of Christ,--through which, no
          doubt, the contemplation of man is led on to God's love to
          sinners as exhibited in his willingness to inflict all these
          sufferings on his own son, that he might be enabled, with
          justice to his moral government, to forgive sins.

    6. Advocates of These Theories.

          This theory was worked out by the great Dutch jurist Hugo
          Grotius (Defensio fidei Christianæ de satisfactione Christi,
          etc., Leyden, 1617; modern ed., Oxford, 1856; Eng. transl., with
          notes and introduction by F. H. Foster, Andover, 1889) as an
          attempt to save what was salvable of the established doctrine of
          satisfaction from disintegration under the attacks of the
          Socinian advocates of the " moral influence" theories (see
          [706]Grotius, Hugo). It was at once adopted by those Arminians
          who had been most affected by the Socinian reasoning; and in the
          next age became the especial property of the better class of the
          so-called supranaturalists (Michaelis, Storr, Morus, Knapp,
          Steudel, Reinhard, Muntinge, Vinke, Egeling). It has remained on
          the continent of Europe to this day, the refuge of most of
          those, who, influenced by the modern spirit, yet wish to
          preserve some form of " objective," that is, of Godward
          atonement. A great variety of representations have grown up
          under this influence, combining elements of the satisfaction and
          rectoral views. To name but a single typical instance, the
          commentator F. Godet, both in his commentaries (especially that
          on Romans) and in a more recent essay (published in The
          Atonement in Modern Thought by various writers, London, 1900,
          pp. 331 sqq. ), teaches (certainly in a very high form) the
          rectoral theory distinctly (and is corrected therefor by his
          colleague at Neuchâtel, Prof . Gretillat, who wishes an "
          ontological" rather than a merely " demonstrative" necessity for
          atonement to be recognized). Its history has run on similar
          lines in English-speaking countries. In Great Britain and
          America alike it has become practically the orthodoxy of the
          independents. It has, for example, been taught as such in the
          former country by Joseph Gilbert (The Christian Atonement,
          London, 1836), and in especially well worked-out forms by R. W.
          Dale (The Atonement, London, 1876) and Alfred Cave (The
          Scriptural Doctrine of Sacrifice, Edinburgh, 1877; new ed. with
          title, The Scriptural Doctrine of Atonement and Sacrifice, 1890;
          and in The Atonement in Modern Thought, ut sup., pp. 250 sqq.).
          When the Calvinism of the New England Puritans began to break
          down, one of the symptoms of its decay was the gradual
          substitution of the rectoral for the satisfaction view of the
          Atonement. The process may be traced in the writings of Joseph
          Bellamy (1719-90), Samuel Hopkins (1721-1803), John Smalley
          (1736-1820), Stephen West (1735-1819), Jonathan Edwards, Jr.
          (1745-1801), Nathanael Emmons (1745-1800); and Edwards A. Park
          was able, accordingly, in the middle of the nineteenth century
          to set the rectoral theory forth as the " traditional orthodox
          doctrine" of the American Congregationalists (The Atonement:
          Discourses and Treatises by Edwards, Smalley, May, Emmons,
          Griffin, Burge, and Weeks with an Introductory Essay by Edwards
          A. Park, Boston, 1859; cf. Daniel T. Fiske, in the Bibliotheca
          Sacra, Apr., 1861, and further N. S. S. Beman, Sermons on the
          Atonement, New York, 1825, 2d ed., 1846; N. W. Taylor, Lectures
          on the Moral Government of God, New York, 1859; Albert Barnes,
          The Atonement in its Relation to Law and Moral Government,
          Philadelphia, 1859; Frank H. Foster, Christian Life and
          Theology, New York, 1900; Lewis F. Stearns, Present Day
          Theology, New York, 1893). The early Wesleyans also gravitated
          toward the rectoral theory, though not without some hesitation,
          a hesitation which has sustained itself among British Wesleyans
          until to-day (cf., e.g., W. B. Pope, Compendium of Christian
          Theology, London, 1875; Marshall Randles, Substitution, a
          Treatise on the Atonement, London, 1877; T. O. Summers,
          Systematic Theology, 2 vols., Nashville, Tenn., 1888; J. J.
          Tigert, in the Methodist Quarterly Review, Apr., 1884), although
          many among them have taught the rectoral theory with great
          distinctness and decision (e.g., Joseph Agar Beet, in the
          Expositor, Nov., 1892, pp. 343-355; Through Christ to God,
          London, 1893). On the other hand, the rectoral theory has been
          the regnant one among American Methodists and has received some
          of its best statements from their hands (cf. especially John
          Miley, The Atonement of Christ, New York, 1879; Systematic
          Theology, ii, New York, 1894, pp. 65-240); although there are
          voices raised of late in denial of its claim to be considered
          distinctively the doctrine of the Methodist Church (J. J.
          Tigert, ut sup.; H. C. Sheldon, in AJT, viii, 1904, pp. 41-42).

    7. Horace Bushnell.

          The final form which Horace Bushnell gave his version of the "
          moral influence" theory, in his Forgiveness and Law (New York,
          1874; made the second volume to his revised Vicarious Sacrifice,
          1877) stands in no relation to the rectoral theories; but it
          requires to be mentioned here by their side, because it supposes
          like them that the work of Christ has a secondary effect on God,
          although its primary effect is on man. In this presentation,
          Bushnell represents Christ's work as consisting in a profound
          identification of himself with man, the effect of which is, on
          the one side, to manifest God's love to man and so to conquer
          man to him, and, on the other, as he expresses it, " to make
          cost" on God's part for man, and so, by breaking down God's
          resentment to man, to prepare God's heart to receive man back
          when he comes. The underlying idea is that whenever we do
          anything for those who have injured us, and in proportion as it
          costs us something to do it, our natural resentment of the
          injury we have suffered is undermined, and we are prepared to
          forgive the injury when forgiveness is sought. By this theory
          the transition is naturally made to the next class.

    Terminating On God Primarily and on Man Secondarily.

          5. Theories which conceive the work of Christ as terminating
          primarily on God and secondarily on man.

    8. " Theories of Reconciliation."

          The lowest form in which this ultimate position can be said to
          be fairly taken, is doubtless that set forth in his remarkably
          attractive way by John McLeod Campbell (The Nature of the
          Atonement and its relation to Remission of Sins and Eternal
          Life, London, 1856; 4th ed., 1875), and lately argued out afresh
          with even more than Campbell's winningness and far more than his
          cogency, depth, and richness, by the late R. C. Moberly
          (Atonement and Personality, London, 1901). This theory supposes
          that our Lord, by sympathetically entering into our condition
          (an idea independently suggested by Schleiermacher, and
          emphasized by many continental thinkers, as, for example, to
          name only a pair with little else in common, by Gess and
          Häring), so keenly felt our sins as his own, that he could
          confess and adequately repent of them before God; and this is
          all the expiation justice asks. Here " sympathetic
          identification" replaces the conception of substitution; "
          sodality," of race-unity; and " repentance," of expiation.
          Nevertheless, the theory rises immeasurably above the mass of
          those already enumerated, in looking upon Christ as really a
          Savior, who performs a really saving work, terminating
          immediately on God. Despite its insufficiencies, therefore,
          which have caused writers like Edwards A. Park, and A. B. Bruce
          (The Humiliation of Christ, ut sup., pp. 317-318) to speak of it
          with a tinge of contempt, it has exercised a very wide influence
          and elements of it are discoverable in many constructions which
          stand far removed from its fundamental presuppositions.

    9. Certain " Sacrificial Theories."

          The so-called " middle theory" of the Atonement, which owes its
          name to its supposed intermediate position between the " moral
          influence" theories and the doctrine of " satisfaction," seems
          to have offered attractions to the latitudinarian writers of the
          closing eighteenth and opening nineteenth centuries. At that
          time it was taught in John Balguy's Essay on Redemption (London,
          1741), Henry Taylor's Apology of Ben Mordecai (London, 1784),
          and Richard Price's Sermons on Christian Doctrine (London, 1737;
          cf. Hill's Lectures on Divinity, ed. 1851, pp. 422 sqq.). Basing
          on the conception of sacrifices which looks upon them as merely
          gifts designed to secure the good-will of the King, the
          advocates of this theory regard the work of Christ as consisting
          in the offering to God of Christ's perfect obedience even to
          death, and by it purchasing God's favor and the right to do as
          he would with those whom God gave him as a reward. By the side
          of this theory may be placed the ordinary Remonstrant theory of
          acceptilatio, which, reviving this Scotist conception, is
          willing to allow that the work of Christ was of the nature of an
          expiatory sacrifice, but is unwilling to allow that his blood
          any more than that of " bulls and goats" had intrinsic value
          equivalent. to the fault for which it was graciously accepted by
          God as an atonement. This theory may be found expounded, for
          example, in Limborch (Theologia Christiana, 4th ed., Amsterdam,
          1715, iii, chaps. xviii-xxiii). Such theories, while preserving
          the sacrificial form of the Biblical doctrine, and, with it, its
          inseparable implication that the work of Christ has as its
          primary end to affect God and secure from him favorable regard
          for man (for it is always to God that sacrifices are offered),
          yet fall so far short of the Biblical doctrine of the nature and
          effect of Christ's sacrifice as to seem little less than
          travesties of it.

    10. The Doctrine of " Satisfction."

          The Biblical doctrine of the sacrifice of Christ finds full
          recognition in no other construction than that of the
          established church-doctrine of satisfaction. According to it,
          our Lord's redeeming work is at its core a true and perfect
          sacrifice offered to God, of intrinsic value ample for the
          expiation of our guilt; and at the same time is a true and
          perfect righteousness offered to God in fulfilment of the
          demands of his law; both the one and the other being offered in
          behalf of his people, and, on being accepted by God, accruing to
          their benefit; so that by this satisfaction they are relieved at
          once from the curse of their guilt as breakers of the law, and
          from the burden of the law as a condition of life; and this by a
          work of such kind and performed in such a manner, as to carry
          home to the hearts of men a profound sense of the indefectible
          righteousness of God and to make to them a perfect revelation of
          his love; so that, by this one and indivisible work, both God is
          reconciled to us, and we, under the quickening influence of the
          Spirit bought for us by it, are reconciled to God, so making
          peace--external peace between an angry God and sinful men, and
          internal peace in the response of the human conscience to the
          restored smile of God. This doctrine, which has been
          incorporated in more or less fulness of statement in the creedal
          declarations of all the great branches of the Church, Greek,
          Latin, Lutheran, and Reformed, and which has been expounded with
          more or less insight and power by the leading doctors of the
          Churches for the last eight hundred years, was first given
          scientific statement by [707]Anselm (q.v.) in his Cur Deus homo
          (1098); but reached its complete development only at the hands
          of the so-called Protestant Scholastics of the seventeenth
          century (cf., e.g., Turretin, The Atonement of Christ, transl.
          by J. R. Willson, New York, 1859; John Owen, The Death of Death
          in the Death of Christ, 1650, Edinburgh, 1845). Among the
          numerous modern presentations of the doctrine the following may
          perhaps be most profitably consulted. Of Continental writers:

   Atonement, Day of
          ATONEMENT, DAY OF:

  Institution and Ritual.

          The great Hebrew and Jewish fast-day, occurring annually; called
          in Lev. xxiii, 27-28 yom ha-kippurim, in the Talmud simply yoma,
          "the day" ; in vulgar Hebrew yom kippur. The legal provisions
          are given in Lev. xvi (cf. Ex. xxx, 10); xxiii, 26-32; Num.
          xxix, 7-11. Since these enactments, in spite of their relative
          differences, are not sufficient to define the very important
          ritual in all details, a supplementary tradition became
          necessary; the Mishnaic treatise Yoma is devoted to the
          celebration of the day during the Second Temple. According to
          Lev. xvi, 29, xxiii, 27, Num. xxix, 7, the day fell on the tenth
          of the seventh month (Tishri); it was to be a Sabbath of rest ("
          sabbath of sabbaths," Lev. xvi, 31), on which all labor was
          prohibited, and the congregation had to meet in the sanctuary
          (Lev. xxiii, 27-28). A general fast--the only one enjoined in
          the Mosaic Law--was prescribed for the day. By this fast, the
          "afflicting of the soul," the members of the congregation were
          to bring themselves into a penitential mood appropriate to the
          serious atonement act. The day is therefore called sometimes
          simply "the fast-day" (Josephus, Ant., XIV, iv, 3, where,
          however, as in XIV, xvi, 4, the "third month" causes some
          difficulty; Philo, De septenario, 296 M) or "the fast" (Philo,
          278 M; Acts xxvii, 9); by the rabbis also "the great fast" to
          distinguish it from the fast-days which were introduced after
          the Exile. The stranger who dwelt in the land was also obliged
          to rest from work, but he was not obliged to fast (Lev. xvi,
          29).

          The rite to be performed in the sanctuary is described in Lev.
          xvi, 3-28. Aaron (i.e., the high priest), attired in plain
          priestly clothing is to offer, first for himself and his house,
          a young bullock for a sin-offering. He is to bring its blood
          into the Holy of Holies and sprinkle with it the Kapporeth, the
          expiatory covering of the ark. In the same manner he has to deal
          with the blood of the goat, appointed as a sin-offering for the
          people. With this blood the other vessels of the sanctuary also
          were afterward sprinkled. Two goats were presented before God
          for the people, and the high priest cast lots, designating the
          one goat "for Yahweh" as a sin-offering, the other "for Azazel"
          (A. V. "scapegoat;" see [709]Azazel); on this second goat the
          high priest laid his hands and confessed the sins of the people,
          which the goat was to carry away into the wilderness. Thither it
          was led by a man, so that it could not return (with the two
          goats compare the two birds, Lev. xiv, 4-7). The sin is to
          remain in the territory of the unclean desert-demon Azazel (cf.
          Zech. v, 5-11). When this act was over the burnt offering for
          the high priest and the people and other offerings were brought.
          The great importance of this day is seen from the fact that the
          high priest officiates personally, and his functions are mostly
          performed in the Holy of Holies, which he could enter only on
          this day; furthermore, from the purpose of the whole, to purify
          priest and congregation, and the habitation of God and its
          vessels, from all defilement. On this account this day is also
          referred to as a type in the New Testament (cf. especially Heb.
          ix, 7, 11 sqq., 24 sqq.; also the Epistle of Barnabas vii).

    Date of Origin.

          The antiquity of this fast-day, its Mosaic origin, and even its
          preexilic existence, is denied by Vatke (Biblische Theologie, i,
          Berlin, 1835, 548), George (Feste, Berlin, 1835, 200 sqq.),
          Graf, Wellhausen, Kuenen, Reuss, and others. It is indeed
          strange that this important festival is nowhere mentioned in
          preexilic writings except in the Law. But this may be
          accidental. At all events it is a rash inference that so solemn
          a festival must be of late origin, because the old festivals of
          the Hebrews were of a joyous character. In favor of the higher
          antiquity of this usage is the fact that the entire action takes
          place by the ark of the covenant, which did not exist after the
          Exile and of whose absence nothing is said in the Law. The
          desert-demon Azazel (for which in later times one would rather
          expect Satan as opposed to Yahweh) also points back to the
          Mosaic time of the abode in the wilderness. It may, however,
          rightly be inferred from the fact that the Day of Atonement is
          not mentioned in preexilic literature that it did not pass into
          the consciousness and life of the people, like the three great
          festivals, Passover, Pentecost, and Feast of Tabernacles. It was
          a festival connected mainly with the priesthood and sanctuary,
          hence it was more strictly observed at the center of the
          legitimate worship. There came a change in the postexilic time,
          in which the Temple at Jerusalem exercised greater influence
          upon the people. But even then we see that in spite of the
          prescribed self-mortification the people knew how to indulge in
          joyful recreation; from the Mishnah (Taanit iv, 8) we learn that
          on the Day of Atonement (no doubt in the evening, after the high
          priest had returned to his home), the maidens all went forth,
          arrayed in white garments, into the vineyards around Jerusalem,
          where they danced and sang, inviting the young men to select
          their brides (cf. Delitzsch, Zur Geschichte der jÃ¼dischen
          Poesie, Leipsic, 1836, 195-196). The Gemara finds such joy
          perfectly legitimate on a day when atonement was made for
          Israel. After the destruction of Jerusalem the celebration of
          the Day of Atonement was continued, although the sacrificial
          rites could no more be performed. The grand festival with its
          solemn earnestness had so deeply impressed itself upon the
          people, that it could not be wholly dispensed with. (For the
          later usages see Orach Chayim, translated by LÃ¶we, 150 sqq.;
          Buxtorf, Synagoga Judaica, chaps. xxv-xxvi.) In general the
          penitential prayers in the synagogue have taken the place of the
          atoning temple-sacrifices. Nevertheless, the cessation of the
          sacrifice is deplored; in some places the house-father takes a
          cock, the mother a hen, which are killed as a substitute for the
          sacrifice.

          C. Von Orelli.

          The late date of the origin of the festival would seem to be
          made certain by the following considerations: (1) Its absence
          from the list of feasts given in the earlier books can not be
          accidental, especially in view of the radical character of its
          practical prescriptions. (2) These prescriptions and their moral
          sanction were not in keeping with the spirit of the earlier
          laws, in which there is no suggestion of fasting and contrition.
          (3) Transition stages between the prophetic and the priestly
          legislation are indicated in the ideal conception of Ezekiel,
          the prophet-priest, with its two single days of atonement (xlv,
          18-20), also in the intervening institution by Ezra of a general
          fast on the twenty-fourth day of the seventh month, with no
          mention of the tenth day of the priestly code. (4) The old
          festivals of the Hebrews were of a joyous character, while the
          Levitical Day of Atonement was one of great solemnity.

          open space in front of the entrance to the church, surrounded by
          porticos, and provided with a fountain, or at least a large

          brilliant success as a controversialist, and his powerful
          eloquence in the pulpit, soon attracted attention; he was made
          chaplain to William and Mary in 1692, dean of Carlisle in 1704,
          dean of Christ Church in 1711, and bishop of Rochester and dean
          of Westminster in 1713. He was a Tory in politics, and in
          ecclesiastical affairs his sympathies were with the
          High-churchmen. The succession of George I at the death of Queen
          Anne was unfavorable to his ambition, and, as a Tory; being
          coldly received by the new king, he took his place in the
          foremost ranks of the opposition, refused in 1715 to sign the
          paper in which the bishops declared their attachment to the
          House of Brunswick, and began in 1717 to correspond directly
          with the Pretender, and carried on his intrigues so skilfully
          that his most intimate friends did not suspect him. But in 1722
          his guilt was manifested; he was committed to the Tower, and by
          an act of Parliament was banished for life in March, 1723, and
          all British subjects were forbidden to hold communication with
          him except by the royal permission. He went to the continent,
          and lived most of the time in Paris, in more or less constant
          correspondence with the Pretender, for whose sake he had
          suffered so much. The health and the death of a devoted daughter
          added to his afflictions. Atterbury was a man of restless and
          pugnacious disposition, with many striking qualities, and one of
          the foremost preachers and orators of his time. He had little
          learning, however, his talents were superficial, and his
          judgment was rash. In private life he is said to have been
          winning and amiable, and he counted among his friends most of
          the literary men of the day as well as many influential
          personages. He had much popular sympathy in his banishment. At
          his death his body was carried to England and buried privately
          in Westminster Abbey.

          The most important of Atterbury's controversial writings were:
          An Answer to Some Considerations on the Spirit of Martin Luther
          and the Original of the Reformation (Oxford, 1687), in reply to
          an attack upon the Reformation by Obadiah Walker; An Examination
          of Dr. Bentley's Dissertations on the Epistles of Phalaris and
          the Fables of Æsop (London, 1698); Rights and Privileges of an
          English Convocation Stated and Vindicated (1700). Selections
          from his sermons have been many times printed and a collected
          edition in four volumes appeared in London, 1723-37. His
          Epistolary Correspondence, Visitation Charges, Speeches, and
          Miscellanies were edited by J. Nichols (5 vols., London,
          1783-90).

   Atterbury, William Wallace
          ATTERBURY, WILLIAM WALLACE: Presbyterian; b. at Newark, N. J.,
          Aug. 4, 1823. He was educated at Yale College (B.A., 1843) and
          Yale Divinity School (1847). He held Presbyterian pastorates at
          Lansing, Mich., from 1848 to 1854 and at Madison, Ind., from
          1854 to 1866. He traveled in Europe and the East and acted as a
          supply for various pulpits at Cleveland, O., and other cities
          from 1866 to 1869, when he was chosen secretary of the New York
          Sabbath Committee. In 1898 he was relieved of much of his work
          in this capacity by the appointment of an assistant, to whom he
          relinquished his regular duties two years later. He has also
          been an active member of the United States branch of the
          Evangelical Alliance, and was its secretary in 1875. His
          writings, which are generally brief, are devoted chiefly to the
          various aspects of the Sunday question.

   Atticus
          AT´TICUS: Patriarch of Constantinople 406-425 (or 427). He was
          born at Sebaste in Armenia, repaired early to Constantinople,
          and was one of the party opposed to [710]Chrysostom (q.v.), who
          was expelled from Constantinople in June, 404; his successor,
          Arsacius, an old man of eighty years, died the following year,
          and after a few months Atticus was elevated to the patriarchate.
          He is described as a man of but moderate learning, whose sermons
          were not thought worth preserving, but possessed of much skill
          in affairs, and esteemed for charity and piety. He restored the
          name of Chrysostom to the diptychs in 412. Two of his letters
          with a fragment of a third, and two fragments of a homily on the
          birth of Christ are preserved; consult MPG, lxv, 637-652.

   Atto
          ATTO: The name of three churchmen.

          1. Bishop of Basel. See [711]Haito.

          2. Archbishop of Mainz. See [712]Hatto.

          3. Bishop of Vercelli 924-961. If his will (preserved with his
          works in MPL, cxxxiv, 9-916) is to be taken as genuine, he came
          of the family to which Desiderius, the last Lombard king,
          belonged; and this would account for his remarkable education,
          which included not only a knowledge of the Bible and the
          principal western Fathers, but Greek as well, with at least some
          works of the eastern ecclesiastical writers. He was especially
          well read in legal history, knowing the Roman, Lombard, and
          canon law. He was ordained at Milan, where he became archdeacon,
          and in 924 was advanced to the see of Vercelli. Among the
          productions of his episcopal career is his Capitulare, a series
          of instructions for the clergy, which shows him to have been a
          foe to superstition and a friend of popular education. His other
          extant works are a commentary on the Pauline epistles, following
          the older exegesis; eighteen sermons; nine letters; the treatise
          De pressuris ecclesiasticis, which pleads for the exemption of
          the clergy from the jurisdiction of secular tribunals and
          protests against lay interference with ecclesiastical elections
          and the alienation of church property; the Polypticum, which
          contains a philosophical presentation of the affairs of Italy
          from the accession of King Hugh (926) down to the repeated
          intervention of Otto I. Atto is an outspoken opponent of the
          Germans, and a partizan of Berengar of Ivrea. This work exists
          in two forms, of which the shorter is undoubtedly the authentic
          one, the other being a version edited with a view of removing
          some of its obscurities.

          at Princeton College, 1854 till his death. He was also lecturer
          in Princeton Seminary and acting president of the college. He
          contributed many articles to the religious reviews and was one
          of the editors of the Biblical Repertory (1869-71) and its
          continuation (from 1872), the Presbyterian Quarterly and

          City; b, at Red Hook, N. Y., Feb.18,1840. He was educated at
          Columbia College (B.A., 1862) and the General Theological
          Seminary (1864), and was successively rector of St. Paul's,
          Burlington, Vt. (1867-80), and Trinity, Toledo, O. (1881-90),
          until he was consecrated first bishop of the newly organized
          diocese of Kansas City in 1890.

   Atwood, Isaac Morgan
          ATWOOD, ISAAC MORGAN: Universalist; b. at Pembroke, N. Y., Mar.
          24, 1838. He was educated at Yale, but did not graduate. He was
          a tutor in Ferguson Boys' School in 1859 and principal of Corfu
          Classical Institute in 1859-60. In the following year he entered
          the Universalist ministry and until 1879 held various pastorates
          in New York, Maine, and Massachusetts. He then became president
          of the Canton (N. Y.) Theological School, where he remained
          until 1899. Since 1898 he has been general superintendent of the
          Universalist Church in the United States and Canada, of which he
          was also appointed secretary in 1905. He lectured before the St.
          Lawrence University Divinity School in 1900-06 and before the
          Lombard College Divinity School in 1906. He was vice-president
          of the Universalist General Convention in 1880-85 and is a
          member of the Advisory Board of the New York State League of
          Churches and of the committee on churches in the Religious
          Education Association. From 1867 to 1874 he edited the Christian
          Leader, of which he has since been associate editor, while in
          1886-89 he was a staff-contributor to the Independent and in
          1892-94 was on the editorial staff of the Standard Dictionary.
          He is also a member of the American Social Science Association
          and of the New York Economic Club. In theology he holds firmly
          to the cardinal doctrine of the Universalist denomination. His
          principal writings are: Have We Outgrown Christianity? (Boston,
          1870); Latest Word of Universalism (1879); Walks About Zion
          (1880); Episcopacy (1885); Revelation (1893); and Balance Sheet
          of Biblical Criticism (1896).

          ATZBERGER, LEONHARD: Roman Catholic; b. at Velden (a village
          near Vilsviburg, 42 m. n.e. of Munich) July 23, 1854. He was
          educated at the Gymnasium and Lyceum of Freising and at the
          University of Munich. He was ordained to the priesthood in 1879,
          and three years later became privat-docent at Munich, where he
          was university preacher in 1886. In 1888 he was appointed
          associate professor of theology at the same university, and was
          promoted to full professor in 1894. He has written Die
          Logoslehre des heiligen Athanasius (Munich, 1880); Die
          Unsündlichkeit Christi (1883); Christliche Eschatologie in den
          Stadien ihrer Offenbarung im Alten and Neuen Testament

   Auberlen, Karl August
          AUBERLEN, ?u´ber-len, KARL AUGUST: Theologian; b. at Fellbach,
          near Stuttgart, Nov. 19, 1824; d. at Basel May 2, 1864. He
          studied in the seminary of Blaubeuren 1837-41, and theology at
          Tübingen 1841-45; became repetent in theology at Tübingen 1849,
          and professor at Basel 1851. As a young man he was attracted by
          the views of Goethe and Hegel and enthusiastic for the criticism
          of Baur; but he later became an adherent of the old Württemberg
          circle of theologians--Bengel, Oetinger, Roos, etc. He published
          Die Theosophie Oetingers (Tübingen, 1847); Der Prophet Daniel
          und die Offenbarung Johannis (Basel, 1854; Eng. transl., by
          Adolph Saphir, The Prophecies of Daniel and the Revelation,
          Edinburgh, 1874; 2d German ed., 1857); Die götttiche Offenbarung
          (i, Basel, 1861; Eng. transl., with memoir, Edinburgh, 1867). A
          volume of sermons appeared in 1845; a volume of lectures on the
          Christian faith in 1861.

          1652. He became minister at Chartres 1618, and at Charenton
          (Paris) 1631. To prove that the doctrine of the Reformed Church
          concerning the Eucharist was the same as that of the ancient
          Church, he wrote Conformité de la créance de l'Église avec celle
          de St. Augustin sur le sacrement de l'Eucharistie (Paris, 1626),
          afterward enlarged and entitled L'Eucharistie de l'ancienne
          Église (1629). The work attracted attention and caused much
          controversy.

          writer; b. at St. Maury, near Pons (50 m. n. of Bordeaux), in
          Saintonge, Feb. 8, 1552; d. at Geneva Apr. 29, 1630. He grew up
          under influences which tended to make him a strong partizan in
          the religious disputes of the time; studied for a period under
          Beza at Geneva, but ran away to join a Huguenot regiment at the
          age of fifteen; fought with distinction through the wars which
          ended in the accession of Henry IV, and, notwithstanding his
          rough manners and unpolitic candor, retained the friendship of
          the king till his death. After the abjuration of Henry he
          retired from the court, and devoted the later years of his life
          to literary work. In 1620 to escape threatening persecution he
          took refuge in Geneva. One of his sons was the father of Madame
          de Maintenon. His most important work was the Histoire
          universelle depuis 1560 jusqu'à l'an 1601 (3 vols., Maillé,
          1616-20; new ed., by A. de Ruble, 9 vols., Paris, 1886-98). The
          Tragiques (1616; ed. C. Read, 2 vols., Paris, 1896), a long epic
          poem, treats in bad verse of the same subject as the Histoire
          universelle. These works, little read when published, and almost
          forgotten during the eighteenth century, in modern times have
          come to be regarded as valuable sources of French history. His
          complete works have been edited by E. Réaume and F. de Caussade
          (6 vols., Paris, 1873-92).

   Auburn Declaration
          AUBURN DECLARATION: An incident of the Old and New School
          controversy in the Presbyterian Church in 1837. The General
          Assembly of that year, controlled by the Old School party, "
          exscinded" the synods of Utica, Geneva, and Genesee, in New
          York, and Western Reserve, in Ohio, declaring them to be "
          neither in form nor in fact a part of the Presbyterian Church."
          On the 17th of the following August a convention of about two
          hundred clergymen and a number of prominent laymen, representing
          all the presbyteries in these synods, met in Auburn, N. Y., to
          repel the charge of unsoundness in the faith and set forth the
          views they actually held. A declaration was adopted, consisting
          of sixteen articles, corresponding to a similar list of sixteen
          heresies alleged to be held by the New School churches, which
          had been presented to the Assembly and had been the basis of its
          action. Replying to the first of the charges, that it was taught
          " that God would have been glad to prevent the existence of sin
          in our world, but was not able without destroying the moral
          agency of man; or that, for aught that appeals in the Bible, sin
          is incidental to any wise, moral system," the members of the
          convention declared that they believed that " God permitted the
          introduction of sin, not because he was unable to prevent it
          consistently with the moral freedom of his creatures, but for
          wise and benevolent reasons which he has not revealed" (art. i).
          In replying to the other charges, the convention pronounced
          fully in the sense of the Westminster Symbols. With a perhaps
          unconscious supralapsarianism, they put the doctrine of election
          first in order, and all the other facts in the process of
          redemption after it; so the arrangement suggests that it was the
          primary purpose of God to save a definite number of men out of a
          race to be thereafter created; that in pursuance of this purpose
          man was formed, the fall decreed, and an atonement provided
          sufficient to meet the case of that predestined number, and no
          others. No affirmation of the universality of the atonement is
          found among these sixteen propositions. Original sin, total
          depravity, vicarious atonement, Christ's intercession for the
          elect previous to their conversion, absolute dependence upon
          irresistible divine grace for the renewal of the heart,
          instantaneous regeneration, etc., all these dogmas are
          emphatically affirmed. " All who are saved are indebted from
          first to last to the grace and spirit of God and the reason why
          God does not save all is not that he wants the power to do it,
          but that in his wisdom he does not see fit to exert that power
          further than he actually does" (art. xiii). In short, the Auburn
          Declaration rises well up to the high-water mark of the
          Calvinistic theology and was indorsed by the General Assembly
          (Old School) in 1868 as containing " all the fundamentals of the
          Calvinistic Creed."

   Audians
          AUDIANS: The followers of a certain Audius, according to
          Epiphanius (Hær., lxx; followed by Augustine, Hær., 1),
          Theodoret (Hist. eccl., iv, 10; Hær. fab., iv, 10), and Ephraem
          Syrus (Serm., xxiv, Adv. hær.), who state that Audius was a
          Mesopotamian, a layman who lived " in the time of Arius," that
          he declaimed against the worldly conduct of the clergy, founded
          an ascetic sect, and, in his old age banished to Scythia, did
          successful missionary work among the Goths. When Epiphanius
          wrote (c. 375) the sect was practically extinct in its original
          home. He praises the orthodoxy of Audius and his exemplary life,
          but blames him and his followers for holding anthropomorphic
          views of God and for being quartodecimans.

   Audentia Episcopalis
          AUDIENTIA EPISCOPALIS: The name given by the code of Justinian
          to the bishop's power of hearing and deciding judicial cases.
          This power in the early Church was based upon such passages of
          Scripture as Matt. xviii, 18-16 and I Cor. vi, 1-6. The Didache
          testifies to the exercise of this power by the presbyters, or by
          the college of presbyters with the bishop at their head; and the
          Apostolic Constitutions forbid Christians to go to law, even
          with the heathen, before a pagan tribunal. Small differences are
          to be adjusted by the deacons; the more important are to be laid
          before the bishop sitting in judgment with his clergy every
          Monday; he is to decide after careful investigation and orderly
          examination of witnesses, by a procedure following closely that
          of the secular tribunals. The enforcement of his sentence by the
          civil power could, of course, only follow when the act took on
          the form of a stipulation, which could be brought before the
          courts. But with the public recognition of Christianity,
          Constantine gave the bishops a real judicial power. The first of
          his three edicts on this subject is lost, and there have been
          many controversies about the other two, of 321 and 333. Either
          party might appeal to the bishop at any stage in the
          proceedings, and his decision was final, though it required
          enforcement by the civil tribunals, for even Constantine gave
          the bishop no imperium. This privilege was abolished by Arcadius
          for the East (398) and by Honorius for the West (408); the
          regulations established by Valentinian III in 452 provide that
          no one shall be forced to appear before the episcopal tribunal,
          and reduce the power to something more like its original limits.
          In the form then fixed, it remained in Justinian's code. The
          bishops attempted, in virtue of their disciplinary authority
          over their clergy, to compel the latter to submit even their
          civil differences to episcopal judgment; this Justinian
          approved, and extended to suits by laymen against clerics. The
          representatives of the ecclesiastical tendency in the Frankish
          kingdom went back to the edicts of Constantine. Thus Florus of
          Lyons, in his commentary on the constitutions published later by
          Sirmond, disregarded the facts that these had been reversed by
          Constantine's successors, and that in any case the edicts of
          Roman emperors were no authority for the Frankish kingdom; and
          Benedictus Levita wrote an introduction to the law of 333 in
          which he asserted that Charlemagne had proclaimed this as the
          law of his empire. Regino only quotes one passage from the edict
          of 333; but later collections down to that of Gratian include
          the whole of what is given by Benedictus Levita; and Innocent
          III (1198-1216) relied upon it as the basis of his Denunciatio
          evangelica (see [716]Jurisdiction, Ecclesiastical). But the
          later development of systematic ecclesiastical judicature
          absorbed the function of the bishop as arbiter.

   Augsburg, Bishopric of
          AUGSBURG, BISHOPRIC OF: The origin of the Augsburg bishopric is
          lost in obscurity, but there is no doubt that it goes back to
          the days of the Roman empire. The importance of the colony of
          Augusta Vindelicorum is sufficient to account for the early
          introduction of Christianity there. That it was evangelized from
          the north of Italy is probable from the fact that it originally
          formed a part of the ecclesiastical province of Aquileia. It
          survived the downfall of the empire, the Alemannic conquest, and
          the subjection of the Alemanni in their turn to Frankish rule.
          The early boundaries of the diocese, including not only Suabian
          but also Bavarian and Frankish territory, give further evidence
          that it was in existence before the establishment of Teutonic
          dominion. The present diocese has lost a few Austrian districts
          and those parts which are now in Württemberg, but has retained
          so much of the old diocese of Constance as is now Bavarian. From
          the foundation of the archbishopric of Mainz, Augsburg was a
          suffragan see under its jurisdiction until the reorganization of
          1817 transferred it to the newly founded province of Munich. The
          secular jurisdiction which the bishops of Augsburg had exercised
          for more than a thousand years was taken from them in 1802 and
          transferred to the Elector of Bavaria.

          History of the Confession and the Apology (§ 4).

    1. Origin of the Confession.

          On Jan. 21, 1530, the Emperor Charles V issued letters from
          Bologna, inviting the German diet to meet in Augsburg Apr. 8,
          for the purpose of discussing and deciding various important
          questions. Although the writ of invitation was couched in very
          peaceful language, it was received with suspicion by some of the
          Evangelicals. The far-seeing Landgrave of Hesse hesitated to
          attend the diet, but the Elector John of Saxony, who received
          the writ Mar. 11, on Mar. 14 directed Luther, Jonas, Bugenhagen,
          and Melanchthon to meet in Torgau, where he was, and present a
          summary of the Protestant faith, to be laid before the emperor
          at the diet. This summary has received the name of the " Torgau
          Articles." On Apr. 3 the elector and reformers started from
          Torgau and reached Coburg on Apr. 23. There Luther was left
          behind. The rest reached Augsburg May 2. On the journey
          Melanchthon worked on an " apology," using the Torgau articles,
          and sent his draft to Luther at Coburg on May 11, who approved
          it. Several alterations were suggested to Melanchthon in his
          conferences with Jonas, the Saxon chancellor Brück, the
          conciliatory bishop Stadion of Augsburg, and the imperial
          secretary Alfonso Valdez. On June 23 the final form of the text
          was adopted in the presence of the Elector John of Saxony, the
          Landgrave Philip of Hesse, the Margrave George of Brandenburg,
          the Dukes Ernest and Francis of Lüneburg, the representatives of
          Nuremberg and Reutlingen, and other counselors, besides twelve
          theologians. After the reading the confession was signed by the
          Elector John of Saxony, Margrave George of Brandenburg, Duke
          Ernest of Lüneburg, the Landgrave Philip of Hesse, the Prince
          Wolfgang of Anhalt, the representatives of Nuremberg and
          Reutlingen, and probably also by the electoral prince John
          Frederick and Duke Francis of Lüneburg. During the diet the
          cities of Weissenburg, Heilbronn, Kempten, and Windesheim also
          expressed their concurrence with the confession. The emperor had
          ordered the confession to be presented to him at the next
          session, June 24; but when the evangelical princes asked that it
          be read in public, their petition was refused, and efforts were
          made to prevent the public reading of the document altogether.
          The evangelical princes, however, declared that they would not
          part with the confession until its reading should be allowed.
          The 25th was then fixed for the day of its presentation. In
          order to exclude the people, the little chapel of the episcopal
          palace was appointed in place of the spacious city hall, where
          the meetings of the diet were held. The two Saxon chancellors
          Brück and Beyer, the one with the Latin copy, the other with the
          German, stepped into the middle of the assembly, and against the
          wish of the emperor the German text was read. The reading lasted
          two hours and was so distinct that every word could be heard
          outside. The reading being over, the copies were handed to the
          emperor. The German he gave to the imperial chancellor, the
          Elector of Mainz, the Latin he took away. Neither of the copies
          is now extant.

    2. Its Character and Contents.

          The history of its origin shows that the document presented at
          Augsburg was confession and apology at the same time, destined
          to serve the cause of peace and to refute the charge of
          deviating from the ancient doctrine of the Church and of having
          communion with sectaries; and the entire first part (Articuli
          præcipui fidei, arts. i-xxi) was intended to prove that the
          Evangelicals agreed with the Catholic teaching, and wherever
          they differed from the transmitted form of doctrine they wished
          to restore the original, genuine teaching of the Church. The
          second part (Articuli in quibus recensentur abusus mutati,
          xxii-xxviii) treats of abuses and proves how certain general
          abuses must be abolished for the sake of conscience and that
          such action was not only supported by Scripture but also by the
          practise of the ancient Church and the acknowledged teachers of
          the Church.

          [The first part of the Confession, which treats of the chief
          articles of faith, speaks of the following subjects: art. i, of
          God; ii, of original sin; iii, of the Son of God; iv, of
          justification; v, of the ministry of the Church; vi, of the new
          obedience; vii, of the Church; viii, what the Church is; ix, of
          baptism; x, of the Lord's Supper; xi, of confession; xii, of
          repentance; xiii, of the use of sacraments; xiv, of
          ecclesiastical orders; xv, of ecclesiastical rites; xvi, of
          civil affairs; xvii, of Christ's return to judgment; xviii, of
          free will; xix, of the cause of sin; xx, of good works; xxi, of
          the worship of saints. The second part recounts the abuses which
          have been corrected: art. i, of both kinds in the Lord's Supper;
          ii, of the marriage of priests; iii, of the mass; iv, of
          confession; v, of the distinction of meats and of traditions;
          vi, of monastic vows; vii, of ecclesiastical power.]

    3. Origin of the Apology.

          The hope that the opponents of the Confession would make a
          profession of their faith was not fulfilled. They refused to be
          considered as a party. Nevertheless, it was decided to have the
          Confession examined by intelligent and unprejudiced scholars,
          who were to acknowledge that which was correct and to refute
          that which was against the Christian faith and the Christian
          Church (Ficker: Die Confutation des Augsburger Bekenntnisses,
          Leipsic, 1891, pp. 15 sqq.). Among the twenty scholars selected
          by Campeggi were some of the most malicious opponents of Luther,
          like Eck, Faber, Cochlæus, Dietenberger, and Wimpina, and their
          refutation (reprinted by Ficker) was of such a character that it
          was rejected by the emperor and the estates siding with Rome. A
          revision, however, was accepted, and as Responsio Augustanæ
          confessionis it was read on Aug. 3, 1530, in the same room in
          which the Confession had been read. Since this reply, the
          Confutatio pontifica, as it afterward came to be known (the
          Latin text in Kolde; 141 sqq.), was adopted by the emperor as
          his own and conformity to it was demanded, the Protestants
          thought necessary to refute it. No copy of the confutation was
          given to the Evangelicals, and, as negotiations led to no
          result, Melanchthon and others were requested to prepare an "
          Apology of the Confession," that is to say, a refutation of the
          charges of the Confutatio, and the same was approved by the
          Evangelical estates. In the circular for dismissing the diet
          which was presented to the estates, Sept. 22, the remark was
          found that the evangelical confession " had been refuted." This
          remark was contradicted by the chancellor Brück in the name of
          the Evangelicals, who presented at the same time Melanchthon's
          apology. But the emperor, to whom Ferdinand had whispered
          something, refused to accept it. This is the so-called Prima
          delineatio apologiæ, first made known in Latin by Chyträus
          (Historia Augustanæ confessionis, Frankfort, 1578, 328 sqq.;
          best edition of the Latin and German text in the Corpus
          reformatorum, xxvii, 275 sqq.). Subsequently Melanchthon
          received a copy of the Confutation, which led to many
          alterations in the first draft of the Apology. It was then
          published in 1531 under the title Apologia confessionis
          Augustinæ. It follows the articles of the Augustana (i.e., the
          Augsburg Confession), and on account of its theological
          exposition is rather a doctrinal work than a confession.

    4. History of the Confession and the Apology.

          Although the emperor prohibited the printing of the evangelical
          confession without his special permission, during the diet six
          German editions and one in Latin were published (cf. Corpus
          reformatorum, xxvi, 478 sqq.). Their inaccuracy and
          incorrectness induced Melanchthon to prepare an edition to which
          he added the Apology. Thus originated the no-called editio
          princeps of the Augustana, and Apology, which was published in
          the spring of 1531. This edition was regarded as the authentic
          reproduction of the faith professed before the emperor and
          empire. Whereas the first recension of the Apology was composed
          in behalf of the evangelical states, the edition now issued by
          Melanchthon was evidently a private work to which he attached
          his name as author, which is not the case with the Augustana.
          Nevertheless, the Apology was accepted everywhere and the German
          translation of Justus Jonas made it accessible to the laity. In
          1532 the Apology was officially accepted at Schweinfurt by the
          evangelical estates as an " apology and exposition of the
          confession along with the confession." Ever since the Augustana
          and Apology have been regarded as the official principal
          confessions of the nascent Evangelical church. Their recognition
          was a condition of membership in the Schmalkald League; both
          were adopted is the Concord of Wittenberg of 1536 and again at
          Schmalkald in 1537. Meanwhile Melanchthon worked continually to
          improve the text. The German edition of the Augustana published
          in 1533 shows changes in arts. iv, v, vi, xii, xv, xx, which are
          of no doctrinal consequence. The same is the case with
          subsequent editions. More important was the new Latin edition of
          1540, where the apology is said to have been diligenter
          recognita. But the Augustana appears here in such a form,
          especially in art. x, that it afterward received the name
          variata. Although attention had been called in 1537 to
          Melanchthon's changes in the text, and the Elector John
          Frederick criticized them as arrogant (Corpus reformatorum, iii,
          366), we find that the "Variata" when published gave no offense.
          The assertion that Luther condemned it, can not be confirmed
          (cf. Köllner, Symbolik, i, Hamburg, 1837, 239). The new edition
          was used freely, as a new edition is preferable to an older;
          even such strict Lutherans as Johann Brenz praised Melanchthon
          for it (Corpus reformatorum, iv, 737). Even the fact that Johann
          Eck at the Worms Colloquy in 1541 mentioned the change of the
          original text (Corpus reformatorum, iv, 34 sqq.; Ranke, Deutsche
          Geschichte, iv, 176) had so little effect upon the
          contemporaries and Melanchthon, that when a new edition became
          necessary in 1542 the latter introduced other changes. After the
          death of Luther, when dogmatic controversies widened the chasm
          between Melanchthonians and the strict Lutherans and the edition
          of 1540 became the party-symbol of the former and later also of
          the Crypto-Calvinists, it naturally became an object of
          suspicion to the stricter Lutherans and it was but natural that
          in preparing the Book of Concord the original text was adopted.
          The Latin text represents the editio princeps of 1531, whereas
          the German was made from a Mainz copy.

   Augsburg, Interim of
          AUGSBURG, INTERIM OF. See [719]Interim.

   Augsburg, Religious Peace of
          AUGSBURG, RELIGIOUS PEACE OF: A convention concluded in a diet
          at Augsburg Sept. 25, 1555, intended to settle the religious
          question in Germany. After his victory over the Schmalkald
          League (1547), the Emperor Charles V thought he was near his
          goal, the religious and ecclesiastical unity of the empire. But
          the desertion of Duke Maurice of Saxony, and the Treaty of
          Passau (1552) changed the situation, because by the latter
          public recognition was given to the Lutheran faith as among the
          ecclesiastical institutions of the empire. Such recognition
          meant a complete rupture with the ecclesiastical and political
          development inherited from the Middle Ages, and a peace on the
          basis of the equal recognition of both religions was highly
          unacceptable to the emperor. As he could not prevent it, he
          withdrew from the negotiations and transferred all power to his
          brother Ferdinand, who felt like himself, but was ready to
          accept the inevitable. When the diet at Augsburg was finally
          opened Feb. 5, 1555, Ferdinand's endeavor was directed more
          toward strengthening the peace of the country than to religion.
          But the Protestants insisted upon settling the question of the
          religious peace first, without regard to a council. The opposite
          party yielded reluctantly. With the exception of the Augsburg
          cardinal, Otto von Truchsess, the spiritual princes agreed that
          "there should be concluded and established a continual, firm,
          unconditional peace lasting forever," between the professors "of
          the old religion and the estates belonging to the Augsburg
          Confession." The stipulations of the peace were as follows: All
          adherents of the Augsburg Confession were to be included,
          without regard to its various editions (see [720]Augsburg
          Confession and its Apology), those sects alone being excluded
          which had been condemned by decrees of the diet, as already
          provided in the Treaty of Passau. Spiritual jurisdiction in
          Protestant territory was to be suspended, but the chapters were
          not to be expelled from Protestant cities. Confiscated spiritual
          estates, which did not belong to those immediately subject to
          the emperor and which at the time of the Treaty of Passau or
          later were no longer in the possession of the clergy were to
          remain in the hands of the Evangelicals. To the secular estates
          alone was unrestricted freedom of religion granted, and they
          were masters of the religion of their subjects, for "where there
          is one Lord, there should be one religion." The conversion of a
          spiritual prince to the Augsburg Confession, according to the
          reservatum ecclesiasticum added by the king, carried with it the
          loss of his spiritual dignity and his office as well as of the
          imperial fief. The imperial chamber, to which Protestants were
          now admitted, was to watch over the continuance of the peace.
          Considered all in all, the success of the Protestants was small.
          Protestantism was deprived of the chance to spread, by the
          reservatum ecclesiasticum, a large part of Germany was
          permanently assigned to Catholicism, and the Lutheran
          reformation, which had hardly begun, was broken off, not to be
          resumed. The little that had been gained was established, but
          the immediate effect was the outbreak of the internal doctrinal
          controversies and the rise of the official Church.

          (T. Kolde.)

          In Austria and its dependencies Lutheranism profited greatly by
          the peace. Many nobles having become Protestant claimed and
          exercised the right to promote the Protestant cause in their
          possessions. To be sure, the Hapsburgs claimed for themselves
          the exclusive right to determine the religion of the people in
          all their dependencies; but they found it impossible to enforce
          their views upon the nobles.

          AUGUSTI, au´´gus´ti, JOHANN CHRISTIAN WILHELM: Theologian and
          archeologist: b. at Eschenberga, Saxe-Coburg-Gotha, Oct. 27,
          1772; d. at Coblenz Apr. 28, 1841. He studied theology at Jena
          and became professor of philosophy there 1800, of Oriental
          languages 1823; professor of theology at Breslau 1812, at Bonn
          1819, where he represented the older school of theology by the
          side of younger teachers such as Lücke, Gieseler, and Nitzsch;
          in 1828 he became councilor of the consistory of Coblenz, in
          1835 president. Among his works are Denkwürdigkeiten aus der
          christlichen Archäologie (12 vols., Leipsic, 1817-31); Lehrbuch
          der christlichen Dogmengeschichte (1805; 4th ed., 1835);

          widely used of his works was the Handbuch der christlichen
          Archäologie (3 vols., 1836-37); he also assisted de Wette in
          translating the Bible into German (1809-14). Adaptations of his
          works on archeology were published in English by J. E. Riddle
          (London, 1839) and L. Coleman (Andover, 1841).

          AUGUSTINE OF ALVELDT: German Franciscan; b. at Alfeld (27 m. s.
          of Hanover), Prussia, c. 1480; d. probably in Halle after 1532.
          He first appears in Leipsic, where he was a reader in theology
          at a convent. He is the Minorite to whom Erasmus refers in the
          Spongia. He is known chiefly as an opponent of Luther. On Jan.
          20, 1522, he engaged in a public disputation at Weimar with
          Johann Lange in defense of cloister-life. He became guardian of
          the Franciscan cloister at Halle about 1523. His works have now
          no value, except as curiosities.

   Augustine, Saint, of Canterbury
          AUGUSTINE (AUSTIN), SAINT, OF CANTERBURY: The apostle to the
          English and first archbishop of Canterbury; d. at Canterbury May
          26, 604 or 605. When first heard of he was præpositus (prior) of
          the monastery of St. Andrew, founded by Gregory the Great in
          Rome, and was sent by Gregory in 596 at the head of a mission of
          forty monks to preach to the Anglo-Saxons. They lost heart on
          the way and Augustine went back to Rome from Provence and asked
          that the mission be given up. The pope, however, commanded and
          encouraged them to proceed, and they landed on the Island of
          Thanet in the spring of 597. They found the way not unprepared
          as Bertha, daughter of Charibert of Paris and wife of Ethelbert,
          king of Kent, was a Christian and was allowed to worship God in
          her own way. Ethelbert permitted the missionaries to settle and
          preach in his town of Canterbury and before the end of the year
          he was converted and Augustine was consecrated bishop at Arles.
          At Christmas 10,000 of the king's subjects were baptized.
          Augustine sent a report of his success to Gregory with certain
          rather petty questions concerning his work, which do not
          indicate a great mind. In 601 [722]Mellitus (q.v.) and others
          brought the pope's replies, with the pallium for Augustine and a
          present of sacred vessels, vestments, relics, books, and the
          like. Gregory directed the new archbishop to ordain as soon as
          possible twelve suffragan bishops and to send a bishop to York,
          who should also have twelve suffragans,--a plan which was not
          carried out, nor was the primatial see established at London as
          Gregory intended. More practicable were the pope's mandates
          concerning heathen temples and usages; the former were to be
          consecrated to Christian service and the latter, so far as
          possible, to be transformed into dedication ceremonies or feasts
          of martyrs, since "he who would climb to a lofty height must go
          up by steps, not leaps" (letter of Gregory to Mellitus, in Bede,
          i, 30). Augustine reconsecrated and rebuilt an old church at
          Canterbury as his cathedral and founded a monastery in
          connection with it. He also restored a church and founded the
          monastery of St. Peter and St. Paul outside the walls. His
          attempts to effect a union with the old British Church in Wales
          failed. See [723]Anglo-Saxons, Conversion of the; [724]Celtic
          Church in Britain and Ireland.

  I. Life.

    1. Formative Period.

    1. Sources for a Biography.

          Augustine, bishop of Hippo (Lat. Augustinus; the prænomen
          Aurelius given by Orosius, Prosper, and others, has no evidence
          in his own writings, or in letters addressed to him), is not
          only the most important of the Fathers of the early Church, but
          at the same time the one best known through a variety of
          specially full and useful sources. He was one of the most
          fertile writers of the early period, and the multiplication of
          his manuscripts has allowed his works to come down relatively
          complete in number. Among these, the Confessiones and the
          Retractationes have a unique value for the history of primitive
          church life, while others are full of biographical details.
          Moreover, a countryman of his, Possidius, Bishop of Calama, who
          was in close relations with him for forty years and present at
          his death, has given us a life which deserves a place of honor
          in early hagiography. We have thus remarkably satisfactory
          sources both as to Augustine's life and as to his literary work.
          He himself, in his Confessiones (written between 397 and 400),
          has described the events of his first thirty-three years; and
          for the rest of his life we have both the treatises and letters,
          which begin about the time when the Confessiones stop, as well
          as the biography by Possidius. For the historical understanding
          of his works, as well as for their dates and criticism,
          Augustine himself has left in the Retractationes (completed at
          the end of 427) a unique guide. In this review he has taken up
          each one of his writings, except the letters and sermons, in
          chronological order, with the purpose of explaining things which
          might be misconstrued or of restating them in a better way; and
          Possidius has given us also a comprehensive and systematic list
          of all the writings, as an appendix to his biography.

    2. Boyhood. Parental Influences.

          Augustine is the first ecclesiastical author the whole course of
          whose development can be clearly traced, as well as the first in
          whose case we are able to determine the exact period covered by
          his career, to the very day. He informs us himself that he was
          born at Thagaste (Tagaste; now Suk Arras), in proconsular
          Numidia, Nov. 13, 354; he died at Hippo Regius (just south of
          the modern Bona) Aug. 28, 430. [Both Suk Arras and Bona are in
          the present Algeria, the first 60 m. w. by s. and the second 65
          m. w. of Tunis, the ancient Carthage.] His father Patricius, as
          a member of the council, belonged to the influential classes of
          the place; he was, however, in straitened circumstances, and
          seems to have had nothing remarkable either in mental equipment
          or in character, but to have been a lively, sensual,
          hot-tempered person, entirely taken up with his worldly
          concerns, and unfriendly to Christianity until the close of his
          life; he became a catechumen shortly before Augustine reached
          his sixteenth year (369-370). To his mother Monnica (so the
          manuscripts write her name, not Monica; b. 331, d. 387)
          Augustine later believed that he owed what he became. But though
          she was evidently an honorable, loving, self-sacrificing, and
          able woman, she was not always the ideal of a Christian mother
          that tradition has made her appear. Her religion in earlier life
          has traces of formality and worldliness about it; her ambition
          for her son seems at first to have had little moral earnestness
          and she regretted his Manicheanism more than she did his early
          sensuality. It seems to have been through Ambrose and Augustine
          that she attained the mature personal piety with which she left
          the world. Of Augustine as a boy his parents were intensely
          proud. He received his first education at Thagaste, learning to
          read and write, as well as the rudiments of Greek and Latin
          literature, from teachers who followed the old traditional pagan
          methods. He seems to have had no systematic instruction in the
          Christian faith at this period, and though enrolled among the
          catechumens, apparently was near baptism only when an illness
          and his own boyish desire made it temporarily probable.

    3. Schooling and Early Marriage.

          His father, delighted with his son's progress in his studies,
          sent him first to the neighboring Madaura, and then to Carthage,
          some two days' journey away. A year's enforced idleness, while
          the means for this more expensive schooling were being
          accumulated, proved a time of moral deterioration; but we must
          be on our guard against forming our conception of Augustine's
          vicious living from the Confessiones alone. To speak, as Mommsen
          does, of " frantic dissipation" is to attach too much weight to
          his own penitent expressions of self-reproach. Looking back as a
          bishop, he naturally regarded his whole life up to the "
          conversion" which led to his baptism as a period of wandering
          from the right way; but not long after this conversion, he
          judged differently, and found, from one point of view, the
          turning point of his career in his taking up philosophy in his
          nineteenth year. This view of his early life, which may be
          traced also in the Confessiones, is probably nearer the truth
          than the popular conception of a youth sunk in all kinds of
          immorality. When he began the study of rhetoric at Carthage, it
          is true that (in company with comrades whose ideas of pleasure
          were probably much more gross than his) he drank of the cup of
          sensual pleasure. But his ambition prevented him from allowing
          his dissipations to interfere with his studies. His son
          Adeodatus was born in the summer of 372, and it was probably the
          mother of this child whose charms enthralled him soon after his
          arrival at Carthage about the end of 370. But he remained
          faithful to her until about 385, and the grief which he felt at
          parting from her shows what the relation had been. In the view
          of the civilization of that period, such a monogamous union was
          distinguished from a formal marriage only by certain legal
          restrictions, in addition to the informality of its beginning
          and the possibility of a voluntary dissolution. Even the Church
          was slow to condemn such unions absolutely, and Monnica seems to
          have received the child and his mother publicly at Thagaste. In
          any case Augustine was known to Carthage not as a roysterer but
          as a quiet honorable student. He was, however, internally
          dissatisfied with his life. The Hortensius of Cicero, now lost
          with the exception of a few fragments, made a deep impression on
          him. To know the truth was henceforth his deepest wish. About
          the time when the contrast between his ideals and his actual
          life became intolerable, he learned to conceive of Christianity
          as the one religion which could lead him to the attainment of
          his ideal. But his pride of intellect held him back from
          embracing it earnestly; the Scriptures could not bear comparison
          with Cicero; he sought for wisdom, not for humble submission to
          authority.

    4. Comes Under Manichean Influences.

          In this frame of mind he was ready to be affected by the
          Manichean propaganda which was then actively carried on in
          Africa, without apparently being much hindered by the imperial
          edict against assemblies of the sect. Two things especially
          attracted him to the Manicheans: they felt at liberty to
          criticize the Scriptures, particularly the Old Testament, with
          perfect freedom; and they held chastity and self denial in
          honor. The former fitted in with the impression which the Bible
          had made on Augustine himself; the latter corresponded closely
          to his mood at the time. The prayer which he tells us he had in
          his heart then, " Lord, give me chastity and temperance, but not
          now," may be taken as the formula which represents the attitude
          of many of the Manichean auditores. Among these Augustine was
          classed during his nineteenth year; but he went no further,
          though he held firmly to Manicheanism for nine years, during
          which he endeavored to convert all his friends, scorned the
          sacraments of the Church, and held frequent disputations with
          catholic believers.

    5. Teaches at Thagaste.

          Having finished his studies, he returned to Thagaste and began
          to teach grammar, living in the house of Romanianus, a prominent
          citizen who had been of much service to him since his father's
          death, and whom he converted to Manicheanism. Monnica deeply
          grieved at her son's heresy, forbade him her house, until
          reassured by a vision that promised his restoration. She
          comforted herself also by the word of a certain bishop (probably
          of Thagaste) that " the child of so many tears could not be
          lost." He seems to have spent little more than a year in
          Thagaste, when the desire for a wider field, together with the
          death of a dear friend, moved him to return to Carthage as a
          teacher of rhetoric.

    6. Rejection of Manicheanism. Removal to Rome.

          The next period was a time of diligent study, and produced
          (about the end of 380) the treatise, long since lost, De pulchro
          et apto. Meanwhile the hold of Manicheanism on him was
          loosening. Its feeble cosmology and metaphysics had long since
          failed to satisfy him, and the astrological superstitions
          springing from the credulity of its disciples offended his
          reason. The members of the sect, unwilling to lose him, had
          great hopes from a meeting with their leader Faustus of Mileve;
          but when he came to Carthage in the autumn of 382, he too proved
          disappointing, and Augustine ceased to be at heart a Manichean.
          He was not yet, however, prepared to put anything in the place
          of the doctrine he had held, and remained in outward communion
          with his former associates while he pursued his search for
          truth. Soon after his Manichean convictions had broken down, he
          left Carthage for Rome, partly, it would seem, to escape the
          preponderating influence of his mother on a mind which craved
          perfect freedom of investigation. Here he was brought more than
          ever, by obligations of friendship and gratitude, into close
          association with Manicheans, of whom there were many in Rome,
          not merely auditores but perfecti or fully initiated members.
          This did not last long, however, for the prefect Symmachus sent
          him to Milan, certainly before the beginning of 385, in answer
          to a request for a professor of rhetoric.

    7. Life Under Ambrose at Milan.

          The change of residence completed Augustine's separation from
          Manicheanism. He listened to the preaching of Ambrose and by it
          was made acquainted with the allegorical interpretation of the
          Scriptures and the weakness of the Manichean Biblical criticism,
          but he was not yet ready to accept catholic Christianity. His
          mind was still under the influence of the skeptical philosophy
          of the later Academy. This was the least satisfactory stage in
          his mental development, though his external circumstances were
          increasingly favorable. He had his mother again with him now,
          and shared a house and garden with her and his devoted friends
          Alypius and Nebridius, who had followed him to Milan; his
          assured social position is shown also by the fact that, in
          deference to his mother's entreaties, he was formally betrothed
          to a woman of suitable station. As a catechumen of the Church,
          he listened regularly to the sermons of Ambrose. The bishop,
          though as yet he knew nothing of Augustine's internal struggles,
          had welcomed him in the friendliest manner both for his own and
          for Monnica's sake. Yet Augustine was attracted only by
          Ambrose's eloquence, not by his faith; now he agreed, and now he
          questioned. Morally his life was perhaps at its lowest point. On
          his betrothal, he had put away the mother of his son; but
          neither the grief which he felt at this parting nor regard for
          his future wife, who was as yet too young for marriage,
          prevented him from taking a new concubine for the two
          intervening years. Sensuality, however, began to pall upon him,
          little as he cared to struggle against it. His idealism was by
          no means dead; he told Romanian, who came to Milan at this time
          on business, that he wished he could live altogether in
          accordance with the dictates of philosophy; and a plan was even
          made for the foundation of a community retired from the world,
          which should live entirely for the pursuit of truth. With this
          project his intention of marriage and his ambition interfered,
          and Augustine was further off than ever from peace of mind.

    8. Attracted to Neoplatonism.

          In his thirty-first year he was strongly attracted to
          Neoplatonism by the logic of his development. The idealistic
          character of this philosophy awoke unbounded enthusiasm, and he
          was attracted to it also by its exposition of pure intellectual
          being and of the origin of evil. These doctrines brought him
          closer to the Church,. though he did not yet grasp the full
          significance of its central doctrine of the personality of Jesus
          Christ. In his earlier writings he names this acquaintance with
          the Neoplatonic teaching and its relation to Christianity as the
          turning-point of his life, though in the Confessiones it appears
          only as a stage on the long road of error. The truth, as it may
          be established by a careful comparison of his earlier and later
          writings, is that his idealism had been distinctly strengthened
          by Neoplatonism, which had at the same time revealed his own
          will, and not a natura altera in him, as the subject of his
          baser desires. This made the conflict between ideal and actual
          in his life more unbearable than ever. Yet his sensual desires
          were still so strong that it seemed impossible for him to break
          away from them.

    9. Conversion to Christianity.

          Help came in a curious way. A countryman of his, Pontitianus,
          visited him and told him things which he had never heard about
          the monastic life and the wonderful conquests over self which
          had been won under its inspiration. Augustine's pride was
          touched; that the unlearned should take the kingdom of heaven by
          violence, while he with all his learning, was still held captive
          by the flesh, seemed unworthy of him. When Pontitianus had gone,
          with a few vehement words to Alypius, he went hastily with him
          into the garden to fight out this new problem. Then followed the
          scene so often described. Overcome by his conflicting emotions
          he left Alypius and threw himself down under a fig-tree in
          tears. From a neighboring house came a child's voice repeating
          again and again the simple words Tolle, lege, " Take up and
          read." It seemed to him a heavenly indication; he picked up the
          copy of St. Paul's epistles which he had left where he and
          Alypius had been sitting, and opened at Romans xiii. When he
          came to the words, " Let us walk honestly as in the day; not in
          rioting and drunkenness, not in chambering and wantonness," it
          seemed to him that a decisive message had been sent to his own
          soul, and his resolve was taken. Alypius found a word for
          himself a few lines further, " Him that is weak in the faith
          receive ye;" and together they went into the house to bring the
          good news to Monnica. This was at the end of the summer of 386.

    10. Baptism. Ordination in Africa.

          Augustine, intent on breaking wholly with his old life, gave up
          his position, and wrote to Ambrose to ask for baptism. The
          months which intervened between that summer and the Easter of
          the following year, at which, according to the early custom, he
          intended to receive the sacrament, were spent in delightful calm
          at a country-house, put at his disposal by one of his friends,
          at Cassisiacum (Casciago, 47 m. n. by w. of Milan). Here
          Monnica, Alypius, Adeodatus, and some of his pupils kept him
          company, and he still lectured on Vergil to them and held
          philosophic discussions. The whole party returned to Milan
          before Easter (387), and Augustine, with Alypius and Adeodatus,
          was baptized. Plans were then made for returning to Africa; but
          these were upset by the death of Monnica, which took place at
          Ostia as they were preparing to cross the sea, and has been
          described by her devoted son in one of the most tender and
          beautiful passages of the Confessiones. Augustine remained at
          least another year in Italy, apparently in Rome, living the same
          quiet life which he had led at Cassisiacum, studying and
          writing, in company with his countryman Evodius, later bishop of
          Uzalis. Here, where he had been most closely associated with the
          Manicheans, his literary warfare with them naturally began; and
          he was also writing on free will, though this book was only
          finished at Hippo in 391. In the autumn of 388, passing through
          Carthage, he returned to Thagaste, a far different man from the
          Augustine who had left it five years before. Alypius was still
          with him, and also Adeodatus, who died young, we do not know
          when or where. Here Augustine and his friends again took up a
          quiet, though not yet in any sense a monastic, life in common,
          and pursued their favorite studies. About the beginning of 391,
          having found a friend in Hippo to help in the foundation of what
          he calls a monastery, he sold his inheritance, and was ordained
          presbyter in response to a general demand, though not without
          misgivings on his own part.

    11. Presbyterate at Hippo.

          The years which he spent in the presbyterate (391-395) are the
          last of his formative period. The very earliest works which fall
          within the time of his episcopate show us the fully developed
          theologian of whose special teaching we think when we speak of
          Augustinianism. There is little externally noteworthy in these
          four years. He took up active work not later than the Easter of
          391, when we find him preaching to the candidates for baptism.
          The plans for a monastic community which had brought him to
          Hippo were now realized. In a garden given for the purpose by
          the bishop, Valerius, he founded his monastery, which seems to
          have been the first in Africa, and is of especial significance
          because it maintained a clerical school and thus made a
          connecting link between monasticism and the secular clergy.
          Other details of this period are that he appealed to Aurelius,
          bishop of Carthage, to suppress the custom of holding banquets
          and entertainments in the churches, and by 395 had succeeded,
          through his courageous eloquence, in abolishing it in Hippo;
          that in 392 a public disputation took place between him and a
          Manichean presbyter of Hippo, Fortunatus; that his treatise De
          fide et symbolo was prepared to be read before the council held
          at Hippo October 8, 393; and that after that he was in Carthage
          for a while, perhaps in connection with the synod held there in
          394.

    12. Beginnings of Polemic Activity.

          The intellectual interests of these four years are more easily
          determined, principally concerned as they are with the Manichean
          controversy, and producing the treatises De utilitate credendi
          (391), De duabus animabus contra Manichæos (first half of 392),
          and Contra Adimantum (394 or 395). His activity against the
          Donatists also begins in this period, but he is still more
          occupied with the Manicheans, both from the recollections of his
          own past, and from his increasing knowledge of Scripture, which
          appears, together with a stronger hold on the Church's teaching,
          in the works just named, and even more in others of this period,
          such as his expositions of the Sermon on the Mount and of the
          Epistles to the Romans and the Galatians. Full as the writings
          of this epoch are, however, of Biblical phrases and
          terms,--grace and the law, predestination, vocation,
          justification, regeneration--a reader who is thoroughly
          acquainted with Neoplatonism will detect Augustine's old love of
          it in a Christian dress in not a few places. He has entered so
          far into St. Paul's teaching that humanity as a whole appears to
          him a massa peccati or peccatorum, which, if left to itself,
          that is, without the grace of God, must inevitably perish.
          However much we are here reminded of the later Augustine, it is
          clear that he still held the belief that the free will of man
          could decide his own destiny. He knew some who saw in Romans ix
          an unconditional predestination which took away the freedom of
          the will; but he was still convinced that this was not the
          Church's teaching. His opinion on this point did not change till
          after he was a bishop.

    2. Work as Bishop.

    1. Election to the Bishopric.

          The more widely known Augustine became, the more Valerius, the
          bishop of Hippo, was afraid of losing him on the first vacancy
          of some neighboring see, and desired to fix him permanently in
          Hippo by making him coadjutor-bishop,--a desire in which the
          people ardently concurred. Augustine was strongly opposed to the
          project, though possibly neither he nor Valerius knew that it
          might be held to be a violation of the eighth canon of Nicaea,
          which forbade in its last clause " two bishops in one city"
          (Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, i, 407 sqq., Eng. transl., i,
          409-410); and the primate of Numidia, Megalius of Calama, seems
          to have raised difficulties which sprang at least partly from a
          personal lack of confidence. But Valerius carried his plan
          through, and not long before Christmas, 395, Augustine was
          consecrated by Megalius. It is not known when Valerius died; but
          it makes little difference, since for the rest of his life he
          left the administration more and more in the hands of his
          assistant.

    2. Possidius's View of Augustine's Services.

          A complete narration of Augustine's doings during the
          thirty-five years in which he was the glory of the little
          diocese would require a history of the African, almost of the
          whole Western, Church. Here we can do no more than briefly
          discuss some things which constitute his importance to later
          Christianity, and mention a few important biographical facts.
          Further details will be found in the articles [752]Donatism,
          [753]Pelagius, [754]Semipelagianism, [755]Monasticism,
          [756]North African Church. The life of Augustine by his friend
          Possidius shows that its author was possessed by the desire to
          erect a suitable memorial to a man who was destined to have a
          lasting importance in the history of the Church; it is much more
          than a mere product of hagiography. He considers Augustine first
          as an author who has left so many works in refutation of heresy
          and encouragement of piety that few even of diligent students
          can master them all; and he feels himself therefore bound to
          include a brief account of his subject's literary activity. Then
          he deals with the services which Augustine rendered to the peace
          and unity of the Church by his labors against the Donatists; and
          finally he attributes to Augustine's encouragement of
          monasticism much of its growth, together with an actual
          regeneration of the clerical life. His view on the two latter
          points, if colored a little by the local point of view, is still
          the respectable opinion of a contemporary; but it does not
          altogether agree with the deliberate historical judgment of
          posterity. The Vandal invasion, which came like a spring frost
          upon the young life of the African Church, and the Mohammedan
          conquests, both prevented Augustine's labors from having their
          full effect in Africa. Leaving aside for the moment the
          influence of his writings, one may really say that the
          condemnation of Pelagianism was the only permanant result of his
          work.

    3. Doctrinal Importance of Augustine.

          But his writings have continued to exert such an influence, by
          no means confined to the time of the early Church nor to African
          soil, as no other Father before or since has ever attained. If
          we look to the posthumous effects they have had, we may agree
          with the verdict of Possidius, and carry it further than was
          possible to a contemporary. Augustine is practically the father
          of all western Christianity after his time. It is true that
          Catholicism has never officially accepted his doctrine of grace
          in its entirety; but this fact is of relatively slight
          importance when we think of the colossal influence which his
          writings have had upon the gradual shaping of the Church's
          doctrine as a whole--there is scarcely a single Roman Catholic
          dogma which is historically intelligible without reference to
          his teaching. And it is not only the dogmas of the Western
          Church over which he has exerted an unparalleled influence; its
          hierarchical and its scientific development both derive from
          him. The great struggle between the rival chiefs of medieval
          Christendom, the pope and the emperor, is explicable in its
          deepest meaning, intelligible in its course, only from his De
          civitate Dei; when medieval theology was most active, then it
          was most under his influence, and the scholastic movement was
          determined, not only in its speculations but in its very method,
          by him. From him, again, medieval mysticism, in both its
          authorized and its heretical forms, received its most decisive
          impulse; Augustinian influences must be taken into account in
          the study of all the so-called precursors of the Reformation.
          When, however, we have called him the father of medieval
          Catholicism, we have not yet said all. The effect of his
          teaching in the East has been, to be sure, slight and indirect;
          but the Reformers made an ally of him. The characteristic notes
          of what are specifically called the Reformed Churches, in
          contradistinction to the Lutheran, are especially founded upon
          Augustinian tradition. In the history of philosophy, too, he has
          been a force far beyond the Middle Ages; in both Descartes and
          Spinoza his voice may be distinctly heard.

    4. Events of His Episcopate.

          Space forbids any attempt to trace all the causes of these
          abiding effects; and in what remains to be said, biographical
          interest must be largely our guide. We know a considerable
          number of events in Augustine's episcopal life which can be
          surely placed -- the so-called third and eighth synods of
          Carthage in 397 and 403, at which, as at those still to be
          mentioned, he was certainly present; the disputation with the
          Manichean Felix at Hippo in 404; the eleventh synod of Carthage
          in 407; the conference with the Donatists in Carthage, 411; the
          synod of Mileve, 416; the African general council at Carthage,
          418; the journey to Cæsarea in Mauretania and the disputation
          with the Donatist bishop there, 418; another general council in
          Carthage, 419; and finally the consecration of Eraclius as his
          assistant in 426. None of these events, however, marks a
          decisive epoch in his life, which flowed on quietly and evenly
          during the whole time of his episcopate, except the last few
          months. Thus it will require careful study to determine the
          epochs in his intellectual development during this period.

  II. Theology.

    1. His Anti-Manicheanism.

          His special and direct opposition to Manicheanism did not last a
          great while after his consecration. About 397 he wrote a
          tractate Contra epistolam [Manichæi] quam vocant fundamenti; in
          the De agone christiano, written about the same time, and in the
          Confessiones, a little later, numerous anti-Manichean
          expressions occur. After this, however, he only attacked the
          Manicheans on some special occasion, as when, about 400, on the
          request of his " brethren," he wrote a detailed rejoinder to
          Faustus, a Manichean bishop, or made the treatise De natura boni
          out of his discussions with Felix; a little later, also, the
          letter of the Manichean Secundinus gave him occasion to write
          Contra Secundinum, which, in spite of its comparative brevity,
          he regarded as the best of his writings on this subject. In the
          succeeding period, he was much more occupied with anti-Donatist
          polemics, which in their turn were forced to take second place
          by the emergence of the Pelagian controversy.

    2. His Anti-Pelagianism.

          It has been thought that Augustine's anti-Pelagian teaching grew
          out of his conception of the Church and its sacraments as a
          means of salvation; and attention was called to the fact that
          before the Pelagian controversy this aspect of the Church had,
          through the struggle with the Donatists, assumed special
          importance in his mind. But this conception should be denied. It
          is quite true that in 395 Augustine's views on sin and grace,
          freedom and predestination, were not what they afterward came to
          be. But the new trend was given to them before the time of his
          anti-Donatist activity, and so before he could have heard
          anything of Pelagius. What we call Augustinianism was not a
          reaction against Pelagianism; it would be much truer to say that
          the latter was a reaction against Augustine's views. He himself
          names the beginning of his episcopate as the turning-point.
          Accordingly, in the first thing which he wrote after his
          consecration, the De diversis quæstionibus ad Simplicianum (396
          or 397), we come already upon the new conception. In no other of
          his writings do we see as plainly the gradual attainment of
          conviction on any point; as he himself says in the Retractiones,
          he was laboring for the free choice of the will of man, but the
          grace of God won the day. So completely was it won, that we
          might set forth the specifically Augustinian teaching on grace,
          as against the Pelagians and the Massilians, by a series of
          quotations taken wholly from this treatise. It is true that much
          of his later teaching is still undeveloped here; the question of
          Predestination (though the word is used) does not really come
          up; he is not clear as to the term " election" ; and nothing is
          said of the " gift of perseverance." But what we get on these
          points later is nothing but the logical consequence of that
          which is expressed here, and so we have the actual genesis of
          Augustine's predestinarian teaching under our eyes. It is
          determined by no reference to the question of infant
          baptism--still less by any considerations connected with the
          conception of the Church. The impulse comes directly from
          Scripture, with the help, it is true, of those exegetical
          thoughts which he mentioned earlier as those of others and not
          his own. To be sure, Paul alone can not explain this doctrine of
          grace; this is evident from the fact that the very definition of
          grace is non-Pauline. Grace is for Augustine, both now and
          later, not the misericordia peccata condonans of the Reformers,
          as justification is not the alteration of the relation to God
          accomplished by means of the accipere remissionem. Grace is
          rather the misericordia which displays itself in the divine
          inspiratio, and justification is justum or pium fieri as a
          result of this. We may even say that this grace is an interna
          illuminatio such as a study of Augustine's Neoplatonism enables
          us easily to understand, which restores the connection with the
          divine bonum esse. He had long been convinced that " not only
          the greatest but also the smallest good things can not be,
          except from him from whom are all good things, that is, from
          God;" and it might well seem to him to follow from this that
          faith, which is certainly a good thing, could proceed from the
          operation of God alone. This explains the idea that grace works
          like a law of nature, drawing the human will to God with a
          divine omnipotence. Of course this Neoplatonic coloring must not
          be exaggerated; it is more consistent with itself in his earlier
          writings than in the later, and he would never have arrived at
          his predestinarian teaching without the New Testament. With this
          knowledge, we are in a position to estimate the force of a
          difficulty which now confronted Augustine for the first time,
          but never afterward left him, and which has been present in the
          Roman Catholic teaching even down to the Councils of Trent and
          the Vatican. If faith depends upon an action of our own,
          solicited but not caused by vocation, it can only save a man
          when, per fidem gratiam accipiens, he becomes one who not merely
          believes in God but loves him also. But if faith has been
          already inspired by grace, and if, while the Scripture speaks of
          justification by faith, it is held (in accordance with the
          definition of grace) that justification follows upon the infusio
          caritatis,--then either the conception of the faith which is
          God-inspired must pass its fluctuating boundaries and approach
          nearer to that of caritas, or the conception of faith which is
          unconnected with caritas will render the fact of its inspiration
          unintelligible and justification by faith impossible.
          Augustine's anti-Pelagian writings set forth this doctrine of
          grace more clearly in some points, such as the terms "
          election," " predestination," " the gift of perseverance," and
          also more logically; but space forbids us to show this here, as
          the part taken in this controversy by Augustine is so fully
          detailed elsewhere (see [757]Pelagius; [758]Semipelagianism). An
          enumeration of his contributions to this subject must suffice.

    3. Anti-Pelagian Writings.

          They are as follows: De peccatorum meritis et remissione (412);
          De spiritu et litera (412); De natura et gratia contra Pelagium
          (415); De perfectione justitiæ hominis (about 415); De gestis
          Pelagii (417); De gratia Christi et de peccato originali (418);
          De nuptiis et concupiscentia (419 and 420); De anima et ejus
          origine (about 419), which does not bear directly on
          Pelagianism, but answers a Pelagianizing critic of Augustine's
          reserve on the question of traducianism and creationism; Contra
          duas epistulas Pelagianorum ad Bonifatium, romanæ ecclesiæ
          episcopum (about 420); Contra Julianum (about 421); De gratia et
          libero arbitrio (426 or 427); De correptione et gratia (426 or
          427); De prædestinatione sanctorum (428 or 429); De dono
          perseverantiæ (428 or 429); and the opus imperfectum written in
          the last years of his life, Contra secundam Juliani
          responsionem.

    4. Activity Against Donatism.

          In order to arrive at a decision as to what influence the
          Donatist controversy had upon Augustine's intellectual
          development, it is necessary to see how long and how intensely
          he was concerned with it. We have seen that even before he was a
          bishop he was defending the catholic Church against the
          Donatists; and after his consecration he took part directly or
          indirectly in all the important discussions of the matter, some
          of which have been already mentioned, and defended the cause of
          the Church in letters and sermons as well as in his more formal
          polemical writings. The first of these which belongs to the
          period of his episcopate, Contra partem Donati, has been lost;
          about 400 he wrote the two cognate treatises Contra epistulam
          Parmeniani (the Donatist bishop of Carthage) and De baptismo
          contra Donatistas. He was considered by the schismatics as their
          chief antagonist, and was obliged to defend himself against a
          libelous attack on their part in a rejoinder now lost. From the
          years 401 and 402 we have the reply to the Donatist bishop of
          Cirta, Contra epistulam Petiliani, and also the Epistula ad
          catholicos de unitate ecclesiæ. The conflict was now reaching
          its most acute stage. After the Carthaginian synod of 403 had
          made preparations for a decisive debate with the Donatists, and
          the latter had declined to fall in with the plan, the bitterness
          on both sides increased. Another synod at Carthage the following
          year decided that the emperor should be asked for penal laws
          against the Donatists. Honorius granted the request; but the
          employment of force in matters of belief brought up a new point
          of discord between the two sides. When these laws were abrogated
          (409), the plan of a joint conference was tried once more in
          June, 411, under imperial authority, nearly 300 bishops being
          present from each side, with Augustine and Aurelius of Carthage
          as the chief representatives of the catholic cause. In the
          following year, the Donatists proving insubordinate, Honorius
          issued a new and severer edict against them, which proved the
          beginning of the end for the schism. For these years from 405 to
          412 we have twenty-one extant letters of Augustine's bearing on
          the controversy, and there were eight formal treatises, but four
          of these are lost. Those which we still have are: Contra
          Cresconium grammaticum (about 406); De unico baptismo (about 410
          or 411), in answer to a work of the same name by Petilian; the
          brief report of the conference (end of 411); and the Liber
          contra Donatistas post collationem (probably 412). After this
          date, though he occasionally touched on the question in letters
          and sermons, he produced practically no more literary polemics
          in regard to it; we know of one lost anti-Donatist treatise of
          about 416, and still possess one written for a special occasion
          Contra Gaudentium, Donatistarum episcopum, about 420; but these
          are all.

    5. Development of His Views.

          The earliest of the extant works against the Donatists present
          the same views of the Church and its sacraments which Augustine
          developed later. The principles which he represented in this
          conflict are merely those which, in a simpler form, had either
          appeared in the anti-Donatist polemics before his time or had
          been part of his own earlier belief. What he did was to
          formulate them with more dogmatic precision, and to permeate the
          ordinary controversial theses with his own deep thoughts on
          unitas, caritas, and inspiratio gratiæ in the Church, thoughts
          which again trace their origin back to his Neoplatonic
          foundations. In the course of the conflict he changed his
          opinion about the methods to be employed; he had at first been
          opposed to the employment of force, but later came to the "
          Compel them to come in" point of view. It may well be doubted,
          however, if the practical struggle with the schismatics had as
          much to do with Augustine's development as has been supposed.
          Far more weight must be attached to the fact that Augustine had
          become a presbyter and a bishop of the catholic Church, and as
          such worked continually deeper into the ecclesiastical habit of
          thought. This was not hard for the son of Monnica and the
          reverent admirer of Ambrose. His position as a bishop may fairly
          be said to be the only determining factor in his later views
          besides his Neoplatonist foundation, his earnest study of the
          Scripture, and the predestinarian conception of grace which he
          got from this. Everything else is merely secondary. Thus we find
          Augustine practically complete by the beginning of his
          episcopate--about the time when he wrote the Confessiones. It
          would be too much to say that his development stood still after
          that; the Biblical and ecclesiastical coloring of his thoughts
          becomes more and more visible and even vivid; but such
          development as this is no more significant than the effect of
          the years seen upon a strong face; in fact, it is even less
          observable here--for while the characteristic features of his
          spiritual mind stand out more sharply as time goes on with
          Augustine, his mental force shows scarcely a sign of age at
          seventy. His health was uncertain after 386, and his body aged
          before the time; on Sept. 26, 426, he solemnly designated
          Eraclius (or Heraclius) as his successor, though without
          consecrating him bishop, and transferred to him such a portion
          of his duties as was possible. But his intellectual vigor
          remained unabated to the end. We see him, as Prosper depicts him
          in his chronicle, " answering the books of Julian in the very
          end of his days, while the on-rushing Vandals were at the gates,
          and gloriously persevering in the defense of Christian grace."
          In the third month of the siege of Hippo by the barbarian
          invaders, he fell ill of a fever, and, after lingering more than
          ten days, died Aug. 28, 430. He was able to read on his
          sick-bed; he had the Penitential Psalms placed upon the wall of
          his room where he could see them. Meditating upon them, he
          fulfilled what he had often said before, that even Christians
          revered for the sanctity of their lives, even presbyters, ought
          not to leave the world without fitting thoughts of penitence.

    6. Additional Writings.

          He left no property behind him but the books which he had
          procured for the library of the church, among which, according
          to Possidius, corrected copies of his own works were some of the
          most valuable. They constitute, in fact, Augustine's legacy to
          the Church at large. Certain parts of it which have not been
          enumerated above may be mentioned here. He himself divided his
          writings into three classes: the 232 treatises (libri) discussed
          in the Retractiones; the letters; and the " popular tractates,
          which the Greeks call homilies" (he calls them sermones ad
          populum in another place). He had intended to review the two
          latter classes as he did with the libri in the Retractiones, but
          death prevented him. In so far, therefore, as the index of
          Possidius fails us--and this is often the case, owing to the
          uncertainty of titles and the great number of letters and
          sermons--a critical study of these classes of writings is much
          more difficult to make than of the libri. The edition published
          by the Benedictines of St. Maur (Paris, 1679-1700) in eleven
          folio volumes affords a useful working basis; it includes 217
          1etters, though the classification is not always justified, and
          a few more have come to light since. The sermons comprise a much
          larger number. Augustine must be considered, although his
          preaching did not please himself, as the greatest Western
          preacher of the early Church. He did not memorize his sermons,
          but after saturating himself with his subject, spoke from the
          inspiration of the moment; some of them he himself dictated for
          preservation after preaching them, while others were taken down
          by his hearers. Among those for which he is responsible are the
          series on the Gospel of John, dogmatically among his most
          interesting works (about 416), and the comments on the Psalms,
          partly preached (between 410 and 420).

    7. Miscellaneous Works.

          Of works not yet mentioned, those written after 395 and named in
          the Retractiones, may be classified under three
          heads--exegetical works; minor dogmatic, polemical, and
          practical treatises; and a separate class containing four more
          extensive works of special importance. The earliest of the minor
          treatises is De catechizandis rudibus (about 400), interesting
          for its connection with the history of catechetical instruction
          and for many other reasons. A brief enumeration of the others
          will suffice; they are: De opera monachorum (about 400); De bono
          conjugali and De sancta virginitate (about 401), both directed
          against Jovinian's depreciation of virginity; De divinatione
          dæmonum (between 406 and 411); De fide et operibus (413), a
          completion of the argument in the De spiritu et litera, useful
          for a study of the difference between the Augustinian and the
          Lutheran doctrines of grace; De cura pro mortuis, interesting as
          showing his attitude toward superstition within the Church; and
          a few others of less interest. We come now to the four works
          which have deserved placing in a special category. One is the De
          doctrina christiana (begun about 397, finished 426), important
          as giving his theory of scriptural interpretation and
          homiletics; another is the Enchiridion de fide, spe, et caritate
          (about 421), noteworthy as an attempt at a systematic
          collocation of his thoughts. There remain the two doctrinal
          masterpieces, the De trinitate (probably begun about 400 and
          finished about 416) and the De civitate Dei (begun about 413,
          finished about 426). The last-named, beginning with an
          apologetic purpose, takes on later the form of a history of the
          City of God from its beginnings, before the world was, to the
          time when it looks upward, beyond the world, to its heavenly
          goal. The closing years of his life, after the completion of the
          Retractationes in 426-427, were busy ones. Besides works already
          named, he wrote four others in these years: three against
          heresies, and the Speculum de scriptura sacra, a collection of
          the ethical teaching of the Scripture for popular use. We can
          not now tell whether the last paragraph of the Opus imperfectum
          or the latest of the letters were the last words he wrote; but
          the close of the letter is eminently characteristic of him:
          "That we may have a quiet and tranquil life in all piety and
          love, let this be your prayer for us (as it is ours for you),
          wherever you are; for, wherever we are, there is no place where
          he is not whose we are."

          Bibliography: The earliest printed ed. of the collected works
          was by Amerbach, 9 vols., Basel, 1506, reprinted Paris, 1515,
          lacking, however, the Epistolæ, Sermones, and Enarrationes in

          For the life of Augustine the chief sources are his
          Confessiones, Retractationes, and Epistolæ, and the Vita
          Augustini by his pupil Possidius, the latter ed. A. G. Cramer,
          Kiel, 1832, from which are culled the accounts in L. S.
          Tillemont, Mémoires . . . ecclésiastiques, vol. xi, Paris 1706
          (Eng. transl., 2 vols., London, 1733-35), and in ASB, Aug. vi,
          pp. xxviii, 213-286. Modern accounts to be mentioned are: F. A.

   Augustinians
          AUGUSTINIANS: The general name for a number of orders and
          congregations of both men and women living according to the
          so-called Augustinian rule. It is true that St. Augustine
          composed no monastic rule, for the hortatory letter to the nuns
          at Hippo Regius (Epist., ccxi, Benedictine ed.) can not properly
          be considered such; nevertheless three sets have been attributed
          to him (texts in Holstenius-Brockie, Codex regularum
          monasticarum, ii, Augsburg, 1759, 121-127), the longest of
          which, a medieval compilation from certain pseudo-Augustinian
          sermons in 45 chapters, is the one commonly known as the regula
          Augustini, and served as the constitution of the Regular Canons
          of St. Augustine and many societies imitating them, as, for
          example, the Dominicans (see [759]Chapter; [760]Dominic, Saint,
          and the Dominican Order).

          The Hermits of St. Augustine (who are generally meant by the
          name "Augustinians;" known also as "Austin Friars;" the order to
          which Martin Luther belonged) were the last of the four great
          mendicant orders which originated in the thirteenth century.
          They owed their existence to no great personality as founder,
          but to the policy of Popes Innocent IV (1241-54) and Alexander
          IV (1254-61), who wished to antagonize the too powerful
          Franciscans and Dominicans by means of a similar order under
          direct papal authority and devoted to papal interests. Innocent
          IV by a bull issued Dec. 16, 1243, united certain small hermit
          societies with Augustinian rule, especially the
          [761]Williamites, the [762]John-Bonites, and the [763]Brictinans
          (qq.v.). Alexander IV (admonished, it was said, by an appearance
          of St. Augustine) called a general assembly of the members of
          the new order under the presidency of Cardinal Richard of St.
          Angeli at the monastery of Santa Maria del Popolo in Rome in
          Mar., 1256, when the head of the John-Bonites, Lanfranc Septala,
          of Milan, was chosen general prior of the united orders.
          Alexander's bull Licet ecclesiæ catholicæ of Apr. 13, 1256,
          confirmed this choice. The same pope afterward allowed the
          Williamites, who were dissatisfied with the new arrangement, to
          withdraw, and they adopted the Benedictine rule. The new order
          was thus finally constituted. Several general chapters in the
          thirteenth century (1287 and 1290) and toward the end of the
          sixteenth (1575 and 1580), after the severe crisis occasioned by
          Luther's reformation, developed the statutes to their present
          form (text in Holstenius-Brockie, ut sup., iv, 227-357; cf.
          Kolde, 17-38), which was confirmed by Gregory XIII. A bull of
          Pius V in 1567 had already assigned to the Hermits of St.
          Augustine the place next to the last (between Carmelites and
          Servites) among the five chief mendicant orders. In its most
          flourishing state the order had forty-two provinces (besides the
          two vicariates of India and Moravia) with 2,000 monasteries and
          about 30,000 members. The German branch, which until 1299 was
          counted as one province, was divided in that year into four
          provinces: a Rheno-Swabian, Bavarian, Cologne-Flemish, and
          Thuringo-Saxon. To the last belonged the most famous German
          Augustinian theologians before Luther: Andreas Proles (d. 1503),
          the founder of the Union or Congregation of the Observant
          Augustinian Hermits, organized after strict principles; Johann
          von Paltz, the famous Erfurt professor and pulpit-orator (d.
          1511); Johann Staupitz, Luther's monastic superior and
          Wittenberg colleague (d. 1524).

          Reforms were also introduced into the extra-German branches of
          the order, but a long time after Proles's reform and in
          connection with the Counter-reformation of the sixteenth and
          seventeenth centuries. The most important of these later
          observant congregations are the Spanish Augustinian tertiary
          nuns, founded in 1545 by Archbishop Thomas of Villanova at
          Valencia; the " reformed" Augustinian nuns who originated under
          the influence of St. Theresa after the end of the sixteenth
          century at Madrid, Alcoy, and in Portugal; and the barefooted
          Augustinians (Augustinian Recollects; in France Augustins
          déchaussés) founded about 1560 by Thomas a Jesu (d. 1582).

   Aurelian
          AURELIAN: Roman emperor 270-275. He was of humble origin but
          through his talents as a soldier rose to a high position under
          the emperors Valerian and Claudius and by the latter was
          nominated Cæsar at the wish of the army. Upon the death of
          Claudius (270), Aurelian succeeded to the principate at a time
          when the integrity of the empire was threatened by the
          barbarians and the appearance of numerous pretenders within its
          bounds. His talent and energy in restoring order and repelling
          invasion won him the title of Restorer of the Commonwealth. He
          was victorious on the Danube and in Italy, but is best known in
          connection with the overthrow of the Syrian kingdom of Palmyra
          and its celebrated queen Zenobia. He was assassinated in Thrace
          by one of his own officers while preparing to set out on an
          expedition against the Persians.

          Aurelian, according to an old tradition in the Church,
          originated the ninth of the ten great persecutions of the
          Christians spoken of by the early writers; but this tradition
          seems to rest on a misunderstanding of the texts. Orosius (vii,
          23) speaks of Aurelian as a persecutor of the Christians, but
          attributes to him only the inception of a plan of persecution
          without stating that it was put into effect. The author of the
          De mortibus persecutorum (vi) is authority for the statement
          that an edict hostile to the Christians was promulgated, but
          that before it could reach the border provinces the death of the
          emperor intervened. Eusebius (Hist. eccl., vii, 30), to whom all
          other accounts may be referred as the source, says that toward
          the end of his reign Aurelian experienced a change of view with
          regard to the Christians and for the worse, but that before he
          could proceed to the execution of his hostile designs he was
          overtaken by the divine vengeance. Eusebius speaks neither of
          the actual issue of an edict nor of its execution, and this
          accords with the known character of the emperor and the
          conditions prevailing in the empire. Aurelian was first of all a
          soldier and was occupied almost entirely with military affairs
          during his reign. It is highly improbable that in a time of
          foreign danger and internal unrest he would risk further
          disturbances by organizing a general persecution of the
          Christians; and, though he was devoted to the pagan faith and
          even to its superstitions, he would recognize that Christianity
          had held, since the time of Gallienus, a publicly guaranteed
          position in the State.

   Auricular Confession
          AURICULAR CONFESSION (From Lat. auricula, " the external ear" ):
          Confession into the ear of a priest in private, enjoined by Leo
          the Great (440-461) as a substitute for public confession. The
          twenty-first canon of the Fourth Lateran Council (1215), under
          Innocent III, makes it obligatory every year upon all Catholics,
          on pain of excommunication, and consequently the loss of
          Christian burial. See [764]Confession of Sins.

   Aurifaber, (Goldschmid), Andreas
          AURIFABER, au-rî-fa´ber (GOLDSCHMID), ANDREAS: German physician
          and theologian, best known in connection with the Osiandrian
          controversy in Prussia; b. at Breslau 1514; d. at Königsberg
          Dec. 12, 1559. He began his studies at Wittenberg in 1527 and
          there gained the friendship of Melanchthon. In 1529 he became
          rector of the Latin school at Danzig and two years later
          accepted a similar post at Elbing. The bounty of Duke Albert of
          Prussia enabled him to pursue the study of medicine at
          Wittenberg and in Italy, and after 1545 he was physician to the
          Duke and professor of physics and medicine in the newly
          established university at Königsberg, issuing, in the
          performance of his duties, a number of treatises on physics and
          physiology. In 1550 he married a daughter of Osiander and thus
          became involved in the bitter controversy aroused by the
          latter's views on justification and grace (see [765]Osiander,
          Andreas). After Osiander's death in 1552, Aurifaber, who in the
          preceding year had been made rector of the university, became
          the leader of the Osiandrian party and made use of his office
          and his influence over the duke to crush the rival faction in
          Prussia, driving its adherents from the university in 1554. In
          pursuance of the same object he traveled extensively throughout
          Germany and by his activity aroused the bitter hatred of the
          conservatives, who assailed him with extreme virulence.
          Aurifaber, however, retained his influence till his death, which
          occurred suddenly, in the antechamber of the duke.

   Aurifaber, Johannes, of Breslau
          AURIFABER, JOHANNES, OF BRESLAU (Vratislaviensis): German
          reformer and church administrator, younger brother of Andreas
          Aurifaber; b. at Breslau Jan. 30, 1517; d. there Oct. 19, 1568.
          He began the study of languages and philosophy at Wittenberg in
          1534, and later turned to theology, forming an intimate
          friendship with Melanchthon, whose lifelong friend and adviser
          he remained. He became a member of the philosophical faculty in
          1540, and in 1545 was dean. In 1547 he became rector of a school
          at Breslau but returned in the following year to Wittenberg,
          leaving again in 1550 to assume the position of professor of
          theology at the University of Rostock, secured for him through
          Melanchthon's intercession. In 1551-52 he took a leading part in
          the drafting and promulgation of the Mecklenburg church order.
          Through the influence of his brother Andreas he was summoned to
          Königsberg in 1554 as professor of theology and inspector of the
          churches within the see of Samland, where it was hoped that his
          reputation for mildness and the conciliatory character of his
          theology would be instrumental in allaying the bitter
          dissensions aroused by the teachings of Osiander. Aurifaber
          devoted himself to the task of pacification and in September,
          1554, presided over a general synod called for the purpose of
          arriving at a compromise between the factions. The parochial
          clergy, however, regarded with mistrust the advent of an
          outsider who was not wholly free from suspicion of the
          Osiandrian taint and the synod failed to effect a compromise.
          Aurifaber was nevertheless appointed president of the see of
          Samland. Persisting in his efforts at conciliation he summoned a
          second synod at Riesenburg in 1556 and succeeded in obtaining
          from the Osiandrian faction a recantation of their extreme
          doctrines, without, however, satisfying either party. His
          unpopularity increased as a result of the publication, in 1558,
          of the new Prussian church order, with the preparation and
          editing of which Aurifaber was closely concerned and in which
          his opposition to the practise or exorcism in baptism found
          expression. Many of the clergy refused to subscribe to the new
          ordinances and recourse was had to imprisonment and expulsion,
          measures which were repugnant to Aurifaber and made his office
          irksome. In 1565 he resigned and returned to Breslau, where he
          became two years later pastor and inspector of schools and
          churches.

   Aurifaber, Johannes, of Weimar
          AURIFABER, JOHANNES, OF WEIMAR (Vinariensis): German Lutheran
          divine, best known as a collector and editor of the writings of
          Luther; b. probably in the county of Mansfeld in 1519; d. at
          Erfurt Nov. 18, 1575. He began his studies at the University of
          Wittenberg in 1537, where he attached himself closely to Luther.
          From 1540 to 1544 he acted as tutor to the young count of
          Mansfeld and in the following year made the campaign against the
          French as field chaplain. In 1545 he went to live with Luther as
          his famulus and remained with him till the great reformer's
          death in the following year. In 1550 he became court preacher at
          Weimar and for the next ten years took a very prominent part in
          the internal quarrels of the followers of Luther, distinguishing
          himself as a zealous adherent of the so-called Gnesio-Lutheran
          faction. His extreme views caused his dismissal from the court
          of Weimar in 1561 and he removed to Eisleben where he began his
          series of Luther publications. In 1566 he became pastor at
          Erfurt, where he passed the rest of his life engaged in almost
          incessant strife with his colleagues. Aurifaber began collecting
          Lutherana, as early as 1540 and by 1553 he claimed to be in
          possession of 2,000 letters of the master. From 1553 to 1556 he
          was coeditor on the Jena edition of the works of Luther. In the
          latter year he published a volume of Latin letters by Luther and
          followed this with a second volume in 1565. In 1566 appeared his
          celebrated Tischreden und Colloquia D. M. Luthers, of which part
          only, that dealing with the last days of the reformer, was based
          on notes taken by Aurifaber. The great mass of the work followed
          closely a collection of Luther's Table Talk prepared by
          Lauterbach as early as 1538 and subsequently revised by him.
          With Lauterbach's material Aurifaber incorporated much from
          other sources, displaying, however, little care in the collation
          of his texts or even in the logical arrangement of the sources.
          His compilation, therefore, has the value only of a secondary
          authority except for the memoranda of his own preservation.
          Without attempting deliberate falsification of his texts
          Aurifaber showed little hesitation in modifying the tone of
          Luther's discourse, so that his work should not be read without
          caution. It is more than probable that in many places he has
          sought to intensify Luther's characteristic homeliness of
          expression, with the result of lending to the book a spirit of
          gratuitous coarseness. Aurifaber derived great profit from the
          sale of collections of Luther's writings to the Protestant
          princes of Germany.

   Auso´nius, Decimus Magnus
          AUSO´NIUS, DECIMUS MAGNUS: Latin poet and rhetor; b. at
          Burdigalia (Bordeaux) about 310; d. there about 393. His family
          was of Celtic origin and the poet numbered among his near
          ancestors members of the Druid class. He received his education
          at Tolosa and, returning to his native city about 327,
          established himself as a teacher of grammar and rhetoric,
          attaining in a career of more than thirty years the reputation
          of one of the greatest professors of his time. About the year
          364 Ausonius probably declared himself formally a Christian, for
          in the following year he was summoned to Treves as tutor of the
          young Gratian, eldest son of the Emperor Valentinian I, a post
          which would have scarcely have been open to him if he had
          continued to profess the pagan faith. The sincerity of his
          conversion or rather the depth of his new belief has been made
          the subject of a long controversy, his writings offering
          evidence in support of different views. Thus his Versus
          paschales pro Augusto, falling between the years 367 and 371,
          express an undoubted adherence to the formulas of the Nicene
          Creed, while about the year 378 in the Precatio consulis
          designati he turns once more to the heathen gods, invoking Janus
          among them. Over Gratian, Ausonius exercised unbounded influence
          and when the former ascended the throne of the Western Empire in
          375 his tutor attained an important position in state affairs
          and was powerful enough to bestow the highest offices on members
          of his own family. He made use of his influence to further the
          cause of education in Gaul by instituting schools of rhetoric in
          the principal cities and he was active in saving the monuments
          of the ancient civilization from the iconoclastic fury of the
          early Christians. In 378 he was made prefect of Gaul and in the
          following year became consul. This was the climax of his career
          and was followed by the speedy disappearance of his influence
          over the emperor, who was now completely under the sway of the
          great Ambrose. Ausonius felt deeply the loss of power and it has
          been conjectured that his animosity against Ambrose finds
          expression in his Mixobarbaron, which some would have to be a
          travesty in form and matter upon the hymns of the bishop of
          Milan. Whether his views upon Christianity also underwent an
          unfavorable change with the decline of his fortunes is
          uncertain. A poem of the year 379 in which Ausonius commends
          himself to the aid of Christ as his master, would be decisive on
          this point were it not for the fact that in the first collection
          of his poems which he prepared in 383 the Christian element
          appears as unimportant, while verses quite in the nature of the
          old pagan hedonism find a very conspicuous place. After the
          death of Gratian, Ausonius gave himself up to literary work,
          leading a life of luxurious ease in his native city or on his
          estates in Aquitania. From this period date the family poems,
          Parentalia, and the biographic Commemoratio professorum
          Burdigalensium, which, though far inferior in literary value to
          his exquisite masterpiece, the Mosella, are of value as sources
          for the life and thought of his times. It is in this period,
          too, that Ausonius appears in his most interesting aspect as the
          representative of the classic spirit and culture battling in
          vain against the rising spirit of asceticism, which under the
          inspiration of men like Martin of Tours was rapidly transforming
          the character of West European civilization. Among the most
          devoted followers of St. Martin was Paulinus of Nola, a former
          pupil of Ausonius, and in the letters which passed between the
          two men this conflict between the old and new finds eloquent
          expression. Possibly the nearest approximation to the poet's
          real views on Christianity may be obtained by considering him
          solely in the character of a literary craftsman, to whom, by
          temperament, religion was a more remote influence than art, and
          who, while lending adherence to the formulas of the Christian
          faith, continued to find in the old beliefs inspiration and
          grateful material for the use of his poetic gifts.

    1. History.

          Australia is a continent and a federal commonwealth that
          includes, for administrative purposes, the island of Tasmania;
          it consists of five states, with a population of about 3,670,000
          in 1901, in addition to the 172,000 inhabitants of Tasmania. In
          1788 Sydney, in the present state of New South Wales, was
          founded, chiefly as a penal settlement, but the immigration of
          freemen continued side by side with that of criminals until
          1840, while after 1835 the latter class of settlers entered the
          colony in considerable numbers. In the present Western Australia
          and Queensland penal settlements were established at King George
          Sound and Brisbane in 1825 and 1826, while Adelaide and South
          Australia were settled in 1836. In consequence of the rich
          discoveries of gold Victoria was formed into a new colony in
          1851, and Queensland was separated from New South Wales eight
          years later. These districts enjoyed the utmost independence,
          especially after 1855, but the need of union was increasingly
          felt, so that on Jan. 1, 1901, a confederation of all the
          colonies and Tasmania was formed under the name of the
          Commonwealth of Australia. The administration consists of the
          Governor-General, seven ministers, a senate of six members from
          each of the allied states, and a house of seventy-six
          representatives. In addition to this, each state has its own
          parliament and president.

    2. Relation to England.

          The legal bond of Australia with the mother country is extremely
          loose, since the power of the English Governor-General is
          restricted to a temporary veto with regard to foreign affairs.
          On the other hand, by far the greater majority of the population
          recognize themselves as united with the mother country by
          descent, language, and religion, so that Australia and England
          are knit together by internal bonds other than political. The
          import and export trade, moreover, is carried on chiefly with
          England, which is also the principal creditor of the national
          debt of Australia. The immigrants naturally transplanted their
          ecclesiastical tendencies and institutions into their new home,
          and the religious communities of Australia are vitally connected
          with those of the mother country as well as with other British
          colonies, thus further cementing the internal union of Australia
          and England.

    3. Church and State. General Statistics.

          An external union of Church and State was long maintained in
          Australia, the state finances paying the greater part of the
          salaries of the clergy and contributing largely to the building
          of churches and parish expenses until the seventh decade of the
          nineteenth century. The dissolution of this relation, begun by
          New South Wales in 1862, brought little disadvantage to the
          larger denominations, and of the smaller sects only the
          Lutherans (chiefly Germans) suffered severely by the change.

          The following table gives results of the census of 1901, to
          which figures for 1891 are added for comparison:

   34,930

          To the figures for 1901 are to be added 1,240 Quakers, 3,100
          Unitarians, 22,050 who reported themselves simply as Protestants
          (the majority probably Germans), 11,660 " Christians," and
          24,200 adherents of smaller bodies. The Salvation Army numbered
          31,150. The sum total of the Protestant population of the
          Commonwealth is therefore in the neighborhood of two and three
          quarter millions.

          The Roman Catholics are also strong in Australia, as is shown by
          the following table:

     New South Wales Queensland South Australia Tasmania Victoria West
   Australia
   1901 . . . . . . . . . . . . . . 847,150 120,700 52,200 30,350 260,050

   12,500

          Adding 6,200 who designated themselves simply as " Catholics,"
          the sum total is 857,450.

    4. Anglican Church.

          The ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the religious bodies
          naturally conforms to the political boundaries of the states,
          although, as in case of the states, unions, either temporary or
          permanent, have been formed. The oldest and most prominent
          Protestant body in Australia is the Anglican Church, with a
          membership of 1,498,750. Services were held as early as 1788,
          although the bishopric of Australia (including Tasmania and New
          Zealand) was not created until 1836. In 1847 three new
          bishoprics were created and the former bishop of Australia
          became bishop of Sydney and metropolitan of Australia and
          Tasmania. In 1897 the incumbent was made archbishop of Sydney
          and he has the title of primate of Australia. He is elected by
          the Australian bishops, but must be confirmed by the archbishop
          of Canterbury. At present the province of New South Wales
          includes, besides the primatial see of Sydney, the dioceses of
          Bathurst (founded 1869), Goulburn (1863), Grafton and Armidale
          (1867), Newcastle (1847), and Riverina (1883). The province of
          Victoria comprises the dioceses of Ballarat (1875), Bendigo
          (1902), Gippsland (1902), Melbourne (1847), and Wangaratta
          (1902). The province of Queensland includes the dioceses of
          Brisbane (1859), North Queensland (1878), Rockhampton (1892),
          New Guinea (1896), and Carpentaria (1900). Further, there are
          the independent dioceses of Tasmania, with seat at Hobart
          (1842); Adelaide, for South Australia (1847); Perth (1857) and
          Bunbury (1903), in West Australia. Each bishopric manages its
          own affairs, diocesan conventions being convened from time to
          time by the bishop and attended by both clergy and laity. The
          chief business of these conventions concerns finance, the
          education of clergy, and relations to other ecclesiastical
          bodies. In 1872 a regular organization was adopted which unites
          the dioceses of the present Commonwealth under the primate of
          Sydney. Clerical and lay representatives of these sees assemble
          every five years at Sydney for general conference and
          legislation. In education the Anglican Church is important
          chiefly through a number of colleges under its supervision.

    5. Other Protestants.

          The Presbyterians, who numbered 427,000 in the Commonwealth in
          1901, belong to several branches. Their first minister was
          installed at Sydney in 1823. The synod of each state and the
          general assembly meet annually. The Australian Methodists in
          1901 were 506,000 strong. After the census of that year, which
          showed seven branches of Methodists in New South Wales, the
          union of the entire denomination was effected by the
          establishment of the " Methodist Church of Australia," first in
          three colonies, and in 1902 in the remainder. The first Wesleyan
          service in Australia was held in 1821, but a. Methodist
          conference was not established until 1854; it was at first
          affiliated with the British conference, becoming independent in
          1876. An annual conference is held in each colony, and the
          general conference meets triennially, while every ten years the
          Australian Methodists take part in the international Methodist
          Ecumenical Conference. The Baptists of Australia numbered 91,700
          in 1901, although they did not begin to increase rapidly until
          after 1852, their gains being due primarily to their missionary
          activity in cooperation with the larger denominations already
          mentioned. The Congregationalists, including the Independents,
          numbered 75,350 in 1901, but can scarcely be considered a united
          and influential religious community on account of their basal
          principle.

    6. Roman Catholics.

          The Roman Catholic Church in the commonwealth, with 857,450
          members, is divided into five provinces. Although Roman Catholic
          priests were in Australia as early as 1803, it was not until
          1820 that the Church came to a vigorous development with the aid
          of State subvention of clergy and buildings. In 1834 Sydney
          became the seat of a vicar apostolic with twenty-five priests,
          and eight years later was elevated into an archbishopric and the
          seat of a metropolitan for Australia and the islands, Hobart and
          Adelaide being suffragan sees, although they did not remain in
          the province of Sydney, which now includes Maitland (1847),
          Armidale (1862), Goulburn (1862), Bathurst (1865), Lismore
          (formerly Grafton; 1887), and Wilcannia (1887). The second
          oldest archbishopric is Melbourne, which was created a diocese
          in 1847 and elevated to an archdiocese in 1874. To it belong the
          bishoprics of Sandhurst (1874), Ballarat (1874), and Sale, the
          southeastern part of Victoria (1887). In 1887 Adelaide and
          Brisbane (founded as bishoprics in 1842 and 1859) were made
          archbishoprics. The province of the former comprises the
          dioceses of Perth (1845); Victoria, formerly Palmerston, in the
          north, opposite Melville Island (1847); Port Augusta, on Spencer
          Gulf (1887); and Geraldton (1898); also the abbacy of New Norcia
          (founded on Moore River in 1867) and the apostolic vicarship of
          Kimberley (1887). Brisbane includes the bishopric of Rockhampton
          (1881) and the apostolic vicarships of Cooktown (founded in 1876
          and placed for the most part in the charge of the Augustinians
          for missionary purposes) and Queensland (1887). The fifth
          province is Hobart (Tasmania), founded as a bishopric in 1842,
          raised to metropolitan rank in 1888. Many of these dioceses
          contain but few Roman Catholics, and were poor in ecclesiastical
          institutions and churches at the time of their creation. With
          the rapid increase of immigration after the seventh decade of
          the nineteenth century, however, and in the determination to
          resist the propaganda of Protestant denominations, orders and
          congregations were brought to Australia at an early period, and
          were particularly active in missions and parochial schools. The
          most extensive settlements were those of the Jesuits, the
          Marists, the Dominicans, and the Brothers of the Christian
          Schools, although the Benedictines were the first to arrive. The
          most active female orders are the Sisters of Charity, the
          Sisters of the Good Shepherd, and the Sisters of St. Joseph.
          Roman Catholic associations flourish in all the cities, and
          schools of all kinds, especially intermediate, are under
          ecclesiastical control, while Roman Catholic newspapers and
          weeklies promote the interests of this Church. Synods of the
          Roman Catholic clergy of Australia have thrice been held, the
          first being in 1844.

    7. Non-Christian Religions.

          The number of Jews in Australia is relatively small; there were
          in 1901 only 14,850, of whom 6,450 were in New South Wales and
          5,910 in Victoria. Mohammedans, chiefly from India and the Sunda
          Islands, numbered scarcely 4,500, chiefly in Queensland.
          Confucians and Buddhists were not carefully distinguished in
          every colony, as is clear from the grave discrepancy between the
          number of Chinese immigrants and the figures assigned to
          Confucianism and Buddhism. The majority of Buddhists live in New
          South Wales, while the most of the Confucians are found in
          Queensland and Victoria. The estimated number of the latter in
          the Commonwealth is between 15,000 and 16,000, and that of the
          former more than 7,000.

    8. Missions Among Aborigines.

          Polytheists and fetish-worshipers come from the islands of the
          Pacific, the Philippines, and the Sunda Islands; it is uncertain
          how large a proportion of this category is made up of the
          aborigines. By far the greater number of Australian blackfellows
          have been converted to Christianity by missionary activity in
          their behalf, although the precarious conditions of life and the
          poverty of nature in the interior render it extremely difficult
          to reach the natives in that region, and the obstacles are
          augmented by their spiritual and moral degradation.
          Nevertheless, not only the larger denominations, but also the
          smaller, such as the Lutherans and the Quakers, are engaged in
          missionary activity among the aborigines. There are, in
          addition, special societies under the auspices of the Anglican
          Church and unions of several denominations, such as the
          Aborigines' Protection Mission, the Society for the Propagation
          of the Gospel, the Free Mission (in New South Wales), and the
          Australian Board of Missions (in Victoria). The missions of the
          Roman Catholic Church are chiefly in the north. The number of
          unconverted Australian aborigines is estimated between 10,000
          and 20,000. Several missions have also been established for
          workmen in the gold mines. The number of those who profess to be
          without a religion, such as freethinkers and the like, is
          inconsiderable, the census returning less than 24,000 of this
          class; to this group, however, should doubtless be added many of
          those who declined to answer the question concerning their
          religion, so that the number can probably be doubled.

    9. Education.

          The public schools of Australia underwent an important change in
          the eighth decade of the nineteenth century, when obligatory
          gratuitous instruction was introduced into all the colonies.
          While many schools are still maintained by religious
          denominations, all citizens contribute to the support of the
          public schools. The intermediate schools, on the other hand,
          are, for the most part, under denominational control and of
          denominational origin. Popular Christian education is also
          furthered by the Sunday-schools, which are well attended.

          Austria is an empire of southern Europe, forming with the
          kingdom of Hungary (which is not included in the present
          article; see [776]Hungary) the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy.
          Excluding also the former Turkish provinces of Bosnia and
          [777]Herzegovina (q. v.), the area is 115,903 square miles, the
          population (1900) 26,107,304.

  I. The Roman Catholic, Greek, and Armenian Churches:

          During the period of the Reformation, Protestantism made much
          progress among the people and gave rise to a considerable number
          of sects, especially in Bohemia. But the government remained
          Roman Catholic and by force and law freed the Church from heresy
          and then began to rule it. Long before the reign of Joseph II
          (1780-90) Gallican and Jansenist teachings were introduced and
          were intensified by Febronianism (see [778]Hontheim, Johann
          Nikolaus), and Joseph transformed the Austrian Church into a
          body which was almost schismatic. An ecclesiastical government
          was formed which regulated the minutest details by state law,
          sparing scarcely any department of activity, legislation, or
          administration. (see [779]Joseph II).

    1. The Concordat of 1855.

          A new period began with the concordat of 1855 (see
          [780]Concordants and Delimiting Bulls, VI, 2, §§ 6, [781]8). The
          imperial patent of Mar. 4, 1849 and the imperial enactments of
          Apr. 18 and 23, 1850, laid the foundation of the complete
          independence of the Church and in 1853 negotiations were begun
          with the Curia for carrying out the new provisions. The result
          was the concordat of Aug. 18, 1855, which was promulgated by a
          bull of the pope and by an imperial patent, both dated Nov. 5 of
          the same year. A definite agreement in regard to all
          ecclesiastical matters was enacted in thirty-six articles. The
          jurisdiction and administration of the Church, so far as its
          internal interests were concerned, were placed entirely under
          church control, in this category falling the relations between
          the bishops, the clergy, the laity, and the Holy See; the
          education and ordination of the clergy; diocesan administration;
          the arrangement of public prayers, processions, pilgrimages,
          funerals, provincial councils, and diocesan synods; the
          superintendence and giving of instruction to the Roman Catholic
          youth, and all religious instruction from the theological
          faculties to the public schools; the ecclesiastical right to
          censor books; jurisdiction over marriage; the discipline of the
          clergy; the right of patronage; ecclesiastical penalties
          inflicted on the laity; seizing of ecclesiastical property; and
          the internal administration of religious orders. The State
          retained control of marriage in its civil aspect, the civic
          position of the clergy, and the right to punish them. An
          agreement between Church and State was necessary for the
          creation or alteration of dioceses, parishes, and other
          benefices, the collation to livings and ecclesiastical offices,
          the appointment of professors of theology, catechists, the
          inspectors of schools, the introduction of orders and religious
          congregations, and the expenditure of religious funds.

    2. Effects of the Concordat.

          The results of the concordat, though it was actually enforced in
          but few points, were especially noteworthy in two phases of
          public life. The marriage laws hitherto prevailing were
          subjected to a rigid scrutiny, and by the imperial patent of
          Oct. 8,1856, the Roman Catholics received a new law
          corresponding in all respects to the decrees of the Council of
          Trent, placing divorce under the control of the newly created
          episcopal divorce court. Seminaries for boys were established in
          all dioceses,. and received children of lawful birth immediately
          after they left the public schools, giving them, in addition to
          their gymnasium training, preparation for later theological
          studies, thus forming places of education for the future clergy.
          The expenses of these seminaries were partly covered by
          ecclesiastical funds and partly by the income from benefices.
          The influence of the State was limited to the supervision of
          their financial relations and the superintendence of instruction
          so far as it concerned the State. The result was an increase in
          the number of Roman Catholic theological students from 1,804 in
          1861 to 3,286 in 1868, after which began a period of decline,
          due especially to the law of Dec. 5, 1868, which abrogated the
          previous exemption of theological students from military
          service, an additional factor being the school laws of 1868 and
          1869, which made admission to study in a faculty conditional on
          the possession of a diploma from a gymnasium. The breach with
          the concordat widened steadily, and the law of May 25, 1868,
          repealed the imperial patent of Oct. 8, 1856. The former
          regulations concerning marriage were again enforced, divorces
          being referred to state tribunals and civil marriage being again
          permitted. Finally, by a despatch of July 30,1870, Austria
          abrogated the concordat altogether.

    3. Theological Education.

          The theological training of the Roman Catholic clergy is given
          partly by the faculties of the various universities and partly
          by the diocesan seminaries. Theological faculties exist in the
          universities of Vienna, Gras, Innsbruck, Prague (two), Lemberg
          (for both the Latin and Greek rites), Czernowitz, and Cracow, in
          addition to two independent theological faculties, not
          affiliated with any university, in Salzburg and Olmütz. The
          course given by the diocesan seminaries corresponds essentially
          to that given by the university faculties, but they are
          forbidden to confer academic degrees and the bishop is in
          absolute control. Certain orders provide for the education of
          their own members in twenty monastic schools, yearly courses
          being given in successive years in different monasteries in the
          Tyrol. In 1895 the Roman Catholic Church had 16,132 priests, the
          Greek Catholic 2,649, and the Greek Oriental 475.

    4. Revenues.

          In cases where a living has no canonical claims to a definite
          income, the revenues of the Church, and even the State, come to
          its assistance. The claim to such an income, either from the
          property of the living or from the benefice, begins with
          ordination to the priesthood, but if religious foundations and
          monasteries desire to give a title to such income to one who
          does not belong to their own number, they are required to secure
          the consent of the government. The endowment of the Church has
          come from the monasteries secularized in the reign of Joseph II
          and later, abandoned churches, and suppressed communities,
          canonries, benefices, and ecclesiastical feoffs. It is
          continually augmented, moreover, by the intercalaries (the
          income of vacant positions), the auxiliary taxes of dioceses and
          orders, and, in Bohemia, by a certain percent of the sale of
          salt. This fund, when the property has been sold, is invested in
          state bonds which belong to the ecclesiastical province or
          diocese, the income being administered by the government with
          the cooperation of the bishop or bishops. It is charged with the
          defrayal of certain expenses (the cathedral chapters of Budweis,
          Salzburg, Trent, and Brixen drawing their entire income from
          it), as well as with the payment of all other disbursements
          which are not obligatory on a third party. The revenues are
          devoted to the defrayment of patronage, the income and endowment
          of new parish, the building of churches, the increase in the
          income of livings, the salary of chaplains, the malting good of
          deficits, the support of mendicant orders, the salaries of
          teachers at the state schools, and the maintenance of
          theological faculties and seminaries. A second fund is that for
          students, which is derived from the estates of the Jesuit
          monasteries suppressed by Maria Theresa on Dec. 23, 1774, and is
          devoted to defraying the expenses of Roman Catholic education in
          intermediate and higher institutions of learning. Since the
          passage of the new school law, this fund is also used for
          undenominational public schools, since the estates of the Jesuit
          monasteries are not regarded as the property of the Church. For
          the value of the livings and the income of the religious orders
          no recent data are at hand, but in 1875 the former amounted in
          all parts of the empire to 7,644,611 florins, and the latter to
          4,100,375 florins.

    5. Archdioceses and Dioceses.

          Austria is divided into nine ecclesiastical provinces as
          follows: (1) the archdiocese of Vienna for Upper and Lower
          Austria, with the two suffragan dioceses of St. Pölten and Linz;
          (2) Salzburg for Salzburg, Styria, Carinthia, Tyrol, and
          Vorarlberg, with the five suffragan dioceses of Secksu, Lavant,
          Gurk, Brixen, and Trent; (3) Görz for Carniola, Küstenland, and
          the island of Arbe, with the four suffragan dioceses of Laibach,
          Triest-Capo d'Istria, Parenzo-Pola, and Veglia-Arbe; (4) Prague
          for Bohemia, with the three suffragan dioceses of Leitmeritz,
          Königgrätz, and Budweis; (5) Olmütz for Moravia and a portion of
          Silesia, with the suffragan diocese of Brünn; (6) the Austrian
          portion of the exempt diocese of Breslau for the remainder of
          Silesia; (7) the Austrian portion of the archdiocese of Warsaw,
          with the diocese of Cracow; (8) Lemberg for Galicia (excepting
          Cracow) and Bukowina, with the two suffragan dioceses of
          Przemysl and Tarnow; (9) Zara for Dalmatia (excepting Arbe),
          with the five suffragan dioceses of Sebenico, Spalato-Macarsca,
          Lesina, Ragusa, and Cattaro.

    6. Societies and Charities.

          Austria, like Germany, has countless Roman Catholic societies,
          institutions, and foundations. In almost every parish there are
          brotherhoods and societies far prayer, associations of both
          sexes and all ages, societies of priests, congregations of Mary,
          Franciscan Tertiaries, the Society of the Holy Family (with
          25,000 families in the diocese of Lavant alone), societies for
          pilgrimage and for the building and adornment of churches,
          church music, home missions, brotherhoods of St. Michael,
          political Roman Catholic societies, and general Roman Catholic
          social organizations with 40,000 members in the single province
          of Upper Austria. Children and youth are cared for in
          protectories, kindergartens, orphan asylums, refectories,
          boarding-schools, refuges, training-schools for apprentices, and
          the like, while the great Roman Catholic school-union has about
          40,000 members. Popular education is promoted by reading clubs
          and societies for the dissemination of educational literature,
          as well as by reading-rooms and libraries for the clergy and
          laity, while Roman Catholic science, literature, and art are
          advanced by the Leo-Gesellschaft, the Czech society Vlast, and
          by various periodicals. Countless institutions are devoted to
          charity, including almshouses, memorial foundations, poor gilds,
          hospitals of the most various characters, and funds for the
          feeding of the poor in monasteries. There are likewise insurance
          societies for the protection of masters, partners, apprentices,
          peasants, workmen, credit and other purposes of economic nature,
          but clubs of Roman Catholic students are still only in embryo.

    7. Greek and Armenian Christians.

          There is a large number of Greek and Armenian Christians, some
          being Uniates and some non-Uniates. The Uniate Greeks, or Greek
          Catholics, form a special ecclesiastical province with the
          archdiocese of Lemberg and the suffragan diocese of Przemysl.
          The Uniates of the Armeno-Catholic rite also have an
          archbishopric of Lemberg, the archbishop likewise ruling over
          the non-Uniate Armenians of Galicia and Bukowina. The non-Uniate
          Greeks of the Greek Oriental rite have a patriarchate at
          Carlowitz with ten bishoprics or eparchies, of which seven are
          in Hungary, one in Czernowitz (Bukowina), one at Hermannstadt
          (Transylvania), and one at Sebenico (for Dalmatia and Istria),
          in addition to the community at Vienna. The patriarch is chosen
          by the national congress of Servia, which must remain in session
          sufficiently long for its candidate to receive the sanction of
          the emperor, after which the formal consecration takes place.
          The non-Uniate Armenians of the Armeno-Oriental rite control the
          Mekhitarist monastery in Vienna (see [782]Mekhitarists) and are
          accordingly subject to the Uniate Armenian archbishop of
          Lemberg. The Old Catholics have three parishes at Vienna,
          Warnsdorf, and Ried, and in 1902 built two new churches at
          Schönlinde and Blottendorf. The Philippones, or Lippowanians,
          expelled from Russia, have formed scattered communities in
          Galicia and Bukowina.

  II. The Protestant Churches.

    1. The Evangelical Church and its Organization.

          Austria is essentially Roman Catholic, and the number of
          Evangelical Protestants in the Empire has declined from a tenth
          of the population at the time of their greatest expansion in the
          sixteenth century to a fiftieth. A patent of toleration was
          issued in their favor on Oct. 13, 1781, and the Protestant
          patent of Apr. 8, 1861, conferred upon them full equality before
          the law. At the same time the political, civil, and academic
          disabilities of the non-Catholics were removed, and they were no
          longer required to contribute to the support of another Church,
          while they were now permitted to adorn their churches, to
          celebrate their feasts, and to exercise pastoral care. On the
          day after the patent was issued (Apr. 9), a preliminary church
          constitution was drawn up, but one which was substituted on Jan.
          6 (23), 1866, canceled important rights of self-government, and
          from this the present constitution of Dec. 9, 1891, differs only
          in minor details. The Evangelical Church, divided into parishes,
          seniories, superintendencies, and synods, is unrestricted in
          respect to its confession, its books, the creation of societies
          for ecclesiastical and educational purposes, and its relations
          to foreign religious bodies. It forms a national Church, of
          which the emperor may be regarded as the bishop, his
          prerogatives in its control being distinguished from the
          corresponding functions of the Roman Catholic German sovereigns
          in degree, not in kind. His position is due, however, to his
          constitutional relation to the Evangelical Church, and not, as
          in the case of the German princes, to his ecclesiastical
          relation. The lawful administration of Evangelical funds, as
          well as revenues and assessments, is guaranteed by the State.

          The Austrian Evangelical Church is divided into ten
          superintendencies, six of the Augsburg Confession, three of the
          Helvetic Confession, and one mixed. Those of the Augsburg
          Confession are: (1) Vienna, with the seniories of Lower Austria,
          Triest, Styria, the region south of the Drave in Carinthia, and
          the region north of the Drave and in the Gmünd valley in
          Carinthia; (2) Upper Austria, with an upper and a lower seniory;
          (3) Western Bohemia; (4) Eastern Bohemia; (5) Asch (also in
          Bohemia); (6) Moravia and Silesia, with the seniories of Brünn,
          Zauchtl, and Silesia. The superintendencies of the Helvetic
          Confession are: (1) Vienna; (2) Bohemia, with the seniories of
          Prague, Chrudim, Podiebrad, and Czaslau; and

          (3) Moravia, with a western and an eastern seniory. The
          superintendency of mixed confession is that of Galicia and
          Bukowina, with three seniories of the Augsburg Confession,
          western, middle, and eastern, and one of the Helvetic
          Confession, Galicia. There is also a small Anglican parish in
          Triest, under the control of the Helvetic superintendency of
          Vienna. The number of ministers and vicars in 1900 was 299, and
          there were 640 places of worship.

    2. Changes of Confession.

          While in the last decade of the nineteenth century the increase
          of Roman Catholics was but 9.12 per cent, the Evangelicals of
          the Augsburg Confession showed an increase of 15.17 per cent, as
          against 9.28 in the preceding decade;. and the Helvetic
          Confession a gain of 6.67 per cent, as contrasted with the more
          rapid accretion of 9.05 in the ten years previous. In Bohemia
          the Evangelical gain was 20.06 per cent, in Styria 25.9 per
          cent, and in Lower Austria 37.01 per cent. In Silesia and
          Galicia alone the increase of Evangelicals failed to keep pace
          with. the gain in population, this being due to the increasing
          emigration from the German districts of West Silesia and the
          German colonies in Galicia, an additional factor being the
          immigration of Galician workmen to Silesia to work in the coal
          mines.

          No statistics are available for a classification of the Austrian
          Protestants according to language, nor are the figures
          sufficiently complete to afford a safe basis to determine the
          changes caused by immigration and emigration. The Los von Rom
          movement, which began in 1898, resulted by 1900 in the loss of
          more than 40,000 members to the Roman Catholic Church, some
          30,000 becoming Evangelicals, several thousand Old Catholics, an
          undetermined number joining the Moravians and Methodists, while
          some broke entirely with denominational Christianity. Many,
          however, returned to the Roman Catholic Church. A hundred new
          chapels were erected, and seventy-five preachers, chiefly from
          Germany, entered upon the work (see [783]Los von Rom).

    3. Schools.

          Religious instruction is given in the primary and secondary
          schools by the minister of the parish, or, in certain cases, by
          secular teachers of religion, either in the school or in "
          stations." By a law of June 17, 1888, an allowance was given or
          a special teacher of religion was appointed in the higher
          classes of primary or secondary schools of more than three
          classes, and more than 160 teachers of this description are
          active in over 560 " stations." The Church also provides for
          religious instruction in normal and intermediate schools,
          although state aid is given only when the total number of
          Evangelical scholars in such an institution is more than twenty.
          National, district, and local school boards are entrusted with
          the administration and supervision of normal and intermediate
          schools in each province, and in almost all the boards the
          Evangelical Church has a vote (at least advisory) and
          representatives. In consequence of the rivalry of the state
          undenominational schools, however, the Evangelical schools tend
          to become more or less ultramontane, and are gradually
          decreasing as a result of the double taxes levied on the
          Evangelicals. In 1869 there were 372 Evangelical schools, a
          number which has since decreased by two-thirds. An Evangelical
          normal school exists in Bielitz for the training of Evangelical
          teachers, while in Czaslau there is a Czech Evangelical Reformed
          seminary for Bohemia and Moravia.

    4. Theological Education.

          The education of the Evangelical clergy is confined to the
          Evangelical theological faculty maintained at the expense of the
          State in Vienna. Though desired by the estates for this purpose
          in the sixteenth century, it was first founded as a theological
          institute after the separation of the empire from Germany and
          the prohibition to attend German universities (Apr. 2, 1821). On
          Oct. 8, 1850 (July 18, 1861) it was made a faculty with the
          right to confer degrees, but although the only Evangelical
          theological school in all Austria, clerical intrigues,
          Protestant narrowness, and the disfavor and indifference of the
          Liberals have prevented it from being incorporated with the
          university and securing the rooms allotted to it in the new
          buildings. The school consists of six professors and two
          privat-docents; teaching Augsburg and Helvetic dogmatics
          separately. The course of study is at least six semesters, two
          of which must be spent at Vienna. Since the formation of the
          dual monarchy in 1861, which denies to Hungary all Austrian
          subventions, and as a consequence of the Hungarian legislation
          and the national excitement, the number of students at the
          theological school has diminished. In 1904-05, however,
          fifty-one were studying there, although the meager salaries
          attached to the majority of the parishes gives little hope of an
          increased student body. In 1901 a small national denominational
          Utraquist home was established at Vienna by private
          contributions for the aid of students without means, and is
          conducted by an inspector and an ephor.

    5. Financial Status of the Evangelicals.

          In view of the necessity of maintaining their churches, schools,
          and charitable organizations, the congregations have the right
          to claim State aid, but this is asked reluctantly, despite the
          heavy debts of most of the congregations, especially in Galicia.
          Outside assistance is, therefore, absolutely necessary. The
          oldest and most generous benefactor is the [784]Gustav Adolf
          Verein (q.v.) which has spent millions of florins, and which is
          divided in Austria into a main society with fifteen branch
          societies, in addition to thirty societies for women, forty-nine
          for children, and 324 local organizations. This is followed by
          the Lutherischer Gotteskasten and, more recently, by the
          Evangelischer Bund (see [785]Gotteskasten, Lutherischer;
          [786]Bund, Evangelischer), as well as by many societies and
          private benefactors in Switzerland and Holland. The property of
          the individual superintendencies is administered by committees
          of the districts concerned, while the foundations and funds of
          the superintendencies and seniories are controlled by committees
          appointed from these bodies, and also by the supreme church
          council and the Gustav Adolf Verein. These funds are devoted to
          many purposes, such as general ecclesiastical interests, the
          support of ecclesiastical officials and their widows and
          orphans, candidates for the ministry and theological students,
          general educational objects, teachers with their widows and
          orphans, religious instruction, charities, and burials. The
          Evangelical Church likewise provides pensions for superannuated
          pastors and teachers, as well as for their widows and orphans.

    6. Societies and Charities.

          Societies and charitable organizations are extremely numerous
          among the Evangelicals of Austria. Women's clubs exist in many
          city congregations, and institutions for those intending to be
          confirmed are also popular. Orphan asylums exist at Biala,
          Bielitz, Goisern, Graz, Krabschitz, Russic, Stanislau, Teleci,
          Ustron, Weikersdorf (Gallneukirchen), Waiern, and Vienna (St.
          Pölten). Summer homes are provided by the Erster Evangelischer
          Unterstützungsverein für Kinder, while the Oberösterreichischer
          Evangelischer Verein für Innere Mission cares for the sick,
          maintaining in Gallneukirchen, in addition to a house of
          deaconesses, asylums for the sick and insane, as well as homes
          for convalescents. The deaconesses trained at Gallneukirchen
          find employment at Gablonz, Graz, Hall, Marienbad, Meran, and
          Vienna, while in Aussig and Teplitz they have been placed in
          charge of the municipal hospital after the expulsion of the
          nuns. Closely connected with this society is that of the Verein
          für die Evangelische Diakonissensache in Wien with its home,
          summer sanitarium, and hospital. In 1901 a third house of
          deaconesses was established at Prague, and a number of other
          Evangelical homes and hospitals also exist. Provision is made
          for the dead and their survivors by the Evangelischer
          Leichenbestattungsverein in Vienna and by the Sterbekasse für
          Evangelische Pfarrer und Lehrer Oesterreichs. Educational
          institutions abound, while devotion is fostered by libraries of
          various types, "evenings at home," church concerts,
          Sunday-schools, Young Men's Christian Associations, and young
          women's societies. The Czech "Comenius Society," the
          "Evangelical Literary Society of the Augsburg Confession" , and
          the "Comenium," as well as the German Evangelischer
          Volksbildungverein, the first three at Prague and the last at
          Teschen, are literary in character. The only scientific
          Evangelical magazine, however, is the Jahrbuch der Gesellschaft
          für die Geschichte des Protestantismus in Oesterreich, founded
          in 1879 for the investigation and presentation of the history of
          Evangelical Protestantism.

    7. Minor Denominations and Non-Christians.

          Among other Protestant denominations, State recognition is
          accorded only to the Moravians, beginning with 1880. Baptists,
          Irvingites, Mennonites, Methodists, Congregationalists, the
          Scotch New Free Church in Vienna, and the Free Evangelical
          Church in Bohemia are regarded as undenominational, and are
          allowed to worship only in private. The Jews are now represented
          in all provinces of Austria, although previous to 1848 no Jew
          was allowed to reside in Salzburg, Styria, Carinthia, Carniola,
          Istria, Tyrol, and Vorarlberg. The Mohammedans in the army thus
          far have places of worship only in the barracks.

    8. Religious Distribution and Statistics.

          With regard to the distribution of various confessions in
          Austria, it may be said that the Greek Uniates are found chiefly
          in Galicia, the Armenian Uniates in Galicia and Bukowina, the
          Greek Catholics of the Oriental rite in Bukowina and Dalmatia,
          the Armenian Catholics of the Oriental rite in Bukowina and
          Galicia, the Jews in Lower Austria, Galicia, and Bukowina. The
          Evangelicals of the Augsburg Confession are far more evenly
          distributed than those of the Helvetic Confession, who are
          centered chiefly in Bohemia and Moravia. Almost half of those
          professing no creed are in Lower Austria. The religious
          statistics of the empire on the basis of the census of Dec. 31,
          1900, are summarized on page 381.

   Authority, Ecclesiastical
          AUTHORITY, ECCLESIASTICAL (Potestas ecclesiastica): The vested
          power of the Church over its members, by virtue of a divine
          commission (mandatum divinum) in the foundation of the Church.

    Pre-Reformation and Roman Catholic View.

          According to the pre-Reformation view and according to the same
          view as conserved by the Roman Catholic Church to-day, this
          authority is vested only in the pope and the bishops; so that
          any others can exercise it merely in their name, as their
          commissioned agents. Indeed, strictly regarded, according to the
          sense of the curia, it devolves exclusively upon the pope, so
          that even the bishops possess none but a derivative power from
          him; and in so far as this conception of the matter is
          fundamental to the Vatican, it must accordingly be regarded as
          the sense which officially obtains in the Roman Catholic church
          to-day.

          Intrinsically, to be sure, the power of the Church is a salutary
          and spiritual power even according to the pre-Reformation
          doctrine. But the commission also carries with it everything
          which appears expedient in the sight of the commissioned
          themselves, with reference to the interests and cure of souls,
          toward the appertaining regulation of external conduct. Within
          limits affecting the cure of souls, then, the Church is also
          empowered with civil functions and prerogatives. In this
          respect, the pre-Reformation doctrine distinguishes two sides or
          directions of ecclesiastical authority: an internal power
          (potestas ordinis or sacramentalis) and an external (potestas
          jurasdictionis or jurisdictionalis), the former acting upon the
          so-called forum internum, the latter upon the externum.

    Protestant View.

          The Evangelical Church, Lutheran and Reformed alike, puts a
          narrower construction upon ecclesiastical authority,
          interpreting the potestas ecclesiastica exclusively as the power
          of administering the word and sacraments in the widest sense of
          the term; which includes the cure of souls under these
          instrumentalities, but not at all the external regulation of
          conduct by the exercise of legal compulsion. The exclusion of
          the ungodly from the congregation is to be brought about without
          human power, solely through the word of God; and so this
          jurisdiction is only an act of verbal execution. Not
          infrequently in the Evangelical confessional writings,
          ecclesiastical authority is mentioned comprehensively as the "
          power of the keys" (see [787]Keys, Power of the). As such it is
          attributed not to a single estate in the Church, but to the
          Church as a whole. The power of the Church is thus committed
          immediately to the Church; intermediately and for practical
          operation the persons thereunto adopted receive it from the
          Church.

    Views of Luther and Other Reformers.

          Thus the Evangelical conception of ecclesiastical authority
          assigns to the secular powers, or as modernly expressed, the
          State, a different province in relation to the control of church
          affairs, from that of pre-Reformation times and likewise that of
          the Roman Catholic Church to-day. The Schwabach articles of 1528
          declare " the power of the Church is only to choose ministers
          and to exercise the Christian ban," and to provide for the care
          of the sick; " all other power is held either by Christ in
          heaven, or by temporal powers on earth." The reiterated
          expressions of Luther and other Reformers, to the effect that
          this temporal power has no ecclesiastical jurisdiction and may
          not interfere in church government, mean consistently this
          alone, that the temporal power has no spiritual jurisdiction and
          may not intermeddle with the cure of souls. The matter of
          control in the external affairs of the Church, that is, what we
          nowadays call church government, was deferred by Luther even so
          early as his tract to the German nobility, and at a later period
          constantly so, to the temporal powers directly; and the same is
          true of the other German Reformers. In particular, they claim
          for the Church no manner of legislative prerogative; the
          Reformation ecclesiastical law subsists rather, in so far as it
          was formulated by new legislation, entirely upon State
          enactments (see [788]Church Order). Only since the established
          reformation Church has come to be superseded more and more by
          the organized union Church on a presbyterial-synodical basis,
          has the latter, apart from the absolute administration of word
          and sacraments, been also empowered by the State with the jus
          statuendi; and this it exercises within forms and limits
          determined by the State; as it also exercises the right of
          independent church government according to its constitutional
          latitude under this organization. In both instances, however,
          this is done not upon any fundamentally intrinsic ground, but
          solely on historic grounds; and therefore, in so far as no
          unwholesome ideas come into play, without conflict with the
          State authorities.

          E. Sehling.

          In the free Churches of Great Britain, in the British colonies,
          and in the United States, there is no assumption of
          ecclesiastical authority by the civi government, its sole
          function being to protect the Churches in their right to hold
          property and to carry on their work. In many cases church
          property and in some communities where an income tax prevails
          ministers' salaries are exempted from taxation. Individuals are
          protected by the civil courts from injustice at the hands of a
          Church. Ministers may, e.g., sue for their salaries or for
          wrongful dismissal, and excommunicated members for malicious or
          unjust treatment; but even in such cases, the courts are careful
          to interfere as little as possible with the authority of the
          Churches. In each religious body the question of authority is
          determined by its polity. In episcopal bodies much authority is
          vested in individual bishops and boards of bishops, in
          presbyterial bodies in synods, in congregational bodies in the
          local church. See [789]Church Government; [790]Polity.

          was to be present, had sworn to stand by the Inquisition, and
          execute its orders, the sermon was delivered, and then judgments
          against the dead as well as the living were pronounced. Next the
          backsliders, and those who refused to recant, were expelled from
          the Church and given over to the secular authorities for
          punishment, and then the procession again began to move. The
          bones of the dead who had been condemned were carried on sledges
          to the place of execution. Those condemned to death rode on
          asses, between armed men, and wore coats and caps, called in
          Spanish sanbenito, painted over with devils and flames. Not only
          the mob and the monks, but also the magistrates, and sometimes
          even the king and the court were present at the spectacle. There
          were, however, differences in the solemnization of autos da fé
          in Southern France, in Spain, in Italy, and in the Portuguese
          colonies in India. After the middle of the eighteenth century
          they disappeared, and the verdicts of the Inquisition were
          executed in private.

   Autpertus, Ambrosius
          AUTPERTUS, AMBROSIUS: Abbot of St. Vincent at Benevento; d.
          probably in 781, though the date 778 has generally been
          accepted. He is chiefly memorable for his comprehensive
          commentary on the Apocalypse, which also gives the most reliable
          information as to his life. The brief autobiography which
          terminates it states that he was born in the province of Gaul,
          and that he began and finished his commentary in the days of
          Pope Paul I (757-767), Desiderius, king of the Lombards, and
          Arichis II, duke of Benevento. In this work, for which he
          obtained the special protection of Stephen III (752-757) against
          the attacks of the ignorant, he follows the Fathers, especially
          Augustine and Jerome; his principal purpose is the attempt to
          discover the mystical sense of the apocalyptic imagery. He is as
          much attracted by the method of spiritual interpretation offered
          by the Donatist Ticonius as was his predecessor, the " obscure"
          [792]Primasius (q.v.), in working over this heretic in an
          orthodox sense; Ticonius's seven rules [cf. DCB, iv, 1026],
          especially the sixth, de recapitulatione, governed the
          ecclesiastical exegesis of the time. But Autpertus added moral
          and devotional considerations of his own, and aimed at imitating
          the transparent clearness of Gregory the Great. The commentary
          as a whole made such an impression on Alcuin that in his own
          exposition of the Apocalypse he scarcely attempted to do more
          than make extracts from it. An uncritical eleventh century
          biography of Autpertus, contained in the Chronicon Vulturnense,
          mentions a number of other writings--commentaries on Leviticus,
          the Psalms, and the Song of Solomon, a treatise De conflictu
          vitiorum, homilies on the Gospels, and lives of the founder and
          first abbots of his monastery; these lives are poor in
          historical material, and are really an ideal picture of monastic
          life as a stimulus to the zeal of his fellow monks. Autpertus's
          own rule as abbot did not last long. His election provoked a
          schism in the monastery; he was the choice of the Frankish
          monks, while one Potho was elected by the Lombards. The contest
          was referred to Charlemagne through an accusation of treason
          brought against Potho. The king asked Adrian I to decide, and
          both competitors were summoned to Rome; Autpertus died on the
          way, and Potho was acquitted. Both the letters written by Adrian
          to Charles on the subject are addressed " nostro spiritali
          compatri" , which seems to fix their date after Adrian had
          baptized Charles's youngest son in Rome (April 15, 781), and
          thus to place the death of Autpertus later than the date given
          by the Chronicon Vulturnense, July 19, 778. His works are in
          MPL, lxxxix.

   Autun
          AUTUN, O´´tUn´: A town of France, department of Saône-et-Loire,
          160 m. s.e. of Paris. It is the old Bibracte, the capital of the
          Ædui in Cæsar's time, whose name was changed under the emperors
          to Augustodunum. It was one of the principal towns of Gallia
          Lugdunensis; its walls had a circumference of over two miles.
          The few inscriptions preserved from its early Christian period
          show that the Greek language was used in the Christian community
          there, side by side with the Latin, as late as the fourth
          century. The first bishop of whom we have certain knowledge was
          Reticius, who was present at the First Synod of Arles (316). In
          the seventh century Bishop Leodegar held a provincial synod
          there, whose decrees have only in part survived. The first canon
          contains one of the earliest distinct mentions of the Athanasian
          Creed; the fifteenth shows the progress already made in the
          Frankish kingdom by the Benedictine rule.

   Auxerre, Synod of
          AUXERRE, O´´sar´, SYNOD OF: A diocesan synod held by Bishop
          Aunachar in the Burgundian city of Auxerre, the old
          Autessiodorum or Altisiodorum in Gallia Lugdunensis, 105 m.
          s.s.e. of Paris. Thirty-four priests, three deacons, and seven
          abbots were present. Its date can be only approximately fixed,
          since all we know of Aunachar is that he took part in the Synod
          of Paris in 573 and the two Synods of Macon in 583 and 585. It
          must accordingly have been held between 570 and 590. Forty-five
          canons were passed, which have a certain importance as
          contributing to our knowledge of the pagan superstitions still
          surviving at the period and condemned in several canons.

   Auxilius
          AUXIL´IUS: German clerical author; d. after 911. He went to Rome
          in the pontificate of Formosus (891-896) to receive holy orders
          from him, as, he tells us, was common custom at the time. He
          remained in Italy, perhaps at first in Rome, but probably later
          in or near Naples, with whose bishop Stephen and archdeacon
          Peter he appears in relation. It is at least not impossible that
          he finally became a monk at Monte Cassino. We still possess four
          treatises of his, which all bear directly or indirectly on the
          controversy about Pope [793]Formosus (q.v.). That In defensionem
          sacræ ordinationes papæ Formosi, written in 908 or 909,
          describes the events leading up to the pontificate of Formosus,
          to show that these afford no ground for contesting the
          legitimacy of his episcopate, and those which followed his
          death, to prove how unjust was the sentence upon him. The aim of
          Auxilius is to prove the validity of orders conferred by
          Formosus, and the object of the three other treatises is the
          same. The second, Libellus in defensionem Stephani episcopi,
          gives not a little information about the checkered career of the
          Stephen mentioned, proving the validity of his Neapolitan
          episcopate, though he was enthroned by Benedict IV (900-903),
          who was ordained by Formosus. The third and fourth bear directly
          upon the validity of these ordinations. The works are in MPL,
          cxxix, 1053-1100, and E. Dümnler, Auxilius und Vulgarius

          AVA: The first German poetess; d. at Melk (on the Danube, 50 m.
          w. of Vienna), or a neighboring convent of Lower Austria, Feb.
          8, 1127. A number of poems are ascribed to her, of which the
          most important and most certainly genuine is described in one of
          the manuscripts as treating of " the life, passion, and
          resurrection of the Lord, and of the Holy Spirit, according to
          the gospels; of the Last Judgment and Antichrist, and of the
          delights of heaven."

          A later manuscript includes the life of John the Baptist. Two
          sons are said to have helped in its composition, who are thought
          to have been two poets known from other works, named Hartmann
          and Heinrich. The former was educated for the priesthood at
          Passau, became prior of St. Blasien in 1094, then abbot of
          Göttweih, founded the monastery of Lambrecht in 1096, and died
          in 1114. The latter was a layman and probably survived Hartmann.
          Ava was a reclusa, but conjectures as to her sinful early life
          and later ascetic practises are based upon the doubtful works
          and are hardly justified by these. The poem as preserved is not
          composite. It displays real poetic gifts and, in the choice of
          incidents as well as in their treatment, indicates that the
          author was a woman, with no trace, however, of feminine
          enthusiasm. The material is drawn from the gospels and the Acts,
          for the presentation of Antichrist and the Last Judgment from
          Rev. xvii-xx. The aim seems to have been to present a simple
          narrative in poetic form of the great deeds of God in the new
          covenant similar to treatments of Genesis, Exodus, and other
          parts of the Pentateuch which are known to have been already in
          existence. There is no homiletical coloring, and moral
          reflections and allegory are avoided. The separation of the good
          and the bad at the Last Judgment gives opportunity for a brief
          but instructive picture of social conditions of the time, which
          indicates personal familiarity with the sins of the higher
          classes. The time of composition was probably about 1120.

   Avars, The
          AVARS, THE: A tribe related to the Huns, who from the middle of
          the sixth century came into contact with the Christian
          nations--first with the Byzantine empire, and then with the
          Frankish kingdom; but they learned Christianity from neither of
          these. Virgil of Salzburg seems to have been the first to
          attempt their conversion, and Charlemagne supported him. Duke
          Tassilo of Bavaria summoned them to Germany as allies against
          him; in 788 they attacked the Frankish kingdom from two sides,
          but were repulsed on both, and the struggle ended with their
          complete subjugation in 796, when they accepted Christianity as
          one of the conditions of peace. The territory thus won for
          Charlemagne and Christian missions extended from the Enns and
          the slopes of the Styrian Alps to the Danube. It was divided
          between the dioceses of Aquileia, Salzburg, and Passau. The
          Avars, however, soon afterward disappeared from history,
          probably being absorbed by the Slavic population which formed a
          majority in their territory.

   Avercius, (Avircius, Abercius), of Hieropolis
          AVERCIUS, a-ver´shiUs (AVIRCIUS, ABERCIUS), OF HIEROPOLIS (in
          the Glaucus valley, not Hierapolis on the Lycus): A Phrygian,
          the inscription on whose gravestone is preserved in a legendary
          life, written probably about 400, and was found, in part, on a
          portion of the actual stone by W. M. Ramsay in 1883 at the warm
          baths near Hieropolis. The inscription, with restorations, may
          be rendered as follows:

          I, the citizen of a noble city, have made this (monument) in my
          lifetime that I might have here a resting-place in the eyes of
          men for my body, Avercius by name, the servant of a holy
          shepherd who pastures flocks of sheep upon the hills and
          meadows; whose eyes are large and all-seeing; for he taught me
          . . . writings worthy of faith. To Rome he sent me that I might
          see the king and the queen in golden apparel with sandals of
          gold. But I saw a people there bearing a shining seal. I saw
          likewise the plains of Syria and all its cities (as well as)
          Nisibis, after I had crossed the Euphrates. But everywhere I had
          a companion, for Paul sat in the chariot with me. And Faith led
          the way (as guide) and in all places set before me as food a
          fish from the spring, gigantic, pure, which a holy virgin had
          caught. And this (fish) he (Faith) gave at all times as food to
          friends,--(Faith) who has good wine, giving mixed drink and
          bread. This have I, Avercius, while I stood by, ordered to be
          written down; seventy-two years old was I when it was done. You
          who understand the meaning of this, pray for Avercius, every one
          that is of the same mind. In my grave let no one lay another.
          But if any one do so, he shall pay to the treasury of the Romans
          2,000, and to the loved native city Hieropolis 1,000, pieces of
          gold.

          From this wording G. Ficker concludes that Avercius was a priest
          of Cybele, while Harnack would make him out the member of a sect
          partially Gnostic, partially heathen, wherein pagan mysteries
          were combined with one of the mysteries of the Christian faith,
          namely, the Lord's Supper. The weight of authority, however, is
          in favor of the Christian character of the inscription. It must
          be dated somewhere about 200,--a time when it was not safe to
          make too open profession of Christian faith; hence Avercius
          phrases his confession in mysterious language which has a double
          meaning, yet is easily intelligible to one " who understands."
          The life already referred to supports this view, being based
          apparently on a well-established local legend corroborative in
          many details of the writing on the tombstone. Possibly the
          author may have been the Avercius Marcellus, a native of
          Phrygia, to whom a work against the Montanists was dedicated
          about the year 193 (Eusebius, Hist. eccl., v, 16). As internal
          evidence, are cited the unmistakable allusion to the Lord's
          Supper, to baptism (the " shining seal" ), and the reference to
          Paul, which may be taken to mean either that Avercius had the
          works of the apostle with him on his travels or compared his own
          journey to that of Paul from Damascus to the west. The
          inscription is now in the Lateran museum at Rome.

   Avignon
          AVIGNON, a´´vî´´nyen´: The capital of the department of
          Vaucluse, southern France, situated on the Rhone, about 400 m.
          s.s.e. of Paris, and 50 m. n.n.w. of Marseilles. It became the
          papal residence in 1309, at which time it was under the rule of
          the kings of Sicily (the house of Anjou); in 1348 Pope Clement
          VI bought it from Queen Joanna I of Sicily for 80,000 gold
          gulden, and it remained a papal possession till 1791, when,
          during the disorders of the French Revolution, it was
          incorporated with France. Seven popes resided there,--Clement V,
          John XXII, Benedict XII, Clement VI, Innocent VI, Urban V, and
          Gregory XI; and during this period (1309-77; the so-called
          Babylonian Captivity of the popes) it was a gay and corrupt
          city. The antipopes Clement VII and Benedict XIII continued to
          reside there, the former during his entire pontificate
          (1378-94), the latter until 1408, when he fled to Aragon.
          Avignon was the seat of a bishop as early as the year 70, and
          became an archbishopric in 1476. Several synods of minor
          importance were held there, and its university, founded by Pope
          Boniface VIII in 1303 and famed as a seat of legal studies,
          flourished until the French Revolution. The walls built by the
          popes in the years immediately succeeding the acquisition of
          Avignon as papal territory are well preserved. The papal palace,
          a lofty Gothic building, with walls 17-18 feet thick, built
          1335-64, long used as a barrack, is now to be turned into a
          museum.

   Avila, Juan de
          AVILA, a´vî-la, JUAN DE: Ascetic writer, called the apostle of
          Andalusia; b. at Almodovar del Campo (16 m. s.w. of Ciudad Real)
          in the archdiocese of Toledo, between 1494 and 1500; d. in
          Montilla (18 m. s.e. of Cordova) May 10, 1569. In 1516 he
          entered the University of Salamanca to study law, but soon
          retired to his home and lived a strict ascetic life for three
          years. Then he studied theology at Alcala under Domingo de Soto.
          Having been admitted to orders, he continued his ascetic life
          and won fame as a preacher in different places. Through envy he
          was brought before the Inquisition and refused to defend
          himself, but was acquitted for his exemplary life. At the age of
          fifty he went into retirement, broken in body by his exertions
          in preaching and ascetic practises; thenceforth he addressed
          smaller circles and devoted himself to writing. He declined a
          profferred appointment as canon in Grenada, as well as the
          bishopric of Segovia and the archbishopric of Grenada. His tomb
          in the Jesuits' Church at Montilla bears the inscription,
          Magistro Johanni Avilæ, Patri optimo, Viro integerrimo, Deique
          amantissimo, Filii ejus in Christo, Pos [uerunt]. His writings
          were collected in nine volumes at Madrid, 1757; the chief were
          Audi filia and the Cartas espirituales (in vol. xiii of the
          Biblioteca de Autores Españoles, Madrid, 1850).

   Avitus, Alcimus Ecdicius
          AVITUS, a-vai´tUs, ALCIMUS ECDICIUS: Bishop of Vienne; d. Feb.
          5, 518. He was born of a distinguished Romano-Gallic family,
          connected with the Emperor Avitus (455-456); his father,
          Hesychius, was bishop of Vienne, where the son seems to have
          been educated, probably in the involved and fanciful rhetorical
          style of Sapaudus, who was then teaching there. In 494 we find
          him mentioned as his father's successor in the see; and until
          the death of Gundobad (516) he exercised a predominant influence
          on the Church of Burgundy, and through it on the civil
          government. He induced Gundobad's son, Sigismund, to renounce
          Arianism, and the old king himself listened gladly to Avitus and
          seemed disposed to follow this example. In the contest over
          boundaries between the metropolitan sees of Vienne and Arles,
          Avitus won a decisive victory under Pope Anastasius II
          (496-498). He was a zealous supporter of the close connection
          between the south of Gaul and the Roman see which was restored
          in 494, and did his best to promote the power of the latter. His
          political influence was far from salutary; since it was
          exercised mainly for ecclesiastical ends. His theology was
          dominated by his opposition to Arianism and other kindred
          heresies; otherwise he appears to have been chiefly interested
          in questions of ritual and church law. His last great success
          was to call and preside over the Burgundian council at Epao in
          517, some of whose canons show his authorship, even in their
          wording. His prose writings consist partly of sermons, partly of
          letters, which, as was customary at that time, attain the
          dimensions of complete tractatas. These have some historical
          value, which would be greater if we could establish a more
          secure chronology for them. The most famous is Epist. xlvi
          (xli), addressed to Clovis in the beginning of 497. Epist. xxxiv
          (xxxi) is important for the light which it throws upon his
          attitude in regard to ecclesiastical polity. Here he speaks for
          the Gallic episcopate in relation to the Roman contest arising
          out of the charges against Pope Symmachus. This noteworthy
          manifesto unfolds an entire ultramontane programme, addressed to
          the senators Faustus and Symmachus, probably at the end of 501.
          Some of his oratorical productions are interesting, but more
          important is his poetical work, an epic dealing with the origin
          of the human race, and a didactic poem. The former is called by
          Ebert " at least in regard to its plan, the most significant
          contribution to the poetical treatment of the Bible in early
          Christian literature." It seems to have been composed in the
          last decade of the fifth century, and consists of 2,522
          hexameter verses, divided into five books which carry the
          history of the world from its creation through the fall of man
          (in which Satan is drawn as an imposing figure reminding of
          Milton) to the Flood and the Exodus. It is much more than a bald
          transcript of the Biblical text, and frequently goes off into
          long typological trains of thought.

   Aviz, Order of
          AVIZ, a´´vîz´, ORDER OF: An association of knights founded about
          1145 by King Alfonso I of Portugal to extend his dominions into
          Moorish territory to the south. They were originally called nova
          militia; when Alfonso captured Evora from the Moors (1166) he
          gave it to the knights as their seat and they took the name "
          Brethren of St. Maria of Evora," and after 1211, when Alfonso II
          gave them the town of Aviz (75 m. n.e. of Lisbon), they were
          known as the " Brethren (or Knights) of Aviz." Their
          constitution, which, besides the three customary vows, imposed
          also the obligation to fight against the infidels, was prepared
          in its main outlines by the Cistercian abbot Johannes Civita
          about 1162. Like the [798]Order of Alcantara (q.v.) the Knights
          of Aviz were for a time dependent upon the [799]Order of
          Calatrava (q.v.), but at the beginning of the fifteenth century
          they obtained their independence, and successfully resisted an
          attempt of the Council of Basel to restore the supremacy of the
          Calatrava Order. Toward the end of the Middle Ages they received
          dispensation from the vow of celibacy and were allowed to marry
          once. In 1789 the order was changed into one of military merit
          and the ecclesiastical vows were abolished.

   Awakening
          AWAKENING: A term which in recent times has occasionally been
          mentioned in Protestant dogmatics as a member of the ordo
          salutis (see [800]Order of Salvation). Elsewhere the term is
          used, especially in the language of the Pietists and Methodists,
          to designate the great commotion produced in the heart,
          especially by preaching. To this usage corresponds also the
          popular conception which understands by the term " awakening"
          specifically the stirring of strong religious feelings, such as
          at times accompany the beginning of the Christian estate. In
          this sense books or sermons are characterized as " awakening,"
          and periods of history in which there is a rapid change of
          religious feeling are called " times of awakening."

          So far as the Biblical basis for the conception is concerned,
          the sources are quite meager. Only Rom. xiii, 11 and Eph. v, 14
          come into consideration. In both passages the act of awakening
          is placed in close connection with the light or illumination. He
          who is brought into the sphere of the light, does not continue
          to sleep, but awakes out of his sleep and then by the awaking is
          illuminated by the light. If the work of grace be considered as
          an enlightenment, then its first effect in man is that of
          awaking. According to the Biblical usage, therefore, we are to
          think neither of a special divine act of " awaking" nor of a
          condition, having temporal duration, of " awaking" or " becoming
          awake." There are, however, some recent dogmaticians who take
          these positions (e.g., C. I. Nitzsch, System der christlichen
          Lehre, Bonn, 1851, pp. 298, 304-305; L. A. Dorner,
          Glaubenslehre, vol. ii, part 2, Berlin, 1881, 725-728; F. Reiff
          , Christliche Glaubenslehre, ii, Basel, 1873, 349; F. Nitzsch,
          Lehrbuch der Dogmatik, Freiburg, 1892, p. 593). [801]Calling
          (q.v.) is then divided into [802]illumination (q.v.), which aims
          to give a knowledge of salvation, and awakening, which directs
          the will to the salvation. Others, on the contrary, emphasize
          more the subjective condition of the awakening. It is the
          introduction to regeneration; the awakened is " mightily moved
          by grace" ; it is a " condition of religious suffering," for as
          yet there is no self-determination (Martensen, Die christliche
          Dogmatik, Berlin, 1870, pp. 361-362); it is " a moment in which
          the soul is more profoundly seized by grace," " the birth throes
          of the new man," where " there is still too much being built
          upon feeling and sensibility" (Thomasius, Lehre von Christi
          Person und Werk, ii, Leipsic, 1888, 377, 384; cf. Luthardt,
          Kompendium der Dogmatik, Leipsic, 1893, p. 264; Wacker, Die
          Heilsordnung, Gütersloh, 1898, pp. 33, 34). Of special interest
          is the representation of " awakening" given by the dogmatician
          of German Methodism, A. Sulzberger (cf. Die christliche
          Glaubenslehre, ii, Bremen, 1876, 368 sqq.). But in spite of
          these and other efforts to give the term " awakening" a place in
          dogmatics, the necessity of the conception can not be
          maintained. Objectively, it adds nothing to " calling," and,
          subjectively, it has no specific connotation as against the
          first beginnings of faith and " conversion" in the old
          dogmatics. Here as in general, the undue subdividing of the ordo
          salutis is to be opposed.

   Ayer, Joseph Cullen, Jr.
          AYER, JOSEPH CULLEN, JR.: Protestant Episcopalian; b. at
          Newtonville, Mass., Jan. 7, 1866. He was educated at Harvard
          University and the universities of Berlin, Halle, and Leipsic
          (Ph.D., 1893), and at the Episcopal Theological School,
          Cambridge, Mass., from which he was graduated in 1887. He was
          honorary fellow at Johns Hopkins in 1899-1900, and in the
          following year was appointed lecturer on canon law in the
          Cambridge Theological School. In 1905 he was chosen professor of
          ecclesiastical history in the Divinity School of the Protestant
          Episcopal Church in Philadelphia. His theological position is
          that of a conservative Broad-churchman or a liberal
          High-churchman. In addition to numerous briefer studies on canon
          law, music, and painting, in various reviews, and, besides
          contributions to the second, third, and fourth volumes of The
          World's Orators (New York, 1900), he has written Die Ethik

   Aylmer, John
          AYLMER, êl-mer (ELMER), JOHN: Bishop of London; b. at Aylmer
          Hall, parish of Tivetshall St. Mary (15 m. s. of Norwich),
          Norfolk, England, 1521; d. in London June 3,1594. He studied at
          Cambridge (B.A., 1541) and was tutor to Lady Jane Grey; was made
          Archdeacon of Stow in 1553. During the reign of Mary he retired
          to Strasburg and Zurich, and wrote there a reply to John Knox's
          Monstrous Regiment of Women (Geneva, 1558), under the title An
          Harborowe [Harbor] for Faithful and True Subjects against the
          late blown blast concerning the government of women (Strasburg,
          1559). He returned to England shortly after the accession of
          Elizabeth (1558) and was made archdeacon of Lincoln in 1562,
          bishop of London in 1577. He was a somewhat narrow-minded man,
          of arbitrary and arrogant temper, and as bishop displayed a
          harshness toward Puritans and Roman Catholics which brought upon
          him much unpopularity and exposed him to the biting satire of
          the [805]Marprelate tracts (q.v.); yet he was a man of learning
          and a patron of scholars. Besides the volume already mentioned
          he left sermons and devotional works.

   Azazel
          AZAZEL a-zê´zel or a-za´zel (Heb. aza'zel): The word translated
          " scapegoat" in the A. V., found only in Lev. xvi, in the
          legislation concerning the Day of Atonement, where the high
          priest is directed to take two goats as sin-offering for the
          people, to choose by lot one of them " for Yahweh" and the other
          " for Azazel" (ver. 8), and to send the latter forth into the
          wilderness (ver. 10, 21-22; see [808]Atonement, Day of ). The
          meaning of the word has occasioned much discussion. Starting
          from the fact that " for Yahweh" and " for Azazel" stand in
          opposition (ver. 8), many think that it is the name of a being
          opposed to Yahweh,--a desert-monster, a demon, or directly
          Satan. Such as attempt an etymological interpretation then
          explain it as characterizing the demon or Satan as removed or
          apostatized from God, or a being repelled by men (averruncus),
          or one which does things apart and in secret (from azal, " to go
          away" ). Others conceive of Azazel, not as a proper name, but as
          an appellative noun and modified reduplicated form of a root
          azal, " to remove, retire," signifying longe remotus or porro
          abiens. The sense of verses 8, 10, and 26, then, is that the
          goat is designated by the lot as an azazel, i.e., something
          which is to go far away, and is sent into the wilderness as
          such; and the idea is expressed symbolically that with the
          sending away of the goat, sin has also been removed from the
          people for whom atonement has been made, and they regard
          themselves as freed and released from their sins. The contrast
          between " for Yahweh" and " for Azazel," however, in ver. 8
          favors the interpretation of Azazel as a proper noun, and a
          reference to Satan suggests itself. It has been urged that
          nowhere else in the Pentateuch is Satan mentioned, and that
          afterward, when the idea of Satan comes out more fully in the
          consciousness of the Old Testament congregation, the name Azazel
          is not found. But it may be that Azazel--whatever its meaning
          may be--was the name of an old heathen idol or of one belonging
          to Semitic mythology and thought of as the evil principle, which
          older Judaism made the head of the demons as later Judaism used
          the name of the Philistine Baal Zebub. A definite explanation,
          satisfactory to all, can hardly be looked for. The name of
          Azazel, like Belial and Beelzebub, is transferred from the Old
          Testament language into the Book of Enoch as designation of a
          power of evil.

   Azymites
          AZYMITES, a-zim´aits (Gk. azymitai, from a-privative and zyme, "
          leaven" ): An epithet given by the Greek Church to the Latin
          Church from the eleventh century, because the latter uses
          unleavened bread in the Lord's Supper. [809]Michael Cærularius,
          Patriarch of Constantinople (q.v.), in 1053 attacked the
          practise of the Western Church, declaring their Eucharist
          worthless because unleavened bread was lifeless and powerless. A
          hot contest ensued in which the Latins maintained that either
          leavened or unleavened bread could be used; they retaliated upon
          their opponents with the epithets fermentarii or fermentacei
          (from Lat. fermentum, " leaven" ) and prozymitai (from Gk. pro,
          " for," and zyme). The Council of Florence (1439) decreed that
          each Church must follow its own custom, and for the Latin Church
          to change would be grievous sin. See [810]Lord's Supper.

   [2] Part of the information concerning Roman Catholic missions in this
   article has been furnish by Prof. John T. Creagh.

   [3] In combating the legalistic element in medieval Roman Catholic
   teaching and in the radical religious parties of the early Reformation
   time, Luther allowed himself to use language in disparagement of the
   Mosaic law so strong and unqualified as to give great encouragement to
   those that were eager for fleshly freedom. A few sentences should be
   quoted: "Christ is not harsh, severe, biting as Moses. . . . Therefore,
   away with Moses forever, who shall not terrify deluded hearts." Again:
   "The gospel is heavenly and divine, the law earthly and human; the
   righteousness of the gospel is just as distinct from that of the law as
   heaven from earth, as light from darkness. The gospel is light and day,
   the law darkness and night." In his polemic "against the Heavenly
   Prophets" (Erl. ed., xxix. 150) he says: "We will take our stand on the
   right ground and say that these sin-teachers and Mosaic prophets shall
   leave us unconfounded by Moses; we will neither see nor hear Moses. How
   does this please you, dear revolutionists? And we say further that all
   such Mosaic teachers [i.e., the [811]Zwickau prophets] deny the gospel,
   banish Christ, and overthrow the whole New Testament. I speak now as a
   Christian and for Christians, since Moses was given to the Jewish
   people alone and has nothing to do with us Gentiles and Christians. We
   have our gospel and New Testament; if they will prove from this that
   pictures are to be done away with, we will gladly follow them. But if
   they wish by means of Moses to make Jews of us, we will not suffer it."
   Of course, he did not mean utterly to repudiate Moses, but rather by a
   tour de force to repudiate what he considered an unauthorized use of
   Moses. (A. H. N.)

   [4] The more important of Agricola's eighteen propositions are: i.
   Repentance is to be taught not from the decalogue or any law of Moses,
   but from the suffering and death of the Son through the gospel. ii. For
   Christ says in the last chapter of Luke: "Thus it behooved Christ to
   die and in this manner to enter into his glory, that repentance and
   remission of sins might be preached in his name." iii. And Christ, in
   John, says that the Spirit, not the law, convicts the world of sin. iv.
   The last discourse of Christ teaches the same thing: "Go, preach the
   gospel to every creature." vii. Without anything whatever the Holy
   Spirit is given and men are justified: this thing [the law] is not
   necessary to be taught either for the beginning, the middle, or the end
   of justification. viii. But the Holy Spirit having been given of old is
   also given perpetually, and men are justified without the law through
   the gospel concerning Christ alone. xiii. Wherefore, for conserving
   purity of doctrine we must resist those who teach that the gospel is
   not to be preached except to those who have been crushed and made
   contrite through the law. xvi. The law only convicts of sin and that,
   too, without the Holy Spirit; therefore it convicts unto damnation.
   xvii. But there is need of a doctrine that not only with great efficacy
   condemns, but also at the same time saves: but that is the gospel,
   which teaches conjointly repentance and remission of sins. xviii. For
   the gospel of Christ teaches the wrath from heaven and at the same time
   the justice of God, Rom. i. For it is the preaching of repentance
   joined to a promise which reason does not naturally apprehend, but
   which comes through divine revelation. Luther added to these
   acknowledged articles of Agricola several other statements of doubtful
   authenticity which Agricola was supposed to have made: The law is not
   worthy to be called the word of God. Art thou a harlot, a knave, an
   adulterer, or any other sort of sinner if thou believest thou art in
   the way of salvation. The decalogue belongs to the town hall, and not
   to the pulpit. All who go about with Moses must go to the devil. To the
   gallows with Moses! To hear the word and live accordingly is the
   consequence of the law. To hear the word and feel it in the heart is
   the proper consequence of the gospel. Peter knew nothing about
   Christian freedom. His declaration "making your calling sure through
   good works" is good for nothing. As soon as thou thinkest it must go
   thus and so in Christendom, everybody is to be refined, honorable,
   discreet, holy, and chaste, thou hast already prostituted the gospel.
   Agricola disowned the most manifestly immoral of these propositions,
   and there is no reason to believe that he practised or approved of the
   immorality that seems involved in his teachings. A. H. N.

   [5] It is Thomas Arnold, if any one, who must be regarded as the
   pioneer of free theology in England. . . . He was the first to show to
   his countrymen the possibility, and to make the demand, that the Bible
   should be read with honest human eyes, without the spectacles of
   orthodox dogmatic presuppositions, and that it can, at the same time be
   revered with Christian piety and made truly productive in moral life.
   He was the first who dared to leave on one side the traditional
   phraseology of the High-churchmen and the Evangelicals, and to look
   upon Christianity, not as a sacred treasure of the Churches and the
   sects, but as a divine beneficent power for every believer; not as a
   dead heritage from the past, but as a living spiritual power for the
   moral advancement of individuals and nations in the present. . . . He
   showed how classical and general historical studies may be pursued in
   the light of the moral ideas of Christianity, and how, on the other
   hand, a free and clear way of looking at things may be obtained by
   means of wide historical knowledge, and then applied to the
   interpretation of the Bible and the solution of current ecclesiastical
   questions. Thus he began to pull down the wall of separation which had
   out off the religious life of his fellow countrymen, with their sects
   and Churches and rigid theological formulas and usages, from the
   general life and pursuits of the nation. It is also clear as day that,
   if longer life had been granted him, the result of the further
   prosecution of his historical studies . . . would have been further
   insight and courage to apply his historical and critical principles to
   the Bible. At all events, his work was subsequently further prosecuted
   in this direction by his friends and pupils.--Pfleiderer, The
   Development of Theology in Germany since Kant and its Progress in Great
   Britain since 1825 (London, 1890), 367-368.

   [6] He visited Massachusetts 23 times after 1791 . . . the state of New
   York 56 times, New Jersey 62 times, Pennsylvania 78 times, Delaware 33
   times, Maryland 80 times, North Carolina 63 times, South Carolina 46
   times, Virginia 84 times, Tennessee and Georgia each 20 times, and
   other states or territories with corresponding frequency. In his
   unparalleled career he preached about 16,500 sermons, or at least one a
   day, and traveled about 270,000 miles, or 6,000 a year, presiding in no
   lees than 224 annual conferences, and ordaining more than 4,000
   preachers.--Janes, p. 5. When he came to America the Methodists
   numbered 10 preachers and 600 members; when he died, after forty-five
   years of work, they had 695 preachers and 214,235 members.

          BAADER, ba´der, FRANZ XAVER VON: Roman Catholic philosopher; b.
          at Munich Mar. 27, 1765; d. there May 23, 1841. He studied and
          practised medicine, afterward became a mining engineer, and,
          after a visit to England (1791-96), held official positions in
          the Bavarian department of mines. In 1826 he became professor of
          philosophy and speculative theology at Munich. In 1838, having
          opposed the interference of the Church in civil affairs, he was
          forbidden to lecture on religion and thenceforth confined
          himself to psychology and anthropology. He was an original and
          suggestive thinker, and exercised considerable influence on his
          own and the succeeding generation, although the aphoristic and
          paradoxical form in which he presented his thought often makes
          it difficult to understand him. He sought for a deep and true
          understanding of Christianity, always with the conviction that "
          the legitimate organs had lost the key." A tendency toward
          individual judgment caused the Roman Catholics to reject him as
          one of their philosophers; he considered the papacy an equivocal
          institution not essential to the Church, and contrasted the
          Eastern and Western Churches unfavorably to the latter (in Der
          morgenländische und der abendländische Katholicismus, Stuttgart,
          1841). At the same time he was a theosophist rather than a
          philosopher or theologian, and sought the lost key in the
          mystical speculations of Eckhart, St. Martin, and Böhme; hence
          he was equally out of sympathy with the rationalistic tendencies
          of nineteenth century theology. His system is set forth in his
          Fermenta cognitionis (parts i-v, Berlin, 1822-24; part vi,
          Leipsic, 1825) and Vorlesungen über spekulative Dogmatik (part
          i, Stuttgart, 1828; parts ii-v, Münster, 1830-38). His works,
          collected and edited by his scholars (Franz Hoffmann, Hamberger,
          Emil von Schaden, Lutterbeck, von Osten, Schlüter), appeared in
          16 vols., Leipsic, 1851-60; vol. xv contains a biography by
          Hoffmann.

    1. Various Forms of the Name.

          Baal is frequently mentioned in the Old Testament as a god of
          the idolatrous Israelites, as well as of the Phenicians,
          Philistines, and Moabites (?). The name also occurs in a proper
          name of the Edomites, in Phenician and Aramaic inscriptions, in
          Greek and Roman authors (Baal, Bal), in the Septuagint and
          writings dependent on it, and in Josephus. Greek and Latin
          writers for the most part speak of Bel, Belos, Bel as a
          Babylonian as well as a Syrian and Phenician god. The form Bal
          is more frequently found in composite Phenician proper names as
          Abibalos, Hannibal, etc., according to which the Phenicians
          pronounced the name of the god bal (cf. P. Schröder, Die
          phönizische Sprache, Halle, 1869, p. 84). The Phenicians carried
          their religion wherever they went, and thus the worship of Baal
          was very widely spread. Even the Semitic Hyksos in Egypt,
          according to Egyptian testimony, worshiped the god Bar (= Baal;
          cf. E. Meyer, Set-Typhon, Leipsic, 1875, p. 47, and ZDMG, xxxi,
          1877, p. 725; W. Max Müller, Asien und Europa nach
          altägyptischen Denkmälern, Leipsic, 1893, p. 309).

    2. Meaning and Use of the Name.

          There can be no doubt of the identity of the names Baal and Bel,
          the Babylonian god mentioned in the Old Testament, the Bel or
          Belos of the Greeks, i.e., the Assyrian Belu (Bilu) contracted
          from Beel, which is modified from Baal by the influence of the
          guttural. In an Esarhaddon inscription Z?il-Bel (" Baal is
          protection" ) is the name of a king of Haziti, i.e., of Gaza (E.
          Schrader, Keilinschriften und Geschichtsforschung, Giessen,
          1878, pp. 78-79), where Bel is evidently used for the Canaanitic
          Baal. The " bol" in the names of the Palmyrene deities Aglibol
          and Yaribol (and " bel" in Malakbel) may be still another form
          of Baal.

          The Hebrew word baal means " owner" or " lord," also " husband,"
          as possessor of the wife. The names of Semitic divinities all
          set forth the idea of power, and thus present a conception
          different from that of the Aryan divinities (cf. A. Deissman, in
          The Expository Times; xviii, 205 sqq.). Furthermore, it has been
          disputed whether baal in the sense of " lord" was an epithet of
          honor attached to divinity in general, or was given as a proper
          name to a definite local god. In favor of the latter supposition
          is the fact that there was a Baal of Tyre, a Baal of Sidon, a
          Baal of Harran, a Baal of Tarsus, and so on. When in later times
          many such local deities were worshiped in close proximity, the
          name " Baal" designated the principal god of a place; for he
          alone could there be called the owner or lord. From this can be
          explained the later confusion between the Canaanitic Baal and
          the Babylonian Bel, also the fact that Baal was called Zeus by
          the Greeks and Jupiter by the Romans. When baal occurs in the
          Old Testament with the article, this does not prove that there
          was a special god called Baal; it shows only that baal appears
          in the Old Testament not as a proper name but rather as an
          appellative noun. The use of the article in the Old Testament
          can be explained from this, that in cases where the Old
          Testament speaks of an actual Baal-cult, some one Baal among the
          many is meant; the later Old Testament usage, especially that of
          Jeremiah, employed " the baal" in the sense of " the idol."

    3. The Conception of Baal.

          If Baal were merely the designation of some god as owner of a
          place of worship or the honorary title of a god, an inquiry into
          the common meaning of the word would not be necessary. But such
          an in quiry is suggested by the statements concerning the Baals
          of different places. From the Arabic appellative meaning of the
          word, it has been supposed that in places naturally irrigated
          the deity was worshiped as the Baal of that place. According to
          Hosea (ii, 15), the idolatrous Israelites imagined that the
          conception of gods worshiped by them, whom the Baal. prophet
          otherwise calls "the Baals," were the authors of the good things
          of nature. Sacred springs are also found in places where the
          Tyrian Heracles was worshiped. But this does not necessarily
          imply that some special terrestrial notion must be connected
          with Baal. It is easy to understand how among an agricultural
          people like the Canaanites, the god of heaven could be conceived
          as god of agriculture, for the field can not produce without the
          blessing of heaven. But it is possible that in different
          Baal-cults a Vestrial idea and the conception of Baal as heaven
          god, at first distinct and separate, afterward grew together, as
          in the case of Astarte (see Astorew). It is erroneous to assert
          that every individual god who had the name of Baal was
          worshipped as lord of heaven; still more so to hold that each
          was especially worshiped as a sun-god, or that Baal was
          everywhere and at all times so represented. While there is no
          evidence of the solar meaning of Baal, it is certain that the
          Phenicians at times attributed to their Baal or Baals some solar
          characteristics. As generally in the Phenician deities,
          beneficent and destructive powers were not separated but were
          represented as being combined in one and the same deity, so it
          was with Baal, so far at least as both powers were thought of as
          proceeding from heaven or more particularly from the sun. That
          Baal bestows natural blessing, has been seen above. Names like
          HannZal " grace of Baal," Asdrubal " Baal helps," Baal-shams "
          Baal hears," Baal-shamar " Baal keeps," and the like, designate
          him as a benevolent god. That human sacrifices were offered to
          Baal can not be inferred from the Old Testament. The passages
          Jer. xix, 5; xxxii, 35 speak of children who were offered to
          Moloch, and the Baal mentioned there is only a general
          designation of the idol. That the Baal-prophets cut themselves
          in the service of their god (I Kings xviii, 28) can not be
          regarded as a substitute for human sacrifice. The representative
          animal of Baal was the bull, which also represented the ancient
          god of the Hebrews.

    4. Special Baals in the Old Testament.

          Certain Baals are named in the Old Testament with epithets which
          designate them more exactly: (a) Baal-Berith, worshiped by the
          Shechemites (Judges ix, 4; cf. verse 46; viii, 33), denotes
          probably the protector of a definite covenant or "the Baal
          before whom agreements are made." (b) Baal-Peor (Num. xxv, 3, 5;
          Deut. iv, 3; Hos. ix, 10; Ps. cvi, 28), also simply Peor (Num.
          xxv, 18; xxxi, 16; Josh. xxii, 17; cf. the name of a Moabite
          city Beth-Peor, "temple of Peor," Deut. iii, 29; iv, 46; xxxiv,
          6; Josh. xiii, 20), was a god of the Moabites (Num. xxv, 1-5) or
          of the Midianites (Num. xxv, 18, xxxi, 16), worshiped on Mount
          Peor, where the Israelites committed whoredom with the daughters
          of Moab (Num. xxv, 1) or Midian (Num. xxv, 8). (c) Baal-Zebub,
          see [812]Beelzebub. Certain place-names compounded with Baal
          (not necessarily all, cf. II Sam. v, 20) were originally
          god-names, the word beth (" temple" ) being understood in the
          place-name. Baals known from such place-names are: (d) Baal-Gad
          (Josh. xi, 17; xii, 7; xiii, 5), the "fortune-bringing Baal."
          Gad (Isa. lxv, 11; perhaps also Gen. xxx, 11) occurs
          independently as a name of a deity (see [813]Gad). (e)
          Baal-Hermon (Judges iii, 3; I Chron. v, 23), usually identified
          with Baal-Gad, the designation of the Baal worshiped on Mount
          Hermon. (f) Baal-Meon (Num. xxxii, 38; Ezek. xxv, 9; I Chron. v,
          8), the god of a Moabite (Reubenite) city, the full name of
          which reads Beth-Baal-Meon (Josh. xiii, 17), contracted into
          Beth-Meon (Jer. xlviii, 23), i.e., "temple of the Baal of Meon."
          (g) It is possible that Baal-Zephon (Exod. xiv, 2, 9; Num.
          xxxiii, 7), the name of a station of the Israelites on the Red
          Sea, belongs here. Zephon, or more correctly Zaphon, is known as
          a god-name from Egyptian, Phenician, Carthaginian, and Assyrian
          inscriptions. Baal-Tamar, a place mentioned in Judg. xx, 33, may
          also be derived from the name of a god, and Baal-Hamon (Song of
          Sol. viii, 11), Baal-Hazor (II Sam. xiii, 23), Baal-Perazim (II
          Sam. v, 20), and Baal-Shalisha (I Sam. ix, 4; II Kings iv, 42)
          were probably designations of local deities, of whom nothing is
          known.

    5. The Baal-cult in Israel.

          There can be no doubt that, in ancient times, the Hebrews called
          their god the Baal, whether they used this name to designate
          Yahweh, or a special Baal worshiped beside him. The latter can
          not be proved; the former is indicated by names of the Davidic
          time compounded with Baal. The worship of the Canaanite Baals in
          opposition to the Yahweh-worship had many adherents among the
          Israelites as early as the time of the Judges (Judges ii, 11,
          13; iii, 7; vi, 25 sqq.; x, 6; I Sam. vii, 4; xii, 10). There is
          no proof that the Hebrews upon their settlement in Canaan
          adopted the Baal-cult practised there, but the fact can hardly
          be doubted. The earliest certainty comes from the time of King
          Ahab of Israel, who, influenced by his Phenician wife,
          introduced the Phenician Baal-worship, erecting a Baal-temple in
          Samaria and appointing a numerous priesthood (I Kings xvi,
          31-32; xviii, 19). [814]Elijah (q.v.) vigorously opposed this
          idolatrous cult (I Kings xviii). Jehoram, Ahab's son, put away a
          Baal-column erected by his father (II Kings iii, 2), but did not
          extirpate the cult. Jehu abolished the worship of the Phenician
          god (II Kings x, 21-28). But in the eighth century the prophet
          Hosea speaks of Baal-worship as existing in Israel without
          stating which "Baal" or "Baals" are meant. Of the Baal-cult in
          Judah we know only that it was abolished under the influence of
          Jehoiada, the priest (II Kings xi, 18). Probably under the
          influence of Athaliah, grandmother of Joash and daughter of the
          Phenician Jezebel, Baal-worship had been introduced into Judah
          (cf. II Chron. xxiv, 7); this Baal was no doubt Melkart of Tyre.
          Not much reliance can be placed upon the statement (II Chron.
          xxviii, 2) that Ahaz worshiped the Baals (but cf. II Kings xvi,
          3-4). In the statement (II Kings xxi, 3) that Manasseh reared up
          altars " for Baal" (better " for the Baals" ), Baal may be a
          general term for idol. Whenever Jeremiah speaks of the Baal (ii,
          8; vii, 9; xi, 13; xxii, 29), he generally means " the idol" (so
          also II Kings xvii, 16), which is especially evident from II
          Kings xi, 13 (cf. " the Baals," ii, 23; ix, 14). In Zephaniah,
          too (i, 4), in " the remnant of Baal" the word Baal is
          equivalent to " idolatry." In the time of Jeremiah the
          idolatrous Judeans worshiped the sun, the moon, and the host of
          heaven. All these powers Jeremiah calls " the Baal" or " the
          shameful thing" (Jer. xi, 13). The name Baal was so obnoxious to
          the later scribes that they substituted for it the word bosheth,
          " shame," a word used as early as Jeremiah; and the Alexandrian
          Jews, as Dillmann has shown, read in their Greek text the word
          aischyne instead of Baal, which explains the use of the feminine
          article before Baal (cf. Dillmann, Ueber Baal mit dem weiblichen
          Artikel, in the Monatsberichte der Akademie der Wissenschaften
          zu Berlin, phil.-hist. Klasse, 1881).

    6. Ceremonies of the Baal-worship.

          For the mode of worship in Israel reference can be made only to
          those passages of the Old Testament in which Baal-worship is
          undoubtedly to be understood as the cult of the Phenician god.
          He was worshiped with sacrifices and burnt offerings (II Kings
          x, 24) especially of bullocks (I Kings xviii, 23), and by
          kissing his images (I Kings xix, 18). In the Baal-temple of
          Samaria the pillar of Baal was of stone (II Kings x, 27).
          Usually a Baal was worshiped in conjunction with Astarte (Judges
          ii, 13; x, 6; I Sam. vii, 4; xii, 10). A Baal-altar with an
          Asherah is mentioned in Judges vi, 25. According to II Chron.
          xxxiv, 4, the h?ammanim or sun images stood on or beside the
          altars of Baal. When the statement is made that incense was
          offered upon the roofs to the Baal (Jer. xxxii, 29; cf., on the
          " burning of incense" to the Baal in general, Jer. vii, 9; xi,
          13), not Baal-worship, but worship of the stars is meant (Jer.
          xix, 13; Zeph. i, 5; cf. II Kings xxiii, 12). In the time of
          Ahab there were many priests and prophets (about 450) of Baal
          (II Kings x, 19; I Kings xviii, 19). The prophets worshiped the
          god by leaping around the altar (I Kings xviii, 26) and by
          cutting themselves with knives and lances (verse 28). The
          leaping appears to have been a means of inducing the
          trance-state (verse 29), it may also have been a part of the
          cult. The " vestry" mentioned II Kings x, 22 probably belonged
          to the royal palace, and was not intended for the official robes
          of the priests. See [815]Asherah; [816]Ashtoreth; [817]High

   Baalbek
          BAALBEK, b??l´´bek´: A city of Coele-Syria, celebrated for its
          magnificence in the first centuries of the Christian era, and
          famous ever since for its ruins.

    Location and History.

          It is situated on a plain near the foot of the Anti-Lebanus
          range, about forty miles northwest of Damascus, and 3,800 feet
          above sea-evel. Its earlier name was Baalbek, " City of Baal,"
          changed under the Seleucidæ to Heliopolis. In Egypt there was a
          Heliopolis (also called On; see [818]On), and the plausible
          supposition has been offered that these two places were of
          common origin. In proof, the saying of the author of De dea
          Syria, that in the great temple of Heliopolis an antique idol
          was worshiped which had been brought from Egypt, is quoted, and
          also the statement of Macrobius in his Saturnalia, that the
          statue of Jupiter Heliopolitanus came from Egypt. Supporting
          this is the judgment of C. A. Rich, quoted below, that the
          substructure of the ruins at Baalbek is Egyptian, at least in
          part. It was only after Baalbek was made a Roman colony, under
          the name Colonia Julia Augusta Felix Heliopolitana, that it
          became a place of importance. It can not be identified
          satisfactorily with any Bible locality. It is mentioned by
          Josephus (Ant., XIV, iii, 2), Pliny (Hist. nat., v, 22), and
          Ptolemy; and coins of the city have been found of almost all the
          emperors from Nerva to Gallienus.

    The Ruins.

          Baalbek contains ruins of three temples: of the sun, of Jupiter,
          and a small one of Venus; also of a Christian basilica. The
          first is attributed to Antoninus Pius (138-161) by John Malala
          (c. 52rr 600); only six columns and their entablature and the
          substructure remain. The walls of the temple of Jupiter are
          standing, but the roof is gone. C. A. Rich, who examined the
          ruins in 1894, says (American Architect, xlvii, 1895, pp. 3
          sqq.) that the substructure of the whole, at least in part, is
          Egyptian, while the beveled masonry under the peristyle of the
          temple of the sun is Phenician. The Germans, who have in hand
          the examination of Baalbek, have made out that a great altar,
          thought at first to be cut from the living rock and pieced out
          with masonry, but subsequently discovered to be wholly of
          masonry, is the center of the entire group. This was surrounded
          by a series of walls built up so as to allow the superposition
          of a platform level with the base of the altar, forming the
          floor of the great court. On the east, west, and north sides,
          these walls were employed to make passages and chambers beneath
          the platform. To the east of the platform was a hexagonal court,
          giving access to the great court, while to the west was the
          great temple of the sun. The temple of Jupiter is to the south
          of the west end of the great court, distant about fifty feet
          from the south wall of the latter. Around this court on three
          sides, also around the hexagonal court, was carried a lofty
          peristyle on a stylobate of three steps. Four sides of the
          hexagonal court held chapels, the other two sides being given to
          the entrances to the courts. The north and south sides of the
          great court held each three chapels and two niches, most richly
          elaborated, the east, side having two, one on each side of the
          entrance. On the floor of the great court on the north and the
          south sides of the altar were two large basins, unfinished, two
          and a half feet deep, with walls paneled on the outside, the
          panels decorated with genii and festooned flowers. Clear traces
          of a Christian basilica have been found on the great platform,
          the great altar being the center, while the line of the eastern
          wall of the temple of the sun is conterminous with the west wall
          of the basilica. The floor of the latter was seven and a half
          feet above the court pavement, thus preserving intact the great
          altar, which was built over.

    The Great Stones.

          Of the temple of the sun the two most marked features, long
          known, were the six great columns with their entablature and the
          three megaliths at the west end, two of the latter measuring
          sixty three feet long by thirteen square, and sixty-four feet
          long by fourteen square. Another stone still lies in the. quarry
          near-by cut out from the rock, and measures sixty-nine and a
          quarter feet long by fourteen square. The columns, of which
          there were originally fifty-eight, nineteen at each side and ten
          at each end, were seventy-five feet in height with a diameter of
          seven and a quarter feet, and the entablature was fourteen feet
          in height, These columns supported the roof. The use of the
          megaliths was only recently discovered. It now appears that they
          were carried around the south side of the base of the temple,
          and it is possible that they will be found on the other sides as
          well. It appears that the temple was built on an artificial
          mound of earth, and that the great stones were employed to
          sustain this mass. The order of architecture is the Corinthian,
          with all the elaboration to which that style so easily lends
          itself. The floor area of the temple of the sun was
          approximately 290 feet by 160.

          The temple of Jupiter, also of the Corinthian order, 227 by 117
          feet, was surrounded by a peristyle of forty-two plain columns,
          while ten fluted ones were in the vestibule. The entablature was
          of very profuse and rich ornamentation.

          The whole was reached from the east by a magnificent flight of
          steps no longer standing, 150 feet in breadth. The scope of the
          entire group of structures may be judged from the fact that from
          the east porch of the hexagonal court to the west wall of the
          temple of the sun is 900 feet, while the breadth of the great
          court was 400 feet.

          In connection with recent study of these ruins two interesting
          questions have been answered. On the soffit of the temple of the
          sun, now hidden by the braces sustaining it, is a figure in
          relief of an eagle carrying in his talons a caduceus and in his
          beak a garland, the ends of which are held by two putti. It is
          believed that the eagle represents Jupiter, the caduceus
          Mercury, and the putti represent the evening and morning star,
          i.e., Venus, all of whom received worship at the place. Mr. Rich
          in the article cited shows that great masses like the megaliths
          were moved by a sort of crane, V-shaped, socketed on metal, to
          one end of which was attached a cradle in .which stones were put
          until the mass to be moved was counterbalanced.

   Baasha
          BAASHA, bê´a-sha: Third king of Israel, 952-930 B.C., according
          to the old chronology; 925-901, Duncker; 909-886, Hommel;
          914-891, Kamphausen. He was the son of Ahijah of the tribe of
          Issachar, apparently of a family of little repute, but probably
          rose to be a commander in the army. When Nadab, king of Israel,
          was besieging the Philistine city of Gibbethon, Baasha conspired
          against him, slew him, and then proceeded to establish himself
          on the throne by a massacre of the entire house of Jeroboam. His
          residence was at Tirzah, where he was also buried. He undertook
          to fortify Ramah, on the frontier between Israel and Judah, two
          hours north of Jerusalem, thus menacing the southern kingdom,
          but desisted on hearing that Benhadad of Damascus had invaded
          northern Israel instigated by [819]Asa, king of Judah (q.v.).
          Whether he resisted Benhadad or made terms with him is not
          stated, but the cities which the latter is said to have captured
          were later in Israel's possession (II Kings xv, 29). The
          religious condition of Israel under Baasha remained as under his
          two predecessors. His history is found in I Kings xv, 16-22,
          27-34; xvi, 1-6.

          Aug. 3, 1858; d. in Naples, Italy, May 18, 1901. He was
          graduated at Syracuse University, 1879, and from Auburn
          Theological Seminary, 1882; he became pastor of the First
          Presbyterian Church, Lockport, N. Y., 1882, of the Brown
          Memorial Presbyterian Church, Baltimore, Md., 1887, and of the
          Brick Presbyterian Church, New York, 1900. In the following
          spring he went on an excursion to the Holy Land, on his way back
          contracted Mediterranean fever and died in a hospital in Naples.
          His comparatively brief life made a deep impression because he
          consecrated his remarkable powers and attainments to the public
          service. His sermons were of unusual effect. They were
          unconventional, sincere and fervid, glowed with a spiritual
          light, and held the attention of even the most indifferent. His
          loving heart went out to all whom he met and his single desire
          was to do them good. As pastor and preacher he will long be
          remembered and spoken of in unmeasured terms of praise. In
          Baltimore he was counted one of the first citizens and in New
          York he bade fair to repeat his personal and professional
          triumph. Book-making was not his aim in life and the
          publications which bear his name were posthumous; they are:
          Thoughts for Every Day Living (New York, 1901), a volume of
          selections; Letters from Egypt and Palestine (1902), written to
          the Men's Association in the Brick Church; Three Whys and their
          Answer (1902); Hymns and Carols (1903); and The Success of
          Defeat (1905).

          Mirza Ali Mohammed, the Bab (§ 2).

          Persecution and Death of the Bab (§ 3).

          Doctrines (§ 4).

    1. Antecedents of Babism.

          Babism, the system of a mystic Mohammedan sect, which originated
          in Persia about the middle of the nineteenth century, is said to
          have more than 1,000 000 adherents to-day and is still
          spreading, and offers in its history some striking parallels to
          the origin and early development of Christianity. Mohammedanism
          is a religion sharply defined, even iron-bound in its doctrinal
          precision, dogmatic to the last degree in its essentials; and
          yet it has manifested the greatest elasticity in politics, in
          social life, in philosophy, and in religious beliefs (see
          [822]Mohammed, Mohammedanism). Material and expressed in
          material terms, its theology has nevertheless embraced the
          abstractions of Greek philosophy, Persian mysticism, and Hindu
          pantheism and incarnation among the doctrines held by its
          adherents. Babism and its precursors most completely illustrate
          these anomalies. The roots of the sect lie in the early doctrine
          known as Shiah, which has flourished most prolifically and
          almost solely on Persian soil. The foundation of Shiah teaching
          is the doctrine concerning the Imam. According to this system,
          the Imamate or Califate is not elective nor is it to be usurped;
          it is of divine right and altogether spiritual; Ali, through
          Ayesha's guile thrice defeated for succession to Mohammed and
          finally assassinated, was the first Imam. The essence of the
          Imamate is a light which passed directly from Mohammed to Ali
          and passes from one Imam to the next. By virtue of this light
          the Imam becomes impeccable, omniscient, divine, an incarnation
          of deity. A philosophic ground of this doctrine is that even an
          infallible book like the Koran to be effective requires an
          infallible exponent, which is furnished by the Imamate. But the
          Imamate, though it is a succession, is not unlimited, and of the
          two main branches of Shiites one reckons six and the other
          twelve Imams. Both branches hold the mystical doctrine that the
          last Imam did not die, but lives " concealed" in one of the
          Arabic utopias, Jabulka or Jabulsa. A corollary is that he is to
          reappear, e.g., as the Mahdi " the Guided," who is to " fill the
          earth with justice" --a prophecy and a hope which naturally lead
          to repeated attempts at their fulfilment and realization (see
          [823]Mahdi). It is further held that there were two degrees of "
          concealment" or " occultation," the minor and the major. During
          the former, communication with the faithful was made by
          intermediaries who were called Abwab or " Gates" (singular bab).
          When the last of the Abwab died (1021) without naming a
          successor, the major occultation began in the entire cessation
          of communion between the Imam and the faithful. Naturally the
          Shiites have ever since been expecting the reopening of
          communication with the Imam and a period of enlightenment in his
          revealing.

    2. Mirza Ali Mohammed, the Bab.

          The immediate precursors of the Babis were the Shaikhis,
          followers of Shaikh Ahmad (1753-1826), a Shiite mystic, ascetic,
          and thinker. His special teaching was that the Imams were
          personifications of divine attributes and that of these
          personifications Ali was chief. He gathered around him a great
          company of believers, the leadership of whom passed after his
          death to Hajji Sayyid Kazim, still a young man, but reserved,
          mysterious, and ascetic to a degree, under whom the sect
          multiplied in numbers and came to include many of the nobility.
          Just before his death (1843) Sayyid Kazim forbade his followers
          to mourn and declared that it was good that he should go in
          order that " the true one should appear." He died without
          appointing a successor. Among his disciples had been a certain
          Mirza Ali Mohammed, a native of Shiraz, who was only
          twenty-three years of age when Sayyid Kazim died. Mirza Ali was
          met by Mullah Husain, one of the searchers for a successor to
          the dead leader, and claimed to be the sought one, the " true
          one who was to appear" and the Bab or " Gate." He also claimed
          inspiration, established his right to the place of leader by
          revealing undiscovered meanings in the Koran, and convinced the
          searchers that their quest was ended. This claim was the more
          easily allowed because the year in which it was made was
          reckoned as the one thousandth from that of the disappearance of
          the last Imam. Millenarianism of a certain kind is as potent in
          its influence over Mohammedans as it was in Christendom in the
          year 1000 of the Christian era. Adherents came in by the hundred
          when the news that the Bab had appeared was spread abroad, as it
          soon was in the manner peculiar to the East. To the personal
          attractiveness of the young leader and the agreement of his
          pantheistic teachings with the mysticism held by most Shiites
          there was added as a compelling force driving to association,
          with his following the great evils of a tyrannous civil and
          religious administration, so that the Babis soon became a large
          and important body.

    3. Persecution and Death of the Bab.

          The next year (1843) the Bab made the pilgrimage to Mecca,
          returning confirmed in his opposition to the mullahs or clergy.
          He attacked them in his preaching, and when they sent their
          ablest debaters to confute him and his claims, these partizans
          were either silenced or convinced. They then secured his arrest
          and attempted to assassinate him, but were prevented since he
          was under the protection of the governor. When the latter died
          (1847), Mirza Ali was thrown into prison in Maku and finally
          taken to Tabriz, where his confinement was daily made more
          rigorous. All the time he was exceedingly prolific in a literary
          way, claiming indeed as evidence of his inspiration the ability
          to produce 1,000 lines of poetry a day. His mildness and
          gentleness won the hearts even of his jailers, and converts were
          increased as accounts of his sufferings were made public. The
          most notable conversion was that of a famous, learned, and very
          beautiful woman to whom the Bab gave the name Jenab-i-Tahira, "
          Her Excellency the Pure." She was permeated with mysticism, and
          by her devotion and persuasiveness during her life and still
          more by her martyrdom (1852), she gained large numbers as
          adherents of the faith. Meanwhile in 1848 the late Shah was
          crowned, and selected as his prime minister a violent opponent
          of Babism. Under the persecution immediately instituted, some of
          the Babis seized arms and proclaimed the Bab sovereign, a
          proceeding which he discountenanced. The prime minister then had
          the Bab executed, July 8, 1850, expecting that his death would
          cause the dissolution of the sect. But Mirza Ali had nominated
          Mirza Yahya his successor and head of the nineteen councilors,
          and continuity was secured. On assuming leadership, the latter
          took the names of Sub-i-Ezel and Hazrat-i-Ezel, " Dawn and
          Holiness of Eternity."

          The execution of the Bab exasperated his followers, and some of
          them attempted to assassinate the Shah. This involved the sect
          in new persecutions and in wholesale executions in public in
          which the most execrable atrocities were perpetrated (Count
          Gobineau has described some of the scenes in Les Religions et
          les philosophies, pp. 301-303, quoted in Renan, Les Apôtres, p.
          378, Eng. transl., p. 201). As a result there was a great exodus
          of the adherents of the sect to Bagdad, whence, upon Persian
          official protest against their continued residence so near to
          the Persian territory, the Turkish government removed them to
          Adrianople. The leader secluded himself very persistently,
          conducting affairs through his half-brother Beha. The latter
          suddenly proclaimed himself the one foretold by the Bab as " the
          one whom God shall manifest," drew after himself most of the
          following, and split the sect into the " Ezelites" and the "
          Behaites." Between the two parties hostilities so bitter broke
          out that the Turks sent Beha to Acre, which became the
          headquarters of the Behaites and the center of their propaganda.
          Ezel was removed to Cyprus, and his following has become almost
          extinct. Beha was almost as prolific a writer as the Bab, and
          his works are extant in a Bombay edition. He died in 1892, and
          his son Abbas Effendi took his place and is the present leader.
          The number of Babis is estimated at over 1,000,000, and they
          carry on a propaganda in the United States (described in AJT,
          Jan., 1902). See [824]Behaism.

    4. Doctrines.

          The doctrines of the Babis rest on two bases: (1) The general
          system of Shiah in its pantheistic and mystical phases; and (2)
          the assumption that no revelation is final, but represents only
          the measure of truth the stage of human progress has rendered
          man capable of receiving. Hence, as the revelation of Moses was
          superseded by that of Jesus, and his by Mohammed's, and his in
          turn by the Bab's, so the latter's is superseded by Beha's. But
          Abbas Effendi has tried to throw a log under the car of progress
          by declaring that " whoever lays claim to a revelation before
          1,000 full years have passed is a lying impostor." The explicit
          teachings are (1) the veneration of the Imams; (2) the fact of
          their concealment and the doctrine of intermediaries; (3) the
          reappearance of the Imam as a reincarnation; (4) the
          non-finality of any revelation; (5) the incarnation of deity as
          an avatar from time to time to give instruction (Adam, Noah,
          Abraham, Moses, David, Jesus, Mohammed, and the Bab were such
          avatars, alike rejected by their hearers); (6) the possibility
          of an achievement, like that of the Buddhist Nirvana, of unity
          of the individual with True Being; (7) the fact of a final
          judgment; (8) the system of numbers based on nineteen: the year
          consists of nineteen months, of nineteen days, of nineteen
          hours, of nineteen minutes; the Bab had eighteen associates, he
          making the nineteenth and being the point of unity; the square
          of nineteen is the symbol of the universe; the Bab and his
          disciples represent God and, each of these having nineteen under
          him, make up the square which represents perfection. Commended
          for practise by the Babis are: abolition of religious warfare,
          friendly intercourse with all sects and people, obedience to the
          ruler, submission to law, confession of sin to God, acquisition
          of all knowledge which contributes to human good, and mastery of
          some trade or profession. Prayer is three times (not five times)
          a day, and the believer turns his face toward Acre, not toward
          Mecca. The Babi fast is not the month of Ramadhan, but the last
          month of the Babi year and lasts nineteen days. There is evident
          in all this a determination to mark the separation of the sect
          from Mohammedanism.

          The Bab's dictum on worship is worthy of quotation: " So worship
          God that if the recompense of thy worship of him were to be the
          fire, no alteration of thy worship would be produced. If you
          worship from fear, that is unworthy of the threshold of the
          holiness of God, nor will you be accounted a believer; so also,
          if your gaze is on Paradise and you worship in hope of that, for
          then you have made God's creation a partner with him."

          Babylonia designates the country extending from the head of the
          Persian Gulf to about 34â° north latitude (approximately the
          latitude of Beirut; c. 75 m. n. of Bagdad) and lying between the
          rivers Tigris and Euphrates or immediately adjacent to them.

  I. The Names. Importance of Babylonia

          Babylonia was the Greek name for the country, derived from the
          name of the capital city Babylon, this last also a Grecized form
          from the Semitic Bab-ilu, Heb. Babel, " Gate of God." By the
          earliest inhabitants known the whole land was called Edin, " the
          Plain." In Gen. x, 10 the name given it is Shinar, the
          derivation of which is in dispute. The most probable origin is
          from Sungir, a variant reading of Girsu. The g in Sungir
          represents the Semitic ghayin which could be represented in
          Hebrew only by ayin; the word would then be transliterated Snr
          and could be pronounced Shinar. The land was known to the
          Hebrews also as Erez? Kasdim, "Land of the Kasdim," the second
          word a variation for Kaldu, Hebraized Kaldim. From this last
          came the Greek form Chaldea. The Kaldu were the race which
          controlled the country about 610-538 B.C. A name used by the
          early inhabitants now called Sumerians or Akkadians was
          Kengi-Uri, Semitized by Sargon and others into Sumer-u-Akkad,
          "Sumer and Akkad." Another name, derived from a Kasshite source
          and appearing in the Amarna Tablets, is Karduniyash.

    1. Reasons for Interest.

          The reasons for the great interest in Babylonia are twofold,
          cultural and Biblical. In that country have been revealed the
          certain traces of the earliest advanced civilization yet
          discovered as well as that which had the longest continuous
          existence. The highest estimates place the beginnings of this
          civilization between 8000 and 10000 B.C.; at a moderate
          reckoning it seems that evidences of culture are in sight dating
          from 5000 B.C. The Biblical interest centers about two facts:
          first, that in Genesis the origin of Abraham is traced to Ur,
          one of the oldest cities in Babylonia; and, second, the fact
          that Babylonia was the land of Israel's exile and became to
          Israel a second home, where many Israelites settled permanently.
          But there is a third reason for interest. One of the lessons a
          comparative study of history teaches is that Babylonia
          represents a principle very different from that which underlies
          Assyrian history. Assyria stood for Semitic materialism, for
          fighting ability, and conquest by force of arms. Babylonia, on
          the other hand, represented culture, civilization, literature,
          and the all-controlling power of religion. Its force in this
          respect is notable especially for the way in which its
          civilization subdued even its conquerors. Its Elamitic,
          Kasshite, and even Assyrian masters came under the sway of its
          religious moods and its literary methods. Kasshite and Chaldean
          kings forgot to write of their wars and transmitted almost
          solely the accounts of the erection and adornment of temples and
          the making of canals.

  II. The Land.

    1. Alluvial.

          Geologically, Babylonia is almost wholly alluvial. The
          thirty-fourth parallel of latitude cuts across the line of
          demarcation between the limestone and the alluvium, leaving in
          the northeast a slight stretch of the latter to the north of the
          parallel, and on the southwest a little region of limestone east
          of the Euphrates to the south. The alluvium on the west is
          nearly conterminous with the Euphrates, except in the extreme
          south; to the east the soil made by the rivers stretches to the
          foothills of the Persian mountains. Its narrowest part is where
          the rivers make their nearest approach to each other; from that
          point northward the alluvium is only between the rivers, while
          below it immediately widens beyond the Tigris eastward and
          thence to the Persian Gulf maintains its width. The account just
          given involves the statement that in prehistoric times the
          Persian Gulf stretched north to a point just beyond the
          thirty-fourth parallel, and that before the deposit of the
          rivers, its waters have receded a distance of 425 miles. The
          rate of this deposit is known for a part of this period. The
          town known as Spasinus Charax in the time of Alexander the Great
          was then one mile from the Gulf. In 1835 Mohammera, recognized
          as the site of the town just mentioned, was forty-seven miles
          away. Thus forty-six miles of land had been made in 2,160 years,
          or at the rate of over 110 feet a year. It is interesting that
          this ascertained rate, supposing it to have been uniform during
          the historic period, corroborates the chronology gained from
          other sources.

    2. Influence on Life and Activities.

          To the character of the land as alluvium, to its subtropical
          position, and to the elaborate system of irrigation and careful
          agriculture, and the abundant moisture, was due its wonderful
          fertility, second only, if it were second, to that of the Nile
          valley. To these characteristics were due many important
          consequences, notable among them the structure and material of
          the buildings and the kind of governmental and popular
          activities. It was inevitable that an alluvial land, inundated
          by two rivers, the periods of overflow of which were not quite
          synchronous but in part successive (see [825]Assyria), should
          abound in marshes; and that to relieve this condition,
          distribute the waters, and drain the land, canals, and many of
          them, should be constructed. And the extent of country thus to
          be redeemed being large, the making of canals became a
          governmental function. Again, an alluvial district provides
          neither stone nor wood for building. The clay of the land must
          therefore be utilized as building material; and it is almost
          inevitable that most of the bricks be sun-dried, since fuel for
          burning them is scarce and expensive. Once more, it is evident
          that since the inundations were annual, some method of putting
          human habitations beyond the reach of the waters would be
          required, and it is found that the cities were built upon
          platforms of bricks. Thus Babylonia became a land of mounds and
          of canals, the construction of the latter being one of the chief
          activities of the rulers. The "rivers of Babylon" were a feature
          of the landscape, and the mounds are abundantly in evidence.

          Of the fertility varying accounts have been transmitted.
          Herodotus (i, 193) gives the increase of cereals as 200 to 300
          fold; Theophrastus (Hist. plantarum, viii, 7) as fifty to 100;
          Strabo (xvi) as by report 300 fold; and Pliny as 150 fold.
          Herodotus was notoriously credulous, Strabo and Pliny got their
          reports at second hand. The statement of Theophrastus is not
          beyond belief.

    3. The Climate, Fauna, and Flora.

          Knowledge of early climatic conditions is in part a matter of
          observation in modern times under conditions which differ
          greatly from earlier conditions, and in part of inference from
          known effects. The temperature reported by the excavators runs
          in June and July as high as 120â° F. in the shade. And this heat
          is made more oppressive by the hot winds brought by the
          sandstorms of the desert. That the conditions were not so severe
          during the palmy days of Babylonia is almost certain, since the
          abundant canals of flowing water must have reduced the
          temperature and so have modified the atmospheric depressions
          caused by rarefaction. The fauna and flora differed little from
          those of [826]Assyria (q.v.). Of grains, wheat, barley, millet,
          sesamum, oats, and perhaps rice, were grown; wheat and barley
          were probably indigenous. The gourd family was abundant,
          leguminous plants were in great variety, and the leeks numerous.
          Of trees the apple, fig, apricot, pistachio, almond, walnut,
          cypress, tamarisk, plane, acacia, and above all the palm, were
          cultivated. The waters abounded in fish, the carp being
          especially plentiful. The water fowl were naturally the most
          numerous, the swan, goose, duck, pelican, crane, stork, heron,
          and gull being known. Of land birds the ostrich, bustard,
          partridge, quail, pigeon, turtle-dove, and ortalon are still
          found. Birds of prey are the hawk and the eagle.

  III. Exploration and Excavation.

          Antiquarian interest in Babylonia had always been greater than
          in Assyria, perhaps because the region had oftener been visited
          and described. Bricks with inscriptions had been seen and sent
          to England by the East India Company's agents at Bassorah;
          these, however, were not the result of excavation but of
          purchase or of superficial search of the mounds. They served,
          none the less, to awaken and maintain interest in the country.
          For the background of Babylonian excavation see [827]Assyria,
          III.

    1. Rich and Mignan.

          The first excavator in Babylon was Claudius James Rich, who in
          Dec., 1811, visited Babil, had some Arabs dig at the top of the
          mound, found layers of inscribed bricks, and purchased others
          from the natives, which when sent home proved to carry writing
          of the same general character as that of the Persepolitan
          inscriptions. In 1826-28 Capt. Robert Mignan was attached to the
          East India Company's station at Bassorah, in command of the
          military escort. He was interested in exploratory work and
          particularly in the region between Bagdad and Bassorah. In his
          travels in the district he made some small researches, as for
          instance at Kassr, where he put thirty men at work, found a
          platform of inscribed bricks, a number of seal cylinders, and a
          barrel cylinder, the first ever found by a European, and some
          remains of the Greek age.

    2. Loftus.

          Attached as geologist to the Turko-Persian Frontier Commission
          (1850-54) was William Kennett Loftus. In the course of a ride
          from Bagdad to Mohammera he had picked up or bought a number of
          small antiquities, and proposed to excavate for more at Warka.
          Permission from his commanding officer was obtained, and in 1850
          Loftus set to work. A number of " slippered" coffins were
          secured whole, and by the ingenious device of pasting thick
          layers of paper inside and out three were kept intact and sent
          to the British Museum. In 1854 Loftus excavated a number of
          buildings, recovered many inscribed bricks but no works of art,
          in which he was most interested. The finds of Botta at Nineveh
          (see [828]Assyria, III, 3) seemed so great in comparison with
          his own that he became discouraged even with his success in
          finding mortuary remains, tablets and vases, and a considerable
          number of contract tablets of different periods. He removed his
          operations to Senkereh, discovered there the temple of Shamash,
          found bricks that brought Hammurabi into light and recovered the
          records of King Ur-gur (2700 B.C.) and other objects relating to
          the period between him and Nabonidus (539 B.C.). Work at other
          mounds, as at Tell-Sifr, was productive of inscriptions dated
          under the first dynasty of Babylon, and of utensils of copper
          belonging to the third pre-Christian millennium. During this
          same period Layard and Rassam made an essay at Tell-Mohammed
          near Bagdad, but found little of interest and importance.
          Excavations at Babil, Kassr, and elsewhere were also resultless.
          At Niffar little besides the slipper coffins rewarded the
          workers, and Layard was led to abandon as unpromising the site
          from which half a century later the great finds of the
          expedition of the University of Pennsylvania were recovered.

    3. Fresnel and Oppert.

          The French expedition under Fulgence Fresnel and Jules Oppert
          began work at Kassr, Tell-Amran, and elsewhere near Babylon in
          1852. There were considerable results from the gleanings of the
          next three years, the most valuable being the marble vase of
          Naram-Sin. Unfortunately the whole was lost in the Tigris with
          the finds which had come from Assyria. Under the direction of
          Rawlinson, the British vice-consul at Bassorah undertook work at
          Mugheir. It was speedily determined that the temple there, which
          had never wholly collapsed, belonged to the moon-god Sin, which
          comprised the results of building operations from the time of
          Ur-gur (2700 B.C.) to that of Nabonidus, and the inscriptions of
          the latter recording his work of restoration were found.
          Sufficient was unearthed to carry the history of the place as
          far back as 4000 B.C., but the site still awaits systematic
          excavation. Abu-Shahrein was examined and found to be unique in
          the quantity of stone used on the great structures, and
          evidences were also discovered which implied pre-Sargonic date.
          It is a promising site for future work. At Birs Nimrud
          examination of the ruins was undertaken, and the experience of
          Rawlinson enabled him to point out the exact place where
          cylinders would be found (which proved to be those of
          Nebuchadrezzar), in the corners of the temple of Nebo.

    4. De Sarzec.

          For about twenty years systematic operations were suspended
          while scholars at home were examining the material accumulated.
          Meanwhile Ernest de Sarzec had been appointed vice-consul for
          the French at Bassorah. He secured the good-will of Nasir Pasha,
          then the real ruler of the district, and began a series of
          campaigns at Telloh which covered the period between 1877 and
          1900, the year before his death. The net results of the work
          there were the discovery of Gudea's bricks and of the temple
          which he built; nine diorite statues in the highest form of
          Babylonian art yet discovered, headless indeed, but inscribed;
          two cylinders with the longest inscriptions in Sumerian yet
          discovered; and, in 1894, a treasure of 30,000 tablets,
          thousands of which were stolen by the Arabs because De Sarzec
          was unable to care for them. The temple of Nin-Girsu or Ninib,
          god of Lagash, was uncovered, also the celebrated stele of
          vultures which represents the birds carrying away from Gishku
          parts of the bodies of the slain enemies of King Eannatum, art
          objects of the highest finish in the shape of round trays of
          onyx, the silver vase of Entenema, beautifully chased, and
          votive statues. The tablets recovered were mainly commercial and
          administrative, the series running from c. 4000 B.C. to about
          2550 B.C. The additional fact was developed that by 4000 B.C.
          the writing had already passed beyond the stage of
          picture-writing.

    5. Rassam.

          Between 1878 and 1882 Raasam conducted excavations for the
          English at Borsippa and in the region of Babylon, and among the
          tablets unearthed were those of the Egidi firm of bankers. Over
          60,000 were discovered, but unfortunately most of them were
          ruined by moisture. In general they were of a business
          character, though a number were literary, mythological, and
          religious, and one was the cylinder of Cyrus describing his
          conquest of the city of Babylon. Sippar was identified with
          Abu-Habba, where the celebrated tablet of the sun-god was
          recovered; in this place alone Rasaam uncovered 130 chambers.
          The result of German excavations at Surghul and El-Habba in 1887
          was a large collection of mortuary remains and more exact
          knowledge of methods of disposing of the dead.

    6. The University of Pennsylvania Expedition.

          The next noteworthy attempt at excavation was made by an
          American expedition sent out by the University of Pennsylvania
          (see below, [829]IV, 9). In 1884 an association of scholars in
          America was formed to forward research in Babylonia, and the
          same year the Wolfe expedition under Dr. Ward, Mr. Haynes, and
          Dr. Sterrett sailed to make a preliminary survey and recommend a
          site for systematic excavation. Niffar was chosen, and there,
          beginning in 1888, the most systematic work has been done and
          consequently permanently valuable results have been there
          obtained. Aside from the recovery of over 50,000 tablets and art
          objects of various sorts, perhaps the most significant
          consequence is the approximate determination of the period of
          occupation of the site, which was accomplished by means of the
          depth of the debris. The Parthian fortress was seventeen to
          nineteen feet above the pavement of Naram-Sin, and the interval
          between the early ruler and the Parthians was about 3,500 years.
          From the pavement to the virgin soil was about thirty feet, for
          twenty five of which continuous evidences of human activity were
          found in the shape of constructive works, urns, and seal
          impressions. A low estimate would place the city's beginnings
          then as early as 6000 B.C.

          A German expedition has been working since 1899 on the mounds
          which cover the old city of Babylon and has identified Kassr
          with Nebuchadrezzar's palace, and Tell-Amran with E-sagila.

  IV. The Cities.

    1. Origin and Development.

          Two facts differentiate Babylonian from Assyrian cities. (1) The
          former received character rather from their temples than from
          their palaces, from their religion than their temporalities. (2)
          They were not arbitrary creations like most of the Assyrian
          cities. Investigations at Nippur and careful examination of the
          evidence (as by C. S. Fisher, Babylonian Expedition of the
          University of Pennsylvania, part 1, Philadelphia, 1905) proves
          that the location of the centers of life, culture, and worship
          were the results of the usual play of natural circumstances.
          With the plain subject to periodical inundations, the highest
          spots were occupied by the earliest inhabitants, reed huts were
          built, and a shrine was erected. The character of the materials
          used invited frequent conflagrations with loss of life, which
          explains the beds of ashes next to virgin soil and the human
          remains found wherever excavation is carried far enough. With
          increase of population came systematic effort to escape the
          inundations by elevating the original mound, further elevation
          through the decay of the structures, which was hastened by the
          character of the materials used as the people advanced to the
          use of sun-dried and burned bricks, and finally the governmental
          erection of platforms on which the larger cities were built.

          It is necessary for even an elementary appreciation of the
          history of Babylonia, to recognize the early existence of two
          groups of cities, one in the south in the district represented
          by the general name of Sumer, and one in the north covered by
          the term Akkad. Midway between was the city of Nippur. At the
          opening of history strife between the north and the south is in
          evidence. Whether this was due to the incoming of Semites at
          that early age is not yet certain, though the possibilities are
          that way. A difference in the language is evident in that early
          time, and they of the south claimed the purer speech. The cities
          of the south were Eridu, Ur, Erech, Girsu, Larsa, Shirpurla, and
          Lagash, and, much later, in the extreme south, Bit-Yakin. North
          of Nippur were Kish, Cutha, Agade, Sippar, and in later days
          Babylon and Borsippa. Of these, Eridu, Ur, Erech, Larsa, Nippur,
          and Sippar retained their eminence almost throughout history
          because of the celebrity of the shrines and of their deities.
          Shirpurla, Girsu, Isin, Kish, and Agade dropped out of sight in
          the later period; Babylon achieved its predominance in the
          middle period and maintained it to the end.

    2. Eridu.

          Eridu, Sumerian Eri-dugga, " Holy City," the modern
          Abu-Shahrain, " Father of two Mouths," was the southernmost city
          of early Babylonia, situated then on the Persian Gulf, now 130
          miles inland. This fact, on the basis of the data given for the
          rate of deposition of silt by the rivers in the historical
          period, indicates an antiquity of close to 6000 B.C. That the
          ruins contain the remains of the famous temple E-sagil is
          certain, since the city was the home of the god Ea, who was said
          to come each day out of the sea to teach its inhabitants the
          useful arts. This deity remained in the pantheon till the last.
          Among the reasons for the interest in this site is the fact that
          it was never, so far as known, a political center. It was the
          home of the Adapa legend, the fisherman myth found in the Amarna
          tablets (cf. Boscawen, First of Empires, London, 1903, pp.
          69-77). See below [830]VII, 2, § 3, [831]3, § 3.

    3. Ur.

          Ur, Sumerian Uru or Urima, the modern Mugheir (30 m.n.e. of
          Eridu), is on the right bank of the Euphrates. The ruins form a
          rude oval 1,000 yards by 800. Its position made it probably the
          greatest mart of those early times. It was located (1) on the
          river, easy therefore of access from the Gulf and from the
          entire north; (2) at the entrance of a wadi which leads straight
          into the heart of Arabia and marks the caravan route; (3) at the
          starting-point of the road across the desert to Egypt and
          Africa, a route early provided with wells; (4) just a little
          below where the Shatt-al-Kahr, the continuation of the
          Shatt-al-Nil, entered the Euphrates, thus giving access to
          central Babylonia; (5) a little above the Shatt-al-Hai, which
          gave it a waterway to the Tigris. Besides these great advantages
          as a commercial site, Ur was the locus of a pilgrim shrine. It
          was also at times the center of political movements, and gave
          several dynasties to the land. As the home of Sin, with his
          celebrated temple E-gishshirgal, "House of Great Light," and as
          the home of the goddess Nin-gal, its religious significance was
          hardly less than its commercial importance.

    4. Larsa.

          Larsa, the Ellasar of Gen. xiv, the modern Senkereh, was
          situated 15 miles e. of Erech, probably on the Shatt-al-Nil. It
          was a home of the sun-god whose temple took its Semitic name,
          Bit-Shamash, Sumerian E-babar, "House of Light," from the god
          himself. This temple, built or restored by Ur-gur and Dungi, was
          restored by other kings at frequent intervals. Not much is known
          of the city except that it was the head of a small state and was
          the last city to submit to Hammurabi when he unified the
          country, c. 2250 B.C.

    5. Erech.

          Erech, Sumerian Unu or Unug, "Seat," Semitic Uruk or Arku, the
          modern Warka and the Greek Orchoe, probably the home of the
          Archevites of Ezra iv, 9, was situated between the Shatt-al-Nil
          and the Euphrates, 30 miles n. of Ur. The ruins are about six
          miles in circumference, indicating a large population. Erech was
          Sumerian in origin, one of the most sacred of Babylonian cities
          from early times, and continued to stand high in the esteem of
          the people. The two goddesses, Ishtar and Nana or Nina or
          Anunit, had their seat there in the two temples E-ulmash, "House
          of the Oracle," and E-Ana, "House of Heaven." Besides the two
          temples Erech had the seven-staged ziggurat E-zipar-imina. It
          was a walled city, intersected by canals, and has yielded to the
          spade of the excavator evidences of the activities of early
          kings of the Ur dynasty, Dungi and Ur-Bau. It was a seat of
          learning also, the source of part of the library of
          Asshurbanipal, the locus of the Gilgamesh epic and of a creation
          story, the place of abode of the wailing priestesses of Ishtar
          who celebrated the Ishtar-Tammuz episode. It was therefore rich
          in those possessions which were dearest to the Babylonians.
          Later it fell into decay and was used as a necropolis.

    6. Shirpurla and Lagash.

          Shirpurla, the modern Telloh, was situated east of Erech. In the
          opinion of modern scholars it was originally two cities,
          Shirpurla and Lagash. It was the home of two celebrated kings,
          Ur-Bau and Gudea. The fish-goddess Nina had a home there, and
          the temple of Nin-sungir was also located in the place. It may
          have been the Babylonian Nineveh. Its inscriptions are wholly in
          Sumerian, and the ceremonies at the founding of temples are best
          known from discoveries made at this city.

    7. Isin or Nisin.

          Isin or Nisin is one of the lost cities, its site not yet having
          been recovered or at least identified. It was in all probability
          a little north of the middle of the line joining Erech and
          Shirpurla. It contained the ziggurat-temple E-kharsagkalama,
          "Mountain of the World," belonging to Ishtar-Nina.

    8. Girsu.

          Girsu is another of the lost cities; possibly the modern Tell-Id
          covers it. At any rate its location is sought a few miles
          northeast of Erech. It was very early a seat of government but
          was soon dwarfed by its more prosperous neighbors, abandoned,
          and then lost to sight.

    9. Nippur.

          Nippur, the modern Niffar (35 m. s.e. of Babylon), revered in
          ancient times as the home of En-lil, the earliest Bel of
          Babylonia, and the locus of his great temple E-kur, "Mountain
          House," was on the Shatt-al-Nil which ran through the city. It
          is the site of the epoch-making excavations of the University of
          Pennsylvania through which more of light on early conditions has
          come than from any other single source. It contained the chief
          sanctuary of the land in the early and middle period, and its
          possession was always coveted by the rulers because of the
          prestige which accrued, but its prestige was purely religious.
          Kings of the north and of the south and of united Babylonia vied
          in doing honor to its god, placing there votive offerings to
          Bel. Even after Babylon had attained its predominance and Marduk
          had seized the position and attached the name of Bel, the
          Sumerian En-lil still received his meed of worship. The
          topography of Nippur has been investigated by the help of a
          native map dated about 3000 B.C. found on the site (cf. C. S.
          Fisher, Babylonian Expedition of the University of Pennsylvania,
          part 1, Philadelphia, 1905). Ur, Erech, and Nippur remained for
          millenniums the triad of most holy cities of the land.

    10. Kish and Cutha.

          North of Babylon and Borsippa are Kish and Cutha, a few miles
          apart and related to each other as were Borsippa and Babylon.
          Cutha is represented by the modern Tell-Ibrahim (15 m. s.e. from
          Sippar and the same distance n.e. from Babylon). It was the seat
          of the god Nergal and the site of his temple E-shidlam, "House
          of Shadow." Its neighbor Kish, possibly the modern Al-Ohaimer,
          appears in the records belonging to the very dawn of history.
          Not improbably, it was one of the early seats of the Semitic
          settlers. Its king Lugalzaggisi in the fifth pre-Christian
          millennium claimed dominion from the "Lower Sea" (Persian Gulf)
          to the "Upper Sea" (Mediterranean or Lake Van?), and it was
          again prominent in the time of Hammurabi, who had a palace
          there, and built the ziggurat called E-mitiursag, "House of
          Warrior's Adornment."

    11. Akkad and Sippar.

          Akkad and Sippar must also be treated together, for it is
          believed that they were not two but one. Akkad, Sumerian Agade,
          was the city of Sargon I and the capital in his time of the
          region of Akkad (the Sumerian Uri), and is mentioned Gen. x, 1.
          Sippar was almost certainly a dual city, located at the modern
          Abu-Habba. The Hebrew dual form Sepharvaim has by some been
          referred to this city. The displacement of Ishtar of Akkad by
          Anunit goes well with the hypothesis of the oneness of Akkad and
          Sippar, and equally concordant is the long continuance in
          importance of Sippar and the utter loss of Akkad as a city.
          Akkad had no great claims to importance outside of its eminence
          politically under Sargon; and its political eminence was utterly
          lost when Babylon assumed the leadership in Babylonia. On the
          other hand, Sippar always had claims to importance on account of
          its deity Shamash, and this importance would easily permit it to
          assimilate and absorb its less important neighbor. Thus Sippar
          lived on, its temple of Shamash, E-barra, "House of Brilliance,"
          and its temple of Anunit, E-ulbar, securing its fame.

    12. Babylon.

          Babylon bore also the name Tin-tir, "Seat of Life." In Gen. x,
          10 it is named as one of the four cities of Shinar. The
          description which has been current in Christendom goes back to
          the narrative of Herodotus (i, 178-179; transl. in Rogers,
          History of Babylonia and Assyria, i, 389-391, where is given
          also the India House inscription of Nebuchadrezzar describing
          the defenses he added to the city). According to Herodotus,
          Babylon was a great square fifty-four miles in circuit, enclosed
          by a moat of running water and by a rampart 300 feet in height
          and seventy-five broad. Ctesias gives only forty-one miles for
          the circuit. The mounds called by modern Arabs Jumjuna, Amran,
          Kassr, and Babil are recognized as covering parts of the old
          city. The origin of Babylon as a city is unknown, as it does not
          appear in history till just before the time of Hammurabi, 2250
          B.C., and it then figures as his capital. The prowess of that
          king elevated it to the supreme political position, which it
          maintained till Persian times. From Hammurabi's days "king of
          Babylon" was one of the proudest titles of the monarchs of
          Western Asia. Though destroyed by Sennacherib Babylon was
          restored by Esarhaddon in a style of still greater magnificence,
          but it was Nebuchadrezzar who elevated it to its pinnacle of
          greatness. It was he who completed its two great walls, the
          outer Nimitti-Bel, "Dwelling of Bel," and its inner, Imgur-Bel,
          "Bel is Gracious," and dug the moat of which Herodotus tells. He
          finished the two great streets, which he elevated and paved. The
          walls enclosed spaces not occupied by dwellings, asserted to be
          large enough to raise crops ample to support the inhabitants
          during a siege, making Babylon, with its great external
          defenses, impregnable against a foe on the outside. Its great
          temple for Marduk, E-sagila, "House of the Lofty Head," and its
          ziggurat E-temenanaki, seven stages in height, are described by
          the proud builder and beautifier of them. The temple was a
          compound of sanctuaries, the principal one, of course, Bel's,
          containing the splendid statue by taking the hands of which year
          by year the kings of Babylon confirmed their right to the title.
          Nebuchadrezzar's palace was also there, built new from the
          foundations. Hardly less famous than walls and temples and
          palace were the great gateways, closed by massive bronze-covered
          doors guarded by huge colossi. And another temple or ziggurat,
          E-kur, "Mountain House" was also located in the city. This king
          might well have exclaimed: "Is not this great Babylon which I
          have built for the royal dwelling-place, by the might of my
          power and for the glory of my majesty?" (Dan. iv, 30; cf. D. W.
          McGee, Zur Topographie Babylons auf Grund der Urkunden
          Nabopolassars und Nebukadnezars, in Beiträge zur Assyriologie,
          iii, 524-560.)

    13. Borsippa.

          Borsippa, the modern Bira Nimrud, is of importance only as the
          suburb of Babylon and the home of Nebo, the prophet-god of the
          country. There are some signs that its origin antedated that of
          Babylon, as for instance the fact that on his yearly visit to
          Marduk Nebo was accompanied by Marduk part way on the return
          journey, and this is interpreted as an indication of a former
          precedence which was abolished when Marduk became supreme. This
          is corroborated by the relationship assigned to Nebo as the son
          of Marduk, a fiction of late date. The famous temple of the
          place was named E-zida, "Established House," sacred to Nebo. The
          temple of the Seven Spheres of Heaven and Earth was also located
          there.

    14. Bit-Yakin.

          Bit-Yakin was a city in the extreme south, the capital of the
          Kaldu before they became masters of Babylonia. It had been the
          home of Merodach-Baladan, and belonged to the kingdom of the Sea
          Lands.

  V. The People, Language, and Culture.

    1. The Earliest Inhabitants Mongolian.

          Careful discrimination with respect to periods must be made in
          describing the population. The fertility and the wealth and
          culture existent in the country made it the natural focus of
          efforts at subjugation. Different races came in and settled in
          the land, but the old population was able to assimilate the new
          elements which made the region their home. The Babylonians of
          later periods were consequently a people of very mixed origin.
          The earliest inhabitants were a non-Semitic race, almost
          certainly Mongolian, using an agglutinative language which
          differed in its vocabulary, its root forms, and its grammar from
          the Semitic type (see below, [832]§§ 3-5). This earliest
          population, dating back to the beginning of the fifth
          pre-Christian millennium, is shown by statues from Telloh now in
          the Louvre to have been short of stature and thick set,
          brachycephalic, with high cheek bones, flat face, broad nose,
          and almond-shaped eyes, and to have been either beardless or to
          have had the head and face shaven. Other statues of the same
          period seem to represent a mixed race with the characteristics
          just noted somewhat toned down. With these is to be contrasted
          the type shown in later reliefs and statues, a dolycephalic
          race, typically slender, with aquiline features, and hair and
          beard that were long and wavy.

    2. Semitic Immigrations.

          Upon the earlier Sumerians, as the Mongolic people is named,
          before 4000 B.C., came in the Semites as conquerors of part of
          the land, which after some hundreds of years was wholly under
          their control. Thus a second element was added to the
          population. Somewhere about 2500 B.C. a second Semitic
          immigration reenforced the first and marked the completeness of
          Semitic domination. Elamites and Kasshites, both probably
          predominantly Mongolian, and then Semites again followed each
          other at intervals. Still another Semitic addition to the
          population is to be added in the conquest by the Kaldu; while
          the Assyrian and Chaldean periods added other elements in the
          colonists forcibly introduced from subjected countries. In the
          Chaldean period, therefore, the population had become
          exceedingly heterogeneous in respect to origin.

    3. The Language. Two Forms.

          Modern knowledge of the tongues of Babylonia has come entirely
          from a study of native sources, viz.: The inscriptions on bricks
          out of which structures were built or streets or squares paved,
          on door-sockets, on votive offerings of various materials, on
          record-tablets of clay or stone, on statues, on cylinders of
          varying form, on cones, vases, and bowls (see
          [833]Inscriptions). The writing in which these records were made
          is called cuneiform or wedge-shaped, from the form of the simple
          elements of which most of the characters are composed. It exists
          in two varieties, concerning which two theories have been stated
          and defended. One is that the earlier form is not a language in
          the sense of a distinct speech, but is a cryptic or artificial
          method of writing, corresponding loosely with the hieratic of
          Egypt. Along with this may go the hypothesis that there was no
          pre-Semitic race in Babylonia, and that the whole civilization
          was Semitic in origin and development. The second theory is that
          this method of writing was a distinct tongue, belonging to a
          non-Semitic family, akin to the Mongol-Tataric group. For a
          number of years modern students of Babylonian inscriptions were
          in two camps nearly equally divided in numbers and authority.
          But within the last twenty-five years the advocates of the
          second theory have become the more numerous, until at the
          present day Halévy in France, McCurdy in Canada, and Price and
          Jastrow in the United States are the only scholars of high rank
          who support the first theory. A reason for the long debate is
          that the cuneiform is exceedingly complex and its acquisition
          difficult. The signs are conventional, not natural. Different
          forms exist for the same sound, and the same character may have
          different values, syllabic or ideographic, and may therefore be
          pronounced in a number of ways and may also carry more than one
          meaning.

    4. The Sumerian-Akkadian Language.

          The facts which have abundantly established the reality of a
          Sumerian-Akkadian language may be summed under two heads (1) The
          character of the writing. As already noted above, the Sumerian
          differs in vocabulary, root-forms, and grammar from the Semitic
          type. It has not the triliteral, triconsonantal roots of the
          latter, lacks the accidence of gender, is not inflectional, is
          fond of compounded words, has a unique numeral system, uses
          postpositions instead of prepositions, while dependent clauses
          precede major clauses and causal particles follow their clauses.
          (2) Facts in history. The existence of two languages is
          presupposed by the ethnology of the land, a Mongolian people
          gradually conquered by a Semitic. Hammurabi entrusted his
          records to both methods of writing, this proceeding being
          exactly what would be expected of a king ruling a dual realm
          whose subjects were of different races and tongues. The texts
          are often bilingual in alternate lines, and Sumerian-Semitic
          dictionaries or syllabaries are found. Moreover, religious
          formulas, ritualistic and magical, are in the Sumerian language
          and persist so down to the latest times. This is in accord with
          the universal law of religions, according to which ritual and
          other formulae are retained in use long after the language has
          ceased to be understood. Further, the employment of the Sumerian
          language was provincial; its home was in the south and there it
          lingered longest. This tallies with what is but the other face
          of the same fact, viz., that the south was the region latest
          subdued by the conquering Semites. Moreover, the antagonism
          between the north and the south which study of the history
          discloses is in part explained by difference in race, which in
          this case accompanies difference in speech. Add to the foregoing
          that a tablet in the Semitic tongue mentions by name the
          Akkadian, stating that in a "great tablet house" (library) the
          "tongue of Akkad is in the third [room]." Akkadian and Sumerian
          were dialectical varieties of the same speech.

    5. The Assyrio-Babylonian Language.

          The other language, the Assyrio-Babylonian, was of the common
          Semitic type, inflectional, its roots were triliteral and
          triconsonantal, and it belonged to the north Semitic branch
          which included the Aramaic, Phenician, and Hebraic families. It
          presents few difficulties to the average scholar in Semitic,
          apart from those offered in the reading of the character itself.
          The twofold method of writing goes back to about 4000 B.C. But
          after the final conquest by the Semites, c. 2250 B.C., the use
          of the Sumerian tongue was almost entirely confined to matters
          religious or magical. To the world-speech it has given one word
          at least of value, "Sabbath."

    6. The Literature.

          In one or the other, sometimes in both, of these languages the
          literature of Babylonia was written. In the earliest period, and
          in the south down to the middle period, records were entirely in
          the Sumerian. The substance of the literature is very varied. It
          may be comprised under six heads: historical, diplomatic,
          scientific, religious, commercial, and legal. (1) The historical
          material includes the record of the operations of government.
          Noticeable is the fact that the records of the kings of the land
          deal largely with temple-building or the excavation of canals or
          beautification of cities--a striking contrast to the record of
          martial exploits which so nearly fill Assyrian annals. (2)
          Diplomatic intercourse is suggested by the Amarna correspondence
          (see [834]Amarna Tablets). (3) The scientific writings include
          books on history, geography, astrology, astronomy, medicine,
          mathematics, and linguistics. (4) Religious texts include the
          epics, myths, folk-tales, and the ritual of prayer, psalmody,
          incantation, and magic. (5) The commercial texts, forming by far
          the greatest bulk of the inscriptions recovered, are usually
          inventoried under the name "contract tablets," a term which is
          far too narrow to describe accurately the great variety of these
          documents. They are oftener records of transactions completed
          than statements of agreements to be carried out. They cover
          every phase of social, even of family, life, and deal with
          marrying and purchase, renting of land and hiring of persons,
          with crops and merchandise and handicrafts. (6) For the legal
          literature see [835]Hammurabi and his Code.

          The writing of this literature was often microscopic and had to
          be read with the help of a magnifying-glass. It is interesting
          to note in this connection that a lens (of crystal) evidently
          used for such a purpose is now in the British Museum. Long works
          appeared on a series of tablets, and the order in the series was
          indicated by marginal notes such as are made on modern sheets
          intended as copy for the printer or as employed in commercial
          correspondence. Copying of old tablets was often most faithfully
          done, and some late documents exist which record that in the
          exemplar followed by the scribe there was a hiatus in the text.
          The poetry, like that of the Hebrews, was characterized by
          parallelism, and the strophical structure is often evident.

    7. The Civilization.

          Nippur is the only place where systematic excavations have been
          carried down to the stratum manifesting the beginning of the
          city in the collection of inflammable reed huts so often burned
          down with evident loss of life. Written records began much
          later. According to the chronology assumed by this article, the
          earliest documents date back to about 4500 B.C. At that time
          there were cities which possessed an advanced civilization,
          where the social fabric was already complex, and where the
          strife for empire was already violent. Public works were carried
          on by the government, and division of labor had been
          accomplished. The condition was such that a long antecedent
          development is necessarily assumed. Thus it is known that Nippur
          had four navigable canals, possibly one of them the regular
          channel of the Euphrates of the time. It was not so very long
          before the two great canals, the Shatt-al-Nil (probably the
          Chebar of Ezekiel) and the Shatt-al-Hai were in existence. The
          former branched off from the Euphrates above where Babylon stood
          later, struck out toward the interior of the country and, after
          running south over 100 miles, joined the same river nearly
          opposite Ur. The Shatt-al-Hai started from the Euphrates a
          little below Ur and crossed the country in a northeasterly
          direction till it joined the Tigris. In the extreme north, just
          below Sippar, another canal united the two rivers. Besides these
          great channels others are known to have existed and in many
          cases their courses may still be traced. By 3000 B.C. these
          works had made Babylonia the land of many waters. As a further
          evidence of the advance of civilization it is shown that as
          early as 4000 B.C., tin and antimony were used to harden copper
          and to make it more fusible. Another indication of culture are
          the many testimonies to an early commerce which embraced
          probably all Arabia, the Sinaitic peninsula, Egypt, and the
          Mediterranean coast region; and a remarkable fact is startling
          to learn, namely, that the Nippur arch is placed by Hilprecht
          prior to 4000 B.C. (Nippur, p. 399) The corbeled arch shown in
          the same work (p. 420) is not a true arch, but is similar to the
          Mycenæan gateways formed of stones beveled so as to meet at the
          top. This period, therefore, was one of regulated commerce,
          advanced public works, and large international intercourse.
          Cadastral surveys were made by the government in the fifth
          pre-Christian millennium as a basis for taxation and for the
          regulating of sales of land. Civilized methods of government
          were therefore employed.

    8. Slavery and the Status of Women.

          The legal provisions are also of value in revealing the type of
          civilization. Slavery is in evidence during all periods. Slaves
          were of two classes, private and public; in the latter case they
          might belong to the government or to the temples. Public slaves
          were doubtless employed on the great public works; temple slaves
          were used in the usual menial offices about the temples, and
          also in tilling the temple lands. Even in Sumerian times the law
          protected the slave from ill-treatment. The servitor was often
          apprenticed to a handicraft that his labor might be more
          profitable to his owner. But he might engage in trade on his own
          account and, if fortunate, even purchase his freedom. Records
          are known where a slave lent his master money and at the usual
          interest. The whole impression given by usages respecting
          slavery is therefore that of a mild and comfortable culture.
          This impression is heightened by the tendency of law and custom
          respecting marriage. While the usage was theoretically
          polygamous, the many protections thrown around the wife and her
          dower, the hindrances to divorce and the penalties for it, and
          the mutual agreements contrary to polygamy indicate that the
          practise was predominatingly monogamous. Not opposed to this
          general appearance is the showing made by the status of woman.
          She could hold property, could trade, and might maintain and
          defend actions at law. Partnership of man and wife in conduct of
          business is often in evidence. The freedom of woman is one of
          the noteworthy features of Babylonian life.

    9. Occupations.

          In full accord with the indications already given is the
          diversity of the activities of the early population. Besides the
          agriculturist and shepherd, there were weavers and fullers and
          dyers--Babylonian garments in a later period were in high
          repute--brickmakers and potters, smiths of various sorts and
          carpenters and stonecutters, goldsmiths and jewelers and carvers
          in wood and ivory. The learned professions included, besides the
          priests who gave tone to society, scribes who acted as teachers
          and librarians and publishers and notaries, physicians and
          astronomers and musicians. Gold, silver, copper, and ivory, and
          later bronze, glass, and lapis lazuli, were worked and employed
          in the useful and ornamental arts.

    10. Science.

          It is not improbable that the high scientific attainments of the
          first pre-Christian millennium have been mistakenly read back
          into much earlier times. Doubtful is the claim that eclipses
          were correctly predicted before the Assyrian age; though by that
          time the periodicity of these events was well known and records
          of eclipses and obscurations were kept at Borsippa and Sippar.
          Science was inaccurate, the fallacy of post hoc propter hoc
          being characteristic of this as of all early civilizations, most
          evident in the doctrine of omens.

          The civilization thus described is Sumerian-Akkadian, not
          Semitic, as the preponderating weight of scholarship now
          affirms. The Semites came in upon this civilization and adopted
          and adapted it so that its ideals became theirs,--even the
          theology was taken over and remolded in the Semitic
          consciousness.

  VI. History.

    1. Chronology.

    1. The Data.

          Babylonian chronology rests upon the same general facts as that
          of [836]Assyria (q.v.). The absolute datum is the eclipse of the
          year 763 B.C. The other dates depend upon synchronisms, either
          stated or computed by means of comparison of native documents
          such as the King-list or the Babylonian Chronicle, or upon
          individual statements respecting date, genealogy, and the like.
          Besides these data, the form of the characters in the documents
          often gives a clue to the relative age of certain documents and
          therefore of the maker. The King-list gives the names of kings
          c. 2400-625 B.C. A second King-list gives the first and second
          dynasties of Babylon. The Babylonian Chronicle refers to members
          of the first, fifth, sixth, and seventh dynasties, and another
          Chronicle gives parts of three dynasties, furnishing a check
          upon the first. The most important isolated data are the
          following. A king named E-(dingir)nagin calls himself a son of
          Akurgal; Entena is named son of En-anna-tum and descendant of
          Ur-Nina, while En-anna-tum II is son of Entena; and the daughter
          of Ur-Bau is called the wife of Nammaghani. These items give the
          succession in a dynasty. Burnaburiash is shown by the
          [837]Amarna Tablets (q.v.) to have been a contemporary of
          Thothmes III and IV of Egypt, and he is stated by Nabonidus to
          have reigned 700 years after Hammurabi. This datum places
          Hammurabi about 2100 B.C., which comes within a century of the
          date obtained from other sources. A king named
          Shagarakti-buriash is placed by Nabonidus c. 800 years before
          his own time, a date which agrees well with the character of the
          name and with other indications. A boundary-stone of the fourth
          regnal year of Bel-nadinapli (1118 B.C.) asserts that from
          Gulkishar, king of the Sea Lands, to Nebuchadrezzar I, was 696
          years, which item locates Gulkishar c. 1818 B.C. Sennacherib
          asserts that 418 years before 689 B.C., Marduk-nadin-ahi of
          Babylon carried off two images from Assyria; this datum fixes
          the year of the victory as 1107 B.C., while the beginning of
          Marduk-nadin-ahi's reign is settled as 1117 by a stone telling
          of a victory over Assyria in his tenth regnal year.
          Asshurbanipal relates that in a certain year (known to be 640
          B.C.) he brought back from Elam an image carried thither 1,635
          years earlier by Kudur-nanhundi, an Elamite, thus placing the
          Elamite invasion c. 2275 B.C. This fits in exceedingly well with
          the datum about the date of Hammurabi referred to above.
          Nabonidus states in the inscription in which he dates
          Shagarakti-buriash (ut sup.) that he found the cornerstone of
          the temple of Shamash at Nippur laid by Naram-Sin 3,200 years
          earlier, thus placing Naram-Sin about 3750 B.C., and giving the
          date by which to locate early events.

    2. Value of Nabonidus's Dates.

          There have been in recent years attempts to reduce the age of
          Sargon and Naram-Sin by from 318 to about 1,000 years. For the
          shorter reduction alone is there positive indication, the fact
          being that a dynasty which reigned 318 years is sometimes
          repeated, and it is supposed that Nabonidus included in his
          reckoning this doubled period. The round numbers which appear in
          Nabonidus's statements are also the objects of suspicion. But
          there are certain facts which lead to the conclusion that
          Nabonidus was not far out of the way. In the first place, he was
          very much the antiquarian, very little the king. His very care
          in going to the foundations of buildings he was engaged in
          restoring and his evident pride in recording his archeological
          discoveries is a prima facie testimony to his good faith.
          Moreover, the statements he makes are, in general, consistent
          with each other and with the results from other sources.
          Throwing light upon antiquarian methods in the time of this king
          is a squeeze of a tablet of Sargon I, i.e., an impress with
          raised letters reading backward. It is an example of scientific
          work done about 550 B.C. Moreover, as suggesting sources for the
          calculations of this king in records preserved till his time,
          there was found at Nippur a collection of tablets of different
          periods from the assumed date of Sargon to 615 B.C., this
          collection sealed up in a jar. It is not beyond the bounds of
          probability, therefore, that Nabonidus had access to documents
          similar to these upon which he based his calculations. Inasmuch
          as there is no positive evidence against the date for Sargon
          furnished by Nabonidus, and objections to it come principally
          from a distrust of statements involving high antiquity, and
          taking into account the indications derived (a) from depth of
          debris, (b) from the changes in the character of the writing,
          and (c) from allusions to Eridu as once situated on the Gulf,
          the probability is suggested that no great change is likely to
          be required in the general system of dates now adopted
          tentatively for early Babylonia.

    2. The Pre-Sargonic Age, 4500-3800 B.C.

    1. En-shag-kushanna.

          History opens with the mention of En-shag-kushanna, who names
          himself king of Kengi, the name for South Babylonia or Sumer. He
          also calls himself patesi [7] of En-lil of Nippur. He is
          doubtless a Sumerian, as is shown both by his name and his
          region; but that the Semite is already in the land and even
          among the king's subjects is clear. With this first of the known
          kings of the land comes also knowledge of the strife between
          North and South. Other cities are in existence, and the
          relations are not friendly. Girsu and Kish are named, and
          hostilities had been carried on by En-shag-kushanna with the
          latter, for he names it "the wicked of heart"; and he must have
          conquered it, for he presented spoil from it at Nippur.

    2. Uru-kagina.

          Not far from the time of this king another is heard of from
          Shirpurla whose name is Uru-kagina, and his title of king
          indicates that his city was then the head of the district. He is
          known by several inscriptions, which reveal him building temples
          and digging canals. The preeminence of the south is still
          indicated, for soon after the ruler of Kish is the patesi U-dug,
          perhaps contemporary with En-ge-gal, who is called king of
          Girsu.

    3. Mesilim.

          Yet how quickly the fortune of war changes is shown by the fact
          that the next ruler of Kish is Mesilim, named as lord paramount,
          who intervenes to fix the boundaries between two cities, Gishban
          and Shirpurla, while the ruler of the latter receives the title
          patesi. That the lordship of Mesilim was more than nominal
          appears from the mention of Ush who is patesi of Gishban, while
          the ruler of Girsu has the same title; and that the hegemony was
          not temporary is proved by the fact that the succeeding ruler of
          Kish, named Lugal-da-ag (?), bore the title king. But with the
          names which appear next the leadership reverts to the south with
          the dynasty of Shirpurla in control.

    4. Ur-Nina, Akurgal, Eannatum, Entemena.

          Of the names of eight persons connected with this dynasty the
          first two, Gursar and Gunidu, seem only ancestors of the later
          rulers. The rest follow in the order Ur-Nina, Akurgal, father of
          Eannatum and Enannatum I, the latter the father of Entemena and
          grandfather of Enannatum II. The third, fourth, and fifth of
          these had the title king, the others were patesis. Ur-Nina is
          known as a constructor of temples and canals, bringing wood for
          his temples from Arabia, suggesting either conquest or commerce.
          His time and that of his son Akurgal seem peaceful; but with his
          grandson the Semites are once more aggressive. It is from
          Eannatum that the celebrated stele of vultures comes, recording
          his victory over the Semites, from whom he delivered Ur and
          Erech. The results were so great and the confidence gained so
          decided that Eannatum invaded Elam and made Sumerian supremacy
          seem assured. From his nephew Entemena comes the celebrated
          silver vase, the most beautiful of the objects of high
          antiquity. After the reign of Enannatum II there is a gap, and
          the next ruler of Shirpurla claims only the title patesi.

    5. Alusharshid.

          From his time down to about 3850 B.C. a number of Semitic kings
          of Kish are known, the last of whom, Alusharshid, claimed to be
          "king of the world." This king invaded Elam and presented at the
          temples of Nippur and Sippar the "spoil of Elam" in the shape of
          inscribed marble vases. The Semites are thus shown advancing to
          control. The Semitic wedge meantime had been driven as far as
          Gutium, while a Semitic kingdom of Lulubi is known in the
          mountain regions of the lower Zab. These notes are interesting
          as showing the course and development of the growing power of
          the people from Arabia. Their entry must have been made into the
          region between the two rivers about the point where the Tigris
          and Euphrates make their nearest approach. There the wedge was
          inserted, the point penetrating beyond the Tigris. Semitic power
          developed both to north and to south, the latter the locality
          which resisted longest and where the Sumerian civilization
          remained unsubdued.

    6. Lugal-zagissi, Lugal-kigubnidudu, Lugal-kisalsi.

          About 4000 B.C. the patesi Ukush of Erech had a son
          Lugal-zaggisi (the names are Sumerian) who became king of Kish
          and Gishban, and seems to have made Erech the capital of a
          united Babylonia. He lauded En-lil as bestower of the kingship
          of the world, and claimed rule from the rising of the sun to its
          setting, from the "lower sea" (Persian Gulf) to the "upper sea"
          (Mediterranean or Lake Urumiah?). About 3900 B.C. there was a
          king of Erech named Lugal-kigubnidudu, known to be earlier than
          Sargon because the latter used his blocks at the gates, but what
          part he and his son Lugal-kisalsi took is unknown. The names of
          a number of rulers of other cities of this period appear in
          inscriptions as diggers of canals or builders of temples, or as
          marking offerings to the gods, and as bearing title either of
          king or patesi. The pre-Sargonic period therefore reveals the
          Semites in Northern Babylonia, striving for control of the whole
          land, at times achieving it only to be pushed back. Meanwhile
          they record their victories in the Sumerian tongue. The land had
          already become a region of canals, commerce had won its empire,
          and communication with the far west seems already established.

    3. Sargon to Hammurabi, 3800-2250 B.C.

    1. Sargon.

          Sargon's name was till about a decade ago the high mark of
          antiquity. This king is best known by the name just given,
          though he appears on the inscriptions as Shargani-shar-ali. An
          eighth century tablet, claimed to be a copy of an early one,
          tells his life-story to the effect that he was born of poor
          parents, that his mother put him in an ark of reeds and bitumen
          and committed him to the river which brought him to one Akkil,
          an irrigator, who reared him as a gardener, and that Ishtar made
          him king. Another tablet asserts that he mastered the Elamites
          and conquered Martu or Syria. His historical character, once
          seriously questioned, is now beyond doubt, and his name is
          linked with that of his son, Naram-Sin, in journeys of conquest
          as far as the Mediterranean, while both brought back wood from
          Lebanon for their temples. Sargon speaks of forming all
          countries into one, by which is doubtless meant an attempt at
          organizing the whole realm so that the alternations of
          government which had been the rule should cease. The capital was
          Akkad or Agade.

    2. Naram-Sin.

          His son was as famous as himself, both as warrior and builder.
          Nippur owed to him its great wall eighteen feet wide, laid on
          foundations in trenches that were sunk fifteen feet for security
          and built of bricks that bore his name. He claimed to be king of
          Sumer and Akkad and of "the four quarters of the world," a title
          often assumed by later rulers. Confirming the claim to control
          of the region is the fact that Lugal-ushum-gal appears as
          contemporary of both Sargon and his son, and is patesi (not
          king) of Shirpurla. He it is who calls Naram-Sin "the mighty god
          of Agade," and a seal from far-away Cyprus seems to indicate
          that even during his life Naram-Sin was deified. During this
          period Syria was under a governor named Uru-malik (a Canaanitic
          name), who ruled for the Babylonian overlord. A post was
          instituted, and literature was encouraged. Sargon had books of
          omens and of history compiled. In spite of the promise this
          Akkad dynasty seemed to show, after the reign of Sargon's
          grandson, Bingani-shar-ali, it sank out of sight. Its
          significance was its dominance for the time and its testimony to
          the ability of the Semites to carry on campaigns in as distant
          points as Elam and the Mediterranean.

    3. Ur-Bau and Gudea.

          With the fall of Akkad, Shirpurla once more comes into
          prominence, but the exact period can not be fixed within 300
          years. Between 3500 and 3200 B.C. appears Ur-Bau with the title
          patesi, followed by a son-in-law Nammaghani, also patesi, and
          he, after an interval, by Gudea. The first and last-named of
          these were the rulers for whom were made the beautiful statues
          of diorite mentioned above. The inscriptions, particularly those
          of Gudea, tell of his building operations in which he was
          inspired by the goddess Nina. His statues show the hands clasped
          in reverential attitude and in one case he is studying the plan
          of a building which is represented on a tablet placed on his
          knees. From Magan and Meluhha he brought dolerite and gold and
          gems, from Amanus cedar logs 105 feet long, and choice building
          stones from other regions. Here again is the suggestion of great
          commercial operations or else of widely extended powers.

    4. Ur-gur and Dungi.

          Who held the leadership in the time of these patesis is not
          known, but their successors recognized the suzerainty of the
          kings of Ur. Besides them a number of rulers of Shirpurla are
          known, but the succession is not completely made out. Gudea's
          successor was Ur-Ningirsu, then at intervals Akurgal II, Lukani,
          and Galalama, the date of the last being about 3100 B.C. The
          significance of this period is the renascence of Sumerian power.
          Ur shows the next attempt for supremacy, and the dating here
          also is still sub judice. The question is whether there were two
          pairs of kings bearing the names of Ur-gur and Dungi; if so they
          must be put about 450 years apart. Then Ur-gur I and Dungi I
          must be placed c. 3200-3150 B.C. and Ur-gur II and Dungi II
          2700-2650 B.C. An accumulation of indications suggest four of
          these kings and not two. The period under Ur-gur I was evidently
          one of Semitic decline similar to those seen in Assyria, for
          this king not only left monuments of himself in the shape of
          temples at Ur, Erech, Larsa, and Nippur, but he was in control
          of North Babylonia. Dungi calls himself king of the four
          quarters, implying complete mastery. It is once more
          characteristic that of the wars which must have been waged to
          construct this empire, not a word is said; the inscriptions deal
          with peaceful matters, mainly religious. The length of this
          dynasty is not known. A new aspirant for honors appears in the
          city of Isin under a Semitic dynasty, the kings whose names are
          certain being Ur-Ninib, Libit-Anunit, Bur-Sin, and Ishme-Dagan.
          It will be noted that the second element in each of these names
          is the name of a deity. Reversal comes with the son of
          Ishme-Dagan, Enannatum, who acknowledges himself a vassal of the
          king of Ur. But his predecessors had control of Ur, Eridu,
          Erech, and Nippur, the great religious centers, as well as of
          Cutha, the temples in all these places being restored by either
          Ur-gur or Dungi.

          The "second Ur dynasty" is a matter of grave debate. Radau names
          Gungunu and Ur-gur II, in which he is alone; generally accepted
          are Dungi II, Bur-Sin II, Gamil-Gin, and Ine-Sin; but Radau
          interjects a Dungi III after the second of the name, and Ur-Bau
          II after him, and Idin-Dagan after Ine-Sin. The decision must
          wait. The old title of Sargon is still in use, "king of the four
          quarters," and the Mediterranean region was visited either in
          trade or hostility.

    5. Nur-Ramman and Siniddina.

          The downfall of this dynasty brought Larsa to the fore, the
          kings of which signified their supremacy by using the customary
          title of Sargon. Only two kings appear here, Nur-Ramman and his
          son Siniddina, the latter a contemporary of Hammurabi. Temples
          in Ur and in Larsa, the wall and a canal for the latter city are
          among their constructive achievements. The supremacy of this
          city was cut short by an invasion of the Elamites, the mention
          by Asshurbanipal of the theft of the idol placing this raid
          about 2285 B.C.

    4. The Supremacy of Babylon, 2250-1783 B.C.

    1. The Elamites. Kudur-Mabug and Eri-aku.

          Even if the Elamitic raid had not taken place, another cause
          would have shortened the control by Larsa. A new people, of
          Arabian origin, had come to reenforce Semitic control. Under
          them Babylon had been growing in power, and was ready to assert
          itself. The attack of the Elamites undoubtedly made easier the
          assault of the Semites. The leader of the former was
          Kudur-Mabug, "a prince of the Western land" Anshan, which
          centuries later was to foster Cyrus. He established himself in
          South Babylonia, conciliated the religious by erecting a temple
          for Sin at Ur, and commended to that deity his son, who
          succeeded him, whose name is read Eri-aku and Rim-Sin, the two
          names being exact equivalents (see [838]Elam). Gen. xiv is right
          in making Arioch the contemporary of Hammurabi (Amraphel?) [8] .
          Over this Arioch Hammurabi claims a victory as well as over the
          king of Western Elam, which is the indication of a united
          Babylonia and marks the end of the political importance of the
          Sumerians. From this time on it is not the rivalry of different
          cities which is responsible for the clash of arms in the region,
          but the attempt of nations to possess it.

    2. The First Babylonian Dynasty. Hammurabi.

          The first dynasty of Babylon, to which Hammurabi (c. 2250 B.C.)
          belonged, numbered eleven kings, five before and five after him.
          The city had taken no part in large politics. Its rulers had
          doubtless been cementing their position, but no sign of it has
          come down. The only thing suggestive is the fortification of the
          city by Sumu-la-ilu, the second of the dynasty, while Zabu, his
          successor, had built a temple in Sippar to Anunit. For the reign
          of Hammurabi and his code see [839]Hammurabi. From his
          successors little has come down. His son carried on the usual
          building operations in Nippur and elsewhere; of the remaining
          four kings the only records are incidental references in
          commercial tablets, but they imply peace and prosperity in the
          land.

    3. The Second Babylonian Dynasty.

          The account of the next or second dynasty of Babylon (2250-1783
          B.C.) found in the King-lists is under grave suspicion on
          account of the length of the reigns assigned to the different
          kings. One is sixty regnal years, another fifty-six, another
          fifty-five, and a fourth fifty. From the period as yet not a
          single document has come to light. The King-lists give only the
          names. Hommel once held that the dynasty did not exist, but he
          now accepts as historical the first six kings.

    5. The Kasshite Period, 1788-1207 B.C.

    1. Agum-kakrime.

          The next dynasty was foreign and came from the East. They are
          known as Kasshites or Kosshites, and their home was the hill
          country north of Elam and between Babylonia and what became
          Persia. The movement which brought them into the land seems like
          an immigration of new peoples, virile and active, subduing a
          people used to peace, agriculture, and commerce in a quietude
          won for them by the great Hammurabi. Concerning this whole
          period little is known. There is only one inscription of any
          length belonging to these times, and the name of the king there
          mentioned is not given in the King-lists, which, in the part
          covering this period, are much mutilated. There is a votive
          tablet from the first known of the rulers, named Gandish, and
          some fragmentary inscriptions. The seventh ruler was probably
          Agum-kakrime, one of whose inscriptions was copied for
          Asshurbanipal's library. He called himself "king of Kasshu and
          Akkad, king of the broad land of Babylon." Other titles show
          that he claimed a very large empire, from the frontiers of
          Persia to the borders of Syria. He restored the images of Marduk
          and Sarpanit, which had been carried away by a people in the
          northeast. That the sway of religion had lost none of its power
          to enchant and enchain is shown by the active building
          operations which he carried on.

    2. Later Kasshite Kings.

          By about 1500 B.C. light breaks again, and Karaindash appears as
          a ruler who is devoted to the deities of the land and arranges
          his titles in Babylonian fashion. The Synchronistic History
          throws light on the period and reveals friendly relations with
          the young Assyrian empire. The two nations appear as equals,
          making treaties and settling boundaries. Only a little later a
          king is known as Kallima-Sin (or, as it is proposed to read his
          name, Kadashman-Bel), and he is found corresponding with
          Amenophis IV (see [840]Amarna Tablets). It is interesting to
          find in that correspondence discussion of a commercial treaty
          and of the customs duties to be exacted. It is also worth noting
          that a very close chronology is attainable here through the
          triple synchronisms from Babylonia, Assyria, and Egypt.
          Kurigalzu I (c. 1410 B.C.) followed Burnaburiash I, son of
          Kallima-Sin, using the titles "king of Sumer and Akkad, king of
          the four quarters." Burnaburiash II, correspondent of the
          Pharaoh Amenophis IV in the Amarna series, was next, but only
          the general peace of the world appears in his times. About 1370
          Karahardash succeeded, and his queen was the daughter of
          Asshur-uballit of Assyria. His son succeeded him, carried on a
          war with the Sutu, a nomadic people in the northwest, and on his
          return was killed by rebellious Kasshites. The principal events
          which followed are given in the article on Assyria. Kurigalzu II
          was placed on the throne, invaded Elam and captured Susa, as a
          votive tablet declares, and followed up the victory by defeating
          Bel-nirari of Assyria. A new conflict with the northern power
          was thus begun, in which the Assyrians were superior and for a
          time held Babylonia, 1285-69 B.C. Under Ramman-shum-user the
          latter began to recover its own, and by 1211 B.C. was
          reestablished in all its former territory. Four years later the
          Kasshite dynasty came to an end.

    6. The Isin and Assyrian Periods, 1207-625 B.C.

    1. Nebuchadrezzar I and His Successors.

          The nominal rulers of the land in the next period were the
          members of a dynasty of eleven kings known from the King-list as
          the dynasty of Isin. Whether this city was the one active in
          politics 1,700 years earlier, or whether it was a part of the
          city of Babylon, is yet under debate. The names of the first
          five kings are lost, the sixth was Nebuchadrezzar I, c. 1135
          B.C. The period was marked by Assyrian attacks. Even
          Nebuchadrezzar was twice defeated, though he was a warrior of
          great ability who carried his arms to Syria on the west and to
          Elam on the east. He was followed by Bel-nadin-apal and he by
          Marduk-nadin-ahi. The latter made a successful attack upon Syria
          which was punished later by the capture of Babylon and
          subjection of the whole country by Tiglath-Pileser I, c. 1100
          B.C. The King-list gives a succession of five dynasties, one
          that of the "Sea Lands," the place from which the Chaldeans were
          later to issue, a second of "Bazi," another of Elam, a fourth of
          Babylon, and still another of the Far South, of which the noted
          Merodach-baladan was a member. But all of these held the throne
          either by sufferance or appointment of Assyria or assumed it
          during the temporary quiescence of that power.

    7. The Kaldu or Chaldean Period, 625-538 B.C.

    1. Nebopolassar.

          The many attempts made by Merodach-baladan to gain control of
          Babylon (see [841]Assyria) were important, not in themselves so
          much, as for the foreshadowing of the rising supremacy of the
          Chaldeans. The kingdom of the Sea Lands had formed around the
          headwaters of the Persian Gulf, and its dominant people, fresh
          from Arabia, were feeling their way to world empire. The decay
          of the Assyrian power was their opportunity. Nabopolassar made
          himself king of Babylon. While he was absent attacking the
          outskirts of his kingdom in Mesopotamia, the Assyrian
          Sin-shar-ishkun invaded Babylonia, probably 610-609 B.C., and
          Nabopolassar was cut off from his base. The Umman-Manda, an
          aggregation of tribes gathered about a Median nucleus, brought
          about the fall of Assyria, and Nabopolassar was left free to
          establish himself. Already great numbers of his tribesmen had
          entered Babylonia, and the possession of the capital gave him
          the needed prestige to rally them around him. The native
          Babylonians were ready to receive him because of their hatred to
          the Assyrian oppressor, so he succeeded as the head of Semitic
          Asia. Another fact had doubtless much to do with the ease with
          which he assumed power. The religious interest of Babylonia
          seems to have absorbed his attention, and he acted like a son of
          the soil whose heart was fully in accord with Babylonian ideals.
          This is illustrated by the fact that though the events of his
          reign must have been stirring and important, the three
          inscriptions he left are concerned with building of temples and
          digging of canals. Among the great events was the defeat of the
          Egyptian Necho by his son and general, Nebuchadrezzar. Necho had
          already seized the western appanages of Assyria, against which
          doubtless Nabopalassar was intending to operate in his
          Mesopotamian campaign, and had led forth a great army in hope of
          gaining a still larger share of the defunct Assyrian empire. The
          two armies, Egyptian and Chaldean, met at Carchemish, the
          Egyptians were defeated and pursued to the very border of Egypt
          by the victorious Nebuchadrezzar. The latter there received
          tidings of the death of his father, and the very newness of the
          kingdom required his instant presence at home.

    2. Nebuchadrezzar II.

          Nebuchadrezzar II (604-562 B.C.) has left many inscriptions,
          which, like his father's, tell little of battles and campaigns
          and much of his constructive labors on the city of Babylon, his
          pride. The story of his campaigns comes largely from other
          sources, partly Biblical. The refusal of Jehoiakim to pay
          tribute caused Nebuchadrezzar to let loose on him the
          neighboring hostile tribes, and paved the way for the campaign
          in 597 B.C. in which Jerusalem was taken and its inhabitants in
          part deported. Renewed rebellion stirred up by the new Pharaoh,
          Hophra, led to a reoccupation of Palestine; Hophra was defeated,
          Jerusalem taken, and its defenses destroyed in 586 B.C. Tyre was
          assailed and a siege of thirteen years resulted, after which
          terms were made. Civil war in Egypt gave Nebuchadrezzar his
          opportunity, the country was invaded and plundered as a
          punishment for its intrigues in Palestine and Syria. There can
          be little doubt that the alliance of the Chaldean with the house
          of Media in his marriage of Amuhia, daughter of Cyaxares, did
          much to cement his power. It hardly seems an accident that the
          force of Media should have been spent in the north, westward
          into Asia Minor, while Nebuchadrezzar's operations covered the
          regions southward. Something of Nebuchadrezzar's building
          operations has been told in the description of Babylon (see
          above, [842]IV, § 12), but how extensive these were can be
          appreciated only in the light of Rawlinson's statement that he
          examined the ruins of not less than one hundred places in the
          vicinity of Babylon and in very few were there not found traces
          of Nebuchadrezzar's activity. In a land whose kings were all
          builders not one of the rulers had approached him in the extent,
          variety, completeness, and magnificence of his buildings.

    3. Nabonidus and Belshazzar. The Fall of Babylon.

          Of Nebuchadrezzar's son, Amil-Marduk (562-560 B.C.), Only II
          Kings xxv, 27 (where he is called Evil-merodach) and Berosus
          give any information. The one records an act of mercy, the other
          asserts that he reigned lawlessly. He was assassinated and the
          chief conspirator, Neriglissar (560-556 B.C.) seized the throne.
          Temples and canals absorbed his interest, and he was succeeded
          by Labashi-Marduk who reigned nine months and was assassinated.
          Nabonidus (555-538 B.C.) was the last Semitic king of Babylon.
          He was a pietist, an antiquarian, and a temple-builder, with but
          little aptitude for the cares of State and little interest in
          them. How he contributed to present knowledge has been told in
          the section on chronology in this article and that on Assyria.
          He resided most of the time at Tema, a place not otherwise
          known. His son Belshazzar may have been associated as regent
          with him, though there is no authority in the inscriptions for
          calling him king. Between the time of Nebuchadrezzar and
          Nabonidus relations with the Medes had been broken off. Cyrus,
          the king of Anshan, had enlarged his realm, and finally, having
          defeated Astyages, had assumed the title, king of Persia. He had
          overthrown Croesus, and all Asia Minor at once fell into his
          hands. His next move would obviously be southward to Babylonia,
          but Nabonidus made no preparation for the crisis that was
          coming. When the war finally broke out, he collected the statues
          of the gods of Babylon, left the command of the army to
          Belshazzar, and when the latter was defeated fled into Babylon.
          Gobryas led the victorious army against the capital, where a
          sturdy and indeed successful defense might have been expected.
          The walls and gates which might have defied the best that Cyrus
          could do proved no protection, and though there is no proof that
          such is the fact, historical probability can offer no
          explanation of the speedy capture of the city other than that
          Nabonidus's worst enemy was within, and that from within the
          gates swung open to admit the captor. Thus the rule of Asia
          passed from the Semites to the Aryans to hold until at the end
          of a millennium Arabia should once more discharge its hordes and
          in the Mohammedan conquest make a new era. See [843]Cyrus the
          Great; [844]Persia.

  VII. The Religion.

    1. Historical Development.

    1. Political Factors.

          The survey of the political geography and history of Babylonia
          shows it to have been as early as 4500 B.C. what it continued to
          be, a land of cities. History shows also that even at that early
          date there was a tendency toward what later became
          nationalization, in the effort of one or another city to control
          the whole land. These two features are reproduced in the
          religion. Each city had a deity who claimed the worship of the
          inhabitants; frequently there were two, generally in that case a
          god and a goddess, originally in all probability not spouse and
          consort, but independent. And in the pre-Sargonic period there
          are clear evidences that one of the gods of one of the cities
          had attained an eminence, not indeed of kingship over the gods,
          but of position among them. The general disposition of kings who
          took their titles from cities other than Nippur to devote their
          spoil to En-lil and to deposit it in his temple, suggests for
          him a general recognition not accorded to other deities, even to
          Ea of Eridu. While no specific claim of lordship over the gods
          was made for En-lil, not only was he practically the chief of
          the gods, but a theoretical headship is implied in the
          theological fiction by which later Marduk's definite claim to
          preeminence was supported, viz., that En-lil had transferred to
          the deity of Babylon the leadership among the gods because of
          the latter's victory over Tiamat, the demon of chaos, though, of
          course, the real reason of Marduk's supremacy was the hegemony
          of Babylon. The principle of centralization, of nationalization,
          was clearly at work in the sphere of religion as well as of
          politics. But this was limited by another principle, that
          preeminence among the gods did not involve supersession of other
          gods in their own seats of worship. En-lil was ever localized
          only in Nippur, Marduk had his seat only in Babylon, just as
          Asshur never set up his throne and temple in Babylon even during
          the Assyrian period. The political strife between Sumerian and
          Semite was also reflected in the religion. There can be no doubt
          of two facts: first, the Sumerians had a decided favoritism for
          female deities; second, Semitic female deities were, with the
          single exception of Ishtar, but the pale reflection of the gods.
          While then in the earliest periods the goddesses were numerous
          and prominent, in later times they either faded out of
          existence, were made the consorts of the gods and so became
          eclipsed, or were identified with Ishtar.

    2. The Philosophical-Priestly Factor.

          In the development of the religion, besides the political
          principle, there became operative also a philosophical-priestly
          activity. Out of this grew the semidetachment of certain gods
          from extreme localization and connections were formed for them
          having cosmic meaning. Noticeable here is the formation of the
          two principal triads: Anu, heaven-god, Bel or En-lil earth-god,
          Ea water-god, and Sin of the moon, Shamash of the sun, and
          Ramman (Adad) of the storm or cloud. While worship of these gods
          still centered at definite temples, in invocations they were
          addressed more generally. Their association with larger
          phenomena made them accessible to a larger clientele, just as
          Nebo's association with prophecy made him the object of a larger
          circle of worshipers than was rightly his in his position as god
          of Borsippa. And the philosophical principle worked also in the
          reduction of the number of the deities, particularly of the
          goddesses. The notion of identification was particularly
          insistent, so that many of the Sumerian goddesses were in time
          pronounced the same as Ishtar, and that deity made her way to
          her unique position as the one great goddess of Babylonia.

    3. Decrease in the Number Deities.

          This reduction in number of deities is completely proved. In the
          period from c. 2250 B.C. on, besides the eight great gods
          already named, only Marduk, Ninib, Nergal, and Nusku have any
          prominence. Tammuz might perhaps be added, but it is possible to
          maintain that in his worship Ishtar was the central figure. Yet
          in earlier times the number of the deities was very much
          greater. Manictusu, an early king of Kish, mentions about fifty
          deities. The incantation texts, coming from an earlier stratum
          of thought and practise, increase the number greatly, one series
          alone giving 150 god-names. There can be no doubt that the
          sun-gods of the various cities were originally separate, though
          the priestly philosophy regarded them as the same; this can be
          said also of the moon-deities, who became one in Sin.

    4. The Earliest Religion Animistic.

          Etymology enables the investigator to go still farther back and
          posit for earliest Babylonia an animistic worship when spirits
          were numerous, some of whom rose to high position and became
          great gods. This is demonstrable in the cases of En-lil ("Lord
          of Spirits"), Ea, and Damkina, the consort of Ea, and is
          practically certain in several other cases. Secondly, the entire
          system of magic and incantation is the surest proof that animism
          preceded polytheism in old Babylonia.

    5. Spirits and Demons.

          To illustrate the belief in spirits, mention may be made of the
          Sumerian zi, "the living thing," having about the same
          connotation as "spirit" in animistic usage. The lil were ghosts,
          subterranean spirits of the darkness and storm, sexless,
          attended by vampires. En-lil means "Lord of Ghosts," and he was
          the destroyer in the deluge. Utukku meant "demon," a ghost
          escaped from the dead; and another name for demon was ekimmu, a
          being which took delight in obsessing the living. The demons
          were numberless, had their dwelling in the desert, and were
          malign in their activities, working harm in all relations of
          life. So of other spirits it might be said that they swarmed--on
          the earth, in the air, under the earth, in the waters; there
          were spirits for every sort of existence and they controlled or
          might affect for good or ill every deed, even the thoughts and
          dreams, of men. The actions of even the good spirits might be
          inimical; the bad spirits must ever be guarded against.

    6. Magic.

          Hence there had grown up in the earliest times known an
          empirical magic, a routine of enchantment, a ritual of spells,
          the forms and practise of which are vouched for by hundreds of
          tablets. Since sickness, disease, and misfortune were often
          believed to be due to the malignity of evil powers,
          self-determined or directed by the evilly disposed among men,
          the means of release lay in charms or enchantments which
          included the employment of formulas, or which used fire, water,
          herbs, or metals without magical sayings. Series of incantation
          rituals have been discovered, named from the demons they aim to
          foil or from the parts of the body affected by illness, or from
          the means used in the exorcism. And these remained potent
          throughout the existence of Babylonia as a realm and then
          continued their power in the West whither they were
          transplanted. Other signs of the animism once existent are found
          in the animal forms of the gods, while the ritual of worship led
          the worshiper to figure forth his relationship to the god by
          assuming raiment which typified animal or other forms of life.
          This is Sumerian; the development under Semitism was
          anthropomorphic. On the other hand, man was himself
          deified--this was the case with Naram-Sin, while Gudea and
          Gimil-Sin erected temples to their own godhead.

          The transition to polytheism never involves complete dissolution
          of the prior animism. Survivals of the older faith ever
          perpetuate ancient practise. The gods of Babylonia evolved from
          the spirits; in some cases the process can almost be measured,
          but the spirits lived on. By 4500 B.C., however, there were
          already great deities whose majesty was acknowledged beyond
          their own cities.

    2. The Gods.

    1. Anu.

          The deities who were earliest grouped in a triad were Anu, Bel
          (En-lil), and Ea. Of these Anu (Sumerian Ana), or Bel-shamayim,
          "Lord of heaven," as he came to be considered, appears to have
          been first localized at a place called Der, not otherwise known,
          and subsequently worshiped at Erech. He was the nearest to an
          abstraction of all Babylonian deities and the first to be
          disassociated from local connections and universalized (fourth
          millennium B.C.). Perhaps because of this disassociation he was
          the oftener invoked in prayer and incantation. The assignment of
          a supramundane region of control marks the beginning of priestly
          philosophy. Lugal-zaggisi claimed to be Anu's priest, and it was
          this king who first, so far as is yet known, united in a triad
          the three gods just mentioned. Anu was often known as ilu, the
          god par excellence, with whom other deities took refuge. He was
          called the father of Ishtar, and his consort was Antum (Semitic
          Anat), perhaps remembered in the birthplace of Jeremiah,
          Anathoth.

    2. Bel.

          Of Bel or En-lil, god of Nippur, much has already been said. His
          commanding position, compelling homage from hostile kings, was
          gained before the making of the first records which have so far
          been recovered. Bel's Sumerian ideograph represents the ram
          (suggesting a totemistic connection), while the meaning of his
          name, "Lord of Spirits," or "demons," has already been noted. In
          an inscription of En-shagkushanna Bel is named "King of the
          Lands," the one explicit statement of his eminence among the
          gods. In accordance with his name he was lord of the underworld,
          and as such was especially concerned with incantations. His
          consort was the Sumerian goddess Nin-harsag, the "Lady of the
          Mountain" (Semitic Belit), and his temple was E-kur,
          "Mountain-House". The preeminence he had was lost to Marduk when
          Babylon became the chief city and its god assumed the principal
          place in the pantheon.

    3. Ea.

          The third member of the triad and god of Eridu, Ea (Sumerian
          En-ki, "Lord of the Country"), had the waters as his division of
          the universe. The earliest traditions connect him with the
          Persian Gulf, whence he used to emerge daily to instruct his
          people in the civilizing arts. As associated with the deep, he
          became god of the river Euphrates, and then of the river which,
          according to Babylonian cosmography, encircled the earth. As a
          water-deity he was a god of knowledge, therefore of culture,
          light, beneficence, and healing. And by these same attributes he
          was also a god of cunning and beguiled the first man out of
          immortality. His oracles came by the roar of the surf on the
          shore. He was depicted also as half man, half fish, and his
          worshipers are pictured in robes which mimic the skin of a fish,
          again suggesting totemism, an indication not lessened by the
          fact that his ideograph stands also for "antelope." As god of
          wisdom it was inevitable that Ea should have part in
          incantations. His attitude toward humanity is generally
          beneficent, and he is called the creator of men. His consort,
          Damkina, a Sumerian deity, was originally independent. They are
          credited with a son Asari, with whom Marduk was identified in
          order to legitimate his claim to the chief place among the gods.
          Each of the three deities associated with Eridu can be traced
          backward to animistic origins.

    4. Solar Deities. Shamash.

          The second triad consisted of Shamash (sun-god), Sin (moon-god),
          and Ramman or Adad (thunder or cloud-god). That the sun could
          not escape worship in such a land as Babylonia is a foregone
          conclusion, and that the deity of the sun should take different
          names was almost as inevitable. So of sun-gods there were, e.g.,
          Utu in Larsa, Shamash in Sippar, Nergal in Cutha, Za-mal-mal in
          Kish. Marduk was originally solar. That the sun's activity
          should be viewed in different ways is also natural, hence some
          of the deities mentioned remained distinct. But that gods of
          different cities having similar aspects should be identified was
          to be expected in accordance with the laws of religious
          evolution. So Shamash came to be worshiped in different centers,
          the sun-deities of those places being identified with him, while
          others like Ninib and Nergal were differentiated and given
          special functions as sun-gods of the morning and springtime or
          of noon and summer. The powers attributed to Shamash in his two
          principal seats of Sippar and Larsa were such as belonged to the
          kindly god of light,--powers of healing and revelation, as well
          as of protection by detection and punishment of crime. He was
          given as consort Nin-A, a Sumerian deity originally male, who
          under Semitic misunderstanding was made to change his sex.
          Another explanation, less probable, is that the change of sex is
          a sign of subordination of the Sumerian to the Semitic god.

    5. Lunar Deities. Sin.

          If the worship of sun-deities was notable, not less so was that
          of moon-gods. Both Semites and Sumerians encouraged the cult,
          but there are many signs that among the latter it was a
          favorite. So En-zu, "Lord of Wisdom," and Nan-nar, "Giver of
          Light," were names the Sumerians bestowed on this deity.
          Nan-nar's principal seat was at Ur, connected with Abraham in
          the Biblical narrative. As Sin, a Semitic deity, he was located
          at Harran, also associated with Abraham, and he gave its name to
          the mountain and peninsula of Sinai. It is noteworthy that at
          Harran the god's image took the form of a conical pillar, and
          this suggests another phase of animism, that of the phallic
          cult. With Nannar-Sin also was connected the attribute of
          imparting wisdom, giving knowledge, particularly of measures.

    6. Adad or Ramman.

          The third member of this triad was Adad (also read Ramman, the
          Rimmon of Syria), god of storms. This is the one deity whose
          localization never seems to have been effected. He seems to have
          developed out of the storm-spirits. His nature led him to be
          regarded both as beneficent and malevolent. The rains brought
          destruction, and also fertilization, to the fields. So he was
          invoked to bring blessing to friends and misfortune to foes.
          Perhaps this led to his association with Shamash in the function
          of punishing evil-doers. His consort was Shala, never an
          important deity, and her ideograph could represent also a
          milch-goat.

    7. Ishtar.

          A deity sometimes displacing Adad as third member of this triad
          was the great Ishtar. In Arabia and Moab Athtar was male. In one
          case in Babylonia a male god was identified with her, and
          androgyny is there in sight. She was patroness of Erech, and had
          shrines in many towns. She was too strong a personality to be
          the mere consort of a deity. The attempt was made to wed her;
          but it involved either that her consort should be subordinate
          because of her greatness, a thing unthinkable for Semites, or
          that she should be reduced to passivity, which that same
          greatness forbade. She is noted for the absorption and
          comprehension in her being of all the noted goddesses of old
          Babylonia. Nin-harsag of Erech (the great mother), the war-deity
          Nana of Erech, Nina of Shirpurla, Anunit (Sumerian Anuna) of
          Sippar, all yielded up their personalities to Ishtar as she grew
          in greatness, and her name came to be a synonym for "goddess."
          She even disdained the feminine termination ah in her name, and
          she was the Belit, "Mistress," as Marduk was Bel, "Lord," of the
          land. At her principal temple at Erech impure worship was a part
          of her ritual.

    8. Nergal.

          Nergal, already mentioned as personifying the sun's destructive
          action, was worshiped at Cutha in the temple E-shidlam, "House
          of Shade," at least from the time of Dungi till c. 700 B.C. He
          was a god of the dead in conjunction with Allatu, this flowing
          naturally from his office as destroyer. He, too, absorbed other
          deities (e.g., Ira, a fire-god) and took others as his servitors
          (e.g., Namtar, the plague-god). His consort as god of the dead
          was Eresh-Kigal, as a god of the living Laz. The pantheon of the
          dead was a late scholastic development.

    9. Ninib, Girru, and Tammuz.

          Ninib and Girru (Assyrian Nusku) were two deities who had
          absorbed a number of earlier gods. The former was connected with
          agriculture and war, the latter with the sun and with fire.
          Girru was also a victor over demons, and as such was much
          invoked in incantations. Tammuz (Sumerian Dumu-zi) was
          originally a sun-god, son of Ea, and bridegroom of Ishtar, a
          culture god of Eridu, of note chiefly because of his being the
          cause of Ishtar's descent into Hades which is the theme of one
          of the epics. In Syria he was Adonai, "my lord," and gave the
          Greeks their Adonis (cf. on the name Ninib, J. D. Prince, in
          JBL, xxiv, 1905, part 1, p. 54).

    10. Marduk.

          Marduk, the youngest of Babylonian deities, supreme in Bablyonia
          from c. 2250 till the fall of the Semitic power, owed his
          position first to the political preeminence of Babylon, secondly
          to priestly ingenuity which connected him with En-lil and then
          manufactured the fiction that because of Marduk's victory over
          Tiamat En-lil resigned to him his supremacy. To clear the way,
          Marduk was identified with Asari, son of En-lil. He was probably
          a sun-god, though his name seems to come from Amar-duggu, "good
          heifer," a title of Asari. Hammurabi seems to have been the
          first to declare his supremacy. Nabonidus appears to have
          attempted to carry this supremacy a step further and to have
          been thwarted by the priesthood. As it was, Marduk was never to
          Babylonia what Zeus was to Greece.

    11. Nebo.

          Nebo (from the same root as Hebrew nabhi, "prophet "; Sumerian
          Dim-sar, "Wise Scribe"), god of Borsippa, originally superior to
          Marduk, was subjected to the latter by being made his son. He
          was god of utterance, wisdom, revelation, writing, and culture.
          There appears to have been a connection with Ea of Eridu, but
          exactly what is not yet made out. As the god of wisdom Nebo was
          readily dissociated from local connections, and was even adopted
          in Assyria. Indeed he took on universal functions as the god of
          prophecy. As such he was kindly, and none of the dread which
          attached to thoughts of other deities appears in mention of him.

    3. The Priests and the Epics:

    1. Influence of the Priests.

          The type of worship has already been indicated in the article on
          Assyria. Among the kingly functions sacrifice continued. The
          priests were numerous, and though they appear little in the
          texts, their influence can always be read between the lines. The
          ill-starred attempt of Nabonidus to make Marduk more than he had
          been, to set him in a place like that of Asshur's in Assyria,
          was doubtless frustrated by priestly opposition. As the scribes,
          the teachers, the molders of theology and myth, in a country so
          devoted to a religion of set forms, the priests had an influence
          which can hardly be exaggerated. The cosmogony which is most in
          evidence is manifestly of their make and postdates the rise of
          Babylon to preeminence, since in it Marduk is conqueror of the
          rebellious Tiamat, "chaos," and out of her rent body creates the
          universe and then humankind.

    2. The Gilgamesh Epic.

          The three epics contain earlier material and doubtless took form
          before Semitism laid its hands upon them. The Gilgamesh epic is
          the earliest which contains the world-wide thought of a means of
          escape from death. In this case it is a tree, and after
          obtaining a scion and curing his own mortal illness Gilgamesh
          lost the scion while on his way home, it being stolen from him
          by a serpent as he was drinking from a spring. Here occur
          elements of comparison with the Genesis tree of life in the
          midst of the garden (not the tree of knowledge of which the
          first pair ate), and the serpent is also in evidence. A further
          point for comparison is that Gilgamesh was in opposition to
          deity in the person of Ishtar, not indeed by eating of the fruit
          of the tree but by slaying of a sacred bull. The eleventh tablet
          of the series contained the Babylonian deluge narrative (see
          [845]Noah).

    3. The Adapa Epic.

          A second epic connected with Eridu tells the story of the first
          man, Adapa (which name it has been proposed to read Adamu, cf.
          Expository Times, June, 1906, p. 416-417), and how he too just
          missed immortality through the guile of Ea. He was summoned to
          heaven to answer for breaking the wings of the south wind. Ea
          warned him not to partake of food while there, and by his
          obedience he failed of the immortality that the "food of life,"
          which was offered him, would have bestowed (see [846]Adam, II,
          § 5).

    4. Marduk and Chaos.

          The third epic, dealing with Marduk's contest with the demon,
          Chaos, has two points of interest: first, it bears upon its face
          its date, not earlier than Hammurabi, under whom it probably
          took form; second, it is manifestly a plagiarism from a much
          earlier story in which Ea was the hero who vanquished Apsu, "the
          deep," and then became creator and protector of men.

    5. Ishtar's Descent Into Hades.

          A fourth narrative, which hovers between epic and ritual,
          concerns the bereaval of Ishtar in the loss of her bridegroom
          Tammuz, to recover whom she descends into Hades. This narrative
          is late, its description of the environment of the underworld
          exhibiting the refinements of Semitic elaboration.

          1685; d. at Leipsic July 28, 1750. He belonged to a family which
          through several generations had distinguished itself by musical
          talent; lost his parents early, and had, from his fourteenth
          year, to provide for his own education. In 1703 he was appointed
          court-musician in Weimar; and in 1723, already one of the most
          celebrated musicians of the time, he was made cantor and
          director of church music at Leipsic. His celebrity during his
          lifetime he owed mainly to his skill as an organist and pianist;
          his compositions were not appreciated till a later age. They
          consist chiefly of church music, oratorios, masses, etc., for
          organ and orchestra, for instruments as well as for the human
          voice; after his death the manuscripts were divided among his
          sons, and remained unnoticed till the time of Mendelssohn. See

          BACHER, baH´er, WILHELM: Hungarian Jewish Orientalist; b. at
          Liptó-Szent-Mikós (65 m. s.w. of Cracow), Hungary, Jan. 12,
          1850. He was educated at the Evangelical Lyceum of Pressburg,
          and the universities of Budapest, Breslau, and Leipsic (Ph.D.,
          1870). He was graduated from the Jewish Theological Seminary of
          Breslau as rabbi in 1876 and was appointed to the rabbinate of
          Szegedin. In the following year, however, the Hungarian
          government chose him to be one of the professors of the new
          Landesrabbinerschule at Budapest, where he has since taught on a
          great variety of subjects. In 1878 he was a field-chaplain in
          the Austro-Hungarian army of occupation in Bosnia. Seven years
          later he was appointed director of the Talmud Torah school in
          Budapest, an institution with which he is still connected. In
          1894 he was one of the founders of the Jewish literary society
          Izraelita Magyar Jrodami Társulat, of which he was elected
          vice-president four years later. His chief works, in addition to
          numerous contributions to scientific periodicals and various
          encyclopedias, are Nizâmi's Leben und Werke, und der zweite
          Theil des Nizâmi'schen Alexanderbuches (Leipsic, 1871);

          (1900); and Aus dem Wörterbuch Tanchum Jeruschalmi's (1903). In
          1884 he and Joseph Bánóczi founded the Magyar Zsidó Szemle,
          which they edited for seven years, and which is still the only
          Jewish review in Hungary.

   Bachmann, Johannes Franz Julius
          BACHMANN, JOHANNES FRANZ JULIUS: Lutheran; b. at Berlin Feb. 24,
          1832; d. at Rostock Apr. 12, 1888. He studied at Halle and
          Berlin, became privat-docent at Berlin, 1856, ordinary professor
          of theology at Rostock, 1858, also university preacher, 1874. In
          his student days Tholuck and Hengstenberg attracted him most,
          and it was in large measure the learning, ingenuity, and
          firmness of the latter in defending tradition which influenced
          Bachmann to devote himself especially to the investigation of
          the Old Testament. His theological position may be thus
          characterised: The conception of prophecy seemed to him
          determined by the mode of its fulfilment; for this reason he
          believed that the spiritual, not the literal, exposition of the
          Old Testament should be followed. Nevertheless, he tried to
          avoid the one-sided spiritualism which Hengstenberg espoused in
          his earlier works. His scholarship in his chosen field is
          evident in two works, Die Festgesetze des Pentateuchs aufs neue
          kritisch untersucht (Berlin, 1858), in which he endeavors to
          prove, against Hupfeld, the harmonious unity of the festival
          laws of the Pentateuch; and in his unfinished commentary on the
          Book of Judges (Berlin, 1868), upon which he had spent years of
          labor. Of this work George F. Moore remarks (Commentary on
          Judges, New York, 1895, 1): "By far the fullest recent
          commentary on Judges is that of J. Bachmann, which was
          unfortunately never carried beyond the fifth chapter. The
          author's standpoint is that of Hengstenberg, and he is a stanch
          opponent of modern criticism of every shade and school; but in
          range and accuracy of scholarship, and exhaustive thoroughness
          of treatment, his volume stands without a rival." Bachmann also
          wrote with reverence and learning a biography of his teacher
          Hengstenberg (2 vols., Gütersloh, 1876-80).

   Bacon, Francis

BACON, FRANCIS

  Life.

          English philosopher and statesman; b. in London Jan. 22, 1561,
          son of Sir Nicholas Bacon (b. 1509; d. 1579), Lord Keeper of the
          Great Seal under Elizabeth; d. at Highgate, near London, Apr. 9,
          1626. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge, 1573-75, and in
          1576 was admitted to Gray's Inn. He entered parliament in 1584,
          became one of the leading lawyers of England, and rose through
          various posts in the public service until he reached the Lord
          Chancellorship in 1618. The same year he was raised to the
          peerage as Baron Verulam, and three years later was made
          Viscount St. Albans. In 1621 he was charged with accepting
          bribes, and was tried and found guilty; his offices were taken
          from him, he was sentenced to a fine of £40,000, to imprisonment
          during the king's pleasure, and was disabled from sitting in
          parliament and coming within twelve miles of the court. Feeling
          his disgrace keenly, he went into retirement and devoted the
          remainder of his life to study and literary work. The
          parliamentary sentence, however, was not imposed, for the king
          (James I) practically remitted his fine and in 1622 he was
          allowed to come to London.

  Bacon's Philosophy.

          As philosopher and man of letters Bacon's fame is in bright
          contrast to his sad failure in public life. His philosophy is
          contained chiefly in the various parts and fragments of a work
          which he called Instauratio magna and which he left incomplete;
          the most important part is the Novum organum (published 1620).
          His philosophy is a method rather than a system; but the
          influence of this method in the development of British thought
          can hardly be overestimated. As Luther was the reformer of
          religion, so Bacon was the reformer of philosophy. Luther had
          claimed that the Scripture was to be interpreted by private
          judgment, not by authority. The problem of Bacon was to suggest
          a method of interpreting nature. The old method afforded no
          fruits. It "flies from the senses and particulars" to the most
          general laws, and then applies deduction. This is the
          "anticipation of nature." To it Bacon opposes the
          "interpretation of nature." Nature is to be interpreted, not by
          the use of the deductive syllogism, but by the induction of
          facts, by a gradual ascent from facts, through intermediate laws
          called "axioms," to the forms of nature. Before beginning this
          induction, the inquirer is to free his mind from certain false
          notions or tendencies which distort the truth. These are called
          "Idols" (idola), and are of four kinds: "Idols of the Tribe"
          (idola tribus), which are common to the race; "Idols of the Den"
          (idola specus), which are peculiar to the individual; "Idols of
          the Marketplace" (idola fori), coming from the misuse of
          language; and "Idols of the Theater" (idola theatri), which
          result from an abuse of authority. The end of induction is the
          discovery of forms, the ways in which natural phenomena occur,
          the causes from which they proceed. Nature is not to be
          interpreted by a search after final causes. "Nature to be
          commanded must be obeyed." Philosophy will then be fruitful.
          Faith is shown by works. Philosophy is to be known by fruits.

  Ethics.

          In the application of this method in the physical and moral
          world, Bacon himself accomplished but little. His system of
          morals, if system it may be called, is to be gathered from the
          seventh and eighth books of his De augmentis scientiarum (1623;
          a translation into Latin and expansion of an earlier English
          work; the Advancement of Learning, 1605), and from his Essays
          (first ed., 10 essays, 1597; ed. with 38 essays, 1612; final
          ed., 58 essays, 1625). Moral action means action of the human
          will. The will is governed by reason. Its spur is the passions.
          The moral object of the will is the good. Bacon, like the
          ancient moralists, failed to distinguish between the good and
          the right. He finds fault with the Greek and Roman thinkers for
          disputing about the chief good. It is a question of religion,
          not of ethics. His moral doctrine has reference exclusively to
          this world. Duty is only that which one owes to the community.
          Duty to God is an affair of religion. The cultivation of the
          will in the direction of the good is accomplished by the
          formation of a habit. For this Bacon lays down certain precepts.
          No general rules can be made for moral action under all
          circumstances. The characters of men differ as their bodies
          differ.

  Relation Between Philosophy and Religion.

          Bacon separates distinctly religion and philosophy. The one is
          not incompatible with the other; for "a little philosophy
          inclineth man's mind to atheism, but depth in philosophy
          bringeth men's minds about to religion." Bacon has been
          sometimes regarded as a defender of unbelief, because he opposed
          the search after final causes in the interpretation of nature.
          But it is one thing to discourage the search after final causes
          in science, it is another thing to deny the existence of final
          causes. "I had rather believe," he says, "all the fables in the
          Legend and the Talmud and the Alcoran than that this universal
          frame is without a mind" (Essay on Atheism). The object of
          scientific inquiry should be the "form," not the final cause.

          While philosophy is not atheistic it does not inform religion.
          Tertullian, Pascal, and Bacon agree in proclaiming the
          separation of the two domains. Tertullian and Pascal do it to
          save religion from rationalism; Bacon does it to save philosophy
          from the "Idols." Credo quia absurdum is expressed in the
          following words: "But that faith which was accounted to Abraham
          for righteousness was of such a nature that Sarah laughed at it,
          who therein was an image of natural reason. The more discordant,
          therefore, and incredible, the divine mystery is, the more honor
          is shown to God in believing it, and the nobler is the victory
          of faith" (De augmentis, bk. ix). Religion comes, therefore, not
          from the light of nature, but from that of revelation. "First he
          breathed light upon the face of the matter, or chaos, then he
          breathed light into the face of man, and still he breatheth and
          inspireth light into the face of his chosen" (Essay on Truth).
          One may employ reason to separate revealed from natural truth,
          and to draw inferences from the former; but we must not go to
          excess by inquiring too curiously into divine mysteries, nor
          attach the same authority to inferences as to principles. If
          Bacon was an atheist, as some claim, his writings are certainly
          not atheistic. He must, in that case, have been a hypocrite in
          order to be a flatterer, and, if a flatterer, a most foolish
          one. Yet the inductive method has given natural theology the
          facts which point most significantly to God.

          Bibliography: Bacon's religious works are thus enumerated by
          Prof. Thomas Fowler: (1) the Meditationes sacroe (published with
          the Essays, 1597); (2) A Confession of Faith (written before
          1603, published 1648); (3) a Translation of Certain Psalms into
          English Verse (composed during a fit of sickness 1624, published
          1625); (4) three prayers, The Student's Prayer, The Writer's
          Prayer, and a third composed during his troubles (1621). The
          most complete and best edition of Bacon's Works is by J.
          Spedding, R. L. Ellis, and D. D. Heath, 7 vols., London,
          1857-59, new ed., 1870, which is supplemented by Spedding's
          Letters and Life, 7 vols., 1861-74; abridged ed., 2 vols., 1878.
          Of numerous editions of special works, mention may be made of

          BACON, LEONARD: Congregationalist; b. in Detroit, Mich., Feb.
          19, 1802; d. in New Haven, Conn., Dec. 24, 1881. He was
          graduated at Yale in 1820, studied theology at Andover, became
          pastor of the First (Center) Church in New Haven in 1825, and
          retained his connection with the church during his life, after
          1866 as pastor emeritus. He was instructor in revealed religion
          in the Yale Divinity School, 1866-71, and lecturer on church
          polity and American church history, 1871 till his death. He was
          one of the founders and early editors of The New Englander
          (1843) and of The New York Independent (1848). His published
          books include a life and selections from the works of Richard
          Baxter (2 vols., New Haven, 1830); Thirteen Historical
          Discourses on the Completion of Two Hundred Years from the
          Beginning of the First Church in New Haven (1839); Slavery
          Discussed in Occasional Essays from 1833 to 1846 (New York,
          1846); The Genesis of the New England Churches (1874). He
          possessed a marked individuality of character and was an able
          and influential leader in his denomination. He was prominent in
          the slavery contest, and was a prolific writer and frequent
          speaker upon all topics of social and political reform.

          Conn., Jan. 1, 1830; d. at Assonet, Mass., May 12, 1907. He was
          educated at Yale (B.A., 1850); he studied theology at Andover
          and Yale (1854), and medicine at Yale (M.D., 1855). He was
          pastor of St. Peter's Presbyterian Church, Rochester, N. Y., in
          1856-57 and of the Congregational Church at Litchfield, Conn.,
          in 1857-60. He was missionary at large for Connecticut in
          1861-62, and then held successive pastorates at Stamford, Conn.
          (1863-65), Brooklyn, N. Y. (1865-70), and Baltimore, Md.
          (1871-72). From 1872 to 1877 he was in Europe, and after his
          return to the United States was pastor at Norwich, Conn.
          (1878-82), Philadelphia (1883-86), and Augusta, Ga. (1886-88). .
          Since 1901 he has been pastor of the Congregational Church at
          Assonet, Mass. He has edited Congregational Hymn and Tune Book
          (New Haven, 1857); The Book of Worship (New York, 1865); The
          Life, Speeches, and Discourses of Father Hyacinthe (1872); The
          Hymns of Martin Luther Set to their Original Melodies, with an
          English Version (1883); and The Church Book: Hymns and Tunes
          (1883). He has also written The Vatican Council (New York,
          1872); Church Papers: Essays on Subjects Ecclesiastical and
          Social (1876); The Simplicity that Is in Christ (1885); Irenics
          and Polemics (1898); History of American Christianity (1898);
          and Story of the Congregationalists (1904).

   Bacon, Roger
          BACON (BACO), ROGER: The famous Franciscan theologian, called
          doctor mirabilis; b. at or near Ilchester (31 m. s. of Bristol),
          Somersetshire, 1214; d. at Oxford June 11, 1294. He studied
          first at Oxford, then at Paris, where he took the degree of
          doctor of holy scripture in 1248 and joined the order of St.
          Francis, probably immediately after receiving his degree. In
          taking this step, he followed, it is said, the advice of the
          famous bishop of Lincoln, [852]Robert Grosseteste; but it is
          more probable that his countryman Adam of Marsh (de Morisco)
          from Bath, himself a Franciscan and professor of philosophy at
          Oxford (d. about 1260), induced him to join that order (cf. J.
          Felten, Robert Grosseteste, Freiburg, 1887, 94 sqq.). Bacon now
          taught in Oxford and Paris, though it can not be stated how long
          he stayed in either place.

  Suspected and Persecuted as a Magician.

          On account of his deep insight into the realm of natural
          science, which was then little known, and because of the
          astonishing effects which his physical experiments produced upon
          pupils and other contemporaries, he was suspected of being a
          "magician" and astrologer, busying himself with illicit arts.
          Some accidental remarks of his on the influence of the stars
          upon human destiny may have furnished occasion for this surmise.
          There is no doubt that he was himself the scholar of whom he
          narrates that he was fined for making a burning-glass (Op. maj.,
          iii, 116). The many vexations which he experienced, especially
          at the hands of the friars, induced him to write to Pope Clement
          IV (formerly Guido Foulques), who as cardinal-legate in France
          and England had shown a friendly disposition toward him. Clement
          answered from Viterbo (Aug. 22, 1266) in a kindly manner, and
          requested Bacon to send some of his works. Accordingly he sent
          his Opus majus to Rome, and between 1266 and 1268 also the Opus
          minus and Opus tertium. A pupil of Bacon, the London magister
          John, seems to have taken an important part at that time in
          interpreting these works to the pope, and probably also produced
          and explained some instruments made by his teacher. The first
          investigation was favorable to the genial scholar, but a renewed
          charge which was brought against him by the general of the
          Franciscans, Jerome of Ascoli, during the pontificate of
          Nicholas III (1277-81), especially on account of the treatise De
          vera astronomia, ended with Bacon's imprisonment in a monastery
          either in Paris or at some other place in France. Ten years he
          thus spent behind the walls, but when Jerome had become Pope
          Nicholas IV, Bacon obtained his liberty through the
          recommendation of influential friends and was permitted to
          return to England.

  Anticipation of Modern Methods and Discoveries.

          Bacon belongs to those scientists of the Middle Ages who
          approached modern methods. On this account he criticizes sharply
          the scholastic method of instruction. In his Compendium studii
          philosophioe he speaks disparagingly of Aristotle, Albert the
          Great, and Thomas Aquinas, whose "boyish" learning and effort he
          censures, also of the great Franciscan theologian Alexander of
          Hales. The attacks upon the latter explain in part the
          hostilities which he experienced from his fellow friars. In the
          Opus majus (treating in six sections "of the hindrances of
          philosophy; of the relation between theology and philosophy; of
          the study of languages; of mathematics; of optics; of
          experimental knowledge") his decidedly antischolastic standpoint
          is also evident. No less do we find this in his Opus minus,
          which endeavors to reproduce the contents of the Opus principale
          in an abbreviated form, and in the Opus tertium, in which the
          principal theses of both works are reproduced in a more
          aphoristic form (clothed in a more elegant diction to make their
          understanding easier and more acceptable to his papal protector
          Clement IV). In his theological works, of which two only have
          been preserved, Bacon also appears as representative of an
          antischolastic tendency. The Epistola de laude Scripturoe Sacroe
          (ed. Wharton, in Ussher's Historia dogmatica de Scripturis,
          London, 1699) is permeated by a reformatory spirit. He
          emphasizes the sentence: Tota scientia in Bibliis contenta est
          principaliter et fontaliter; he insists upon the reading of the
          Bible in the original (and, if possible, also by the laity); he
          emphasizes in a critical spirit the need of correcting the
          Vulgate and cautions against the implicit confidence of the
          expositors in the authority of the Church Fathers. In the last
          of his works, the Compendium studii theologici (composed in
          1292), he appears rather as a representative of church
          tradition, and denounces the "gross errors" of a Parisian
          theologian, the sententiarian Richardus Cornubiensis. The
          advanced character of his theological thought and teaching is
          evident also in his works on natural philosophy; for example, he
          speaks in the Opus minus of the "seven principal sins" in
          theological study, including the neglect of the original
          languages of the Holy Scripture, the corruption of the
          traditional text, and the wrong confidence in the authority of
          the Fathers. With regard to the future progress and triumphs of
          natural science, Bacon, in bold anticipation, foresaw and
          predicted many things, which assure to him the repute of a
          prophet, just as he discovered the principles of the telescope
          and microscope, was able to outline the laws of refraction and
          reflection, and penetrated more deeply into the laws of
          cosmology than any other scholar of the Middle Ages. His proofs
          that the Julian calendar needed correction, and the ways and
          means which he indicated to accomplish this end, and for which
          he was praised by Copernicus, must also be mentioned.

  Writings.

          Of Bacon's writings the most are philosophical, or rather
          physical. The most important works of this class, especially the
          Opus majus, remained in manuscript till toward the end of the
          eighteenth century. The Opera chemica Rogeri Baconis, which was
          published in folio in 1485, was followed by a few minor writings
          pertaining to alchemy and mathematics. Of these the most
          interesting is the tractate on the secret powers of art and
          nature (first published at Paris, 1541, under the title, De
          mirabili potestate artis et naturoe; often issued since the
          beginning of the seventeenth century with the title: De secretis
          operibus artis et naturcoe). His principal work, Opus majus ad
          Clementem IV, was first published in the eighteenth century by
          Samuel Jebb (London, 1733), and not before 1859 were his
          philosophical and physical works, which supplement his main
          work, issued (Fr. R. Baconis opera quoedam hactenus inedita,
          scil. Opus tertium, Opus minus, Compendium studii philosophioe,
          De nullitate magioe, De secretis naturoe operibus, ed. J. F.
          Brewer, Rolls Series, No. 15). Two other works followed this
          publication: the tractate De philosophia morali, which Bacon
          composed as part vii of his Opus majus (Dublin, 1860), and De
          multiplicatione specierum, which was published in 1897 as an
          addition to J. H. Bridges's new edition of the Opus majus (The
          Opus majus of R. Bacon, edited with introduction and analytical
          table, 2 vols., Oxford, 1897), which gives for the first time
          the complete text, including also the seventh part, of
          moral-philosophical contents. His Greek Grammar and a Fragment
          of his Hebrew Grammar, edited from the manuscript, with notes by
          E. Nolan and S. A. Hirsch, appeared in 1902 (London), and a
          Greek tragedy was first published in the same year by the
          Cambridge press. In manuscript are still the Computus naturalium
          (3 books pertaining to the calendar and chronology), the
          Communia naturalium, and the Communia, mathematica.

   Baden
          BADEN, b??´den: A grand duchy in the south-western part of the
          German Empire, bounded on the north by Hesse and Bavaria, on the
          east by Württemberg and Hohenzollern, on the south and west by
          the Rhine, which separates it from Switzerland, Alsace, and the
          Rhine Palatinate (Rhenish Bavaria); area, 5,281 square miles;
          population (1900), 1,867,944, of whom 1,131,639 (60.6%) are
          Roman Catholics; 704,058 (37.7%), Evangelical Protestants,
          partly Lutherans, and including some of the Reformed communion,
          especially near the Swiss border, and several flourishing
          Methodist congregations, which have received help from America;
          5,563, other Christians; 26,132 (1.4%), Jews; and 552, otherwise
          classified. In late years, owing to immigration and emigration,
          the number of Roman Catholics has decreased, while that of
          Protestants has increased.

          In the eye of the law the Evangelical and Roman Catholic
          Churches are public corporations with the right of holding
          public divine services. Other bodies are restricted to
          privileges specially granted. Congregations manage their own
          affairs and the right of patronage is unknown. Ecclesiastical
          property is administered by Church and State jointly. No
          religious order can be introduced without consent of the
          government. Invested funds for the benefit of the sick and the
          poor, as well as for education, have generally been withdrawn
          from ecclesiastical boards.

          The Evangelical Protestant Established Church is a union of
          diverse elements, consequent upon territorial changes,
          accomplished in 1821. As now constituted the grand duke is at
          the head. All permanent residents of a parish are regarded as
          members of the congregation, and the active members choose a
          representative committee, which has a voice in the selection of
          the pastor and important financial questions, and selects the
          Church Council. The latter with the pastor has the general
          charge of the congregation. Congregations are united into
          dioceses, and diocesan synods; consisting of all pastors and an
          equal number of elders meet yearly. Diocesan affairs are in the
          hands of a dean and a diocesan committee of two clerical and two
          lay members elected by the synod. A general synod meets every
          five years; it consists of the Prelate, seven members named by
          the grand duke, and one clerical and one lay delegate from each
          synod. It cooperates in ecclesiastical legislation, approves the
          church budget, has the right of complaint against the Upper
          Church Council, and chooses a synodal committee to work with the
          latter. The Upper Church Council is appointed by the grand duke.
          Church revenues are supplemented, when necessary, by taxation,
          equal sums being appropriated for the Evangelical and Roman
          Catholic Churches, although the latter has declined such aid
          under the condition imposed binding the bishop to accept all
          laws and ordinances of the State. Ministers receive salaries
          ranging from 1,600 to 4,000 marks, graded according to years of
          service. Religious instruction is obligatory in all schools and
          a (Protestant) theological faculty is maintained at Heidelberg.

          The Roman Catholic Church of Baden belongs to the province of
          the Upper Rhine and forms the archbishopric of Freiburg. The
          relations between Church and State, particularly the questions
          of the position of the bishops, the appointment of priests, the
          maintenance of independent Roman Catholic schools, the right of
          establishing religious societies and institutions, and the
          management of church property, have been in almost continual
          dispute between the government and the curia, and protracted
          negotiations have not led to a permanent settlement.

   Baden (Im Aargau), Conference of
          BADEN (IM AARGAU), CONFERENCE OF: An early attempt to check the
          Reformation in Switzerland. It met at Baden in Aargau, May 21,
          1526, and closed June 8. The assembly was large and brilliant,
          the cities, with the exception of Zurich, having very generally
          sent their delegates and theologians. The chief speakers for the
          Reformation were OEcolampadius and Berthold Haller; for the
          Roman Catholics Eck, Faber, and Murner. The entire conduct of
          the assembly was in the hands of the opponents of the
          Reformation and its decision against the latter was a foregone
          conclusion. Its decrees, however, had little influence on the
          popular mind, and indiscreet efforts to give them practical
          effect brought them still further into disfavor. The acts were
          published by Murner (Lucerne, 1527).

   Bader, Johann
          BADER, b??´der, JOHANN: Leader of the Reformation at Landau in
          the Palatinate (18 m. n.w. of Carlsruhe); b., probably, at
          Zweibrücken (50 m. w. of Speyer), Rhenish Bavaria, about 1470;
          d. at Landau shortly before Aug. 16, 1545. Of his early years
          almost nothing is known. He seems to have studied at Heidelberg
          in 1486 and succeeding years and then appears as chaplain in
          Zweibrücken, where he was also tutor to Duke Ludwig (b. 1502).
          In 1518 Bader was called as minister to Landau, where he labored
          till his death. From 1522 he openly opposed Roman abuses and
          especially auricular confession. Called to appear before the
          spiritual court at Speyer, he followed the summons and, after
          many proceedings, was bidden, July 17, 1523, to preach in future
          the holy gospel only and to obey the imperial mandates. As he
          believed that he had been preaching the pure gospel, he did not
          feel called upon to change his former manner, and, upheld by the
          confidence of his congregation, he opposed the teachings of the
          Church the more, and openly attacked the doctrine of purgatory,
          mass for the dead, invocation of the saints, monastic vows, and
          fasts. For this he was again summoned to Speyer, Mar. 10, 1524.
          His proposal, to prove his teachings from the New Testament, was
          rejected, and he was excommunicated. Not in the least
          intimidated, he appealed to a future council, published his
          appeal with all the documents, and, supported by the
          city-council, steadfastly continued his reformatory work. He
          devoted great care to the instruction of the youth, and
          assembled the "young people" of the city and instructed them in
          the Christian faith. About Easter, 1526, he published his
          Gesprächsbüchlein, which may be regarded as the oldest
          evangelical catechism. In this he gives an exposition of the
          Lord's Prayer, the Apostles' Creed, the doctrine of baptism, and
          the ten commandments. In 1527 he opposed the Anabaptists, but
          afterward he was strongly influenced by Schwenckfeld, as appears
          especially in his Katechismus published in 1544, a new edition
          of his earlier work, containing a treatment of the Lord's Supper
          not found in the Gesprächsbüchlein. He states that where the
          principal requisite for a true celebration of the Lord's
          Supper--a church of true believers--is lacking, it is better not
          to celebrate. And indeed, after 1541, Bader could no more be
          induced to celebrate the Lord's Supper at Landau, because he did
          not regard the congregation there as sufficiently holy.

          Dallmin (a village near Perleberg, 77 m. n.w. of Berlin) July 3,
          1840. He was educated at the universities of Bonn and Halle from
          1859 to 1862 (Ph.D., Jena, 1864), and after passing his
          theological examinations in 1862 and 1865, being at the same
          time a private tutor, was a teacher in a real-school in Halle
          from 1863 to 1868. Since the latter year he has been pastor of
          the Reglerkirche in Erfurt, where he is also superintendent and
          senior of the Evangelical Ministerium, as well as a member of
          the local academy of sciences since 1891, being likewise a
          member of its senate since 1905. He has been, moreover, a member
          of the governing board of the Evangelischer Bund since its
          establishment in 1886, and is a member of the synodical council
          of the Prussian General Synod, besides being president of
          several ecclesiastical committees. He is a mediating theologian,
          and an advocate of the "modern theology of the ancient faith."
          He has written Luther in Erfurt (Erfurt, 1868); Ueber den
          religiösen Wert von Reuters "Ut min Stromtid" (1876); and Im

          theologian; b. at Lachem (a village near Hameln, 25 m. s.w. of
          Hanover) Jan. 16, 1849; d. at Rohrbach (a village near
          Heidelberg) Sept. 6, 1905. He studied at Göttingen and Kiel, and

          After a priesthood of twenty years he was consecrated Roman
          Catholic bishop of Nottingham by Archbishop Manning (Nov. 12,
          1874), but resigned in 1901. In the following year he was
          appointed titular bishop of Hypæpa, and in 1904 was elevated to
          the titular archdiocese of Seleucia Trachea. In addition to a
          number of briefer pamphlets, he has written Notes on Christian
          Doctrine (London, 1896; originally a series of lectures
          delivered before the Hammersmith Training College for Teachers);
          The Breviary Hymns and Missal Sequences in English Verse (1900);

   Bahrdt, Karl Friedrich
          BAHRDT, b??rt, KARL FRIEDRICH: A caricature of the vulgar
          rationalism of the eighteenth century; born at Bischofswerda (20
          miles e.n.e. of Dresden), Saxony, August 25, 1741; died at Halle
          April 23, 1792. He was the son of a Lutheran pastor who
          afterward became professor at Leipsic, and commenced his studies
          at Leipsic when quite young. In spite of his many pranks he was
          promoted as magister and appointed catechist at St. Peter's.
          Being devoted to Biblico-exegetical studies under the influence
          of the learned Ernesti, he was made extraordinary professor in
          Biblical philology 1766, but was dismissed in 1768 for immoral
          life. At the same time he abandoned the orthodox standpoint,
          which he probably never had held seriously. From now on his life
          is that of a dissolute adventurer. He appears first at Erfurt,
          afterward at Giessen (1771), where he managed to obtain a
          theological professorship. Here he published (1772) a silly
          "Musterrevision" of the Bible, entitled Neueste Offenbarungen
          Gottes in Briefen und Erzählungen, which even Goethe ridiculed
          (in his Prolog zu den neuesten Offenbarungen Gottes). The
          enlightener was dismissed from his office in Giessen in 1775. He
          then tried his luck as director of a philanthropicum in the
          Grisons, then as superintendent-general in the Palatinate,
          finally as privat-docent at Halle. That he was received here,
          was due to the liberal government of King Frederick II of
          Prussia, whose free-thinking minister of ecclesiastical affairs
          and of public instruction, Zedlitz, procured for Bahrdt the
          venia legendi. He attracted great attention, not so much by his
          lectures as by his surprisingly prolific literary productivity.
          With reckless brutality he attacked every kind of belief in
          revealed religion. His System der moralischen Religion (Berlin,
          1787) advocates open naturalism; Christ is to him the greatest
          naturalist. Having ruined his religious and moral reputation, he
          finally opened an inn in a vineyard near Halle, and thus sought
          to attract the interest of students of the university. Meanwhile
          the Prussian government had taken a different course; Frederick
          II was succeeded by the reactionary Frederick William II
          (1786-97), whose minister of worship, Wöllner, in 1788,
          endeavored to restore orthodoxy. Bahrdt did not hesitate to
          ridicule (anonymously) Wöllner's religious edict in a comedy.
          For this he was imprisoned in the fortress of Magdeburg in 1789.
          During the year which he spent here he wrote smutty stories and
          his autobiography, a mixture of falsehood, hypocrisy, and
          impudent self-abasement. In 1790 he again opened his inn, fell
          ill in 1791, and died of disease induced by a too free use of
          mercury in the attempt to effect a self cure. In Halle the
          report was spread that he died of an unclean disease. Highly
          gifted, Bahrdt never yielded to moral discipline, and thus sunk
          into the deepest baseness; in his later years he seems to have
          lost every trace of decency; the flood of writings which he sent
          out into the world is altogether worthless; he is in every
          respect merely a representative of a wholly demoralized
          rationalism.

   Baier, Johann Wilhelm

   Baier, Johann Wilhelm
          BAIER, b?i´er, JOHANN WILHELM: Lutheran theologian of the
          seventeenth century; born at Nuremberg November 11, 1647; died
          at Weimar October 19, 1695. He studied philology, especially
          Oriental, and philosophy at Altdorf from 1664 to 1669, in which
          year he went to Jena and became a disciple of the celebrated
          Musæus, the representative of the middle party in the
          syncretistic controversy, whose daughter he married in 1674.
          Taking his doctor's degree the same year, he became in 1675
          professor of church history in the university, and lectured with
          great success on several different branches of theology. In 1682
          he was chosen to represent the Protestant side in the
          negotiations with the papal legate Steno, bishop of Tina, for
          reunion of the Churches. He was three times rector at Jena
          before he was called by the elector Frederick III, in 1694, as
          professor and provisional rector to the new university of Halle.
          Here his devotion to strict orthodoxy brought him into conflict
          with some of his colleagues, and the pietistic movement also
          gave him trouble, so that after a year he was glad to accept the
          combined positions of chief court preacher, superintendent, and
          pastor at Weimar--which, however, he held only a few months. He
          left a name in the history of theology, especially by his
          dogmatic compendium, which still preserves the early Protestant
          traditions among High Lutherans, especially in America. The Jena
          theologians, and Musæus in particular, had been asked by Ernest
          the Pious to draw up such a work, to take the place of the
          antiquated Hutter, and Musæus urged his son-in-law to do it. The
          first edition appeared in 1686, the second, enlarged, in 1691,
          and it has been frequently reprinted since. It was commended for
          general use as a text-book by its method, its conciseness, and
          its absence of mere polemics. It was obviously, however,
          intended by its author as a vindication of the Jena theology,
          which had been sharply attacked from Wittenberg, and lay under
          some suspicion of syncretism. Its dependence upon Musæus is
          really the distinguishing feature of the book, which is largely
          a compilation from him. Baier's other works include polemical
          writings against Erbermann, a convert to Roman Catholicism and a
          Jesuit, and against the Quakers; and three other compendiums,
          published after his death (1698), one of exegetical, and one of
          moral theology, as well as one of the history of dogma. His read
          significance lies in the fact that he handed on and popularized
          the theology of Musæus; and his work was continued by Buddeus,
          whom he left at Halle as professor of moral philosophy.

   Baier, Johannes
          BAIER, JOHANNES: German Roman Catholic; b. at Hetzles (a suburb
          of Erlangen) Oct. 16, 1852. He was educated at the Lyceum of
          Bamberg and the University of Munich (D.D., 1885), and was
          ordained to the priesthood in 1877. From that year until 1882 he
          was a tutor in the archiepiscopal seminary for boys at Bamberg
          and also assistant lecturer in dogmatics at the lyceum of the
          same city, besides being assistant parish priest at Bamberg and
          Nuremberg in the summer of 1877 and at Hersbruck in 1879-80. In
          1882-86 he was a teacher of religion at the normal school at
          Bamberg, where he became Oberlehrer and tutor in the latter
          year, and where he has been professor since 1901. Since 1906 he
          has been headmaster of the same institution, and in the same
          year was made an honorary Austin friar. In theology "he belongs
          to the conservative party and is a friend of rational sound
          progress." Besides many contributions to theological and
          philosophical periodicals, and in addition to numerous poems, he

          Notts., Feb. 12, 1815. He was educated at St. John's College,
          Cambridge (B.A., 1839). He was Crosse University Scholar in 1839
          and Tyrwhitt Hebrew University Scholar, 1st class, two years
          later, while he was elected fellow of his college in 1842 and
          Hebrew lecturer in 1848. From 1850 to 1878 he was warden of St.
          Augustine's College, of which he has been honorary fellow since
          1878, and after 1863 was honorary canon of Canterbury. He was
          also rector of West Tarring, Sussex, from 1878 to 1892 and was
          rural dean of Storrington in 1886-92. He was twice appointed
          Select Preacher at Cambridge and was Proctor in Convocation in
          1886-92. Since 1888 he has been canon of St. Augustine's. He has
          written Rituale Anglo-Catholicum (London, 1847); Manual of
          Devotion for Clergy (1890); and Gospel of the Kingdom (1902).

          Beauvais (54 m. n.n.w. of Paris), June 13, 1649; d. in Paris
          Jan. 21, 1706. He was educated in the Seminary of Beauvais;
          became a priest 1675 and obtained a small vicarage; in 1680 he
          was appointed secretary to Lamoignon, president of the
          Parliament of Paris, and spent the rest of his life in
          unremitting devotion to study. His most important works were:
          Jugements des savants sur les principaux ouvrages et auteurs (9
          vols., Paris, 1685-86); Les vies des saints (3 vols.,
          1695-1701); Vie de Descartes (2 vols., 1691); Histoire de
          Hollande, a continuation of Grotius (4 vols., 1693). He was
          favorable to the Jansenists and has been called hypercritical. A
          monograph, De la dévotion à la Sainte Vierge et du culte qui lui
          est dû (1693) was thought to attack the doctrine and practise of
          the Church and put upon the Index, and a like fate befell the
          first and second volumes of the Vies des saints, which were said
          to contain remarks little short of slanderous. The first volume
          of the Amsterdam edition (1725) of the Jugements des savants
          contains an Abrégé of his life.

          professor of divinity there in 1642, and principal of the
          university in 1661. He was a fine scholar and took an active
          part and wrote much in all the church controversies in his time.
          His Letters and Journals (ed. David Laing, 3 vols., Edinburgh,
          1841-42, with a notice of his writings and a description of his
          life) are of great historical interest. To him we owe a graphic
          description of the Westminster Assembly of Divines, to which
          body he was sent as one of the five Scotch clergymen in 1643,
          and sat in it for three years.

          literature in the University of the City of New York, and became
          professor emeritus in 1902. He was corresponding secretary of
          the American and Foreign Christian Union in 1873-84, and was the
          first vice-president of the American Society of Church History,

   Baird Lectures
          BAIRD LECTURES:: A lectureship on a foundation established by
          Mr. James Baird (d. 1876), a wealthy Scotch ironmaster, member
          of Parliament 1851-57, who was. greatly interested in religious
          and educational affairs. While the Baird Lectures had their
          inception in 1871, their realization was made possible when in
          1873 Mr. Baird established the "Baird Trust" and gave into its
          care £500,000 to be used for aggressive Christian work. A part
          of the income of this fund provides for a series of lectures
          each year at Glasgow and also, if required, at one other of the
          Scotch university towns. Each course must consist of not fewer
          than six lectures and must be delivered by a minister of the
          Church of Scotland, who may be reappointed. Since 1883 each
          lecturer has held the position for two years with the exception
          of Rev. William Milligan, who lectured in 1891 only. The most
          noteworthy contributions are the series by Professor Robert
          Flint in 1876-77 on Theism and Anti-Theistic Theories
          (Edinburgh, 1877-79), and that by J. Marshall Lang in 1901-02 on
          The Church and its Social Mission (1902). A full list of the
          lecturers and their subjects may be found in L. H. Jordan,
          Comparative Religion (New York, 1905), pp. 565-566.

          Association and of its successor, the Foreign Evangelical
          Society, from 1835 to 1843, and continued in the service of the
          society in the United States 1843-46; from 1849 to 1855 he was
          corresponding secretary of the American and Foreign Christian
          Union and again, 1861 to his death; his ninth mission to Europe
          was made in 1861. He wrote Histoire des sociétés de tempérance
          des États-Unis d'Amérique (Paris, 1836); Religion in the United
          States of America (Glasgow, 1844); Sketches of Protestantism in

   Bajus, Michael
          BAJUS, b??´´yus, MICHAEL (MICHEL DE BAY) Theologian of Louvain;
          b. at Melin (arrondissement of Ath , 14 m. n.w. of Mons),
          Hainault, 1513; d. at Louvain Sept. 15, 1589. He was educated in
          the University of Louvain, where he became magister 1535; head
          of the Standonck college and member of the faculty of arts 1540,
          and doctor of theology 1550. When four Louvain professors were
          summoned to Trent at the reopening of the council there in 1551
          Bajus and his like-minded colleague [856]Johannes Hessels filled
          the vacancies by lecturing on the Holy Scriptures. Bajus was
          soon appointed professor in ordinary.

  The Controversy Concerning Bajus's Orthodoxy.

          Being convinced that the questions of faith which were started
          by the Reformation could not be sufficiently answered by the
          scholastic method, Bajus endeavored to found the study of
          theology more upon the Scriptures and the Fathers, especially
          upon Augustine, whose works he is said to have read nine times.
          But soon a great controversy arose, and in 1560 his opponents
          secured the condemnation by the Sorbonne of eighteen
          propositions extracted from the lectures of Bajus. Bajus
          defended himself, complained of unfair treatment, and declared
          that he was ready to submit to the holy see and the council.
          After a few years the controversy began anew caused by a number
          of dogmatic tractates, the first of which (De libero arbitrio,
          De justitia, De justificatione, and others) were published in
          the beginning of 1563, others (De meritis operum, De prima
          hominis justitia, De virtutibus impiorum, etc.) in 1564, and a
          general collection (Opuscula omnia) in 1566. Bajus's opponents
          induced the new pope, Pius V, in 1567 in the bull Ex omnibus
          affictionibus to condemn Bajus's seventy-nine propositions from
          his writings as heretical, false, auspicious, bold, scandalous,
          and offensive to pious ears, without stating, however, which of
          the propositions deserved the one or the other epithet, and
          without mention of Bajus's name. The bull, written in the usual
          form without punctuation, says: Quas quidem sententioe stricto
          coram nobis examine ponderatas quanquam nonnullae aliquo pacto
          sustineri possent in rigore et proprio verbarum sensu ab
          assertoribus intento hæreticas erroneas . . . damnamus, etc. If
          a comma be inserted after intento, as was done by the Louvain
          theologians and afterward by the Jansenists, the bull contains
          the concession that some propositions in the strict sense
          intended by the authors are perhaps permissible; but if, with
          the Jesuits, the comma is put after sustineri possent, the
          contrary meaning is imparted, that some propositions which may
          perhaps be interpreted in an orthodox sense, are nevertheless
          condemned as meant by their authors. Hence arose the later
          controversy about the comma Pianum. A papal brief (May 13, 1569)
          sustained the condemnation, and Bajus submitted and was
          absolved. In his lectures (Apr. 17, 1570) he expressed himself
          once more in the sense of his apology. The bull against him was
          now first made public. The Louvain faculty made explanations,
          which were satisfactory in form, but the majority still adhered
          to the Augustinian system. Bajus remained in his prominent
          position, and was made chancellor of the University and dean of
          the Collegiate Church of St. Peter in 1575. He founded in the
          University a Collegium Sancti Augustini, to which his nephew
          Jacob, who acted as his executor, gave the name of Collegium
          Baianum.

  His Doubtful Teachings.

          The propositions of Bajus which were attacked and condemned by
          the papal bull rest entirely on the fundamental Augustinian idea
          of the entire depravity of man through original sin, of the
          absolute moral inability of the fallen man to do good, and of
          utterly unconditional and irresistible grace. To retain and
          carry out the Augustinian idea, he believed it necessary to
          oppose the scholastic (and Tridentine) notion of the original
          state of man. He will not admit that the original nature of man
          consisted in the so-called pura natura, to which came as an
          additional gift (donum superadditum, supernaturalia dona) the
          justitia originalis, which lifts man above his nature and
          qualifies him for salvation. He thinks that the status puræ
          naturæ est impossibilis. According to Scripture, Christ first
          brought grace. From this point of view the state of fallen man
          appears as essential corruption of human nature according to the
          Augustinian presentation, which especially precludes free will
          in the sense of power of choice. Liberum arbitrium hominis non
          valet ad opposita. There exists indeed a certain freedom of
          choice with reference to things which are not under
          consideration, but no condition of religio-moral indifference.
          Finally Bajus follows Augustine as a matter of course in the
          assertion that in the justified person original sin does indeed
          not rule as concupiscence but still acts, and adopts the manet
          actu, præterit reatu. As the whole man is corrupted by sin, so
          also is all humanity.

  Relation to the Reformers.

          In all these points Bajus coincides very closely with the
          Augustinianism of the Reformers. and only in a few points does
          he make a not very successful effort to explain away certain
          harsh expressions (e.g., concerning determinism) and charge them
          to the Reformers only. But he stops far short of making the
          decided deviation which the Reformers made from Augustine with
          regard to the doctrine of justification. Grace justifies man.
          Since no man on earth can attain active perfection in this life,
          our righteousness will rest more upon the forgiveness of sins
          than upon our virtue. It is characteristic how the forgiveness
          of sins comes in here like a makeshift. Si proprie loqui
          velimus, remissio peccatorum justitia non erit, quia justitia
          proprie legis obedientia est sive intus in voluntate sive foris
          in opere. . . . Sed in scripturis sacris peccatorum remissio
          ideo etiam nomine justitiæ intelligitur, quia licet proprie non
          sit, tamen apud deum pro justitia reputatur. Justification means
          to make righteous and have forgiveness of sins; but it is the
          former above all.

          The bull against Bajus is very instructive for the history of
          doctrinal theology, because the Augustinian theology is here
          censured with all plainness. Thus, condemnation is pronounced
          upon the following propositions: that every sin deserves
          everlasting punishment (20); that all works of the unbelievers
          are sin (25); that the will without the help of grace can only
          sin (27); that concupiscence, even where it acts unwillingly, is
          sin (51); that the sinner is not animated and moved by the
          absolving priest but only by God (58); that the merit of the
          redeemed is given to them freely (8); that temporal sins can not
          be atoned for by one's own doings de condigno, but that their
          abolition, like the resurrection, must be ascribed in a proper
          sense to the merit of Christ (77, 10).

   Balaam
          BALAAM, bê´lam: A non-Israelitic prophet or soothsayer, son of
          Beor, from Pethor (Assyrian Pitru, cf. E. Schrader, KAT, i, 38;
          F. Delitzsch, Wo lag das Paradies, Leipsic,1885, p. 269; J.
          Halévy, Mélanges d'Épigraphie et d'Archéologie Sémitiques,

          altägyptischen Denkmälern, Leipsic, 1893, p. 291), a city of
          northern Mesopotamia, not far from the Euphrates. He seems to
          have been known as a sorcerer throughout a wide region, and
          according to Num. xxii, 5 sqq., was engaged by Balak, king of
          the Moabites, to curse Israel in the name of the God whom Israel
          served. But the God in whose name Balaam practised his magical
          arts, is a living God who could interfere with and govern
          Balaam's doings. And such an interference took place when Balak
          called Balaam. By this means his divination became real
          prediction.

  The Biblical Narrative.

          Balaam, moved by desire for reward, accepted Balak's invitation,
          which aroused Yahweh's anger. That he accepted the invitation
          gladly may be seen from the anger which seized him as his animal
          suddenly shied on the way and refused to proceed. His own eyes
          were held so that he did not perceive the apparition in his
          path. He would have seen it if he had gone with the disposition
          of a prophet of Yahweh, for he would then have had an eye open
          to that which his God sent him. The irrational animal which
          carried him became the instrument to set him right. Its
          resistance changed into intelligible speech. For the animal
          spoke in the same manner as the wife of the first man heard the
          serpent speak. In neither case need one think of an act of
          divine omnipotence, granting to the speechless animal the
          momentary function of human organs of speech. The act concerned
          rather the ear of the prophet and for him the animal's plaintive
          tone became articulate utterance. The prophet could be brought
          to his senses and aroused from a mental disposition intent only
          upon gain by some thing extraordinary, which was the reason why
          the animal refused to proceed. Now he also saw the apparition
          which had startled his beast, and the horror of it made him even
          willing to turn back, still more to speak only that which should
          offer itself to him as God's word.

          After Balaam had arrived in the mountainous part of Moab, near
          the sources of the Amon between the Amon and the Jabbok, Balak,
          after offering sacrifices to predispose Yahweh in his favor,
          three times assigned to Balaam a station (Num. xxii, 41; xxiii,
          14, 28), that from the high place he might curse Israel which
          was encamped before his eye. But three times, overcome by
          Yahweh's spirit, the prophet blessed the people (Num. xxiii,
          7-10; 18-24; xxiv, 3-9), first giving the reason which made it
          impossible for him to curse Israel, viz., that it differed
          entirely from other nations, being richly favored by God; he
          then expanded the blessing briefly indicated in this first
          parable, and in a third deliverance finally described the
          glorious prosperity of Israel and its dominion as well as the
          fearful power of this people which should crush all enemies,
          having been set for a curse and a blessing to the nations. Balak
          was greatly enraged and dismissed the seer who, according to
          Num. xxiv, 15-24, spoke to the king more fully of the future
          which awaited Israel during its rule, and of the mighty
          commotions which should destroy nations. Under the figure of a
          star and scepter he sees in the distant future a king coming
          forth from Israel, whose glorious power none may resist, and the
          ruin of the world-powers one after the other and one through the
          other.

  Significance of Balaam's Prophecies.

          It can not be denied that there is something strange in Balaam's
          utterances foretelling world-historical events to a remote
          future. But to have recourse to the expedient that we have here
          a prophecy after the event, or that the originally transmitted
          prophecy of Balaam has been enlarged in later time in accordance
          with the course of history, is to deprive Balaam's whole
          appearance of its essential meaning in connection with Old
          Testament prophecy. Balaam's importance consists in just this,
          that from the time when Israel first appeared among the nations,
          the future of the nations and world-powers was disclosed not to
          one of its own prophets but to one outside of it. And the
          knowledge of the history of future centuries which was there
          communicated to the people served to comfort them in the midst
          of threatening world-movements till Daniel's revelations came
          and continued the knowledge of the future from the point where
          Balaam left it. The great importance of Balaam's prophecy finds
          its expression also in this, that whenever the Israelitic
          prophets of later times speak of the relations of Israel to the
          world-nations, we hear his words ringing through their
          utterances. As a matter of course, this reference of the origin
          of the oracles of Balaam to Mosaic times applies only to the
          essential contents, not to the form of expression as it now
          exists. The latter must be attributed to the narrator.

          Balaam's condemnation in the New Testament (II Pet. ii, 15-16;
          Rev. ii, 14) is founded upon the notice Num. xxxi, 16, according
          to which he advised Balak to seduce Israel to the sensual cultus
          of Baal-Peor. The contradiction in which this later and
          additional notice seems to stand with Num. xxiv, 25, which
          passage at the first glance every one understands to mean that
          Balaam, after his parting-word concerning Israel, returned to
          his home, is easily reconciled by the supposition that Balaam
          actually left Balak, but stayed with the Midianites, who were
          allied to the Moabites (Num. xxii, 4, 7), in order to serve
          Israel's enemies and to await the success of his plan to lead
          them astray. In the war of revenge which broke out against
          Midian (Num. xxv, 16-19), the divine punishment overtook him
          (Num. xxxi, 8; Josh. xiii, 22). His giving to the Midianites the
          advice so fatal to Israel in its consequences can be explained
          from the irritation which took hold of him when he found himself
          deprived of the reward which he desired.

          W. Volck.

          The fascinating and somewhat perplexing story of Balaam as given
          in Numbers becomes less puzzling when it is analyzed and traced
          to its sources. The whole story is an episode of the history of
          the tribes of Israel at the close of their wanderings after the
          Exodus. The main continuous narrative, as we now have it, is
          found in Num. xxii-xxiv and contains two well-defined elements:
          a prose portion or the narrative proper, and a poetical portion
          comprising four oracles uttered by the hero of the story.

  The Narrative Analyzed.

          The incidents are in brief as follows: Balak, king of Moab,
          alarmed at the numbers and strength of the Hebrews, sends for
          the noted seer and wizard, Balaam of Pethor (Assyrian Pitru) on
          the Euphrates in Mesopotamia, to bring a curse upon them. Balaam
          would not answer the messengers till he had consulted God as to
          what he should do. God at first forbade him to go; but after he
          was again approached by an embassy from Balak with greater gifts
          and more urgent appeals, he was granted permission upon the
          condition that he should utter only God's direct message (Num.
          xxii, 5-21). He at once sets out for Moab with the princes of
          the embassy, and on meeting Balak he assures him that at best he
          can act only as God's mouthpiece (Num, xxii, 35-38). Then Balak
          takes him to Bamoth-Baal EV, "the high places of Baal"), not far
          south of the Arnon. Here elaborate sacrifices were prepared,
          and, when Balaam retired for consultation, God appeared to him
          and gave him a message which foretold the greatness and
          blessedness of Israel (Num. xxii, 39-xxiii, 10). After a bitter
          remonstrance from Balak a similar transaction took place upon
          the summit of Pisgah followed by an oracle in which Israel's
          purity of worship and its valor are extolled (Num. xxiii,
          11-24). Balaam was next transferred by Balak to Peor--apparently
          another height of Nebo, commanding a specially good view of the
          Dead Sea desert (Jeshimon), where Israel was encamped. At this
          stage Balaam, instead of going into the solitude, uttered his
          oracle from immediate inspiration (as "the spirit of God came
          upon him") with a glowing description of the beauty and
          fertility of the promised land and a forecast of the military
          triumphs of Israel (Num. xxiii, 25-xxiv, 9). Finally Balak in
          anger dismisses the prophet, who without the advantages of the
          prescriptive sacrifices spontaneously delivers himself of a
          prophecy in which Israel is pictured as victorious over Moab
          itself as well as over the peoples to the south of Palestine.
          Balaam then returns to his distant home (Num. xxiv, 10-25).
          Embedded in this main narrative is the story of Balaam's being
          confronted by the angel of Yahweh, when on his way to Moab, and
          of the speaking she-ass who sees this divine messenger invisible
          to the prophet (Num. xxii, 22-34).

  Its Inconsistencies

          A reference to the last-named section may best introduce a brief
          analysis of the sources. It is evident at a glance that this
          section contradicts the preceding part of the present narrative.
          Verse 22 directly contravenes verse 20a, and verses 22 sqq.,
          which make Balsam to have traveled privately, are inconsistent
          with verse 20b (cf. verses 35 and 36, where the main story is
          resumed). Moreover, the incident of the angel and the
          clairvoyant and speaking ass is out of place and inconsequent.
          There was no occasion that Balaam should learn that it was
          useless to resist the will of Yahweh (cf. verse 32) since it was
          in accordance with the divine command that he had entered upon
          his journey. The marvel of an animal endowed with human speech
          has many parallels in folk-lore from the earliest times, and
          adds nothing to the dignity and force of the narrative but
          rather detracts from it. In fact, if chap. xxii, 22-35 be
          removed we have a consistent and instructive allegory of the
          historico-prophetic order.

  The Sources.

          This single and separate episode of the journey to Moab belongs
          to J, and the rest of the narrative in chap. xxii belongs to E.
          Chaps. xxiii and xxiv are probably the work of a redactor using
          materials from both of these great sources. More particularly,
          it is apparent that the oracles of chap. xxiii bear, on the
          whole, an Elohistic and those of chap. xxiv a Jehovistic stamp.
          In the narrative proper E predominates throughout. Indeed the
          journey episode is almost all that we have from J in the prose
          portions of the story. Hence it is now impossible to say what
          his conception was of the original attitude of Balaam toward his
          mission. The variations of the story, however, do not obscure
          the essence of it as far as it concerns the personality and
          doings of Balaam. In the remote background there appears the
          figure of a famous Aramean seer of the twelfth century B.C. who
          among the contending tribes and peoples of Palestine discerned
          special elements of greatness and power in the Hebrew tribes and
          in the religion of Yahweh, and had some prevision of their
          future, to which he gave official utterance. There is no reason
          why such a belief may not have had a foundation in fact. It must
          be remembered that the chief proximate ancestors of the Hebrews
          were Aramean (Deut. xxvi, 5), and that no small portion of the
          narrative of Genesis consists of cherished traditions of Aramean
          associations. Moreover, the twelfth century was the epoch-making
          period of emigration and travel from western Mesopotamia across
          the Euphrates and southward.

  The Oracles. Their Motive and Date.

          The oracles are of course the significant element of the Balaam
          story. Their underlying motive is to vindicate the rightful
          predominance of Israel over its rivals to the east and south. It
          is this motive which has diverted the tradition of Balaam from
          its original scope employed it to justify the remorseless border
          wars waged by southern Israel in the days of the monarchy. In
          the nature of the case the poems were composed not more than a
          very few generations after the events. Now since the oracles of
          chap. xxiii are essentially Elohistic and had their origin in
          the northern kingdom, the events which suggested them took place
          before the schism, not later than the warlike days of David.
          Indeed it is generally agreed that the subjugation of Moab and
          Edom (cf. xxiv, 17, 18), which took place in his time, formed
          the central point of practical interest for the whole series.
          The literary period of Solomon may have been the starting-point.
          But the process of enlargement and refinement in the individual
          poems must have lasted till the eighth century.

          An appendix to the oracles is found in chap. xxiv, 20-24, which
          must have been composed originally at a late date, since
          deportations by the Assyrians are referred to (verse 22), and
          perhaps also even the Macedonian conquests of the fourth century
          (verse 24). This poem should of course be separated from the
          others in our texts.

  The Story in P and Later Literature

          Quite apart from the main current of tradition and its
          idealization is the use made of the Balsam story by the priestly
          writer in Num. xxxi, 8, 16. He connects the prophet with the
          Midianitish seductions described (also by P) in Num. xxv, 6-18.
          The statement that Balaam suggested the corruption of Israel by
          sensual allurements and suffered death in the ensuing holy war,
          is out of harmony with the original conception of the prophet,
          which is retained throughout the older accounts. The notion,
          however, gained continually in popularity, and is recalled in
          the later literature even in New Testament times (cf. II Pet.
          ii, 15, Jude 11; Josephus, Ant., IV, vi, 6). Prejudice is
          already shown in Josh. xxiv, 9; Deut. xxiii, 4, 5; but a more
          just sentiment is displayed in Mic. vi, 5. A historical example
          of the influence of the tradition may be seen in Neh. xiii, 1,
          2.

          educated in the seminary at Padua, where he was appointed
          professor in 1862. He was director of the Venetian La Libertà
          Cattolica in 1865 and of the Modenese Diritto Cattolico in 1867.
          In 1879 he became subarchivist of the Vatican, but retired on
          account of ill health four years later, and has since resided at
          Pregatto in the province of Bologna. He was nominated
          chamberlain by Leo XIII in 1881, and domestic prelate in the
          following year, while in 1883 he was appointed referendary of
          the Papal "segnatura." In the latter year he was also created a

   Baldachin
          BALDACHIN: A canopy-like ornament in stone or bronze over the
          altar in some Roman Catholic churches, designed originally to
          protect the Eucharist from objects that might fall on it from
          above. The name is derived from Baldacco, an old Italian form of
          Bagdad, and owes its use in this connection to the fact that
          Bagdad was a rich source of the precious cloths which were
          frequently employed in decorating the protecting ornament over
          altars. In spite of legislation of the Congregation of Rites
          requiring a baldachin over every altar, the contrary practise is
          common everywhere at the present day, even in Rome. Formerly the
          baldachin was called a ciborium because the ciborium or vessel
          containing the Eucharist was suspended from it. A splendid
          example of the baldachin is seen in the bronze masterpiece of
          Bernini over the main altar of St. Peter's in Rome. A portable
          baldachin is held over the sacrament of the altar when it is
          borne in procession or, in some places, when it is carried to
          the sick. A baldachin should be erected also over a bishop's
          throne.

   Balde, Jakob
          BALDE, b??l´d?, JAKOB: German Jesuit, distinguished as a
          scholar, poet, and preacher; b. at Ensisheim (55 m. s.s.w. of
          Strasburg), Alsace, Jan. 4, 1604; d. at Neuburg (29 m. n.n.e. of
          Augsburg), Bavaria, Aug. 9, 1668. He was destined for a legal
          career, and was educated by the Jesuits in his native town, at
          Molsheim, and at Ingolstadt. In 1624 he renounced the world and
          entered the Society, still continuing his classical studies, and
          teaching rhetoric at Munich and Innsbruck. In 1633 he was
          ordained; from 1635 to 1637 he was professor of rhetoric in the
          University of Ingolstadt; and from 1638 to 1640, after the death
          of Jeremias Drexel, court preacher to Maximilian I in Munich.
          Here he remained as historiographer of the duchy for ten years
          longer, but won more renown by the poetical compositions of the
          years 1637-46. His work in this period was lyrical (Lyrica,
          Munich, 1638-42; Sylvæ, 1641-45), but after 1649 he turned
          rather to satire and elegy. His health forced him to leave
          Munich in 1650, and after three years at Landshut and one at
          Amberg, he settled at Neuburg on the Danube, where he spent his
          last years in the peaceful dignity of the office of chaplain to
          the count palatine Philip William. His memory, which had to a
          great extent died out, was revived at the beginning of the
          nineteenth century by Herder, Orelli, and others, and his name
          has since been increasingly honored, especially by the efforts
          of the Munich society, founded in 1868, which bears it. He well
          deserves this renown from more than one point of view. He was a
          great classical scholar, a positive reincarnation of Roman
          antiquity. As a Latin poet (his small body of vernacular work is
          far inferior) he displays a wonderful array of excellent
          qualities--vivid imagination, depth of thought and feeling,
          brilliant invention and composition, and mastery of the most
          difficult forms. The characteristic universal scholarship of his
          age is best shown in his Urania Victrix (1663), which touches
          every branch of knowledge. Besides the works already mentioned,
          and some epics belonging to his first period, his Philomela
          (1645), full of devotion to the Crucified, his Elegiæ variæ
          (1663), and his amusing satires on quack doctors and other
          impostors in Medicinæ gloria (1649) may be named.

          at the universities of Strasburg, Göttingen, and Paris, and in
          1880 was appointed supply at Strasburg. Two years later he was
          chosen assistant pastor and secretary of the editorial board of
          the Journal du Protestantisme français at Paris, where he
          remained until 1884. From 1886 to 1890 he was vicar at
          Mundolsheim (a suburb of Strasburg) and Strasburg, but in the
          latter year was appointed associate professor of New Testament
          exegesis at the University of Giessen, becoming full professor
          two years later. He was created a knight of the first class of
          the Order of Philip the Magnanimous in 1904. In addition to many
          briefer studies and his contributions to the Brunswick edition
          of the works of Calvin, he has written Das Selbstbewusstsein
          Jesu im Lichte der messianischen Hoffnung seiner Zeit

          was born at Exeter in humble circumstances, but received a good
          education; became archdeacon of Exeter, but resigned to enter
          the Cistercian monastery of Ford, Devonshire, and within a year
          was made abbot; became bishop of Worcester, 1180, archbishop of
          Canterbury, 1184. He engaged in a quarrel with the monks of
          Canterbury, and successfully asserted his preeminence among the
          bishops of England; with King Henry II he had much influence; he
          crowned Richard I in 1189, and attended him to the Holy Land the
          next year. His works (edited by B. Tissier) are in the
          Bibliotheca patrum Cisterciensium, v (Paris, 1662), from which
          they are reprinted in MPL, cciv.

   Bale, John
          BALE, JOHN: English polemical writer of the Reformation period;
          b. at Cove, near Dunwich, Suffolk (25 m. n.e. of Ipswich), Nov.
          21, 1495; d. at Canterbury Nov. 1563. He was educated in the
          Carmelite monastery at Norwich, and at Jesus College, Cambridge;
          embraced the Reformation, married, and had to seek refuge in
          Germany in 1540; returned under Edward VI, was made Bishop of
          Ossory, in Ireland, 1552, and tried to introduce reformed
          doctrines and practise with an intemperate zeal; fled to the
          Continent after the accession of Mary, and lived for some years
          at Basel; returned under Elizabeth, and was made prebendary of
          Canterbury in 1560. He wrote much and with a coarseness and
          bitterness in controversy which gained him the name of "Bilious
          Bale." His principal work is Illustrium majoris Britanniæ
          scriptorum summarium (Ipswich, 1548; enlarged editions, Basel,
          1557 and 1559); he also became noted as a writer of miracle
          plays in which he violently attacked the Roman Church. His play
          Kynge Johan has been published by the Camden Society (1838); and
          the Parker Society has published a selection of his works
          (1849), with biographical notice by H. Christmas.

   Ball, John
          BALL, JOHN: Puritan and Presbyterian; b. at Cassington (5 m.
          n.w. of Oxford) Oct. 1585; d. at Whitmore (4 m. s.w. of
          Newcastle-under-Lyme), Staffordshire, Oct. 20, 1640. He was
          educated at Brasenose College and St. Mary's Hall, Oxford, and
          in 1610 became minister at Whitmore. He was one of the fathers
          of Presbyterianism in England, and, as Richard Baxter says,
          "deserving as high esteem and honor as the best bishop in
          England." His Small Catechism containing the Principles of
          Religion (London) reached an eighteenth impression in 1637; and
          his larger catechism, entitled A Short Treatise, containing All
          the Principal Grounds of Christian Religion, a fourteenth
          impression in 1670. They were published anonymously. His
          Treatise of Faith (London, 1631; 3d edition, corrected and
          enlarged 1637, with an introduction by Richard Sibbs) is divided
          into two parts, the first showing the nature, and the second the
          life of faith. It is an exceedingly valuable and complete
          discussion. But his chief work was published after his death by
          his friend Simeon Ashe, with an introduction signed by five
          Westminster divines, entitled A Treatise of the Covenant of
          Grace (1645). This is of great importance as exhibiting that
          view of the covenants which found expression in the Westminster
          symbols. Important also is A tryall of the New-Church way in New
          England and in Old (1644). According to Thomas Blake, "his
          purpose was to speak on this subject of the covenant all that he
          had to say in all the whole body of divinity. That which he hath
          left behind gives us a taste of it." In this he anticipated
          Cocceius and the Dutch Federal Theology, but his view of the
          covenants is somewhat different from theirs. Simeon Ashe also
          issued several other works of Ball of a practical and
          controversial character.

   Ballanche, Pierre Simon
          BALLANCHE, b??´´l??nch´, PIERRE SIMON: French theocratic
          philosopher of the Restoration, an intimate member of the circle
          which gathered around Chateaubriand and Madame Récamier; b. at
          Lyons Aug. 4, 1776; d. in Paris Aug. 7, 1847. His great work,
          the Palingégésie sociale (Paris, 1830), is an attempt to
          construct the philosophy of history on the basis of revelation;
          only the first of three parts projected was completed; a
          fragment of the third part, the Vision d'Hébal (1841), attempts
          in a vague way to predict the future. Ballanche's thought was
          unsystematic and his style obscure. He was elected to the
          Academy in 1841. A collected edition of his works was begun in
          1830, but only four volumes of the nine planned appeared.

          College, Marietta, O. (1868), and Union Theological Seminary
          (1872). He studied at Leipsic in 1872-73, and in the following
          year was a member of the American Palestine Exploring
          Expedition. He was then successively professor of chemistry and
          natural science in Ripon College (1874-76), assistant professor
          of Greek in the University of Indiana (1876-78), professor of

          president of the latter institution, but resigned and studied in
          Greece until in 1897 he was appointed instructor in Bible at the
          International Y. M. C. A. Training School, Springfield, Mass. He
          was an editor of the Bibliotheca Sacra in 1884-91, and has
          written Philippians, the Model Letter (New York, 1898); Christ
          in the Gospel of Mark (1898); Inductive Bible Studies, Mark and

          BALLARD, ADDISON: Congregationalist; b. at Framingham, Mass.,
          Oct. 18, 1822. He was educated at Williams College (B.A., 1842),
          and was successively principal of Hopkins Academy, Hadley, Mass.
          (1842-43), tutor in Williams College (1843-44), and principal of
          the academy at Grand Rapids, Mich. (1845-46). In 1846-47 he was

          professor of Latin in Ohio University (1848-54), professor of
          rhetoric in Williams College (1854-55), and professor of
          mathematics, natural philosophy, and astronomy at Marietta

          First Congregational Church, Williamstown, Mass. (1857-65), the
          Congregational Church at North Adams, Mass. (1865-66; stated
          supply), and the First Congregational Church, Detroit, Mich.
          (1866-72). He was professor of Christian Greek and Latin and of
          moral philosophy and rhetoric at Lafayette College in 1874-93,
          and of logic in New York University from 1894 to 1904. He is an
          honorary member of the London Society of Science, Letters, and
          Art, and in theology is an advocate of the doctrine of
          justification by faith. He has written Arrows, or the True Aim
          in Teaching and Study (Syracuse, N. Y., 1890); From Talk to Text
          (New York, 1904); Through the Sieve (1907).

   Balle, Nicolai Edinger
          BALLE, b??l´le, NICOLAI EDINGER: Bishop of Zealand; b. at
          Vestenskov, near Nakskov (on the w. coast of the island of
          Laaland, 80 m. s.w. of Copenhagen), Denmark, Oct. 12, 1744; d.
          in Copenhagen Oct. 19, 1816. He studied at Copenhagen, Leipsic,
          Halls, and Göttingen; in 1770-71 he gave lectures at Copenhagen
          on church history and philology, and then accepted a pastorate
          in the bishopric of Aalborg; in 1772 he returned to the
          university, was made court preacher and doctor of theology in
          1774, first professor of theology in 1777, assistant to Bishop
          Harboe of Zealand in 1782, and finally his successor in 1783; he
          resigned as bishop in 1808. Balle lectured and wrote on almost
          all theological branches, but church history was his specialty,
          and in 1790 he published a Historia ecclesiæ Christianæ,
          reaching to the Reformation. His Theses theologici (1776), the
          last work on dogmatics written in Denmark in the Latin tongue,
          was used at the universities of Kiel and Wittenberg. He opposed
          rationalism and free-thinking, and when the candidate Otto
          Horrebow started a publication, Jesus og Fornuften ("Jesus and
          Reason "), Belle replied with Biblen forsvarer sig selv ("The
          Bible Defending Itself "). He introduced weekly Bible readings
          in the capital, advocated the public school, and believed in
          special training for teachers. In 1791 he published a primer,
          which contains supranaturalistic as well as rationalizing views,
          and in 1798 a new hymnbook. Both these works served their time,
          but were finally superseded on the revival of Christian and
          church life in Denmark. Balle's position among the bishops of
          Denmark is an important and honorable one. In recognition of his
          labors, the citizens of Denmark presented to him in 1798 a gold
          medal with the inscription: "To the friend of religion, to the
          friend of the State, Matt. x, 32." The pastors of Zealand
          erected a monument over his grave, and a bas-relief in the
          garrison church where he explained the Bible represents him with
          the Bible in his hand.

   Ballerini, Pietro and Girolamo
          BALLERINI, b??l´´la-rî´nî, PIETRO and GIROLAMO: Brothers, of
          Verona, distinguished by their joint labors in church history
          and canon law; b., the former, Sept. 7, 1698, the latter, Jan.
          29, 1702; d., Pietro, Mar. 28, 1769, Girolamo, Apr. 23, 1781.
          Both were educated in the Jesuits' school in Verona and became
          secular priests. Pietro for a time was at the head of the
          Accademia delle belle lettere in Verona and spent eighteen
          months in Rome (1748-50) as counselor to the Venetian ambassador
          there, during which time he made good use of exceptional
          opportunities for investigation. Both brothers devoted the
          greater part of their lives to studies in common and produced,
          with other works, editions of the Sermones of St. Zeno of Verona
          (Verona, 1739; in MPL, xi); of the Summa theologica of St.
          Antoninus of Florence (4 vols., Verona, 1740); of the Summa de
          poenitentia of St. Raymond of Pennaforte (1744); of the Opera of
          Pope Leo the Great (3 vols., Venice, 1753-57; MPL, liv-lvi), one
          of the most important pieces of editorial work of the eighteenth
          century, with an appendix on the collections of canons before
          Gratian; and of the Opera of Ratherius, Bishop of Verona
          (Verona, 1765; MPL, cxxxvi). Pietro also participated in
          literary controversies of his time and defended the absolute
          papacy with learning and zeal. His two last works, De potestate
          ecclesiastica sanctorum pontificum et conciliorum generalium
          . . . contra opus J. Febronii (1765) and De vi ac ratione
          primatus pontificum (1766), have been edited by E. W. Westhoff
          (Münster, 1845-47, and an appendix to the former on papal
          infallibility was translated into German by A. J. Binterim
          (Düsseldorf, 1843).

   Balm
          BALM: The rendering in both English versions of the Hebrew ?ori
          (Gen. xxxvii, 25 and xliii, 11, where R. V. has "mastic" in the
          margin; Jer. viii, 22; xlvi, 11; li, 8; Ezek. xxvii, 17). An
          important product of Palestine, particularly of the East-Jordan
          country, is evidently referred to, and the transparent,
          yellowish-white, fragrant gum of the mastic-tree (Pistacia
          lentiscus, L) is probably meant. Pliny mentions the Judean
          mastic (Hist. nat., xiv, 122 sqq.). The substance was prized by
          the ancients as a medicine (Pliny, xxiv, 32 sqq.). The
          identification of ?ori with balsam by Jewish tradition is not
          correct; such a tropical or sub-tropical product would hardly be
          found on the mountains of Gilead. In Song of Sol. v, 1, basam
          may be the true balsam (so R. V., margin; text and A. V.,
          "spice"; cf. "bed of spices," v, 13; vi, 2). It grew in the
          Ghor, and the balsam gardens of Jericho were famous (Josephus,
          Ant., IX, i, 2; XIV, iv, 1, and many others). Pompey is said to
          have carried it thence to Rome, and Josephus thought the Queen
          of Sheba brought it to Palestine (Ant., VIII, vi, 6; cf. I Kings
          x, 10). There are several varieties, of which the chief is the
          Amyris Gileadensis, L, the true Arabian or Mecca balsam. It is a
          low, berry-producing tree, with small blossoms, and
          imparipinnate leaves. The balsam exudes from the ends of the
          twigs. Myrrh also belongs to the balsamodendra and probably
          bdellium; see [857]Myrrh; [858]Bdellium.

          and at the University of Cervera, and was ordained priest 1833;
          became teacher of mathematics at Vich 1837. After 1840 he acted
          as associate editor of La Civilizacion and sole editor of La
          Sociedad, journals of Barcelona, in which he had opportunity to
          express his political views; visited France and England 1842,
          and after returning to Spain settled in Madrid, where from Feb.,
          1844, to Dec. 31, 1846, he published El Pensamiento de la Nacion
          in the interest of the Catholic party. He hailed the accession
          of Pius IX and the last thing he published was a brilliant work
          in his praise (Pio IX, Madrid, 1847). He gained his greatest
          fame by his Protestantismo comparado con el Catolicismo en sus
          relaciones con la civilizacion europea (4 vols., Barcelona,
          1842-44; Eng. transl., from the French, by C. J. Hanford and R.

          gymnasium of his native city and at the Reformed theological
          seminary of Debreczin (1854-58), where he remained nine years in
          various capacities. He visited Paris, London, and Edinburgh for
          the purpose of further study in 1863-65, and in 1866 was
          appointed professor of church history in the Reformed
          theological seminary of Debreczin, where he has since remained
          and of which he has been rector five times. He has been an elder
          in the session of the Reformed Church since 1860, and an
          ecclesiastical councilor for life in the Transtibiscan
          superintendency of the same religious denomination since 1883.
          He was a delegate of the Hungarian Reformed Church to the
          general councils of the Presbyterian Alliance at Edinburgh
          (1877) and London (1888), and was a member of the national synod
          of Debreczin in 1881-82. He has been a member of the committee
          of the Hungarian Protestant Literary Society since 1890, and an
          honorary member of the British and Foreign Bible Society since
          1904. In theology he is a strict adherent of the Helvetic
          Confession. His numerous works include the following in
          Hungarian: "Peter Melius, the Hungarian Calvin" (Debreczin,
          1866); "History of the Hungarian Protestant Church" (1872);
          "General Church History to the Present Time" (5 vols., 1872-90);
          "History of Dogma up to the Reformation" (1877); "Principal
          Points of Modern Theology" (1877), a polemic against the German
          Evangelical Union; "Literature of Hungarian Protestant Church
          History" (1879); "Specific Illustrations of the most Recent
          Unitarian History" (1892); "Phenomena of the History of Dogma in
          the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries" (1894); and "History of
          the Reformed College of Debreczin" (1905). He likewise wrote in
          English History of the Creeds, which appeared in the Report of
          the Proceedings of the Presbyterian Alliance (Philadelphia,
          1880), and is the author of numerous minor contributions in
          Hungarian, French, and German, while in 1875 he founded at
          Debreczin the Hungarian weekly "Evangelical Protestant Gazette,"
          which he conducted for three years in a successful crusade
          against the Budapest "Protestant Union."

          his writings is the commentary on the Nomocanon and Syntagma of
          Photius, in which he helped to make general the view that in
          matters of the Greek canon law, not the Justinian compilation,
          but the Basilica were authoritative. Balsamon's "Answers" to the
          patriarch Mark of Alexandria and his eight "Dissertations" (Gk.

   Balthazar of Dernbach and the Counterreformation In Fulda
          BALTHAZAR, bal´th?-z?r, OF DERNBACH AND THE COUNTERREFORMATION
          IN FULDA: Balthazar of Dernbach, abbot of Fulda 1570-1606, was
          born about 1548; d. at Fulda Mar. 15, 1606. He came of an old
          Hessian family, and though his parents were Protestants, took
          the Catholic side as a boy. In 1570, young as he was, he was
          elected prince-abbot of Fulda, and became the leading champion
          of the Counterreformation there. The territory under his
          jurisdiction, adjoining Protestant Hesse and Saxony, seemed
          practically lost to Rome. The chapter, jealous of its rights,
          was willing rather to join with the enemies of the Church than
          to support a strict, determined abbot; the upper classes were
          striving for both temporal and spiritual independence; the
          citizens stood by the Augsburg Confession. Balthazar took a
          decided stand against all three classes. His first task was the
          enforcement of ecclesiastical discipline, the appointment of
          Catholic officials, and the suppression of popular demands for
          the appointment of a Lutheran preacher and the erection of a
          Protestant school. He called the Jesuits to his aid; in 1571
          they started a school and the next year a college. The chapter
          were much annoyed by the privileges granted to the newcomers,
          and as a movement hostile to the abbot grew, Protestant princes
          took a hand. As selfish motives actuated the chapter and the
          gentry, so they played a part with the Landgrave of Hesse, who
          joined the Elector of Saxony and the Margrave of
          Brandenburg-Ansbach (Oct., 1573) in sending an embassy to demand
          the expulsion of the Jesuits and the abandonment of
          anti-Protestant measures. The demands did not move the abbot,
          though they strengthened his opponents; a formal alliance was
          made between the chapter and the gentry. Balthazar gained time
          by politic delays, and found support from his fellow Catholics;
          the Curia and Duke Albert of Bavaria sought to influence the
          emperor in his favor. After some hesitation, Maximilian took his
          side, and rebuked the princes (Feb., 1574) for their
          interference. Dissensions sprang up between the allies; and the
          chapter finally made peace with their abbot. He proceeded more
          diligently than ever to assert his jurisdiction and to keep down
          the new faith. In 1576 the three classes joined once more in
          opposition, and this time the chapter were willing to consider
          the deposition of their chief. Bishop Julius of Würzburg was
          destined as his successor, and justified the part he played as
          the only means of saving Roman Catholicism in the district. He
          promised religious freedom to the country gentry, while refusing
          it to the towns, and observance of all the rights, both of the
          gentry and the chapter--practically the restoration of the
          conditions previous to 1570. Balthazar was in Hammelburg,
          supervising the restoration of Catholicism there, which had been
          previously unsuccessful. On June 20 the forces of his opponents
          entered the town, followed the next day by Bishop Julius. They
          numbered about 200 horsemen, and Balthazar had made no provision
          for defense. On the 23d he was forced to abdicate; compensation
          in both money and benefices was offered to him, on condition
          that he would write to the emperor and other princes, assuring
          them that the proceedings had been freely agreed to by him. A
          few days later, Julius was formally chosen administrator of
          Fulda. But it was not possible long to conceal the real facts.
          The emperor immediately addressed a stern mandate to Julius,
          annulling the agreement, and Balthazar recalled his forced
          consent. Julius lost the support of the Roman Catholic princes
          when the facts were known, and the Protestants had little
          confidence in him. Long legal proceedings followed. The Diet of
          Regensburg provided a temporary administrator, who was, however,
          a vassal of the Bishop of Würzburg. Yet from 1579 onward
          Catholicism made steady progress, largely through the tireless
          labors of the Jesuits, which Balthazar, living at Bieberstein
          near Fulda, supported to the extent of his power. To him also
          was owing the erection of a seminary at Fulda in 1584. When,
          therefore, in 1602 the final decision was rendered in his favor,
          his return in December met with no opposition from the new
          generation, and the Counterreformation made still more rapid
          strides during the remaining four years of his activity, until
          at his death the Roman Catholic faith was restored in
          practically the whole district, with the exception of the
          country gentry. This earliest case of the successful resistance
          of a minority to the Reformation had a great importance as
          showing what could be done and inspiring the Catholic party to
          take the offensive in reconquering territory which they seemed
          to have lost.

   Baltimore Councils
          BALTIMORE COUNCILS: A name given to ten assemblies of the Roman
          Catholic Church in the United States held during the nineteenth
          century. The first independent episcopal see of the Church
          created in the American Republic was that of Baltimore (erected
          in 1790), and the same diocese was made the first metropolitan
          see of the United Staten in 1808. On account of this priority in
          point of time the archdiocese of Baltimore enjoys a
          quasiprimatial dignity conferred upon it by the pope, and hence
          that city has been the place of meeting of the various
          assemblies of the American hierarchy. The first of these
          assemblies was held under the presidency of Most Rev. James
          Whitfield, fourth archbishop of Baltimore, in Oct., 1829. This
          council and the six following ones, held respectively in 1833,
          1837, 1840, 1843, 1846, and 1849, belong to the category
          designated canonically as provincial councils; i.e., assemblies
          of all the bishops of a territory known as an ecclesiastical
          province, and presided over by the metropolitan or archbishop.
          Three other Baltimore Councils (held in 1852, 1866, and 1884)
          are called plenary or national, by which is meant an assembly of
          all the bishops of a country, convoked and presided over by the
          primate or some other dignitary commissioned thereto by the
          pope. At the time of the first council, the province of
          Baltimore was the only one in the United States, comprising,
          besides its own see, the sees of Boston, New York, Bardstown
          (Kentucky), Charleston, and Cincinnati, and only the incumbents
          of these dioceses with their coadjutors constituted the voting
          members of the council. The decrees drafted were thirty-seven in
          number, and they were confirmed by a papal rescript of Oct. 16,
          1830. They embody the earliest attempt at a uniform legislation
          in church matters in the United States, and they deal with the
          most urgent needs of a time when church forces were scattered
          and without organization. Thus, among other things, means are
          taken to regularize the credentials and the ministrations of the
          small number of available clergy, and to obviate the abuses
          arising from lay interference in ecclesiastical matters,
          particularly that known as "trusteeism." The Douai version of
          the English Bible was recommended, and various regulations were
          formulated with reference to the administration of the
          sacraments, because in the generally prevailing circumatances,
          it was impossible to carry out in full the prescriptions of the
          Roman ritual. The six succeeding councils, which continued to
          frame, as circumstances required, the local canonical
          legislation of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States,
          were similar in purpose, form of procedure, and general results.

          The First Plenary Council of Baltimore was held in May 1852, and
          was presided over by Archbishop Kenrick, who had been appointed
          to that function by Pope Pius IX. There were present six
          archbishops and twenty-four bishops with a large number of
          theologians and canonists, who acted as consultors. The decrees
          of the former councils of Baltimore were confirmed and extended
          to all parts of the country; certain enactments were made
          concerning the canonical administration of dioceses, the
          publication of marriage banns, the establishment of
          ecclesiastical seminaries, etc. The council suggested to the
          Roman authorities the erection of a metropolitan see in San
          Francisco and the establishment of ten new dioceses in various
          parts of the country. The suggestion was acted upon by Pius IX
          who confirmed the decrees of the council by a rescript dated
          Sept. 26, 1852.

          The Second Plenary Council of Baltimore was held in Oct., 1866,
          under the presidency of the Most Rev. M. J. Spalding, archbishop
          of Baltimore; there were present seven archbishops, thirty-eight
          bishops, three mitered abbots, and 120 theologians. The motives
          for calling the council and the topics discussed were in the
          main the same as those pertaining to the previous assemblies,
          but in particular it was deemed useful, "at the close of the
          great national crisis which had acted as a dissolvent upon all
          sectarian ecclesiastical organizations, to reaffirm solemnly the
          bond of union existing between the Catholics of all parts of the
          republic, and to deliberate on the measures to be adopted in
          order to meet the new phase of national life which the result of
          the war had just inaugurated." Besides, it was felt to be an
          urgent duty on the part of the heads of the Church to discuss
          the future status of the newly emancipated yet very dependent
          negro. Among the results of the council may be mentioned the
          erection of ten new dioceses and the drafting of a scheme for
          the selection of bishops, which, having been approved in Rome,
          remained in force until amended in the Third Plenary Council.

          This last and most important of the Baltimore Councils was held
          Nov. 9-Dec. 7, 1884, under the presidency of the Most Rev. James
          Gibbons, who had been appointed to that office by Pope Leo XIII.
          The number of prelates who took part in the council was fourteen
          archbishops, sixty bishops, five visiting bishops from Canada
          and Japan, seven mitered abbots, one prefect apostolic, eleven
          monsignors, eighteen vicars-general, twenty-three superiors of
          religious orders, twelve rectors of ecclesiastical seminaries,
          and ninety theologians. The object of the council was to provide
          efficient means of organization for the needs of the rapidly
          growing Church of the United States, and to prepare the way for
          the gradual introduction of the more useful elements of canon
          law into the administration of religious affairs in this
          country. The decrees of the council, which were approved by Pope
          Leo, Sept. 10, 1885, comprise eleven tituli or sections, and
          each one of these is divided into several chapters. This body of
          legislation touches successively upon the prerogatives and
          duties of bishops and the inferior members of the clergy, on
          divine worship, the administration of the sacraments, the
          training of the clergy, Catholic schools, ecclesiastical courts,
          church property, etc. Since the promulgation of these decrees in
          1885 they constitute the norm of ecclesiastical law as applied
          within the jurisdiction of the Roman Catholic Church in the
          United States.

          June 8, 1667; d. at Reims, as librarian of the college, Mar. 19,

          schools in France; became censor of books in Rome, 1717. He
          distinguished himself by a number of literary and theological
          works, of which the most important are, Réponse à l'histoire des
          oracles de M. de Fontenelle (2 vols., Strasburg, 1707; Eng.
          transl., London, 1708), in which he maintains that the ancient
          oracles were not mere frauds on the part of the priests, but
          utterances under demoniacal influence; and Défense des Saints
          Pères accusés de platonisme (Paris, 1711), in which he
          vindicates the originality of the Fathers and their complete
          independence of the ancient philosophy.

   Baluze, Etienne
          BALUZE, b??l´´lüz´, ÉTIENNE: Roman Catholic canonist and
          historian; b. at Tuile (Tutela Lemovicum, 45 m. s.s.e. of
          Limoges), in Limousin, France, Nov. 23, 1630; d. at Paris June
          28, 1718. He belonged to a family of famous jurists and studied
          first with the Jesuits at Tulle. In 1646 he was sent to
          Toulouse, where he remained till 1654, attending the
          philosophical lectures at St. Martial, the Jesuit college there.
          While still in school he showed an inclination for old
          parchments and historical documents. As his father made him
          study civil law, he could only devote himself in secret to his
          favorite studies in the library of Charles of Montchal, bishop
          of Toulouse. Exceptional acumen and persevering application made
          his critical method a safe one and he soon became known among
          the scholars of his time. His studies made it necessary for him
          to become either a monk or a priest, or to enter the service of
          some ecclesiastical dignitary. He received the tonsure and
          looked for a patron, whom he found in the successor of Montchal,
          Peter of Marca, afterward archbishop of Paris, who also showed
          him how to utilize his extensive historical studies for the
          canon and civil law. After Marca's death (1652) different
          bishops and archbishops tried to attach him to themselves. For a
          short time he remained with the Archbishop of Auch, and Le
          Tellier, the chancellor, who appointed him canon of Reims. In
          1667 the minister J. B. Colbert made him his librarian, and
          Baluze occupied this position until compelled to resign by
          advanced age after thirty-three years' service. He collected
          hundreds of documents from abbeys and monasteries and copied a
          large number. In 1707 Louis XIV appointed him inspector of the
          Collège royal, where he had been professor of canon law since
          1689. In this position he corresponded and had personal
          intercourse with scholars of different countries. A history of
          the house of Auvergne, which he edited during this time with the
          help of Cardinal Bouillon, obliged him to leave Paris after the
          flight of his ambitious protector (1710). Though eighty years of
          age, Baluze was obliged to go from place to place and finally
          settled at Orléans, where he remained till 1713. The family of
          Bouillon being received again by the king after the Peace of
          Utrecht, Baluze was able to return to Paris. Deprived of all
          means, he was obliged to devote himself entirely to literary
          activity, and he died without completing his history of Tulle.
          He wrote: Regum Francorum capitularia (1677; new edition by de
          Chiniac, 3 vols., fol., 1780); Epistolæ Innocentii papæ III
          (1682); Conciliorum nova collectio (1683, fol.); Vitæ paparum
          Avenionensium (1693); Historia Tutelensis (1717); Cypriani opera
          (1726); Bibliotheca Baluziana (1719); Miscellanea (7 vols.,
          1677-1713).

   Bamberg, Bishopric of
          BAMBERG, BISHOPRIC OF: A see founded in 1007 by King Henry II in
          the city (civitas Papinberc) which Otho II had given to Henry's
          father, Duke Henry of Bavaria, in 973. As Henry II had no
          children, his idea was to leave this possession to God, at the
          same time aiding in the final conquest of paganism in the
          district. But the territory of the Wends on the upper Main, the
          Wiesent, and the Aisch had belonged to the diocese of Würzburg
          since the organization of the Middle German bishoprics by St.
          Boniface, so that no new diocese could be erected without the
          consent of the occupant of that see. He raised no objection to
          parting with some of his territory, especially as the king
          promised to have Würzburg raised to an archbishopric and to give
          him an equivalent in Meiningen. The consent of Pope John XVII
          was obtained for this arrangement, but the elevation of Würzburg
          to an archbishopric proved impracticable, and its bishop
          withdrew his consent. The king persisted, however, and had the
          erection of the new diocese confirmed at the great Synod of
          Frankfort, subsequently naming his chancellor, Eberhard, the
          first bishop. [The next seven bishops were named by the
          emperors, after which free canonical election was the rule.
          Eberhard's immediate successor, Suidger of Morsleben, became
          pope in 1046 as Clement II. At the beginning of the thirteenth
          century the diocese gradually became a territorial principality,
          and its bishops took secular precedence next after the
          archbishops. The fortieth bishop, George III of Limburg
          (1505-22), was inclined toward the Reformation, which caused a
          violent social outbreak under his successor Weigand (1522-56),
          and the city suffered severely in the Margraves' War (1552-54),
          as well as in the Thirty Years' War, when it was placed under
          the jurisdiction of Bernard, the new Duke of Franconia. At the
          Peace of Westphalia (1648), the bishops recovered their
          possessions; but these were overrun by the French revolutionary
          armies, and in 1802 annexed to Bavaria. From 1808 to 1817 the
          diocese was vacant]; but by the Bavarian Concordat of the latter
          year it was made an archbishopric, with Würzburg, Speyer, and
          Eichstädt as suffragan sees. The present diocese comprises Upper
          Franconia and the northern half of Middle Franconia.

   Bampton Lectures
          BAMPTON LECTURES: A series of eight lectures or sermons
          instituted at the University of Oxford by the Rev. John Bampton,
          M.A., of Trinity College, Canon of Salisbury (b. 1689; d. 1751),
          who left his entire estate for the purpose. By the terms of the
          founder's will they shall be preached on Sunday mornings in
          Term, "between the commencement of the last month in Lent Term
          [the day before Palm-Sunday] and the end of the third week in
          Act Term [the day before Whitsunday--the Saturday after the
          first Tuesday in July, or later, if continued by Congregation],
          upon either of the following subjects--to confirm and establish
          the Christian Faith, and to confute all heretics and
          schismatics--upon the divine authority of the holy
          Scriptures--upon the authority of the writings of the primitive
          Fathers, as to faith and practise of the primitive Church--upon
          the Divinity of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ--upon the
          Divinity of the Holy Ghost--upon the Articles of the Christian
          Faith, as comprehended in the Apostles' and Nicene Creeds." The
          publication of the lectures is obligatory. The lecturer is
          chosen by the heads of colleges and must be at least a master of
          arts of Oxford or Cambridge; no one can be selected a second
          time. The first course was given in 1780; since 1895 lectures
          have been suspended in alternate years because of diminution in
          the income provided by the endowment fund. At present the estate
          produces £120 to each lecturer.

          A list of lecturers and subjects is given in The Historical
          Register of the University of Oxford (Oxford 1900); also, down

   Ban
          BAN: In the civil law of the old German Empire, a declaration of
          outlawry; in the twelfth century adopted by the church as the
          common name for a declaration of [861]excommunication.

   Bancroft, Richard
          BANCROFT, RICHARD: Archbishop of Canterbury; b. at Farnworth,
          Lancashire, 1544; d. in Lambeth Palace, London, Nov. 2, 1610. He
          was educated at Cambridge (B.A., 1567; D.D., 1585), was made
          rector, of Teversham, near Cambridge, 1576, and rose steadily
          till he became Bishop of London in 1597 and Archbishop of
          Canterbury in 1604. He was a High-churchman, asserting that the
          episcopal authority is based upon a divine right, and most
          violently opposed to the Puritans, whom he often attacked in his
          sermons. As president of the Convocation, he presented for
          adoption the Book of Canons now in force, and as Archbishop he
          was "the chief overseer" of the authorized version of the Bible,
          which he had opposed as a Puritan proposition at the Hampton
          Court Conference (1604). His literary remains are unimportant.

   Banes, Domingo
          BANES, b??´´nês´, DOMINGO: Spanish theologian; b. either at
          Mondragon (65 m. s.e. of Bayonne, France), Biscaya, or at
          Valladolid Feb. 28, 1528; d. at Medina del Campo Oct. 21, 1604.
          He studied at Salamanca; joined the Dominicans 1544; lectured on
          theology at Avila, Alcala, Valladolid, and Salamanca. At Avila
          he became the confessor of St. Theresa and remained her friend
          till his death. He was one of the greatest of the expounders and
          defenders of Thomism (see [862]Thomas Aquinas, Saint) and
          contributed much to the condemnation of Molina. His chief work
          was his commentary on the Summa theologiæ of Thomas Aquinas (4
          vols., Salamanca, 1584-94).

          1835. He was educated at King Edward's School, Birmingham, and,
          after being a missionary in southern India from 1856 to 1864,
          was a minister of his denomination in Plymouth, Dewsbury,
          London, Manchester, and Glasgow until 1880. Since the latter
          year he has been professor of theology in Headingley College,
          Leeds. He was president of the Wesleyan Conference in 1902, and

   Banns
          BANNS: A public announcement of an intended marriage, made in
          church during service. The word is a plural of ban, meaning an
          authoritative proclamation. The singular in the modern sense
          occurs in the fifteenth century; since then the plural only is
          found. Banns really have no connection either with the
          professiones of the early Church, alluded to by Ignatius and
          Tertullian, or with the provision made in the Carolingian
          capitulary of 802 for investigation by the clergy and seniores
          in order to avoid incestuous marriages. The public announcement
          seams to have become customary first in France, then in England
          (where the Synod of Westminster, 1200, decreed that no marriage
          should be contracted without banns thrice published in the
          church), and were prescribed for the whole Church by Innocent
          III in the Lateran Council of 1215. According to the provisions
          of the Council of Trent the proclamation must be made in the
          place of residence of both parties on three consecutive Sundays
          or feasts of obligation. The bishop may dispense from this rule,
          and in case of need the parish priest may disregard it; in any
          case its observance does not affect the validity of the
          marriage. The evangelical churches of Germany retained this
          custom, as involving investigation of possible impediments and
          intercession of the congregation for the couple, and most
          secular laws, where marriage in church is required, have also
          sanctioned it, as a preliminary to ecclesiastical marriage. [In
          the Church of England the Prayer-book requires the publication
          of banns on three successive Sundays, after the second lesson at
          morning or evening prayer. This may be avoided by the procuring
          of a special licence from the Archbishop of Canterbury. In the
          United States banns are published only in the Roman Catholic
          Church and certain minor denominations.]

  I. Biblical Doctrine.

    1. Origin and Practise:

          Conybeare has tried to prove that the original text of Matt.
          xxviii, 9 did not contain the baptismal command or the
          Trinitarian formula, which were interpolated, according to him,
          at the beginning of the third century. But since the
          investigations of Riggenbach, the ordinary reading may be
          considered the original. Jesus, however, can not have given his
          disciples this Trinitarian order of baptism after his
          resurrection; for the New Testament knows only baptism in the
          name of Jesus (Acts ii, 38; viii, 16; xix, 5; Gal. iii, 27; Rom.
          vi, 3; I Cor. i, 13-15), which still occurs even in the second
          and third centuries, while the Trinitarian formula occurs only
          in Matt. xxviii, 19 and then only again Didache vii, 1 and
          Justin, Apol., i, 61. It is unthinkable that the Apostolic
          Church thus disobeyed the express command of the Lord, which it
          otherwise considered the highest authority. Occurrences like
          those of Acts xix, 1-7 ought to have shown that the prescribed
          formula of baptism could not have been shortened to "the name of
          the Lord Jesus," if the character of baptism was to be retained
          as commanded. Judging from I Cor. i, 14-17, Paul did not know
          Matt. xxviii, 19; otherwise he could not have written that
          Christ had sent him not to baptize, but to preach the gospel.
          Moreover, had it been known at the Apostolic Council, the
          missionary spheres could not have been so separated that Peter
          was recognized as the apostle of the circumcision, Paul and
          Barnabas as apostles of the heathen (Gal. ii, 7-8); rather would
          the original apostles have claimed the universal apostolate for
          themselves. Finally, the distinctly liturgical character of the
          formula Matt. xxviii, 19 is strange; it was not the way of Jesus
          to make such formulas. Nevertheless this baptismal command
          contains the elements which constitute Christian baptism; for
          the activity of the Son in baptism implies the immediate
          cooperation of the Father; and from the beginning Christian
          baptism has been considered the mediating agency of the Holy
          Spirit. Therefore while the formal authenticity of Matt. xxviii,
          19 must be disputed, it must still be assumed that the later
          congregations recognized as the will of their Lord that which
          they experienced as the effect of baptism and traced it back to
          a direct word of Jesus.

          If Matt. xxviii, 19 can not be considered as a baptismal
          command, we have no direct word of Jesus which institutes
          baptism; for Mark xvi, 16 belongs to the spurious appendix of
          the Gospel and is dependent upon Matt. xxviii, 19. But from the
          very beginning the Christian Church has universally practised
          baptism (Acts ii, 38; viii, 36, 38; x, 48; I Cor. xii, 13; Gal.
          iii, 27; Eph. iv, 5; John iii, 5), and must therefore have been
          convinced that it was acting according to the will of the Lord.
          The origin of baptism may perhaps be explained as follows: the
          word of Jesus in Acts i, 5 repeats John the Baptist's prophecy
          of spiritual baptism (Mark i, 8). Moreover, the farewell
          discourses in John and the expression epangelia tou pneumatos,
          which occurs like a technical term in Acts ii, 33; Gal. iii, 14;
          Eph. i, 13, postulate an utterance of Jesus concerning the gift
          of the Spirit to the disciples. But Jesus had spoken of baptism
          as a symbol of the gift of the Spirit. Being filled with the
          Spirit was for him the antitype of the baptism of John. When the
          disciples, after the completion of the Messianic work, took up
          again the baptismal rite which they had formerly practised at
          his command (John iii, 22; iv, 1, 2) as a preparation for
          admission into the Messianic congregation, and the Holy Spirit
          descended upon the baptized, they came to the conviction that
          they were acting according to the will of their Master and now
          combined the above-mentioned words concerning the Spirit and
          Christian baptism. Christian baptism has its real root in the
          baptism of John, not in the sphere of mysterious initiations and
          lustrations of Greek religious societies, or in the great wave
          of Babylonian baptism which poured over the civilized countries
          of that time from the East.

    2. Significance of Christian Baptism:

          The Greek phrase baptizein en or epi tOi onomati Iesou means
          that the act of baptism takes place with the utterance of the
          name of Jesus; baptizein eis to onoma Iesou means that the
          person baptized enters into the relation of belonging to Christ,
          of being his property. All three formulas are alike in so far as
          the baptized are subjected to the power and efficacy of Jesus,
          who is now their Lord. According to Paul (Rom. vi, 1-11; Col.
          ii, 11, 12; Gal. iii, 26, 27; I Cor. xii, 13; vi, 11; Eph. v,
          26;Tit. iii, 5), baptism secures purification from sins, the
          putting off of the sinful body of the flesh, mortification of
          sin, renewal of life, regeneration, the power of the Holy
          Spirit, communion with the life of Christ, incorporation into
          the mystical body of Christ, the Church. Everywhere baptism is
          represented as the mediating agency of real objective effects,
          with God as their cause, and not as a merely symbolical act.
          Paul's teaching on baptism is not a transition from pagan cults,
          but his mystical doctrine concerning Christ and the Spirit are
          to be explained from his religious experience, which he
          objectifies in a manner conditioned by the history of his time.
          The Book of Acts does not contain theological reflections on
          baptism like those of Paul's epistles, but simple views of the
          congregations, and the connection with the baptism of John is
          here plainer (Acts xxii, 16; ii, 38) than in Paul. It is true,
          we find also in Acts the relation of the gift of the Spirit to
          baptism (Acts ii, 38; viii, 13-17; xix, 6; in ix, 17-18; x,
          44-48 the gift of the Spirit precedes baptism), but this
          connection is looser than in Paul, and in some passages (viii,
          13-17; xix, 6) it is only external. Baptism is mentioned in the
          New Testament also in I Pet. iii, 21; Heb. x, 22; vi, 2; John
          iii, 5; xiii, 10. The act was often performed immediately after
          the recognition of the Messiahship of Jesus and the decision to
          join the Messianic congregation with out further preparation
          (Acts ii, 41; viii, 38; ix, 18; x, 33-48; xvi, 33). A detailed
          baptismal profession of faith was still wanting; but baptism in
          the name of Jesus was equivalent to such a profession.

  II. Church Doctrine.

    1. Patristic Teaching:

    § 1. Primitive Period

          The expressions of the Fathers on the subject are very
          indefinite, the symbolical and realistic features not clearly
          distinguished. It is perhaps not to be taken seriously when
          Justin (1 Apol., lxi) compares regeneration by the water of
          baptism with natural generation as its proper counterpart; but
          with Tertullian speculation concerning the general cosmic
          signification of the water, its inner natural relation to the
          spirit of God (Gen. i, 2), goes so far that he undoubtedly
          thinks of some sort of real connection of the Spirit with the
          water of baptism. He probably imagines that the Holy Spirit
          after the invocation of God makes his "abode" in the water (De
          baptismo, iii-v). But it is not clear how God or the Spirit is
          supposed to act upon man through the water or out of the water,
          how far through the agency of the body or how far through will
          and thought.

          Since the earliest days two ideas have been characteristic of
          the estimate of baptism the view that it forms the sure, and, as
          a rule, the only entrance to the congregation of Christ and its
          blessings, i.e., to salvation; and the belief that while its
          effects may be lost, it can not be repeated. To the former view
          there was only one exception, the belief that martyrdom, the
          baptism of blood, could replace baptism with water. Baptism of
          blood was even to be preferred in so far as it admitted directly
          and irrevocably into the heavenly congregation of Christ. Why it
          was considered impossible to repeat baptism with water is not
          quite intelligible. It is certain, however, that this view was
          soon felt to be a heavy burden. The more highly baptism was
          valued, the more was the loss of its grace dreaded, and thus a
          tendency grew up to postpone it to the end of life. None the
          less, as early as the second century the custom developed of
          baptizing children, if not infants in arms at least those of
          "tender age" (see below, IV, 2). Tertullian disapproved of this,
          being of the opinion that baptism should be postponed to the
          period of a fuller development. He is also the first to mention
          the institution of sponsors (see below, III, 7). All the
          blessings of the Church are brought into connection with
          baptism--forgiveness of sins, renewal of life (regeneration),
          reception of the Holy Spirit, proper knowledge of God
          ("illumination"), assurance of eternal life (incorruptibility of
          soul and body). In course of time, the different acts of baptism
          were separated--the immersion in water from the anointing and
          laying on of hands, which had been added, it is uncertain how
          early. It was then thought that immersion or ablution signified
          purification from sin, and the other acts equipment with the
          Spirit and bestowal of eternal life. In practise, however, these
          theoretical distinctions were never strictly kept apart.
          Tertullian required that as a rule only the bishop, or a
          presbyter or deacon delegated by him, should perform the act of
          baptism; only in case of necessity was a layman authorized to
          perform it (De baptismo, xvii). Cyprian goes so far as to say
          that a priest (sacerdos) "must" (oportet) "purify and hallow"
          the water (Epist., lxx, 1).

    § 2. Fourth Century.

          In the fourth century the doctrine of baptism was treated by
          Cyril of Jerusalem in his third catechetical lecture (MPG,
          xxxiii, 425 sqq.), by Gregory Nazianzen in his "Discourse on
          Holy Baptism" (Orat., xl, MPG, xxxvi, 360 sqq.), and by Gregory
          of Nyasa ("Greater Catechetical Oration," xl, MPG, xlv, 101; and
          "Address to those who Postpone Baptism," MPG, xlvi, 1). Both
          Gregory of Nyssa and Gregory Nazianzen desire an "early"
          baptism, at any rate no "procrastination." Baptism is here
          spoken of as a power of prime importance as an aid to man in his
          temptations. It is so necessary that even a child can not be
          saved without it. Gregory Nazianzen "recommends" that a child
          shall be baptized in the "third year of his life." That, in
          spite of the opposition to which Tertullian witnesses, baptism
          of children became soon more and more a general custom, is
          evident from the fact that Origen ("On Romans," bk. v) considers
          it an apostolic tradition. The motive for its enforcement
          differs with different authors. In fact, the general notions as
          to the meaning of baptism vary so widely that there was
          evidently not yet any recognized "church doctrine" in the strict
          sense of the word. Not a few ideas from the analogous rites of
          pagan mysteries crept into the teaching of theologians.

    § 3. Augustine.

          The first who developed a really dogmatic theory of baptism was
          Augustine, under the stress of his controversy with the
          Donatists (see [864]Heretic Baptism). His most important early
          writing on the subject is the comprehensive work De baptismo
          contra Donatistas libri vii (MPL, xliii), with which may be
          coupled the smaller treatise De unico baptismo contra Petilianum
          (ibid.). He makes a sharp distinction between sacramentum and
          res sacramenti. It is possible, according to him, to obtain the
          sacramentum without the res, the grace of which the sacrament is
          a sign. He also taught originally that one might obtain the res
          without the sacramentum, but later he abandoned this view, at
          least in regard to baptism. The older he grew, the more firmly
          he was convinced that baptism was indispensable for salvation,
          since men could be saved only within the Church, to which
          baptism was the only entrance. It is true, he was thinking in
          this connection primarily of adults; but even in their case he
          was of the opinion that God would be gracious if by any chance a
          catechumen should die without baptism by no fault of his own.
          Later, however, he believed that even children dying unbaptized
          could not be saved, although they would meet only the smallest
          degree of condemnation (cf. De peccatorum meritis et remissione
          et de baptismo parvulorum libri iii, MPL, xliv). In the
          controversy with Pelagius, Augustine had frequent occasion to
          develop and justify his views on the baptism of children (cf.
          especially his Epist. ad Dardanum, Epist., clxxxvii, MPL,
          xxxiii). It was Augustine especially who developed the theory
          that baptism had reference to original sin. It is true he laid
          more emphasis originally on sin in general than on original sin
          as the obstacle to be removed by baptism. But the more the idea
          of, the baptism of children began to occupy his mind, so much
          the more original sin became the central point of his interest,
          coupled with the question of the importance to be attached to
          faith in connection with baptism. He taught not that the
          children themselves had faith, but that the faith of the Church
          benefited them. Since the Church presents the children to God in
          baptism, making a confession of faith in their stead, God grants
          them real forgiveness and power for a real "conversion of the
          heart" when they grow older (cf. especially his Epist. ad
          Bonifacium, Epist., xcviii, MPL, xxxiii). But at this point his
          views on predestination come in, and with them his distinctions
          within the sacrament, according to which baptism does not
          suffice for salvation if one is not predestined.

    2. Roman Catholic and Eastern Teaching:

    § 1. Scholastic and Later Roman Catholicism.

          Scholasticism on the whole only elaborated and systematized the
          doctrine of Augustine (cf. Peter Lombard, Sent., IV, dist.
          iii-vii, and Thomas Aquinas, Summa, III, quæst. lxvi-lxxi). The
          views expressed in the Catechismus Romanus (part II, chap. ii)
          and in Bellarmine's treatise De baptismo (Disputationes de
          controversiis Christianæ fidei, II, ii, 1) rest upon the same
          basis. It became customary among the scholastics to explain the
          doctrine of the sacraments by the distinction of the conceptions
          materia and forma. Everything in the sacrament rests upon divine
          institution and therefore can not be altered even by the
          authority of the Church. The Church can not abolish a sacrament,
          and is bound to observe its matter and form, but may be assured
          of possessing and transmitting everything that the sacrament
          ought to contain and offer according to the divine will. If
          matter and form are properly connected, the sacrament produces
          its effects ex opere operato. The matter of baptism is water
          only; its form is the words, "I baptize thee in the name of the
          Father and of the Son and of the Holy Ghost." In baptism all
          sins are forgiven, in the child original sin, in adults actual
          sins also. With special reference to original sin Thomas teaches
          that it is taken away only reatu, i.e., in regard to its guilt
          (which is great enough to exclude one from the bliss of heaven),
          but not actu. The latter expression means that "concupiscence"
          still remains as a "tinder" (fomes) from which at any moment sin
          may be kindled into flame. Peter Lombard emphasizes the idea
          that natural concupiscence is "weakened." The Council of Trent
          (Sessio V) teaches that it is not sin in the proper sense. Real
          conversion follows baptism, but rests partly upon the grace
          which it bestows and which only needs to be used by our free
          will. Great significance is attached to the teaching of Thomas
          especially concerning the "character" which baptism confers.
          This also goes back to Augustine, who touches this idea briefly
          in order to establish the validity of the baptism of heretics.
          Baptism incorporates us with Christ under all circumstances. It
          confers the "character" of belonging objectively to Christ, to
          his "body," the Church. This character is indelible, and depends
          only upon the due administration of the sacrament as to matter
          and form. Thus baptism brings every one into actual contact with
          the flow of grace emanating from Christ. Whoever "interposes an
          obstacle" by not receiving baptism in the subjectively right
          disposition (for instance, as a heretic) does not experience
          this immediate contact with grace as justification until he
          subsequently removes the obstacle (as, in the case supposed, by
          returning to the faith of the Church). The character conferred
          in baptism carries with it the right and capacity to receive the
          other sacraments, and at the same time involves the duty of
          obedience to the Church. In practise it is the sacrament of
          penance which subsequently makes the character of the baptized
          heretic or hypocrite efficacious for salvation. On the basis of
          its theory of character, the Roman Church acknowledges "in
          principle" the baptism of Protestants, but practically is often
          in doubt whether the Protestant Churches perform baptism with
          due regard to matter and form. Converts are thus, where any
          uncertainty exists, baptized hypothetically with the form, "If
          thou art not already baptized, I baptize thee," etc. In one
          essential point scholasticism differed from Augustine, at least
          from the Augustine of the later, stricter period, by
          acknowledging not only the "baptism of blood," but the "baptism
          of the Holy Spirit" or "of desire" as conveying grace. According
          to Peter Lombard and especially Thomas Aquinas, an adult may
          even before baptism anticipate in faith the effects of baptism
          upon the heart (conversio in the proper sense); he may so
          efficaciously desire salvation as to be incorporated with Christ
          mentaliter and possess the res sacramenti without the
          sacramentum, so that if he should die suddenly, the votum
          sacramenti would be sufficient to secure him salvation. The
          Roman Church still denies salvation to unbaptized infants; the
          whole tradition on that point was so firmly established that
          scholasticism did not dare to think differently. According to
          this doctrine unbaptized infants do not go to hell, but they do
          not get into heaven; they remain in a special place, the limbus
          infantium (see [865]Limbus).

    § 2. The Eastern Church.

          Not much need be said of Eastern teaching in medieval and modern
          times. The later Greek mind seems to have found other
          "mysteries," not indeed more important, but more interesting and
          more in need of exposition. Of course, however, this sacrament
          could not be omitted from the considerations of [866]mystagogic
          theology. From the time of Cyril of Jerusalem and the
          pseudo-Dionysius the baptismal ceremonies have had their fixed
          place in these discussions; but a much larger place is given,
          especially in the Byzantine period, to the Eucharist. The most
          exhaustive treatment of the subject after the Areopagite is that
          of Nikolaos Kabasilas, metropolitan of Thessalonica (d. 1371),
          particularly in his treatise "On Life in Christ." The Greeks
          emphasize the ideas of regeneration and illumination, and
          conceive both under such aspects as are attainable by specific
          philosophical (Aristotelian) methods. The notion of a new birth
          is carried through by means of the terms "matter" and "form";
          and the doctrine of a transference from the kingdom of darkness
          or sin into that of light or truth is easily illustrated by the
          relation long supposed to exist between darkness and matter,
          between light and form or the true "idea" or image of God in
          man. The conception of original sin was current also among the
          later Greeks. The theologians of the seventeenth century
          considered Protestant views a corruption of the truth, which
          they found in an unconditional realism as to the value of the
          baptismal ceremony. Baptism to them is not merely the
          forgiveness, but the abolition, the extinction, of sin--although
          it is sometimes hard to seize the precise shade of meaning
          intended to be conveyed by their rhetorical expressions. They
          require, in opposition alike to Rome and to Protestantism, a
          threefold immersion, although the Russian Church has formally
          abandoned the practise of rebaptizing Westerns. They teach that
          children dying without baptism can not be saved, although
          Mesoloras, for example, lays stress upon the lightness of the
          penalty in their case.

    3. Teaching of the Reformers:

    § 1. Lutheran.

          In order to understand correctly Luther's attitude toward
          baptism, it is necessary to grasp his idea of grace, which forms
          the central distinction between the conception of the sacraments
          in Protestantism and Roman Catholicism. Luther defined grace no
          longer in the sense of divine power (virtus), but as a sign or
          token of the divine disposition--in the older Latin sense as the
          divine favor. He also considered baptism necessary for
          salvation, believing unconditionally in the command of Christ,
          Matt. xxviii, 19. He did not seek for the reason of this
          command, for its "necessity" in a rational sense, seeing in it
          simply an expression of the love of Christ, who desires to
          convince us through baptism of God's favor and thereby to awaken
          "faith" (fides in the sense of fiducia). In baptism we
          experience the actual bestowal of the favor of God, which,
          without it, does not, or at least does not indubitably, descend
          on man. Luther does not understand the necessity of baptism for
          salvation in the sense that the grace of God is included in the
          sacrament in an objective sense, but that while one can not be
          entirely certain of grace without the sacrament, in virtue of it
          one may be "always" assured of the grace of God in faith. The
          preaching of the gospel addresses itself too much to humanity in
          general; the sacrament applies itself to the individual as such,
          and thus gives him the assurance of grace, and in case of doubt
          it is the only full guaranty that he is in God's favor. Luther
          does not follow the Roman idea of "character" as conferred by
          baptism, but applies his new definition of grace to the content
          of baptism in order to establish the fact that baptism possesses
          validity for the whole life, validity as a real offer of grace.
          He seeks in baptism nothing but grace. Throughout the whole life
          that is realized which God in baptism makes known to us as his
          will through the signum, the act performed by means of water.
          Luther's idea of baptism was identical with his idea of the
          sacraments in general that they make plain and confirm the
          "Word." Like the Word, baptism can only be efficacious if it
          finds faith or establishes faith by its power. But in faith one
          can always look back on it, in order to know that he possesses
          God's grace.

          As in regard to Luther's view of the sacraments in general,
          three periods may be distinguished in his exposition of baptism,
          which, however, are characterized by their mode of expression
          rather than by a development of thought. From the first period
          originated the "Sermon on the Sacrament of Baptism" (1519;
          "Works," Erlangen ed., xxi, 229-244). Here he distinguishes
          especially between the "sign" and that which it "signifies," to
          establish the fact that it is faith which appropriates to man
          what the sign signifies. Immersion in water in the name of God
          denotes death to sin and resurrection to grace. The second
          period begins in 1520 and is characterized especially by the
          work De captivitate Babylonica ("Works," Erlangen ed., Opera
          varii argumenti, v, 55 sqq.). Here he puts all the emphasis upon
          the "promise" which the order of baptism contains. In reality,
          the Word is everything in the sacrament, immersion in the water
          is only the seal which confirms the Word and makes it fully
          certain. In the third period also, that of his controversy with
          the fanatics, Luther emphatically proclaimed that the Word is
          the principal thing in the sacrament. He maintained, at times
          almost in the spirit of the law, that baptism is based upon a
          "command" of Christ. On the other hand, he enthusiastically
          pointed to the fact that through the Word the water becomes a
          "divine, heavenly, sacred" element. This must be understood in
          the same way as his attribution of a divine character to parents
          and authorities. In the last analysis he only wishes to
          establish firmly and show plainly the unconditional authority of
          baptism as a representation of the divine will over us. His
          words are not to be understood in the sense of a theosophical
          speculation. To the last period belongs the Larger Catechism,
          the treatise Von der Wiedertaufe, an zwei Pfarrherrn (1528;
          "Works," Erlangen ed., xxvi, 254 sqq.), and a number of sermons
          on baptism, especially that of 1535 ("Works," 2d Erlangen ed.,
          xix).

          Melanchthon's doctrine is identical with Luther's. He says that
          God inscribes "by means of the water his promise" in a certain
          sense "upon our bodies." The Reformers were convinced that
          children must be baptized in order to be saved; for on account
          of original sin they also need pardoning and renovating grace.
          But if baptism must awaken faith in order to save the children,
          it was a great problem, at least for Luther, whether that could
          really be said to take place. He believed that it might, in
          consideration of the almightiness of the Word of God, which
          could even change the heart of the impious, and a fortiori could
          bring a child to faith. The different representatives of
          Lutheranism differed in the form of their teachings concerning
          baptism, especially the baptism of children, but in the matter
          itself they agreed (cf. H. Heppe, Dogmatik des deutschen
          Protestantismus im 16. Jahrhundert, iii, Gotha, 1857). In the
          orthodox period of Lutheranism baptism was always understood as
          a kind of representation of the Word (verbum visibile), in
          accordance with the statement of the Apology of the Augsburg
          Confession (vii) that the sacraments have no other content and
          therefore no other effect than the Word. But the doctrine was no
          longer sustained by the vivid intuition of Luther. When he spoke
          of the Word, he always had before his eyes the living
          personality of Christ as the incarnate Word of God; he "saw" in
          the Spirit how God graciously inclines to man. For the
          theologians of the orthodox period, on the other hand, the Word
          of God was simply the Bible, and the sacrament a constituent
          part of the Word because it represents a scriptural institution.
          They were sure that it was an especially powerful "word"; but
          they were no longer able to explain in what its power consisted
          and how it produced its effects. Quenstedt made regeneration and
          renovation, including that of children, dependent upon baptism.
          Regeneration was for him transposition into the state of
          adoption which is brought about by God's bestowing in baptism
          the power of faith (vires credendi). Since the baptized person,
          in virtue of this power, turns to God, he is also enabled to
          assume the vires operandi and to enter thereby on the process of
          moral "renovation," which continues throughout the whole life.

    § 2. Reformed

          Zwingli and Calvin also devoted much of their thought to the
          question of baptism. Zwingli, who became interested in it
          especially through the Anabaptists, wrote several special
          treatises on it. According to him, it is not the function of
          baptism to mediate grace, since that could be accomplished only
          internally and immediately through the Spirit of God; but
          baptism has its value as a means of setting children apart for
          God, and as a sign for them that they belong to the congregation
          of Christ and are bound to his service. Calvin was influenced
          more than any other Reformer by Augustine's distinction of
          sacramentum and res sacramenti, because, like Augustine, he
          always has predestination in mind, especially in connection with
          the baptism of children. In regard to the elect he believes,
          with Luther, in a real "bestowal" or "sealing" of grace through
          baptism. The sacrament signifies for them the beginning of the
          development of the "new life" in the Church. It is a peculiarity
          of Calvin that he rejects private baptism. The other Reformers
          hardly touched this subject; its position was established from
          ancient times. But Calvin thought that baptism, like all
          ecclesiastical functions, was a matter of the ministerium
          ecclesiasticum. A child, numbered among the elect, who dies
          without baptism, suffers no harm in God's sight. It is evident
          that Calvin counts baptism only among the normal means of grace
          which bind the elect to the Church, as they undergo their
          development on earth; but his reason can not be clearly seen.
          The orthodox dogmaticians of the Reformed Church continued the
          thoughts of Calvin (cf. A. Schweizer, Die Glaubenslehre der
          evangelisch-reformirten Kirche, ii, Zurich, 1847; H. Heppe,
          Dogmatik der evangelisch-reformirten Kirche, Elberfeld, 1861).

    § 3. Modern Developments.

          The age of pietism and rationalism showed no interest in
          baptism. Schleiermacher (Der christliche Glaube, §§ 136-138)
          treats baptism as the solemn act of reception into the
          "community of believers," in which alone the individual can
          attain real communion with Christ. Baptism of children,
          according to him, has no meaning unless Christian education
          follows, and it is only an "incomplete" baptism if it does not
          lead to a later act of confession of faith (confirmation). In
          the course of the nineteenth century the reawakened life of
          Lutheranism produced new, but on the whole not healthy
          tendencies in the doctrine of baptism. Scheel distinguishes
          three tendencies. The first is one which tries to give to the
          sacraments as a whole and to baptism especially a special import
          apart from the Word. Some small beginnings of this tendency may
          be noticed even in the old orthodoxy, especially in the
          teachings of Leonhard Hutter. In our modern time it is
          represented by Norwegian (Danish) and German Lutheran
          theologians, among the former especially by G. W. Lyng and
          Krogh-Tonning, among the latter chiefly by the Erlangen
          theologians Höfling, Thomasius, and others. Baptism is here
          explained as a natural power of the spirit which by means of the
          body renovates and "regenerates" the whole man. Theosophical
          speculations on the relation of body and soul form the
          background of this theory. Quite different is the second
          tendency, which is represented especially by H. Cremer of
          Greifswald and P. Althaus of Göttingen. In opposition to the
          former theory, the stress is here again laid upon the Word in
          the sacrament. Here also baptism is considered a bath of
          regeneration, but it is explained as neither natural nor
          "moral," but as purely religious or "soteriological." Baptism is
          a "transposition "into a new life, into the read life. It is
          assurance, of grace, and as such salvation from the judgment and
          death which we have deserved. Its moral effects follow as a
          natural result of justification. Faith is produced in the degree
          in which man becomes conscious of what God has done for him and
          assured him in baptism. In the child baptism denotes exactly the
          same thing as in the adult. It is necessary because the Lord has
          instituted it and made the effects of grace dependent upon it.
          The third tendency is chiefly represented by A. von Oettingen
          (Dorpat) and takes a middle ground between the two other
          tendencies. Here baptism is thought of as not only "convincing"
          like the preaching of the Word, but in an especial manner as
          both "generating" through assurance of grace and also, through a
          "realistic" transformation. of the nature of man,
          "regenerating." Emphasis is once more laid upon the thought of
          Luther that baptism, as distinguished from the general preaching
          of the gospel, assures the individual as such of his salvation.
          It is true, in baptism it is the "Word" which produces all
          effects, but it produces them in a hidden and often mysterious
          manner.

          Among recent works on baptism is that of Gottschick, who,
          impelled by certain events in Bremen, investigated the doctrine
          of the Reformers with a view to determining how far the
          Trinitarian formula is a constituent part of baptism. Scheel
          concludes his work also with a detailed dogmatic discussion.
          These writers, with M. Kähler (Die Sacramente als Gnadenmittel.
          Besteht ihre reformatorische Schätzung noch zu Recht? Leipsic,
          1903), are nearly related to each other in their interpretation
          of baptism. They go back to the living intuition of Luther, who
          saw the whole Christ standing behind the order of baptism, thus
          considering it not merely as of legal authority. Scheel shows
          especially that the proper act or rite of baptism can not be
          fully appreciated dogmatically, but only from the standpoint of
          the psychology of religion. Dogmatically he considers baptism
          only as the presentation of the Word or gospel. All three regard
          baptism of children as an arbitrary, but blameless custom, which
          is removed alike from dogmatic justification and from dogmatic
          criticism; the empirical efficacy of the "Word," they say, is
          incalculable.

  III. Liturgical Usage.

    1. General Development to the Reformation:

    § 1. Original Forms.

          The origin of Christian baptism seems closely connected with the
          Jewish custom of baptizing proselytes, which was based on the
          wide-spread idea of attaining ritual purity by ablutions, found
          in practically all the ancient religions. Whether Christian
          baptism be founded on a specific command of Christ or not (see
          above, I, 1), there is no doubt that it soon became a universal
          Christian custom. If there had been no other reason, it would
          have seemed obviously fitting, in the interest both of the
          community and of the new converts, that their entrance should be
          marked by a special rite. As soon as definite sacramental ideas
          were connected with the rite--and this must have been very
          early--it spread throughout the Christian organizations. It is
          an attractive theory, supported by Cyprian's express statement
          (Epist., lxiii, 17), that the Jews and the Gentiles in the
          apostles' time had a different manner of baptizing; that among
          the Jewish Christians a single immersion was the rule, in the
          name of Christ alone, on the analogy of the Jewish proselyte
          baptism, while the threefold immersion in the threefold name,
          which had its counterpart in the heathen lustrations, was the
          rule among the Gentile Christians. It is uncertain whether the
          later rite with which Jewish proselyte baptism was performed
          (see [867]Proselyte) was in existence at the foundation of the
          Christian Church; but if so, it is most likely that the
          Christian rite was a free adaptation of it. It is possible that
          the analogy of the reading of the commandments and the
          proselyte's promise to keep them suggested the similar vow on
          the part of the Christian catechumen (Clement, Hom., xiii, 10;
          Justin, I Apol., lxi; Tertullian, De spectaculis, iv), although,
          of course, it may have originated independently.

          The early course of the development made out of a simple
          symbolic action a complex ritual consisting of various
          ceremonies, quite in accord with the natural tendency of a
          sacramental conception. The first step was to add the laying on
          of hands. Baptism must not only signify entrance into the
          Christian fellowship and communion with Jesus, the forgiveness
          of sins and liberation from the power of evil, but also confer
          the gift of the Holy Spirit, imparted, indeed, by baptism
          itself, but more surely and definitely by the imposition of
          hands. The Didache and Justin do not mention this rite, but that
          does not prove that it did not exist. The importance attached to
          it is shown by the fact that in the two places in the Acts where
          it is mentioned (viii, 16; xix, 6) it is performed by apostles.
          According to the entire mental attitude of the period, it was
          undoubtedly looked upon as not merely symbolic but sacramental.

    § 2. The Subapostolic Age.

          For the subapostolic age the main authorities are Justin (I
          Apol., lxi, 2; 1xv, 1) and the Didache (vii), the former
          representing the practise of Rome, the latter that of western
          Syria. Yet they agree in all essentials. For both baptism is a
          complete immersion in the open air; if the Didache permits still
          water to be used in place of running, and affusion in place of
          immersion, the local conditions are obviously taken into
          account--the probably frequent scarcity of water in a Syrian
          summer. Both have the Trinitarian formula, which involves a
          threefold dipping or pouring. It is clear from the Didache and
          probable from Justin that laymen were authorized to administer
          the rite. Both agree in requiring the candidate to be fasting,
          in which other brethren specially interested are to join. It is
          a safe assumption from both that baptism was immediately
          followed by participation in the Lord's Supper. Thus by the
          middle of the second century the administration of baptism would
          seem to have been alike in essentials throughout the whole
          Church. The laying on of hands may not have been universal (Heb.
          vi, 2 shows that it was known in places outside of Rome and
          Syria); and here and there a formal profession of faith may have
          been in use. Nothing is yet heard of any consecration of the
          water, or of fixed seasons for baptism.

    § 3. In Tertullian.

          The first completely developed baptismal ritual appears in
          Tertullian. The forms already seen in Justin and the Didache are
          clearly to be recognized, but it is likely that not a few
          customs sprang up about the middle of the second century for
          which the earliest evidence is found in Tertullian. The most
          striking of these is the renunciation of the devil, which was a
          solemn ceremony full of meaning, and practically an essential
          feature in the territory of the Gentile Church. To judge from
          Tertullian's most detailed account in the De baptismo, there was
          a period of preparation, marked by frequent prayers, fasting,
          vigils, and confession of sin. The baptism proper begins with
          the invocation of the Holy Spirit upon the water (see
          [868]Epiklesis); next follows apparently the renunciation, and
          then the threefold immersion in the name of the Father and of
          the Son and of the Holy Ghost, with a profession of faith in the
          form of answers to the interrogations of the minister; then the
          anointing, and the laying on of hands with prayer. That the
          reception of the Eucharist still followed the baptism is clear
          from several passages; after this the newly baptized, clothed in
          white garments, join in prayer with the "brethren," and milk and
          honey are given them. For a week after baptism they abstain from
          the usual daily bath (De corona, iii).

    § 4. Lines of Development.

          Although this ritual gives the basis of the development of the
          next few centuries, it must not be forgotten that this
          development varied considerably in different parts of the
          Church. There is not space here to follow out the ways in which
          the East differed from the West, and one province from another.
          One main distinction between East and West is the greater
          richness of the rite in the former, while the latter held
          closely to primitive simplicity and even in course of time
          actually shortened the form--though later it was once more added
          to. This enrichment is to be explained along the lines of the
          preparation for the definite and final act of baptism by varied
          ceremonies of dedication and exorcism patterned after the
          ancient pagan mysteries (see [869]Exorcism); The catechumen was
          considered to have crossed the boundary which divided the
          kingdom of darkness from that of light with the first of these
          initiatory ceremonies. It is thus easily understood how the
          lines separating these preparatory ceremonies from baptism
          proper were fluctuating. On the one hand, things which had
          originally been part of the main rite were pushed back into the
          preparation, as in Jerusalem and Rome the renunciation and
          profession of faith took place in the outer court or vestibule,
          while the baptism proper began with the blessing of the water in
          the baptistery. On the other, the process which had once taken
          weeks was now compressed into an hour, and thus such things as
          the recitation of the creed, the giving of the name, the
          administration of salt, etc., became part of the baptismal
          ceremony. The close connection between baptism and the Eucharist
          made it possible for large sections of the latter service to be
          fused with the baptismal in places, as among the Nestorians,
          Copts, and Armenians. Thus, once more, certain actions
          originally part of the baptismal function gradually separated
          from it into independent rites, as the blessing of oil and
          water, and the unction after baptism, which developed into
          confirmation under hierarchical influence. The decisive elements
          in the development may be summed up in the following points: the
          increasing prevalence of infant baptism; the gradual decay of
          the catechumenate through this and through the large numbers
          coming to baptism; the tendency to imitation which brought in
          new customs, especially those followed by a dominant church with
          a definite ritual like Rome or Antioch; and finally the
          abbreviation of the ceremonies for the benefit of parents and
          sponsors.

    2. Development of the Ritual in Various Parts of the Church:

    § 1. Syria.

          For eastern Syria (the territory of the Syriac language, with
          its center at Edessa in Osrhoene), some information may be
          gained from the Acts of Thomas, which, although of heretical
          origin, probably do not differ from the orthodox rites on this
          point. These mention imposition of hands and prayer, anointing
          with consecrated oil, baptism in the name of Father, Son, and
          Holy Ghost (under certain conditions by immersion only), the
          service closing with the celebration of the Eucharist. This
          Syrian Church appears to have maintained its liturgical
          independence until Bishop Rabbula of Edessa (d. 435) introduced
          the customs of the Greek churches, especially of Antioch; but
          there may have been earlier influences from that source; the
          later Syrian Jacobites have essentially the same baptismal rite
          as is found in the Eastern Church at large, especially
          Constantinople.

          Coming to western Syria (with Antioch for its center) and
          Palestine (Greek-speaking districts), the primary authority for
          Coele-syria is the Syriac Didascalia (third century), from which
          the following order may be deduced: possibly first the
          renunciation and profession of faith; anointing with imposition
          of hands; baptism proper; imposition of hands by the bishop and
          further anointing. This agrees with what may be inferred for
          Antioch from the Apostolic Constitutions (middle or latter half
          of the 4th cent.), in which the seventh book, dealing with
          baptism and undoubtedly derived from an older source, is of
          especial value. According to this the order is as follows: in
          the anteroom, or outside the baptistery, the renunciation, the
          act of allegiance to Christ, the Trinitarian confession of
          faith, recited by the candidate, the consecration of the oil,
          and the unction; in the baptistery, a prayer of thanksgiving and
          blessing of the water, baptism in the threefold name, blessing
          of the balsam, imposition of hands and unction, Lord's Prayer,
          and prayer of the newly baptized. In its essential points this
          ritual is found also in Cyril of Jerusalem (d. 386); the main
          differences are that the first anointing takes place, according
          to him, within the baptistery, and that he does not mention the
          blessing of the water (though there is reason to think that he
          knew it), the prayer of thanksgiving, or the Lord's Prayer. Thus
          it is clear that the type of baptismal rite in western Syria and
          Jerusalem was substantially the same in the fourth century, and
          relatively simple, which speaks for its antiquity. The next
          glimpse afforded by tradition, about a century later, is in
          Dionysius the Areopagite (De hierarchia ecclesiastica, ii-iii,
          MPL, iii, 393 sqq.). This is much more richly developed; the
          individual acts are in some cases repeated three times, the
          blessing of the water has more formality, and imposition of
          hands occurs after the profession of faith, while nothing is
          said of the second anointing.

    § 2. Asia Minor and Constantinople.

          In the territory including Asia Minor and Constantinople,
          between 350 and 450 a baptismal ritual must have grown up and
          spread widely which did not differ essentially from the present
          Eastern usage. That of the Syrian Jacobites agrees with it, not
          only in general structure but even in the text of prayers--and
          since they separated from the Church in 451 (finally in 519),
          they must have had it before their separation. The oldest
          version of this liturgy, which the Jacobites traced back to
          James the Apostle, is probably that which bears the name of
          Basil the Great, and it is possible that it originated with this
          liturgically active bishop. Both types agree in placing the act
          of reception of catechumens and the last exorcism before
          baptism, and the reading of the Scriptures comes before the
          actual baptism. Here again, as in the Apostolic Constitutions
          and Cyril, the first act of the real baptismal ceremony is the
          blessing of the water. The Byzantine liturgy has only one
          anointing with oil before baptism, while the Jacobite forms have
          two before and one with chrism after. Little is certainly known
          of the Nestorian and Armenian liturgies, but both have much less
          connection with the Greek than has that of the Syrian Jacobites.

    § 3. Egypt and Ethiopia.

          The Egyptian liturgy has peculiarities which mark it off from
          the Syrian. It may be reconstructed from the prayer-book of
          Bishop Serapion of Thmuis (c. 350) and in the following form:
          blessing of the water; prayer for the catechumens, renunciation,
          prayer before anointing, anointing, confession of faith, prayer;
          presentation of catechumens by the deacon to the bishop, prayer,
          baptism, imposition of hands with prayer, consecration of
          chrism, anointing with it. The main differences between this and
          the rite of the Apostolic Constitutions, which originated about
          the same time, lie in the different positions assigned to the
          blessing of the water of the first unction and in the fact that
          the imposition of hands after baptism is distinguished from the
          anointing in the Egyptian, and closely connected with it in the
          Syrian. The later approximation of the two is attributable to
          the influence of the Syrian upon the Egyptian. The sixth century
          liturgy known under Baumstark's name places the blessing of the
          water (as well as of oil and chrism) within the main action
          instead of before it. Some later Egyptian liturgies place before
          the renunciation the anointing which formerly followed it. The
          Coptic liturgy ultimately had three unctions. That after the
          baptism separated into two--one by the priest immediately after
          baptism, the other by the bishop in the church (as in Rome). The
          later Egyptian liturgies (Baumstark's Alexandrian, the Coptic,
          and the Ethiopian) have a section at the beginning which is
          clearly the earlier reception of catechumens, containing the
          giving of a name, unction with the oil of catechumens,
          imposition of hands and exorcism, and wholly free from the
          Syrian influence.

    § 4. Rome.

          For the investigation of the Western development, Rome is of the
          greatest importance, as tending to influence the provinces,
          which at first had peculiarities of their own, though they
          agreed in general type. Unfortunately the information as to the
          early Roman development is very fragmentary. Justin's testimony
          has been already referred to; but there is no doubt that a more
          formal ritual existed than his words directly cover. That the
          Roman Church had an anointing after baptism is perhaps the only
          thing to be safely concluded from Hippolytus. Two centuries
          later, under Innocent I (402-419), this anointing had been
          divided between the priest and the bishop, whether the latter
          was present at the time or not, and the bishop claimed the right
          of consecrating the chrism and imposition of hands. From Leo I
          (440-461) the following order may be worked out: renunciation,
          profession of faith in God, blessing of the water, threefold
          immersion, anointing with chrism, and signing with the cross.
          From the sixth century the rite known as the scrutinies
          developed in preparation for baptism, taking place in seven
          special masses in the last weeks before Easter, to which the
          catechumenate period had now been reduced. At this time the
          Sacramentary of Gelasius and the first Roman Ordo show no
          essential changes from the order under Leo I. After the last
          scrutinies have taken place in the vestibule of the baptistery,
          including renunciation and profession of faith, clergy and
          people enter the baptistery singing a litany, and the blessing
          of the water follows; the "symbol" is recited at the time of the
          actual baptism in the form of three questions and answers; then
          the presbyter anoints the candidate with chrism on the back; the
          procession moves to the consignatorium, where confirmation or
          consignation is administered by the bishop, consisting of
          signing with the cross on the forehead and imposition of hands;
          and another litany leads to the eucharistic celebration. This
          form may have been used until the ninth century; but finally a
          tendency sets in to fuse the acts belonging to catechumens and
          competentes, in a shortened form, with the baptism, while the
          confirmation is more completely separated from it. By the fusion
          of the Ordo ad catechumenum faciendum with the actual baptismal
          ceremony is formed the present Roman rite, which in its final
          form dates from Paul V (1614). It has two different rites, one
          for infants and one for adults. The latter, representing more
          closely the ancient system, has the following parts: preparation
          by the clergy in the church, the candidates waiting without,
          including reading of Psalm xli, perhaps a survival of the
          ancient reading of Scripture; at the church door, the giving of
          the name, renunciation and profession of faith, threefold
          blowing in the face, signing with the cross on forehead and
          breast, prayer, more signs of the cross, imposition of hands,
          blessing and administration of salt, another imposition of
          hands, and exorcism--distinct traces of the old catechumenate
          ceremonies; in the church, confession of faith, imposition of
          hands and exorcism, symbolic opening of the ears, renunciation,
          and anointing--the ancient redditio symboli with its consequent
          exorcism; in the baptistery, baptism proper and confirmation.
          Rome endeavored constantly to spread its baptismal liturgy and
          customs through the other provinces. The scrutiny-masses were
          introduced into Gaul and the Frankish kingdom in the seventh and
          eighth centuries. In Spain the Synod of Braga (561) made the
          Roman rite binding on a whole province; it probably, though not
          certainly, spread into Africa, and Milan showed a tendency to
          accept it. The question as to what rites were used in these
          provinces before the Roman can not be answered completely, but
          some important points may be set down.

    § 5. Spain and Africa.

          It would seem that the ancient customs survived longer in Spain
          than anywhere else in the West. The witnesses, however, are
          late, beginning with Isidorus Hispaliensis (d. 636), whose De
          officiis ecclesiasticis makes it possible to establish the
          following order: blessing of the water; renunciation, pronounced
          by the candidate standing in the water; confession of faith in
          three parts, probably in the form of question and answer;
          baptism in the threefold name, but probably by a single
          immersion; anointing with chrism and imposition of hands,
          performed only by the bishop. The rite is somewhat further
          developed as it appears in Toledo with the De cognitione
          baptismi of Ildefonsus (d. 667). Here the blessing of the water
          is more ceremonious (a wooden cross is used); the single
          immersion is clearly shown; and after the entire ceremony the
          Lord's Prayer is recited and thus delivered to the new-made
          Christian, as it was among the Syrian Jacobites. Another ancient
          rite preserved in Spain was the foot-washing after baptism
          (attested by the Synod of Elvira, 306); and many of these old
          customs were retained in the missale mixtum of the Mozarabic
          liturgy. For Africa we get substantially the same account in the
          earliest witness, Tertullian, as in Cyprian, in Optatus of
          Mileve, and in Augustine, showing that little change had come
          about in two centuries.

    § 6. Milan and North Italy.

          For Milan and North Italy, the principal source is the De
          mysteriis, still generally, though not certainly, ascribed to
          Ambrose. Here the order was: the symbolic opening of the ears
          and unction on ears and nose, in the antechamber; in the
          baptistery, renunciation, blessing of the water, profession of
          faith by the candidate standing in the water, in the form of
          three questions and answers, one immersion following each
          answer, unction on the head, foot-washing, clothing in white
          garments, probably imposition of hands, and the Eucharist. With
          this in the main agree the four addresses of Maximus of Turin to
          the neophytes (fifth century; MPL, lvii, 771), and the
          pseudo-Ambrosian De sacramentis. The latter, however, has an
          additional unction before the renunciation, which is retained in
          the later Milanese usage, as mentioned by Archbishop Odilbert
          (d. 814). This ritual is characterized by the combination of the
          ceremonies belonging to catechumens and competentes into one
          service with the baptism proper, and in general is closely
          allied to that of the Frankish Church of the ninth century and
          to the later Roman ordo.

    § 7. Gaul.

          In Gaul, according to the sacramentaries which are here the
          first definite authorities, the service began with a solemn
          blessing of the water in the absence of the candidates; in the
          antechamber followed the renunciation; in the baptistery,
          threefold confession and immersion; in another place,
          confirmation by the bishop, clothing in white, foot-washing
          speaking generally, a simple and very ancient form of service.
          It contained only one unction, with chrism; but in the
          Sacramentarium Gallicanum a second is added, before the
          renunciation, with oil, on ears, nose, and breast, following an
          exorcism. This ancient ritual was either influenced or replaced
          by the Roman. The development reached by the time of Charlemagne
          is visible in the instructions sent by him to the bishops of his
          dominions in the last years of his reign, not later than 812,
          and obviously based on the Roman ordo. No absolute uniformity
          was, however, attained, so that even in the fifteenth and
          sixteenth centuries it is impossible to speak of one single
          baptismal ritual for Germany or for France; but they agree
          fairly closely in the prayers and in the formulæ for exorcism.

    3. The Baptismal Service in the Reformation Churches:

    § 1. Three Main Types.

          The transition stage was marked by simple translation of the
          current older ritual with out essential alterations, as in the
          service put forth by Thomas Münzer in 1524, though made in the
          previous year, and that of Luther in his Taufbüchlein
          verdeutscht, also 1523. Luther omitted the exorcism of salt and
          the opening of the ears, shortened the initial exorcisms,
          omitted the profession of faith by the sponsors, and used the
          Lord's Prayer as a prayer, instead of the earlier usage of
          reciting it in the hearing of the newly baptized for their
          instruction. This service, comparatively little different from
          the Latin forms, was widely used or imitated. The first thorough
          recasting of the service was made at Strasburg in 1525, and in
          the next year appeared a new edition of Luther's book; these,
          with Zwingli's order of 1525, form the three points of departure
          for the later development. Luther's is divided into two parts.
          Outside the church or in the vestibule occurred an exorcism,
          signing with the cross on forehead and breast, prayers, another
          exorcism, reading of Mark x, 13-16, imposition of hands, and
          recitation of the Lord's Prayer. At the font: salutation,
          renunciation and profession of faith, request for baptism, also
          made by the sponsors, baptism by threefold immersion, giving of
          the chrisom-cloth. The exorcism, deliberately retained by
          Luther, aroused opposition and controversy even in the sixteenth
          century. The Strasburg ritual, drawn up under Butzer's
          influence, left much less of the pre-Reformation service. It was
          composed of an exhortation ending with a prayer, the Lord's
          Prayer, Apostles' Creed, reading of Matt. xix, pledge of
          sponsors to bring up the child in the Christian faith, baptism
          by pouring, and final prayers. Slight alterations were made in
          1537 and later, but the service has remained in this essentially
          evangelical form. Zwingli's service consisted of an introductory
          formula, questions to sponsors, prayer, reading of Mark x,
          13-16, request for baptism, baptism, giving of chrisom-cloth. It
          is thus obvious that the Zwinglian and Strasburg services differ
          from Luther's in the omission of the exorcisms and renunciation,
          considered as in appropriate to the baptism of a child of
          Christian parents, and in the substitution of pouring for
          immersion.

    § 2. Later Development.

          These three forms have had decisive influence on the development
          of the Evangelical Churches. Luther's was the standard for the
          old Lutheran established Churches, with the omission here and
          there of the signing with the cross and the exorcisms. That of
          Strasburg had a powerful influence, through the cooperation of
          Butzer and Hedio with Melanchthon, on the "Cologne Reformation"
          of 1543 and a number of other German services, and more than the
          Zwinglian on that of Calvin, so that it gradually influenced the
          entire Reformed community with the exception of German
          Switzerland, where Zwingli was followed. The Church of England
          service has features of both Lutheran and Reformed types, the
          former predominating.

          The baptismal formularies of the German evangelical churches
          remained more or less on the old model until the age of
          rationalism, when the exorcisms (to which Spener had already
          objected) were removed together with the meaningless questions
          to the child, and in many places the renunciation; immersion was
          also generally discontinued. Even where the old service-books
          remained officially in force, the ministers frequently
          disregarded them and made use of private compositions, composed
          in thoroughly eighteenth century style, and unsuited to the
          taste of the nineteenth. The movement for the reform of the
          services which set in between 1810 and 1820 showed an
          inclination to return to the older formularies, not indeed
          restoring the exorcisms, but frequently including once more the
          questions to the child and the renunciation.

    4. The Minister of Baptism:

          It would seem that the original system allowed any baptized
          person to baptize others; at least it is impossible to assert
          that only the apostles or those commissioned by them could
          administer the sacrament (cf. I Cor. i, 14-17; Acts vi, 5; viii,
          12, 38). The same inference may be drawn from the Didache (vii)
          and Ignatius (Ad Smyrnæos, viii, 2). Tertullian allows lay
          baptism in the absence of a cleric (De baptismo, xvii), though
          the natural minister is the bishop--a view which became more and
          more prevalent, so that baptisteries were found only in
          episcopal sees. But the practical difficulty of enforcing this
          principle led bishops to commission others, especially
          presbyters. The natural right of the bishop was still expressed
          in the fact that it was he who consecrated the oils used, and
          gave the unction and laying on of hands after baptism. The
          scholastic theologians supplied a theory to fit this already
          ancient practise, asserting that the right belonged to the
          bishop, but that he might delegate it. The right of the priest
          was dogmatically declared, following Thomas Aquinas (Summa, III,
          lxvii, 2), by Eugenius IV: "the minister of this sacrament is
          the priest, who has ex officio the right to baptize" (Decretum
          pro instructione Armeniorum, 1439). The Catechismus Romanus (II,
          ii, 18) asserts that priests exercise this function jure suo, so
          that they may baptize even in the presence of the bishop.
          Deacons, however, were only allowed to baptize by commission of
          a bishop or priest.

          Yet, although thus the right to baptize was appropriated to
          officials of the Church, the old practise of lay baptism was
          maintained by the doctrine of the necessity of baptism to
          salvation. The validity of lay baptism is dogmatically asserted
          by Augustine (Contra Parmenianum, II, xiii, 29; Epist.,
          ccxxviii), but only, of course, in the absence of a presbyter
          and in danger of death. The Synod of Elvira (306) decreed (canon
          xxxviii) that on a journey by sea or in any case where no church
          is accessible, a layman, so long as he had not lost his
          baptismal grace by apostasy or bigamy, might baptize a
          catechumen in mortal illness, though the bishop was afterward to
          give the laying on of hands, if possible. These principles (with
          the exception of the restriction as to the moral quality of the
          baptizer) became generally accepted. Both the Catechismus
          Romanus and the Rituale Romanum permit both men and women, even
          unbelievers or heretics, to administer baptism in case of
          necessity, provided they use the proper formula. The Lutheran
          Church recognizes lay baptism as permissible in case of
          necessity. The Reformed Churches, on the other hand, denying the
          necessity of baptism to salvation, forbid it as a usurpation of
          the ecclesiastical ministry.

          The right of women to baptize has a separate history. There is
          no evidence that they baptized in the primitive age, though it
          is conceivable that the right was conceded to prominent women.
          Tertullian recognizes no such right (De baptismo, xvii),
          condemns the Gnostics who had the custom, and protests
          energetically when a woman appears in Carthage teaching and
          baptizing. In the acts of the martyrs, however, there are some
          cases of both teaching and baptizing by female martyrs, such as
          Domitilla and Chryse; and nothing but the existence of pushing
          women who claimed both this right and that of administering the
          Eucharist would explain protests like those in the Apostolic
          Constitutions (iii, 9) and Epiphanius (Hær., lxxix). That women,
          especially "clerical" women (widows and deaconesses) assisted at
          baptisms, especially in the unction of female candidates is
          evident from the Syriac Didascalia; but this did not involve the
          concession of the right to baptize. The modern Roman Catholic
          custom can scarcely, then, be a survival of ancient practise, as
          it is first sanctioned by Urban II (1088-99; cf. MPL, cli, 529).
          Thomas Aquinas justifies it on dogmatic grounds (Summa, III,
          lxvii, 4); but it is only permitted now in the absence of a man.
          The Lutheran Church retained the practise, Luther expressly
          declaring such baptism valid, and the Lutheran agenda giving the
          right especially to midwives.

    5. The Time for Baptism:

          No special season was observed in the apostolic age, nor is such
          limitation ever mentioned in the oldest Christian literature.
          But before the end of the second century Easter must have been
          recognized as the appropriate time. The fixing of a special
          season was the natural consequence of the great number of
          candidates and of the catechumenate system, which led up through
          common instruction to common reception of the sacrament. The
          choice of Easter was determined not only by the feeling that
          heavenly grace was more abundant at that time, but also by
          Paul's connection of baptism with the death and resurrection of
          Christ (Rom. vi, 3; Col. ii, 12; iii, 1). The increasing number
          of candidates led to the addition of Pentecost, for which again
          there was an intrinsic appropriateness. These two seasons were
          widely adopted, and the popes enforced them zealously against
          innovators (e.g., Siricius, 385, MPL, xiii, 1134; Celestine I,
          MPL, 1, 536; Leo I, 429, MPL, liv, 696, 1209; Gelasius I, MPL,
          lix, 52; Gregory II, MPL, lxxxix, 503, 533; Nicholas I, Ad
          consulta Bulgarorum, lxix). The oldest of these papal utterances
          passed into the collections of decretals and thus gained
          universal sanction. The first break in the practise came from
          the East, where it became customary to baptize at the Epiphany
          also; Leo I asserts that in Sicily more people were baptized
          then than at Easter. The second Irish synod under Patrick (canon
          xix, Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, ii, 678) puts the Epiphany on
          a level with Easter and Pentecost. Then it became customary to
          baptize also at Christmas, the evidence for which goes back to
          the sixth century, and on the feasts of martyrs, apostles, and
          John Baptist. Infant baptism made it all the more impossible to
          adhere to the few ancient days. Even Pope Siricius had admitted
          that children and the sick might be baptized at any time.
          Attempts were made to enforce the old restriction in the ninth
          century (synods at Paris, 829; Meaux or Paris, 845, 846; Mainz,
          847); but in the tenth it began to disappear. Thomas Aquinas,
          though he still prefers Easter and Pentecost for adult baptism,
          recommends that infants shall be baptized immediately after
          birth. The Rituale Romanum speaks of the vigils of Easter and
          Pentecost as the most fitting times for the solemn
          administration of the sacrament; but almost the only trace of
          the ancient custom is the blessing of the baptismal font on
          those two days as part of the regular ceremonies. From the
          eleventh century no more attention was paid in the East to the
          old seasons.

    6. The Place of Baptism:

          Primitive Christianity had complete freedom also in regard to
          the place. Running or sea water was, indeed, preferred; and the
          open air was the usual place (Victor I, d. 202, still
          presupposes this as the norm, MPG, v, 1485). But perhaps even
          while this was still the custom, the atrium was used for the
          ceremony which conferred entrance to the Church, until finally
          special baptisteries began to be built in connection with the
          episcopal churches (see [870]Baptistery). The restriction of
          baptism to the ecclesiæ baptismales was frequently attempted,
          but with diminishing success. By the present Roman Catholic and
          Greek usage, baptism in private houses is permitted only in case
          of necessity. The same rule was laid down by the Reformers, but
          in the seventeenth century the custom of baptizing healthy
          infants at home came up, and in the eighteenth became the normal
          practise in some Lutheran communities, especially among the
          upper classes, who considered it a distinction of rank; and the
          Reformed and Roman Catholic practise was partially influenced by
          this tendency. The Anglican Prayer-book requires children who
          have been privately baptized to be brought to their parish
          church as soon as possible thereafter for a solemn ceremony of
          formal "reception into the Church."

    7. Sponsors:

          The institution of godfathers and godmothers is not coeval with
          infant baptism, but originated in the custom of requiring an
          adult pagan unknown to the bishop to be accompanied, when he
          came to seek baptism, by a Christian who could vouch for him,
          and who was also bound to watch over his preparation and
          instruction. It is worth noting that in the Eleusinian mysteries
          the candidate to be initiated had a similar sponsor, known as
          mystagogos. The date of the Christian function is unknown. Since
          Tertullian is the first witness for sponsors at infant baptism
          (De baptismo, xviii), the custom must have been established
          before his time; and its existence may possibly be inferred from
          Justin (I Apol., lxi, 2). But the duties attached in modern
          times to the office of sponsor are rather those which would be
          connected with infant baptism. The sponsor was obliged to
          represent the child, since the oldest baptismal formularies,
          drawn up for adults, were used without change for infants, who
          could not answer questions, make the renunciation, or recite the
          profession of faith. This is clearly brought out in the oldest
          Egyptian baptismal ritual, where the parents are regarded as the
          most natural sponsors. Augustine takes the same view (Epist.,
          xcviii, 6); but he also contemplates the bringing of children of
          slaves by their masters and of orphans or foundlings by other
          benevolent persons. Attempts have been made to prove that the
          sponsorship of parents continued the usual custom down to the
          eighth century, and that an innovation is represented by the
          Synod of Mainz (813); but it is usually the case that such
          synodal decisions have a long previous history and raise to the
          rank of laws things already established as customs. Thus the
          seventh Roman Ordo speaks simply of godfathers and godmothers,
          and mentions the parents only in connection with the oblation,
          and then in addition to the sponsors. Cæsarius of Arles speaks
          clearly of the spiritual relationship into which the sponsors
          enter with the child in a way which, taken in connection with
          Augustinian ideas, would soon tend to exclude the parents from
          this office. Another consequence of the notion of spiritual
          affinity was the prohibition of marriage between sponsors, which
          appears as early as the Code of Justinian (V, iv, 26). The
          Trullan Council (canon liii) absolutely forbids marriage between
          a child's godfather and its mother. By the thirteenth century
          this view had extended so far as to prohibit marriages between
          the baptizer and the baptized or the latter's parents, between
          the sponsors themselves, between them or their children and the
          baptized person, or even between a godfather's widow and the
          godson or his natural parent. The Council of Trent diminished
          these restrictions, so that, according to the Catechismus
          Romanus (II, ii, 21), marriage is now forbidden only between
          baptizer or sponsor and the baptized person, and between the
          sponsors and parents.

          The close relation between sponsors and child was considered to
          lay a grave responsibility upon the former. Having renounced the
          devil and professed the faith on the child's behalf, they were
          bound to see that these vows were carried out. This is
          emphasized in the instructions of Cæsarius of Arles and in those
          issued for the Frankish mission, where Charlemagne insisted that
          the sponsors should know the creed and the Lord's Prayer
          thoroughly. This insistence tended to diminish, though Thomas
          Aquinas still presupposed the instruction of children by their
          godparents (Summa, III, lxxi, 4); but the Catechismus Romanus
          complains that "nothing more than the bare name of this function
          remains," and attempts to enforce its duties.

          Originally there was but one sponsor, but with the admission of
          parents to the office this principle was broken through. A
          tendency to increase the number as much as possible is attested
          by synodal decrees of the early Middle Ages, which place the
          proper number at two, three, or four. The Council of Trent
          allows only one sponsor of the same sex as the candidate, or at
          most two of different sexes. According to Roman Catholic law, a
          sponsor must have been baptized and preferably confirmed; the
          Rituale Romanum excludes infidels and heretics, those laboring
          under excommunication or interdict, notorious criminals, the
          insane, and those ignorant of the rudiments of the faith; monks
          and nuns, since their separation from the world makes it
          difficult for them to perform the duties, are not supposed to
          undertake them.

          The institution of sponsors was retained, with infant baptism,
          by the Evangelical Churches at the Reformation. Though parents
          were still excluded, the notion of spiritual affinity was
          dropped, and any baptized Christian is now, though it was not
          usual at first, permitted to take the office without regard to
          his creed--a latitude which would be illogical if the function
          carried with it the duty of religious instruction, as it does
          not at present. Some among those who recognize that it is
          practically an empty form are in favor of abolishing it
          altogether, while others would have it reformed and made once
          more a living reality. [The Anglican baptismal office (which
          contemplates two godfathers and one godmother for a boy, and
          vice versa) contains a solemn charge to them as to their duties,
          including spiritual instruction and bringing the child to
          confirmation at the proper time.]

  IV. Discussion of Controverted Points.

    1. The Argument against the Necessity of Immersion:

          In the view of those who do not practise immersion, baptism is a
          "washing with water in the name of the Father, and of the Son,
          and of the Holy Ghost," in which the "dipping of the person into
          the water is not necessary;" but it may be "rightly administered
          by pouring or sprinkling water upon the person" (Westminster
          Shorter Catechism, Q. xciv, and Confession, xxviii, 3). "We must
          bear in mind," said Walafrid Strabo a thousand years ago (De
          rebus eccl., xxvi, MPL, cxiv, 959), "that many have been
          baptized not only by immersion but by affusion, and may yet be
          so baptized if necessary." "Whether the person who is baptized,"
          says John Calvin ("Institutes," IV, xv, 19 end), "be wholly
          immersed, or whether thrice or once, or whether water be only
          poured or sprinkled upon him, is of no importance." "The mode of
          applying water as a purifying medium," says Charles Hodge
          (Systematic Theology, iii, 526), "is unessential."

          This is the position occupied also by Thomas Aquinas, Summa,
          III, lxvi, 7; Catechismus ex decreto Concilii Tridentini,
          Leipsic ed., 1853, p. 136 (Eng. transl. by J. Donovan, London,

          It is important to keep in mind the exact point which is in
          debate. This is not whether the Greek word which was adopted to
          designate this sacrament, and which has passed into English as
          "to baptize," means "to immerse." Nor is it whether the early
          Christians, or even the apostles, baptized by immersion. It is
          whether so slender a circumstance as the mode of applying the
          water can be so of the essence of baptism that nothing can be
          baptism except an immersion.

    § 1. Immersion, even if the Original Form, a Circumstantial Detail.

          The contention that immersion alone can be baptism is usually
          based on the presumption that baptism was originally
          administered by immersion. It does not appear, however, that,
          granting the fact, the inference from it is stringent. Its
          assumption throws baptism out of analogy with all other
          Christian usages, with the sister sacrament of the Lord's
          Supper, and with itself in other particulars. Probably no one
          imagines that the validity of the Lord's if the Supper depends
          upon painfully conforming in the mode of its celebration to all
          the circumstantial details of its first celebration. The Lord's
          Supper was instituted at an evening meal, as a part of a
          household feast which was itself the culminating act of an
          annual festival, from which it derived deep significance; in a
          private gathering, of men alone, who received the elements in a
          reclining posture. No one seeks to reproduce any of these things
          in the manner of its celebration. Even the use of unleavened
          bread, which might be thought a more intimate circumstance, is
          treated as a matter of indifference by a large part of
          Christendom. If primitive baptism were by immersion, it will
          scarcely be doubted that it was administered to completely nude
          recipients. The Jews, in their parallel rite of proselyte
          baptism, insisted upon this to such an extent that "a ring on
          the finger, a band confining the hair, or anything that in the
          least degree broke the continuity of contact with the water, was
          held to invalidate the act" (C. Taylor, The Teaching of the
          Twelve Apostles, Cambridge, 1886, pp. 51, 52). The allusions of
          the early Fathers imply a like nudity in their method of
          celebrating the Christian rite (Bingham, Origines, XI, xi, 1;
          DCA, i, 160). Few would demand that this usage should be
          imitated. In the midst of so much freedom in the circumstantials
          of Christian ordinances, it is not obvious that the mode of
          applying the water must be treated as of the essence of the
          sacrament.

    § 2. The Apostolic Practice not Certain.

          Nor is it easy to be sure what the mode of applying the water
          employed by the apostles was; or whether indeed it was uniform.
          No mode of applying the water is prescribed in the New
          Testament. In the record the New Testament gives of acts of
          baptism, the mode in which the water was applied is never
          described. It is never even implied with a clearness which would
          render differences of interpretation impossible. Nor does what
          we may think the most natural suggestion seem in all instances
          to be to the same effect. If we are inclined to fancy the phrase
          "to baptize in water" (Gk. baptizein en hydati, Matt. iii, 11;
          John i, 26, 31, 33) suggestive of immersion, we can not fail
          soon to recall that it may just as well mean "with water" and
          that it is varied, even in parallel passages, to the simple
          dative of cause, manner, means, or instrument (Mark i, 8; Luke
          iii, 16; Acts i, 5; xi, 16). If "baptizing in the river Jordan"
          (Matt. iii, 6; Mark i, 5), varied even to what some
          unidiomatically render "baptizing into Jordan" (Mark i, 9),
          strikes us as intimating immersion, we are bound to bear in mind
          that both phrases may just as well be translated "at Jordan"
          (Thayer's Lexicon, s.v. en, I, 1, c; cf. esp. Luke xiii, 4, and
          F. Blass, Grammar of New Testament Greek, Eng. transl., London,
          1898, p. 122); just as we are bound to bear in mind of those
          passages which, in our English Bible, speak of going "down into
          the water" to be baptized and coming "up out of the water" after
          baptism (Mark. i, 10; Acts viii, 38, 39), that they may just as
          well be rendered going "down to the water" and "coming up from
          the water"; and just as we are bound to bear in mind in the
          presence of all such passages that there are other manners of
          baptizing besides immersion, which require for their
          accomplishment going into and coming out of the water. If we
          read of a locality being selected for baptizing "because there
          was much water," or, possibly better, "because there were many
          waters," that is, numerous pools, or springs, or rivulets there
          (John iii, 23), we read also of the administration of baptism in
          circumstances in which there is no likelihood that "much water"
          was available--for example, in a private house (Acts x, 47,
          where the water almost seems to have been something to be
          brought and expended in the act; cf. Acts ix, 18; xxii, 16), or
          even in the noisome jail at Philippi (Acts xvi, 33). Candor
          would seem to compel the admission that not only is there no
          stress laid in the New Testament on the mode of applying the
          water in baptism, but that all the allusions to baptism in the
          New Testament can find ready explanation on the assumption of
          any of the modes of administration which have been widely
          practised in the Churches.

          In these circumstances it is not strange that appeal should be
          made to subsidiary lines of investigation, in the hope that by
          their means at least a probable judgment may be reached as to
          the mode in which baptism was administered in apostolic times.
          Of these, most frequent appeal has been made to these three: the
          philology of the term employed in the New Testament to designate
          baptism; the archeology of the rite as practised in the
          Churches; the inherent symbolism of the sacrament. It must be
          confessed that the results of this threefold appeal are less
          decisive than could have been wished.

    § 3. Philological Considerations.

          It is of course true that the term "to baptize" goes back to a
          root which bears the sense of "deep" (cf. W. W. Skeat,
          Etymological Dictionary of the English Language, Oxford, 1882,
          p. 733, no. 89). Its immediate primitive, the Greek verb
          baptein, from which it is formed by adding the termination
          -izein, which gives it a repetitive or intensive meaning (cf.
          Jelf's Greek Grammar, i, 331, § 330), naturally, therefore, has
          the sense "to dip," while "baptize" itself would primarily mean
          "to dip repeatedly" or "to dip effectively" Even the primitive
          verb, baptein, of course, acquired secondary senses founded on
          its fundamental implication of "dipping," but ultimately leaving
          it out of sight. Thus, as iron is tempered by dipping, when
          applied to iron baptein came to mean "to temper"; as garments
          are dyed by dipping, baptein came to mean, when applied to
          garments, "to dye"; and it soon passed on to mean simply,
          without any implication of the mode by which it is accomplished,
          "to temper," "to dye," "to steep," "to imbue," and the like.
          When, for example, the Greek bully threatened his fellow that he
          would "dye [baptein] him with the dye of Sardis"--a place famous
          for its red dye--he meant precisely what the English bully means
          when he threatens his fellow "to give him a bloody coxcomb," and
          was as far as possible from implying that the effect would be
          produced by a process of dipping. So when we read in the common
          Greek version of Dan. iv, 30 (35); v, 21, that Nebuchadnezzar
          was "wet [baptein] with the dew of heaven," there is no
          implication whatever of the mode of the application of the dew
          to his person. The derivative, baptizein, of course, lent itself
          even more kindly to the development of these secondary senses,
          because, as an intensive form, it naturally emphasized the
          effect. Accordingly it is rarely used more literally than of the
          sinking of ships by storm or by war, with the implication, of
          course, of their destruction; or of the bathing of persons
          (Eubulus, Nausicaa, 1), with the implication, of course, of
          their cleansing. It passes freely over into such metaphorical
          usages as when a drunkard is spoken of as baptized with wine, a
          profligate as baptized with debt, a city as baptized with sleep,
          a hapless youth as baptized with questions, or as when the
          prophet (Isa. xxi, 4, LXX) is made to say he is baptized with
          iniquity; the English equivalent in such cases being something
          like "overwhelmed," "steeped," or the like. Such a term
          obviously lay close at hand for application to the Jewish
          ceremonial lustrations, in which, not the mode, but the effect
          of the application of the water receives the stress. In the
          Greek Old Testament it has not yet, indeed, obtained the
          position of the technical designation of these illustrations.
          But the beginnings of such a usage are already traceable there
          (Ecclus. xxxi, 30 [xxxiv, 25]; Judith xii, 7; cf. II Kings v,
          14); and by the time the New Testament was written it seems to
          have supplanted the term commonly employed in the Greek Old
          Testament [louesthai for this purpose (cf. Cremer, s.v., and J.
          A. Robinson, in JTS, Jan., 1906, vii, 26, 187-189). At least
          that term occurs in the New Testament only once of a ceremonial
          lustration, and then only in connection with baptizein as
          explaining its effects, while baptizein occurs quite naturally
          in this sense (Mark vii, 4; Luke xi, 38; Heb. ix, 10) and is the
          term adopted, probably from such a preceding use, to designate
          the symbolical washing proclaimed by John the Baptist, and the
          Christian rite which is called "baptism." In these circumstances
          it seems very rash to assume that the word was applied to the
          Christian rite in its primitive meaning of "to dip"; or indeed
          that any implication of that primitive meaning still clings to
          it in this application. The presumption is very strong that even
          in its preliminary use of the Jewish lustrations, it had already
          "lost its earlier significance of dipping,' or immersing'" and
          "acquired the new religious significance of ceremonial cleansing
          by water'" (J. A. Robinson, ut sup.; cf. EB, i, 473; DB, i,
          238). In any event the stress of the word in its application to
          the Christian rite is not upon the mode in which the water is
          applied in it, but to its effect as a symbolical cleansing. The
          etymology of the word, in short, throws no clear light on the
          mode of applying the water in baptism in the usage of the
          apostles.

    § 4. Archeological Considerations.

          Nor does archeology lend much more aid. It is, indeed, true that
          the present divergences in the practise of the Churches are the
          result of growth, and that behind them lies what without much
          straining may be called a universal usage of at least
          theoretical immersion. And it is true that the earliest clear
          intimation which has come down to us of the manner in which
          Christians baptized, belonging probably to about the middle of
          the second century (found in the seventh chapter of the
          Didache), contemplates normal baptism as by immersion. But it is
          equally true that throughout the whole patristic period no one
          ever doubted the entire validity of baptism administered in
          other modes of applying the water. The Didache makes provision
          for baptism by affusion whenever water in sufficient quantity
          for immersion is not at hand (cf. A. Harnack, Lehre der zwölf
          Apostel, Leipsic, 1884, pp. 23-24; F. X. Funk, Doctrina duodecim
          apostolorum, Tübingen,1887, p. 3); and Cyprian (Epist., lxxv
          [lxix], 12-14; ANF, v, 401) argues the whole case out with
          respect to the baptism of the sick by affusion. No contrary
          voice is ever raised; but in various ways a full body of
          testimony is borne to the unhesitating acceptance, throughout
          the early Church, of baptism by affusion as equally valid with
          that by immersion. And despite the consentient testimony of the
          literature of the period to immersion as normal baptism, the
          entire testimony of the monuments is to the opposite effect (cf.
          C. F. Rogers, Baptism and Christian Archælogy, in the Oxford
          Studia Biblica et Ecclesiastica, IV, v; also Bibliotheca Sacra,
          Oct., 1896, pp. 601-644). This monumental evidence comes, it is
          true, from only a single section of the Church,--that which had
          its center at Rome; but it makes it clear that from the second
          century down to a comparatively late date baptism as actually
          administered, in that region at least, was not an immersion but
          an affusion, although ordinarily apparently affusion upon a nude
          recipient standing in shallow water. When we realize that this
          was the actual mode of baptism in the early Roman Church, we
          catch apparent allusions to it in the literature of other
          portions of the Church also, and begin to suspect it may have
          been prevalent elsewhere too. Indeed, we are deterred from
          confidently ascribing it to the Apostolic Church itself chiefly
          by the gulf of a century's width which separates the Apostolic
          Church from our earliest evidence, literary or monumental. This
          is not a century over which we may lightly leap. During its
          course the church usages for which we have both first and second
          century evidence changed greatly; and all the conditions for a
          development of new usages with respect to the mode of baptism
          were present in the circumstances of the times. Nor can we be
          helped over the gulf by the analogy of the Jewish proselyte
          baptism. For, in the first place, the points of departure of the
          two usages were different. The Jewish rite was rooted
          specifically in the bath preliminary to sacrifice; the Christian
          took hold through the command of our Lord and the baptism of
          John of the entire lustration system and tradition. And in the
          next place, the Jewish usage, just because a development of the
          presacrificial bath, owed its elaboration into a separate rite,
          to the cessation of the sacrifices, which threw the bath into an
          importance it could not have had in their presence; it is
          therefore too late in its origin to have served as a model for
          Christian baptism.

    § 5. Considerations from Symbolism.

          We are left, therefore, to the essential symbolism of the rite
          to indicate how it must needs be administered, and how,
          therefore, the apostles must have administered it. If, indeed,
          it could be established that the essential symbolism of the rite
          is burial and resurrection with Christ, an application of the
          water in such a manner as to suggest this might well be thought
          necessary to its proper administration. There are many who take
          this view, and seek support for themselves in the connection
          instituted between baptism and dying and rising again with our
          Lord in Rom. vi, 3-5; Col. ii, 12. The Church Fathers from a
          comparatively early date (certainly from the fourth
          century--Cyril of Jerusalem, Basil, Gregory of Nyasa,
          Chrysostom) were accustomed to speak familiarly of the Christian
          enacting in baptism the drama of redemption through death and
          burial and resurrection. But the Church Fathers never lost sight
          of the fact that the fundamental symbolism of the rite was
          cleansing; to them it was before all else the bath in which sins
          were washed away. And certainly the passages cited from the New
          Testament can scarcely be fairly adduced as implying that in its
          very mode of administration baptism signified for the Apostolic
          Church burial and resurrection with Christ. Their reference is
          not to the mode of baptism but to its effects. So little does
          Paul depend upon the very mode in which baptism is administered
          to suggest burial and resurrection with Christ, that he actually
          labors to make his readers connect their baptism with the death
          and resurrection of Christ by the aid of another mediating
          thought; viz., that their baptism was with respect to Christ's
          death for their sins. He repeats the heavy clause, "through
          baptism unto death" (Rom. vi, 4) in order to prevent them from
          missing a point which, if baptism in its very mode symbolized
          burial and resurrection with Christ, they could not in any event
          miss. This may not prove that baptism as known to Paul was not
          by immersion. But it seems to indicate that its symbolism to him
          was not burial and resurrection with Christ. And, indeed, it is
          hard on other grounds to maintain that this is the inherent
          symbolism of immersion as a religious rite. Few will maintain
          that this is the inherent symbolism of the Jewish lustrations.
          Few will maintain even that the baptism of John the Baptist,
          which most advocates of immersion as the only valid form of
          baptism will suppose to have been by immersion, was charged with
          this symbolism. It seems clear enough that baptism, the matter
          of which is nature's great detergent, has as its essential
          symbolism just cleansing. And this being so, there seems nothing
          in the essence of the sacrament to demand one mode of applying
          the water above another, within the limits of this symbolism.
          And we can not forget that our Lord Jesus himself said on a
          memorable occasion: "He that is bathed needeth not save to wash
          his feet, but is clean every whit"; and that the Lord Jehovah
          declared through his prophet that he would "sprinkle clean water
          upon his people and they should be clean" from all their
          filthiness. From which we may perhaps infer that out of the
          circle of ideas of neither the Old Testament nor the New
          Testament would it be imaginable that a complete bath were
          necessary in order to symbolize a complete cleansing.

    § 6. The mode of Applying the Water Unessential.

          It would hardly appear probable that the mode of applying the
          water in baptism can enter into the very essence of the
          sacrament, when it is so difficult to obtain certainty as to
          what that mode was in the hands of the apostles. Each of us may
          properly cherish an opinion of his own as to what that mode was.
          The opinion of the writer of this article is that it was
          probably by pouring water on the head of the recipient,
          standing, ordinarily perhaps, but apparently not invariably, in
          a greater or less depth of water. But he would not like to
          insist that no mode of administering baptism but this is valid.
          Certainly the New Testament lays no stress on the mode of
          applying the water; and even were it established that it was
          rather by immersion that the apostles were accustomed to
          administer it, it is not apparent that no other modes of
          administering it are valid. It might even be granted that the
          term "baptism" means nothing but "immersion," and that it was
          applied to this rite because it meant "immersion," and just in
          order to describe it as a rite of "immersion"; and still it
          would not follow that the rite can be validly administered only
          by "immersion." As in the case of the sister sacrament of the
          Lord's Supper, in which the term "supper," in its English form
          and in the Greek of the Lord's time, means an evening meal and
          was given to this ordinance because it meant an evening meal and
          to signalize the fact that the feast at which it was instituted
          was an evening meal, so in the case of baptism, it may be
          altogether conceivable that the name of the ordinance is derived
          from a prominent external circumstance connected with its first
          administration, and yet as far as possible from forming an
          integral element of the sacrament itself. Whatever may have been
          the primitive meaning of the term which was adopted to designate
          it, and however the rite was customarily administered in the
          first days of its use, the thing is a washing with water for the
          sake of cleansing to symbolize the cleansing of the sinner by
          the blood of Jesus Christ. And the main matter is therefore not
          the mode of washing, but the fact of washing.

    2. The Baptism of Infants:

    § 1. Arguments against Infant Baptism.

          A large section of Protestant Christendom, especially in the
          United States, dissents from the practise of infant baptism. It
          includes the various denominations of Baptists, Disciples of
          Christ, the Dunkers, Mennonites, Winebrennerians, and other
          Christian bodies. These Christians and their sympathizers in
          pedobaptist denominations, ground their dissent (1) upon the
          absence of a positive command of Christ, or of any account of
          apostolic procedure which expressly favors the practise; (2)
          they hold infant baptism to be a violation of the very idea of
          baptism, since baptism presupposes conversion and an intelligent
          profession of faith, which can not be expected from infants.

    § 2. Arguments in Reply.

          To these arguments it is replied in general that, while no
          positive command for baptizing infants is given by Christ or his
          apostles, the pages of the New Testament offer a strong
          probability that infants were baptized from the beginning; and
          the testimonies of Irenæus, Origen, and Tertullian confirm this
          impression. The argument in detail is as follows: (1) The
          general command to baptize all nations, naturally interpreted,
          includes the baptism of infants; and the mention of the baptism
          of whole households (Acts x, 48; xvi, 15, 33; I Cor. i, 16; xvi,
          15) implies the presence of children; at least their presence in
          some households is far more probable than their absence in all.
          If to these considerations be joined the reiterated assertion
          that the promise of the remission of sins and of the Holy Spirit
          was to the believers and their children (Acts ii, 38; cf. iii,
          25), we have a strong probability, to say the least, that
          infants were baptized by the apostles. (2) Christ's treatment of
          children, whom he blessed and pronounced to be members of the
          kingdom of heaven (Matt. xviii, 3; xix, 14) shows that children
          are fit subjects for the kingdom of heaven; are they not then
          also fit recipients of the initiatory rite, which is baptism
          with water? All baptism is in idea an infant baptism, and
          requires to begin life anew in a truly childlike spirit, without
          which no one can enter the kingdom of God. (3) The analogy of
          circumcision, which began with adult Abraham and then extended
          to all his male children, favors the baptism of infants. Baptism
          is the initiatory rite of introduction into the Christian
          Church, and the sign and seal of the new covenant, as
          circumcision was the sign and seal of the old covenant (Rom. iv,
          11). The blessing of the old covenant was to the seed as well as
          to the parents; and the blessing of the new covenant can not be
          less comprehensive. Infant baptism rests upon the organic
          relation of Christian parents and children (I Cor. vii, 14). It
          is a constant testimony to the living faith of the Church, which
          descends, not as an heirloom, but as a vital force, from parent
          to child.

    § 3. Origin of Infant Baptism.

          No time can be assigned for the beginning of the practise of
          infant baptism. If it had been an innovation, it seems likely
          that it would have provoked a violent protest. No traces of this
          can be found except in Tertullian, who, alone in the early
          Church, denies the expediency of infant baptism. The requirement
          of repentance and faith, which the apostles made a condition of
          baptism, was to be expected when it is remembered that their
          exhortations were addressed to adults. This will always be the
          mode of procedure when the gospel is first preached to a people.
          Adult baptism always comes first in every missionary Church.
          Infant baptism, it is reasonable to assume, arose naturally from
          the very beginning, as Christianity took hold of family life and
          training.

    § 4. Patristic Testimony.

          The three earliest witnesses to the prevalence of infant baptism
          are Irenæus, Origen, and Tertullian. The testimony of Irenæus,
          though not unequivocal, leans strongly in favor of the apostolic
          usage. Born probably between 120 and 130, a disciple of
          Polycarp, one of John's disciples, he was surely an excellent
          witness. He says, "Christ came to save through means of himself
          all who through him are born again [regenerated] to God,
          infants, and children, and boys, and youths, and old men" (Hær.,
          II, xxii, 4). The phrase "born again to God" refers plainly to
          baptism; in Irenæus's usage (cf. I, xxi, 1) baptism is "being
          born to God," and (III, xvii, 1) "the power of regeneration unto
          God." Origen, who was himself baptized in infancy, distinctly
          derives the custom from the apostles. "The Church," he says (on
          Rom. v, 9), "has received the tradition from the apostles to
          give baptism to little children." He also speaks of infant
          baptism as a "custom of the Church" (Hom., on Lev. viii, MPG,
          ii, 496). The opponents of the practise make much use of
          Tertullian (close of the second century). In his De baptismo
          (xviii) he counsels delay of baptism, particularly in the case
          of infants. But, when the passage is investigated, it is found
          that his motive is not the impropriety, but the inexpediency of
          infant baptism, on the ground that it involved the great risk of
          forfeiting forever the remission of sins in the case of relapse.
          The very argument proves not only the existence, but the
          prevailing practise of infant baptism. Tertullian does not even
          hint at its being a postapostolic innovation. His opposition is
          due to his peculiar theory of the magical effect of baptism in
          washing away the guilt of past sins, and is by no means
          antipedobaptist. Loofs (Dogmengeschichte, Halle, 1893, p. 137)
          sententiously sums up the early historic evidence in these
          words: "The rite of infant baptism can be traced in Irenæus, was
          contested by Tertullian, and was for Origen an apostolic usage."

          The practise of the third century is uncontested. Cyprian (d.
          258) says (Epist., lxiv) an infant should be in no case denied
          grace and baptism. The Synod of Carthage in 252 rejected the
          opinion that baptism should, like circumcision, be deferred to
          the eighth day after birth (cf. Hefele, Conciliengeschichte, i,
          115). But that the custom was not universally followed is
          evident from the cases of Augustine, Gregory Nazianzen, and
          Chrysostom, who had Christian mothers, but were not baptized
          till they were converted in early manhood; and Constantine the
          Great put off his baptism till his death-bed. Gregory Nazianzen
          recommended that the baptism of children be put off till they
          were three years old, unless there was danger of death. This
          delay was recommended by church teachers because of the
          prevailing doctrine of the effects of baptism, which was
          regarded as washing away original sin and all actual
          transgressions committed before the administration of the rite.

    § 5. The Schoolmen and the Reformation Period.

          The Schoolmen, following the later Fathers, taught that children
          are proper subjects of baptism because they are under the curse
          of Adam, and baptism washes away the guilt of original sin. As
          the mother nourishes her offspring in the womb before it can
          nourish itself, so in the bosom of mother Church infants are
          nourished and receive salvation through the act of the Church.
          It is not a question of faith but of the definite sponsorial and
          fostering act of the Church; so Thomas Aquinas (Summa, III,
          lxviii, 9, ed. Migne, iv, 646: "Children receive salvation not
          of themselves but by act of the Church") and Bonaventura
          (Breviloquium, vii, ed. Peltier, vii, 320A). A child can not be
          baptized before it is born, but if its head appear it may be
          baptized, for the head is the seat of the immortal agent (Peter
          Lombard, Sent., IV, vi, 2; Thomas Aquinas, Summa, III, lxviii,
          11). Thomas Aquinas (Summa, III, lxviii, 10) and most of the
          Schoolmen pronounced it unlawful to baptize the children of Jews
          and infidels without their parents' consent, but Duns Scotus
          took the opposite view (cf. R. Seeberg, Duns Scotus, Leipsic,
          1900, p. 364). The baptism of infants was expressly commended by
          the Council of Trent (Session vii, de baptismo, canon xiii). It
          was also commended by the Protestant Confession of the
          Reformation period. the Augsburg Confession (art. ix, with an
          anathema against the Anabaptists); the Second Helvetic
          Confession (xx, 3, also with an anathema against the
          Anabaptists); the Heidelberg Catechism (question lxxiv); the
          Gallican Confession (xxxv); the Belgic Confession (xxxiv); the
          Thirty-nine Articles (xxvii); the Scotch Confession (xxiii); and
          the Westminster Confession (xxviii).

          It must be admitted that adult baptism was the rule and infant
          baptism the exception in the apostolic age, and not until the
          fifth century, when the Church was widely established in the
          Roman Empire, was infant baptism general. It continued to be the
          universal rule, with some exceptions, as in the case of the
          Cathari, until the Protestant Reformation, when "believers'
          baptism" came to be insisted on by some leaders in Switzerland,
          Holland, etc. Infant baptism has no meaning apart from the
          Christian family and without the guaranty of Christian
          education. Hence the Church has always insisted on catechetical
          instruction, and most Churches practise confirmation as a
          subjective supplement to infant baptism. Compulsory infant
          baptism was unknown in the ante-Nicene age; it is a profanation
          of the sacrament, and one of the evils of the union of Church
          and State, against which Baptists have a right to protest.

    3. The Baptist Position Concerning Immersion and Infant Baptism:

    § 1. True Baptism a Burial in Water.

          The Greek word baptizein means "to dip," "to submerge." When we
          read in the Septuagint (II Kings v, 14) that Naaman went down
          into the Jordan and "baptized himself" (Gk. ebaptisato), we are
          compelled to understand a dipping; and there is cited from Greek
          literature not a single instance of the use of the word in which
          the idea of submersion is not involved. Wherefore it is held
          that the rite of baptism as spoken of in the New Testament was
          always a burial in water and that the command to baptize is a
          command to immerse. The burial in water has always been the
          practise of the Greek Church, its older patriarchates holding
          that there is no other baptism (Stanley, Eastern Church, Lecture
          i). The Baptists and some other bodies in Western Christendom
          hold rigidly to this view. Immersion is the only catholic act of
          baptism, the only one whose validity is recognized semper et
          ubique et ab omnibus. The burial in water continued to be the
          standard usage of the Roman Church for more than a thousand
          years. Thomas Aquinas speaks of it as "the more common" usage.
          It was the practise in Britain till the reign of Elizabeth, and
          is still demanded in the order of the Church of England for the
          baptism of infants unless the parents shall certify that the
          child is weak. Though pouring or sprinkling is now employed
          rather as a matter of convenience, effusion was for many
          centuries resorted to only in case of necessity.

    § 2. The Testimony of Cyprian.

          The first extended discussion of the question is found in the
          epistle of Cyprian to Magnus written about the middle of the
          third century. Being asked whether those can be deemed legitimi
          Christiani, "Christians in full standing," who, being converted
          in sickness are non loti sed perfusi, "not immersed in the water
          but having it simply poured over them," he gives an affirmative
          opinion but does so with the very greatest hesitation. His words
          are: "So far as my poor ability comprehends the matter;" and "I
          have answered your letter so far as my poor and small ability is
          capable of doing;" and "So far as in me lies I have shown what I
          think." He disclaims any intention of saying that other
          officials should recognize effusion as baptism and even goes so
          far as to suggest that those who have thus received affusion may
          on their recovery from sickness be immersed. But, citing various
          sprinklings in the Mosaic ritual, he gives the view, that
          necessitate cogente, immersion being out of the question, those
          who have been poured upon may be comforted by being told that
          they have been truly baptized (Cypriani epist., lxxv, [lxix],
          12-14; ANF, v, 400-401). This epistle makes it clear beyond all
          controversy that in the third century the ordinary baptism was
          immersion, and that even in the Latin Church there were those
          who declared it the only baptism. It further appears with equal
          clearness that affusion was never practised in the Apostolic
          Church, for had the apostles resorted thereto even in a single
          instance Cyprian would certainly have known the fact and would
          never have presented so mild an apology for a usage which had
          apostolic precedent, nor indeed would any one have taken
          exception to the practise.

    § 3. Origin of Affusion.

          For a thousand years the resort to the use of effusion was
          justified only on the ground of necessity. And the supposed
          necessity existed in the idea that baptism was essential to
          salvation and so that when immersion, the established rite, was
          out of the question, something must be put in its place or the
          soul would be lost. The use of affusion would never have been
          thought of except for the idea that water baptism was essential
          to salvation. But those who deny that salvation is conditioned
          on baptism, who regard baptism as merely a token of a salvation
          already wrought, see no necessity for a resort to effusion. They
          will continue to administer immersion whenever it is
          practicable, and where it is not they will let the convert die
          without any water baptism whatever. They condemn the use of
          affusion not only as unnecessary but as based on a gross
          superstition.

    § 4. The Argument from Symbolism.

          To the declaration that baptism is simply a washing, it is
          answered that Jesus's baptism of suffering was not a washing but
          a submersion beneath the tide of wo and that the baptism of the
          Holy Spirit is a whelming in the waves of divine influence,
          while many of the Fathers regarded the baptism of fire, not as a
          purification, but as a swallowing up of the wicked in waves of
          burning. And granting that originally the immersion was but a
          lustration, the apostles point out in it another image; viz.,
          that of burial and resurrection. The act of affusion contains
          nothing whatever of purely Christian symbolism, for simple
          lustration is found in the Mosaic and even in heathen ritual.
          The burial in water is the only distinctively Christian baptism,
          for it alone sets forth the death and resurrection of our Lord,
          which is the central fact of the Christian system. To the idea
          that the purpose of the "apostolic" immersion was simply a
          washing and that this can be attained just as well by a pouring
          or sprinkling, it may be added that the purpose of the pouring
          is simply a profession of faith, which can be given just as well
          by word of mouth, and thus that all use of water may be
          dispensed with. Those who abandon the "apostolic" immersion
          simply on the ground of convenience leave the way clear for the
          adoption of the position of the Society of Friends, the
          abandonment of water baptism entirely.

    § 5. Objections to Infant Baptism.

          As to the subjects of the rite, the Baptists hold that it should
          be administered only on profession of faith. There is found in
          Scripture no instance of the baptism of an unconscious infant
          nor will a fair exegesis discover in any text the remotest
          reference to such a usage. On the contrary, it stands in direct
          antagonism to the New Testament idea of the Church. The baptism
          of infants arose from the idea that in baptism one is
          regenerated and christened, that is, made a Christian. But, as
          they grow up, no difference appears between the baptized child
          of Roman Catholic or Episcopalian and the unbaptized offspring
          of the pious Quaker or the Baptist, or indeed of the unbeliever.

          The Presbyterians baptize infants on the ground that the Church
          is to consist (Westminster Confession, xxv, 2), not of the
          converted alone, but of believers "together with their
          children." The sons of believers, however, may grow up
          unbelievers, even atheists, and thus the Church, the bride of
          Christ, come to be made up in part, possibly the greater part,
          of the unregenerate, perhaps the immoral. When a child is
          "dedicated" to Christ, to baptize it without awaiting its
          hoped-for conversion is not only as unreasonable as it would be
          to ordain the infant to the ministry on faith that he will yet
          be another Jonathan Edwards, but it is also to introduce an
          impenitent element. into the Church. As well might the
          missionary baptize at the start the whole heathen tribe, who, he
          has faith to believe, will be converted.

          If an infant may be baptized on the ground that it is pure and
          sinless, then, since the babe of Turk or pagan is as pure as the
          child of the Christian, there is no reason why all infants, even
          the whole race of man, should not be baptized into the Church.
          The Church is based on the idea that there is a difference
          between the disciples of Christ and men at large. But there is
          no theory of infant baptism which does not freely introduce the
          impenitent into the Church, thus wiping out all distinction
          between the Church and the world. The burden of John's preaching
          was that the new kingdom was not simply a continuance of the
          Jewish commonwealth, that though all could be circumcised and
          introduced into the latter who could say, "We have Abraham to
          our Father," baptism and membership in the former were given not
          on parental faith but only on personal repentance. That baptism
          was given on different grounds from circumcision is seen in the
          fact that the believing Jews continued to have their infants
          circumcised (Acts xxi, 20), that Timothy who had been baptized
          was nevertheless circumcised, and that it was demanded that the
          Gentile converts be circumcised though they had all been
          baptized.

   Baptism For the Dead
          BAPTISM FOR THE DEAD: A custom mentioned by Paul in I Cor. xv,
          29. It probably consisted in the vicarious baptism of a living
          Christian for a catechumen who had died unbaptized, the latter
          being thereby accounted as baptized and so received into bliss.
          It is doubtful if the custom was ever widely prevalent and it
          seems soon to have died out in the Church, although kept alive
          by Marcionites, Montanists, and other heretics (cf. Chrysostom,
          Hom., xl, on I Cor.; Epiphanies, Hær., xxviii, 6). The sixth
          canon of the Synod of Hippo in 393 forbade the practise. It is
          observed by the Mormons at the present day.

          Objection is made to this interpretation on the ground that Paul
          would not have referred to such a practise with even a tacit
          approval, and that the practise is in sheer contradiction to
          Paul's doctrine of justification and baptism. Epiphanius,
          Calvin, Flacius, Estius, and others interpreted the Greek huper
          tOn nekrOn in the passage mentioned to mean "when about to die,"
          "on their death-bed."

          Another interpretation regards tOn nekrOn as referring to
          bodies, the baptism of which, on the supposition that they are
          mortal, would be useless. Another ingenious interpretation
          refers huper tOn nekrOn to the imminent danger of violent death
          at the hands of unbelieving persecutors incurred by those making
          a public profession of their faith in baptism. "What is the use
          of incurring such danger if there is to be no resurrection?"

BAPTISTERY

  Early Baptisteries.

          A building or a portion of a church used for administering
          baptism. The history and institution of baptisteries is
          naturally connected with the development of the baptismal form.
          Immersion, which was customary in the ancient Church, required a
          basin of the requisite depth, and the custom of solemn seasons
          for baptism made necessary a considerable space for the
          reception of the numerous neophytes. The atrium and impluvium of
          the antique dwelling, in which divine service was held for
          nearly two centuries (see [873]Architecture, Ecclesiastical, I,
          § 2), appeared first of all as fit for it and were used in the
          beginning for the performance of the rite (cf. Schultze, p. 51).
          The neophyte, after having received baptism, was led from the
          atrium to the congregation assembled in the adjoining space. But
          when the atrium became merely the vestibule of the basilica,
          being an open court besides, buildings were erected as early as
          the fourth century exclusively for the administration of baptism
          (Gk. baptisteria, phOtisteria, Lat. fontes, fortes baptisterii).
          As a rule these buildings were near the choir (as in St. Sophia
          in Constantinople, and the baptisterium of the Lateran
          basilica,), or toward the west (orthodox baptisterium at
          Ravenna), or on the west-front (Grado, Parenzo). Sometimes a
          location in the immediate neighborhood of the church was not
          considered necessary or could not be obtained from local reasons
          (Arian baptisterium at Ravenna). An open or covered gallery
          often connected the two buildings (Torcello, Aquileia, and
          elsewhere).

  Form and Structure.

          Baptisteries are almost exclusively buildings with central
          arrangement of circular or polygonal plan; the rectangular form
          is race. The walls were supplied with recesses, or a lower
          passage-way surrounded an elevated centred structure supported
          by columns and roofed with a dome. The development of the
          baptismal rite from the fourth century and practical
          considerations in general necessitated the addition of other
          rooms, as a vestibule (Gk. proaulios oikos, estOteros oikos,
          Lat. atrium; Lateran Nocera), a dressing-room, and more
          especially, a school-room (Gk. katechoumenon). In such rooms
          episcopal meetings were occasionally held. An apse or complete
          choir was also sometimes supplied. In the center of the
          baptistery was the basin (Gk. kolymbethra, Lat. piscina, fons),
          polygonal or circular, seldom cruciform, and artifically
          supplied with water (cf. J. von Schlosser, Schriftquellen zur
          Kunstgeschichte der Karolingerzeit, Vienna, 1892, no. 232). Low,
          ornamented barriers surrounded it, with openings for going down
          and coming up. Three steps--symbolically referring to the holy
          Trinity, in the name of which the baptism was performed--led
          down and up (gradus descensionis, and ascensionis). Curtains
          covered the basin and seats stood along the walls. The arts were
          employed chiefly in the mosaic decorations of the dome, but
          reliefs in stucco, marble ornamentation, and artistic pavements
          were also used. As subjects for pictorial representation the
          baptism of Christ and the hart panting after the water brooks
          (Ps. xlii, 1), representing the longing after baptism, commended
          themselves (cf. Schultze, pp. 205 sqq., 228 sqq., 240-241).
          Inscriptions were not lacking, telling of the purpose of the
          building and the blessing of the baptismal grave (Holtzinger,
          pp. 219-220; Schlosser, u.s., no. 910).

  Superseded by Baptismal Fonts.

          Most of the extant baptisteries of early Christian time (which
          were freely dedicated to John the Baptist) are in Italy (cf. O.
          Mothes, Die Baukunst des Mittelalters in Italien, i, Jena, 1882,
          125 sqq.). In the East some samples have recently been
          discovered and more may be looked for. In general the number was
          limited, since the right of baptism was connected with the
          episcopal churches (ecclesiæ baptismales), and was only
          gradually granted to the parochial churches. The discontinuance
          of the baptism of adults was not in itself a reason for the
          abolition of baptisteries; only the inner arrangement, as the
          form of the basin, was influenced thereby. However, for
          practical reasons, the tendency grew stronger to substitute for
          the detached building an addition, or rather a separate room in
          the church itself; during the Middle Ages the detached buildings
          became exceptional. In these baptismal chapels the font or basin
          took the place of the piscina. In the old plan of St. Gall
          belonging to the ninth century, the christening-font is already
          in the interior of the church (F. Keller, Bauriss des Klosters
          von St. Gallen, Zurich, 1884, plan and p. 18). Immersion, which
          was still customary during the Middle Ages, required a large
          basin (cf. the instructive illustrations from the ninth century
          in J. Strzygowski, Iconographie der Taufe Christi, Munich, 1885,
          plate viii, 4-7). The material was generally stone, but
          sometimes bronze or brass. The round or polygonal form may
          perhaps be looked upon as a survival of the antique piscina. As
          the latter was adorned by art, so also ornamentations and
          figurative representations are found on the outside of the
          baptismal fonts, such as the apostles executing the baptismal
          command of Christ and the baptism of Jesus. Sometimes the four
          rivers of Eden personified or lions served as supports; in Liége
          there were oxen, an imitation of the molten sea in the court of
          the priests of Solomon's temple. In the Gothic period the broad,
          massive form of the older time becomes more slender, and the
          architectural ornamentations occupy a larger space. Connected
          with the Roman Catholic rite of consecrating the baptismal water
          is the use of a covering, which in its artistic shaping is in
          harmony with the whole, and often develops into a high
          superstructure. In the Middle Ages enactments were passed by the
          Church concerning the material and other matters (Rituale
          romanum, de sacramento baptismatis, 30; cf. V. Thalhofer,
          Handbuch der katholischen Liturgik, i, Freiburg, 1883, 816
          sqq.). When immersion ceased to be practised in the Roman Church
          the baptismal fonts became smaller.

          The Protestant Church knows of no consecration of the baptismal
          water. In order to connect as closely as possible the two
          sacraments which were recognized, the baptismal font was at
          first placed near the altar,--a custom which in modern times has
          rightly been increasingly disregarded. As to baptism and
          baptisteries in the catacombs, nothing can be positively
          asserted, and all probability is against it. The water
          reservoirs which are sporadically found there, have no
          connection with baptism.

   Baptistines
          BAPTISTINES (BATTISTINI, BATTISTINE): A religious order for both
          sexes, named after its patron saint, John the Baptist. The male
          branch (Congregatio sacerdotum soecularium missionariorum de S.
          Johanne Baptista) was founded at Genoa by the pious priest
          Dominico Francesco Olivieri (d. 1766) and received papal
          approval from Benedict XIV in 1755. Its special purpose was to
          perform missionary work, which was carried on in Bulgaria,
          Rumelia, and China. The female order was instituted by Giovanna
          Maria Battista Solimani (d.1758), who established a community at
          Moneglia (33 m. e.s.e. of Genoa) as early as 1730. Olivieri
          became their spiritual director. In 1736 they removed to Genoa
          and in 1744 were confirmed by Benedict XIV under the official
          name of Hermitesses of St. John the Baptist. Each member took
          the name Battista, whence arose the popular designation of
          Battistine. They followed a rigidly ascetic life, marked in
          particular by strict fasting, and devoted themselves to works of
          charity. The male Baptistines ceased toward the end of the
          eighteenth century, but the female branch continued in Genoa,
          Rome (where a convent was founded in 1755), and elsewhere in
          Italy till the middle of the nineteenth century.

  § 1. Origin of the Name.

          The use of the term "Baptist" as a denominational designation is
          of comparatively recent origin, first appearing about the year
          1644. Its German equivalent (Täufer) was applied by Zwingli and
          others to the antipedobaptists of their time, expressing their
          opinion that the latter laid undue stress on believers' baptism;
          and the terms "Anabaptist" and "Katabaptist" (Wiedertäufer and
          Widertäufer) were used implying repetition and perversion or
          destruction of the infant baptism that for many centuries had
          been practised (see [874]Anabaptists). These designations were
          of course repudiated as opprobrious by antipedobaptists, who
          were content to call themselves "Christians," "Apostolic
          Christians," "Brethren," "Disciples of Christ," "Believing
          Baptized Children of God," etc. Early English antipedobaptists
          were stigmatized as "Anabaptists," with the worst continental
          implications, by their opponents, and were much concerned to
          disown this designation. In the earliest Particular
          (Calvinistic) Baptist confession of faith (1644) the churches
          concerned designate themselves as "those churches which are
          commonly (though falsely) called Anabaptists," and in the
          appendix to the confession (1646) they call themselves "Baptized
          Believers." In the confession of 1688 Baptist churches are
          designated "congregations of Christians baptized upon profession
          of their faith" and "baptized congregations." Other common
          designations (1654, etc.) are "Baptized Churches," "Baptized
          Christians," and "Churches of Christ in England, Scotland, and
          Wales." "Churches of Christ in London," "Churches of Christ in
          Ireland," etc., are expressions that occur in documents of
          1853-57. As a sort of compromise between "Anabaptists" and
          "baptised believers," "baptised people," etc., the term
          "Baptists" was gradually adopted (1670 or earlier). In 1672 it
          is used in a royal license.

  § 2. Precursors of the Baptists.

          Baptists have always professed to base their doctrine and
          practise exclusively upon New Testament precept and example. If
          they have failed to realize their aim, it has been due to
          imperfect understanding of the New Testament Scriptures or to
          the imperfection inherent in human nature. Baptists find their
          spiritual ancestry in all individuals and parties that during
          the early Christian centuries, the Middle Ages, and the
          Reformation time, in the spirit of obedience and loyalty to
          Christ, sought to stay the tide of incoming pagan and Judaizing
          error, or in times of general apostasy endeavored to restore
          Christianity to its primitive purity and simplicity. They find
          rejection of infant baptism and insistence on believers' baptism
          among the ancient, medieval, and modern Paulicians (Thondraki;
          see [875]Paulicians), with the common (if not exclusive)
          practise of immersion and the most strenuous effort to realise
          regenerate membership, which so far identifies them with
          Baptists; but with their adoptionist Christology and sectarian
          exclusiveness modern Baptists have little sympathy. In the
          Petrobrusians of the twelfth century (see [876]Peter of Bruys)
          Baptists find their principles almost completely embodied, but
          there is no indication that the former insisted upon immersion
          as the exclusively valid act of baptism. Many of the Waldenses
          and the [877]Bohemian Brethren rejected infant baptism and
          practised believers' baptism, but they seem not to have
          disfellowshiped their pedobaptist brethren and laid no stress
          upon immersion; while in the rejection of judicial oaths,
          magistracy as allowable for a Christian, capital punishment, and
          warfare, they put an interpretation on the Scriptures that
          modern Baptists do not approve. The historical relations of
          modern Baptists to the Anabaptists of the sixteenth century are
          close and direct. English Puritanism and Brownism (see
          [878]Browne, Robert), from which English Baptists sprang, were
          themselves products in part at least of the Anabaptist movement.
          A still more direct influence was exerted by the Mennonites of
          the Netherlands upon the English refugees that there became
          antipedobaptist (1609 onward). Anabaptists were the forerunners
          of modern Baptists in rejection of infant baptism and insistence
          on believers' baptism, in insisting on the sole authority of the
          Scriptures, in their efforts to secure and maintain regenerate
          church membership, in pleading for liberty of conscience and the
          separation of Church and State; but nearly all Anabaptists
          rejected oaths, magistracy, warfare, and capital punishment, all
          were anti-Augustinian in their anthropology, many were
          chiliastic, many were antitrinitarian, some were pantheistic and
          antinomian, many were communistic, and none (so far as is known)
          insisted on immersion as the exclusively valid act of baptism
          (see [879]Anabaptists).

I. The English Baptists.

  1. Rise of the General Baptists:

    § 1. John Smyth and His Congregation.

          [880]John Smyth became a Puritan as early as 1590 but continued
          in the Established Church until 1606, when he led in the
          organization of a separate congregation at Gainsborough, the
          members of which covenanted together "to walk in all his [God's]
          ways, made known or to be made known unto them, according to
          their best endeavors, whatsoever it might cost them, the Lord
          assisting them." In 1606 or 1607 they fled from persecution and
          settled in Amsterdam. They did not unite with the older Puritan
          church in Amsterdam, of which [881]Francis Johnson and
          [882]Henry Ainsworth were pastor and teacher, but were on terms
          of fellowship with this body. In his reply to Richard Bernard's
          Separatists' Schism, published some months after his arrival,
          Smyth expressed the profoundest aversion to "Anabaptists," whom
          he classed with Papists, Arians, and other heretics and
          anti-Christians," whose "prayers and religious exercises" could
          not be acceptable to God. By this time he had reached
          convictions in favor of pure congregationalism as against the
          presbyterial practise of Johnson. He soon took issue with "the
          Ancient Brethren of the Separation" as regards the use of the
          book [Bible] in reading, prophesying, and singing in church
          meetings, declaring it to be "no part of spiritual worship" and
          hence "unlawful"; he objected to the "triformed presbytery
          "(pastors, teachers, and rulers) as "none of God's ordinance but
          man's device"; and insisted that "in contributing to the church
          treasury, there ought to be both a separation from them that are
          without, and a sanctification of the whole action by prayer and
          thanksgiving." He is reported by some of his contemporaries to
          have objected to the use of translations of the Bible and to
          have insisted "that teachers should bring the originals, the
          Hebrew and Greek, and out of them translate by voice." He had
          evidently become hypersensitive regarding anything that savored
          of human additions to divine prescriptions.

    § 2. They Organize a New Church.

          Prejudice against the Anabaptists seems for some time to have
          hindered the application of Smyth's principle to infant baptism,
          but late in 1608 or early in 1609 it was borne in upon him that
          if the Church of England was apostate (as his Separatist
          brethren agreed), then its ordinances were invalid, and that
          infant baptism was wholly without Scripture warrant and so in
          any case to be rejected. Accordingly he and his followers
          dissolved their church, disowned their baptism (Smyth
          repudiating also his ordination), resolved to introduce anew
          believers' baptism and to effect a completely new church
          organization with the New Testament as their only guide. Smyth
          seems to have first administered the ordinance to himself and
          then to the rest of the company. Then as baptized believers they
          effected a new organization with Smyth as pastor. They now felt
          impelled to protest against the church of Johnson and Ainsworth
          as "a false church, falsely constituted in the baptizing of
          infants, and their own unbaptized estate." When charged with
          inconsistency and changeableness, Smyth insisted that a change
          for the better is always in order, and that not to change so
          long as complete conformity to Scripture has not been attained
          "is evil simply; and therefore that we should proceed from the
          profession of Puritanism to Brownism, and from Brownism to true
          Christian baptism, is not simply evil and reprovable in itself,
          except it be proved that we have fallen from true religion." In
          answer to the charge of "Se-baptism" he claims that there is as
          much warrant for believers baptizing themselves as there is for
          setting up a true church (which his Separatist opponents
          professed to have done), inasmuch as a "true church can not be
          erected without baptism," and that "any man raised up after the
          apostasy of Antichrist" may "in the recovering of the church by
          baptism, administer it upon himself in communion with others."
          He further justifies self-administered baptism on the ground,
          among others, that "in the Old Testament every man that was
          unclean washed himself; every priest going to sacrifice washed
          himself. . . . Every master of a family ministered the Passover
          to himself and all of his family." He adds: "A man can not
          baptize others into the church, himself being out of the church.
          Therefore it is lawful for a man to baptize himself together
          with others in communion, and this warrant is a plerophory for
          the practise of that which is done by us."

          As Puritans, Separatists, and Mennonites practised affusion at
          this time and as no issue was raised in the controversial
          literature called out by this new movement among English
          Separatists or in the later negotiations between these English
          antipedobaptists and the Mennonites respecting the act of
          baptism, it seems highly probable that Smyth practised effusion.
          Deep-seated prejudice against Anabaptists, unfamiliarity with
          the Dutch language, and the attitude of aloofness assumed by the
          Mennonites, furnish a sufficient explanation of the failure of
          these English antipedobaptists to secure baptism at the hands of
          the Dutch brethren with whom they had so much in common.

    § 3. Smyth Excommunicated by his Church.

          Shortly before or shortly after the introduction of believers'
          baptism, in sympathy with the Arminian movement then current and
          with the Socinianized Mennonism of the time, Smyth adopted
          Socinian (Pelagian) views, denying original or hereditary sin
          and the redemption of infants by Christ. He also adopted the
          Mennonite view that Christ did not derive "the first matter of
          his flesh" from Mary, that "an elder of one church is an elder
          of all the churches in the world," and that "magistrates may not
          be members of Christ's church and retain their magistracy."
          Smyth's church, led by Thomas Helwys and John Murton, then
          excommunicated him and his followers because of their departure
          from the principles on which the church had been constituted.
          These (thirty-three in number) now sought admission into the
          fellowship of the Mennonite church in Amsterdam of which Lubbert
          Gerrits was pastor. In their application they "confess this
          their error, and repent of the same, viz.: that they undertook
          to baptize themselves contrary to the order laid down by
          Christ," and express the desire "to get back into the true
          church of Christ as speedily as may be." Helwys and his
          associates besought the Mennonites to take "wise counsel, and
          that from God's word," how they should deal "in this cause
          betwixt us and those who are justly, for their sins, cast out
          from us. And the whole cause in question being succession, . . .
          consider, we beseech you, how it is Antichrist's chief hold, and
          that it is Jewish and ceremonial, an ordinance of the Old
          Testament, but not of the New." They cite the case of John the
          Baptist to prove that an unbaptized person may inaugurate
          baptism. They claim that "whosoever shall now be stirred up by
          the same Spirit to preach the same word, and men thereby being
          converted, may, according to John's example, wash them with
          water, and who can forbid? And we pray that we may speak freely
          herein, how dare any man or men challenge unto themselves a
          preeminence herein, as though the Spirit of God was only in
          their hearts, and the word of God now only to be fetched at
          their mouths, and the ordinance of God only to be had from their
          hands, except they were apostles? Hath the Lord thus restrained
          his Spirit, his word, and ordinances, as to make particular men
          lordly over them, or keepers of them? God forbid. This is
          contrary to the liberty of the gospel, which is free for all
          men, at all times and in all places. . . . And now for the other
          question, that elders must ordain elders; or if this be a
          perpetual rule, then from whom is your eldership come? And if
          one church might once ordain, then why not all churches always?"

    § 4. Attempts to Join the Mennonites.

          It might have been expected that the Mennonites of Amsterdam
          would receive with open arms these English brethren who were
          seemingly so thoroughly at one with them in doctrine and
          practise. Several considerations led them to hesitate. The
          connectional church order of the Mennonites made it necessary
          for the Amsterdam church to secure the approval of other
          churches in fellowship. An unwise act might easily rend the
          entire brotherhood, as unhappy experiences in the past had
          abundantly demonstrated. The Amsterdam Mennonite congregation
          found Smyth's party so thoroughly in accord with themselves that
          they were prompted to express to their brethren at Leeuwarden
          the opinion that "these English, without being baptized again,
          must be accepted." Yet, if the Leeuwarden brethren thought
          otherwise, Smyth and his associates were willing to accept and
          the Amsterdam brethren to administer a new baptism, if it could
          be proved from Scripture and reason to be necessary. The
          Leeuwarden brethren could not be induced to commit themselves as
          to the validity of Smyth's baptism or to assume any
          responsibility for what their Amsterdam brethren might do in the
          premises. One of the Mennonite brethren furnished Smyth's party
          with a meeting-place in the Great Cake House; but they were not
          received into full fellowship until 1615, three years after
          Smyth's death.

    § 5. Smyth's Declaration of Faith.

          In 1611 Smyth and his followers put forth a declaration of their
          faith in one hundred articles. The confession sets forth just
          views as to the nature of saving knowledge of God as involving
          conformity in character to God's attributes. Arminian views are
          clearly and moderately set forth with respect to God's relation
          to the fall and to human sin. "Adam being fallen did not lose
          any natural power or faculty, . . . and therefore . . . still
          retained freedom of will" (17). "Original sin" is declared to be
          "an idle term," there being "no such thing as men intend by the
          term, . . . because God threatened death only to Adam, not to
          his posterity, and because God created the soul" (18). It is
          accordingly maintained that "infants are conceived and born in
          innocency without sin" (20). It is asserted that "Adam being
          fallen, God did not hate him, but loved him still and sought his
          good" (22). "The new creature which is begotten of God needeth
          not the outward Scriptures, matures; or ordinances of the
          church, . . . yet he can do nothing against the Law or
          Scriptures, but rather all his doings shall serve to the
          confirming and establishing of the Law" (61-63). The outward
          church visible "is declared to consist" of penitent persons
          only, and of such as believing in Christ bring forth fruits
          worthy of amendment of life" (65). "All penitent and faithful
          Christians are brethren in the communion of the outward church,
          . . . though compassed with never so many ignorances and
          infirmities; and we salute them all with a holy kiss, being
          heartily grieved that we which follow after one faith, and one
          spirit, one Lord, and one God, one body, and one baptism, should
          be rent into so many seats and schisms: and that only for
          matters of less moment" (69). It is taught "that the outward
          baptism of water is to be administered only upon such penitent
          and faithful persons as are [aforesaid], and not upon innocent
          infants, or wicked persons (70); that in the outward supper
          which only baptized pennons must partake, there is presented and
          figured before the eyes of the penitent and faithful that
          spiritual supper which Christ maketh of his flesh and blood:
          which is crucified and shed for the remission of sins . . . and
          which is eaten and drunken . . . only by those which are flesh
          of his flesh and bone of his bone, is the communion of the same
          spirit" (72); that "there is no succession in the outward
          church, but that all the succession is from heaven, and that the
          new creature only hath the thing signified and substance,
          whereof the outward church and ordinances are shadows, and
          therefore he alone hath power and knoweth aright how to
          administer in the outward church, for the benefit of others: yet
          God is not the author of confusion but of order and therefore we
          are in the outward church to draw as near the first institution
          as may be in all things; . . . therefore it is not lawful for
          every brother to administer the word and sacraments" (81). The
          following declaration on liberty of conscience is especially
          noteworthy: "That the magistrate is not by virtue of his office
          to meddle with religion or matters of conscience, to force or
          compel men to this or that form of religion or doctrine, but to
          leave Christian religion free to every man's conscience. . . .
          That if the magistrate will follow Christ and be his disciple,
          he must deny himself, take up his cross, and follow Christ: he
          must love his enemies and not kill them, he must pray for them
          and not punish them, he must feed them and give them drink, not
          imprison them, banish them, dismember them, and spoil their
          goods . . ." (84-85). Going to law before civil magistrates,
          marriage with unbelievers, and the taking of oaths are forbidden
          to Christians. Community of goods in times of need is
          recommended.

    § 6. His Last Utterances.

          Smyth died in Aug., 1612, after a long period of decline during
          which he manifested a wonderful degree of charity toward all
          true believers. He expressed the profoundest regret for his
          bitterly censorious writings against the Church of England, the
          Separation, and Helwys, and showed the utmost aversion to
          everything controversial. In his Retractation of his Errors and
          the Confirmation of the Truth, published a year or two after his
          death, along with the confession of faith from which extracts
          have been given, and a brief account of his life and death, he
          restates the points at issue in the controversies in which he
          had been engaged, and in a thoroughly judicial and irenic spirit
          indicates what he is still constrained, without controversy, to
          maintain, as well as what he feels inclined to surrender. Helwys
          had been so intemperate as to charge him with sinning against
          the Holy Ghost in receding from the position he had reached
          regarding the independent inauguration of baptism and church
          organization. The point at issue was not the necessity of
          succession in the administration of baptism and the organization
          of churches, but whether "although there be churches already
          established, ministers ordained, and sacraments administered
          orderly, yet men are not bound to join these former churches
          established, but may, being as yet unbaptized, baptize
          themselves (as we did) and proceed to build churches of
          themselves; disorderly (as I take it)." Smyth points out that
          Helwys's contention would involve a recognition of the right of
          any two or three private persons (even women), in a community
          where rightly constituted churches abound, to disregard these
          churches and baptize and organize themselves. "Concerning
          succession, briefly thus much: I deny all succession except in
          the truth; and I hold we are not to violate the order of the
          primitive church, except necessity urge a dispensation; and
          therefore it is not lawful for every one that seeth the truth to
          baptize, for then there might be as many churches as couples in
          the world, and none have anything to do with other, which
          breaketh the bond of love and brotherhood in church; but, in
          these outward matters, I dare not any more contend with any man,
          but desire that we may follow the truth of repentance, faith,
          and regeneration, and lay aside dissension for mint, comin, and
          annis seed." Helwys understood Smyth to deny with the Mennonites
          that Christ received his flesh from Mary. He now points out that
          while once inclined to distinguish between the first and second
          flesh of the infant in the womb and to hold that the former was
          not derived while the latter, the product of nourishment, was
          derived from Mary, he has now reached the conviction that it is
          better to attribute his flesh to Mary without going beyond the
          Scriptures in curious inquiry "whereof Christ's natural flesh
          was made." He thinks it far more important that "we should
          search into Christ's spiritual flesh, to be made flesh of his
          flesh, and bone of his bone, in the communion and fellowship of
          the same spirit."

    § 7. Helwys Returns to London.

          By 1611 Helwys and his associates reached the conviction that
          flight in persecution and voluntary exile were absolutely
          unjustifiable. Late in 1611 or early in 1612 they returned to
          England and settled in London. Helwys was not content to carry
          out, with his company, his own convictions; he published (1612)
          A Short Declaration of the Mystery of Iniquity, in which "in
          great confidence and passion" (Robinson) he held up to reproach
          all the English dissenting refugees in the Netherlands, charging
          that in seeking to avoid being "sheep in the midst of wolves"
          the false-hearted leaders had fled into strange countries to
          save their lives and had drawn other people after them, leaving
          the true believers who could not thus save their lives without
          leadership and leaving their native land without gospel
          testimony.

    § 8. His Doctrines.

          In A Declaration of Faith of English People Remaining at
          Amsterdam in Holland (1611), set forth by Helwys and his
          associates, while Christ's righteousness is said to be imputed
          to all (general redemption), men are declared to be "by nature
          the children of wrath, born in iniquity, and in sin conceived
          . . . even so now being fallen, and having all disposition unto
          evil, and no disposition or will unto any good, yet God giving
          grace, man may receive grace, or may reject grace . . . ." It is
          further taught, "That God before the foundation of the world
          hath predestinated that all that believe in him shall be saved,
          and all that believe not shall be damned; all which he knew
          before. And this is the election and reprobation spoken of in
          the Scriptures, concerning salvation and condemnation; and not
          that God hath predestinated men to be wicked, and so to be
          damned, but that men being wicked shall be damned." It is taught
          "That man may fall away from the grace of God, and from the
          truth . . . . That a righteous man may forsake his
          righteousness, and perish." Civil magistracy is recognized as "a
          holy ordinance of God" and magistrates "may be members of the
          church of Christ, retaining their magistracy." From this
          confession, as well as from Helwys's Proof that God's Decree is
          not the Cause of any Man's Sin or Condemnation, published the
          same year, it appears that Helwys held to a moderate type of
          Arminianism, while Smyth had become almost Socinian in his
          doctrine.

    § 9. Baptist Publications.

          Little is known of the careers of Helwys, Murton, and their
          associates after their repatriation. In 1614 a zealous,
          clear-headed antipedobaptist, Leonard Busher by name, addressed
          to King James and the High Court of Parliament a treatise
          entitled Religious Peace: or A Plea for Liberty of Conscience,
          the first work on the subject published in English. Among the
          more striking sentences are the following: "It is not only
          unmerciful, but unnatural and abominable; yea, monstrous for one
          Christian to vex and destroy another for difference and
          questions of religion." "I do affirm, that through the unlawful
          weed-hook of persecution, which your predecessors have used, and
          by your majesty and parliament is still continued, there is such
          a quantity of wheat plucked up, and such a multitude of tares
          left behind, that the wheat which remains can not yet appear in
          any right visible congregation." "With . . . Scripture, and not
          with fire and sword, your majesty's bishops and ministers ought
          to be armed and weaponed." Having shown that even in the Old
          Testament time "the Lord would not have his offerings by
          constraint," he proceeds: "So now in the time of the gospel, he
          will not have the people constrained, but as many as receive the
          word gladly, they are to be added to the church by baptism. And
          therefore Christ commanded his disciples to teach all nations
          and baptize them; that is, to preach the word of salvation to
          every creature of all sorts of nations, that are worthy and
          willing to receive it. And such as willingly and gladly receive
          it, he hath commanded to be baptized in the water, that is,
          dipped for dead in the water." The last sentence would seem
          clearly to identify Busher with the Baptists as regards his
          conception of the subjects and mode of baptism; but whether he
          was a member of the little Helwys company or a disconnected
          antipedobaptist we are not informed. The following year (1615)
          there was published Objections answered by way of Dialogue,
          wherein is proved . . . that no man ought to be persecuted for
          his religion, so he testifie his allegiance by the Oath,
          appointed by Law, By Christ's unworthy Witnesses, His Majesty's
          faithful Subjects: Commonly (but most falsely) called
          Anabaptists. This somewhat elaborate and thoroughgoing plea for
          liberty of conscience proceeded from the Helwys company and has
          been attributed to John Murton, as has also A Most Humble
          Supplication of many of the King's Majesty's Most Loyal Subjects
          . . . who are persecuted (only for differing in religion),
          contrary to divine and human testimonies (1620). According to an
          early tradition recorded by Roger Williams, the latter treatise
          was written with milk brought daily in a bottle with a fresh
          sheet of paper each day rolled up for a stopper and the written
          sheet returned as stopper of the empty bottle to be deciphered
          by a friend.

    § 10. Further Traces of Baptists in England.

          Helwys seems to have died a few years after returning to
          England. Murton was thenceforth leader of the party. By 1624 or
          1626, as is learned from correspondence of members of Murton's
          connection with the Mennonites of Amsterdam preserved in the
          archives of the latter (B. Evans, Early English Baptists, ii,
          London, 1862, pp. 21-22), there were, besides the congregation
          at Newgate, London, small congregations at Lincoln, Tiverton,
          Salisbury, and Coventry, aggregating about 150 members.
          Differences had by this time arisen among the brethren and a
          minority, led by Elias Tookey, had been excommunicated. Both
          sides sought the moral support and the fellowship of the
          Amsterdam Mennonite church. As usual, the Mennonite brethren
          were extremely cautious, and required to be accurately informed
          on many points before committing themselves to either party.
          Tookey failed to satisfy the Mennonites on a number of points:
          he and his party thought it right to celebrate the Supper in the
          absence of an ordained minister; were not willing to refuse
          oaths or military service; while none of them denied the deity
          of Christ, there was difference of opinion as to what was
          involved in his deity. They wished the Mennonites to write to
          Murton and his friends on their behalf "in order to augment
          peace and welfare." In 1626 two commissioners from the five
          churches of Murton's connection visited the Mennonites of
          Amsterdam with a view to fellowship. These also were disposed to
          defend oaths as almost necessary at the time in England and to
          insist that Christ had his flesh from Mary. Against the practise
          of the Mennonites they were strongly inclined to perpetuate the
          weekly celebration of the Supper. They acknowledge that the
          ministering of the sacraments is inseparably united with the
          ministering of the word, but insist that without ordination
          servants of the church may "preach, convert, baptize, and
          perform other public actions with the consent of the church,
          when the bishops are not present." They crave the indulgence of
          their Dutch brethren in a difference of opinion regarding the
          right of a Christian to exercise magistracy. They insist upon
          the right of Christians to bear arms for national and local
          defense. The Mennonites treated both parties kindly but refused
          to enter into organic union with either. Two letters addressed
          to the Mennonites in 1630-31, the one by the church at Lincoln,
          the other by that at Tiverton, in answer to letters of reproof
          occasioned by their overreadiness to exercise severe discipline
          even to the wasting and scattering of their constituencies, turn
          the tables upon their somewhat patronizing counselors, justify
          their efforts to purge themselves of evil by abundant citation
          of Scripture, rebuke the Mennonites for their laxity, which if
          they had known before they applied for union (1626) they would
          first have sought to reform, and blame them for refusing union
          on grounds that can not be shown to be scriptural. One of the
          matters of complaint was that the English antipedobaptists
          disciplined members for attending the services of the
          Established Church. There is no indication of difference of
          opinion respecting the act of baptism.

          John Murton seems to have died about 1630, when his widow
          returned to Amsterdam and united with the Mennonite church.

          Somewhat vague traditions of the existence of Baptist churches
          about this time (in some cases considerably earlier) at Stony
          Stratford, Ashford, Biddenden, Eyethorne, Hill Cliffe, Booking,
          Canterbury, and Amersham are still current in England. Attempts
          to confirm these traditions by antiquarian research have so far
          failed. Some of the Baptist churches that claim early foundation
          may have grown out of Anabaptist, Lollard, or Separatist
          congregations of the earlier time. Little further is known of
          English antipedobaptist life until about 1640-42, when in common
          with the Calvinistic antipedobaptists, they became convinced
          that immersion alone is baptism.

  2. Rise of the Particular (Calvinistic) Baptists:

    § 1. Congregations in London.

          In 1616 Henry Jacob, a learned Puritan minister, who for some
          years had been pastor of an English congregation at Middelburg,
          Zealand, and who had published a number of works against the
          English establishment, after much conference with his Separatist
          brethren in the Netherlands and in England and much fasting and
          prayer with his associates, reached the conviction that duty
          required him to return to England and to "venture himself for
          the kingdom of Christ's sake." Such of his members as chose to
          return with him he organized anew at Southwark, London, all
          covenanting together "to walk in all God's ways as he had
          revealed or should make known to them." The congregation
          proceeded to choose and ordain Jacob pastor and "many saints
          were joined to them." After about eight years of heroic service
          and suffering, Jacob emigrated to America. After an interval,
          John Lathrop became pastor and with many of the members spent
          much of the time in prison. Finding it impossible to labor in
          England Lathrop also sailed for America (1634). In 1633,
          differences of opinion having arisen as to recognition of the
          parish churches, a number of the brethren were peaceably
          dismissed to form an independent congregation, "Mr. Eaton with
          some others receiving a further baptism." John Spilsbury's name
          does not appear among the seceders of 1633, but some time in
          between this date and the second secession of 1638 he had become
          the pastor of an antipedobaptist congregation; whether this was
          distinct from Eaton's congregation does not clearly appear. The
          record reads "These also being of the same judgment with Sam
          Eaton and desiring to depart and not be censured, our interest
          in them was remitted with prayer made in their behalf, June 8,
          1638, they having just forsaken us and joined with Mr.
          Spilsbury." Shortly before or shortly after this secession
          William Kiffin, then a young man of twenty-two, afterward till
          1701 one of the most influential leaders of the Particular
          Baptists, united with Eaton. The learned and zealous Henry
          Jessey had become pastor of the Jacob-Lathrop church in 1637. In
          1640 the conviction that "dipping the body into the water" is
          the only valid baptism forced itself upon a number of the
          members and the matter was much agitated in antipedobantist
          circles. As a result of conferences on this matter Richard
          Blount, who understood Dutch, was sent to Holland where the
          Collegiants of Rhynsburg (see [883]Collegiants) were practising
          immersion, and received baptism at the hands of J. Batte, a
          teacher among them. This party had arisen about 1619, but its
          immersion may have been derived from the Polish (Socinian)
          antipedobaptists. On his return Blount immersed Blacklock, and
          they two baptized large numbers (1641). The immersionist
          antipedobaptists had by this time formed themselves into two
          companies. Spilsbury insisted that "baptizedness is not
          essential to the administrator" of baptism and, with a number of
          adherents, discountenanced Blount's method of restoring baptism.
          As the agitation had been going on for some months before
          Blount's journey to Holland, it is not unlikely that Spilsbury
          and his adherents, including Kiffin, had some time before
          introduced immersion independently. Spilsbury's argument against
          the necessity of succession in baptism prevailed. In 1643
          friendly discussion of the question of infant baptism was
          renewed in the congregation of which Jessey was pastor. Hanserd
          Knollys, a university graduate and Puritan preacher who had
          spent some time in New England and had found himself out of
          harmony with the theocracy, was at this time a member of
          Jessey's church. According to the ancient records "H. K., our
          brother, not being satisfied for baptizing his child, after it
          had been endeavored by the elder and by one or two more, himself
          referred to the church then that they might satisfy him or he
          rectify them, if amiss therein, which was well accepted. Hence
          meetings were appointed for conference about it . . . and each
          was performed with prayer and much love." An interesting outline
          of the arguments pro and con by Jessey and Knollys, in which
          other brethren (Kiffin among them) joined is given in the
          record. A considerable number were convinced with Knollys
          against the baptism of infants, and the church after taking the
          advice of the elders and brethren of other churches (including
          Praisegod Barebone, Dr. Parker, Thomas Goodwin, Philip Nye,
          Simpson, and Burrows), several of whom had recently returned
          from exile in the Netherlands and were to become prominent
          members of the Westminster Assembly, it was decided that
          inasmuch as the antipedobaptist brethren had absented
          themselves, not from obstinacy, but from tender conscience and
          holiness, and in order to avoid disturbing the proceedings of
          the church, that the church would not "excommunicate, no, nor
          admonish, which is only to obstinate, to count them still of our
          church and pray (for) and love them," and to "desire conversing
          together so far as their principles permit them." By this time
          Kiffin had become pastor of a church and some of those who left
          Jessey's church on this occasion joined with him, while others
          organized themselves into a new church with Knollys as pastor
          (1644).

    § 2. Confession of 1644.

          By October 1644, the Calvinistic antipedobaptists of London who
          had adopted immersion as the exclusively valid form of baptism
          "had become seven churches." At this time, in order to defend
          themselves against charges of Arminianism, opposition to civil
          government, etc., usually associated with the name "Anabaptist"
          and slanderously urged against themselves, representatives of
          these churches united in a confession of faith in fifty-two
          articles, wherein along with Calvinistic teachings on theology,
          Christology, and anthropology, are set forth Baptist views of
          baptism and the Supper (the "dipping or plunging of the body" of
          the believer "under water," the Supper to be partaken of after
          baptism), magistracy, oaths, etc., and a vigorous statement of
          the doctrine of liberty of conscience." But if any man shall
          impose upon us anything that we see not to be commanded by our
          Lord Jesus Christ, we should in his strength rather embrace all
          reproaches and tortures of men, to be stripped of all outward
          comforts, and, if it were possible, to die a thousand deaths,
          rather than do anything against the least tittle of the truth of
          God, or against the light of our own consciences." This
          confession was signed by fifteen brethren representing the seven
          churches. The name of Kiffin stands first, those of Spilsbury,
          Skippard, Gunne, Webb, Hobson, and Phelps, are first in the
          other groups. In the second edition (1646) a French church
          represented by Le Barbier and Le Durst is added, and the names
          of Hanserd Knollys, Benjamin Cox, and Thomas Holms appear for
          the first time.

          The following record, written apparently by Jessey, dates from
          1644: "After that H. Jessey was convinced also, the next morning
          early after that which had been a day of solemn seeking the Lord
          in fasting and prayer (That if infant baptism were unlawful and
          if we should be further baptized, etc., the Lord would not hide
          it from us, but cause us to know it). First H. Jessey was
          convinced against pedobaptism and then that himself should be
          baptized (notwithstanding many conferences with his honored and
          beloved brethren Mr. Nye, Mr. Th. Goodwin, Mr. Burroughs, Mr.
          Greenhill, Mr. Cradock, Mr. Carter, etc., etc. . . .), and was
          baptized by Mr. Knollys, and then by degrees he baptized many of
          the church, when convinced they desired it." Several who had
          left the church to become Baptists now returned. Jessey long
          continued to minister to a mixed congregation, Baptists and
          pedobaptists mutually tolerating each other. In the general
          religious ferment which set in with the opening of the Long
          Parliament (Nov. 3, 1640) and the greater freedom which was then
          allowed, many who had doubted the propriety of infant baptism
          felt free to avow and propagate their principles.

  3. General Baptists from 1841 Onward:

    § 1 Organization and Polity.

          It is probable that most or all of the antipedobaptist churches
          of the Helwys-Murton connection survived the Laudian
          persecutions and others may have arisen after 1632. Thomas Lamb
          was arrested at Colchester for disseminating heresy some time
          before 1640. After his release he resumed his ministry in London
          and is said to have become familiar with nearly every prison in
          London and its vicinity. At the beginning of this period he was
          pastor of a congregation in Bell-alley, which became a fruitful
          mother of churches. In 1643 he was reenforced by Henry Denne,
          who had been educated at Cambridge and was instrumental, with
          Lamb and several other zealous evangelists, in the conversion of
          multitudes in Huntingtonshire, Cambridgeshire, Lincolnshire,
          Kent, and elsewhere. Lamb's church became a missionary society
          which sent forth evangelists into various parts of England and
          into Wales. Between 1641 and 1649 about ten associations are
          supposed to have been established, with quarterly, half-yearly,
          or annual meetings, for edificatory, disciplinary, and
          missionary purposes. Possibly from early connection with the
          Mennonites, the General Baptists emphasized correctional church
          government rather than church independency. Several years before
          1671 a General Assembly of the churches of the entire connection
          had been formed, which usually met in London. The General
          Baptist churches exercised a rigorous discipline over their
          membership in matters of doctrine and life. Persistence in
          Calvinistic teaching (as in denial of the universality of the
          atonement) was a ground of excommunication. Divisive
          controversies on church singing and on the imposition of hands
          occupied a large share of attention. Quakers and Ranters invaded
          the congregations and in some cases were responsible for
          decimating their membership. Divided congregations, churches at
          variance with neighboring churches, and even aggrieved
          individuals could appeal to the associations. The General
          Assembly became virtually a court of appeal from churches and
          associations. An aggrieved member of a church might appeal to
          two or more neighboring churches, which were under obligation to
          hear and judge the case. From such a judgment, appeal might be
          made to the association and from this to the General Assembly.
          Thus every local difficulty was likely to pervade the entire
          connection. Thus equipped with a system of graduated courts of
          appeal, the connection came to feel the need of general
          executive officers, and found the New Testament prototype of
          what they wanted in the apostolate. These officials were called
          "messengers" or "bishops." According to the Orthodox Creed
          (1678), "The bishops have the government of those churches that
          had suffrage in their election, ordinarily, as also to preach
          the word to the world." Thomas Grantham (in Christianismus
          Primitivus, London, 1678), a chief defender of Baptist
          episcopacy, thus defined the office: "1. To plant churches where
          there are none; 2. To set in order such churches as want
          officers to order their affairs; and 3. To assist faithful
          pastors or churches against usurpers and those that trouble the
          peace of particular churches by false doctrines." Grantham
          expressed the wish that representatives of all the baptized
          churches in the world might meet occasionally in a great
          consistory to consider matters of difference among them. The
          Lincolnshire Association in 1775 gave still more ample powers to
          the "messenger," who is said to have "full liberty and
          authority, according to the Gospel, to freely inquire into the
          state of the churches respecting both the pastor and people, to
          see that the pastors do their duty in their places, and the
          people theirs; he is to exhort, admonish, and reprove both the
          one and the other, as occasion calls for. In virtue of his
          office, he is to watch over the several flocks committed to his
          care and charge, . . . to labor to keep out innovations in
          doctrine, worship, and discipline, and to stand up in defense of
          the Gospel."

          The General Baptists were greatly prospered during the Civil
          War, in which they heartily participated, and during the
          Cromwellian period. Along with other dissenters they suffered
          severely under Charles II. After the Revolution (1688-89), owing
          in part to the disciplinary system already described and still
          more to the pervasive influence of Socinianism, disintegration
          set in. The process was accelerated by their resistance to the
          evangelical revival led by the Wesleys and Whitefield. By 1770
          they had dwindled to small proportions and most of those that
          remained had become unitarian.

    § 2. Revival at Barton.

          In 1743 a religious revival occurred in the vicinity of Barton.
          After a time the converts became impressed with the importance
          of immersion and brought a large tub into the meeting-house for
          the dipping of infants. Without any knowledge of Baptists they
          became convinced (1755) that believers only should be baptized
          and they proceeded to introduce baptism anew, Donithrope
          baptizing Kendrick, who in turn baptized his baptizer, and the
          two baptized between sixty and seventy others. Those who did not
          feel the need of a further baptism were allowed to remain in
          communion. Their numbers multiplied until by 1770 six Baptist
          churches with near a thousand members and ten ordained pastors
          had resulted from the movement.

    § 3. The New Connection.

          In 1762 [884]Dan Taylor, a young man of twenty-four, who had
          recently been converted in the Wesleyan meetings and had been
          engaging successfully in evangelistic work in Yorkshire, became
          convinced independently of the unscripturalness of infant
          baptism, left the Wesleyans, and associated himself with four
          others who had had a similar experience at Heptonstall. Having
          reached Baptist convictions and having learned of some General
          Baptists in Lincolnshire, one hundred and twenty miles distant,
          Taylor journeyed in the midst of winter and was baptized by
          Jeffries, pastor of the Gamston church. Taylor proved himself a
          master workman and by 1770 he had founded or rescued from decay
          fifteen churches, which united in forming a "New Connection of
          General Baptist churches, with a design to revive experimental
          religion or primitive Christianity in faith and practise." The
          brief articles of faith combine evangelical Arminianism with
          insistence on believers' baptism (immersion) as indispensable.
          Socinian views of the person of Christ and hyper-Calvinistic
          antinomianism are explicitly condemned. The New Connection
          rigorously excluded from membership General Baptists of the
          older type who would not sign their confession and whose
          ministers failed to come up to their standard of personal
          religious experience. By the close of the eighteenth century the
          New Connection had an academy for the training of ministers, had
          engaged in Sunday-school work, and had started a magazine. Their
          membership had grown to about four thousand. It is probable that
          the General Baptist churches of the older type had about the
          same number of members at the same time.

    § 4. In the Nineteenth Century.

          During the nineteenth century the denomination grew in numbers,
          educational and literary enterprise, and in missionary activity.
          In 1816 they formed a missionary society and entered upon
          foreign work. Their most influential leader at this time was J.
          G. Pike. For many years the General Baptists had joined with the
          Particular Baptists in the Baptist Union and there had been a
          free interchange of pulpits and members. In 1891 a union of
          General and Particular Baptists was effected. Until recent times
          the General Baptists had almost uniformly practised restricted
          communion and rigorously excluded Calvinistic Baptists from the
          Supper. During the nineteenth century their views on this matter
          became assimilated to those of the great majority of the
          Particular Baptists.

  4. Particular Baptists from 1644 Onward:

    § 1. To the Restoration.

          From the date of the signing of the confession of 1644-46,
          Baptists of the Calvinistic type went forward by leaps and
          bounds. Through the evangelistic efforts of John Myles and
          Vavasour Powell Baptists early gained a firm footing in Wales.
          In 1651 four churches met at Carmarthen to consider the
          questions of singing of psalms and the laying-on of hands, and a
          year earlier three of the churches had gathered for consultation
          on missionary business. The meeting of 1650 had voted that each
          church should raise ten pounds for the dissemination of the
          gospel. From this time onward the Welsh Baptists made much of
          associations and these were the prototypes of the Philadelphia
          Association in America (see below, II, 1, § 8). The London
          churches were active in evangelizing the provinces, leading
          ministers spending much time in this kind of work. Baptists of
          both types were soon numerous in the Parliamentary army, many of
          whose officers were of this persuasion (Fleetwood, Cromwell's
          son-in-law and Lord Deputy of Ireland, Major General Harrison,
          Col. Hutchinson, Major Paul Hobson, and others). Baptist
          officers were in several cases effective preachers and most of
          them gave every encouragement to Baptist preaching and the
          establishment of Baptist churches in the neighborhood of the
          camps. The efforts of the Westminster Assembly and of the
          Presbyterian Parliament to check the spread of Baptist
          principles proved ineffective, and Baptists and Independents
          became so powerful in the army that they were able to dissolve
          the Assembly and to cast out the Presbyterian members of
          Parliament. Baptists encouraged Cromwell to assume the headship
          of the state; but they soon grew weary of his military
          government. It seems well established that their determined
          opposition prevented Cromwell from accepting the royal title
          when it was pressed upon him by others. Harrison, who had been
          active in the trial and execution of Charles I, became
          Cromwell's bitter opponent. He embraced socialistic and
          millenarian ideas. John Milton advocated Baptist principles and
          was a stanch antipedobaptist, but there is no evidence that he
          was ever a member of a Baptist church. Among Cromwell's
          "Tryers," appointed to pass upon the qualifications of
          candidates for the pulpits of endowed churches were Henry
          Jessey, Daniel Dyke, and John Tombes, a highly educated
          collegian who wrote and disputed against infant baptism. These
          and about twenty-two other Baptist ministers thought it right to
          accept appointments as pastors of endowed churches, a majority
          of the parishioners in each case petitioning for their services.
          Hanserd Knollys and many other Baptist ministers protested
          against the Court of Tryers as too much like the High Commission
          Court of Laud's time. Besides being one of the most influential
          and devoted pastors of his time, William Kiffin was a successful
          man of affairs and by the liberal use of his wealth promoted the
          Baptist cause.

          It has been noticed that the first Particular Baptist
          congregations were formed by peaceable withdrawal from a
          pedobaptist church and that Jessey remained pastor of a mixed
          church. Open communion was from the first practised by most of
          the churches. Controversy between Kiffin and Bunyan, in which
          the latter denied that differences of opinion and practise
          respecting an external rite should be allowed to hinder the
          manifestation of Christian love and brotherhood in the Supper,
          left the question an open one.

    § 2. Cooperation and Union.

          In 1653 several churches in Ireland that had been formed through
          the labors of London ministers addressed a letter to their
          brethren in London suggesting the desirability of "brotherly
          correspondence" with them and through them "with all the rest of
          the churches of Christ in England, Scotland, and Wales." They
          requested that two or more suitable brethren "visit, comfort,
          and confirm all the flock of our Lord Jesus that are, or have
          given up their names to be, under his rule and government, in
          England, Scotland, and Wales." The London brethren accepted the
          suggestion and messengers were sent out to visit the churches.
          Jessey "was sent by divers churches to visit about thirty-six
          congregations in Essex, Sussex, Norfolk, Middlesex." In the same
          year a circular letter was addressed by many churches in London,
          Wales, etc., to other churches, suggesting the sending of
          messengers to a meeting with a view to harmonizing doctrine and
          practise among the churches and arranging for the approval and
          sending out of teachers. The Western Association was formed the
          same year, the Midland Association in 1655. The Western
          Association in 1655 appointed and ordained Thomas Collier, its
          most influential leader, "General Superintendent and Messenger
          to all the Associated Churches." In 1656 this association
          adopted a confession of faith (the "Somerset") in which the duty
          of the churches individually and collectively to "preach the
          gospel to the world" is asserted, and special recognition is
          made of obligation to labor for the conversion of the Jews. It
          may be worthy of note that Henry Jessey, who was an enthusiastic
          Hebraist, was deeply interested in the Jews of his time and
          raised a considerable amount of money for the relief of the
          persecuted and distressed.

          Particular Baptists as well as General, though probably not to
          so large an extent, suffered much from the intrusion of
          Familists, Seekers, Ranters, and Fifth Monarchy Men.

    § 3. To 1717.

          Baptists promoted the restoration of Charles II and accepted in
          good faith his assurances of toleration. The uprising of the
          [885]Fifth Monarchy Men led by Henry Venner (1661), was the
          occasion of an outbreak of persecution. Twenty-six Baptist
          ministers who had held benefices under the Cromwellian régime
          were deposed through the execution of the Act of Uniformity
          (1662), the least regrettable of the results of the Restoration.
          These ministers, it will be remembered, had been educated in the
          Established Church and no doubt justified themselves in abetting
          a union of Church and State by the practical consideration that
          the funds were available for the support of a ministry and that
          it was bettter for them to do the service to which they were
          invited rather than to leave the people destitute or with
          inferior pastors. The Bill of Indulgence (1675) opened the way
          for efforts to strengthen the ministry of dissenting churches.
          In the same year the Particular Baptist ministers of London
          requested the churches in England and Wales to send
          representatives to meet in London the following May, with a view
          to taking measures for "providing an orderly standing ministry
          in the church, who might give themselves to reading and study,
          and so become able ministers of the New Testament." The meeting
          seems not to have occurred till 1677, when a confession of
          faith, that of the Westminster Assembly with necessary
          modifications, was adopted and formally promulgated. In 1689
          (just after the Revolution and the promulgation of the Act of
          Toleration) representatives of about a hundred churches
          assembled for the expression of fellowship and the reaffirming
          of the confession of 1677. The meeting was most harmonious,
          scarcely a note of dissent being heard. A dearth of properly
          qualified pastors is lamented. During the Civil War and
          Commonwealth times many highly educated ministers from the
          Established Church had joined the Baptist ranks. This source of
          supply had failed. Failure "to make gospel-provision for their
          maintenance" is thought to be one of the reasons why so few
          competent men devote themselves wholly to the work. For
          remedying this defect it was decided to raise "a public stock or
          fund of money," "first by a free-will offering to the Lord; and
          secondly, by a subscription, every one declaring what he is
          willing to give weekly, monthly, or quarterly to it." "A general
          fast in all the congregations" was arranged for, a list of
          "evils to be bewailed and mourned over" is given, and special
          prayer is to be offered for the conversion of "the poor Jews."
          The assembly was careful to disclaim "superiority and
          superintendency over the churches" and determined that in future
          assemblies no differences between churches and persons should be
          debated. Nine London brethren were entrusted with the collection
          and the administration of the fund for the assistance of weak
          churches, the sending forth of missionaries, and the assistance
          of gifted and sound men "in attaining to the knowledge and
          understanding of the languages, Latin, Greek, and Hebrew." The
          question of open or restricted communion was left to the
          churches, each to act in the matter "as they have received from
          the Lord." The assembly of 1691 was made up of representatives
          of a hundred churches belonging to twelve associations. In 1692
          it was decided to divide the assembly, one portion to meet in
          London and the other in Bristol, at different seasons of the
          year, these assemblies not to be accountable to each other and
          each to send messengers to the other. At this time a grievous
          controversy was raging on the question "whether the praises of
          God should be sung in public assemblies," Kiffin, Keach, Cox,
          Steed, and other leading brethren being involved. It was decided
          to refer the matter to seven brethren appointed by the assembly,
          who administered a scathing rebuke to the offenders, which was
          taken in good part. The Bristol meeting prospered, but the
          London meeting declined. The Broadmead church, Bristol, was one
          of the earliest and strongest of the Particular Baptist Churches
          outside of London and the importance of Bristol as a Baptist
          center was greatly enhanced by the endowment left by Edward
          Terrill (d. 1686) with the Broadmead church for ministerial
          education, which became available in 1717. Out of this
          foundation grew the theological college that from its inception
          has been one of the chief factors in the progress of the
          denomination.

    § 4. To 1775.

          In 1717 the London ministers inaugurated another missionary
          fund. The great leaders of the past century had all passed away,
          and there had been a marked decline in the Baptist cause. The
          older assembly with its fund seems to have become extinct.
          Benjamin Stinton, pastor of one of the wealthier churches, and
          the Hollis brothers, wealthy business men, who while
          contributing liberally for the support of Baptist work regularly
          attended Presbyterian services, urged that General Baptists be
          invited to cooperate in the raising and administration of the
          fund and to participate in its use. This cooperation was
          refused, but there was in London at this time a strong sentiment
          in favor of Baptist union. The fund was to be administered by
          representatives of the contributing churches, to be appointed in
          numbers proportioned to their contributions, and individual
          contributors not members of contributing churches participated
          in the management. John Hollis was for years treasurer of the
          fund and left it a large legacy. It may be observed that to the
          Hollis family Harvard University was indebted for endowment and
          equipment. In opposition to this unionistic movement, a "Society
          of Ministers of the Particular Baptist Persuasion" was formed
          1723-24, which for many years exerted a powerful and wide-spread
          influence. By way of reaction against the Socinian teachings
          that were pervading the Established Church and all the
          dissenting bodies, Particular Baptist theologians like John Gill
          and John Brine promulgated a high type of Calvinistic teaching
          that in the minds of the uncultured easily degenerated into
          fatalism and antinomianism. Many Particular Baptist ministers
          went to the extreme of considering it an impertinence to preach
          to the unregenerate or to pray for them, and many churches
          excluded from fellowship any who dissented from their fatalistic
          views. By 1753 there had been such a decline that John Ryland,
          who made a careful inquiry, could find only 4,930 Particular
          Baptists in England and Wales. They opposed the evangelical
          revival with almost fanatical zeal. In the London and Bristol
          centers there remained a number of more moderate pastors and
          churches. In general it may be said that pastors educated at
          Bristol rarely carried their doctrine and practise to the
          fatalistic and antinomian extreme.

    § 5. Andrew Fuller. Missionary Enterprise.

          The conversion of [886]Andrew Fuller to evangelical views,
          chiefly through the reading of a pamphlet by Jonathan Edwards on
          the importance of a general union of Christians in prayer for a
          revival of religion, and through the influence of the
          evangelical revival in England, marks an epoch in the history of
          the Particular Baptists. For a few years before 1792 ministers
          of the Northamptonshire Association, under Fuller's leadership,
          held monthly prayer-meetings for the extension of the gospel. In
          May, 1792, [887]William Carey having become deeply impressed
          with the destitution of the heathen and the duty of Christians
          to carry out the great commission, preached a sermon on the
          topic: "Expect great things from God; attempt great things for
          God," which made a profound impression and led to the
          organization, a few months later (Oct. 2), at Kettering
          (Fuller's church) of the Baptist Missionary Society. From this
          time onward Fuller devoted much of his time and effort to the
          diffusion of the missionary spirit throughout his denomination
          and among dissenters and churchmen. He visited from time to time
          all parts of Britain in the interest of Carey's mission. His
          popular but profound publications disseminated moderate
          Calvinistic views suffused with missionary enthusiasm. Not since
          the Cromwellian age were Baptist principles brought to the
          attention of the religious public in so acceptable a manner.
          Closely associated with Fuller was [888]John Ryland, who in 1783
          became pastor of the Broadmead church, Bristol, and Principal of
          the Baptist College. For thirty years he exerted a wide-spread
          influence as pastor and teacher. Among the students that went
          forth from the college were [889]John Foster and [890]Robert
          Hall. Fuller's chief Baptist opponents were Abraham Booth, who
          from being a General Baptist became a Particular Baptist of the
          more rigorous type and wrote largely in defense of believers'
          baptism, restricted communion, and high Calvinism ("Reign of
          Grace"), and Alexander Maclean, leader of the Scotch Baptists.
          The successful inauguration of missionary work in India and
          Carey's achievements in the acquisition of Oriental languages
          and in Bible translation gave the denomination a prestige and
          popular acceptance that it had not before enjoyed. By 1801 the
          Particular Baptists had increased to 29,000.

          The work of the denomination in Foreign Missions was greatly
          prospered, and commanded enthusiastic support. India, Ceylon,
          China, Palestine Africa, the Bahamas, Trinidad, San Domingo,
          Turk's Island, and Italy are the present beneficiaries. At an
          earlier date Jamaica was evangelized by this body. The present
          annual income of the Foreign Missionary Society is about
          £100,000. It supports about three hundred missionaries and
          evangelists and has about 20,000 members in its mission
          churches.

    § 6. Baptist Union.

          About 1812 a conviction was expressed by a writer in the Baptist
          Magazine that, while numerically strong, the Baptists of England
          and Wales exerted little influence because of their lack of
          union. "Union of the most extensive, firm, and durable nature"
          was earnestly advocated by him. A number of brethren met in
          London the same year to plan for a union. Particular Baptists
          contended much more strenuously than General Baptists for church
          independency, and the recognition of the fullest independence of
          the local churches was indispensable. Among the principal
          promoters of the enterprise were Joseph Ivimey, the historian,
          Drs. Ryland and Rippon, of London, and James Hinton, of Oxford.
          The union did not at once take firm hold on the denominational
          life or become a marked success. But the great religious and
          political upheaval of the third and fourth decades of the
          nineteenth century (Reform bills, Catholic Emancipation,
          abolition of Corporation and Test Acts, Hampden Controversy,
          Tractarian Controversy, etc.) aroused Baptists anew to the
          importance of making their influence felt and the Union grew in
          importance. The determined and successful Romanizing propaganda
          of the Oxford school and the disruption (1843) of the Scottish
          Church encouraged English dissenters to believe that
          disestablishment was possible in England and led to concerted
          efforts for religious equality. At the formation of the
          Anti-State-Church Association (1844) Baptists were the only
          religious body represented. In the recent agitation against the
          education act, [891]Dr. John Clifford was the recognized leader
          and to him and his free church coadjutors was largely due the
          victory of the Liberal party in 1906.

          Through the enthusiastic advocacy of Robert Robinson and Robert
          Hall, and other favoring influences, open communion became
          widely prevalent in England early in the nineteenth century. In
          Wales, however, restricted communion has always prevailed. In
          1845 a number of "Strict Baptist" churches formed the Baptist
          Evangelical Society under the leadership of Dr. John Stock. This
          society undertook missionary work in Germany and founded a
          theological college at Manchester. The most eminent English
          Baptist leaders of the present day carry their liberality so far
          as to practise open or mixed membership. Alexander Maclaren, the
          famous Manchester preacher was for many years pastor of a mixed
          church. The same is true of Dr. Clifford. F. B. Meyer, president
          of the Baptist Union, 1905-06, was for some years pastor of a
          pedobaptist congregation in London.

    § 7. Charles Haddon Spurgeon.

          The coming of Charles Haddon Spurgeon to the pulpit of New Park
          Street Church, London, in 1854, marks an epoch in the history of
          British Baptists. Within a few years he became recognized as one
          of the greatest of preachers. That he built up a church of six
          thousand members, preached regularly in the Metropolitan
          Tabernacle to 7,000 people with a large overflow, that he
          reached through his published sermons millions of people
          throughout the world, represent only a small part of his
          beneficent activity. From his Pastor's College hundreds of young
          men went forth as pastors into all parts of Britain and
          throughout the world, and it is estimated that considerably over
          a hundred thousand have been added to churches pastored by
          Spurgeon's students. The Stockwell Orphanage founded by Spurgeon
          has set an example to Baptists and others in practical
          philanthropy. His Book Fund supplied the needs of multitudes of
          pastors. His magazine and his popular writings multiplied his
          influence. The last years of Mr. Spurgeon (1884-92) were
          somewhat embittered by a controversy in which he became engaged
          with the Baptist Union because of its toleration of liberal
          views on the Scriptures, the person of Christ, the atonement,
          future punishment, etc. His own Puritan convictions made him
          incapable of seeing anything but the abomination of desolation
          in less rigorous modes of thought that had become widely
          prevalent. When the Union refused to exclude from its fellowship
          those whose teachings he regarded as unsound he severed his
          connection with this body and was followed by many of his former
          students and the churches to which they ministered.

    § 8. The Welsh Baptists.

          The Baptists of Wales suffered much during the first half of the
          eighteenth century from hyper-Calvinism, but the religious
          fervor of the race was too great to be completely quenched. More
          promptly than the English Baptists, they responded to the
          quickening influences of the evangelical revival, especially to
          the Calvinistic phase of it represented by Whitefield. During
          the latter part of the century Sandemanianism and Socinianism
          made some headway among them. The teachings of Andrew Fuller
          finally prevailed, and the spirit of evangelism attained to a
          fervor among Welsh Baptist preachers Baptists rarely surpassed.
          [892]Christmas Evans was from 1791 onward by far the greatest
          evangelizing force. Anglesea was the chief scene of his labors,
          but he is said to have traversed Wales forty times on preaching
          tours and to have preached one hundred and sixty-three
          associational sermons. Many other men of power carried forward
          throughout Wales the work in which Evans was the chief prophet.
          Pontypool College (1836) grew out of earlier efforts at
          ministerial education. Haverfordwest College was founded in 1839
          and Llabollen College in 1862. Like the English denominational
          colleges these are small institutions in which two or three
          teachers instruct twenty or thirty students for the ministry.
          The Welsh churches, while retaining for home work a liberal
          share of scholarly ministers have sent to England and America
          many of their brightest and best. The Philadelphia Association
          has profited largely by Welsh talent and consecration. The Welsh
          Baptists at present number nearly 150,000, nearly 30,000 having
          been added within the past year and a half as a result of the
          great revival of 1904-05.

    § 9. Alexander Carson and the Irish Baptists.

          The Baptist churches planted in Ireland in the Cromwellian time
          by Thomas Patient and other London Baptists either became
          entirely extinct or survived in a very feeble way. About 1803
          [893]Alexander Carson, who had been graduated a few years before
          from the University of Glasgow and was pastor of a Presbyterian
          church at Tubbermore with ample state support, reached
          convictions in favor of congregational church government and
          believers' baptism so strong that he gave up his living and the
          prospect of a Glasgow professorship. With a few like-minded
          believers he organized a Baptist church which during his forty
          years of service grew to a membership of 500. His best-known
          work is his treatise on baptism, but his doctrinal and
          controversial writings are numerous. He is said to have
          contributed the scholarship to Haldane's commentary on Romans.
          He was closely associated with the Haldanes. Like the Scottish
          Baptists, Carson practised weekly communion. He also followed
          the Scriptural injunction "salute one another with a holy kiss,"
          himself kissing one of the deacons, and others following his
          example. After the sermon the brethren were encouraged to
          exhort. He was frequently called to Scotland and England for
          sermons and addresses. Since Carson's time English Baptists have
          devoted much effort to the propagation of Baptist principles in
          Ireland with small numerical results.

    § 10. Scotch Baptists. The Haldanes.

          In Scotland also the Baptist movement that flourished in
          Cromwell's time failed of maintenance. In the eighteenth century
          Sir William Sinclair of Keiss, Caithness, who had been baptized
          while visiting England, gained a number of adherents in his own
          neighborhood, whom he baptized and organized into a church
          (about 1750). This is the oldest Baptist church in Scotland. In
          1765 Robert Carmichael, a Sandemanian minister of Glasgow, was
          baptized in London by John Gill. He baptized several members of
          his former church and organized them into a Baptist church.
          Archibald McLean, who had been a member of Carmichael's church
          in Glasgow, joined his former pastor in Edinburgh, was baptized
          by him, became his co-laborer, and succeeded him (1769) with Dr.
          Robert Walker as coelder. McLean was a vigorous and somewhat
          voluminous writer, and his works (published in seven volumes,
          1805) have exerted a profound influence on Scottish Baptist life
          and thought. By far the most important factor in the history of
          Scottish Bap tists was the conversion to evangelical principles,
          and then to Baptist views, of [894]Robert and James Alexander
          Haldane. The former was deeply interested in religious and
          philanthropical matters from 1793 onward, and in fifteen years
          spent $350 000 in educating and supporting evangelists, building
          chapels, circulating religious literature, etc. In 1799 James
          became pastor of an In dependent church in Edinburgh and in 1801
          his brother built for the church a large tabernacle in which he
          ministered for fifty years. In 1808 both became avowed Baptists,
          and from this time onward, while conducting their work on
          somewhat broad lines, were highly influential in the propagation
          of Baptist principles. Christopher Anderson was converted under
          the ministry of James Haldane (1799). Through the influence of
          English Baptist students at the University of Edinburgh he
          became a Baptist, and was excluded therefor from Haldane's
          church. He was persuaded by Andrew Fuller to enter the ministry
          and in 1806 led in the founding of a regular Baptist church in
          Edinburgh, where he soon preached to overflowing congregations.
          His ministry of thirty years greatly strengthened the Baptist
          cause in Scotland. Anderson's church practised restricted
          communion and did not, like most Scottish Baptist churches, have
          plurality of elders or weekly communion. Among the most noted
          preachers of the Scottish Baptist churches, some of whom labored
          exclusively in Scotland while others did so in England, may be
          named Drs. Patterson, Landels, Culross, and Alexander Maclaren.
          Scottish Baptists have never gained great numerical strength,
          their present membership being less than 21,000. The Baptists of
          Great Britain number at present about 500,000, which, in view of
          the constant drain upon the membership by emigration, is a very
          creditable showing. This estimate takes account of about 400
          unassociated churches. One of their greatest achievements was
          the raising of the £250,000 twentieth Century Fund for home and
          foreign work.

II. Baptists in the United States.

  1. To 1740

    § 1. Roger Williams.

          About March, 1638, [895]Roger Williams, having been banished
          from Massachusetts two years before because of agitation against
          the charter, advocacy of extreme Separatist views,
          insubordination on conscientious grounds to the theocratic
          authorities, etc., and having settled on Narragansett Bay, felt
          it his duty, in cooperation with a dozen likeminded men and
          women who had followed him from Massachusetts, to introduce
          believers' baptism anew and to organize independently a new
          church on the apostolic model. Ezekiel Holliman first baptized
          Williams, who in turn baptized Holliman and the rest of the
          party. Winthrop attributes Williams's antipedobaptiat views to
          the influence of the wife of Richard Scott, a sister of Mrs.
          Anne Hutchinson, the antinomian agitator (see [896]Antinomianism
          and Antinomian Controversies, II, 2)). He was already familiar
          with the opinions of the Mennonites and probably also with those
          of the followers of Smyth and Helwys and the contemporary
          Calvinistic antipedobaptists of London. He had reached the
          conviction that the ordinances and church order of the apostolic
          time had been lost by apostasy and, for the time, he was
          persuaded that a company of true believers had the right to
          restore them; but he did not long rest in this conviction. To
          the end of his life he maintained that true churches could only
          be constituted of regenerate members baptized upon a profession
          of their faith, and on many occasions expressed the conviction
          that in doctrine and practise the Baptists were nearer than
          others to the apostolic norm; yet after a few months of
          experience he became so doubtful as to the warrantableness of
          what he had done, that he felt constrained to withdraw from the
          fellowship of the church he had founded and to spend the rest of
          his life as a "[897]Seeker". Nothing short of a miraculously
          given commission to restore the ordinances would thenceforth
          meet his requirement. It wasafter he had assumed this position
          that he gained immortality of fame as an advocate of liberty of
          conscience and as, in cooperation with [898]John Clarke, the
          founder of a state in which this doctrine was embodied to an
          extent never before known.

    § 2. The Providence Church.

          For some years little is known of the career of the little
          church. The principle of individualism was so emphasized in the
          Providence community that complete harmony among the members of
          the church could hardly have been expected. Within a few years
          several who had been members of antipedobaptist churches in
          England (probably of the Arminian type) seem to have reenforced
          the constituent members and to have introduced elements of
          discord. Among the Arminian members, afterward to become
          somewhat prominent, were William Wickenden, Gregory Dexter, and
          Chad Brown, who, like many of the English General Baptists
          insisted upon the laying-on of hands after baptism as a
          Christian ordinance and an indispensable qualification for
          church-fellowship. William himself regarded the laying on of
          hands as an ordinance of Christ. Thomas Olney, one of the
          constituent members, probably succeeded William in leadership,
          and by 1652 was coelder along with the brethren named. By this
          time diversities of opinion as to the extent of Christ's
          redemptive work and the laying-on of hands had become so
          pronounced as to occasion a schism. Olney led the faction that
          opposed the laying-on of hands as an ordinance and probably
          insisted on limited redemption, while Brown, Wickenden, and
          Dexter, on the basis of Heb. vi, 1-2, led the party, probably a
          majority, that insisted on the laying-on of hands as one of the
          "Six Principles." The fact that Olney's party did not survive as
          a church has led to the claim on behalf of the Newport church,
          organized some years later than the original Providence church,
          of priority among surviving churches. But the party led by Brown
          and the others seem equally entitled to be regarded as the
          original church. Wickenden extended his labors to New York
          State, where he was imprisoned (1656) for baptizing and
          administering the Lord's Supper. By 1669 his Arminianism had
          developed into Socinianism greatly to the alarm of William. He
          died in 1670. Gregory Dexter, who had printed Williams's Key to
          the Indian Language (1643) in London, removed to Providence
          about 1644. He was probably a General Baptist before his
          emigration. He became one of the most prominent men in the
          colony (President, 1653). Brown was for about twenty-five years
          a pillar among the Providence Baptists. He is of special
          interest as the ancestor of the Browns who gave their name to
          the first Baptist College in America and have done so much for
          its endowment and equipment (see below, II, 2, § 3).

    § 3. The Newport Church.

          The First Baptist Church of Newport owes its origin to [899]John
          Clarke, an educated Englishman who arrived at Boston in Nov.,
          1637, and cast in his lot with a company of Antinomians (Anne
          Hutchinson, Wheelwright, Coddington, and others), who were
          leaving Massachusetts for conscience' sake and who through
          William's good offices secured from the Indians the island of
          Aquidneck (Rhode Island), where they organized a colony (Mar.,
          1638) with recognition of Jesus Christ as King of Kings and Lord
          of Lords. The first agreement was theocratic, but in 1641 a
          distinctly democratic constitution with full provision for
          liberty of conscience was adopted. Clarke was equally prominent
          with Williams in the later political history of the united
          colonies that became Rhode Island, and, like Williams, spent
          much time in England in the public interest. As early as the
          year 1638 Governor John Winthrop designated Clarke as "a
          physician and preacher to those of the island." By 1640-41
          strife had arisen between Clarke, Lenthall, Harding, and others,
          and Easton, Coddington, Coggeshall, and others, the latter
          maintaining the antinomian views of Anne Hutchinson, the former
          repudiating these views and probably at this time objecting to
          the baptism of infants. Winthrop wrote of the presence of
          "professed Anabaptists" on the island in 1641. There is no
          direct proof of the organization of Clarke's followers on a
          Baptist basis until 1644 or a little later. Mark Lukar, who was
          among those baptized by Blount and Blacklock in London in
          1641-42, was for many years one of the most influential members
          of the Newport church. The date of his arrival has not been
          ascertained. If he arrived in 1644, as seems probable, he may
          have been a constituent member and have led in the introduction
          of believers' baptism. Samuel Hubbard, a friend of Roger
          Williams and a man of intelligence and force of character,
          removed from Connecticut in 1648, where he had adopted
          antipedobaptist views and was baptized into the fellowship of
          the church. In 1665 Stephen Mumford, an English Seventh-Day
          Baptist; became a member of this church and won to his views
          Hubbard, Hiscox, and others. Failing to carry the majority of
          the church for Sabbatarianism, they withdrew in 1671 and formed
          a separate congregation. In 1649 Obadiah Holmes of Seekonk,
          Mass., near the Rhode Island border, was baptized into the
          fellowship of the church and with a number of other persons
          attempted to carry on Baptist work in the Seekonk neighborhood.
          Civil interference with their meetings led them to remove to
          Newport. In 1651 Clarke, Holmes, and Crandall visited Lynn,
          Mass., to minister to some antipedobaptists there. They were
          imprisoned, heavily fined, and Holmes, for refusing on principle
          to pay the fine, was cruelly whipped. In 1652 Clarke published
          in England Ill News from New England, a full account of this act
          of persecution with a somewhat elaborate argument for liberty of
          conscience. The division of sentiment among the Providence
          Baptists on the laying-on of hands extended to the Newport
          church, which had been strictly Calvinistic. William Vaughan, a
          member of the church, went to Providence in 1652 and submitted
          to the rite. Wickenden and Dexter accompanied him to Newport and
          a number were convinced in favor of the "Six Principles." In
          1656 a division occurred. From this time onward until the Great
          Awakening Baptist progress in New England was almost confined to
          the General (Six Principles) type. Several churches were formed
          in Rhode Island, Connecticut, and southern Massachusetts, and
          associational meetings were held among them early in the
          eighteenth century.

    § 4. Baptists in Massachusetts.

          In Massachusetts a rigorous law was enacted (1644) against
          "Anabaptists," whose presence was supposed to imperil civil and
          religious order, banishment being the penalty for openly
          condemning or opposing the baptism of infants or secretly
          propagating Anabaptist principles. The law was put into
          execution in a number of cases before the persecutions at
          Seekonk and Lynn mentioned above. In 1646 Winslow stated that in
          one of the churches of the Plymouth settlement (presumably that
          of Chauncy at Scituate) the pastor "waiveth the administration
          of baptism to infants." Remonstrance on the part of the synod
          seems to have led to the resumption of infant baptism, though
          this future president of the college at Cambridge continued to
          insist upon immersion. About 1652 or 1653 Henry Dunster, the
          highly efficient first president of the college at Cambridge
          (1640 onward), became so profoundly impressed against infant
          baptism that he did not feel at liberty longer to keep his views
          in abeyance, and after many conferences with the overseers and
          ample warning he was obliged at great sacrifice of sentiment and
          material good to relinquish his position. The patience of the
          authorities and their willingness for him to continue in the
          office provided he would cease to agitate against infant baptism
          speak well for their tolerant spirit. The influence of Dunster
          is clearly manifest in the movement for the founding of the
          First Baptist church of Boston under the leadership of Thomas
          Gould (1655). In 1663 John Myles, a Welsh Baptist minister who
          had acted as one of Cromwell's Tryers for Wales, driven from his
          post by the Act of Uniformity (1662), came with his congregation
          to Massachusetts and secured a tract of land in Rehoboth, near
          the Rhode Island border. Partly because of their remoteness from
          churches of the standing order and partly perhaps because they
          were less aggressive than most Baptists in their condemnation of
          the union of Church and State, they suffered little molestation
          until 1667 and even then they were permitted to continue their
          worship on condition of holding their meetings at a greater
          distance from the Rehoboth congregational meeting-house. Myles
          proved himself a man of power and built up at Swansea in
          Rehoboth a vigorous church of the Calvinistic type. He also gave
          valuable assistance to the Boston brethren after they had
          secured a measure of toleration. Organization was not effected
          by the Boston antipedobaptists until 1665, when Thomas Gould and
          three others were baptized and joined with Richard Goodall and
          four others who had been baptized in England. In spite of
          persecution this faithful body grew to considerable size. Even
          after the Act of Toleration (1689) had come into force in
          England, intolerance held sway in Boston. In 1680 John Russel,
          an officer of the church, published in London, with an "Address
          to the Christian Reader" by Kiffin, Dyke, Collins, Knollys,
          Harris, and Cox, A Brief Narrative of some considerable passages
          concerning the first gathering and further progress of a Church
          of Christ, in Gospel Order, in Boston in New England, commonly
          (though falsely) called by the name of Anabaptists, for clearing
          their innocency from the scandalous things laid to their charge
          (reprinted in Wood's History of the First Baptist Church in
          Boston). English Congregationalists, and English Baptists,
          protested in vain against the intolerance of the Massachusetts
          authorities in dealing with the Boston Baptists, partly because
          of the justification that it would seem to furnish to the home
          government for the persecution of non-conformists. A Six
          Principle church was formed at Swansea in 1693, and in 1732 a
          Baptist church was formed in Rehoboth by John Comer, the able
          pastor of the original Newport church, who had left his charge
          because of his adoption of the doctrine and practise of
          laying-on of hands, but had remained a Calvinist. Indian Baptist
          churches were formed by 1694 on Martha's Vineyard and Nantucket
          Island through the labors of Peter Foulger, of the First Baptist
          church of Newport, and others. In 1735 through the influence of
          Comer a church was organized at Sutton, Mass., from which, by
          friendly division, the Leicester church was formed in 1738. The
          Brimfield, Mass., church was gathered and organized through
          Ebenezer Moulton in 1736.

    § 5. In South Carolina.

          In 1682 some members of the Boston church who had settled at
          Kittery, Me., sought and obtained the cooperation of the church
          in the organization of a new church at that place. The leaders
          were Humphrey Churchwood and William Screven. The latter was
          approved as a minister by the parent church and became pastor of
          the new body. Persecution soon broke up the Kittery church. In
          1683 or 1684 Screven made his way to South Carolina, accompanied
          or followed by several of the members, and settled on the Ashley
          river, a short distance from the place where Charleston was
          about to be founded. About 1683 a colony of Britons, among whom
          were several Baptists, had settled on Port Royal island. At
          about the same time a large company from Somersetshire, England.
          including several Baptists of intelligence and social rank (Lady
          Blake and Lady Axtell), settled in the Charleston neighborhood
          and became members of the church at Somerton with Screven as
          pastor. In 1693 the church was removed to Charleston, which was
          assuming commercial importance. Screven died in 1713 leaving the
          church with a membership of nearly a hundred. Through his zeal,
          preaching stations had been established at a number of points
          and something practical had been done for the evangelization of
          the negro slaves. In 1733 a schism occurred that resulted in the
          organization of a General Baptist church, and in 1736 members
          residing in the Ashley river community withdrew to form a church
          of their own. This greatly weakened the Charleston church and by
          the close of the present period it had become almost extinct. In
          1737 a company of Welsh Baptists from Welsh Tract, Pa. (now
          Delaware), settled on the Peedee river, S. C., and formed the
          Welsh Neck church.

    § 6. In Virginia, North Carolina, and Connecticut.

          In 1714, in response to an appeal from some Baptists in Isle of
          Wight County, Va., Robert Nordin was sent out by the General
          Baptists of London. He succeeded in organizing a church at
          Burleigh and another in Surrey county. In 1727 a Baptist church
          was formed in northern North Carolina under the leadership of
          Paul Palmer, who had been a member of the Welsh Tract church and
          who was presumably Calvinistic. In Connecticut, through the
          labors of Valentine Wightman, Stephen Gorton, and others,
          General (Six Principles) Baptist churches were constituted at
          Groton (1705), New London (1726), Wallingford (1735), and
          Farmington (now Southington) a little later. These were closely
          associated with the General Baptist churches of Providence,
          Newport, South Kingston, and Dartmouth, R. I.

    § 7. In New York.

          In 1643 Lady Moody, who had become a zealous antipedobaptist,
          left Massachusetts and settled at Gravesend, N. Y. On her way
          she spent some time in New Haven, where she won to her views the
          wife of Theophilus Eaton, first governor of the colony and
          daughter of an English bishop. For many years religious services
          were held by Lady Moody without regular church organization.
          Francis Doughty, driven from Massachusetts on account of
          antipedobaptist views, labored for a while at Flushing and left
          for Virginia in 1656 without effecting a church organization. In
          1656 William Wickenden, of Providence, preached, baptized, and
          celebrated the Lord's Supper at Flushing, but was driven away
          after imprisonment and an attempt to collect from him a heavy
          fine. From 1711 onward Valentine Wightman, of Connecticut
          (General Baptist), frequently visited New York on the invitation
          of Nicholas Eyres, a prosperous brewer, who with others was
          baptized by Wightman in 1714. Eyres became pastor of the
          congregation. He was ordained and the church recognized by
          brethren from Rhode Island and Connecticut in 1724. This church
          became involved in debt and controversy (Arminianism vs.
          Calvinism) and was extinct before the close of this period. At
          Oyster Bay, L. I., there were Baptists from 1700 onward. A
          Baptist church (probably General) was constituted a little
          later.

    § 8. In the Quaker Colonies.

          The Quaker colonies furnished an attractive field for Baptist
          effort. The first Baptist church founded in this section was
          that at Cold Spring (1684) through the labors of Thomas Dungan,
          an Irish minister who had been a member of the First Church,
          Newport. This church became extinct by 1702. The Lower Dublin,
          or Pennepek, church followed in 1688. Several families of Welsh
          Baptists, with one Irish and one English Baptist, had settled in
          the neighborhood two years earlier. Elias Keach, the prodigal
          son of the famous Benjamin Keach, of London, was converted while
          practising imposture upon the brethren and became a preacher of
          power. Under his leadership the Pennepek church was organized in
          1688, and in a few years through his evangelistic efforts
          baptized believers were to be found at the Falls, Cold Spring,
          Burlington, Cohansey, Salem, Penn's Neck, Chester, Philadelphia,
          and other places, who continued to be members of the Pennepek
          church enjoying occasional preaching services and gathering
          quarterly at different places for evangelistic services and
          communion. Keach returned to England in 1692. Here also
          controversy arose respecting the laying-on of hands and
          occasioned Keach's withdrawal in 1689 from the pastorate of the
          church. The laying-on of hands became the common practise of the
          churches of the Philadelphia Association, but was never a term
          of communion. Churches were formed in the following places:
          Piscataqua, N. J. (1689), Middletown, N. J. (1688), Cohansey, N.
          J. (1691), Philadelphia (1698), Welsh Tract, Del. (1703), Great
          Valley, Pa. (1711). The Welsh element prevailed, but many of the
          members of the churches were English and not a few had had New
          England experience. Many Mennonites settled in this region and
          reenforced the antipedobaptist life; so also the Dunkers.
          Baptists in Philadelphia were considerably strengthened
          (1692-1700) by the conversion to their views of a number of
          Keithian Quakers. Some of these were constituent members of the
          church and in 1707 the Keithians invited the Baptists to share
          the use of their meeting-house. Seventh-Day Baptists early
          appeared in this region and churches were organized by them at
          Piscataqua (1705), Newtown (1700), and Shiloh (1737). In 1707
          churches which from the beginning had held general meetings
          together joined in organizing the Philadelphia Association, than
          which no agency has been so potent in the unification and
          extension of the denominational life. The adoption, with
          modifications, by the Association of the English Particular
          Baptist Confession of Faith of 1689 tended to fix the doctrinal
          type of what was long the most aggressive aggregation of
          Baptists in America. Before the Great Awakening the Baptists of
          the Philadelphia Association were carrying on successful
          missionary work.

  2. From 1740 to 1821:

    § 1. The Great Awakening.

          A Socinianized Arminianism long before the beginning of this
          period had wrecked a number of the older Calvinistic Baptist
          churches. As in England, so in America, evangelical religion was
          at a low ebb during the first third of the eighteenth century.
          The Great Awakening (see [900]Revivals of Religion) found the
          Baptists wholly unprepared to cooperate. The Arminian Baptists
          were repelled by the Calvinistic teachings of the great
          evangelists, while Baptists of all parties had suffered so much
          at the hands of pedobaptists that they would have been
          disinclined to join heartily in any general Christian movement.
          Yet no denomination profited more largely by the revival of
          religion. A considerable number of "New Light" churches which
          had been formed by way of separation from churches of the
          standing order that opposed the revival, or in new communities
          from the products of the new evangelism, came to feel that the
          practise of infant baptism was inconsistent with their demand
          for regenerate membership. In many cases "New Great Light"
          churches were divided in opinion respecting infant baptism and
          mutual toleration of each others' opinions was agreed upon.
          Convictions proved too strong to allow mixed churches long to
          persist and separation proved inevitable. Among the most
          valuable accessions to the Baptist ranks from this source was
          Isaac Backus (d. 1806), who was for many years the champion of
          the denomination in the cause of religious equality and wrote a
          meritorious history of the New England Baptists. Hezekiah Smith
          (d. 1805) after his graduation at Princeton (1762) wrought as an
          evangelist in South Carolina and more largely in New England.
          While pastor of the Haverhill (Mass.) church he devoted a large
          share of his time to evangelistic effort and to the collection
          of funds for the support of Rhode Island College. The First
          Church of Boston, under the influence of Jeremy Condy (pastor
          1739-65), had become Arminian (Socinian) in sentiment and
          strongly opposed the revival. Under the well educated and
          eloquent Samuel Stillman (pastor after 1765) the. church
          regained its evangelical zeal and its high standing among the
          churches. In 1769 the membership of the church was more than
          doubled. Under the influence of the Great Awakening a number of
          brethren led by Ephraim Bound formed a second Baptist church
          (1743). Valentine Wightman, one of the very few Baptists of the
          older sort who had entered heartily into the revival movement,
          assisted in the ordination of Bound. The Swansea and Rehoboth
          churches held resolutely aloof from the revival movement and
          would have no fellowship with the New Light brethren until 1771
          when several hundred were added to their membership through
          evangelistic effort. Some of the converts formed a new church at
          Rehoboth which practised open communion. At about the same time
          the "New Light" Congregational church of Rehoboth suffered
          schism, Elhanan Winchester, a baptized evangelist, becoming
          pastor of the antipedobaptist party which organized on an open
          communion basis. Winchester refused to administer the Supper to
          any but baptized believers and was excommunicated. He afterward
          became a Universalist leader. A third open communion church was
          formed in this region in 1777.

    § 2. The Philadelphia Association.

          The churches of the Philadelphia Association had reached a
          position of assured strength that enabled them to assert their
          principles with the utmost decision while maintaining the most
          friendly relations with their brethren of other denominations.
          The growth of the churches of Pennsylvania and New Jersey during
          this period was only normal. The Philadelphia Association, being
          long the only body of the sort among the Calvinistic Baptists,
          had by 1762 extended its influence so as to embrace churches in
          New England, New York, Virginia, and Maryland. At this time the
          association comprised only twenty-nine churches with a
          membership of 1,318. The territory of the association was
          covered by the evangelizing activity of the Tennents and the
          Presbyterian discipline was so effective that few of the
          converts became Baptists. In 1756 measures were taken by the
          association for the establishment of a grammar-school under the
          care of Isaac Eaton, at Hopewell, N..J.

    § 3. Rhode Island College (Brown University).

          About 1762, members of the association under the leadership of
          Morgan Edwards began to agitate and plan for the establishment
          of a Baptist College. The graduation of James Manning and
          Hezekiah Smith at this time from Princeton and the availability
          of the former for educational work may have brought the matter
          to an issue. Rhode Island was selected as the most promising
          location for a college because of its men of eminence, its
          central position, its lack of a college, and its devotion to
          civil and religious liberty. In 1663 Manning was sent to Rhode
          Island to confer with leading brethren there. In 1764 a charter
          was secured, which, while giving control to the Baptists,
          provided for the participation in the government of the
          institution of Quakers, Congregationalists, and Episcopalians.
          The charter provides: "Into this liberal and catholic
          institution shall never be admitted any religious tests. But, on
          the contrary, all the members hereof shall forever enjoy full,
          free, absolute, and uninterrupted liberty of conscience; and the
          places of professors, tutors, and all other officers, the
          president alone excepted, shall be free and open for all
          denominations of Protestants . . . and that sectarian
          differences shall not make any part of the public and classical
          instruction." The trustees and fellows included the most
          prominent men of the various denominations. Morgan Edwards
          visited England on behalf of the college and Hezekiah Smith made
          a canvass of the South. It was arranged that pending the raising
          of funds Manning should minister to a few Baptist families at
          Warren and conduct there a grammar-school (1764). In 1765
          Manning was appointed president and in 1769 seven young men
          received the bachelor's degree--the first academic degrees ever
          conferred by a Baptist institution. In 1804 Rhode Island College
          became Brown University and under this name has steadily grown
          in equipment and influence. Among its presidents have been
          Francis Wayland, Barnas Sears, Alexis Caswell, E. G. Robinson,
          E. B. Andrews, and W. H. P. Faunce.

          As a result of the influence of the Baptists of the Philadelphia
          Association, the Warren Association was formed in 1767. The
          moving spirits were James Manning and Hezekiah Smith. Only four
          churches participated in its organization, Isaac Backus and many
          of the "New Light" brethren as well as all of the older churches
          holding aloof from fear lest the body should "assume any
          jurisdiction over the churches." The influence of the Warren
          Association was soon felt and became mighty in favor of
          education, evangelization, and religious liberty.

    § 4. Southern Associations.

          In 1749 Oliver Hart from the Philadelphia Association went to
          Charleston, S. C., where he was influential in reviving the
          Baptist cause and in forming the Charleston Association after
          the model of the Philadelphia. From 1742 onward members of the
          Philadelphia Association (Gano, Vanhorn, Miller, Thomas) visited
          the scattered and unorganized Baptists of Virginia and North
          Carolina, won some Arminians to Calvinism, introduced better
          church discipline, and secured the organization (1765) of the
          Kehukee Association, composed of churches in Virginia and North
          Carolina. Through the labors of David Thomas, also a gift of the
          Philadelphia Association, several churches were constituted in
          the Northern Neck of Virginia and in 1766 formed the Ketokton
          Association with the approval and cooperation of the
          Philadelphia. This association adopted the Philadelphia
          Confession, with its requirement of the laying-on of hands.

    § 5. Evangelism Work of Stearns and Marshall.

          Of momentous importance for the diffusion of Baptist principles
          throughout the South was the enthusiastic evangelism of Shubael
          Stearns and Daniel Marshall, "New Light" Baptists from New
          England (1754 onward). Stearns had become a Baptist in New
          England (1751) and had felt an irresistible impulse to devote
          his life to missionary work in the South. Marshall was led to
          Baptist views after his arrival in Virginia from contact with
          Baptists of the Philadelphia Association type. Within the next
          thirty years multitudes were converted and accepted Baptist
          views through their ministry, and churches were organized in
          Virginia., North Carolina, South Carolina, and Georgia. The
          Sandy Creek (N. C.) church was organized by Stearns in 1755 and
          in a few years it had over 600 members. In 1758 the Sandy Creek
          Association was formed, which for years embraced all the
          churches of the Separate type in the South. In seventeen years
          the connection had grown to forty-two churches with 125
          ministers. The evangelism of Steams and Marshall was
          characterized by an enthusiasm that verged upon fanaticism. Many
          new converts, without previous educational equipment or
          subsequent training, entered zealously upon the work of
          evangelization and the people heard with gladness their uncouth
          but earnest testimony to the power of the Gospel.

    § 6. Separate Baptists in Virginia.

          Because of their fiery enthusiasm and their unwillingness to
          take out licenses and conform to the Colonial conditions of
          toleration the Separate Baptists of Virginia suffered much
          persecution in genuine martyr fashion and thereby won for
          themselves great, popular acceptance and made the episcopal
          establishment highly odious. Virginia Baptists of the older type
          conformed to the laws and suffered little persecution, and
          looked with disfavor upon the Separate Bapists as unduly
          enthusiastic and as allowing untrained and untried men (and even
          women) freely to evangelize. Stearns was disposed to lay more
          stress on the interdependence than the independence of the
          numerous and widely scattered churches of the Sandy Creek
          Association. Under his influence overtures from the Regular
          Baptists for the union of Regulars and Separates were rejected
          (1767) by a small majority. By 1770 many churches and ministers
          of the association had become dissatisfied with the rigorous
          ruling of Stearns and insisted upon the division of the body
          into three associations. The result was the formation of the
          General Association of Separate Baptists, for Virginia, and the
          Rapid-Ann Association, for South Carolina. From 1770 onward the
          Separate Baptists increased in Virginia from 1,335 in 1771 to
          3,195 in 1773. In 1774 it was determined by the General
          Association to restore the office of apostle, and Samuel Harris,
          the most successful of the Virginia evangelists, was appointed
          apostle for the southern district, and a little later John
          Waller and Elijah Craig became apostles for the northern
          district. In 1775 the question of general and particular
          redemption was debated in the General Association, and by a
          small majority particular redemption prevailed. The three
          apostles withdrew by way of protest and disruption seemed
          inevitable. But better counsels prevailed and mutual toleration
          was agreed upon. Arminian tendencies gradually disappeared and
          in 1783 the Philadelphia Confession was adopted with provision
          against its too strict construction.

    § 7. Baptists and Religious Liberty.

          Virginia Baptists were among the earliest and stanchest
          supporters of the Revolution and led in the struggle for
          religious equality. The General Association in 1776 appointed a
          committee on grievances, which zealously devoted itself to the
          abolition of dissenters' disabilities until the establishment
          itself was abolished, the glebe lands confiscated, and absolute
          separation of Church and State secured. Not content with being
          chiefly instrumental in securing religious equality in Virginia,
          Virginia Baptists watched closely the forming of the Federal
          Constitution and were instrumental in procuring the insertion of
          art. i, which prohibits Congress from taking any cognizance of
          religion. From 1883 onward Regular Baptists of Virginia joined
          hands with the Separates in the struggle for religious equality
          and the separation of Church and State and in 1787 the two
          parties united, agreeing to bury in oblivion the names Regular
          and Separate, and adopting the name "United Baptist Churches of
          Christ in Virginia." In New England the struggle for religious
          liberty on the part of the Baptists was no less heroic, but it
          was far less successful. In Virginia the Episcopal clergy were
          corrupt and oppressive and were bitterly opposed to the
          Revolution, and Baptists had the cooperation of leading
          statesmen, of the patriotic masses, and (in most measures) of
          the Presbyterians; while in New England the clergy and members
          of the standing order were leaders in the cause of Colonial
          independence and Baptists became unpopular by agitating their
          grievances and threatening to appeal to England for their
          redress at the very time when resistance to British authority
          was being determined upon. This difference of attitude of the
          Established Churches in the two sections accounts for the fact
          that the Baptists of Virginia not only led in the struggle for
          religious liberty but multiplied in numbers during the
          Revolution and after, while Massachusetts and Connecticut
          Baptists failed to secure religious liberty and made little
          progress during the Revolution. In 1812 there were in Virginia,
          North Carolina, South Carolina, Georgia, Kentucky, and Tennessee
          108,843 Baptist communicants, while those of Maine, New
          Hampshire, Massachusetts, Rhode Island, and Connecticut numbered
          32,372, and those of New York, New Jersey, Pennsylvania,
          Delaware, and Maryland, 26,852. In Virginia alone there were
          35,655 Baptist church members.

  3. From 1812 to the Present Time:

    § 1. Lack of an Educated Ministry.

          While Baptists had by the beginning of this period attained to a
          numerical strength of nearly 200,000, they were deficient in
          culture and had made almost no provision for an educated
          ministry. Brown University was still the only institution for
          higher education, and this provided no theological course. In
          Boston, Providence, Newport, New York, Philadelphia, and
          Charleston, and in a number of other churches in the
          Philadelphia, Warren, and Charleston Associations there was
          considerable culture. The Charleston Association had established
          (1791) an Education Fund, and by 1813 had aided nineteen young
          ministers in securing an education, some under private
          tutorship, some at Brown University, and some in other
          institutions. In 1812 the Baptist Education Society of the
          Middle States was constituted and Dr. William Staughton, of
          Philadelphia, began to instruct students for the ministry on its
          behalf. The vast majority of American Baptists at this time
          regarded ministerial education as an impertinent human effort to
          exercise the divine prerogative of calling and equipping
          ministers, and looked with disfavor upon the paying and
          receiving of ministerial salaries as introducing a commercial
          element where the Holy Spirit should work unimpeded. A large
          proportion of Baptist preachers owned their farms and were
          self-supporting. Many of them without scholastic advantages
          acquired considerable education and were men of power. The
          tendency was to neglect the towns, where the self-supporting
          method was impracticable and where enthusiastic but illiterate
          ministers were less acceptable. Some able ministers who could
          have afforded to minister in towns and cities resolutely refused
          to leave their country homes and work. Churches like those of
          Boston, New York, and Philadelphia found the utmost difficulty
          in supplying their pulpits when vacancies occurred. The only
          periodical publication in circulation at the time was the
          Massachusetts Baptist Missionary Magazine, the first number of
          which was published in 1803 and the twelfth in 1808. Under the
          editorship of Dr. Thomas Baldwin, of Boston, it exerted a strong
          but not very wide-spread influence in favor of missions,
          education, and better methods of denominational work. The Lake
          Baptist Missionary Society (afterward called the Hamilton
          Missionary Society) was formed in Central New York (1807) for
          domestic evangelization. From the beginning of the century (or
          earlier) Baptists of Boston, New York, Philadelphia, and
          Charleston joined with other denominations in contributing
          toward the support of the missionary work of Carey and his
          associates in India. In 1812 Philadelphia Baptists began to hold
          monthly union meetings and larger quarterly meetings "for the
          spread of the gospel."

    § 2. Missionary and Educational Work.

          The conversion to Baptist views of [901]Adoniram Judson and
          [902]Luther Rice, as they were about to open up missionary work
          in India under the auspices of the American Board of
          Commissioners for Foreign Missions, marks an era in the history
          of American Baptists. Judson announced his conversion to
          American Baptists through Thomas Baldwin, of Boston, and L.
          Bolles, of Salem, and threw himself and his missionary
          enterprise upon the liberality and enlightened zeal of the
          denomination. The more intelligent Baptist communities rejoiced
          that so glorious a responsibility had been providentially thrust
          upon the denomination and began at once to organize local
          missionary societies for the diffusion of the missionary spirit
          and the raising of funds. "The Baptist Society for Propagating
          the Gospel in India and other Foreign Parts" was formed at
          Boston in 1813 with Baldwin as president and Daniel Sharp as
          secretary. Rice returned to America (summer of 1813) for the
          purpose of arousing American Baptists to a sense of their
          obligation and opportunity. Through his efforts local missionary
          societies were formed from Maine to Georgia and considerable
          money was raised. In May, 1814, thirty-three leading brethren
          from eleven States met in Philadelphia and organized the
          "General Missionary Convention of the Baptist Denomination in
          the U. S. A. for Foreign Missions," to meet triennially. Richard
          Furman, of Charleston, was chosen president and Thomas Baldwin
          secretary. The Convention appointed a Board of Commissioners as
          an executive with Baldwin as president and Philadelphia (from
          1826 onward, Boston) as headquarters. William Staughton of
          Philadelphia was the first corresponding secretary. By 1817 Rice
          and other leaders had become convinced that provision for the
          education of ministers was absolutely essential to the progress
          of denominational work at home and abroad, and the Triennial
          Convention of 1817 approved of the raising of funds for this
          purpose. In 1818 a theological institution was opened in
          Philadelphia, with William Staughton and Irah Chase as
          instructors. As early as 1815 Rice had reached profound
          conviction regarding the necessity of missionary work in the
          newly settled regions of the West, and in 1817 the Triennial
          Convention decided to enter upon this work. Two zealous and well
          educated ministers, J. M. Peck and J. E. Welsh, were appointed
          home missionaries. The work of the former proved apostolic and
          was of momentous importance. From 1817 onward Rice labored with
          consuming zeal for the establishment in Washington of a National
          Baptist University. Columbian College was opened in 1822 and has
          done a noble work. The theological work inaugurated in
          Philadelphia was transferred to Washington in 1821. As a means
          of promoting the missionary and educational work Rice began
          (1816) the publication of The Latter Day Luminary and (1822) The
          Columbian Star.

    § 3. Opposition and Difficulties.

          By 1826 the college had become inextricably involved in debt.
          The situation became so desperate that the mission funds were
          drawn upon to meet pressing claims. From the beginning the great
          mass of the Baptists had shown themselves indifferent or hostile
          to the missionary and educational enterprises. It was easy for
          ignorant and illiberal pastors to persuade their still more
          ignorant and illiberal parishioners that the introduction of
          commercialism into religion was of the devil and that they were
          doing God service in resisting all efforts at exploitation on
          the part of the money gatherers. In many cases associations
          excluded churches, and churches members, for contributing to the
          funds of the enterprises fostered by the Triennial Convention.
          State Conventions were formed as bonds of union for those who
          were alive to the importance of united effort. Massachusetts
          Baptists had effected a State organization in 1802. South
          Carolina followed in the year 1821. In a few years nearly every
          State had organized a convention made up exclusively of
          cooperating churches, associations, and individuals. In the
          States of Ohio, Tennessee, and Kentucky, the missionary movement
          was well-nigh overwhelmed by the antieffort party. In Ohio,
          Baptists contributed for Foreign Missions in 1820, $547. From
          1821 to 1828 nothing was given, while $10 constituted the
          contribution in 1829 and $5 that of the following year. In
          Tennessee, missionary societies were dissolved and associations
          rescinded all resolutions favorable to the schemes of the
          Triennial Convention. Not till after 1840 could the cause of
          missions get a hearing. The most influential leader of the
          movement was Daniel Parker, an illiterate enthusiast, who held
          to an extreme type of supralapsarianism and wrought up his
          followers to a fanatical hatred of all organized effort. It was
          in the regions occupied by this perverse type of Baptists that
          [903]Alexander Campbell worked so successfully, combining, as he
          did, with his bitter denunciation of human institutions,
          vigorous antagonism to hyper-Calvinistic theology.

    § 4. Theological Seminaries.

          In 1825, owing in part to the financial difficulties of
          Columbian College, and the willingness of New England Baptists
          to provide for its support, the theological work was transferred
          to Newton Theological Institution at Newton Center, Mass., with
          Irah Chase as president. In 1819 the Baptists of New York laid
          the foundations for Colgate University at Hamilton, N. Y., with
          its literary and theological departments. In 1826, for reasons
          above suggested, the Triennial Convention left Columbian College
          to its own resources, retaining only the right to nominate fifty
          brethren from whom its Board should be chosen. The Baptists in
          the various States have been too much occupied in founding and
          building up local colleges to give adequate support to
          Columbian, and recently its Board have thought it best to
          declare it undenominational and to change its name to George
          Washington University. Ample provision has been made by the
          denomination for ministerial education by the establishment, in
          addition to the institutions already mentioned, of Rochester
          Theological Seminary (1850), at Rochester, N. Y., Southern
          Baptist Theological Seminary (1859, Louisville, Ky.), Divinity
          School of the University of Chicago (Baptist Union Theological
          Seminary, Morgan Park, Ill., 1867), Crozer Theological Seminary
          (1868, Upland, Penn.), Pacific Coast Baptist Theological
          Seminary (1890, Berkeley, Cal.), Baylor Theological Seminary
          (1901, connected with Baylor University, Waco, Tex.), Kansas
          City Theological Seminary (1901), and the Theological Department
          of Union University (1867, Richmond, Va.). These institutions
          have property and endowments aggregating about $7,000,000, over
          100 instructors, and over 1,200 students.

    § 5. Universities, Colleges and Schools.

          The denomination maintains about 100 universities and colleges
          of various grades with property and endowments aggregating about
          $45,000,000, nearly 2,000 instructors, and 30,000 students. The
          most important of these are the University of Chicago, Chicago,
          Ill. (founded 1891, with assets of $20,000,000); Brown
          University, Providence, R. I. (1764, $5,500.000); Colgate
          University, Hamilton, N. Y. (1819, $2,500,000); Bucknell
          University, Lewisburg, Penn. (1846, $1,700,000); Baylor
          University, Waco, Tex. (1845, $600,000); Colby College,
          Waterville, Me. (1818, $700,000); Denison University, Granville,
          O. (1831, $1,050,000); Stetson University, Deland, Fla. (1887,
          $600,000); Mercer University, Macon, Ga. (1838, $550,000);
          Richmond College, Richmond, Va. (1832, $1,065,000); Rochester
          University, Rochester, N. Y. (1850, $1,370,000); Wake Forest
          College, Wake Forest, N. C. (1834, $500,000); William Jewell
          College, Liberty, Mo. (1849, $550,000); Kalamazoo College,
          Kalamazoo, Mich. (1833, $431,000); Vassar College, Poughkeepsie,
          N. Y. (1861, $1,660,000). A score of other institutions with
          less ample resources are doing good work along chosen lines.
          There are more than 100 academic institutions under the auspices
          of the denomination, with nearly 20,000 students and nearly
          $5,000,000 worth of property.

    §6. The Home Mission Society.

          By 1832 the domestic missionary work of the Triennial Convention
          had reached such proportions that the need of a separate Board
          and a separate appeal for funds was apparent. At this time the
          American Baptist Home Mission Society was organized. The Society
          has always made New York City its headquarters. Its missionary
          work on the frontiers, among the Indians, negroes, and foreign
          populations, in Canada, Mexico, Cuba, and Porto Rico, employs at
          present over 1,500 missionaries and teachers. There are
          twenty-five schools and colleges for colored people supported by
          it wholly or in part. It has nearly $1,500,000 of permanent
          funds for various purposes, and mission and school properties
          valued at $1,300,000. Since its organization nearly 200,000
          persons have been baptized by its missionaries and nearly 6,000
          churches organized.

    § 7. The Publication Society.

          The demand for an agency for the publication and circulation of
          denominational and other religious literature led to the
          organization of the Baptist General Tract Society in 1824. Its
          head quarters were at Washington and it was under the general
          direction of Luther Rice. The complications that arose in
          connection with Columbian College and the superior publishing
          and distributing facilities offered by Philadelphia led to a
          change of location in 1826. In 1840 a revised constitution with
          the name American Baptist Publication Society was adopted. The
          society has formed an important factor in the growth of the
          denomination and it has kept abreast of its needs. The annual
          receipts of the publishing department at present amount to
          nearly $900,000 and in its missionary and Bible departments to
          about $200,000. Its net assets amount to about $1,600,000. The
          refusal of the American Bible Society to appropriate funds for
          the publication of a Burmese version in which the words for
          "baptize" and "baptism" were translated by words equivalent to
          "immerse" and "immersion" (see [904]Bible Societies, III, § 2)
          led to the organization of the American and Foreign Bible
          Society (1836). The refusal of this society to secure the
          publication of an English version in which "immersion" should
          supplant "baptism" led to the formation of the American Bible
          Union (1850), which employed Thomas J. Conant, H. B. Hackett,
          and others to prepare a new version of the Bible with critical
          apparatus and notes. The New Testament and portions of the Old
          were completed. Hostility between the American and Foreign Bible
          Society and the American Bible Union was crippling to both and
          in 1883 both were compelled by a great denominational gathering
          to relinquish the field, the Missionary Union assuming
          responsibility for the publication and circulation of the
          Scriptures in foreign languages in its fields and the
          Publication Society undertaking to complete and circulate the
          Bible Union and the Anglo-American Revised versions, as well as
          the King James version.

    § 8. The Southern Baptists.

          Before 1840 the slavery question was agitated in Baptist
          circles. Many Southern Baptists, including leading ministers,
          were slaveholders, and nearly all were very sensitive to
          Northern abolitionist utterances. In 1843 the neutrality of the
          Foreign Mission Board was reaffirmed. With a view to making
          continued cooperation practicable, Richard Fuller, an eminent
          Southern Baptist, offered a resolution in the Triennial
          Convention for 1844 for the elimination from the consideration
          of the body of all matters foreign to the object designated in
          the constitution and declaring cooperation in the proper work of
          the body not to involve or imply concert or sympathy as regards
          other matters. This resolution was withdrawn in favor of one
          whereby the body disclaimed all sanction of slavery or of
          antislavery and left each individual free in a Christian manner
          and spirit to express and promote his own views on these
          subjects. Notwithstanding the adoption of this resolution the
          Foreign Mission Board was thought to have procured the
          resignation of an Indian missionary who was a slaveholder.
          Southern Baptists were convinced that thenceforth slaveholders
          would be discriminated against and that future of the Convention
          would be rendered tumultuous by attacks on slavery and
          rejoinders. A literary controversy between Francis Wayland,
          President of Brown University, and Richard Fuller awakened much
          interest and demonstrated the impossibility of harmony between
          Northern and Southern Baptists. Conciliatory measures were
          attempted on both aides; but the conviction had become
          overmastering among Southern leaders that the Baptists of the
          South. could work more successfully with separate Convention and
          Boards. This policy was carried into effect in May, 1845, by 370
          messengers from the various Southern States. Home and Foreign
          Mission Boards were at once constituted, and both these
          departments of work have been vigorously prosecuted. The Foreign
          Mission Board (Richmond) has for years conducted successful
          missionary work in Italy, Brazil, Argentina, Mexico, Africa,
          China, and Japan, and has attained to an annual income of about
          $300,000. The total membership of native churches under the
          Board is reported (1905) as 11,423. The Home Mission Board
          (Atlanta) expends nearly $200,000 a year within the bounds of
          the Convention, in Cuba, and in the insular possessions of the
          United States. The Sunday-school Board (Nashville), besides
          furnishing Sunday-school papers and other requisites, publishes
          a number of books, and fosters Sunday-school work through a
          professorship in the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary and
          through district secretaries who labor throughout its
          constituency. Its annual receipts are about $125,000. The
          Southern Baptist Theological Seminary is cherished by the
          Convention, which nominates brethren from whom the members of
          its Board are chosen and receives its annual report.

          After the formation of the Southern Baptist Convention, the
          Foreign Mission Board of the Triennial Convention became the
          American Baptist Missionary Union, which has since had annual
          meetings in connection with the American Baptist Publication
          Society, the American Baptist Home Mission Society, etc. Women's
          auxiliary societies cooperate with the Northern and Southern
          Boards.

    § 9. The Baptist Congress and Young People's Union.

          The Baptist Congress is not strictly a denominational
          organization; but is supported by subscribing members and holds
          an annual meeting for the free discussion of current questions
          of doctrine, polity, and life. Its annual reports furnish the
          public with the most advanced thought. The Baptist Young
          People's Union of America (1891 onward) seeks to promote
          Christian activity, intelligence, and denominational spirit
          among the Baptist young people of the United States and Canada.

    § 10. Colored Baptists

          Baptist owners of slaves were by no means indifferent to their
          spiritual welfare. It is estimated that there were 400,000 negro
          Baptists in the United States at the close of the Civil War.
          Most of these were members of the churches of their masters; but
          in the towns and cities many negro churches had been
          constituted. The first of these on record is that in Savannah,
          Ga. (1788) of which Andrew Bryan was for many years pastor. The
          largest negro Baptist church before emancipation was that in
          Richmond, Va., of which for twenty-five years Robert Ryland,
          president of Richmond College, was pastor. In many churches
          controlled by the whites a majority were negroes. After
          emancipation they everywhere effected separate church
          organization. Associations were almost immediately formed, State
          Conventions soon followed, and in 1880 a National Convention was
          organized with its Home Mission, Foreign Mission, Education,
          Publishing, and Baptist Young People's Union Boards. Besides the
          University, Theological Seminary, and Colleges founded and
          fostered by the American Baptist Home Mission Society, they have
          established, own, and control scores of institutions of higher
          and lower grades. Over 15,000 students are in attendance at
          these schools. While hundreds of their ministers have enjoyed
          educational advantages and are in a position to elevate those
          under their ministry, thousands are illiterate and incapable of
          wise leadership. Since emancipation they have increased in
          number fivefold, the present membership, according to the
          statistician of the National Baptist Convention (1905) being
          2,189,000.

    § 11. German Baptists

          The first to gather German Baptist churches in America was
          Conrad Fleischmann, a Swiss, who in 1841 organized three
          churches in Pennsylvania. By 1851 there were eight small
          churches with 405 members. The present membership is about
          25,000. They have seven annual Conferences and a triennial
          General Conference. Their publishing house is located in
          Cleveland and their training-school for ministers is organically
          connected with the Rochester Theological Seminary. Educational
          and missionary work among the Germans of the United States and
          Canada has been from the first generously assisted by American
          Baptists.

    § 12. Scandinavian Baptists.

          The first Scandinavian Baptist church in America was formed in
          Illinois in 1848. At present there are about 5,000
          Dano-Norwegian Baptists with eighty-six churches, whose
          representatives meet annually in seven Conferences. Their
          ministers are educated in the Dano-Norwegian Department of the
          Divinity School of the University of Chicago. Swedish Baptists
          (first church organized 1853) are far more numerous, having at
          present over 300 churches and nearly 25,000 members. The
          education of their ministers is provided for in the Divinity
          School of the University of Chicago. Scandinavian Baptists are
          most numerous in Wisconsin, Illinois, Minnesota, Dakota, Iowa,
          and Nebraska.

  4. Minor Baptist Parties in the United States:

          (a) The Six-Principles Baptists are a survival of the General
          Baptists that prevailed in Rhode Island and Connecticut in the
          early time. They still contend for the laying-on of hands as an
          indispensable ordinance. They have at present less than a score
          of churches with less than a thousand members.

          (b) The first Seventh-Day Baptist church was organized at
          Newport, R. I., in 1671. As the name indicates, they make the
          celebration of the Jewish Sabbath as the day of rest and worship
          rather than the Lord's Day an essential, and devote much of
          their attention to showing the error of adopting another day and
          the evil consequences that flow from this perversion. They have
          institutions of learning at Milton, Wis., and Alfred Center, N.
          Y., and circulate considerable literature through their
          publishing house at the latter place. They have ninety-seven
          churches with a membership of less than 9,000, acattered over
          twenty-four States. For the so-called Seventh-Day Baptists,
          German, see [905]Communism, II, 5.

          (c) The Free-Will Baptists originated in New Hampshire in 1780
          under the leadership of Benjamin Randall who left the
          Congregationalist body to become an anti-Calvinistic and open
          communion Baptist. The Arminian teaching was no doubt due to
          Methodist influence. Free-Will Baptists took an active part in
          the antislavery agitation (1835 onward) and thus closed the
          South against their influence. They were reenforced in 1841 by
          2,500) free-Communion Baptists of New York State; but the
          Adventist movement a little later deprived them of a large
          number. From 1845 to 1857 their numbers declined from 60,000 to
          49,000, but by 1870 they regained this loss. They have lost
          about 1,500 members since 1890; the present membership (1905) is
          86,322. They have 1,543 churches distributed over thirty-three
          States. They early adopted quarterly and annual conferences, the
          former made up of delegates of churches, the latter of delegates
          from the former. The system is overtopped by the General
          Conference composed of delegates from the local annual
          conferences. The quarterly meeting may discipline churches, the
          annual meeting quarterly meetings, and the General Conference
          annual meetings. Ministers are first licensed by the quarterly
          meeting and after probation are ordained by the council
          appointed by the same body. Women are eligible for ordination to
          the ministry. Negotiations looking to the union of the Free-Will
          Baptists with the Regular Baptists of the North are pending with
          good prospects of success.

          (d) It has been noted that the General Baptists from Virginia
          first introduced Baptist teaching into North Carolina. Some of
          the churches formed under this influence refused to amalgamate
          with the Separate and Regular Baptists. After a time they
          adopted the name Original Free-Will Baptists to distinguish
          themselves from the more numerous body mentioned above. They
          differ from the Free-Will Baptists in practising foot-washing,
          anointing the sick with oil, restricting the ministerial office
          to men, and having ruling elders for the settlement of
          controversies. Annual conferences may silence unworthy
          preachers, disown elders, and settle church difficulties. They
          have three Conferences, 167 churches, and less than 12,000
          members, all in North Carolina and South Carolina.

          (e) A number of General Baptist churches of the older English
          type failed to amalgamate with the more popular Baptist parties
          of the nineteenth century. The first association of this party
          was formed in Kentucky in 1824. This association adopted open
          communion in 1830. A General Association was formed in 1870 to
          embrace all the churches of the connection. Unlike most of the
          smaller Baptist bodies, this had increased from 8,000 members in
          1870 to 21,362 in 1890. More recent statistics are not
          available. Their confession of faith indicates closer agreement
          with Regular Baptists in doctrine and in practise than does that
          of the Free-Will Baptists. They have about 400 churches in
          Missouri, Indiana, Kentucky, Illinois, Arkansas, Tennessee, and
          Nebraska.

          (f) A few churches in Indiana have retained the name Separate
          Baptists. They are in general agreement with Free-Will Baptists.
          They seem to be confined to Indiana, where they have an
          association with 24 churches and about 1,600 members.

          (g) In the union of Regular and Separate Baptists in Kentucky in
          1801 a doctrinal basis not strictly Calvinistic was adopted.
          About 200 churches in Kentucky, Tennessee, Missouri, Alabama,
          and Arkansas, with a membership of over 13,000, still call
          themselves United Baptists and hold aloof from the great Baptist
          body. They are moderately Calvinistic, practise restricted
          communion, and insist upon foot-washing as an ordinance to be
          practised by all baptized believers. They have several
          associations.

          (h) Mention has already been made of the bitter opposition that
          arose in many Baptist communities to the missionary and
          educational enterprises that centered in the Triennial
          Convention (1814 onward). The Chemung Association (N. Y. and
          Penn.) seems to have been the first (1835) to disfellowship
          other associations that had departed from the simplicity of the
          doctrine and practise of the gospel by "uniting themselves with
          the world and what are falsely called benevolent societies
          founded upon a monied basis." This example was speedily followed
          by many other associations, especially in the South and
          Southwest. Besides holding to extreme necessitarian
          (supralapsarian) doctrine in accordance with which human agency
          in the conversion of men is absolutely ineffective and the
          attempt to employ it impertinent, they practise foot-washing as
          an ordinance and utterly repudiate missionary, Bible, tract,
          Sunday-school, and temperance societies, State conventions,
          theological schools, and similar organizations. The United
          States census of 1890 brought to light 121,347 Baptist
          communicants of this type, with churches in twenty-eight States
          and the District of Columbia. They are most numerous in Georgia,
          Alabama, Tennessee, North Carolina, Kentucky, and Virginia, but
          are found all the way from Maine to Texas and from Nebraska to
          Florida. They call themselves Primitive Baptists; they are
          commonly called "Hardshells" and Anti-Mission Baptists by their
          opponents.

          (i) The followers of Daniel Parker, the most virulent opponent
          of the organized work of the denomination (b. in Georgia,
          ordained in Tennessee in 1806, active in Illinois 1817-36, and
          in Texas after 1836), are known as the Old
          Two-Seed-in-the-Spirit Predestinarian Baptists. They still
          persist in twenty-four States and had in 1890 nearly 500
          churches with nearly 13,000 members. They derive their name from
          the peculiar doctrine of Parker set forth in certain pamphlets
          (1826-29) on the doctrine of Two Seeds. This was a fantastic
          dualistic account of the introduction and perpetuation of evil
          in mankind, reminding of Gnostic speculations. God created Adam
          and Eve and infused into them particles of himself so that they
          were wholly good. The devil corrupted them by infusing particles
          of himself. It was predetermined by God that Eve should bring
          forth a certain number of good offspring, the seed of God, and
          that her daughters should do likewise. The evil essence infused
          by the serpent led to an additional brood of offspring, the seed
          of Satan or the serpent. For the former the Atonement was
          absolute, they will all be saved. The Atonement did not apply to
          the seed of the serpent, who are hopelessly lost. The doctrine
          of Parker was absolutely fatalistic and was in the worst sense
          antinomian. His followers go beyond the other Primitive Baptists
          in their uncompromising hostility to "human institutions."

          (k) The Baptist Church of Christ came into separate existence by
          way of reaction against the antinomian hyper-Calvinism of the
          churches led by Daniel Parker. They teach general redemption
          along with perseverance of the saints. Like most of the minor
          Baptist parties they practise footwashing as an ordinance. This,
          more than anything else, prevents their union with the great
          Baptist body; but, like the Primitive Baptists, they seem to
          object to organized denominational missionary and educational
          work. The chief strength of the body is in Tennessee, but
          congregations are found in Arkansas, Alabama, Mississippi,
          Missouri, North Carolina, and Texas. In 1890 the party had 152
          churches with a total membership of 8,254.

          The [906]Dunkers have much in common with Primitive Baptists,
          and, with the Church of God founded in Pennsylvania in 1830 by
          John Winebrenner (see [907]Church of God, 1), are more worthy to
          be classed with Baptists than some of the above parties. The
          [908]River Brethren and the Mennonite body known as the
          Brüder-Gemeinde (see [909]Mennonites) have much in common with
          Baptists. The [910]Disciples of Christ, originally an offshoot
          from the Baptists, agree with the latter in insisting upon
          immersion as the only valid baptism and in their recognition of
          the sole authority of the Scriptures in matters of faith and
          practise. They differ from Baptists in a number of important
          matters, but there is more in common between progressive
          Disciples and the great Baptist body than there is between the
          latter and several of the minor parties that bear the Baptist
          name. The body who call themselves "Christians," frequently
          known as the Christian Connection (see [911]Christians) also
          regard immersion of believers as the only true baptism. They
          practise open communion and admit to membership those who do not
          agree with them respecting immersion. In England they would pass
          for satisfactory Baptists.

III. Baptists in the British Possessions.

  1. The Dominion of Canada:

    § 1. The Maritime Provinces.

          The Maritime Provinces were the first to receive Baptist
          influence. In 1752 a Dutch Baptist named Andres is said to have
          settled in Lunenburg and to have disseminated his principles
          there. In 1763 Ebenezer Moulton of Massachusetts organized a
          church at Horton, N. S., of Baptists and Congregationalists,
          which soon became wholly Baptist. Just before, during, and after
          the Revolutionary War, a considerable number of New England
          Baptist loyalists found their way to Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
          and Prince Edward Island. In 1880 an association was formed
          which adopted the English Particular Baptist Confession of 1689.
          In 1846 the Baptist Convention of Nova Scotia, New Brunswick,
          and Prince Edward Island was formed with a constituency of
          14,177. Acadia University (chartered 1840, successor to Horton
          Academy, 1828) at Wolfville, N. S., was adopted by the
          Convention and has educated a large number of leaders not only
          for the Maritime Provinces, but for Western Canada and the
          United States. It now has endowment and equipment worth about
          $500,000. The Convention has its domestic and foreign mission
          boards and has engaged zealously and successfully in every line
          of denominational work. About 17,000 Free-Will Baptists have
          united with the Regulars on the basis of a brief doctrinal
          statement that avoids strict Calvinistic phraseology and
          insistence on restricted communion. The Maritime Baptists number
          at present about 67,000.

    § 2. Ontario and Quebec.

          Baptist loyalists in small numbers during the later years of the
          eighteenth century found their way into what is now Ontario and
          Quebec, and by the beginning of the nineteenth century about six
          small churches had been organized in three widely separated
          localities. These were fostered by missionary effort from the
          United States and reenforced by further immigration of their
          fellow countrymen. Later a considerable number of English
          Baptists of open communion antecedents came in and were the
          occasion of discord. In 1816 a company of Scotch Highlanders,
          who had become Baptists in connection with the Haldane movement,
          settled in the Ottawa region. Most of these became advocates of
          restricted communion; but several of the most eminent (notably
          John Gilmour) favored open communion. A society was formed in
          England (1836) for fostering Baptist work in Canada. The Upper
          Canada Missionary Society refused to cooperate fully with the
          educational and missionary work that centered in Montreal and
          was conducted under English open communion auspices. The Canada
          Baptist College established in Montreal in 1838 died of
          inanition in 1849, although it had at its head such scholars as
          Benjamin Davis and J. M. Cramp. Dissension prevented the success
          of further efforts to provide the denomination with educational
          facilities until 1860, when the Canadian Literary and
          Theological Institute was opened at Woodstock with R. A. Fyfe as
          Principal. Fyfe proved a leader of the first rank and exerted a
          strong unifying influence upon the denomination. By this time
          the denomination in Ontario and Quebec had a membership of about
          13,000. After cooperating with the American Baptist Missionary
          Union in foreign mission work for a number of years, the
          Baptists of Ontario and Quebec organized an independent Foreign
          Mission Society, whose work has steadily grown until at present
          $40,000 are expended annually on its missions in India and
          Bolivia. In 1881 Toronto Baptist College was founded as a
          theological seminary by Senator William McMaster. This
          institution developed into McMaster University as a result of
          the bequest of nearly $1,000,000 by the founder. In 1888 the
          organization of the denomination was completed in a new
          constitution and charter, which commits to the Convention made
          up exclusively of delegates of churches the election of Home
          Mission, Foreign Mission, Publication, and Education Boards.
          Baptists in Ontario and Quebec now number about 47,000.

    § 3. The Northwest and British Columbia.

          Baptist work in the Canadian Northwest began about 1873. It has
          grown to large proportions and has enjoyed the support of
          Baptists in the older Provinces, in Great Britain, and in the
          United States. A Convention was organized in 1881, and Brandon
          College, at Brandon, Man., was established in 1899. The college
          already has equipment and endowment worth about $150,000. The
          Baptist cause in British Columbia has not yet attained to very
          large dimensions. During the earlier years Baptist churches in
          this region worked in connection with the American Baptist Home
          Mission Society. In 1897 they formed a Convention of their own
          and since that time they have depended for help chiefly upon the
          Baptists of the older Provinces. Baptists in Manitoba and the
          Northwest Territories now number about 7,000; in British
          Columbia, 2,000.

  2. Australia, Tasmania, and New Zealand:

          In these colonies Baptists were among the earliest British
          settlers, and Baptist churches were organized from 1834 onward.
          The several British types of Baptist life have been represented
          and some controversy has had place regarding communion,
          Calvinism and Arminianism, etc.; but the ordinary English open
          communion type has prevailed. There are still about a dozen
          churches of the old Particular Baptist antimissionary type. Most
          of the churches of the various provinces are grouped in seven
          Unions, which correspond with each other and support in common a
          religious journal. The Baptist College of Victoria in
          affiliation with the University of Melbourne was conducted from
          1890 to 1900 and then abandoned. Some Foreign Mission work is
          being accomplished in India in connection with the English
          Baptist Society. There are at present in Australasia sixty-eight
          churches and about 21,000 members. Progress for the past few
          years has been very slow.

  3. The British West Indies, Central America, and Africa:

          English Baptists commenced missionary work among the negroes of
          Jamaica in the year 1814. The way had been prepared somewhat by
          Moses Baker, an American negro Baptist. In fifteen years there
          were 10,000 Baptists on the island. A negro insurrection in 1831
          led to the destruction of much of their church property and to
          the persecution of the leaders; but sympathy was awakened in
          Britain and the losses were made good. The work was extended to
          the Bahamas, Trinidad, Honduras, San Domingo, etc. The Jamaica
          Baptists have at present nearly 200 churches and nearly 34,000
          members; in Haiti there are 12 churches with nearly 2,000
          members; in Cuba (through American Baptist effort) there are 31
          churches with nearly 4,000 members; in the Bahamas nearly 4,000
          members; and in Central America 10 churches with nearly 700
          members. In Africa, through American, English, and German
          missionary effort there are 81 Baptist churches with 11,388
          members, mostly in British territory, the Kongo, and the
          Kamerun.

  4. India, Ceylon, Burma, and Assam:

          In these British possessions, through English, American, and
          Canadian missionary effort 1,244 churches have been organized
          with a membership of over 126,000. A very large proportion of
          the converts have been won by missionaries from the United
          States and Canada.

IV. Baptists in Mission Lands:

          In China there are about 13,000 Baptist church members almost
          equally divided among the English, Northern, and Southern
          Baptist missions. In Japan there are about 2,500 Baptist church
          members of whom over 2,000 belong to the American Baptist
          Missionary Union and the rest to the missions of the Southern
          Baptist Convention. In Mexico missions of the Southern Baptist
          Convention have nearly 1,400 church members to their credit,
          while those of the American Baptist Home Mission Society, with
          twenty-six laborers, have a far smaller number. In Brazil the
          missions of the Southern Baptist Convention have established
          sixty-nine churches with a membership of over 4,000, and in
          Bolivia Canadian Baptist missionaries have organized three
          churches with 115 members.

V. Baptists on the Continent of Europe.

  I. Germany and German Missions:

          The first Baptist church of the modern type organized in Germany
          was formed in Hamburg in 1834 under the leadership of [912]J. G.
          Oncken, who several years before had reached Baptist views from
          independent study of the New Testament. In his youth Oncken had
          spent some years in England and had been sent (1823) by an
          English evangelical society as a missionary to Germany. Oncken
          and six others availed themselves of the presence of Barnas
          Sears, of the United States, afterward famous as an educational
          leader, to receive baptism at his hands. Oncken proved a leader
          of heroic type and with the aid of American Baptists carried on
          for many years wide-spread and fruitful missionary labors and
          raised up like-minded ministers who are still carrying forward
          the work throughout German-speaking Europe and beyond. In 1880 a
          theological seminary was established near Hamburg that has given
          educational equipment to hundreds of earnest and
          self-sacrificing young men. The present membership in Germany is
          about 34,000. They sustain a mission in the Kamerun with over
          2,000 converts. The German Baptist Union for the spread of the
          gospel in foreign parts include churches in Austria (648
          members), Hungary (10,500 members), Switzerland (796 members),
          the Netherlands (1,396 members), Rumania (277 members), and
          Bulgaria (74 members). The Russian Baptist churches, which have
          resulted chiefly from the activity of German Baptists of the
          Oncken type, have now a membership of about 25,000 and a Union
          of their own; but they still cooperate with the German Union in
          the raising and use of missionary funds. Through the missionary
          labors of German Baptists a few Lithuanians were brought into
          the Baptist fold (1857 onward). A more successful work was done
          among the Letts, and about 7,000 of the Russian Baptists are
          Lettish. From the same source Baptist influence was brought to
          bear upon the Esthonians, of whom over 1,000 are now Baptist
          church members. The Finns received Baptist teaching from the
          Swedish Baptists (1868 onward) and now have over 2,000 Baptist
          church members.

  2. Scandinavia:

          From Germany Baptist influence also extended into Scandinavian
          lands. Julius Koebner, one of Oncken's early converts and
          co-laborers, was a Dane and on a visit to his native land won to
          his faith a company of Christians that had become dissatisfied
          with Lutheranism. The first church was organized in Copenhagen
          in 1839. Persecution impeded the progress of the Baptist cause
          and religious freedom was not gained until 1850. A considerable
          number of ministers trained in the Scandinavian Department of
          the Divinity School of the University of Chicago have assisted
          in carrying forward the work in Denmark as well as in Sweden and
          Norway. In 1895 the Danish Baptists established a small
          theological school of their own. They have not made rapid
          progress and their present membership is only about 4,000.
          German Baptist influence entered Norway not later than 1840. The
          first church was organized two years later. At present Norwegian
          Baptists have over 30 churches with a membership of about 3,000.
          A Danish Baptist named Foerster labored in Sweden in 1848 and
          baptized five persons near Gothenburg. The Baptist cause has
          greatly prospered here, so that at present there are 40,000
          members and nearly 600 churches. Since 1866 they have had a
          theological seminary at Stockholm. They are thoroughly organized
          for missionary and educational work and have reached a degree of
          influence and recognition enjoyed by Baptists nowhere else on
          the Continent of Europe.

  3. France and Italy:

          In France, Belgium, and French Switzerland there are about 40
          churches with a membership of 2,272, due in large measure to
          English Baptist missionary enterprise. In Italy there are 55
          churches and about 1,500 members, the result, in almost equal
          measure, of the missionary endeavors of the English Baptist
          Missionary Society and of the Southern Baptist Convention. The
          latter body sustains a theological college.

          Two highly significant events, indicating the desire of Baptists
          everywhere to draw closer together and to cooperate in the
          world-wide dissemination of their principles, were the formation
          of the General Baptist Convention (St. Louis, may, 1905) to
          embrace the entire continent of North America and its islands
          and to hold triennial meetings, and the Baptist World Congress
          (London, July, 1905), in which Baptists from all parts of the
          world gathered and organized a Baptist World Alliance, to meet
          every five years in different parts of the world. The union of
          the Free Baptists in the Maritime Provinces of Canada and the
          Regulars (1905) and the steps taken toward union between the
          Free Baptists of New England and the Regulars in the same year
          show that the tendency is in the direction of union rather than
          of further division.

          Counting all nominally Baptist bodies through out the world, the
          present number of Baptists is about 6,000,000. If to these other
          bodies of antipedobaptist immersionists be added, the number is
          increased to about 7,500,000.

   Barbara, Saint
          BARBARA, SAINT: A saint whose career belongs to the domain of
          legend; her name is not found in the Martyrologium Hieronymianum
          or in Bede. According to the traditional story, she was a maiden
          of great beauty, who, having been early converted to
          Christianity, was given up by her own father to the authorities,
          and beheaded by the præses of the province, Martinianus,
          steadfastly refusing to deny Christ. Her father is said to have
          been killed by lightning at the scene of the execution, which is
          stated to have been Nicomedia (in Bithynia), Tuscia (i.e.,
          Etruria), and Heliopolis in Egypt; the time was either under
          Maximinus (235-238) or sixty or seventy years later under
          Maximianus or Galerius. In Roman Catholic countries she is
          popularly considered to give protection against fire and
          tempest, and she is also the patron saint of the artillery. She
          is invoked by the dying in consequence of the story of Henry
          Kock at Gorkum, in Holland, in 1448, who, being nearly burnt to
          death, called on her and was preserved alive long enough to
          receive the last sacraments. Her feast falls on Dec. 4.

   Barbauld, Anna Letitia
          BARBAULD, ANNA LETITIA: Poetess; b. at Kibworth (10 m. s.e. of
          Leicester), Leicestershire, June 20, 1743; d. at Stoke Newington
          (a suburb of London) Mar. 9, 1825. She was the daughter of the
          Rev. John Aikin, a Presbyterian minister and school-teacher, and
          was carefully educated by her father; married the Rev. Rochemont
          Barbauld (d. 1808), a Unitarian minister, in May, 1774; with her
          husband she conducted a very successful school at Palgrave,
          Suffolk, till 1785; thereafter lived at Hampstead and Stoke
          Newington. At the solicitation of her brother (Dr. John Aikin)
          she published her first volume of Poems in 1773 and four
          editions were sold within a year. In the same year appeared
          Miscellaneous Pieces in Prose by J[ohn] and A. L. Aikin; in 1775
          Hymns in Prose for Children and Early Lessons for Children
          (written for her pupils), and Devotional Pieces Compiled from
          the Psalms of David. Her later writings are of a general and
          critical character and include political pamphlets, an edition
          of Collins (1797), of Akenside (1808), the British Novelists (50
          vols., 1810), with essay and biographical and critical notices,
          etc. Perhaps her best-known hymns are "Come, says Jesus's sacred
          voice," "How blest the righteous when he dies," and "Awake, my
          soul, lift up thine eyes."

          Eight years later he returned to England, and until 1896 was a
          preacher in the Leeds (Brunswick) Circuit. In 1896 he was
          appointed general secretary of the Wesleyan Missionary Society,
          but two years later was chosen headmaster of the Leys School,
          Cambridge, where he had already been assistant master in
          1877-80. He was secretary of the General Missionary Conference,
          Shanghai, 1890, and since 1902 has been a member of the Legal

          that games of chance are not immoral, and a Traité de la morale
          des Pères de l'Église (1728). He was a moderate Calvinist, and
          refused to sign the Helvetic Formula Concensus, which
          disapproved of the doctrines of Amyraut and the other Saumur
          theologians.

   Barckhausen-Volkmann Controversy
          BARCKHAUSEN-VOLKMANN CONTROVERSY: A discussion of the question
          of predestination and grace which was carried on with much ardor
          in Germany early in the eighteenth century. In the Reformed
          Church of Brandenburg particularly many things tended to start
          troublesome questions on these points. The Confessio Sigismundi
          of 1614 had followed the Augsburg Confession with "revision and
          improvements," whereby it became not merely universalistic, but
          synergistic, and, in its exposition of predestination,
          approximated to the "Reformed Evangelical Churches." As a matter
          of fact it taught both the absolute election of every believer
          and universal grace. The need of making concessions to the
          Lutherans led to some modifications, as in the Colloquium
          Lipsiense of 1631, the Declaratio Thoruniensis of 1645 (see
          [915]Leipsic, Colloquy of; [916]Thorn, Conference of), and an
          edict of the Great Elector in 1664 (in C. O. Mylius, Corpus
          constitutionum Marchicarum, i, Berlin, 1737, 382 sqq.). The
          Brandenburg Church was thus separated from orthodox Calvinism,
          while still adhering to the Reformed type, and this the more as
          a large number of French congregations bound to Calvin's
          Confessio Gallicana were settled in the country.

          The Barckhausen-Volkmann controversy began with the publication
          (Cologne, 1712) of the Theses theologicæ of Paul Volkmann,
          rector of the Joachimsthal gymnasium at Berlin; it was a
          complete presentation of the Reformed dogmatics, maintaining
          universal grace and conditional election. Konrad Heinrich
          Barckhausen, a native of Detmold and colleague of Volkmann in
          Berlin (in 1715 rector of the Friedrich Werder gymnasium), came
          forward as protagonist against Volkmann's views. Under the
          pseudonym Pacificus Verinus he published in 1712 an Amica
          collatio doctrinæ de gratia and followed it the next year with a
          coarse German writing Mauritii Neodorpii Calvinus orthodoxus, d.
          i. sin kurzes Gespräch . . . worin bescheiden untersucht wird ob
          und wie weit die Lehre der Universalisten mit der Lehre der
          ersten reformirten Lehrer . . übereinkommen. A Berlin preacher,
          Stercki by name, took up the discussion on Volkmann's side and
          [917]Philippe Naudé), replied. The controversy was growing
          hotter when the Prussian king, Frederick William I, in 1719
          issued an edict commanding both sides to keep silence (Mylius,
          ut sup., 534-535).

          London), Surrey, 1552. He is believed to have studied at one, or
          perhaps both, of the English universities; traveled on the
          continent; was made chaplain in the collegiate church at Ottery
          St. Mary, Devonshire; afterward became a monk in the Benedictine
          monastery of Ely; in 1546 became vicar of Great Baddow, Essex,
          and of Wokey, Somersetshire; in 1552 also rector of All Saints
          in Lombard Street, London. His chief works were the Ship of
          Fools (London, 1509), a translation, with some additions, of
          Sebastian Brandt's Narrenschiff; and the Eclogues (n.d.,
          probably 1514).

   Barclay, John
          BARCLAY, JOHN: Minister of the Church of Scotland and founder of

          Edinburgh), Perthshire, 1734; d. at Edinburgh July 29, 1798. He
          was graduated M.A. at St. Andrews; was assistant minister at
          Errol, Perthshire, 1759-63, being dismissed in the latter year
          for teaching obnoxious doctrine; assistant at Fettercairn,
          Kincardineshire, 1763-72, where he was popular and admired, but
          continued to promulgate views inacceptable to the ministers. In
          1773 the General Assembly sustained his presbytery (Fordoun),
          which had inhibited him from preaching. His followers then
          formed independent congregations at Edinburgh and Fettercairn,
          and Barclay became minister of the former. He also preached and
          founded a society in London. His adherents took the name
          Beroeans (from Acts xvii, 11), professing to build their system
          of faith and practise upon the Scriptures alone, without regard
          to any human authority whatever. They denied natural religion,
          maintaining that knowledge of God is from revelation alone;
          considered faith in Christ and assurance of salvation as
          inseparable and the same; held that the sin against the Holy
          Ghost is unbelief; and interpreted a great part of the Old
          Testament prophecies and the whole of the Psalms as typical of
          Christ and not applicable to the experiences of private
          Christians. In other respects their views were those of ordinary
          Calvinism. They originally had several churches in Scotland and
          a few in America. Eadie (Ecclesiastical Cyclopedia, London,
          1862) characterizes them as "a small and diminishing party of
          religionists."

          near Strabane (15 m. s. by w. of Londonderry), County Tyrone,
          Ireland, Aug. 21, 1831; d. at Jerusalem Oct. 23, 1881. He
          studied at Trinity College, Dublin (B.A., 1854; M.A., 1857); was
          ordained curate at Bagnalstown, County Carlow, Ireland, 1854;
          becoming interested in the work of the London Society for
          Promoting Christianity among the Jews, he offered himself as a
          missionary in 1858, and was sent to Constantinople; was
          incumbent of Christ Church, Jerusalem 1861-70; curate of Howe,
          Lincolnshire, 1871, of St. Margaret's, Westminster, 1871-73; was
          consecrated bishop of Jerusalem July 25, 1879, and took up his
          residence in the city the following January. He preached in
          Spanish, French, and German, was a good Hebrew scholar, and
          acquainted with Turkish and Arabic. He published The Talmud, a
          translation of select treatises of the Mishnah, with
          introduction and notes (London, 1878), a work which has been
          generally criticized by Jewish scholars as prejudiced.

          Bibliography: A critical biography was published anonymously at
          London, 1883, giving extracts from his journals and letters; cf.

   Barclay, Robert
          BARCLAY, ROBERT: Scotch Quaker; b. at Gordonstown (28 m. n.w. of
          Aberdeen) Dec. 23, 1648; d. at Ury (14 m. s.w. of Aberdeen) Oct.
          3, 1690. He was descended from an ancient Scottish family and
          his father was Col. David Barclay of war celebrity in Germany
          and Sweden. After a careful home training he was sent to his
          uncle, Robert Barclay, rector of the Scotch College in Paris,
          for further education, and so came under Roman Catholic
          influences and inclined toward that communion. But in 1664 he
          was called home and in 1667 followed his father into the Society
          of Friends. He was zealous with voice and pen in the advocacy of
          their faith and in consequence was in prison for five months
          during 1676-77, and was again under arrest in 1679. If he had
          not had aristocratic and influential friends it might have gone
          much worse with him. He traveled through Great Britain and also
          in Holland and Germany. He was the most remarkable theologian
          the Quakers have produced. Besides a Catechism and Confession of
          Faith (1673; repeatedly reissued; translated into Latin, French,
          Danish, and Dutch), he prepared controversial works. The
          treatise upon which his great fame rests is An Apology for the
          true Christian divinity, as the same is held forth, and preached
          by the people, called, in scorn, Quakers. He had previously
          published fifteen theological theses for a debate and they were
          so favorably received that he translated them into Latin and
          accompanied them with an exposition in the same language,
          prefaced them with a remarkably faithful epistle to Charles II,
          dated Nov. 25, 1675, and issued the volume at Amsterdam in 1676.
          He says that he did this "for the information of strangers." In
          1678 he published, probably in Aberdeen, his own translation of
          the Apology, and it has become a classic. An edition, the
          fourteenth, was published at Glasgow in 1886, and other editions
          have appeared in Philadelphia; there are translations of it in
          German, French, Dutch, Spanish, and Danish. In 1692 William Penn
          brought out an edition of it, with other works, under the title
          Truth Triumphant through the spiritual warfare, Christian
          labours and writings of that able and faithful servant of Jesus
          Christ, Robert Barclay.

          München-Gladbach (16 m. w. of Düsseldorf) Mar. 16, 1851. He was
          educated at the universities of Bonn (Ph.D., 1873) and Würzburg,
          and in 1879 became privat-docent of theology at the University
          of Munich. In 1884 he accepted a call to Münster as professor of

          later returned in the same capacity to Munich, where he still
          remains. He has been a member of the Deutsche morgenländische

   Bardesanes
          BARDESANES, ??r´´de-sê´nîz (BAR-DAISAN): Gnostic; b. of Persian
          parents (Nuhama and Nasiram; cf. Chron. Edess., ed. L. Hallier,
          TU, ix, 1, Leipsic, 1892, 90; Michael Syrus), at Edessa, on the
          Daisan, on the 11th day of Tammuz (July), 154; d. there 222
          (Moses of Chorene, Hist. Armen., ii, 63; Michael Syrus). He was
          educated with the princes at the court (Epiphanius, Hær., lvi,
          1) and won distinction as well by his bodily excellences as for
          versatility of mind and the linguistic and scientific knowledge
          which he acquired. With his parents he went to Mabug
          (Hieropolis), where he became acquainted with Kuduz, a priest of
          the Dea Syra, who adopted him and taught him the doctrines of
          his cult. When twenty-five years of age, the priest sent him to
          Edessa, where he heard the preaching of the Christian bishop
          Hystaspes, was instructed by him, and baptized. He soon
          interested the Abgar of Edessa (Bar-Manu, c. 179-216) in the new
          religion. When Caracalla took Edessa (216-217), Bardesanes fled
          into Armenia, where he spent his time in writing and preaching,
          but returned afterward to Edessa.

          Of his writings, Eusebius (Hist. eccl., iv, 30) and Theodoret
          (Hær. fab., i, 22) mention dialogues against the teachings of
          Marcion; Eusebius and Epiphanius (l.c.) mention also an apology.
          An Armenian church history, composed in his exile, was used as
          source by Moses of Chorene. Ephraem Syrus (Serm. adv. hær.,
          liii) knew of a book of 150 psalms or hymns. By their hymns
          Bardesanes and his son Harmonius became the creators of the
          Syria, church hymn. Whether the hymns (e.g., the hymn on the
          destinies of the soul) preserved in the so-called Acts of Thomas
          (cf. W. Wright, Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles, i, London,
          1871, 247) are to be traced to Bardesanes, is doubtful.
          Eusebius, Epiphanies, and Theodoret mention also a work of
          Bardesanes "On Fate," which is extant under the title "The Book
          of the Laws of the Countries," though apparently revised by one
          of his disciples. Finally, George, Bishop of the Arabians,
          quotes a passage from a work of Bardesanes on "The Mutual
          Synodoi of the Stars of Heaven."

          It is impossible to assign to Bardesanes in the present state of
          knowledge the place which he occupies in Gnostic speculation.
          Some affinity with Valentinianism can be established from the
          work which has been preserved, which, however, reproduces the
          views of Bardesanes in a revised form. But there can be no doubt
          as to his connection with the Babylonian Gnosis. He was
          certainly greatly influenced by Chaldean mythology and
          astrology. His cosmogonic speculations, which Hort (DCB, i, 254)
          rightly calls "strange Mesopotamian heathenism," contain no
          special originality when compared with the Mandæan and Ophitic
          fancies. It is noteworthy that he retained the unity of the
          divine principle against the Marcionites, which does not
          preclude his speaking of an "eternal matter." His "Christ" is
          that of the Docetæ (who had no real body and did not really
          suffer). He denied the resurrection of the flesh. He made a
          mysterious connection between the soul and the celestial
          spirits. But in this determinism he saw only a natural
          limitation which did not preclude the free volition of man. For
          the rest, he explained his speculations only in narrower circles
          and seems to have kept silent about them in the presence of the
          congregation. Church history must not forget that Bardesanes won
          Edessa for Christianity. His influence was still strong in the
          time of Ephraem, who opposed him vigorously and hated him as the
          head of the three-headed monster, Marcion, Mani, Bardesanes.
          Nevertheless the people took pleasure in Bardesanes's fantastic
          religious poetry. Ephraem substituted orthodox hymns for the
          heretical, but retained the meter. The celebrated [919]Rabulas
          (d. 435) seems to have been the first to put an end to
          Bardesanism in Edessa. But it was not confined to Edessa; it
          spread to the Southern Euphrates, to Khorasan, even to China. In
          the West it seems to have been without influence, and to the
          real West it never penetrated.

   Barefooted Monks and Nuns
          BAREFOOTED MONKS AND NUNS: The popular name for members of
          various religious orders who go without any foot-covering
          whatever or with sandals in place of shoes. They are also called
          "discalced" (Lat. discalceati, "unshod"), but this name is more
          properly restricted to those who wear sandals and is used
          especially of the "discalced Carmelites." It is said that the
          custom was introduced in the West by [920]St. Francis of Assisi,
          who, with his companions, in 1209 discarded shoes in supposed
          obedience to Matt. x, 10, and thenceforth went wholly barefoot.
          There have been barefooted or discalced members of many orders,
          the Clarenines, Recollects, Capuchins, Poor Clares, Minimites,
          Augustinians, Camaldolites, Servites, Carmelites, Cistercians
          (Feuillants), Trinitarians, Passionists, and others. It is
          usually the stricter divisions of the order who adopt the
          practise.

          6, 1788; d. in London June 17, 1845. He studied at Brasenose
          College, Oxford, took orders in 1813, and in 1817 became curate
          of Snargate, Kent. In 1821 he removed to London as minor canon
          of St. Paul's and thenceforth resided in London, where he held
          different livings and positions. He was esteemed for his
          exemplary life, and his sound sense and kind heart made him a
          good counselor and valued friend. His fame rests upon the
          Ingoldsby Legends, written under the pseudonym "Thomas
          Ingoldsby" for Bentley's Miscellany and The New Monthly
          Magazine, collected in book form 1840; a second series was
          published in 1847 and a third, edited by the author's son, the
          same year (many later editions). In this work Barham proved the
          possession of humorous powers of a high order and produced what
          is perhaps the best collection of rimed mirth in the English
          tongue; his extraordinary command of language appears also in
          passages of much lyric beauty; and the satire of theological and
          church tendencies which have not yet passed away give the work
          more serious value than that of merely promoting amusement.

   Bar Kokba
          BAR KOK´BA: The name traditionally assigned to the leader of the
          great insurrection of the Jews in Palestine against the Romans
          under the emperor Hadrian in the years 132-135 (see
          [922]Israel). The Roman historians Spartian and Dio Cassius,
          however, give no name and do not even speak of one single
          prominent leader; nor does the name occur on the coins struck
          during the revolt, or, according to Derenbourg (p. 423), in the
          rabbinical authorities. It rests on Christian tradition
          beginning with Justin Martyr, an author likely to be well
          informed. In his larger "Apology" (xxxi) he speaks of the leader
          of the rising as Barchochebas, saying that he inflicted severe
          penalties on the Christians (regarded as apostate Jews).
          Eusebius (Hist. eccl., IV, viii, 4) reproduces this passage,
          with the variant spelling BarchOchebas, and confirms it in IV,
          vi, 2, where he says that the leader won his authority over the
          ignorant by basing on his name (meaning "star" or "son of a
          star") the claim to have been sent directly by God as a light to
          the oppressed. Beyond this Eusebius appears to know nothing of
          him except that in the last decisive battle, at the present
          Bittir (7 m. by rail s.w. of Jerusalem), in the eighteenth year
          of Hadrian (134-135), he suffered the penalty of his deeds.

          That the Jews had a native leader in this rising is clearly
          proved by the coins, both those which are adapted to Jewish use
          from coins of Vespasian and Trajan, and must thus belong to this
          period, and those which on account of similarity of treatment
          are evidently of the same date (cf. F. W. Madden, History of
          Jewish Coinage, London, 1864, 203 sqq., and Coins of the Jews,
          1881). The inscriptions of these give on the reverse sometimes
          "in [the year of] the freedom of Israel" alone, sometimes the
          same with the number 2 for the year, or "year 1 of the
          deliverance of Israel"; on the obverse sometimes "Eleazar the
          priest" (who must not be confounded with the uncle of Bar Kokba,
          the scribe Eleazar), sometimes "Jerusalem," claiming the right
          of coinage for the city, and sometimes "Simeon, prince of
          Israel." That the leadership of Simeon coincided with the
          priesthood of Eleazar is shown by a distinct variety which names
          Eleazar the priest on the obverse and Simeon, without any title,
          on the reverse. According to the coins, therefore, during the
          time of the revolt, Israel had a secular head of the name of
          Simeon; which leads to the hypothesis that the same man who
          inspired the people by the name of Bar Kokba was really called
          Simeon. This theory finds support in certain coins which show
          the letters of the name of Simeon on both sides of a temple
          portico above which is a star. Moreover, the Jewish accounts are
          consistent with it. The Seder Olam mentions the three and a half
          years of a native ruler as the epoch following the wars of
          Vespasian and Quietus, calling this ruler, however, "Bar
          Kozeba." And the Talmudic explanations to the Mishnah treatise
          Maaser sheni, when they forbid the payment of tithes with money
          coined by rebels or otherwise unauthorized, give as examples
          that of "Ben Kozeba" or the "coins of Kozeba" and the "coins of
          Jerusalem." By the analogy of the latter, the former might also
          be a local designation (cf. I Chron. iv, 22); but the variant
          form first given makes it much more probable that it is from the
          name of the ruler; and there is no difficulty in identifying
          this ruler with the Simeon already mentioned, especially as
          Jewish tradition, quoting (in the Talmud on Taanit) from Rabbi
          Akiba, shows how easy was the transformation of the name of Ben
          Kozeba into the form Bar Kocheba (or Bar Kokba), with its
          encouraging reference to the prophecy of Balsam (Num. xxiv, 17).

          Not much can be safely asserted of Bar Kokba's personality and
          achievements, for the Jewish sources mentioned above tell
          nothing trustworthy about him which is not already known from
          Dio Cassius, with the exception of his relations to Akiba and to
          Eleazar, whom, on suspicion of treachery, he is said to have
          killed with a kick. The immense number of his adherents (200,000
          men, who had pledged themselves to the conspiracy by cutting off
          a finger), the fabulous size of his citadel of Bittir, and the
          awful bloodshed there, are merely imaginative projections from
          the natural facts of such a rising. As a consequence of his
          failure, Bar Kokba has lived in Jewish memory as a deceiver; but
          one who could bring about so vigorous and stubborn a revolt and
          dominate it to its close must have been a man of great power and
          determination, who had made the nation's cause his own.

   Barlaam and Josaphat
          BARLAAM AND JOSAPHAT (or JOASAPH): The abbreviated title of a
          Greek religious romance commonly ascribed, without adequate
          reasons, to [924]John of Damascus. (d. about 754). The fuller
          title is "History of the Soul-profiting . . . of Barlaam and
          Josaphat (or Joasaph)." The popularity of the story is manifest
          from the fact that it was translated into Arabic, Ethiopic,
          Armenian, and Hebrew, as well as Latin, Icelandic, English, and
          other European languages. Research has proved that the work is
          based upon an Indian story (the Lalitavistara, composed 76
          A.D.), in which Buddha (transformed into Josaphat) is the hero.
          Josaphat is represented as son of Abenner, an Indian king
          bitterly opposed to the Christian religion. His future
          conversion to a new faith and fame as a religious leader are
          predicted at the time of his birth by astrologers. Every effort
          is made by his father to enthral him in pleasures, to conceal
          from him the miseries of the world, and to shield him from all
          influences calculated to impress him with a sense of obligation
          to the world. At last, weary of pleasure and ease, Josaphat goes
          forth to see the world, is driven to despair by its misery, and
          is converted by Barlaam, a Christian hermit. To overthrow his
          son's convictions the king arranges a disputation in which
          Nachor, a court sage, is to impersonate Barlaam and by a feeble
          defense of Christianity to discredit it. By special divine
          interposition Nachor makes a noble defense of Christianity,
          which leads to his own conversion, and that of the king and his
          people. Barlaam and Josaphat secured places in the Roman
          Catholic calendar as saints. It was discovered a few years ago
          by Prof. J. A. Robinson, by a comparison of the defense of
          Christianity in the Greek story with the newly discovered Syriac
          text of the long-lost "Apology" of Aristides (see
          [925]Aristides, Marcianus), that the former, modified to some
          extent to suit the purpose for which it was employed is the
          original of the "Apology." The Greek text is in MPG, xcvi, 860
          sqq.

          A. H. Newman.

          The story of Barlaam and Josaphat forms the subject of the chief
          poem of Rudolf of Ems, a Middle High German poet (d. between
          1250 and 1254), composed in 1220-23. It was based on a Latin
          book received from Abbot Guido of Cappel, which is said to have
          been a translation of the Greek legends of John of Damascus,
          already rendered by a certain Bishop Otho in the twelfth
          century. Rudolf, however, was unaware of this version or of
          another, which seems to have been made in the first half of the
          thirteenth century, and of which only a few fragments have been
          preserved. The story of the ascetic life of Buddha was highly
          attractive to a Christian ascetic, and Rudolf was the more drawn
          to the theme since he wished to atone for the frivolity of his
          earlier writings, declaring that this poem was no romance of
          knighthood, love, adventure, or the summertide, but a complete
          and sincere war upon the world, whereby men and women might be
          made better and purer.

          Rudolf's "Barlaam and Josaphat" contains about 16,000 verses,
          and describes the victory of Christianity over heathen
          teachings. It thus summarizes the Middle Ages, and accordingly
          rises far above the level of a mere revamping or even
          amplification of an original source. In the poem Josaphat is the
          son of a heathen Indian king named Avernier. Astrologers
          foretell the conversion of the prince, who is accordingly
          confined by his father in a palace built especially for him.
          Surrounded by every luxury, he is kept from all knowledge of
          age, disease, and death. Permitted, after a time, to leave the
          palace, Josaphat sees a lame man and a blind man, and on a
          second excursion meets a man weighed down with all the
          infirmities of age. When sobered by reflection on these sights,
          God sends him Barlaam, a hermit from the island of Sennaar, who
          appears in the presence of the prince disguised as a
          jewel-merchant. Only to the pure in heart, however, can he show
          the most precious gem, which, he at last tells Josaphat, is
          Christianity. He then describes the life of Christ, so that
          Josaphat asks concerning baptism, whereupon Barlaam tells him of
          baptism, eternal life, the chief doctrines of Christianity, and
          the lives of the saints and martyrs who renounced the vanity of
          the world. At the request of Josaphat, Barlaam baptizes him,
          administers the sacrament to him, and urges him to remain pure
          in word and thought. The king seeks in vain to win his son back
          to heathenism, but the priests are refuted, the magician Theodas
          is converted, and temptations to sensuality are overcome.
          Avernier then offers Josaphat the half of his kingdom, and his
          administration manifests the omnipotence of Christianity, while
          the glory of his father gradually wanes, and his councilors bow
          before the ethical power of the new faith. Meanwhile Josaphat
          prays to God to turn his father's heart, and in answer to these
          petitions the king takes counsel how he may atone for his former
          iniquity. His councilors advise him to follow the example of his
          son, whereupon he writes a pathetic letter to Josaphat, full of
          lamentations and self-accusations. Father and son met, Avernier
          was instructed by Josaphat, received baptism together with all
          his councilors, surrendered the entire kingdom to the prince,
          and lived as a hermit the remaining four years of his life.
          After his father's death, Josaphat appointed Barachias as his
          successor and became an anchorite, finding his teacher Barlaam
          again. He bravely resisted all manner of fleshly temptations,
          and lived with Barlaam in fasting and prayer until his teacher
          died. Josaphat buried him, and himself died at the age of sixty.

   Barletta
          BARLETTA: More correctly Gabriel of Barletta (on the e. coast of
          Italy, 33 m. w.n.w. of Bari), a Dominican of the fifteenth
          century. About 1480 he preached in different cities of northern
          Italy. His sermons (first collected at Brescia, 1497; often
          reprinted in the following century) have the usual scholastic
          form of the time, but are enlivened by an originality of ideas,
          a lively wit, and a sense of humor often grotesque, which gave
          rise to the adage, "He knows not how to preach who knows not how
          to barlettize." The moral seriousness of the sermons and their
          striking descriptions of the distress of the country and its
          lost greatness made them influential and powerful. In a history
          of popular preachers Barletta must have a chief place (cf.
          Zeitschrift für praktische Theologie, vii, 1885, 30 sqq.; viii,
          1886, 227 sqq.).

   Barnabas
          BARNABAS: The companion of the Apostle Paul, himself called an
          apostle in Acts xiv, 4, 14. According to Acts iv, 36, he was a
          Levite born in Cyprus, his original name was Joses, and he was
          surnamed by the apostles (in Aramaic) Barnebhuah, which is
          explained by the Greek huios parakleseos ("son of exhortation,"
          not "of consolation," cf. Acts xi, 23) and denotes a prophet in
          the primitive Christian sense of the word (cf. Acts xiii, 1; xv,
          32). Like his aunt, the mother of John Mark (Col. iv, 10),
          Barnabas seems to have been living in Jerusalem, and he sold his
          property, after having joined the Christian congregation in the
          first year of its foundation, for the benefit of needy
          coreligionists (Acts iv, 37; xii, 12). He soon occupied a
          leading place in the community.

  Authentic History

          Of his activity the Book of Acts records that he introduced the
          still distrusted Saul to the Jerusalem church after his return
          from Damascus (ix, 27). When the news of the spread of
          Christianity to Antioch came to Jerusalem Barnabas was sent to
          the former city (xi, 22-24). From Antioch he went to Tarsus to
          meet Paul and with him worked for an entire year in the Antioch
          church (xi, 23-26). Both were sent to Jerusalem with a
          contribution for the Christians of Judea (44 A.D.) and returned
          to Antioch with John Mark (xi, 27-30; xii, 25). The three were
          sent on a missionary journey to Cyprus, Pamphylia, Pisidia, and
          Lycaonia (xiii, 1 sqq.). In the narrative of this journey Paul
          occupies the first place from the point where the name "Paul" is
          substituted for "Saul" (xiii, 9). Instead of "Barnabas and Saul"
          as heretofore (xi, 30; xii, 25; xiii, 2, 7) "Paul and Barnabas"
          is now read (xiii, 43, 46, 50; xiv, 20; xv, 2, 22, 35); only in
          xiv, 14 and xv, 12, 25 does Barnabas again occupy the first
          place, in the first passage with recollection of xiv, 12, in the
          last two, because Barnabas stood in closer relation to the
          Jerusalem church than Paul. Paul appears as the preaching
          missionary (xiii, 16; xiv, 8-9, 19-20), whence the Lystrans
          regarded him as Hermes, Barnabas as Zeus (xiv, 12). After this
          journey follows a long stay in Antioch (xiv, 26-28) until they
          became involved in a controversy with the Judaizers and were
          sent to the Apostolic Council at Jerusalem, where the matter was
          settled (xv, 1-29; Gal. ii, 1-10; see [927]Apostolic Council At
          Jerusalem). According to Gal. ii, 9-10 Barnabas was included
          with Paul in the agreement made between them, on the one hand,
          and James, Peter, and John, on the other, that the two former
          should in the future preach to the heathen, not forgetting the
          poor at Jerusalem. Having returned to Antioch and spent some
          time there (xv, 35), Paul asked Barnabas to accompany him on
          another journey (xv, 36). Barnabas wished to take John Mark
          along, but Paul did not, as he had left them on the former
          journey (xv, 37-38). An unhappy dissension separated the two
          apostles; Barnabas went with Mark to Cyprus (xv, 39) and is not
          again mentioned in the Acts; but from Gal. ii, 13 a little more
          is learned about him, and his weakness under the taunts of the
          Judaizers is evident; and from I Cor. ix, 6 it may be gathered
          that he continued to labor as missionary.

  Legendary History

          Legends begin where authentic history ends. Barnabas is brought
          to Rome and Alexandria. The "Clementine Recognitions" (i, 7)
          make him preach in Rome during Christ's lifetime, and Clement of
          Alexandria (Stromata, ii, 20) makes him one of the seventy
          disciples. Not older than the third century is the tradition of
          the later activity and martyrdom of Barnabas in Cyprus, where
          his remains are said to have been discovered under the emperor
          Zeno (474-491). The Cyprian church claimed Barnabas as its
          founder in order to rid itself of the supremacy of the
          Antiochian bishop, just as did the Milan church afterward, to
          become more independent of Rome. In this connection, the
          question whether Barnabas was an apostle became important, and
          was often treated during the Middle Ages (cf. C. J. Hefele, Das
          Sendschreiben des Apostels Barnabas, Tübingen, 1840; O.
          Braunsberger, Der Apostel Barnabas, Mainz, 1876). The statements
          as to the year of Barnabas's death are discrepant and
          untrustworthy.

  Alleged Writings

          Tertullian and other Western writers regard Barnabas as the
          author of the Epistle to the Hebrews. This may have been the
          Roman tradition--which Tertullian usually follows--and in Rome
          the epistle may have had its first readers. But the tradition
          has weighty considerations against it. According to Photius
          (Quaæt. in Amphil., 123), Barnabas wrote the Book of Acts, and a
          gospel is ascribed to him (cf. T. Zahn, Geschichte des
          neutestamentlichen Kanons, ii, 292, Leipsic, 1890). Of more
          interest is the tradition which makes Barnabas author of an
          epistle in twenty-one chapters, contained complete in the Codex
          Sinaiticus at the end of the New Testament. A complete Greek
          manuscript was discovered by Bryennios at Constantinople, and
          Hilgenfeld used it for his edition in 1877. Besides this there
          is a very old Latin version (now in the imperial library at St.
          Petersburg), in which, however, chaps. xviii-xxi are wanting.
          Toward the end of the second century the epistle was in great
          esteem in Alexandria, as the citations of Clement of Alexandria
          prove. It is also appealed to by Origen. Eusebius, however,
          objected to it and ultimately the epistle disappeared from the
          appendix to the New Testament, or rather the appendix
          disappeared with the epistle. In the West the epistle never
          enjoyed canonical authority (though it stands beside the epistle
          of James in the Latin manuscripts). The first editor of the
          epistle, Menardus (1645) advocated its genuineness, but the
          opinion to-day is, that Barnabas was not the author. It was
          probably written in Alexandria in 130-131, and addressed to
          Christian Gentiles. The author, who formerly labored in the
          congregation to which he writes, intends to impart to his
          readers the perfect gnosis that they may perceive that the
          Christians are the only true covenant people, and that the
          Jewish people had never been in a covenant with God. His
          polemics are, above all, directed against Judaizing Christians.
          In no other writing of that early time is the separation of the
          Gentile Christians from the patriotic Jews so clearly brought
          out. The Old Testament, he maintains, belongs only to the
          Christians. Circumcision and the whole Old Testament sacrificial
          and ceremonial institution are the devil's work. According to
          the author's conception, the Old Testament, rightly understood,
          contains no such injunctions. He is a thorough anti-Judaist, but
          by no means an antinomist. The main idea is Pauline, and the
          apostle's doctrine of atonement is more faithfully reproduced in
          this epistle than in any other postapostolic writing. The author
          no doubt had read Paul's epistles; he has a good knowledge of
          gospel-history but which of the gospels, if any, he had read,
          can not be asserted. He quotes IV Esdras (xii, 1) and Enoch (iv,
          3; xvi, 5). The closing section (chaps. xviii-xxi), which
          contains a series of moral injunctions, is only loosely
          connected with the body of the epistle, and its true relation to
          the latter has given rise to much discussion.

   Barnabites
          BARNABITES (Clerici regulares S. Barnabæ): A congregation of
          regular clerics founded in the city and diocese of Milan in 1530
          by a nobleman of Cremona, Antonio Maria Zaccaria (b. 1502;
          educated at Padua and a physician by profession; ordained
          priest, 1528; d. 1539), with the help of his friends, Giacomo
          Antonio Morigia and Bartolomeo Ferrari, and two priests,
          Francesco Lucco and Giacomo Caseo. The region was then suffering
          severely from the wars between Charles V and Francis I, and the
          purpose was stated in the constitution to be the promotion of a
          love of divine service and the true Christian life by means of
          preaching and the frequent administration of the sacraments. The
          original and official name was Clerici regulares S. Pauli
          decolotti, which is found in the brief of Clement VII (1533)
          confirming the congregation as well as in the edict of Paul III
          (1535) which exempted the society from episcopal jurisdiction.
          In 1538 the grand old monastery of St. Barnabas by the city wall
          of Milan was given to the congregation as their main seat, and
          thenceforth they were known as the Regular Clerics of St.
          Barnabas. After the death of Zaccaria they were favored and
          protected by Archbishop Carlo Borromeo of Milan and later by
          Francis of Sales because of their successful missionary work in
          Upper Italy. They entered France under Henry IV in 1608, and
          Austria under Ferdinand II in 1626. In the last-named country
          they still have six monasteries, the chief being at Vienna. In
          Italy their houses are larger and more numerous (twenty in all),
          and that connected with the Church of S. Carlo a' Catanari in
          Rome is the most prominent and richest. The Order can boast of
          eminent scholars, as Gavanti, Niceron, Gerdil, Lambruschini, and
          Vercellone in the past, and Savi, Semeria, and others in the
          present.

          where he developed a great activity both for the moral and the
          material welfare of his flock. He published A New Version of the
          Psalms of David (Boston, 1752), and some sermons which show an
          incipient deviation from Calvinism.

   Barnes, Albert
          BARNES, ALBERT: Presbyterian; b. at Rome, N. Y., Dec. 1, 1798;
          d. at West Philadelphia Dec. 24, 1870. He was graduated at
          Hamilton College, Clinton, N. Y., in 1820, and at Princeton
          Theological Seminary, 1823; was ordained pastor of the
          Presbyterian church at Morristown, N. J., 1825; was pastor of
          the First Presbyterian Church, Philadelphia, 1830-67, when he
          resigned and was made pastor emeritus. He was an advocate of
          total abstinence and the abolition of slavery and worked
          actively in the Sunday-school cause. In 1835 he was brought to
          trial for heresy by the Second Presbytery of Philadelphia upon
          ten specifications (given in E. H. Gillett, History of the
          Presbyterian Church, revised ed., ii, Philadelphia, n.d., pp.
          473-474), but was acquitted. Appeal was then made to the Synod
          of Philadelphia (1835) and he was suspended from the ministry
          until he should repent of his errors. He appealed to the General
          Assembly of 1836 and the decision of the Synod was reversed. The
          agitation still continued and the trial was one of the active
          causes of the disruption of the Presbyterian church in the
          United States in 1837 (see [928]Presbyterians) and Mr. Barnes
          was a leader of the New School party; yet he lived to rejoice in
          the reunion in 1870. His Notes on the entire New Testament and
          on portions of the Old (Notes Explanatory and Practical on the
          New Testament, 11 vols., Philadelphia, 1832-53; revised edition,

          1844; Daniel, 1853; The Book of Psalms, 3 vols., 1868), designed
          originally for his congregation in Philadelphia, were eminently
          fitted for popular use and more than one million copies were
          sold; they are not original, but show much patient and
          conscientious labor. Other publications were Scriptural Views of
          Slavery (Philadelphia, 1846); The Church and Slavery (1857); The

   Barnes, Arthur Stapylton
          BARNES, ARTHUR STAPYLTON: Roman Catholic; b. at Kussouli (20 m.
          s.w. of Simla), India, May 31, 1861. He was educated at Eton
          (1874-77), Royal Military Academy, Woolwich (1877-78), and
          University College, Oxford (B.A., 1883), and was a lieutenant in
          the Royal Artillery in 1877-79. He later studied theology and
          was ordained to the Anglican priesthood. In 1889 he became vicar
          of St. Ives, Hunts, with Woodhurst and Oldhurst, and was vicar
          of the Hospital of St. Mary and St. Thomas, Ilford, from 1893 to
          1895, when he entered the Roman Catholic Church. He then studied
          at Rome for the priesthood and was engaged in diocesan work at
          Westminster until his appointment as Roman Catholic chaplain to
          Cambridge University. He has also been a Private Chamberlain to
          the Pope since 1904. In addition to numerous briefer studies, he
          has written The Popes and the Ordinal (London, 1896) and St.
          Peter at Rome (1899).

   Barnes, Robert
          BARNES, ROBERT: Church of England; b. at or near Lynn (26 m.
          n.e. of Ely), Norfolk, 1540; d. at the stake as a Protestant
          martyr, London, July 30, 1540. He studied at Cambridge, where he
          became an Augustinian friar, and at Louvain, where he proceeded
          doctor of divinity. Returning to Cambridge, he rose to be master
          of the house of the Augustinians. In 1526 he began to advocate
          Protestant views with great boldness, and so quickly got into
          trouble. Though treated leniently he was imprisoned from 1526 to
          1528, when he escaped to the Continent, where he lived till
          1531, and called himself Antonius Anglus. He enjoyed the
          friendship of the German Reformers. In Wittenberg in 1530 he
          published his first book, a collection of passages from the
          doctors of the Church--all in Latin--which supported, as he
          claimed, the Protestant position. In 1531 a German translation
          of these passages appeared in Nuremberg. In that year he
          returned to England and was employed on diplomatic journeys by
          Henry VIII and Thomas Cromwell, for instance to arrange the
          marriage between Henry and Anne of Cleves. He was always
          outspoken, and showed more zeal than prudence in propagating his
          Protestant views. So at last he was cast into prison in the
          Tower and, although no definite charge was laid against him, was
          burnt at Smithfield as a heretic. In 1573 John Foxe printed his
          English works (London) which display his courage, clearness, and
          comprehensiveness; selections were issued by Legh Richmond in
          his Fathers of the English Church (London, 1807)--in both the
          account of Barnes reprinted from Foxe's Monuments will be found.

          was ordered deacon in 1883 and ordained priest in the following
          year. He was curate of St.John's, Waterloo Road, Lambeth, in
          1883-85, assistant theological lecturer at Clare College,
          Cambridge, in 1885.-94, and assistant tutor at Peterhouse in

   Barnett, Samuel Augustus
          BARNETT, SAMUEL AUGUSTUS: Church of England; b. at Bristol Feb.
          8, 1844. He was educated at Wadham College, Oxford (B.A., 1865),
          and was ordered deacon in 1867 and priested in the following
          year. He was curate of St. Mary's, Bryanston Square, London, in
          1867-72, vicar of St. Jude's, Whitechapel, in 1872-93, and
          curate of the wane church in 1897-1903. In 1884 he founded
          Toynbee Hall, Whitechapel, of which he has since been warden, as
          well as chairman of the White chapel Board of Guardians, of the
          Children's Country Holiday Fund, and of the Pupil Teachers'
          Scholarship Fund. In 1893 he was appointed a canon of Bristol
          Cathedral, and was also select preacher at Oxford in 1896-97 and
          at Cambridge in 1900. In addition to minor contributions, he has
          written Practicable Socialism (in collaboration with his wife,
          London, 1893) and The Service of God (1895).

   Barnum, Henry Samuel
          BARNUM, HENRY SAMUEL: Presbyterian; b. at Stratford, Conn., Aug.
          13, 1837. He was educated at Yale College (B.A., 1862) and
          Auburn Theological Seminary, from which he was graduated in
          1867. In the same year he was ordained to the Presbyterian
          ministry, and for five years was a missionary of the American
          Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions at Harpoot, Turkey.
          Since 1872 he has been a missionary of the same organization at
          Van, Turkey, and since 1884 has also edited a weekly in Armenian
          and Turkish. He has likewise written a number of commentaries in
          Armenian.

          BARO (BARON), PETER: Anti-Calvinist; b. at Étampes (35 m. s.s.w.
          of Paris) Dec., 1534; d. in London Apr. 17, 1599. He studied law
          at Bourges, and began in 1557 to plead in the court of the
          Parliament of Paris, but retired in 1560 to Geneva, where he
          studied theology and was ordained by Calvin. In 1572 he returned
          to France, but soon fled from persecution to England and in 1574
          was appointed Lady Margaret professor of divinity at Cambridge.
          He fell out with the rigid Calvinists; and a sermon on the
          Lambeth articles, preached Jan. 12, 1596, gave so much offense
          that he was compelled to renounce his chair in the university
          and retire to London. Among his works are In Jonam prophetam
          prælectiones (London,1579); Summa trium de praedestinatione
          sententiarum (Hardwyck, 1613), translated in Nichols's Works of
          James Arminius, (London, 1825), 92-100.

   Baronius, Caesar
          BARO´NIUS, CÆSAR (Cesare de Barono):

    Life.

          The father of church history among Roman Catholics since the
          Reformation; b. at Sora (56 m. e.s.e. of Rome), in the kingdom
          of Naples, Oct. 31, 1538; d. in Rome June 30, 1607. His family
          was ancient and distinguished for piety. He was educated first
          at Veroli, then at Naples, where he studied theology and law. He
          went to Rome in 1557, just at the time when Paul IV was
          attempting to restore the papacy to its medieval splendor and
          dominion; but he felt less attraction to public policy than to a
          life of scholarly retirement. This he found in the new
          Congregation of the Oratory under [929]Philip Neri (q.v.) whose
          system prepared the young man, without his knowledge, for the
          great work he was to do. The Oratorians were directed by their
          founder to occupy the morning hours with studies in
          ecclesiastical matters, but in a manner which should conduce to
          instruction as well as to edification. More and more attracted
          by the study of church history thus required, Baronius began
          diligently to collect and compare materials for its prosecution,
          and worked for thirty years amidst the vast mass of unpublished
          material which the Vatican archives contained. He had apparently
          no far-reaching literary plans until he was called upon by his
          superior, by Cardinal Caraffa, and by other friends to utilize
          his stores of knowledge in the defense of the Church against the
          powerful attack which had been made upon it in the
          "[930]Magdeburg Centuries" (q.v.) and to provide a complete
          Roman Catholic church history such as did not then exist,--a
          desideratum which his Annales ecclesiastici supplied with no
          small credit to the author, considering the conditions of
          historical writing in the sixteenth century. The fame which he
          acquired by the execution of his task drew him unwillingly from
          his retirement. He was made prothonotary of the apostolic see
          and later, by Clement VIII in 1596, a cardinal, as well as
          librarian of the Vatican. At both the papal elections which
          occurred in 1605 he was a candidate against his will, and came
          near being chosen. But the exhausting labor involved in the
          completion of his huge work really caused his death two years
          later.

    The Annales Ecclesiastici.

          The Annales ecclesiastici begin with the birth of Christ and
          come down to 1198. In form they resemble the ordinary medieval
          chronicle, the events of each year being grouped together under
          the date without regard to any other connection. This form would
          have been well adapted to the author's purpose of offering the
          great mass of historical material to the reader as sources
          arranged in order, if it had been carried out with strict
          application of critical principles and the utmost exactness.
          Baronius tried, indeed, to meet these requirements; but with all
          his pains he did not altogether succeed. To say nothing of the
          limitations inseparable from his fundamental beliefs and
          polemical attitude, the errors in non-contentious points, such
          as dates, are so numerous as to make great care necessary in
          using the Annales. Nevertheless they are a storehouse of
          learning. Though the work was occasioned by the appearance of
          the "Magdeburg Centuries," it is not directly controversial. The
          opposition appears rather in the simple fundamental conception
          that true history can only be written by the aid of the
          documents to which he had access, guaranteed by the authority of
          the Roman Church, and that it is only necessary for these
          documents to be known in order to secure universal recognition
          of the claims of that Church. He agrees with the Centuriators as
          to the purity of the Church of the first six centuries; but
          while they endeavor to show that the Christianity of the Middle
          Ages was an actual apostasy from that happy state, Baronius does
          his best to demonstrate the continuity of Catholicism and the
          early existence of a distinctively Roman character in
          Christianity. His other writings are of far secondary
          importance.

          The first edition of the Annales appeared in 12 volumes at Rome,
          1588-1607; the Mainz edition, 1601-05, was revised by Baronius
          himself; that of Antwerp, 1597-1609, is noteworthy because
          Philip III suppressed vol. xi within his dominions because of
          the Tractatus de monarchia Siciliæ contained in it [separately
          printed, Paris 1609]. The Annales have been continued (1) from
          1198 to 1565 by Abraham Bzovius (8 vols., Rome, 1616 sqq.; 9
          vols., Cologne, 1621-30); (2) from 1198 to 1640 by Henricus
          Spondanus (Paris, 1640 sqq.; Leyden, 1678); (3) from 1199 to
          1565 by the Oratorian Odoricus Raynaldus (9 vols., Rome,
          1646-77; Cologne, 1693-1727; 14 vols., Lucca, 1740 sqq.), the
          best continuation; (4) from 1566 to 1571 by Jacobus Laderchius
          (3 vols., Rome, 1728-37; Cologne, 1738 sqq.); (5) from 1572 to
          1583 by Augustin Theiner (3 vols., Rome, 1856 sqq.). The Critica
          historico-chronologica in universos Cæsaris Baronii annales of
          F. Pagi (4 vols., Antwerp, 1705 sqq.; 1724) are an indispensable
          companion to the work. The most convenient edition is that of
          Mansi (38 vols., Lucca, 1738-57), which has Pagi's emendations
          appended to the text, the continuation of Raynaldus, and three
          volumes of valuable indices. The most recent edition
          (incomplete), with all continuations, appeared, vols. i-xxviii
          at Bar-leDuc, 1864-75, vols. xxix-xxxvii at Paris, 1876-83.

          24, 1808; d. at Germantown, Penn., Aug. 6, 1892. He was
          graduated at Bowdoin, 1832, and at the Harvard Divinity School,
          1838; became a Swedenborgian, 1839; was pastor of the New Church
          Society, New York, 1840-48; in Cincinnati 1848-50; after a
          temporary retirement because of ill health became pastor in
          Philadelphia; president and corresponding secretary of the
          Swedenborg Publishing Association, Philadelphia, 1871. He was
          editor of The Swedenborgian, 1858-60, and of The New Church
          Monthly, 1867-70 (when it was merged in The New Church
          Independent). He compiled and edited The Swedenborg Library,
          giving the substance of Swedenborg's theological teachings (12
          vols., Philadelphia, 1876-81). His books include a Life of
          Emanuel Swedenborg (New York, 1841); Lectures on the Doctrines
          of the New Church (1842; title afterward changed to Lectures on
          the New Dispensation); Beauty for Ashes, or the old and new
          doctrine concerning the state of infants after death contrasted
          (1855); The Golden Reed, or the true measure of a true church
          (1855); The Question concerning the Visible Church (1856; new

   Barrow (Barrowe), Henry
          BARROW (BARROWE), HENRY: English Separatist; hanged at Tyburn,
          London, Apr. 6, 1593. He came of good family in Norfolk, studied
          at Clare Hall, Cambridge, 1566-70, studied law, and was admitted
          a member of Gray's Inn in 1576. He belonged to the court circle
          and is said to have led a dissolute life until converted by a
          chance sermon. Probably through the influence of [932]John
          Greenwood (q.v.) he adopted the views of the Brownists. After
          Greenwood's arrest, Barrow visited him in prison and was himself
          illegally detained, Nov., 1586, and kept in confinement
          thenceforth till his execution. While in prison, in
          collaboration with Greenwood, he wrote several books and
          pamphlets, including A True Description out of the Word of God
          of the Visible Church (1589; cf. W. Walker, Creeds and Platforms
          of Congregationalism, New York, 1893, 28-40) and A Brief
          Discovery of the False Church (1590). Dr. Dexter's suggestion
          (Congregationalism of the Last Three Hundred Years, New York,
          1880, 192-202) that he wrote the [933]Marprelate Tracts (q.v.)
          has not met with general acceptance. He differed from Robert
          Browne in placing the government of the Church in the hands of
          elders rather than the entire congregation, fearing too much
          democracy. See [934]Congregationalists, I, 1, § 3. After the
          erratic leader of the Separatists had submitted to the Church,
          he turned his invectives against Barrow and Greenwood, who
          remained Separatists consistently to the end (see [935]Browne,
          Robert).

   Barrow, Isaac
          BARROW, ISAAC: Church of England; b. in London Oct., 1630; d.
          there May 4. 1677. He studied at Trinity College, Cambridge;
          traveled in Europe and the East, 1655-59, residing for more than
          a year in Turkey; was ordained on his return to England, and
          after the Restoration was made professor of Greek at Cambridge;
          became professor of mathematics in 1663, but resigned in 1669 in
          favor of his famous pupil, Isaac Newton, and devoted himself to
          theology. Charles II made him his chaplain and in 1673 appointed
          him master of Trinity; in 1675 he was made vice-chancellor of
          the university. His reputation is deservedly high as a scholar,
          mathematician, and scientist; his Treatise of the Pope's
          Supremacy (London, 1680) shows much skill in controversy; his
          sermons are elaborate and exhaustive, but ponderous in style and
          inordinately long. His theological works edited by John
          Tillotson appeared in four volumes at London, 1683-87; they have
          been several times reissued, the best edition being that by A.
          Napier (9 vols., Cambridge, 1859).

          graduated at Olivet College, Michigan, 1867; studied theology at
          the Yale Divinity School and Union Theological Seminary, New
          York, 1867-69, and at Andover, 1874-75; was ordained pastor of
          the Eliot Congregational Church, Lawrence, Mass., 1875; was
          pastor of Maverick Church, East Boston, 1880-81; of the First
          Presbyterian Church, Chicago, 1881-96; president of Oberlin
          College, Jan., 1899, till his death. He was chairman of the
          committee on religious conferences of the Columbian exposition
          of 1893, organized the Parliament of Religions at Chicago in
          that year, and published an account of it (2 vols., Chicago,
          1893); his Haskell lectures at the University of Chicago, 1895,
          were repeated, with many other addresses, in India and Japan the
          following year and were published under the title Christianity
          the World Religion (1897); in 1898 he was Morse lecturer at the
          Union Theological Seminary upon the topic The Christian Conquest
          of Asia (New York, 1899).

          1845. After being for a time a journalist and stenographer, he
          studied theology at Harvard Divinity School (B.D., 1875) and
          studied for a year at Leipsic. He was pastor of the First Church
          (Unitarian), Dorchester, Mass., from 1876 to 1880, and was
          editor of the Christian Register from 1881 to 1897. He has been
          since 1896 the United States representative on the International
          Prison Commission, and since 1900 the corresponding secretary of
          the Prison Association of New York. In 1897-99 he was a member
          of Congress for the tenth district of Massachusetts. His
          writings include: Life and Letters of Thomas J. Mumford (Boston,
          1879); The Doom of the Majority of Mankind (1883); Ezra Abbott
          (Cambridge, 1884); A Baptist Meeting House (Boston, 1885); and

          1741; d. at Paris Oct. 5, 1820. He was teaching in the Jesuit
          college in Toulouse when the order was suppressed in France
          (1764), and thereupon undertook extensive travels in Europe;
          returned to France in 1774 and wrote against the infidelity of
          the age as associate editor of the Année littéraire, after 1788
          as editor of the Journal ecclésiastique, and in his book, Les
          Helviennes ou lettres provinciales philosophiques (5 vols.,
          Amsterdam, 1784-88). In August, 1792, he fled from the
          Revolution to England and remained there till 1800. He published
          at London an Histoire du clergé pendant la Révolution française
          (2 vols., 1793); Mémoires pour servir a l'histoire du
          Jacobinisme (5 vols., Amsterdam, 1796-99; Eng. transl., 4 vols.,
          1798); L'évangile et le clergé français (1800). After his return
          to France he published Du pape et de ses droits religieux (2
          vols., Paris, 1803), which gave the Ultramontanes occasion to
          say that he had sold himself to Bonaparte. His work in general
          is marked by exaggeration and bitterness and he goes to an
          absurd extreme in opposition to the freemasons and secret
          societies.

          London; b. at London Jan. 15, 1826. He was educated at King's
          College, London, and Trinity College, Cambridge (B.A., 1848),
          where he was elected fellow in 1849. He was subwarden of Trinity
          College, Glenalmond, in 1849-54, headmaster of Leeds Grammar
          School in 1854-62, principal of Cheltenham College in 1862-68,

   Barsumas
          BARSU´MAS: 1. Archimandrite or abbot of a Syrian monastery,
          adherent of Eutyches and his doctrine. At the Robber Synod of
          Ephesus (449) he appeared at the head of a thousand rough and
          turbulent monks, and took part personally in the tumults which
          disgraced that assembly (see [936]Eutychianism). Two years later
          he presented himself at the Council of Chalcedon but was refused
          admittance. He continued to work for Eutychisuism till his death
          in 458. By the Jacobites he is honored as a saint and

          b. in Stuttgart July 13, 1799; d. at Calw (20 m. w. of
          Stuttgart) Nov. 12, 1862. He studied theology at Tübingen,
          became pastor of Möttlingen, near Calw, in 1824, but retired in
          1838 to Calw, and devoted himself entirely to the missionary
          cause. He founded the missionary society of Württemberg, and
          brought it in active cooperation with Basel and all the great
          missionary societies of the Christian world. He wrote some of
          the best German missionary hymns. He edited the Calwer
          Missionsblatt and wrote a great number of works of practical
          Christianity, and stories for children and youth, some of which
          met with an almost unparalleled success. Several were translated
          into English, e.g., The Autobiography of Thomas Platter (London,
          1839); Bible Stories for the Young (1845); Stories for Christian
          Children (2 series, 1851 and 1854).

   Bartholomew
          BARTHOLOMEW (Gk. Bartholomaios, Aram. Bar-Talmai, "Son of
          Talmai"): One of the twelve Apostles, mentioned in Matt. x, 3;
          Mark iii, 18; Luke vi, 14; Acts i, 13. Nothing is told in the
          New Testament of his work as an apostle. According to Eusebius
          (Hist. eccl., v, 10) and Jerome (De vir. ill., xxxvi), he
          preached the Gospel in India--that is, in what is called India
          to-day, not, as some have argued, Arabia Felix. Other Asiatic
          countries have been named as the scenes of his labors,
          especially Armenia, where he is said to have been flayed alive
          and crucified with his head down. Legend narrates that his body
          was miraculously conveyed to the island of Lipari, and thence to
          Benevento. His feast-day is usually the 24th of August; at Rome,
          however, it is celebrated on the 25th. An old and wide-spread
          theory (though Augustine, for example, did not accept it)
          identifies Bartholomew with Nathanael of Cana in Galilee (John
          i, 45-51; xxi, 2). That John counted Nathanael as an apostle is
          probable because in the former of these passages he represents
          him as joining the company of Jesus with the earlier and later
          apostles, and in the latter passage he mentions him in the
          company of apostles. In support of the theory, it is noticed
          that in the lists of the apostles in the synoptic Gospels
          (though not in the Acts) he is mentioned next to Philip, while
          Nathanael was brought to Jesus by Philip; and John nowhere
          mentions Bartholomew, while the synoptists do not mention
          Nathanael. But, on the other hand, it is remarkable that the
          synoptists do not give the other name for Bartholomew, if he is
          the same, while John speaks of Nathanael as if the reader would
          know at once who he was.

   Bartholomew of Braga
          BARTHOLOMEW OF BRAGA (known also as Bartholomæus de Martyribus
          from the church in Lisbon in which he was baptized): Archbishop
          of Braga 1558-82; b. at Lisbon 1514; d. at Viana (on the coast
          of Portugal, 40 m. n. of Oporto) July 16, 1590. He belonged to
          the Dominican order and took part in the Council of Trent, the
          decisions of which he introduced into Portugal. He founded the
          first clerical seminary in Portugal and won well-deserved renown
          by establishing hospitals and hospices. In 1582 Pope Gregory
          XIII allowed him to resign his office, and thenceforth he lived
          as simple monk in the monastery of Viana, giving instruction and
          performing works of mercy. He wrote Biblical commentaries, a
          Portuguese catechism, and a Compendium doctrinæ spiritualis
          (Lisbon, 1582; many later editions). An edition of his works,
          with life, by Malachias d'Inguimbert appeared in two volumes at
          Rome, 1727.

   Bartholomew of Brescia
          BARTHOLOMEW OF BRESCIA: A canonist of the thirteenth century.
          Little is known with any certainty of his life. He was born
          about the beginning of the century at Brescia, studied Roman and
          canon law in Bologna under Laurentius Hispanus, and afterward
          taught canon law there. He is principally remembered for his
          commentary on the Decretum Gratiani (about 1240), but he wrote
          several other works on canon law, which are usually not much
          more than revised editions of earlier works.

   Bartholomites
          BARTHOLOMITES: 1. A society founded at Genoa in 1307 by certain
          Armenian Basilian monks who had fled thither from persecution in
          their native land. They built there a church to the Virgin and
          St. Bartholomew, whence their name. Pope Clement V (1305-14)
          allowed them to follow their Eastern rite and customs, but in
          course of time they conformed to Western usages, and in 1356
          Innocent VI allowed them to choose a general. They existed at
          Genoa and in other places in Italy till 1650, when Innocent X
          suppressed the order.

          2. A congregation of secular priests founded at Salzburg about
          1643 by Bartholomäus Holzhauser, canon of Salzburg (b. at
          Langenau, near Ulm, 1613; d. at Bingen May 20, 1658). Their
          statutes, confirmed by Innocent XI in 1680 (complete text in
          Holstenius-Brockie, Codex regularum, vi, Augsburg, 1759,
          543-595), regulated their life on communistic principles, whence
          their official name, Institutum clericorum sæcularium in communi
          viventium, and their popular designation as "Communists." For a
          time the society flourished in the dioceses of South Germany as
          well as in Hungary, Poland, and Spain, but with the suppression
          of their last house, at Landshut, in 1804, they went out of
          existence.

   Bartoli, Daniello
          BARTOLI, b??r´´tO-lî´, DANIELLO: Italian Jesuit; b. at Ferrara
          Feb. 12, 1608; d. at Rome Jan. 13, 1685. He entered the Society
          of Jesus in 1623; was a distinguished preacher and teacher of
          rhetoric in different cities of Italy; in 1650 he became
          historian of his order at Rome. He wrote biographies, moral and
          ascetical works, and books upon physical science. His Istoria
          della compagnia di Giesù (5 vols., Rome, 1653-73), especially
          the part devoted to Asia, is replete with curious information;
          as an introduction to this work he wrote the Vita e istituto di
          S. Ignazio (Rome, 1650; Eng. transl., 2 vols., New York, 1856).
          His collected works were edited by H. Marietti (34 vols., Turin,

   Barton, Elizabeth
          BARTON, ELIZABETH: English impostor of the reign of Henry VIII;
          b., according to her own statement, in 1506; beheaded in London
          April 20, 1534. In 1525, while a servant at Aldington, Kent, her
          ravings in consequence of some nervous disorder gained for her a
          local reputation as one divinely inspired. She recovered her
          health after a few months, but her fame remained, and certain
          monks, notably one Edward Bocking, made use of her to attempt to
          check the advance of the Reformation. Instructed by them she
          continued her alleged prophesyings. In 1527 she was taken to the
          priory of St. Sepulchre at Canterbury, and under the title of
          the "Nun" or "Holy Maid of Kent" her fame went far and wide and
          she seems to have been partly or fully believed in by persons of
          intelligence and influence. When the divorce from Catharine of
          Aragon was proposed she inveighed against it and ultimately went
          so far in her threats against the king that she and certain of
          her abetters were arrested and brought to trial in 1533. Under
          torture Elizabeth and Booking confessed to fraud; with two
          friars and two priests they were beheaded at Tyburn, the Nun
          repeating her confession on the scaffold. Sir Thomas More,
          Bishop Fisher, and others were implicated and narrowly escaped
          suffering at the same time.

          I., in 1884-89, and lecturer on Bible languages in Haverford
          College in 1891-95, while in 1891 he was appointed professor of
          Biblical literature and Semitic languages at Bryn Mawr College,
          a position which he still holds. He has been a member of the
          American Oriental Society since 1888, of the Society of Biblical

          the Egypt Exploration Fund since 1904. He was president of the
          Oriental Club of Philadelphia in 1898-99, and a member of the
          council of the Society of Biblical Literature and Exegesis in
          1900-03, and in 1903-04 was one of the executive committee of

          acknowledged minister of the Society of Friends (orthodox). In
          theology he is in general agreement with the so-called "new

   Basedow, Johann Bernhard
          BASEDOW, b??´ze-dO´´ (BASSEDAU), JOHANN BERNHARD: German
          rationalist and innovator in educational methods; b. at Hamburg
          Sept. 11, 1723; d. at Magdeburg July 25, 1790. After a wilful
          boyhood he studied theology at Leipsic (1744-46), but followed
          his studies in very irregular fashion and hampered by poverty;
          he was tutor to a noble family of Holstein 1749-53; became
          teacher at the academy of Sorö, Denmark, in 1753, and at the
          gymnasium of Altona in 1761; he was forced to retire from both
          of these positions because of his unorthodox views freely and
          offensively expressed in various publications (Praktische
          Philosophie für alle Stände, Copenhagen, 1758; Philalethie: neue
          Aussichten in die Wahrheiten und Religion der Vernunft, 2 vols.,
          Altona, 1763-64; Theoretisches System der gesunden Vernunft,
          1765; Grundriss der Religion welche durch Nachdenken und
          Bibelforschen erkannt wird, 1764). After 1767 he abandoned
          theology for education. Influenced by Rousseau's Émile, he
          sought to devise a system that should be according to nature and
          dispense with the exercise of authority on the part of the
          teacher and with the necessity for work on that of the pupil.
          His views are set forth in his Vorstellung an Menschenfreunde
          und vermögende Männer über Schulen, Studien, und ihren Einfluss
          in die öffentliche Wohlfahrt, mit einem Plane eines
          Elementarbuches der menschlichen Erkenntniss (Hamburg, 1768; new
          ed., Leipsic, 1894) and his Elementarwerk (4 vols., 1774). He
          had remarkable success in enlisting sympathy and gaining
          patrons, and in 1774 was able to open an institution for the
          realization of his ideas, the "Philanthropin" at Dessau
          (described in Das in Dessau errichtete Philanthropinum, Leipsic,
          1774). After four years he retired, having shown himself, by
          loose management and personal bad habits, utterly unfitted for
          the position. He spent the rest of his life in literary work and
          private teaching. His writings on theological and educational
          subjects number more than sixty; the former are crude and
          coarse, and grossly rationalistic; the latter ill-considered and
          impracticable, although some of his ideas as developed by others
          have been productive of good. He was well characterized by
          Goethe as a man who undertook to educate the world, but himself
          had no education at all.

   Basel, Bishopric of
          BA´SEL, BISHOPRIC OF: The origin of this diocese probably goes
          back into the Roman period. Just above Basel, at the present
          Kaiseraugst, lay the Roman city of Augusta Rauricorum, which
          retained its importance well into the fourth century. Historical
          analogy justifies the supposition that Christianity was not
          unknown there. By the end of the fourth century the town must
          have sunk into decay, since the Notitia provinciarum Galliæ does
          not mention it. As, however, in the seventh century we hear of a
          bishop Ragnachar of Augusta, we are led to infer the retention
          of an older title; and when we find him also designated as
          Bishop of Augusta and Basel, we are able to understand this by
          the supposition that the see was transferred from the old
          decayed town to the rising city of Basel, which is mentioned as
          early as 374 by Ammianus Marcellinus. Apparently, then,
          Christianity in this region survived all the storms which raged
          there in the fifth and sixth centuries. After the establishment
          of Frankish rule, the diocese included the Alemannic districts
          between the Rhine and the Aar, the Alsatian Sundgau, the
          Burgundian Sorengau, and the northeastern part of the Elsgau.
          Its boundary, accordingly, was formed partly by the two rivers,
          partly by a line drawn from the Aar to the Doubs, thence to the
          southern slope of the Vosges, then along their crest, then to
          the Rhine at Breisach. [The Benedictine monk [941]Hatto or Haito
          (q.v.), bishop c. 805-822, was a trusted counselor of
          Charlemagne and his envoy to the emperor Nicephorus at
          Constantinople. At the end of the tenth century the bishopric
          developed into an imperial principality. It was at Basel that in
          1061 Cadalus of Parma was elected by the imperialists as
          antipope against Alexander II (see [942]Honorius II, Antipope);
          and Bishop Burkhard of Hasenburg (1071-1107) was one of the most
          influential counselors of Henry IV. Under the Hohenstaufen
          emperors also, the bishops of Basel were usually on the imperial
          side. After the council (see [943]Basel, Council of), the next
          important event in the history of the diocese is the outbreak of
          the Reformation, which occurred in the episcopate of the wise
          and pious Christopher of Utenheim (1502-27), and in spite of his
          efforts led to much turbulence and the ultimate suppression of
          the Roman Catholic religion in 1529. The university was
          suspended, and most of the professors left the town with Erasmus
          and Glarean. The bishop went to Pruntrut and the chapter to
          Freiburg, whence it did not return to the diocese until 1678. A
          succession of zealous prelates strove to undo the work of the
          Reformation (see [944]Jacob Christopher, Bishop of Basel). The
          territory of the diocese was incorporated with the French
          Republic, and at the Congress of Vienna with the cantons of Bern
          and Basel. In 1828 the see was reerected, and at present
          includes the Roman Catholic population of the cantons of Basel,
          Solothurn, Bern, Aargau, Zug, Lucerne, Schaffhausen, and
          Thurgau; the bishop resides in Lucerne.]

   Basel, Confession of
          BASEL, CONFESSION OF: A confession of faith submitted to the

          prepared by Myconius on the basis of a briefer formula put forth
          by OEcolampadius in his address at the opening of the synod in
          September, 1531. It is simple and moderate, occupying an
          intermediate position between Luther and Zwingli. Until 1826 it
          was read in the pulpits on Wednesday of Holy Week, but then was
          made binding on the clergy only; in 1872 it was set aside
          entirely. The confession was also accepted at Mühlhausen and is
          sometimes called the Mylhusiana; the first Helvetic confession
          is also called the Second Confession of Basel, because it was
          written there (see [945]Helvetic Confessions).

   Basel, Council of
          BASEL, COUNCIL OF:

    Attitude Toward the Pope.

          The last of the "reforming councils" of the fifteenth century.
          By the decree Frequens of the [946]Council of Constance (q.v.),
          a periodical repetition of ecumenical synods was enjoined. The
          first synod held accordingly at Pavia and Sienna, 1423-24 (see
          [947]Pavia, Council of; [948]Sienna, Council of), had passed
          without accomplishing anything. After the execution of John
          Huss, his victorious and uncompromising followers (see
          [949]Huss, John, Hussites) greatly embarrassed the Roman Church
          and the German empire, and Pope Martin V felt obliged to convene
          a new ecumenical council to meet in a German city. Basel was
          selected. The pope died shortly after, but his successor,
          Eugenius IV, a Venetian, had to confirm the convocation. His
          legates opened the council at Basel Aug. 27, 1431. But when it
          became known that the pope thought of dissolving it at once, as
          he expected nothing good from it, distrust of the pope filled
          the members of the council. On Feb. 15, [9] 1432, the council
          declared itself to be a continuation of that of Constance and
          therefore an ecumenical one, representing the Holy Catholic
          Church, and deriving its authority immediately from God;.
          therefore it could only dissolve itself of its own free will. In
          fixing the order of business, that of the Council of Constance,
          where the members were grouped according to nationality, was
          discarded; and four committees were formed: (1) on matters of
          faith, (2) on political affairs, (3) on ecclesiastical reforms,
          and (4) on general business. These committees met separately,
          each having its own president. The agreement of three of them
          was necessary to bring a question before a general session. The
          council was at first presided over by Cardinal Cesarini, or some
          other cardinal designated by the pope. But much was lacking to
          make the work of the council effective; the pope distrusted the
          Fathers of Basel and these distrusted the pope; both were ruled
          by party-hatred and passion; the highest aim of the council was
          the subjection of the pope to it. On Apr. 29, 1432, the pope and
          his cardinals were invited to come to Basel. As the former did
          not come, a process was instituted (Sept. 6) against him for
          contumacy. The council stood at that time in the zenith of its
          power, since it was recognized by most states, and Eugenius had
          to yield and expressly recognize the council Aug. 1, 1433.

    Relations with the Hussites.

          In the mean time the authority of the council had increased
          through its negotiations with the Hussites. On Jan. 4, 1433, the
          Hussites Procopius, the terror of Christendom, and John
          Rokyczana, the learned and fanatic orator, together with a
          numerous and brilliant [10] retinue, rode into Basel, not as
          penitent heretics, but with proud and fierce mien, as guests of
          the council. The negotiations with them resulted in an agreement
          in 1434 by which the so-called Compactata of Prague (see
          [950]Huss, John), embodying their principal demands, among
          others the use of the cup in the celebration of the Lord's
          Supper, were granted with modifications.

    Church Reform.

          Beginning in 1435, the council considered and issued a number of
          decisions, which concerned the reform of the Church in its head
          and members and the introduction of a better discipline, [11]
          but these measures were dictated by hatred to the curia, rather
          than by enthusiasm for reform. The annates, the pallium-money,
          the tax on the papal confirmation of ecclesiastical promotion,
          the judicial authority of the pope, the richest source of the
          revenues of the curia, were abolished and declared to be simony.
          Prospects of a compensation were held out, but not fixed. As
          concerns the spiritual offices the canonical chapter-election
          was reinstated in its full right, the papal reservations, with a
          few exceptions, were abolished, and strict provisions were made
          concerning the moral worthiness of those to be elected. The
          troublesome appeals to Rome were limited, also the election and
          number of the car dinals and their prebends. But the restriction
          of the sources of power of the curia when it needed revenues the
          most, excited the fierce opposition of the whole army of
          officials. In the council a small but strong party arose which
          wished to avoid a breach with the curia, a party of legates,
          headed by Cardinal Cesarini.

    Proposed Union with the Greek Church.

          Another matter, however, brought about a complete breach. The
          Greek emperor John Palæologus had addressed himself to both the
          pope and the council with a view of obtaining help against the
          menacing Turks through a union of the Greek and Roman Churches.
          The pope would [12] not concede that the glory of having brought
          about a union with the Greeks should belong to the members of
          the council; he and the minority at Basel wished the
          negotiations with the Greeks to be carried on in a city of
          Italy, whereas the antipapal majority at Basel wished the
          negotiations to be carried on there. The party of the legates
          left the council in 1437 and outwardly also sided with the pope.
          Of the cardinals only [951]Louis d'Allemand (q.v.) remained and
          the vacant seats of the bishops were filled by clerics of lower
          order. The council became more and more democratic. All regard
          for the pope now ceased; the council opened the process against
          him and the cardinals and on Jan. 24, 1438, he was suspended.
          The pope declared the council to be a company of Satan,
          excommunicated its members, and convened a countercouncil at
          Ferrara, which he soon removed to Florence, where he met the
          Greek emperor and his spiritual and secular retinue (see
          [952]Ferrara-Florence, Council of). He brought about the
          so-called Florentine union, which in itself was delusive and
          unreal, but greatly enhanced the fame of the pope in the eyes of
          his contemporaries, while the council at Basel deposed him June
          25 as a backsliding heretic.

    Decline and End of the Council.

          The governments took advantage of the differences of both
          parties. In France, the Synod of Bourges (1438) incorporated the
          decrees of the Council of Basel with the laws of the kingdom,
          the so-called pragmatic sanction of Bourges (see [953]Pragmatic
          Sanction). Germany declared in 1439 that it would keep neutral,
          and observed the neutrality for some time to the great detriment
          of the curia. Ultimately, however, almost all European
          governments sided with Eugenius. The council at [13] Basel
          persisted in its opposition under the direction of Allemand. On
          Nov. 5, 1439, it elected an antipope in the person of the Duke
          Amadeus of Savoy, who took the name of [954]Felix V (q.v.) and
          was crowned at Basel with great pageantry. He did not satisfy
          the expectations of the Fathers at Basel and was not recognized
          by the princes and nations. The German king, Frederick III, was
          especially averse to him, and the cunning secretary of the king,
          Æneas Sylvius Piccolomini (see [955]Pius II, Pope) secretly
          influenced the German church policy in favor of Eugenius, who
          lived to know, though dying, that the German king and most of
          the German princes had declared for him Feb. 7, 1447. Great
          concessions had indeed been wrung from the pope; they were
          afterward modified or not regarded at all. The tolling of bells
          and bonfires announced the victory of Rome. The German king
          withdrew his support of the council, and it decreed June 25,
          1448, to meet at Lausanne, where Pope Felix V had his residence.
          Ten months later the king of France induced the pope to resign,
          and the council, tired of the unending conflict, made Nicolas V
          his successor, whom the cardinals at Rome had appointed after
          the death of Eugenius. In this way it meant to preserve at least
          a semblance of authority, and in its last session, Apr. 25,
          1449, it decreed its own dissolution. In spite of the failure of
          the council the belief that the Church needed reformation
          persisted.

   Bashan
          BASHAN, bê´shan: The northeastern part of trans-Jordanic
          Palestine. The name occurs in the Old Testament in prose and
          sometimes in poetry with the article ("the Bashan"), indicating
          that bashan was originally a common noun, and its signification
          is made evident by the Arabic bathanah, "a fertile plain free
          from stones." The Greeks had the name in the forms Basan,
          Basanaitis, the LXX has Basanitis, and Josephus Batanaia and
          Batanea (cf. Eusebius and Jerome, Onomasticon). The location of
          the district is clearly noted in the Old Testament as the
          northern third of the plateau to the east of the Jordan (Deut.
          iii, 8; Joshua xiii, 11-12), with Gilead (the Yarmuk) as the
          southern boundary, Hermon on the north, and Salcah on the east.

          As soon as the traveler going east from the Sea of Tiberias
          crosses the Nahr-al-Allan, eighteen miles away, he may note the
          abrupt change of the structure of the plain. The numerous
          hillocks, a peculiarity of the Jaulan, disappear, as do the
          great lava blocks, and in their place one sees a great plain of
          mellowed, red-brown, fertile soil stretching away east, north,
          and south. The boundary of this on the northeast is the
          volcanic, wooded heights of Al-Kunetra and the base of Mt.
          Hermon, on the north the district of Wadi al-Ajam, on the east
          the Lejjah and Jebel Druz or Jebel Hauran, and on the south the
          plateau of Al-Hamad, with the stony Jaulan in the west. It is
          divided by two great wadies (Dahab and Zadi), which empty into
          the Yarmuk. Ruins abound, and on some of the hillocks are the
          graves of the former leaders and chiefs of the districts.

          The spongy, easily worked soil is a mixture of disintegrated
          lava, ashes, and sand from Jebel Hauran. To this composition is
          due the extraordinary fertility of the region, yielding half
          crops even in seasons of drought. The plain is almost treeless,
          the only exceptions being the old terebinths which stand by
          Arabic holy-places or vilages. The slope of the southern part,
          which is the granary of Syria, is quite sharp from east to west,
          while from north to south the altitude is about the same. The
          boundaries already noted (the steppe of Hamad and the Druz
          mountains) are prominent. The last are the "Salmon" of Ps.
          lxviii, 14-15. The region formed part of the kingdom of Og
          (Joshua xii, 5). It is celebrated in the Old Testament for its
          cattle (Deut. xxxii, 14; Ezek. xxxix, 18), and in these times
          probably served better a pastoral than a nomadic population. The
          "oaks of Bashan" (Isa. ii, 13; Ezek. xxvii, 6) have disappeared
          except on the foothills of the Hauran and Hermon mountains,
          where there are small groves, and along the Yarmuk.

          The following cities of Bashan are mentioned in the Old
          Testament: (1 and 2) Ashtaroth and Edrei, capitals of Og (Deut.
          i, 4, iii, 1; Joshua xii, 4); (3) Ashteroth Karnaim (Eusebius
          and Jerome, Onomasticon), not far from Job's grave [an Arab
          sanctuary], and near Shaikh Sad, until 1903 the seat of
          government; (4) Bozrah (I Macc. v, 26), at the southwest of the
          Hauran, containing ruins dating from Roman times; (5) Golan
          (Joshua xxi, 7), one of the Levitical cities of refuge, probably
          the modern Saham al-Jolan on the western edge of the plateau;
          (6) Karnain (I Macc. v, 26, perhaps Amos vi, 13, A. V. "horns"),
          not located; (7) Salcah, modern Salkhad, east from Bozrah, on
          the watershed, with a castle built in an old crater. These
          places are all on the edge of the plateau, as are the modern
          cities.

          The Old Testament mentions also the district Argob in Bashan,
          which had sixty cities (I Kings iv, 13; Deut. iii, 4), a
          possession of Jair (Deut. iii, 14, but cf. Judges x, 3 sqq., I
          Kings iv, 13), and in the eastern part of the Jaulan.

   Bashford, James Whitford
          BASHFORD, JAMES WHITFORD: Methodist Episcopal bishop; b. at
          Fayette, Wis., May 25, 1849. He was educated at the University
          of Wisconsin (B.A., 1873), the Theological School of Boston
          University (B.D., 1876), the School of Oratory in the same
          institution (1878), and Boston University (Ph.D., 1881). He was
          tutor in Greek at the University of Wisconsin in 1873-74, and
          held successive pastorates at Harrison Square Methodist
          Episcopal Church, Boston (1875-78), Jamaica Plain, Boston
          (1878-81), Auburndale, Mass. (1881-84), Chestnut Street,
          Portland, Me. (1884-87), and Delaware Ave., Buffalo, N. Y.
          (1887-89). He was president of Ohio Wesleyan University in
          1889-1904, and in the latter year was chosen bishop, and in this
          capacity went to Shanghai, China. In theology he is distinctly
          liberal, believing that Christianity can be better interpreted
          from the point of view of evolution than from the older
          standpoint, and being confident that higher criticism, if used
          with sound scholarship, will not endanger the fundamentals of
          Christianity. He has written: Science of Religion (Delaware, O.,
          1893); Wesley and Goethe (Cincinnati, 1903); and Methodism in
          China (1906).

   Basil of Achrida
          BASIL OF ACHRIDA: Archbishop of Thessalonica. He came from
          Achrida (on the n.e. shore of the modern Lake Ochrida, 100 m. n.
          of Janina, in Albania) in Macedonia and became archbishop in
          1146. His importance lies in the fact that he wrote and spoke
          against the union of the Greek Church with the Roman. He wrote a
          letter on the subject to Pope Adrian IV in 1154. To about the
          same time belong his dialogues with Anselm of Havelberg,
          ambassador of Frederick Barbarossa, published by J. Schmidt in
          Des Basilius aus Achrida bisher unedirte Dialoge (Munich, 1901).
          Another dialogue with Henry of Benevento is still in manuscript.
          Vasiljewskij has published an address of Basil's on the death of
          Irene, first wife of the Emperor Manuel Comnenos, in Vizantijskÿ
          Vremnik, 1894, 55-132. His earlier printed writings are in MPG,

   Basil of Ancyra
          BASIL (BASILAS) OF ANCYRA: A physician, born at Ancyra, and
          bishop there from 336, succeeding [956]Marcellus (q.v.). He was
          deposed by the Synod of Sardica in 343, reinstated by
          Constantius in 350, and, with [957]George of Laodicea (q.v.),
          became the leader of the homoiousian middle party. In 360 he was
          banished to Illyria, and died in exile. With George he composed
          a dogmatic memoir and, according to Jerome, also a writing
          against Marcellus, a treatise on virginity, and "some other
          things." The sources are Socrates, Hist. eccl., ii, 26, 42; iii,

   Basil, Saint, The Great
          BASIL, SAINT, THE GREAT:

    Earlier Life.

          Bishop of Cæsarea in Cappadocia; b. at Cæsarea, of a wealthy and
          pious family, c. 330; d. there Jan. 1, 379. He was somewhat
          younger than his friend, Gregory Nazianzen, and several years
          older than his brother, Gregory of Nyssa, who, with him, are
          known as the three great Cappadocians. The first years of his
          life Basil spent on a rural family estate under the guidance of
          his grandmother, [959]Macrina (q.v.), whom he always remembered
          with gratitude. He received his literary education at first in
          Cæsarea, then at Constantinople, finally at the great school in
          Athens, where he became intimate with Gregory and the future
          emperor Julian. The practical ideal of pure Christianity, the
          elevation of the soul above sensuality, the flight from the
          world, and the subjection of the body were already apparent in
          him. The family tendency to an ascetic life proved decisive
          after his return to Cæsarea (c. 357). For a time, indeed, he
          acted as rhetor, but he resisted exhortations to devote himself
          to the education of youth. At this time he seems to have
          received baptism, and, after being received into the Church, he
          visited the famous ascetics in Syria, Palestine, and Egypt. To
          the dogmatic controversies which stirred the Church he paid no
          attention, though he deplored them. Upon his return to Cæsarea
          he distributed his property among the poor and withdrew to a
          lonely romantic district, attracting like-minded friends to a
          monkish life, in which prayer, meditation, and study alternated
          with agriculture. [960]Eustathius of Sebaste (q.v.) had already
          labored in Pontus in behalf of the anchoretic life and Basil
          revered him on that account, although the dogmatic differences,
          which then estranged so many hearts, gradually separated these
          two men also. Siding from the beginning and at the Council of
          Constantinople in 360, with the Homoiousians, Basil went
          especially with those who overcame the aversion to the
          homoousios in common opposition to Arianism, thus drawing nearer
          to Athanasius (see [961]Arianism). He also became a stranger to
          his bishop, Dianius of Cæsarea, who had subscribed the Nicene
          form of agreement, and became reconciled to him only when the
          latter was about to die.

    Presbyter and Bishop of Cæsarea.

          In 364 Basil was made a presbyter of the Church at Cæsarea and
          as such opposed the new bishop Eusebius, who was not favorably
          disposed toward asceticism. For a time he again withdrew to
          solitude, but the increasing influence of Arianism induced him
          to devote his undivided strength to ecclesiastical affairs. He
          now appears as the real leader of the Church of Cæsarea, [14]
          and in directing the church discipline, in promoting monachism
          and ecclesiastical asceticism, and especially by his powerful
          preaching, his influence grew. His successful exertions during
          the famine in the year 368 are especially praised. After the
          death of Eusebius (370), Basil was elected bishop of Cæsarea in
          spite of much opposition on dogmatic and personal grounds; even
          his friend Gregory felt offended. Occupying one of the most
          important episcopal sees of the East, Basil's influence on
          public affairs was now great. With all his might he resisted the
          emperor Valens, who strove to introduce Arianism, and impressed
          the emperor so strongly that, although inclined to banish the
          intractable bishop, he left him unmolested. To save the Church
          from Arianism Basil entered into connections with the West, and
          with the help of Athanasius, he tried to overcome its
          distrustful attitude toward the Homoiousians. The difficulties
          had been enhanced by bringing in the question as to the essence
          of the Holy Spirit. Although Basil advocated objectively the
          consubstantiality of the Holy Spirit with the Father and the
          Son, he belonged to those, who, faithful to Eastern tradition,
          would not allow the predicate homoousios to the former; for this
          he was reproached as early as 371 by the Orthodox zealots among
          the monks, and Athanasius defended him. His relations also with
          Eustathius were maintained in spite of dogmatic differences and
          caused suspicion (see [962]Eustathius of Sebaste). On the other
          hand, Basil was grievously offended by the extreme adherents of
          Homoousianism, who seemed to him to be reviving the Sabellian
          heresy. The end of the unhappy factional disturbances and the
          complete success of his continued exertions in behalf of Rome
          and the East, he did not live to see. He suffered from liver
          complaint and excessive asceticism made him old before his time
          and hastened his early death. A lasting monument of his
          episcopal care for the poor was the great institute before the
          gates of Cæsarea, which was used as poorhouse, hospital, and
          hospice.

    Writings.

          Of Basil's writings, mention may be made (1) of the
          dogmatic-polemical, including the books against [963]Eunomius of
          Cyzicus (q.v.) entitled "Refutation of the Apology of the
          Impious Eunomius," written in 363 or 364; book i controverts
          Arianism, books ii and iii defend the Homoousianism of the Son
          and the Spirit. The fourth and fifth books do not belong to
          Basil, or to [964]Apollinaris of Laodicea (q.v.), [15] but
          probably to [965]Didymus of Alexandria (q.v.). The work "On the
          Holy Spirit" (ed. C. F. H. Johnston, Oxford, 1892; transl. by G.
          Lewis, Christian Classics Series, iv, London, 1888) also treats
          the questions of Homoousianism. Basil influenced the fixing of
          the terminology of the church-doctrine of the Trinity, though as
          concerns dogmatic acuteness and speculative power he is far
          behind Athanasius and his brother Gregory (of Nyssa). (2) The
          ascetic works (ascetica) are religio-ethical writings which
          acquaint us with the man who in a high degree labored for the
          naturalization of monasticism in the Church, and who at the same
          time exerted himself to regulate it in the cenobitic form and to
          make it fruitful also for the religious life of the cities (cf.
          A. Kranich, Die Ascetik in ihrer dogmatischen Grundlage bei
          Basilius dem Grossen, Paderborn, 1896). Of the monastic rules
          traced to Basil, the shorter is the one most probably his work
          (see [966]Basilians). (3) Among the numerous homilies and
          orations, highly appreciated by the early Church, some like that
          against usury and that on the famine in 368, are valuable for
          the history of morals; others illustrate the worship of martyrs
          and relics; the address to young men on the study of classical
          literature shows that Basil was lastingly influenced by his own
          education, which taught him to appreciate the propædeutic
          importance of the classics. His homilies on the Hexaemeron were
          especially valued. (4) The very numerous epistles are an
          important source of contemporaneous church history. His three
          "Canonical Epistles" give a clear idea of his efforts in behalf
          of church discipline. (5) The liturgies bearing the name of
          Basil (ed. with transl. by J. N. W. B. Robertson, London, 1894),
          in their present form, are not his work, but they nevertheless
          preserve the true recollection of Basil's activity in this field
          in formularizing liturgical prayers and promoting church-song.
          (6) A fruit of Basil's studies with his friend Gregory in their
          monkish loneliness is, finally, the Philokalia, an anthology
          (florilegium) from the works of Origen (ed. J. A. Robinson,
          Cambridge, 1893). The best edition of Basil's works is that of
          J. Garnier and Prudence Maran (3 vols., Paris, 1721-30),
          reprinted in MPG, xxix-xxxii. The "Holy Spirit," homilies of the
          Hexaemeron, and letters are translated in NPNF, viii.

   Basil of Seleucia
          BASIL OF SELEUCIA: Bishop of Seleucia in Isauria. He was against
          Eutyches at the Synod of Constantinople in 448, but for him at
          Ephesus in 449, and escaped deposition at Chalcedon in 451 only
          by again changing his vote. In 458, with the other Isaurian
          bishops, he gave an answer to the emperor Leo I favorable to
          Chalcedon and against Timotheus Ælurus (cf. the document in
          Mansi, vii, 559-563; see [967]Timotheus Ælurus). His extant
          works are forty-one sermons in pompous style and dependent on
          Chrysostom (cf. Photius, cod. clxviii) and a writing on the life
          of St. Thecla (cf. R. A. Lipsius, Die apokryphen
          Apostelgeschichten, ii, part 1, Brunswick, 1887, p. 426). They
          are in MPG, lxxxv.

   Basilians
          BASILIANS: Monks or nuns following the rule of St. Basil, who
          introduced the cenobitic life into Asia Minor, and is said to
          have founded the first monastery there. The rules which he gave
          this community connected active industry and devotional
          exercises in regular succession, day and night,--one meal a day,
          consisting of bread and water; very little sleep during the
          hours before midnight; prayers and singing, morning, noon, and
          evening; work in the fields during forenoon and afternoon; etc.
          These rules were further developed and completed by Basil's
          ascetic writings. After the separation between the Eastern and
          Western churches, Basil's rule became almost the exclusive
          regulation of monastic life in the Eastern Church; so that a
          "Basilian" simply means a monk of the Greek Church. In the
          Western Church the rule of Basil was afterward completely
          superseded by that of Benedict of Nursia. Nevertheless, Basilian
          monasteries, acknowledging the supremacy of the Pope, are still
          lingering in Sicily and in the Slavonian countries. See
          [968]Basil, Saint, the Great; [969]Monasticism.

   [7] The term "patesi" is used in different ways: a man may be a patesi
   of a god, of a city, of a king, of men, and of a festival. These
   different ways of using the word seem to be equivalent, respectively,
   to the words priest, subordinate ruler, viceroy, shepherd, and
   director. It indicates subordinate rank, therefore, and seems to be
   used politically in contradistinction to the term king; though the king
   of the land may be at the same time the patesi of a god.

   [8] The identification of Eri-aku, Kudur-Lagamur, and Hammurabi with
   the Arioch, Chedorlaomer, and Amraphel of Gen. xiv has been made to do
   illegitimate service in supporting that chapter. The inscription in
   which the names were thought to occur belongs to the period of the
   Arsacidæ and does not contain the name of Chedorlaomer. But the "Tidal"
   of Gen. xiv is probably the Tud-k?ula of the tablet in question, and
   "Arioch of Ellasar" of Genesis is probably Eri-aku, son of Kudur-Mabug.
   The probability is now acknowledged that Gen. xiv is drawn from very
   late sources, of which this tablet may have been one.
