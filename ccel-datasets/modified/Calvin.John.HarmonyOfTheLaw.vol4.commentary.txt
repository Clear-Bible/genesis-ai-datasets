   Deuteronomy 1

   Deuteronomy 1:6-8

   6. The Lord our God spoke unto us in Horeb, saying, Ye have dwelt long
   enough in this mount:

   6. Jehova Deus noster loquutus est nobis in Horeb, dicendo: Sat vobis
   est habitasse in monte isto.

   7. Turn you, and take your journey, and go to the mount of the
   Arnorites, and unto all the places nigh thereunto, in the plain, in the
   hills, and in the vale, and in the south, and by the sea-side, to the
   land of the Canaanites, and unto Lebanon, unto the great river, the
   river Euphrates.

   7. Vertite vos, et proficiscimini, et ite ad montem Amorrhmorum, et ad
   omnes vicinos ejus, in solitudine, in monte, et planitie, et rueridle,
   et in littore marls, terrain Chenanaei a Lebanon usque ad flumen magnum
   flumen Euphraten.

   8. Behold, I have set the land before you: go in and possess the land
   which the Lord. swore unto your fathers, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, to
   give unto them, and to their seed after them.

   8. Vide, dedi coram vobis terram, ingredimini, et possidete terram
   illam quam juravit Jehova patribus vestris, Abraham, Isaac et Jacob, se
   daturum eis, et semini eorum post ipsos.

   6. The Lord our God spoke to us in Horeb. In this Second Narration,
   Moses expressly declares that God not only gave them a visible sign, by
   uplifting the cloud, but that He also verbally commanded the people to
   leave Mount Sinai, and to set about the performance of the rest of
   their journey. God says, then, that enough time had been spent in one
   place; [1] for, before they left it, an entire year had passed away
   there. Although there were eleven days' journey before them before they
   would arrive at Kadesh-barnea, nevertheless, lest anything should delay
   the people, who were naturally but too indolent, tie stimulates them by
   setting before them the ease with which it might be accomplished,
   telling them that they had but to lift up their feet and advance, in
   order to attain the promised rest.

   Numbers 9

   Numbers 9:17-23

   17. And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle, then after
   that the children of Israel journeyed: and in the place where the cloud
   abode, there the children of Israel pitched their tents.

   17. Quum discederet nubes a tabernaculo, postea proficiscebantur filii
   Israel: atque in loco ubi manebat nubes, illic castrametabantur filii
   Israel.

   18. At the commandment of the Lord the children of Israel journeyed,
   and at the commandment of the Lord they pitched: as long as the cloud
   abode upon the tabernacle they rested in their tents.

   18. Ad os Jehovae proficiscebantur filii Israel, et ad os Jehovae
   castrametabantur: cunctis diebus quibus stabat nubes supra
   tabernaculum, manebant.

   19. And when the cloud tarried long upon the tabernacle many days, then
   the children of Israel kept the charge of the Lord, and journeyed not.

   19. Quum autem moram trahebat nubes supra tabernaculum diebus multis,
   tunc observabant filii Israel custodiam Jehovae, et non
   proficiscebantur.

   20. And so it was, when the cloud was a few days upon the tabernacle;
   according to the commandment of the Lord they abode in their tents, and
   according to the commandment of the Lord they journeyed.

   20. Quando autem nubes paucis diebus erat super tabernaculum, ad os
   Jehovae manebant, et ad os Jehovae proficiscebantur.

   21. And so it was, when the cloud abode from even unto the morning, and
   that the cloud was taken up in the morning, then they journeyed:
   whether it was by day or by night that the cloud was taken up, they
   journeyed.

   21. Quando igitur erat nubes a vespera usque mane, ascendebat autem
   nubes mane, tunc proficiscebantur: aut si nocte et die, et postea
   ascendebat nubes, tunc proficiscebantur.

   22. Or whether it were two days, or a month, or a year, that the cloud
   tarried upon the tabernacle, remaining thereon, the children of Israel
   abode in their tents, and journeyed not: but when it was taken up, they
   journeyed.

   22. Aut duobus diebus, aut mense, aut anno, quando moram trahebat nubes
   super tabernaculum, manendo super illud, in castris manebant filii
   Israel, nec proficiscebantur: si autem illa ascendebat, tunc
   proficiscebantur.

   23. At the commandment of the Lord they rested in the tents, and at the
   commandment of the Lord they journeyed: they kept the charge of the
   Lord, at the commandment of the Lord by the hand of Moses.

   23. Ad os Jehovae castrametabantur, et ad os Jehovae proficiscebantur:
   custodiam Jehovae servabant ad os Jehovae per manum Mosis.

   17. And when the cloud was taken up from the tabernacle. Moses before
   informed us that the tabernacle was so distinguished by a visible
   miracle, that God made it manifest that He dwelt there: not that He
   left heaven and removed to that earthly house, but in order to be nigh
   to His people by the presence of His power and grace, whenever He was
   invoked by them. He now reports another miracle, that God, by uplifting
   the cloud, gave a sign, as it were, by which He commanded them to
   strike the camp; and when the cloud rested on the tabernacle, it was a
   sign that they should abide where they were. Here, however, a question
   arises; since it has been already said that, immediately after their
   departure from Egypt, the cloud was like a banner to direct the march
   of the people, it follows that they were not now for the first time
   admonished by its being lifted up to collect their baggage, and ordered
   as it were to advance. The answer is easy, that the people were indeed
   previously directed by the sight of the cloud, as we have seen; but
   that here a new fact is related, viz., that since the tabernacle was
   set up, the cloud, which hitherto was suspended in the air and went
   before the camp, now settled on the sanctuary: for a fresh acquisition
   of grace is here proclaimed by the more certain and conspicuous sign,
   as if God showed himself more closely and familiarly as the leader of
   the people. Although, therefore, the cloud had been the director of
   their march from its very commencement, yet it more fully illustrated
   the glory of the tabernacle when it proceeded from thence.

   18. At the commandment of the Lord. [2] The mouth is here used by
   metonymy for the speech; nor does there appear to me to be so much
   harshness in the Hebraism, but that it may be appropriately retained.
   But it is asked whether God actually spoke or not; for the word mouth
   is often repeated. It is indeed likely that Moses was instructed but
   once what was meant by the removal or remaining of the cloud; yet I
   doubt not but that the name of word, or commandment, was given to the
   sign, inasmuch as God speaks as much to the eyes by outward signs as He
   does to the ears by His voice. Still, from this mode of expression we
   may gather that the use of signs [3] is perverted and nullified, unless
   they are taken to be visible doctrine, as Augustin writes. The
   repetition, which certainly has no little force, shows how worthy this
   is of observation.

   19. Then the children kept the charge of the Lord. Some, [4] in my
   opinion, extend this too far, thinking that when the cloud tarried, the
   children of Israel, being as it were at leisure, employed themselves in
   the worship of God; but I restrict it rather to that heedfulness which
   is then praised at some length. To keep the charge (custodiam,) then,
   is equivalent to regarding the will of God with the greatest
   earnestness and care. For, when the cloud had begun to rest in any
   place, the people knew that they were to remain there; but if on the
   next day they were not attentive, the cloud might vanish, and thus
   their neglect and carelessness might deprive them of this incomparable
   advantage.

   To this end it is said immediately afterwards that, If for one day, or
   more, or even for a month, or a year, the cloud stood still, the people
   was, as it were, tied to the spot. The old interpreter [5] has not
   badly rendered it, "The children of Israel were upon the watch;" since
   day and night they anxiously expected the time when God would command
   them to move forward. The last verse of the chapter confirms this
   sense, where it is again added, that "they kept the charge of the Lord
   at His mouth by the hand of Moses:" whence it appears that Moses was
   God's interpreter, so that they might set forth on their march whenever
   the cloud being lifted up pointed out to them the way. Nor can it be
   doubted but that it preceded them; so that they might know in what
   direction God would have them proceed, and whither they were to go.
   Moreover, it must be observed that in both respects it is counted
   worthy of praise in the people, that they should either journey, or
   continue where they were, at God's command. Thus is that absurd
   activity condemned which engages itself in endless work; as if men
   could only obey God by turmoil. Whereas it is sometimes no less a
   virtue to rest, when it so pleases God. [6]

   [2] "At the mouth of the Lord." -- Lat.

   [3] "Des sacremens." -- Fr. I cannot find that Augustin anywhere uses
   the exact words which C. here attributes to him. In his Tract. in
   Evang. Johan., 80. Section 3, however, he says, "Detrahe verbum, et
   quid est aqua nisi aqua? Accedit verbum ad elementum, et fit
   sacramentum, etiam ipsum tanquam visibile verbum." (Edit. Bened. vol.
   3, part. 2, p. 703.) And again, Contra Faustum, lib. 19. cap. 16: "Quid
   enim sunt aliud quaeque corporalia sacramenta, nisi quaedam quasi verba
   visibiliar? Etc. Vol. 8:32l. Both these passages are quoted by C. Inst.
   4, 14. Section 6.

   [4] Dathe agrees with Malvenda and other ancient commentators in
   adopting the opinion here rejected by C. "The sense of the passage (he
   says) is, that the Israelites set up the holy tabernacle, and observed
   the holy rites, if they were detained for many days in one place; but
   if for a short time only, the tabernacle was not set up. Whether this
   was to be the case or not was indicated to them by Moses, according to
   ver. 23."

   his blindness.

   Exodus 40

   Exodus 40:36-38

   36. And when the cloud was taken up from over the tabernacle, the
   children of Israel went onward in all their journeys:

   36. Quum recederet nubes a tabernaculo, proficiscebantur filii Israel
   in cunctis profectionibus suis:

   37. But if the cloud were not taken up, then they journeyed not till
   the day that it was taken up.

   37. Quod si non recederet nubes, non proficiscebantur usque ad diem qua
   recedebat.

   38. For the cloud of the Lord was upon the tabernacle by day, and fire
   was on it by night, in the sight of all the house of Israel, throughout
   all their journeys.

   38. Quia nubes Jehovae erat super tabernaculum interdiu, ignis vero
   noctu in eo, coram oculis totius domus Israel, in cunctis
   profectionibus eorum.

   38. For the cloud of the Lord was on the tabernacle. Moses more
   distinctly explains what he had said generally respecting the cloud,
   viz., that by night a fiery column appeared, because the cloud would
   not have been visible amidst the darkness. A second explanation is also
   added, that this did not happen once or twice only, but "in all their
   journeys;" so that they were never without a sight of the cloud, which
   might be a witness of God's presence, whether, being settled on the
   tabernacle, it commanded them to rest, or, by its ascension, gave them
   the sign for removing the camp. Now, the equability of this proceeding,
   in all the variety of times and marches, did not a little conduce to
   certainty; for, if the cloud had daily accomplished the same course,
   this very regularity would have obscured the power' of God; but when
   for a whole year it did not move, and then frequently proceeded to a
   new place, and now by its. guidance pointed out a longer journey, now a
   shorter one, by this very diversity the paternal care of God, who was
   never unmindful of His people, more conspicuously manifested itself.

   Numbers 10

   Numbers 10:29-36

   29. And Moses said unto Hobab, the son of Raguel the Midianite, Moses'
   father-in-law, We are journeying unto the place of which the Lord said,
   I will give it you: come thou with us, and we will do thee good; for
   the Lord hath spoken good concerning Israel.

   29. Dixit autem Moses ad Hobab filium Reuel Madianitae soceri sui, Nos
   proficiscimur ad locum de quo dixit Jehova, Illum dabo vobis: veni
   nobiscum, et benefaciemus tibi: quia Jehova loquutus est beneficentiam
   super Israelem.

   30. And he said unto him, I will not go; but I will depart to mine own
   land, and to my kindred.

   30. Respondit autem ei, Non veniam: sed ad terram meam, et ad natale
   solum meum ibo.

   31. And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee; forasmuch as thou knowest
   how we are to encamp in the wilderness, and thou mayest be to us
   instead of eyes.

   31. Tunc dixit, Ne derelinquas nos: quia propterea nosti mansiones
   nostras in deserto, et fuisti nobis pro oculis.

   32. And it shall be, if thou go with us, yea, it shall be, that what
   goodness the Lord shall do unto us, the same will we do unto thee.

   32. Quum autem veneris nobiscum, et evenerit nobis bonum illud quod
   benefacturus est Jehova nobis, tum benefaciemus tibi.

   33. And they departed from the mount of the Lord three days' journey:
   and the ark of the covenant of the Lord went before them in the three
   days' journey, to search out a resting-place for them.

   33. Profecti sunt itaque a monte Jehovae via trium dierum: et arca
   foederis Jehovae proficiscebatur ante eos via trium dierum illorum, ad
   explorandam illis requiem.

   34. And the cloud of the Lord was upon them by day, when they went out
   of the camp.

   34. Et nubes Jehovae erat super eos interdiu, dum proficiscerentur e
   castris.

   35. And it came to pass, when the ark set forward, that Moses said,
   Rise up, Lord, and let thine enemies be scattered; and let them that
   hate thee flee before thee.

   35. Quum autem coepit proficisci arca, dicebat Moses, Surge Jehova, et
   despergantur inimici tui, et fugiant odio habentes te a facie tua:

   36. And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord, unto the many
   thousands of Israel.

   36. Quando vero requiescebat, dicebat, Revertere Jehova ad decem millia
   millium Israelis.

   29. And Moses said unto Hobab the son of Raguel. Very grossly are those
   mistaken who have supposed Hobab [7] to be Jethro, the father-in-law of
   Moses, whom we have already seen to have returned a few days after he
   had come to see him. Now, old age almost in a state of decrepitude
   would have been but little suited for, or equal to, such difficult
   labors. Moses was now eighty years old, and still far short of the age
   of his father-in-law. But all doubt is removed by the fourth chapter of
   Judges, where we read that the descendants of Hobab were still
   surviving in the land of Canaan. When, therefore, the good old man went
   home, he left Hobab his son -- still in the vigor of life, and to whom
   on account of his neighborhood, the desert-country was well known -- as
   a companion for his son-in-law, that might be useful to him in the
   performance of many services. Here, however, whether wearied by delay
   and difficulties, or offended by the malignant and perverse spirit of
   the people, or preferring his home and a stationary life to those
   protracted wanderings, he desired to follow his father. In order,
   however, that we might know that he had not sought his dismissal as a
   mere feint, (as is often the case,) [8] Moses expressly states that he
   could not immediately prevail upon him to stay by his prayers; nay,
   that he was not attracted by the promises whereby Moses endeavored to
   tempt him, until he had been perseveringly entreated. Although the
   expectation of the promised land is set before him, yet, since mention
   is only made of temporal and transient prosperity, it may thence be
   probably conjectured that he had not profited by his advantages as he
   should. He had seen and heard the tokens of God's awful power when the
   Law was given; yet Moses urges him to come on by no other argument than
   that he would enjoy the riches of the land. Unless perhaps Moses
   desired to give him some taste of the graciousness and fatherly love of
   God as manifested in the temporal blessing, in order to lift up his
   mind to higher things. Still he merely refers to the promise of God,
   and then engages that he shall share in all their good things.
   Nevertheless, this alone is no trifle, that he should be attracted by
   no uncertain hope, but by the sure enjoyment of those good things which
   God, who cannot lie, had promised: for deceptive allurements often
   invite men to undergo labors, and to encounter perils; but Moses brings
   forward God, as it were, as his surety, inasmuch as tie had promised
   that He would give the people a fertile land, full of an abundance of
   all good things. At any rate, Hobab represents to us, as in a mirror,
   the innate disposition of the whole human race, to long for that which
   it apprehends by the carnal sense. It is natural to prefer our country,
   however barren and wretched, to other lands the most fertile and
   delightful: thus the Ithaca of Ulysses has passed into a proverb. [9]
   But let me now reprove another fault, viz., that, generally speaking,
   all set their affections on this present life: thus Hobab despises the
   promise of God, and holds fast to the love of his native land.

   31. And he said, Leave us not, I pray thee. Moses perseveres and urges
   what he had just said, that Hobab should be a sharer in the prosperity
   which God had given his people reason to expect. "To this end" (he
   says) "thou hast known all our stations in the desert," which words
   commentators do not appear to have observed or understood; for they
   translate them simply, "for thou hast known," as if Moses desired to
   retain Hobab to be of use to himself, whereas there is more than one
   causal particle here; [10] and thus it is literally, "Since, for this
   cause, thou hast known all our resting-places," etc. Its meaning, then,
   is as follows, that Hobab was ill-advised for his own interest; for he
   had borne many inconveniences, for this reason, that he might at sonic
   time or other receive his recompense; as if it were said, Wherefore
   hast thou hitherto endured so many inconveniences whilst directing our
   course, unless that thou mightest enjoy with us the blessings of our
   repose? In a word, Moses signifies that the labors of Hobab would be
   vain and fruitless, unless he should endure them a little while longer,
   until, together with the children of Israel, he should enjoy the
   promised inheritance. What is here said, then, does not relate to the
   future, as if Moses had said, Be to us instead of eyes, as thou hast
   been heretofore; but by reminding him that the reward of his labors was
   at hand, he urges and encourages him to proceed.

   33. And they departed from the mount of the Lord. He calls Sinai "the
   mount of the Lord," because in no other place had God's glory been so
   conspicuously manifested. This, I admit, it had been called by
   anticipation (kata prolepsin) before the promulgation of the law; but
   this name was imposed upon it afterwards to inspire eternal reverence
   for the law. By "three days' journey," we must understand a continuous
   march of three days, for they did not pitch their tents until they
   reached the desert of Paran, but slept in the. open air. When it is
   said that the ark went before them in the three days' journey, there is
   no reference to its distance, as if it was sent forward three days
   ahead; but that it was so placed in their van that, when the cloud
   settled upon it, they halted as at a station prescribed to them by God.
   This was the searching for a resting-place of which he speaks.

   35. And it came to pass, when the ark set forward. Since their journey
   was by no means a peaceful one, but the attack of enemies was
   constantly to be dreaded, it was needful to beseech God that He would
   go forth as if prepared for battle. Thus, too, did Moses support their
   courage, lest any more immediate cause for terror should render them
   sluggish and inert. It is, then, as if he had prayed thus: O Lord, not
   only show us the way, but open it to us also by the power of thy hand
   in the destruction of the enemies. He calls them not the enemies of the
   people but of God, in order that the Israelites might be assured that
   they fought under His auspices; for thus might both a more certain
   victory be expected, since the righteous God, who avenges iniquity, was
   defending His own cause; and also, it was no slight matter of
   consolation and rejoicing, when the people heard, that whosoever should
   arise to harass them unjustly were also the enemies of God, since He
   will protect his people as the apple of His eye. Therefore has the
   Prophet borrowed this passage, in order to arm the Church with
   confidence, and to maintain it in cheerfulness under the violent
   assaults of its enemies. (Psalm 68:1.) Further, the analogy and
   similitude between the visible sign, and the thing signified, must be
   observed; for Moses was not so foolish as to address the Ark in these
   words; he only asked God to prove effectually that the Ark was a lively
   image of His power and glory.

   36. And when it rested, he said, Return, O Lord. By thus praying he
   also exhorts the people to be patient, lest the weariness which arose
   from the delay should beget indignation. Otherwise it would have been
   annoying that the time of their journeying should be protracted, so
   that they would arrive the later at their rest. And we see, indeed, how
   their minds were exasperated, as if a slower progress was a kind of
   disappointment. In order, therefore, to correct this impatience, Moses
   reminds them that their halts were advantageous to them, so that God,
   dwelling at home like the father of a family, might manifest His care
   of them; for the allusion is to men who Lake advantage of a time of
   repose and release from other business, to occupy themselves more
   un-restrainedly in paying attention to their own family.

   Numbers 11

   Numbers 11:1-35

   1. And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord: and the Lord
   heard it; and his anger was kindled; and the fire of the Lord burnt
   among them, and consumed them that were in the uttermost parts of the
   camp.

   1. Et fuit populus quasi fatiscentes, displicuit in auribus Jehovae.
   Audivit enim Jehova, et iratus est furor ejus, exarsitque ignis ipsius
   contra eos, consumpsitque extremum castrorum.

   2. And the people cried unto Moses; and when Moses prayed unto the
   Lord, the fire was quenched.

   2. Tunc clamavit populus ad Mosen, et oravit Moses Jehovam, et concidit
   ignis.

   3. And he called the name of the place Taberah; because the fire of the
   Lord burnt among them.

   3. Vocavitque nomen illius loci Taberah: quia accensus fuerat in eos
   ignis Jehovae.

   4. And the mixed multitude that was among them fell a lusting; and the
   children of Israel also wept again, and said, Who shall give us flesh
   to eat?

   4. Et collectio quae erat in medio ejus, concupiverunt concupiscentia,
   et aversi sunt: quinetiam fleverunt filii Israel, dicentes, Quis pascet
   nos carnibus?

   5. We remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt freely; the
   cucumbers, and the melons, and the leeks, and the onions, and the
   garlic:

   5. Recordamur piscium quos comedebamus in AEgypto gratis, cucumerum, et
   peponum, et porrorum, et ceparum et alliorum.

   6. But now our soul is dried away: there is nothing at all, beside this
   manna, before our eyes.

   6. At nunc anima nostra arida est, nec quicquam est nisi man in oculis
   nostris.

   7. And the manna was as coriander seed, and the color thereof as the
   color of bdellium.

   7. Man autem sicut coriandri semen erat, et color ejus sicut color
   bdellii.

   8. And the people went about, and gathered it, and ground it in mills,
   or beat it in a mortar, and baked it in pans, and made cakes of it: and
   the taste of it was as the taste of fresh oil.

   8. Diffundebant autem se populus, et colligebant, et molebant in mola
   aut terebant in mortario, coquebantque in olla, faciebantque ex eo
   placentas, quarum sapor erat sicut sapor recentis olei:

   9. And when the dew fell upon the camp in the night, the manna fell
   upon it.

   9. Quum vero descenderat ros super castra, descendebat man super ipsum.

   10. Then Moses heard the people weep throughout their families, every
   man in the door of his tent: and the anger of the Lord was kindled
   greatly; Moses was also displeased.

   10. Audivit itaque Moses populum flentem per familias: quemque ad
   ostium tabernaculi sui: unde iratus est furor Jehovae valde, ipsi
   quoque Mosi displicuit.

   11. And Moses said unto the Lord, Wherefore hast thou afflicted thy
   servant? and wherefore have I not found favor in thy sight, that thou
   layest the burden of all this people upon me?

   11. Et dixit Moses ad Jehovam, Ut quid malefecisti servo tuo? et quare
   non inveni gratiam in oculis tuis, ut imponeres onus universi populi
   hujus super me?

   12. Have I conceived all this people? have I begotten them, that thou
   shouldest say unto me, Carry them in thy bosom (as a nursing-father
   beareth the sucking child) unto the land which thou sworest unto their
   fathers?

   12. An ego concepi universum populum istum? et an ego genui eum, quod
   dicis mihi, Porta eum in sinu tuo, quemadmodum ferre solet nutritius
   infantem, in terram de qua jurasti patribus ejus?

   13. Whence should I have flesh to give unto all this people? for they
   weep unto me, saying, Give us flesh, that we may eat.

   13. Unde mihi caro ut dem universo populo huic? Flent enim adversum me,
   dicendo, Da nobis carnes, ut comedamus.

   14. I am not able to bear all this people alone, because it is too
   heavy for me.

   14. Non possem ego solus ferre universum populum hunc: quia supra vires
   meas est.

   15. And if thou deal thus with me, kill me, I pray thee, out of hand;
   if I have found favor in thy sight; and let me not see my wretchedness.

   15. Quod si ita tu facis mihi, occide me quaeso occidendo, si inveni
   gratiam in oculis tuis, et ne videam malum meum.

   16. And the Lord said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men of the
   elders of Israel, whom thou knowest to be the elders of the people, and
   officers over them; and bring them unto the tabernacle of the
   congregation, that they may stand there with thee.

   16. Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Congrega mihi septuaginta viros e
   senioribus conventionis, ut adstent ibi tecum.

   17. And I will come down and talk with thee there: and I will take of
   the spirit which is upon thee, and will put it upon them; and they
   shall bear the burden of the people with thee, that thou bear it not
   thyself alone.

   17. Tunc descendam, et loquar tecum ibi, et separabo de spiritu qui est
   in te, et ponam in eis: ut sustineant tecum onus populi: et non
   sustineas tu solus.

   18. And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves against tomorrow,
   and ye shall eat flesh: (for ye have wept in the ears of the Lord,
   saying, Who shall give us flesh to eat? for it was well with us in
   Egypt;) therefore the Lord will give you flesh, and ye shall eat.

   18. Ad populum autem dices, Sanctificamini in crastinum, et comedetis
   carnes: flevistis enim in auribus Jehovae, dicendo, Quiscomedere faciet
   nos carnes? certe melius erat nobis in AEgypto: dedit enim Jehova vobis
   carnes, et comedetis.

   19. Ye shall not eat one day, nor two days, nor five days, neither ten
   days, nor twenty days:

   19. Non una die comedetis, neque duobus diebus, neque quinque diebus,
   neque decem diebus, neque viginti diebus tantum:

   20. But even a whole month, until it come out at your nostrils, and it
   be loathsome unto you: because that ye have despised the Lord which is
   among you, and have wept before him, saying, Why came we forth out of
   Egypt?

   20. Sed usque ad mensem dierum, donec egrediatur e naribus vestris, et
   sit vobis in abominationem: propterea quod contempsistis Jehovam, qui
   est in medio vestri, et flevistis coram eo, dicendo, Ut quid egressi
   sumus ex AEgypto?

   21. And Moses said, The people, among whom I am, are six hundred
   thousand footmen; and thou hast said, I will give them flesh, that they
   may eat a whole month.

   21. Et dixit Moses, Sexcentorum millium peditum est populus in cujus
   medio ego sum: et tu dicis, Carnem dabo eis: et comedent mensem dierum.

   22. Shall the flocks and the herds be slain for them, to suffice them?
   or shall all the fish of the sea be gathered together for them, to
   suffice them?

   22. Nunquid oves et boves ingulabuntur eis, et sufficient illis? an
   omnes pisces maris congregabuntur illis, et sufficient eis?

   23. And the Lord said unto Moses, Is the Lord's hand waxed short? Thou
   shalt see now whether my word shall come to pass unto thee, or not.

   23. Tum dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Nunquid manus Jehovae abbreviabitur?
   Nunc videbis utrum eveniat tibi verbum meum, annon.

   24. And Moses went out, and told the people the words of the Lord, and
   gathered the seventy men of the elders of the people, and set them
   round about the tabernacle.

   24. Egressus est autem Moses, et retulit ad populum verba Jehovae:
   congregavitque septuaginta viros e senioribus populi, quos statuit in
   circuitu tabernaculi.

   25. And the Lord came down in a cloud, and spoke unto him, and took of
   the spirit that was upon him, and gave it unto the seventy elders: and
   it came to pass, that, when the spirit rested upon them, they
   prophesied, red did not cease.

   25. Tunc descendit Jehova in nube, et loquutus est ad eum: et seorsum
   accepit de Spiritu qui erat super eum, posuitque super septuaginta
   viros seniores: et fuit ut requiescente in eis Spiritu prophetaverint:
   et non addiderunt.

   26. But there remained two of the men in the camp, the name of the one
   was Eldad, and the name of the other Medad: and the spirit rested Upon
   them, (and they were of them that were written, but went not out unto
   the tabernacle,) and they prophesied in the camp.

   26. Remanserunt autem duo viri in castris, nomen unius Eldad, et nomen
   alterius Medad: super quos etiam requievit Spiritus (erant vero inter
   scriptos, sed non egressi fuerant ad tabernaculum) et prophetare
   eoeperunt in castris.

   27. And there ran a young man, and told Moses, and said, Eldad and
   Medad do prophesy in the camp.

   27. Et cucurrit puer quidam, et nuntiavit Mosi, dixitque: Eldad et
   Medad prophetant in castris.

   28. And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses, one of his young
   men, answered and said, My lord Moses, forbid them.

   28. Tunc respondit Jehosua filius Nun minister Mosis ex juvenibus ejus,
   et dixit, Domine mi Moses probibe eos.

   29. And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? Would God that
   all the Lord's people were prophets, and that the Lord would put his
   Spirit upon them!

   29. Cut respondit Moses, Nunquid aemularis tu propter me? et utinam
   universus populus Jehovae prophetae essent! atque ut daret Jehova
   Spiritum suum super eos.

   30. And Moses gat him into the camp, he and the elders of Israel.

   30. Recepit autem se Moses ad castra, ipse et seniores Israel.

   31. And there went forth a wind from the Lord, and brought quails from
   the sea, and let them fall by the camp, as it were a day's journey on
   this side, and as it were a day's journey on the other side, round
   about the camp, and as it were two cubits high upon the face of the
   earth.

   31. Et ventus egressus est a Jehova, adduxitque coturnices e mari, et
   demisit ad castra: quasi itinere diei hinc, et itinere diei illinc, per
   circuitum castrorum, et fere ad duos cubitos per faciem terrae.

   32. And the people stood up all that day, and all that night, and all
   the next day, and they gathered the quails: he that gathered least
   gathered ten homers; and they spread them all abroad for themselves
   round about the camp.

   32. Tunc surrexit populus toto die illo, et tota nocte, totoque die
   sequenti, et collegerunt sibi coturnices: qui pauciores collegit,
   collegit decem cumulos: et expanderunt sibi expandendo per circuitus
   castrorum.

   33. And while the flesh was yet between their teeth, ere it was chewed,
   the wrath of the Lord was kin-died against the people; and the Lord
   smote the people with a very great plague.

   33. Caro adhuc erat inter dentes eorum antequam concisa esset: tum
   furor Jehovae exarsit in populum, percussitque Jehova populum plaga
   magna admodum.

   34. And he called the name of that place Kibroth. hattaavah: because
   there they buried the people that lusted.

   34. Et vocatum est nomen loci illius Cibroth-hathaavah: quia ibi
   sepelierunt populum concupiscentem.

   35. And the people journeyed from Kibroth-hattaavah unto Hazeroth; and
   abode at Hazeroth.

   35. De Cibroth-hathaavah profecti sunt populus in Haseroth, et
   substiterunt in eo loco.

   1. And when the people complained, it displeased the Lord. [11] The
   ambiguous signification of the participle [12] causes the translators
   to twist this passage into a variety of meanings. Since the Hebrew root
   'vn, aven, is sometimes trouble and labor, sometimes fatigue, sometimes
   iniquity, sometimes falsehood, some translate it, "The people were, as
   it were, complaining or murmuring." Others (though this seems to be
   more beside the mark) insert the adverb unjustly; as if Moses said,
   that their complaint was unjust, when they expostulated with God.
   Others render it, "being sick, (nauseantes,") but this savors too much
   of affectation; others, "lying, or dealing treacherously." Some derive
   it from the root tv'nh, thonah, and thus explain it, "seeking
   occasion," which I reject as far fetched. To me the word fainting
   (fatiscendi) seems to suit best; for they failed, as if broken down
   with weariness. It is probable that no other crime is alleged against
   them than that, abandoning the desire to proceed, they fell into
   supineness and inactivity, which was to turn their back upon God, and
   repudiate the promised inheritance. This sense will suit very well, and
   thus the proper meaning of the word will be retained. Thus, Ezekiel
   calls by the name t'nym, theunim, those fatigues, whereby men destroy
   and overwhelm themselves through undertaking too much work. Still, I do
   not deny that, when they lay in a state of despondency, they uttered
   words of reproach against God; especially since Moses says that this
   displeased the ears of God, and not His eyes; yet the origin of the
   evil was, as I have stated, that they fainted with weariness, so as to
   refuse to follow God any further.

   And the Lord heard it. He more plainly declares that the people broke
   forth into open complaints; and it is probable that they even east
   reproaches upon God, as we infer from the heaviness of this punishment.
   Although some understand the word fire metaphorically for vengeance, it
   is more correct to take it simply according to the natural meaning of
   the word, i.e., that a part of the camp burnt with a conflagration sent
   from God. Still a question arises, what was that part or extremity of
   the camp which the fire seized upon? for some think that the punishment
   began with the leaders themselves, whose crime was the more atrocious.
   Others suppose that the fire raged among the common people, from the
   midst of whom the murmuring arose. But I rather conjecture, as in a
   matter of uncertainty, that God kindled the fire in some extreme part,
   so as to awaken their terror, in order that there might be room for
   pardon; since it is presently added, that tie was content with the
   punishment of a few. It must, however, be remarked, that because the
   people were conscious of their sin, the door was shut against their
   prayers. Hence it is, that they cry to Moses rather than to God; and we
   may infer that, being devoid of repentance and faith, they dreaded to
   look upon God. This is the reward of a bad conscience, to seek for rest
   in our disquietude, and still to fly from God, who alone can allay our
   trouble and alarm. From the fact that God is appeased at the
   intercession of Moses, we gather that temporal punishment is often
   remitted to the wicked, although they still remain exposed to the
   judgment of God. When he says that the fire of the Lord was sunk down,
   [13] for this is the proper signification of the word sq, shakang, he
   designates the way in which it was put out, and in which God's mercy
   openly manifested itself; as also, on the other hand. it is called the
   fire of God, as having been plainly kindled by Him, lest any should
   suppose that it was an accidental conflagration. A name also was
   imposed on the place, which might be a memorial to posterity both of
   the crime and its punishment; for Tabera is a burning, or combustion.

   4. And the mixed multitude that was among them. A new murmuring of the
   people is here recorded: for we gather from many circumstances that
   this relation is different from that which precedes: although, as evil
   begets evil, it is probable that after they had begun to be affected by
   the disease of impatience, they spitefully invented grounds for
   increased tedium and annoyance. Yet there was something monstrous in
   this madness, that, when they had just been so severely chastised, and
   part of' the camp was even yet almost smoking, and when God was hardly
   appeased, they should have given way to the indulgence of lust, whereby
   they brought upon themselves a still more severe punishment.
   Unquestionably, when they again provoked God by their iniquity, the
   remains of the fire were still before their eyes; whence it appears how
   greatly they were blinded by their obstinate wickedness. He states,
   indeed, that the murmuring first began among the strangers, or mixed
   multitude, who had mingled themselves with the Israelites, as we have
   seen elsewhere; but he adds that the whole people also were led into
   imitation of their ungodly complainings. Hence we are taught, that the
   wicked and sinful should be avoided, lest they should corrupt us by
   their bad example; since the contagion of vice easily spreads. At the
   same time also, we are warned, that it does not at all avail to excuse
   us, that others are the instigators of our sin; since it by no means
   profited the Israelites, that they fell through the influence of
   others, inasmuch as it was their own lust; which carried them away. In
   the first place, therefore, we must beware that our corrupt desires do
   not tempt us, and we must put a restraint upon ourselves; and then that
   the profane despisers of God do not add fuel to the fire.

   A question here occurs, whether it is sinful to long for flesh; for if
   so, all our appetites must. likewise be condemned. I answer, that God
   was not wroth because the desire of flesh affected the Israelites; but,
   first, their disobedience displeased Him, because they longed to eat;
   flesh, as it were, against His will, when He would have them content
   with the manna alone; and then their intemperance and violent passion.
   For this reason Moses says that they "lusted a lust," [14] indicating
   that they abandoned all self-control, so as to go beyond all bounds. In
   the third place, their ingratitude displeased Him, which is here
   adverted to, but openly condemned in the Psalm, where the Prophet
   reproves them, for that God "had commanded the clouds from above, and
   opened the doors of heaven," so as to supply them with the "corn of
   heaven," and the bread "of angels," (Psalm 78:23-25;) and yet, even so
   they were not restrained from despising so excellent a benefit, and
   abandoning themselves to lawless intemperance. The rule of moderation,
   and of a sober and frugal life, which Paul prescribes, is well known;
   that we should

   "know both how to be full and to be hungry, both to abound and to
   suffer need." (Philippians 4:12.)

   Well known, too, is his admonition, that we should

   "make not provision for the flesh, to fulfil the lusts thereof."
   (Romans 13:14.)

   All improper longing is, therefore, to be repressed, so that we should
   desire nothing which is not lawful; and, secondly, that our appetites
   should not be excessive. Hence, when he refers elsewhere to this
   occurrence, (1 Corinthians 10:6,)he warns us to fear the judgment of
   God; "to the intent we should not lust after evil things," thus
   distinguishing wild and uncontrolled appetites from such as are
   moderate and well regulated.

   When they ask, "Who shall give us flesh to eat?" they seek to have it
   elsewhere than from God, who abundantly supplied them with food, though
   it was of a different kind. We see, then, that they rebelled with a
   brutal and blind impetuosity; for necessity was laid upon them by God,
   that they should eat nothing but manna; against this they struggled
   like fierce and stubborn beasts, as if they would make God the servant
   of their lust.

   5. We remember the fish which we did eat in Egypt. By this comparison
   with the former mode of living, they depreciate the present grace of
   God: and yet they enumerate no delicacies, when they speak of leeks,
   and onions, and garlic. Some, therefore, thus explain it, When such
   great abundance and variety was commonly to be met with, how painful
   and grievous must it be to us to be deprived of greater delicacies! My
   own opinion is, that these lowly people, who had been used to live on
   humble fare, praised their accustomed food, as if they had been the
   greatest luxuries. Surely rustics and artisans value as much their pork
   and beef, their cheese and curds, their onions and cabbage, as most of
   the rich do their sumptuous fare. Scornfully, therefore, do the
   Israelites magnify things which, in themselves, are but of little
   value, in order the more to stimulate their depraved appetite, already
   sufficiently excited. Still there is no doubt but that those who had
   been accustomed to a diet of herbs and fish, would think themselves
   happy with that kind of food. Moreover, to make the matter more
   invidious, they say in general, that they ate gratis [15] of that,
   which cost them but little: although such a phrase is common in all
   languages. For even profane writers testify that all that sea-shore
   abounds with fish. [16] The fisheries of the Nile also are very
   productive, and a part: of the wealth of Egypt: whilst the country is
   so well watered, that it produces abundance of vegetables and fruits.
   [17]

   6. But now our soul is dried away. They complain that they are almost
   wasted away with famine and hunger, whilst they are abundantly supplied
   with manna; in the same way as they had just been loudly declaring that
   they had lived in Egypt for a very little money; as if they were
   affected by a great dearth of provisions, when, by the pure liberality
   of God, a kind of food was provided for them, more easy to prepare than
   any other, and so actually prepared without trouble or cost. But such
   is the malignity and ingratitude of men, that they count all God's
   bounty for nothing, whilst they are brooding over their own importunate
   lusts. Many in their gluttony consume, and bring to naught whatever God
   bestows upon them: others, in their avarice, dry up the fountain of His
   liberality, which else would be inexhaustible. But these, in the midst
   of their abundance, say that they are dry, because insatiable cupidity
   inflames them, so that God's blessing, however ample, cannot satisfy
   them. Thus the rain, washing the hard rock, wets it not within, neither
   tempers its dryness by its moisture. Since, therefore, a contempt of
   God's blessings withers them all, like a hot blast, let us learn to
   assign them their due honor, that they may be supplied to us in
   sufficiency. Thus will be fulfilled in our ease:

   "The righteous shall flourish like the palm-tree: he shall grow like a
   cedar in Lebanon. Those that be planted in the house of the Lord shall
   flourish in the courts of our God. They shall still bring forth fruit
   in old age; they shall be fat and flourishing."
   (Psalm 92:12-14.)

   For Scripture does not so often declare in vain that God satisfies the
   longing souls, and filleth the hungry with food. They complain that
   there is nothing before their eyes but manna: as if their loathing of
   this one excellent and abundant kind of food was actual famine.

   7. And the manna was as coriander seed. Moses had already adverted to
   this in Exodus 16; [18] but he now repeats it, in order more fully to
   condemn their perverse desire; for what could be more unseemly and
   intolerable than thus to eschew a food delightful both in appearance
   and taste v. For the same reason the Prophet, in Psalm 78, records that
   men were not satisfied with "angels' food," and "corn from heaven."
   Here, instead of saying that it was white, he calls it the color of
   Bedola, [19] a precious stone, whether a pearl, or some other kind. Its
   very appearance, then, was calculated to give them pleasure; and, since
   without much labor, either by grinding or crushing it, they might make
   it into various sorts of food, and all of a sweet and pleasant taste;.
   the baser was their ingratitude in complaining, as if God treated them
   with but little liberality as to their food.

   10. Then Moses heard the people weep. Wonderful indeed, and almost
   prodigious was the madness of the people, thus all of them to mourn as
   if reduced to the extremity of despair. What would they have done in
   actual famine? what if they had to gnaw bitter roots, almost without
   any juice in them? What if they had had to live on tasteless and
   unwholesome bread? We see, therefore, how by the indulgence of their
   depraved lusts men make themselves wretched in the very midst of
   prosperity. Let us, then, learn to bridle our excessive passions, that
   we may not bring upon ourselves troubles and inconveniences, and all
   sorts of painful feelings; for if the cause be duly weighed, when men
   afflict themselves with sorrow and lamentation, we shall generally find
   that, whereas the evil might be lightened by endurance, its pain is
   increased by preposterous imaginations. But here a gross instance of
   luxury is set before us, when, in their satiety, they weep as if long
   abstinence threatened them with death. It was an effect of holy and
   praiseworthy zeal, that this great perverseness should displease Moses;
   but he was not without error in carrying it to excess; for he unjustly
   expostulates with God, complaining that He had laid too heavy a burden
   upon him, when tie knew all the time that he was sustained by His
   power. His charge was indeed difficult and laborious; but in that he
   had experienced God's wondrous aid, whenever he had groaned beneath his
   burden, there was no room for complaint; besides, since he had been
   dignified by a peculiar honor, it was ungrateful to brand with disgrace
   the good gift of God. He reputes it his greatest evil that the charge
   of governing the people had been intrusted to him; whereas all his
   senses ought rather to have been ravished with astonishment, that God
   had condescended to choose him to be the redeemer of His people, and
   the minister of His wondrous power. This, too, was very inconsiderate,
   to ask whether he had begotten or brought forth the people; as if his
   calling by God did not lay him sufficiently under obligation, or as if
   there were no other ties than those of nature. God, indeed, has
   inspired parents with such love towards their offspring, that they
   willingly undergo incredible troubles on their account; but Moses was
   bound by another kind of piety, for by God's command he was father of
   the people. Wherefore he ought not to have only regarded nature, but
   the obligation of his office also.

   13. Whence should I have flesh to give to all this people? Justly,
   indeed, does he accuse the people, and deny that he is possessed of
   flesh wherewith to satisfy so great a multitude; but he is wrong in
   expostulating with God, as if he were burdened beyond his strength;
   for, since God knew that he was unequal to so many difficulties, He
   supported him by the influence of His Spirit. But he sinned most
   grossly in the conclusion of his complaint, requesting God to kill him.
   In these words we see how far even the best of God's servants may be
   carried, when they give too great indulgence to their passions. For it
   is the longing of despair to seek that we may be removed from the
   world, so that death may bring our troubles to an end. Since the
   impetuosity of his grief hurried away Moses God's most chosen servant
   to this, what might not happen to us, if impatience should hold
   dominion over our hearts? Let us, then, learn to put a stop to this
   disease in good time.

   16. And the Lord said unto Moses, Gather unto me seventy men. God
   complies with the request of Moses, by associating with him seventy
   companions, by whose care and assistance he may be relieved from some
   part of his labor; yet not without some signs of indignation, for, by
   taking from him some portion of His Spirit to distribute amongst the
   others, He inflicts upon him that mark of disgrace which he deserved. I
   know that some [20] regard it differently, and think that nothing was
   taken away from Moses, but that the others were endued with new grace,
   such as Moses had been preeminent for possessing alone before. But,
   since the words expressly declare that God will make them partakers of
   that grace which He will take from Moses himself, I by no means admit
   the truth of this subtle exposition. The passage in Genesis 27:36 is
   quoted, in which it is said, "Hast thou not reserved a blessing for
   me?" but, when God expressly says, "I will separate [21] of the Spirit
   which is upon thee," there can be no question but that a diminution is
   indicated. For, as long as Moses alone was appointed to rule the
   people, he was so supplied with the necessary gifts of the Spirit, as
   that his ability should not be inferior to the greatness of the labor.
   God now promises that the others shall be his companions in such sort,
   as that He divides His gifts among them all. I have no doubt, then, but
   that this division comprehends punishment in it; and from hence we may
   gather a useful piece of instruction, viz., that the greater the
   difficulty is which God imposes upon any one, the greater is the
   liberality with which He treats him, in order that he may be sufficient
   for his charge. Thus it is in His power to work with equal efficiency
   by one man, as by a hundred, or a thousand; for He has no need of a
   multitude (of agents,) but, as He pleases, He executes His works
   sometimes without the aid of men, sometimes by their hands. In sum, God
   indirectly reproves the gross ingratitude of Moses, whereby he
   depreciated that marvelous grace which had hitherto shone forth in him;
   and He declares that he shall not be hereafter so great as he was, in
   regard to the excellency he derived from the Spirit; inasmuch as he had
   in a manner thrown away the gifts of the Spirit, by refusing to bear
   the trouble imposed upon him. Our modesty, indeed, is praiseworthy, if
   through consciousness of our own weakness we recoil from arduous
   charges; but it is too absurd for us to withdraw ourselves under this
   pretext from our duty, and, despising the calling of God, to shake off
   the yoke.

   The word Spirit is here, as frequently elsewhere, applied to the gifts
   themselves; as if He had said, I had deposited with thee gifts
   sufficing for the government of the people; but now, since thou
   refusest, I will distribute his due measure to each of the seventy, so
   that the grace of the Spirit, which dwelt in thee alone, shall be
   manifestly dispersed among many. It is now asked how Moses separated
   the seventy, whether according to his own judgment only, or by the
   election of the people. It is generally agreed that six were chosen
   from each tribe, and thus that they were seventy-two; but that for the
   sake of brevity two were omitted, as amongst the Romans, [22] they
   spoke of the Centumviri, although they were a hundred and five; for
   they appointed three for each of the thirty-five tribes. Since the
   opinion is probable, I leave it undecided; but at the same time I
   retain the conjecture which I have elsewhere made, [23] viz., that,
   since the race of Abraham had been increased in an incredible manner in
   two hundred and twenty years, lest so astonishing a miracle should ever
   be forgotten, the seventy were elected in accordance with the number of
   the fathers who had gone down into Egypt with Jacob. And, in fact, this
   seems to have been with them, as it were, a sacred number; as recalling
   to their memory that little band from which they had derived their
   origin. For, before the Law was promulgated, Moses was commanded to
   take with him seventy to accompany him to the mount, and to be
   eye-witnesses of God's glory. Meanwhile, I do not deny that there were
   two more than the number seventy; but I only point out why God fixed
   upon this number, viz., to equalize the leaders and heads of the people
   with the family of Jacob, which was the source of their race and name.
   In truth, from the fact that, when Hoses went up into Mount Sinai to
   receive the Tables from the hand of God, he took with him seventy
   officers, we infer that the number of those who should excel in honor,
   was already fixed at this, although the charge of governing, which is
   here spoken of, was not yet committed to them. And it is probable that
   these same persons who had been appointed leaders, were called to this
   new and unwonted office, as the words themselves imply. It is indeed
   certain, that when the Jews returned from the Babylonish captivity,
   because they were not permitted to appoint a king, they followed the
   example here set them in the establishment of their Sanhedrim; only
   this honor was paid to the memory of David and their rings, that from
   their race they chose their seventy rulers in whom the supreme power
   was vested. And this form of government continued down to Herod, [24]
   who abolished the whole council by which he had been condemned, and
   destroyed the lives of them all. Still, I think that he was not
   impelled to commit the massacre only out of vengeance, but also lest
   the dignity of the royal race should be an obstacle to his tyranny.

   It must, however, be observed that, although God promises new grace to
   the seventy men, he would not have them taken indiscriminately from the
   people in general, but expressly commands them to be chosen from the
   order of the elders, and heads of the people, being such as were
   already possessed of authority, and had given proofs of their diligence
   and virtue. Thus, also, now-a-days, when he calls both the pastors of
   the Church and magistrates to their office, although He furnishes them
   with new gifts, still He would not have them raised to their honorable
   stations promiscuously as they may come first, but chooses rather with
   reference to their spiritual endowments, wherewith He distinguishes,
   and commends those whom He has destined to any exalted office. In
   short, He commands the most fitting to be chosen; but, after they have
   been elected, tie promises that He will add what is wanting. For this
   reason He commands that they should station themselves at the door of
   the tabernacle, that He may there display His grace. Although I think
   that two other reasons were likewise taken into consideration, viz.,
   that they might know that the office was intrusted to them by God, and
   might always be mindful of the heavenly tribunal, before which they
   must be accountable: and also that they might be held in additional
   reverence by the very associations of the place, and that the people
   might submit to them as the ministers of God. Now, although God does
   not at present dwell in a visible tabernacle, yet are we reminded by
   this example that pastors and magistrates are not duly ordained, unless
   they are placed in the presence of God; nor rightly inaugurated in
   their offices, unless when they consecrate themselves to God Himself,
   and when His majesty, on the other hand, acquires their reverence.
   Cyprian [25] twists this passage further, but I know not whether on
   sufficiently firm grounds, to prove that bishops are not to be elected,
   except with the consent of the whole people.

   18. And say thou unto the people, Sanctify yourselves. This is another
   part of the answer, which is given respecting the matter in
   consideration, viz., that the people should prepare themselves to
   satiate their greediness. Although the word qds [26] kadesh, signifies
   to prepare, yet its literal meaning seems to be most appropriate here;
   I have therefore retained the word sanctify, which is, however, here
   used ironically, for Moses does not exhort: them to purge themselves
   from all defilement's, and piously and sincerely to receive the grace
   of God, but he chastises their profane and brutal gluttony. Others
   translate it simply, as if it were said, Whet your teeth, and make
   ready your bellies: but, in my judgment, there is a reproof implied,
   because they are polluted by a foul and wicked desire, so as to be
   incapable of receiving God's paternal favor: for "ye shall eat flesh"
   follows, "because your weeping and complaining has reached the ears of
   God;" by which words he signifies that by their importunate cries they
   had provoked God's anger, so that they should devour none but deadly
   food. And soon afterwards it is stated more clearly that by their
   insolence they had deserved to be destroyed by the bounty of God. For
   "a whole month," he says, ye shall gormandize, "till it come out of
   your nostrils, and it be loathsome unto you." Thus he compares them to
   those guttlers who so overwhelm themselves with gluttony, that they are
   obliged soon afterwards to vomit what they have eaten too greedily, or
   who abominate the taste of their superfluous luxuries, as if they were
   something filthy. This is what is meant by to "come out," or to be
   blown out, "at the nostrils." zr' [27] tzara, which we have translated
   abomination, properly means dispersion; but Moses indicates by it that
   they shall vomit, or spit it out, like something unfit to be swallowed.
   If any should object that it is said in Psalm 78:30, "They were not yet
   estranged from their lust:" this is easily solved by understanding that
   their unrestrained gluttony is there rebuked, [28] as if he called them
   guttlers (gurgites,) whom no abundance can suffice to satisfy.
   Therefore the Prophet says, that although they were bursting with
   excess, they were not satiated; but were so inflamed by their boundless
   voracity, that God's vengeance could alone repress it. But the reason
   alleged for this is especially to be observed, "because they had
   rejected God, who was in the midst of them." By these words, the excuse
   of error or inadvertency is barred; for if, for the purpose of proving
   their patience God had withdrawn His power, the terror which they
   conceived at His absence might, perhaps, have been excusable; but now,
   when they knew by sure experience that their means of subsistence were
   supplied by Him, they betray their deliberate wickedness by despising
   His present beneficence. For that God was in the midst of them is
   equivalent to His giving manifest tokens both of His infinite power and
   His paternal favor. These words show us that the more immediately God
   manifests His grace to us, the more inexcusable we are, if we disparage
   it when it is thus liberally offered to us. What follows might appear
   not to deserve severe reproof, viz., that they "wept before God;" but
   the enormity of the sin is specified directly afterwards, i.e. that
   they were vexed by their departure from Egypt: for this was not merely
   to repudiate the deliverance, which they had so greatly longed for, but
   to quarrel with God, because He had listened to their cry, and had
   condescended to redeem them from their wretched and lost estate.

   21. And Moses said, The people among whom I am, are six hundred
   thousand. Although Moses' object was right, yet he fell into unbelief,
   and thus stumbled at the very threshold. His pious solicitude indeed
   impelled him to doubt; because he feared that God's holy name would be
   exposed to derision and contumely, if he should send away empty those
   to whom he had promised food. But it seemed to him incredible that so
   mighty a multitude should be sufficiently supplied with flesh. When he
   calls them "six hundred thousand," he either does not calculate their
   numbers exactly, or indicates that some had died since their departure,
   when he had numbered the people. (Exodus 14.) Yet it is probable that
   he referred to the recent census, in which they were found to be
   603,550, (Numbers 1:46;) but for the sake of brevity he put the sum in
   the gross, as he does elsewhere, omitting the 3550. (Exodus 12:37.) By
   speaking of foot-men, he means the men, and thus excepts the women and.
   children. Assuredly such a multitude might astonish him, or, at any
   rate, might inspire him with alarm, so that he should mistrust the
   promise. His doubt, however, was wrong in two respects; first, because
   he did not simply trust, as if he were not assured that God was true in
   all His words; and, secondly, because he improperly allowed his mind to
   measure God's inestimable power by his own senses. Let us learn,
   therefore, that, as soon as God has spoken, we should embrace, without
   discussion, whatever has proceeded out of His mouth; and so likewise
   let us learn to humble ourselves, and our own minds, and at the same
   time to rise by faith above the world, and our natural reason; so that
   no absurdity, which the flesh may suggest to us, should prevent us from
   certainly concluding that whatever God has promised He will, by His
   might, perform. For it is a most incorrect calculation to bind down
   God's doings to ordinary standards; as if His power were not more
   extensive than our minds can reach. We must, therefore, carefully take
   notice of the rebuke, whereby God so corrected Moses at once, that it
   ought to prevent and to cure all diseases of distrust in us. For the
   immensity of God's hand convicts the folly of those who would subject
   it to their own imaginations and rules. For, even although God should
   not stretch forth His hand, He holds heaven and earth in its "hollow,"
   as it is said in Isaiah 40:12. What madness, then, is it to seek to
   grasp by our own senses, and, as it were, to imprison that hand which
   is greater than a hundred worlds! As soon, therefore, as distrust on
   the score of difficulties begins to take possession of our minds, let
   this conclusion be remembered, that the promises of God do not exceed
   the measure of His power to accomplish effectually whatever He has
   declared. This question, however, "Is the Lord's hand waxed short?" may
   be explained in two ways: for the old interpreter [29] has rendered it,
   "Is God's hand weak?" But God seems to adduce the proof, whereby He had
   borne witness to His power, not only in the creation of heaven and
   earth, but also in so many recent miracles; as if to rebuke the
   ingratitude of Moses, who had profited so little by these most striking
   lessons: for Isaiah uses the same word in this sense, where he says:
   "Behold, the Lord's hand is not shortened." (Isaiah 59:1.) Moses is
   unquestionably exalting the blessings received on former occasions,
   wherein the people had experienced the saving power of God. I have
   retained the future tense of the verb, [30] since it does not injure
   the sense. What is said amounts to this, Will God's hand be weaker than
   usual, so as not to put forth its power already known?

   24. And Moses went out and told the people the words. We here see how
   greatly Moses profited by his brief rebuke, for he now actively sets
   about what he was commanded. Doubt had given him a check, so that he
   stopped in the middle of his course; whereas he now testifies by the
   promptitude of his obedience that his distrust is overcome. For just as
   unbelief discourages men, so that they sink down into inactivity, so
   faith inspires both body and mind with rigor for the effectual
   discharge of their duties.

   Although the narrative does not expressly state that he spoke to them
   respecting the flesh, it declares in general terms that he omitted
   nothing; and, indeed, it would have been very inappropriate to speak
   only of the Seventy Elders, when the origin of all the evil had been
   the craving for flesh. Briefly stating, then, that he had reported the
   commands of God to the people, he includes both parts of the matter,
   the second of which he then follows up. And, first, he says that the
   elders were called to the Tabernacle, that they might there be
   appointed rulers and officers. When be states that they were "set round
   about," I do not interpret the words so precisely as to suppose that
   eighteen were ranged on each side, and, of the rest, half were placed
   before the court, and half behind the Tabernacle; but that they were so
   arranged, as to surround some part of the Tabernacle. Now, this was
   equivalent to their being set before God, so that they might hereafter
   exercise their office with more authority, as being sent by Him; and at
   the same time that they might devote themselves to God, and dedicate
   themselves to His service; and also, that being invested with the
   necessary endowments, they might bear the tokens of their calling. For
   this reason, it is soon afterwards added, that enough of the spirit of
   Moses was given them for the discharge of their official duties; for,
   although Moses by God's command had chosen men of approved virtue and
   experience, yet He would have them prepared anew, in order that their
   call might be effectual. When they are said to have "prophesied," this
   was a visible sign of the gift of the Spirit, which, nevertheless, had
   reference to a different object; for they were not appointed to be.
   prophets, though God would testify by this outward mark that they were
   new men, in order that the people might receive them with greater
   reverence. In my opinion, however, prophecy here is equivalent to a
   special faculty of discoursing magnificently of secret things or
   mysteries. We know that poets were called prophets by profane writers,
   [31] because poetry itself savors of inspiration (enthousiasmon); in
   the same way that extraordinary ability, [32] in which the afflatus of
   the Spirit shone forth, obtained the name of prophecy. Thus, the gift
   of prophecy in Saul was a kind of mark of royalty; so that he might not
   ascend the throne without credentials. (1 Samuel 10:10.) Thus, then,
   this Spirit of Prophecy was only accorded to these persons for a short
   time; since it was sufficient that they should be once marked out by
   God: for so I understand what Moses says afterwards, "and they added
   not." [33] it is too forced an interpretation to refer it, as some do,
   to the past. I confess, indeed, that they were not previously prophets;
   but I have no doubt but that Moses here indicates that the gift was a
   temporary one: as we are also told in the case of Saul: for, as soon as
   this token of God's grace had manifested itself in him, [34] he ceased
   to prophesy. The meaning, therefore, is that their call was thus
   substantiated for a short period, so that this unusual circumstance
   should awaken the more admiration.

   26. But there remained two of the men in the camp. It is not certain
   why they had not appeared amongst the others. I do not at all doubt but
   that they were called for by Moses; nor would they have been endued
   with the same grace of the Spirit as the others, if through idleness or
   contempt they had not come at the time appointed. We may, therefore,
   probably infer that they did not actually receive the invitation,
   because they could not be found; and hence it arose that God excused
   their ignorance. Still, however, it must be observed that they were
   kept back by the secret counsel of God, that His grace might be made
   known by this illustrious proof amongst the common people in general,
   when they were not all eye-witnesses of it: for the greater portion of
   them had not assembled at the Tabernacle. In order, therefore, that its
   fame might spread more widely, and might reach even to the most lowly,
   God chose that this new and extraordinary gift of His Spirit should be
   conspicuous in the midst of the camp, lest any of the dullest and
   grossest among them should pretend to be ignorant of it. In fact, it is
   plain that they were all aroused by the miracle; for the "young man,"
   who is spoken of, would not have run to bear the incredible news to
   Moses, unless struck by the novelty of the case.

   28. And Joshua the son of Nun, the servant of Moses. It is obvious that
   this foolish and preposterous jealousy arose from a good source. Joshua
   saw that Moses was so preeminent above all others, as to be justly
   deemed, after God, the head of the people; he feared, therefore, lest,
   if any portion of his superiority should be withdrawn, the grace of God
   would be dispelled and lost. We know, too, that almost every change is
   injurious, and apt to give a shock to public affairs. In asserting,
   then, the rights of Moses, he desired, as far as he could, to consult
   the welfare of all; but the excess of his zeal had some alloy in it, in
   consequence of the immoderate affection and love which he bore to
   Moses; just as it often happens to ourselves, that although our desires
   have a right object, they still go astray into erroneous feelings. So,
   then, let us learn to revere the most illustrious servants of Christ,
   as that God alone should be supreme; and that He, who is far above all,
   should still maintain His pre-eminence. And this will be the case, if
   we hold fast to the principle, that although "there are diversities of
   gifts," yet there is but one Spirit from whom they flow; and although
   there are "differences of administrations," yet but one Lord who must
   be served, (1 Corinthians 12:4, 5;) which also Paul confirms elsewhere,
   where he teaches us that the gifts are so distributed as that no
   individual should have all, but each

   "according to the measure of the gift of Christ."
   (Ephesians 4:7.)

   29. And Moses said unto him, Enviest thou for my sake? This may be
   understood in two different ways. Some take it, as if Moses had said,
   It is no business of yours, if I have suffered any loss: and if
   anything is taken from me, it would be mine and not yours to grieve and
   grudge; but I think Moses spoke more simply, as if he had said, Behold,
   how differently I feel from you; for I, whose cause you suppose
   yourselves to be promoting, should desire that all were endowed with
   the spirit of prophecy. So was that foolish jealousy admirably rebuked,
   which would put a restraint upon God's blessing, so greatly to be
   desired by every pious mind. At the same time, we fully perceive the
   gentleness and humility of Moses, whom no ambition, nor consideration
   of his personal dignity, prevents from willingly admitting the very
   lowliest into companionship with himself. If any should object that it
   is God's pleasure, in order to enhance the excellency of the gift, that
   there should be but few prophets in the Church, and consequently that
   Moses inconsiderately sought for that, which is in repugnance to God's
   counsel in this matter, the reply is easy, that, al -- though the
   saints acquiesce in His ordinary dispensations, and are persuaded that
   the arrangement, which He makes, is the best, yet that it is an act of
   piety in them to desire to communicate with all others what is given to
   themselves, so as to be anxious rather to be last of all, than to
   begrudge perfection to their brethren. In sum, Moses declares that
   nothing would be more gratifying to him, than that God should diffuse
   the grace of the spirit of prophecy amongst the whole people, so that
   all should be partakers of it, from the least to the greatest.

   30. And Moses gat him into the camp. Although, after the appointment of
   the Seventy, all betook themselves to their own stations and
   dwelling-places, yet there is no doubt but that they were all
   forewarned of the approaching miracle, so as to be universally
   attentive to the event, which is presently related. When it is said
   that it was "a wind of the Lord" which brought the quails, there was no
   other reason for this than that God might openly manifest that all
   things under heaven are subject to His dominion, and are ready to obey
   Him. He might, indeed, have created the quails at will (nutu,) just as
   He rained the manna from heaven; nor was it natural that by the force
   of the winds such an abundance of birds should be east, and heaped
   together in one place; but by using the aid of the wind He confirmed
   what is written in Psalm 104:3, 4, that "He maketh the winds his
   messengers [35] and they bear him on their wings;" because in their
   swiftness they rapidly bear His commandments from the east to the west.
   Now, although it is true in the abstract that the winds come from Him,
   so that they are only His breath, and that the air cannot be stirred in
   the slightest degree except at His will, still an extraordinary miracle
   is here specified, as before in the passage of the Red Sea. The Prophet
   in the Psalm goes further:

   "He caused an east wind to blow in the heaven; and by his power he
   brought in the south wind," (Psalm 78:26,)

   in which words He signifies that the whole air was shaken, since the
   winds suddenly arose from different quarters, which covered the earth
   in all directions with an immense multitude of the birds.

   When he says that the earth was filled "as it were a day's journey," I
   do not understand it as if the dead birds lay at so great a distance,
   but that they occupied such a space of ground in thick heaps, and, in
   fact, continuously. And this also we gather from the Psalm, where the
   Prophet says, that they fell "in the midst of their camp," and were
   carried to their tents round about. (Psalm 78:28.) What is added, as to
   their being "two cubits high," I do not interpret, as some do, [36]
   that they did not fly above two cubits from the ground, so as to be
   more easily taken with the hand; but that there was such a mass of
   them, that every one might carry away as much as he would. For to this
   also do those magnificent descriptions in the Psalm relate, whereby the
   miracle is extolled:

   "He rained flesh also upon them as dust, and leathered fowls, like as
   the sand of the sea." (Psalm 78:27.)

   But how "they spread them abroad -- round about," [37] is not very
   clear to me; unless, perhaps, they were placed in cages or coops, and
   daily taken out for food.

   33. And while the flesh was yet between their teeth. Moses does not
   specify any particular day; but only that God did not wait till satiety
   had produced disgust, but inflicted the punishment in the midst of
   their greediness. We may, however, conjecture from what precedes, that
   time was given them to gorge themselves. From whence their insatiable
   voracity may be gathered, which prevailed for so many continuous days,
   and could not be appeased by any quantity of food. God, therefore,
   allowed them time abundantly sufficient for them to gorge themselves,
   unless their gluttony was prodigious: and yet punished their
   intemperance, while the meat was yet in their mouths. They were, then,
   suddenly surprised in the midst of their guttling; and hence it is said
   in the Psalm, (Psalm 78:30,) "they were not yet estranged from their
   lust;" just as any glutton might choke himself, by devouring more than
   his throat could hold. Nor is that at variance with their repletion, of
   which mention was lately made; for, however the belly may swell with
   the quantity of its contents, the furious lust of eating is never
   appeased. But, in order that their punishment might be more manifest,
   God inflicted it in the very act; nor could any better opportunity have
   been chosen.

   34. And he called the name of that place Kibroth-hattaavah. It was
   requisite that some memorial of so great a sin should exist, that the
   sons might not imitate their fathers. Heretofore God had sustained them
   with a food both agreeable and wholesome: by longing for unlawful
   nourishment they were their own poisoners and murderers. Now, such
   ingratitude was deservedly to be detested by their posterity; and
   therefore the name was given to the place, not without the inspiration
   of the Spirit of God. So Paul reminds us, that in this narrative God's
   judgment against corrupt and vicious lusts was portrayed, that we might
   ourselves learn not to lust. (1 Corinthians 10:6.) I have already
   briefly explained how far our appetites are to be restrained, and what
   intemperance, properly speaking, is.

   saying, Take Aaron thy brother, and Eleazar his son, and bring them up
   into the mount, before all the congregation: and strip Aaron of his
   garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son, and Aaron shall be
   gathered unto his people, and shall die there. (Numbers 20:25, 26.) God
   commands a priest to be appointed before all the congregation, that is,
   He instructs and shows us, that the ordinations of priests ought only
   to be solemnized with the knowledge of the people standing by, that so
   by their presence either the crimes of the wicked may be detected, or
   the merits of the good proclaimed, and so the ordination be right and
   lawful, as having been examined with the suffrage and judgment of all."
   -- Epistles of S. Cyprian. Oxford Transl. 1844, pp. 211, 212. The above
   quotation is from a letter written in the names of Cyprian and
   thirty-six of his brethren, as a reply to inquiries made by the
   presbyter and people of Leon and Astorga, and the deacons and faithful
   people in Merida. Cyprian has not cited Numbers 11:16, in any of the
   works now acknowledged as his, though the argument thus drawn from
   Numbers 20:25, 28, would have been more reasonably collected from the
   text, to which Calvin has assumed that he referred.

   will be rectified, and the sense clear: At non congregati sunt, sed

   Numbers 12

   Numbers 12:1-16

   1. And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses because of the Ethiopian
   woman whom he had married: for he had married an Ethiopian woman.

   1. Et loquuta est Maria et Aharon contra Mosen propter uxorem
   AEthiopissam quam acceperat: uxorem enim AEthiopissam acceperat.

   2. And they said, Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? hath he
   not spoken also by us? And the Lord heard it.

   2. Et dixerunt, Nunquid solummodo per Mosen loquutus est Jehova? nonne
   etiam per nos loquutus est? Et audivit Jehova.

   3. (Now the man Moses was very meek, above all the men which were upon
   the face of the earth.)

   3. Vir autem ille Moses mansuetissimus fuit prae cunctis hominibus qui
   erant super faciem terrae.

   4. And the Lord spoke suddenly unto Moses, and unto Aaron, and unto
   Miriam, Come out ye three unto the tabernacle of the congregation. And
   they three cane out.

   4. Ergo extemplo dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Aharon et Mariam, Egredimini
   vos tres ad tabernaculum conventionis. Et egressi sunt ipsi tres.

   5. And the Lord came down in the pillar of the cloud, and stood in the
   door of the tabernacle, and called Aaron and Miriam: and they both came
   forth.

   5. Et descendit Jehova in columna nubis, et stetit ad ostium
   tabernaculi: vocavitque Aharon et Mariam, et egressi sunt ambo ipsi.

   6. And he said, Hear now my words: If there be a prophet among you, f
   the Lord will make myself known unto him in a vision, and will speak
   unto him in a dream.

   6. Quibus dixit, Audite nunc verba mea, Si fuerit propheta vobis, ego,
   Jehova in visione apparebo ei, in somnio loquar cum eo.

   7. My servant Moses is not so, who is faithful in all mine house.

   7. Non sic servus meus Moses, qui in tota domo mea fidelis est.

   8. With him will I speak mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in
   dark speeches; and the similitude of the Lord shall he behold:
   wherefore then were ye not afraid to speak against my servant Moses?

   8. Ore ad os loquor cum eo, atque in visione: non autem per aenigmata,
   neque (vel, sed) per similitudinem Jehovae aspiciet: quare ergo non
   timuistis loqui adversus servum meum Mosen?

   9. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them; and he departed.

   9. Exarsit ergo furor Jehovae in eos, et discessit.

   10. And the cloud departed from off the tabernacle; and, behold, Miriam
   became leprous, white as snow: and Aaron looked upon Miriam, and,
   behold, she was leprous.

   10. Nubesque recessit a tabernaculo: et ecce Maria erat leprosa sicut
   nix, respexitque Aharon Mariam, et ecce erat leprosa.

   11. And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas! my Lord, I beseech thee, lay not
   the sin upon us, wherein we have done foolishly, and wherein we have
   sinned.

   11. Tunc dixit Aharon ad Mosen, Quaeso domine mi, ne nunc nobis imputes
   peccatum: quia stulte egimus, et quia peccavimus.

   12. Let her not be as one dead, of whom the flesh is half consumed when
   he cometh out of his mother's womb.

   12. Ne, quaeso, sit quasi abortivus foetus, qui dum egreditur ex utero
   matris suae consumptus est dimidio suae carnis.

   13. And Moses cried unto the Lord, saying, Heal her now, O God, I
   beseech thee.

   13. Clamavit itaque Moses ad Jehovam, dicendo, Deus, quaeso, sana nunc
   illam:

   14. And the Lord said unto Moses, If her father had but spit in her
   face, should she not be ashamed seven days? let her be shut out from
   the camp seven days, and after that let her be received in again.

   14. Respondit Jehova ad Mosen, Quod si pater ejus spuendo spuisset in
   faciem ejus, nonne erubesceret septem diebus? Excludatur septem diebus
   extra castra, et deinde recipietur.

   15. And Miriam was shut out from the camp seven days; and the people
   journeyed not till Miriam was brought in again.

   15. Itaque reclusa est Maria extra castra septem diebus: neque populus
   progressus est, donec reciperetur Maria.

   16. And afterward the people removed from Hazeroth, and pitched in the
   wilderness of Paran.

   16. Postea autem profectus est populus de Haseroth, et castrametati
   sunt in deserto Paran.

   1. And Miriam and Aaron spoke against Moses. This relation is
   especially worthy of observation for many reasons. If Aaron and Miriam
   had always quietly and cordially supported the honor of their brother,
   and had not been carried away by perverse and ungodly jealousy, their
   harmony, however holy it was, would have been perverted by the
   injustice of many, and alleged against them as a deceitful and
   insidious conspiracy. It came to pass, then, in the wonderful
   providence of God, that his own brother and sister set on foot a
   contention with respect to the supremacy, and endeavored to degrade
   Moses from the position in which God had placed him: for thus all
   suspicion of family favor was removed, and it was clearly shown that
   Moses, being opposed by his own belongings, was sustained by the power
   of God alone. At the same time it may be perceived how natural is
   ambition to the minds of almost all men, and also how blind and furious
   is the lust of dominion. Aaron and Miriam contend with their own
   brother for the supremacy; and yet they had received the most abundant
   proofs, that lie, whom they desire to overthrow, had been elevated by
   the hand of God, and was thus maintained in his position. For Moses had
   arrogated nothing to himself; and, therefore, it was not allowable that
   man should attempt to undermine the dignity of that high office, which
   God had conferred upon him. Besides, God had ennobled their own house
   and name in the person of Moses, and out of favor to him they had also
   been endued with peculiar gifts of their own. For by what right had
   Miriam obtained the gift of prophecy, except for the fuller
   ratification of her brother's power? But the arrogance and ingratitude
   of Aaron was still more disgraceful. He had been by his brother
   associated with himself: Moses had allowed the high-priesthood to be
   transferred to him and his descendants, and rims had placed his own in
   subjection to them. What, then, was there for Aaron to begrudge his
   brother; when so exalted a dignity was vested in his own sons, whilst
   all the race of Moses was degraded? Still he was so blinded as to deem
   the honor of his brother a reproach to himself; at any rate, he could
   not endure to be second to him in dignity, although he was his superior
   in right of the priesthood. By this example, then, we are taught how
   anxiously we should beware of so baneful a plague (as ambition). The
   wicked brother [38] in the tragic Poet says: --

   "For, if injustice must at all be done,
   Tis best to do it for dominion;"

   that, under this pretext, he might through treachery and murder proceed
   against his own blood with impunity. Now, although we all hold this
   sentiment in detestation, still it plainly shows that, when the lust
   for rule takes possession of men's hearts, not only do they abandon the
   love of justice, but that humanity becomes altogether extinct in them,
   since brothers thus contend with each other, and rage, as it were,
   against their own bowels. Indeed it is astonishing that, when this vice
   has been so often and so severely condemned in the opinion of all ages,
   the human race has not been ever freed from it; nay, that the Church of
   God has always been infested by this disease, than which none is worse:
   for ambition has been, and still is, the mother of all errors, of all
   disturbances and sects. Since Aaron and his sister were infected by it,
   how easily may it overspread the multitude! But I now proceed to
   examine the words.

   Miriam is here put before Aaron, not by way of honorable distinction,
   but because she stirred up the strife, and persuaded her brother to
   take her side; for the ambition of the female sex is wonderful; and
   often have women, more high-spirited than men, been the instigators not
   merely of squabbles, but of mighty wars, so that great cities and
   countries have been shaken by their violent conduct. Still. however,
   this does not diminish the guilt of Aaron, who, at the instance of his
   foolish sister, engaged in an unjust and wicked contest with his
   brother, and even declared himself an enemy to God's grace. Further,
   because they were unable to allege any grounds, upon which Moses in
   himself was not far their superior, they seek to bring disgrace upon
   him on account of his wife; as if in half of himself he was inferior to
   them, because he had married a woman who was not of their own race, but
   a foreigner. They, therefore, cast ignominious aspersions upon him in
   the person of his wife, as if it were not at all becoming that he
   should be accounted the prince and head of the people, since his wife,
   and the companion of his bed, was a Gentile woman. I do not by any
   means agree with those who think that she was any other than Zipporah,
   [39] since we hear nothing of the death of Zipporah, nay, she had been
   brought back by Jethro, her father, only a little while before the
   delivery of the Law; whilst it is too absurd to charge the holy Prophet
   with the reproach of polygamy. Besides, as an octogenarian, he would
   have been but little suited for a second marriage. Again, how would
   such a marriage have been practicable in the desert? It is, therefore,
   sufficiently clear that they refer to Zipporah, who is called an
   Ethiopian woman, because the Scripture comprehends the Midianites under
   this name: although I have no doubt but that they maliciously selected
   this name, for the purpose of awakening greater odium against Moses. I
   designedly forbear from adducing the frivolous glosses in which some
   indulge. [40] Moses, however, acknowledges that it [41] was not
   accorded to him to have a wife of the holy race of Abraham.

   2. And they said, Hath the Lord indeed spoken only by Moses? They pride
   themselves on their gift of prophecy, which ought rather to have
   schooled them to humility. But such is the natural depravity of men,
   not only to abuse the gifts of God unto contempt of their brethren, but
   so to magnify them by their ungodly and sacrilegious boasting, as to
   obscure the glory of their Author. Miriam and Aaron had received the
   spirit of prophecy, in order that the grace of God might shine forth in
   them; but from thence they raise up clouds to throw darkness upon the
   light, which was far brighter in Moses. They boast themselves to be
   prophets; why, then, do they not consider that there was no ground for
   glorying in this, inasmuch as that, which had been gratuitously
   bestowed upon them by God, was not their own? Again, why do they not
   correctly estimate their own insignificance in comparison with the
   excellency of Moses, so as, by willingly yielding to him, to show that
   they set at its proper value what God had respectively conferred upon
   them? Lest, then, the knowledge of those graces which God has intrusted
   to us, should puff us up with pride and presumption, let us remember
   that the more each of us has received, the greater obligations are we
   under to God and our brethren; and let us also reflect how much is
   wanting, in us, and how much, too, God has conferred on others, so as
   to prefer to ourselves those whom God has designed to honor.

   3. Now the man Moses was very meek. This parenthesis is inserted, in
   order that we might perceive that God was not moved by any complaint of
   Moses, to be so greatly wroth with Aaron and Miriam. It is said that
   "the Lord heard," that is to say, to undertake the cause in His
   character of Judge: and it is now added, that He spontaneously summoned
   the criminals to His tribunal, though no accuser requested that justice
   should be done him. For this is the, tendency of the eulogium of his
   meekness, as if Moses had said that he submitted in silence to the
   wrong, because, in his meekness, he imposed patience on himself.
   Moreover, he, does not praise his own Virtue for the sake of boasting,
   but in order to exhort us by his example, and, if it should be our lot
   to be treated with indignity, quietly and calmly to wait for the
   judgment of God. For whence does it come that, when any one has injured
   us, our indignation carries away our feelings in all directions, and
   our pain boils up without measure, except because we do not think that
   our ills are regarded by God until we have made loud and boisterous
   complaints? This passage, then, teaches us that although the good and
   gentle refrain from reproaches and accusations, God nevertheless keeps
   watch for them, and, whilst they are silent, the wickedness of the
   ungodly cries out to, and is heard by, God. Again, the silence of
   long-suffering itself is more effectual before God than any cries,
   however loud. But if God does not immediately proceed to execute
   vengeance, we must bear in mind what is written elsewhere, that the
   blood of Abel cried out after his death, that the murder which Cain had
   committed might not be unpunished. (Genesis 4:10.)

   4. Come out ye three unto the tabernacle. God calls Aaron and Miriam to
   the tabernacle, that the very sanctity of the place may cast down their
   haughtiness; for forgetfulness of God had overspread their minds, when
   they began to be so insolent before men. They are, therefore, brought
   back to the presence of God, from which all their senses had turned
   away, in order that they at length might learn to revere Moses, whose
   cause is upheld by God. God commands them to "hear His words," because
   they would never have dared to murmur against Moses if they had
   reflected on the account they would have to give. God, therefore,
   claims their attention, that they may learn to recollect themselves,
   and to awaken from the senselessness of their presumption. Moreover,
   they are separated from Moses, that they may confess their inferiority,
   and be ashamed of their temerity in daring to compare themselves with
   him.

   6. If there be a prophet among you. He makes mention of two methods by
   which the will of God was wont to be revealed to the prophets, viz.,
   visions and dreams. He does not, however, here use the word chzvn
   chazon, [42] which signifies a prophecy as well as a vision, but mr'h,
   marah, expressive of some visible appearance, which confirms and
   ratifies the truth of His word (oraculi) to the eyes and all the
   senses. Thus has God often appeared to His servants, so that His
   majesty might be inscribed upon His addresses to them. Before the
   giving of the Law such visions were frequently vouchsafed to the
   Patriarchs; whilst sometimes they were instructed by dreams. Thus Joel,
   when he promises that under the kingdom of Christ there shall be a
   complete fullness of all revelations, also enumerates these two forms
   of them,

   "Your sons (he says) and your daughters shall prophesy: your old men
   shall dream dreams, your young men shall see visions."
   (Joel 2:28.)

   But we know that the prophets described the kingdom of Christ under the
   likeness of their own times: when, therefore, God sets forth these two
   ordinary modes of revelation, he withdraws Moses from the condition of
   others, as if to exalt him by a special privilege. Now, since Aaron and
   Miriam were not superior to others, they were thus reminded that they
   were far behind Moses in rank. With this view he is said to be
   "faithful in all God's house;" in quoting which passage in order to
   prove his inferiority to Christ, the Apostle says he was a servant, and
   a member of the Church, whereas Christ was its Lord and builder, or
   creator. (Hebrews 3:2-6.) But the difference between them is more
   clearly specified immediately afterwards, viz., that God speaks to him
   "mouth to mouth," by which expression, as I have said elsewhere, [43]
   more intimate and familiar communication is denoted. Still God does not
   thus deprive the prophets of anything which is requisite for the
   discharge of their office; but merely establishes Moses as the chief of
   them all. It is true, indeed, that the Patriarchs are so ranked, as
   Abraham was called a prophet by the mouth of God, (Genesis 20:7;) and
   the Prophet thus names him together with Isaac and Jacob in Psalm
   105:15; but still God at the same time includes the whole dispensation,
   which He afterwards chose to employ under the Law; and so prefers Moses
   to all who were hereafter to arise.

   Further, the word vision is used in a different sense from that which
   it had just above; for God, distinguishing Moses from others, says that
   He speaks with him in vision, [44] which it would be absurd to explain
   as meaning an ordinary or common vision. It therefore here signifies
   actual sight, [45] which He contrasts with "dark speeches (aenigmata)
   and similitude," which word is equivalent to a representation (figura,)
   if the negative be referred to both. For there are some who take
   similitude for a lively and express image; as if God should assert that
   He reveals His face to Moses; and therefore read the clause
   adversatively, as I have given it in the margin. But the former reading
   is the most natural.

   I have elsewhere treated of dreams and visions. It will then be
   sufficient to give the sum in one word, namely, that they were seals
   for the confirmation of prophecies; so that the Prophets, as if sent
   from heaven, might with full confidence declare themselves to be God's
   lawful interpreters. For visions had their own peculiar marks, to
   distinguish them from phantoms and false imaginations; and dreams also
   were accompanied by their signs, in order to remove all doubt of their
   authenticity. The prophets, therefore, were fully conscious of their
   vocation, so that nothing was wanting to the assurance of faith.
   Meanwhile, the false prophets dressed themselves up in these masks to
   deceive. Thus Jeremiah, in refutation of their ungodly pretences, says,

   "The prophet that hath a dream, let him tell a dream; and he that hath
   my word, let him speak my word faithfully. What is the chaff to the
   wheat, saith the Lord?" (Jeremiah 23:28.)

   9. And the anger of the Lord was kindled against them. The
   expostulation is succeeded by punishment. God's departure was a sign of
   immediate condemnation; because there was no need of any further
   questioning, as concerning some matter of obscurity. After God, then,
   had convicted them of their sin, and had inveighed in a severe and
   stern reprehension against the ingratitude of Miriam and Aaron, He
   first pronounced their sentence, and then suddenly withdrew. What
   follows, that "the cloud departed," is added in explanation; for God,
   who fills all things, never moves from His place; but His name is
   applied metaphorically to the cloud, which was the symbol of His
   absence or presence.

   The nature of the punishment which was inflicted upon Miriam was very
   appropriate to the offence. The foolish woman, puffed up with pride,
   had coveted more than was lawful; and her ignominy was the just reward
   of her arrogance, according to the declaration of Christ, "Every one
   that exalteth himself shall be abased." (Luke 18:14.) Let us
   understand, then, that in proportion as the proud are led away by their
   ambition to long for unlawful honors, they bring upon themselves
   nothing but disgrace; and although they may gloriously triumph for a
   season, still, it cannot be but that their glory will at length be
   turned into disgrace. For inasmuch as all who exalt themselves wage war
   with God, He must needs encounter them with the awful power of His
   hand, in order to restrain their madness. Now, whosoever are moved by
   envy to enter into contention with His servants, endeavor, as hr as in
   them lies, to overthrow His glory by obscuring the gifts of the Spirit.
   No wonder, then, that God should avenge the insult offered to Himself,
   and should repay them with the infamy they deserve; as it is written,

   "Them that honor me I will honor, and they that despise me shall be
   lightly esteemed." (1 Samuel 2:30.)

   Miriam desired to be equal with her brother, whom God had exalted above
   all others; what she attains is, that she should not occupy the
   extremist corner of the people, but be cut off from companionship with
   mankind. A similar instance occurred in the case of king Uzziah, who,
   not contented with the royal dignity, when he had unlawfully attempted
   to make an incense-offering, was also smitten with leprosy, so as to be
   no longer suffered to continue in association even with the common
   people. (2 Chronicles 26:16-21.)

   Here, however, the question arises, why, when Aaron participated in the
   guilt, he was exempted from the punishment? If no reason existed, still
   we should have to adore the judgment of God; for it is not our business
   to complain, when He has mercy upon whom He will have mercy,
   nevertheless, it appears probable that God's wrath was more exceedingly
   kindled against Miriam, because she had applied the torch to the
   ungodly contention, and had inflamed her brother's mind, as we see at
   the beginning of the chapter. It was just, then, that the blame should
   rest on her, since she had been the origin of the evil. I imagine,
   however, that in sparing Aaron, He had regard to the priesthood,
   inasmuch as, in his person, it would have been subjected almost to
   eternal disgrace. Since, therefore, Aaron was an image of God's
   only-begotten Son and our only Mediator, and this great dignity had
   recently had its commencement in him, it was of exceeding importance
   that he should be exempted from such infamy, lest any diminution of the
   reverence due to religion should arise.

   11. And Aaron said unto Moses, Alas! my lord. Although Aaron was aware
   that, through God's indulgence, his own punishment was remitted, still
   he does not cease to consider what he had deserved. For we ought not to
   wait until God smites ourselves, but since in chastising others He
   invites us to repentance, although He may spare ourselves, we should
   profit betimes by their punishments. The disfigurement, therefore, of
   his sister, alarmed and terrified Aaron, so that, examining his own
   condition, he acknowledged himself to be deserving of a similar
   judgment. His humble prayer manifests that those high aspirations were
   subdued, which had carried him away into unholy jealousy. Moses, who
   was younger than himself, and whose superiority he just before could
   not endure, tie now calls his lord, and confesses himself to be subject
   to his authority and power. Thus the dread of punishment was the best
   medicine to cure his disease of ambition. In beseeching Moses not to
   impute his sin to him, he does not usurp for mortal man a right which
   God by Isaiah claims for Himself alone; [46] but inasmuch as Moses had
   been injured, he asks his pardon, lest by his accusation he should be
   brought before the divine tribunal. Where he confesses his own and his
   sister's foolishness, he does not extenuate the grossness of his crime,
   as most people do, when they generally seek to cover their
   transgressions under the plea of error or thoughtlessness; but it is
   precisely as if he had said that they were senseless, and out of their
   minds, as we gather from the next clause, in which he plainly
   acknowledges their criminality.

   By the comparison which he introduces, it is evident that the leprosy
   of Miriam was of no ordinary kind, for nothing can be more disgusting
   than the dead body of any abortive foetus, corrupt with purulence and
   decay.

   13. And Moses cried unto the Lord. The event now proves, what was
   recently asserted, that Moses was of a meek and gentle disposition
   beyond all other men; for he is not only ready at once to forgive, but
   also intercedes with God for them. And thus the presumption of Miriam
   is best reproved; for the only hope of safety that remains to her is in
   the dignity of Moses, which of late she could not endure.

   From the reply of God, it is manifest that the punishment which she
   alone had received was intended for the instruction of all. The pride
   and temerity of Miriam were sufficiently chastised, but God wished it
   to be a lesson for all, that every one should confine himself to his
   own bounds. Meanwhile, let us learn from this passage to pay due honor
   to the judgments of God, so that they may suffice us as the rule of
   supreme equity. For if such power over their children is accorded to
   earthly parents, as that they may put them to shame at their will, how
   much more reverence is due to our heavenly Father, when he brands us
   with any mark of disgrace? This was the reason why Miriam was shut out
   for seven days, not only that she might mourn apart by herself, but
   also that her chastisement might be profitable to all. It is likewise
   addressed to us, that we may learn to blush whensoever God is angry
   with our sins, and thus that shame may produce in us a dislike of sin.
   This special example afterwards passed into a law, as we have already
   seen, (Deuteronomy 24:9); [47] for when God commands lepers to be
   separated, He recalls to the recollection of the people what He had
   appointed with respect to Miriam, lest, if internal impurity be
   cherished, its infection may spread beyond ourselves.

   Numbers 13

   Numbers 13:1-33

   1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Send thou men, that they may search the land of Canaan, which I give
   unto the children of Israel: of every tribe of their fathers shall ye
   send a man, every one a ruler among them.

   2. Mitte tibi viros qui explorent terram Chanaan, quam ego daturus sum
   filiis Israel, singulos viros de singulis tribubus patrum suorum
   mittetis, unumquenque principem inter eos.

   3 And Moses, by the commandment of the Lord, sent them from the
   wilderness of Paran: all those men were heads of the children of
   Israel.

   3. Misit ergo illos Moses e deserto Paran, juxta sermonem Jehovae: et
   universi ipsi viri principes filiorum Israel erant.

   4. And these were their names: Of the tribe of Reuben: Shammua the son
   of Zaccur.

   4. Haec autem sunt nomina eorum. De tribu Ruben, Sammua filius Zachur.

   5. Of the tribe of Simeon; Shaphat the son of Hori.

   5. De tribu Simeon, Saphat filius Hori.

   6. Of the tribe of Judah; Caleb the son of Jephunneh

   6. De tribu Jehuda, Caleb filius Jephuneh.

   7. Of the tribe of Issachar; Igal the son of Joseph.

   7. De tribu Issachar, Igal, filius Joseph.

   8. Of the tribe of Ephraim; Oshea the son of Nun.

   8. De tribu Ephraim, Hosea filius Nun.

   9. Of the tribe of Benjanfin; Palti the son of Raphu.

   9. De tribu Benjamin, Palti filius Raphu.

   10. Of the tribe of Zehulun; Gaddiel the son of Sodi.

   10. De tribu Zebulon, Gaddiel filius Sodi.

   11. Of the tribe of Joseph, namely, of the tribe of Manasseh; Gaddi the
   son of Susi.

   11. De tribu Joseph, de tribu Menasseh, Gaddi filius Susi.

   12. Of the tribe of Dan; Ammiel the son of Gemalli.

   12. De tribu Dan, Ammiel filius Gemalli.

   13. Of the tribe of Asher; Sether the son of Michael.

   13. De tribu Aser, Sethur filius Michael.

   14. Of the tribe of Naphtali; Nahbi the son of Vophsi.

   14. De tribu Nephthali, Nahbi filius Vophsi.

   15. Of the tribe of Gad; Geuel the son of Machi.

   15. De tribu Gad, Guel filius Machi.

   16. These are the names of the men which Moses sent to spy out the
   land. And Moses called Oshea the son of Nun, Jehoshua.

   16. Haec sunt nomina virorum quos misit Moses ad explorandam terram: et
   appellavit Moses Hosea filium Nun, Jehosua.

   17. And Moses sent them to spy out the land of Canaan, and said unto
   them, Get you up this way southward, and go up into the mountain;

   17. Misit igitur eos Moses ad explorandam terram Chanaan, dicens illis,
   Ascendite hac per meridiem, et conscendatis montes;

   18. And see the land, what it is; and the people that dwelleth therein,
   whether they be strong or weak, few or many;

   18. Et consideretis terram ipsam qualis sit, et populum qui habitat in
   ea, utrum fortis sit an debilis, utrum paucus sit an multus.

   19. And what the land is that they dwell in, whether it be good or bad;
   and what cities they be that they dwell in, whether in tents, or in
   strong holds;

   19. Qualis, inquam, sit terra in qua sit habitator, utrum bona sit an
   mala: et quales urbes in quibus sit habitator, utrum in castris an in
   munitionibus.

   20. And what the land is, whether it be fat or lean, whether there be
   wood therein, or not: and be ye of good courage, and bring of the fruit
   of the land. (Now the time was the time of the first-ripe grapes.)

   20. Qualis rursum terra, utrum pinguis sit an macra: utrum sint in ea
   arbores an non: et estote forti animo, atque decerpite e fructu terrae.
   (Dies autem illi erant dies primitiarum uvarum.)

   21. So they went up, and searched the land, from the wilderness of Zin
   unto Rehob, as men come to Hamath.

   21. Ascenderunt igitur, et exploraverunt terram, a deserto Sin usque ad
   Rehob, ingrediendo Hamath.

   22. And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron; where Ahiman,
   Sheshai, and Talmai, the children of Anak, were. (Now Hebron was built
   seven years before Zoan in Egypt.)

   22. Et ascenderunt per meridiem, et venerunt usque ad Hebron, ibi autem
   erat Ahiman, Sesai, et Thalmai, filii Anac. Hebron vero septem annis
   aedificata fuit ante Soan AEgypti.

   23. And they came unto the brook of Eshcol, and cut down from thence a
   branch with one cluster of grapes, and they bare it between two upon a
   staff; and they brought of the pomegranates, and of the figs.

   23. Perverterunt itaque usque ad vallem Eschol, et absciderunt illinc
   palmitem et botrum uvarum unum, et portaverunt illum vecte bini, et de
   malogranatis et de ficubus.

   24. The place was called the brook Eshcol, because of the cluster of
   grapes which the children of Israel cut down from thence.

   24. Locus ille vocatus est Nahal Eschol propter botrum quem absciderunt
   inde filii Israel.

   25. And they returned from searching of the land after forty days.

   25. Reversi sunt ab exploranda terra post quadraginta dies.

   26. And they went and came to Moses, and to Aaron, and to all the
   congregation of the children of Israel, unto the wilderness of Paran,
   to Kadesh; and brought back word unto them, and unto all the
   congregation, and showed them the fruit of the land.

   26. Profecti ergo sunt, et venerunt ad Mosen et Aharon, et ad universum
   coetum filiorum Israel, in desertum Paran in Cades: et retulerunt eis
   rem, atque universo coetui, ostenderuntque eis fructum terrae.

   27. And they told him, and said, We came unto the land whither thou
   sentest us, and surely it floweth with milk and honey; and this is the
   fruit of it.

   27. Narraverunt ergo ei: et dixerunt, Pervenimus ad terram ad quam
   misisti nos; et certe affluit lacte et melle: et ipse est fructus ejus.

   28. Nevertheless the people be strong that dwell in the laud, and the
   cities are walled, and very great: and, moreover, we saw the children
   of Anak there.

   28. Nisi quod fortis est populus qui incolit cam, et urbes munitae
   sunt, et magnae admodum: ac filios Enac vidimus illic.

   29. The Amalekites dwell in the land of the south; and the Hittites,
   and the Jebusites, and the Amorites, dwell in the mountains; and the
   Canaanites dwell by the sea, and by the coast of Jordan.

   29. Amalec habitat in terra meridiana: Hitthaeus autem, et Jebusaeus,
   et Amorrhaeus inhabitant montes: Chananaeus vero habitat juxta mare et
   ad ripam Jordanis.

   30. And Caleb stilled the people before Moses, and said, Let us go up
   at once, and possess it; for we are well able to overcome it.

   30. Tacere vero fecit Caleb populum ad Mosen, et dixit, Ascendendo
   ascendamus et possideamus: nam praevalendo praevalebimus contra cam.

   31. But the men that went up with him said, We be not able to go up
   against the people; for they are stronger than we.

   31. At viri qui ascenderant cum eo, dixerunt, Non poterimus ascendere
   contra populum illum, quia fortior est nobis.

   32. And they brought up an evil report of the land which they had
   searched unto the children of Israel, saying, The land, through which
   we have gone to search it, is a land that eateth up the inhabitants
   thereof; and all the people that we saw in it are men of a great
   stature.

   32. Et detraxerunt terrae quam exploraverunt, apud filios Israel,
   dicendo, Terra per quam transivimus ut exploraremus eam, terra est quae
   consumit habitatores suos: et omnis populus quem vidimus in medio ejus,
   viri procerae staturae sunt.

   33. And there we saw the giants, the sons of Anak, which come of the
   giants: and we were in our own sight as grasshoppers, and so we were in
   their sight.

   33. Atque illuc vidimus gigantes filios Enac, e gigantibus. Et fiumus
   sicut locustae in oculis nostris, sic fuimus in oculis eorum.

   The Repetition of the same Narrative

   Deuteronomy 1

   Deuteronomy 1:19-25

   19. And when we departed from Horeb, we went through all that great and
   terrible wilderness, which ye saw by the way of the mountain of the
   Amorites, as the Lord our God commanded us; and we came to
   Kadesh-barnea.

   19. Profecti de Horeb perambulavimus totam solitudinem magnam et
   terribilem hanc quam vidistis per viam montis Emorrhaei, quemadmodum
   praeceperat Jehova Deus noster nobis, ac pervenimus usque ad Cades
   Barnea.

   20. And I said unto you, Ye are come unto the mountain of the Amorites,
   which the Lord our God doth give unto us.

   20. Et dixi vobis, Pervenistis usque ad montem Emorrhaei quem Jehova
   Deus noster dat nobis.

   21. Behold, the Lord thy God hath set the land before thee; go up and
   possess it, as the Lord God of thy fathers hath said unto thee; fear
   not, neither be discouraged.

   21. Vide, dedit Jehova Deus tuus coram te terram, ascende, posside
   quemadmodum dixit Jehova Deus patrum tuorum tibi, ne timeas, neque
   consterneris.

   22. And ye came near unto me every one of you, and said, We will send
   men before us, and they shall search us out the land, and bring us word
   again by what way we must go up, and into what cities we shall come.

   22. Accessistis autem ad me omnes vos, et dixistis, Mittamus viros ante
   nos qui explorent nobis terram, et referant nobis rem, et viam per quam
   ascendamus, et urbes ad quas veniamus.

   23. And the saying pleased me well; and I took twelve men of you, one
   of a tribe:

   23. Quod placuit in oculis meis, et sumpsi ex vobis duodecim viros,
   virum unum ex quaque tribu.

   24. And they turned, and went up into the mountain, and came unto the
   valley of Eshcol, and searched it out.

   24. Qui abierunt et ascenderunt in montem, veneruntque usque ad vallem
   Eschol, et exploraverunt eam.

   25. And they took of the fruit of the land in their hands, and brought
   it down unto us, and brought us word again, and said, It is a good land
   which the Lord our God doth give us.

   25. Tuleruntque in manu sua e fructu terrae illius, et attulerunt
   nobis, retuleruntque nobis rem, ac dixerunt, Bona est terra quam Jehova
   Deus noster dat nobis.

   Numbers 12:16. And afterward the people departed from Hazeroth. At
   first sight Moses appears to be at variance with himself: for he here
   states that he sent the spies at God's command, whereas in Deuteronomy
   1:22, he relates that he made this concession at the request of the
   people; [48] but the two statements are easily reconciled. It is,
   indeed, unquestionable that God had regard to the infirmity and
   distrust of the people; for the spies are not sent to see in what
   direction the land was to be attacked, with which design two were
   afterwards sent by Joshua, but God had here no other object than to
   encourage them, when they else were cowardly and inert, to throw off
   their inactivity, and eagerly to advance. The necessity of such a
   remedy was evidently shown, when they all demanded this of Moses. The
   second narrative, therefore, is fuller, and in it Moses goes back
   further than he had done in the first, viz., that it arose from the
   timidity and pusillanimity of the people that he did not at onto hasten
   whither God invited him; for, if they had straightway obeyed, they
   would have won the land of their enemies without any delay; but they
   requested that a respite might be given them. It is, then, by no means
   inconsistent that Moses did, at the request of the people, what God at
   the same time enjoined, because he saw that they were otherwise
   hesitating, and but little disposed to advance, and needed this
   stimulus. For, if the spies had honestly per.-formed their duty, the
   people would have been led forward as if they had seen the land
   themselves, which would have been the readiest means for putting an end
   to all delays.

   First, however, the place is described, from whence the spies were
   sent, viz., at no great distance from mount Sinai, although they had
   encamped twice, so that it was their third station. It has already been
   stated in chapter 10, that the cloud rested in the wilderness of Paran,
   which some understand to have been said by anticipation, (prolepsin,)
   as if Moses had said that, from the time when the people left Mount
   Sinai, they had not made any permanent halt, until they came to that
   wilderness, and there pitched their tents. But this opinion is by no
   means consistent; for it is clear that they stayed some time in
   Taberah; and many days were spent at the graves of lust,
   (Kibroth-hattaavah;) for there they were gorged for a month with the
   flesh of the birds, and then the pestilence attacked them, which cut
   off many of them, for whose burial it was necessary to provide. Now,
   their next halt was for more then seven days. It, therefore, appears
   probable to me that by the word Paran, a different place is not
   expressed; but that it is merely meant that, though they advanced, they
   still remained in some part of that wilderness. For, since the
   wilderness of Paran was in one direction contiguous to Mount Sinai,
   that name is sometimes given to it; for Moses certainly confounds them
   elsewhere, as also does the Prophet Habakkuk. (Deuteronomy 33:3;
   Habakkuk 3:3.)

   2. Of every tribe of their fathers shall ye send a man. If all had been
   taken from one tribe, or from any single portion of the people, their
   fidelity might have been suspected by the others. God, therefore, would
   have each tribe assured by its own witness, in order that their report
   might be more unquestionable. All cause for jealousy was also to be
   taken away; lest, if any tribe had been passed over, it might have
   excepted against the messengers, whom it supposed to have been elected
   in contempt of it. This, then, was the advantage of the equal
   distribution, lest any sinister suspicion or offence might disturb the
   unanimity of the whole people. Secondly, it is required that they
   should be possessed of personal dignity, since God commands that chief
   men should be chosen, whose testimony would be of greater authority;
   for it would have been easy to throw discredit upon obscure
   individuals. Since, however, both precautions were unsuccessful, it
   appears from hence that there is no counsel so wise and salutary as not
   to be capable of perversion by the wickedness of mankind. Thus this
   excellent providence of God rendered the people the more inexcusable.
   At the same time, God has reminded us once for all by this example
   that, however those, who seemed to be like pillars, may totter and
   stumble, or even fall altogether, still our minds must be supported by
   faith, so as not to give way.

   Their names are enumerated, in perpetual remembrance of their ignominy,
   except in the case of two, Joshua and Caleb; for it was just that their
   crime should be handed down to all ages, and that the infamy of their
   perfidiousness should never be blotted out, since they endeavored, as
   far as in them lay, to bring to naught the promise and the grace of
   God.

   Moses gave the name of Jehoshua to the son of Nun in the spirit of
   prophecy, as a presage of the exalted function to which he was
   destined. Ambition is so rash, that men are often disappointed in the
   result, when they invent titles of honor of their own accord; but Moses
   was not induced by the blindness of affection to change the name Oshea
   into Jehoshua; but God directed his tongue and mind thus to commend,
   beforehand, him who [49] was to be the future minister of their
   preservation. Still it cannot be inferred with certainty from this
   passage at what time the new name was given him; for it is not
   specified that he was called Jehoshua at the time he was sent out; nay,
   it is probable that he had been previously thus distinguished, viz.,
   from the period in which he had been associated with Moses as his
   companion and minister in all important matters.

   18. And see the land what it is. The counsel of Moses had this object,
   that the people might be made aware how rich and fertile the land was;
   for a barren country does not support a large population; and the
   healthfulness of a locality is inferred from the rigor of its
   inhabitants, tie, therefore, chiefly insists on the goodness of the
   land and its abundant production of fruits. Still, perhaps, God would
   intentionally have the Israelites forewarned, that they would have to
   do with strong and powerful enemies; lest they might be alarmed and
   discouraged at suddenly beholding them. But the main point was, that
   the pleasantness and fertility of the land might allure them to take
   possession of it.

   22. And they ascended by the south, and came unto Hebron. Their direct
   course was not, indeed, towards the south, but they proceeded along the
   southern border, until they came to Rehob and Hamath, after having
   passed the mountains. Hebron, however, in which Abraham had sojourned,
   is specified from amongst the other cities; and it is probable that the
   three sons of the giant, who are here named, were in possession of that
   city. But some think that Anak is not a proper name, and is used, by
   enallage of the number, for giants. In fact, giants are elsewhere
   called Anakim. Nor is there any doubt but that these three, who are
   mentioned, were formidable from their great stature and strength, as we
   gather from the book of Joshua. It is, then, equivalent to saying that
   this city was then possessed by warlike men, famous for their prowess.
   It will, however, appear from the end of the chapter, that Anak was the
   proper name of a man, whose sons were of excessive height. The
   antiquity of the city is afterwards signalized by comparison, viz.,
   that it was founded seven years before Zoan, one of the chief cities of
   Egypt, and of which mention is often made in Scripture. Heathen writers
   call it Tanis; [50] and it is situated on one of the seven famous
   mouths of the Nile, which is called from the city, Ostium Taniticum.
   Now, since the Egyptians gloried in their antiquity above all other
   nations, it is evident that the land of Canaan was well peopled
   immediately after the deluge; and this is a sign of its great
   fertility, for if the neighboring countries had been more so, they
   would. not have settled themselves there by preference, when they were
   at liberty to make their choice. A prolepsis is to be noted in the name
   of the valley of Eshcol: for it was afterwards that it began to be so
   called by the Israelites in memory of the remarkable cluster of grapes
   which Moses states to have been brought from hence; and this is
   immediately after specified,

   25. And they returned from searching of the land. The activity and
   diligence of the twelve men is commended, who in so short a time
   examined the whole of the land from the desert of Sin to the sea, and
   along the whole course of the Jordan; and this, too, in the hottest
   part of the year, when the grapes were beginning to ripen. Thus far,
   then, they faithfully executed the task intrusted to them. In their
   report, also, there seems to be nothing unworthy of honest men. They
   had been commanded by Moses to consider the inhabitants of the land,
   whether they were strong or weak, and also whether the cities were
   fortified; and they relate nothing which was not true and fully
   ascertained by them. In a word, at first sight their relation contains
   nothing worthy of reprehension. Nevertheless, we may gather from the
   context that the ten of them, whose desire was to turn away the people,
   spoke in such discouraging terms of their difficulties, that they
   produced exactly the contrary effect to what Moses had hoped. No other
   accusation, however, is as yet alleged against them, than that, by
   maliciously and deceptively inspiring despondency, they held back the
   people from entering the land. Although, therefore, they had not openly
   lied, they were wanting in sincerity. Perhaps, too, the whole of their
   address is not recorded; because Moses deemed it sufficient to state
   their perversity of feeling, in that they added to their praises of the
   land an exception, which overwhelmed the people's minds with fear. From
   whence also we gather a useful admonition, that crafty sophists avail
   nothing with God, when they endeavor to cover their deceit by tortuous
   prevarication's. Wherefore, if we desire to approve our discourse to
   God, we must take care to lay aside all such unfair evasions, and,
   rejecting all disguise, to speak simply and from the heart. The ten
   spies, then, lay a foundation of good faith, in order that they may
   afterwards be more competent to deceive. The land, they say, is a good
   one, except that the people are strong; and what is this but that there
   was little hope that the Israelites would obtain the blessing promised
   them by God, and that the attempt must by no means be made? With the
   same view they thunder out [51] the names of several nations, in order
   to increase the alarm; for, after having reported that they had seen
   the sons of Anak, they state that their contests would be too arduous
   with the various peoples, who would advance from all sides to resist
   them.

   30. And Caleb stilled the people before Moses. That is, he restrained
   the murmurs of the people before Moses, against whom they had begun to
   rise tumultuously. Hence it appears that much was said on both sides
   which is passed over in silence, for there would have been no need of
   restraining the violence of the people, unless the contention had waxed
   warm. His words, however, show what was the state of the whole case and
   question, viz., that the ten treacherous spies had dissuaded the people
   from foolishly advancing to the land, which it was impossible to win;
   and urged them not to attack rashly very powerful enemies, to whom they
   would be far from equally matched. But Caleb opposes them with the
   confidence of victory. We (he says) shall conquer the land, and upon
   this he grounds his exhortation. Moreover, there is no doubt but that,
   relying on God's promise, he believed that they would, be successful,
   and thus boldly foretold it, whilst the others took not at all into
   consideration that, with the banner of the Lord before them, the people
   would come into the promised inheritance.

   This does not appear to accord with what Moses relates in Deuteronomy
   1, where he absolves the spies, and casts the whole blame on the
   people; but the contradiction is easily reconciled, for there he had no
   other object than to assert the criminality of the Israelites, who, by
   their contumacy, had for a long time impeded the fulfillment of God's
   promise. Omitting, therefore, that part of the history which did not
   affect the matter in hand, he only adverts to that which convicted them
   of wicked ingratitude, i.e., that the fertility of the land was
   commended by the spies; and consequently, since the people were
   abundantly assured of God's liberality, that they sinned grossly by
   rejecting it. He, therefore, states their crime to have been, that they
   were rebellious against the mouth or word of Jehovah, viz., because
   they had refused to follow Him when He invited them.

   What Moses here ascribes to Caleb alone, he elsewhere attributes to
   Joshua also. It is plain, then, that Caleb spoke for both of them, and
   that Joshua was prudently and modestly silent, lest a tumultuous
   altercation should arise. It may, however, be probably conjectured that
   the bravery and firmness of him, who is praised, was the more
   conspicuous, whilst the honesty of Moses is perceivable, inasmuch as,
   by his preference of Caleb, he obscures and diminishes the praise due
   to his own minister.

   32. But the men that went up with him said. We here see, as in a
   mirror, how impiety gradually gathers audaciousness in evil. At the
   outset, the authors of the rebellion were ambiguous in their
   expressions, and contented themselves with obscure insinuations; they
   now throw aside all shame, and openly and acrimoniously oppose the
   address of Caleb, which was certainly nothing less than casting
   discredit on God's words, and setting at naught His power. God had
   promised to give the land to the Israelites; they deny that He will do
   so. He had afforded them many proofs that nothing is difficult to Him:
   they deny that His aid will suffice against the forces of their
   enemies. Moreover, they at length break out into such impudence, that
   in their falsehood they contradict themselves. They had confessed that
   the land was rich; they now declare that it consumes or devours its
   inhabitants, which is entirely the reverse. For this is equivalent to
   saying, that the wretched men, who cultivated it, wore themselves out
   with their assiduous labors; or, at ally rate, that it was pestilential
   from the inclemency of its climate; either of which statements was
   utterly false. The mode in which some understand it, viz., that the
   giants [52] in their violence committed indiscriminate slaughter, is
   without foundation; for this evil was by no means to be feared by the
   people, after the extermination of the inhabitants. I do not doubt,
   then, but that it means that the cultivation of the land was difficult,
   and full of much inconvenience.

   At the end of the last verse, where it is said, "as grasshoppers,"
   etc., I think the words are inverted, and ought to be thus connected;
   "As grasshoppers are despised in our eyes, so we were looked down upon
   by these giants on account of our lowness of stature."

   [48] Hengstenberg (Dissertations on the Genuineness of the Pentateuch,
   vol. 2, p. 344,) discusses this point, in opposition to Vater and De
   Wette, though he reminds us that "the discrepancy is no new discovery,
   but has been thoroughly canvassed; compare Gerhard on Deut., p. 53."
   "That the contradiction is only apparent (he says) is clear from
   Numbers 13:26; for, since those, to whom the answer was brought back,
   must be identical. with the persons who sent out the spies, it appears
   from this passage that. not merely Moses and Aaron, but also the
   congregation, had a share in giving the commission. The author,
   therefore, cannot intend to deny this, when, in verse 1 and 2, he
   refers the matter to God." "The sending out of the spies (he further
   argues) was a part of God's plan, and hence was expressly commanded by
   Him, as soon as its indispensable condition, the proposal on the part
   of the people, had taken place. For one thing, it would insure to the
   well-disposed a strengthening of their weak faith; on the other hand,
   it formed a part of God's design, that the evil-disposed should take
   occasion by this undertaking to manifest their unbelief, and be ripened
   by it for judgment, This design we learn from the result, which can
   never be contrary to the design. If the divine purpose was the
   essential point, and the proposal of the people the mere conditio sine
   qua non of its being carried into effect, it will be easily understood
   how the latter might be passed over in the Book of Numbers, although,
   as we have already seen, it is pre-supposed. After what has been
   remarked, Calvin's view of the mutual relation of the two passages will
   clearly appear to be the correct one."

   [49] "Afin que ce nom d'honneur servist a l'authoriser;" in order that
   this name of honor might serve to give him authority. -- Fr. Calvin
   here alludes to the apparent contradiction arising from the fact that
   Joshua had already been called by his new name in Exodus 17:9; 24:13;
   33:11; and Numbers 11:28, which, as Hengstenberg remarks, was a topic
   of discussion as early as the times of Justin Martyr. Hengstenberg
   reviews the three modes of meeting the difficulty proposed, viz., 1.
   That he was so called in the earlier passages by prolepsis. 2. That
   Moses now only renewed the name. 3. That a statement is here made of
   what had taken place a considerable time before. To this view he
   himself inclines, and says, "That the author here first mentioned that
   he, whom he had originally called simply Joshua, originally bore the
   name of Hoshea, was not without good reason. What had been hitherto
   related of Joshua, belonged to him as a servant of God; the sacred name
   was, therefore, properly employed. But here Hoshea must stand; for he
   went to spy out the land, not as a servant of Moses, but as one of the
   heads of the children of' Israel,' -- one of the plenipotentiaries of
   the congregation." -- Genuineness of Pentateuch, vol. 2, p. 323.

   because they were so tall, that those who saw them fell from terror, or
   rather falling, i.e., making to fall, (the Kal being put for the
   Hiphil,) laying prostrate and slaying other men in all directions, for
   these giants were savage men and truculent tyrants."

   Numbers 14

   Numbers 14:1-9

   1. And all the congregation lifted up their voice, and cried; and the
   people wept that night.

   1. Tunc sustulit universus coetus, edideruntque vocem suam, et flevit
   populus nocte illa.

   2. And all the children of Israel murmured against Moses and against
   Aaron; and the whole congregation said unto them, Would God that we had
   died in the land of Egypt! or, would God we had died in this
   wilderness!

   2. Et murmuraverunt adversus Mosen et adversus Aharon omnes filii
   Israel: ac dixerunt universa multitudo, Utinam mortui essemus in terra
   AEgypti: aut in deserto hoc utinam mortui essemus.

   3. And wherefore hath the Lord brought us unto this land, to fall by
   the sword, that our wives and our children should be a prey? Were it
   not better for us to return into Egypt?

   3. Et quare Jehova introducit nos in hanc terram, ut cadamus gladio,
   uxores nostrae et parvuli nostri sint in praedam? Nonne satius esset
   nobis reverti in AEgyptum?

   4. And they said one to another, Let us make a captain, and let us
   return into Egypt.

   4. Dixerunt itaque alter ad alterum, Constituamus ducem, et revertamur
   in Aegyptum.

   5. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces before all the assembly of
   the congregation of the children of Israel.

   5. Tunc cecidit Moses et Aharon super faciem suam coram universo coetu
   congregationis filiorum Israel.

   6. And Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
   were of them that searched the land, rent their clothes:

   6. Jehosua vero filius Nun, et Caleb filius Jephuneh, de exploratoribus
   terrae sciderunt vestimenta sua.

   7. And they spoke unto all the company of the children of Israel,
   saying, The land, which we passed through to search it, is an exceeding
   good land.

   7. Ac loquuti sunt ad universam congregationem filiorum Israel,
   dicendo, Terra per quam transivimus ut exploraremus eam, optima terra
   est.

   8. If the Lord delight in us, then he will bring us into this land, and
   give it us; a land which floweth with milk and honey.

   8. Si complacitum fuerit Jehovae in nobis, introducet nos in terram
   istam, tradetque eam nobis, terram quae affluit lacte et melle.

   9. Only rebel not ye against the Lord, neither fear ye the people of
   the land; for they are bread for us: their defense is departed from
   them, and the Lord is with us; fear them not.

   9. Tantum ne sitis rebelles Jehovae, neque timeatis populum terrae
   hujus: quia velut panis noster sunt, recessit praesidium eorum ab
   ipsis: Jehova autem nobiscum est, ne timeatis eos.

   1. And all the congregation lifted up their voice. Here we see how
   easily, by means of a few incentives, sedition is excited in a great
   multitude; for the people, unless governed by the counsel of others, is
   like the sea, exposed to many tempests; and the corruption of human
   nature produces this amongst innumerable other evils, that lies and
   impostures prevail over truth. There was, indeed, some pretext for the
   error of the people, in that they saw ten most choice leaders of their
   tribes dissuading them from entering the land, and only two advising
   them to proceed. But that credulity, to which they were too much
   inclined, is without excuse, because it arose from incredulity; for, if
   the dignity and reputation of ten men availed so much with them, that
   they were thus easy of belief, ought they not much rather to have given
   credit to the word of God, who had promised them the land four hundred
   years before? For when they cried out beneath the oppressive tyranny of
   the Egyptians, the memory of the promise given to their fathers was not
   effaced, since the holy Jacob had carefully provided for its
   transmission. They had recently heard and embraced its confirmation,
   and in this confidence had come forth from Egypt. We see, then, that
   they had already been induced by their own supineness and depravity to
   recoil from entering the land, because they had thrown aside their
   confidence in God, so that they might seem to have deliberately laid
   hold of the opportunity. Still the evil counselors gave an impulse to
   them, when they were falling of their accord, and east them down
   headlong.

   They begin with weeping, which at length bursts out into rage. The
   cause of their weeping is the fear of death, because they think that
   they are being carried away to slaughter; and whence does this arise,
   except because the promised aid of God is of no account with them? Thus
   it appears how greatly opposed to faith is cowardice, when, on the
   occurrence of danger, we look only to ourselves. But:. whilst the
   beginning of infidelity is to be withheld by fear from obedience to
   God, so another worse evil presently follows, when men obstinately
   resist God, and, because they are unwilling to submit themselves to His
   word, enter into altercation with Him. This was the case with the
   Israelites, who, being overwhelmed with grief, at length are stirred up
   by its impetuosity against Moses and Aaron. And this is wont too often
   to occur, that impatience bursts forth from the anguish into which our
   unbelief has brought us. The desire for death, which they conceive,
   arises from ingratitude and contempt of God's blessing. They wished
   that they had died either in Egypt or in the wilderness; why, then, had
   they just before humbly beseeched Moses to propitiate God?

   With regard to the words, the old interpreter, [53] taking the particle
   lv, which is optative, for the negative (l', lo,) improperly translates
   the passage, as if their death in the desert would have been more
   bitter than in Egypt; whereas they only deplore that they would be
   exposed to death if they should enter the land of Canaan, as follows in
   the next verse.

   3. And wherefore has the Lord brought us into this land? The pride, and
   even the madness of their impiety here more fully betrays itself, when
   they accuse God of deception and cruelty, as if tie were betraying them
   to the Canaanitish nations, and leading them forth to slaughter; for
   they conclude that they ought not to obey His command, because He would
   destroy them, and not only so, but that He would at the same time give
   their wives and children to be a prey. We see how mad is unbelief, when
   it gives way to itself, since these wretched people do not hesitate to
   prefer charges against God, and to repay His kindnesses by calling Him
   their betrayer. But what was the cause of this blasphemous audacity,
   [54] except that they hear they would have to do with powerful enemies?
   as if they had not experienced the might of God to be such, that
   nothing which they might encounter was to be feared whilst He was on
   their side! At the same time, they also accuse God of weakness, as if
   He were less powerful than the nations of Canaan. At length their
   monstrous blindness and senselessness comes to its climax, when they
   consult as to their return, and, rejecting Moses, set themselves about
   choosing a leader, who may again deliver them up to Pharaoh. Were they
   so quickly forgetful how wretched their condition there had been? It
   was for no fault of theirs, but whilst they were peaceful and harmless
   guests, that the Egyptians had so cruelly afflicted them, since they
   were hated by Pharaoh on no other account but because he could not
   endure their multitude; what, then, was he likely to do, when, for
   their sakes, he had undergone so many calamities; what humanity, again,
   was to be expected from that nation which had conspired for their
   destruction already, when it had suffered no injury from them? Surely
   there was no house among them which would not long to avenge its
   first-born! Yet they desire to give themselves up to the will of a most
   bitter enemy, who, without any cause for ill-will, had proceeded to all
   sorts of extremities against them. Hence we plainly see that
   unbelievers are not only blinded by the just vengeance of God, but
   carried away by a spirit of infatuation, so as to inflict upon
   themselves the greatest evils.

   5. Then Moses and Aaron fell on their faces. It is doubtful whether
   they so humbled themselves towards the people, as to he prostrate
   before them, or whether it was in prayer that they fell with their
   faces on the earth; the latter, however, seems more likely to me, as
   if, by thus turning themselves to God, they reproved the stupidity of
   the people,. And, in fact, in such a case of obduracy, nothing remained
   except to call upon God, yet in such sort that the prayer should be
   made in the sight of all, in order to influence their minds. Otherwise
   they might have sought some place of retirement; but by this pitiful
   spectacle they endeavored to recall the people to their right senses.
   This, indeed, is beyond dispute, that they sought for nothing on their
   own account, but were only anxious for the welfare of the people;
   since, if the people had gone back, they would have been at liberty to
   sojourn in the land of Canaan, or elsewhere. Yet still they were not
   merely concerned with regard to the people, but the interruption of
   God's grace troubled them most, with which the Covenant made with
   Abraham would also have been buried. In a word, this was justly felt by
   them to be the same as if they had seen both the glory of God and the
   salvation of the human race altogether brought to naught. Wherefore
   they must needs have been more than senseless who were unmoved by this
   sad sight, especially when Moses, whom God had exalted by so many
   privileges above all other mortals, was lying prostrate on the earth
   for their sake.

   6. And Joshua, the son of Nun, and Caleb. The magnanimity of Joshua is
   here specified, whereas, before, only Caleb had been praised. But Moses
   says that they both rent their clothes in token of their excessive
   sorrow, and even of their abhorrence. For, as is well known, this,
   amongst the Orientals, was a solemn ceremony in extreme grief, or when
   they would express their abomination of some crime. Hypocrites have
   improperly imitated this custom, either when they made a pretence of
   sorrow, or desired to deceive the simple. But it is plain that Caleb
   and Joshua were moved to rend their garments by solemn feelings, nay,
   by the fervor of their indignation; whilst, at the same time, they seek
   to reclaim the people from their madness. And, first, they commend the
   fertility of the land; and then base their hope of obtaining it on the
   favor or good pleasure of God. Some take the conditional particle 'm,
   im, for the causal particle, and translate it, "For because God loves
   us, therefore He will bring us in;" but this I do not approve of, and
   it is manifestly foreign to the true meaning; for, since the Israelites
   had in a manner rejected so great a benefit, they were surely unworthy
   through unbelief of being still pursued by His favor. The condition is,
   therefore, introduced as if doubtingly, not in order to diminish their
   hopes, as though it were a mark of uncertainty, but simply that the
   people should be convinced of their impiety, and repent; as if they had
   said, If only we afford room for the continuance of God's favor towards
   us, be ye of good courage. And this they state more clearly soon
   afterwards, in reproving the stubbornness of the people, where they
   say, "Only (or but) rebel not ye;" in which words they admonish them
   that they shut up all the ways whereby God might still pursue the
   course of His work; [55] and that there is no other obstacle to these
   wretched people except their own unbelief, which does not permit them
   to obey God. In this way, then, they assert that God's power is
   sufficient to perform what He had promised; and then exhort the people
   to conciliate His favor, from whence they had fallen through their own
   fault. The particle 'k, ac, is used emphatically, as though Joshua and
   Caleb had said that there was no fear of danger, except because the
   people's minds were set on bringing evil upon themselves. Finally, in
   their reliance upon God's aid, they exult like conquerors; "They will
   be bread for us," they say, i.e., we shall devour them without any
   trouble. And the reason is subjoined, because, if God stands by the
   Israelites, their enemies will be destitute of all defense. Justly,
   then, and for the best of reasons they conclude, that although our
   enemies would otherwise be formidable, they are not to be feared, if
   only God, apart from whom there is no strength, be favorable unto us.

   The Repetition of the same Narrative

   Deuteronomy 1

   Deuteronomy 1:26-33

   26. Notwithstanding ye would not go up, but rebelled against the
   commandment of the Lord your God:

   26. Et tamen noluistis ascendere, sed rebellastis verbo Jehovae Dei
   vestri.

   27. And ye murmured in your tents, and said, Because the Lord hated us,
   he hath brought us forth out of the land of Egypt, to deliver us into
   the hand of the Amorites, to destroy us.

   27. Et murmurastis in tabernaculis vestris dicentes, Propterea quod
   odio habebat nos Jehova, eduxit nos e terra AEgypti, ut traderet nos in
   manum Emorrhaei, ut perderet nos.

   28. Whither shall we go up? our brethren have discouraged our heart,
   saying, The people is greater and taller than we; the cities are great,
   and walled up to heaven: and, moreover, we have seen the sons of the
   Anakims there.

   28. Quo nos ascendimus? fratres nostri dissolverunt cor nostrum,
   dicendo, Populus iste major et procerior nobis est, urbes magnae et
   munitae usque ad coelum: et etiam filios gigantum vidimus ibi.

   29. Then I said unto you, Dread not, neither be afraid of them.

   29. Tunc dixi vobis, Ne pavearis neque timeatis ab eis:

   30. The Lord your God, which goeth before you, he shall fight for you,
   according to all that he did for you in Egypt before your eyes;

   30. Jehova Deus vester qui praecedit vos, ipse pugnabit pro vobis,
   prorsus ut fecit vobiscum in AEgypto in oculis vestris.

   31. And in the wilderness, where thou hast seen how that the Lord thy
   God bare thee, as a man doth bear his son, in all the way that ye went,
   until ye came into this place.

   31. Et in ipso deserto vidistis quod portaverit Jehova Deus tuus,
   quemadmodum portare solet homo filium suum, et hoc per totam viam per
   quam ambulastis, donec veneritis ad locum istum.

   32. Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord your God,

   32. Atqui ea in re non credidistis Jehovae Deo vestro,

   33. Who went in the way before you, to search you out a place to pitch
   your tents in, in fire by night, to show you by what way ye should go,
   and in a cloud by day.

   33. Qui praecedebat vos per viam ad explorandum vobis locum in quo
   castra figeretis, per ignem in nocte, ut ostenderet vobis viam per quam
   ambularetis, et per nubem in die.

   27. And ye murmured in your tents. Elsewhere he says that they also
   wept; here he only speaks of their murmuring, which better suited his
   reproof. He then reminds them how malignant had been their ingratitude
   and perversity in upbraiding God on account of the special blessing
   which He had conferred upon them, as if He had done them a grievous
   injury. He could not have afforded them a more manifest proof of His
   paternal love towards them than by their deliverance. Most iniquitous,
   therefore, is their mode of repaying Him, viz., by complaining that
   they had been cruelly brought forth to die, and by construing into
   hatred His exceeding great love. It is clear from the next verse that,
   although Moses does not relate the details in their proper order, there
   is still no contradiction in his words. A little before, he had seemed
   to give unqualified praise to the spies, as if they had performed their
   office honestly and faithfully, but now, from the language of the
   people, he shows that they were the authors of the revolt, inasmuch as
   they rendered inert, by the terror they inspired, those whom they ought
   to have encouraged.

   29. Then I said unto you, Dread not. He here omits the address of Caleb
   and Joshua: since he only states briefly the heads of what he had
   spoken to the people. He merely shows that, when he endeavored to
   recall them to their right senses, his efforts and pains were
   ineffectual. Moreover, he reasons from experience that they might well
   place their hopes in the assistance of God, because He went before them
   as a light; and, in proof of this, he reminds them that, after the
   discomfiture of the Egyptians, He did not fail still to exert His
   power, so as to protect even to the end those whom He had once
   delivered. This, then, is his proposition, that although they might be
   aware of their own weakness, still, through the power of God, they
   would be conquerors, since He had taken them under His care, and had
   declared Himself their leader; which he indicates by the expression,
   "goes before you." And, lest any hesitation should remain, he sets
   against their present obstacles the miracles of God's power, which they
   had experienced, not only in the commencement of their redemption, but
   in the continued progress of their deliverance's, when, in their lost
   and desperate state, He had by ways innumerable restored them from
   death unto life. Hence he concludes that they ought not to be afraid,
   not that he would wish them to be altogether free from all fear and
   care, but so that they might overcome all hindrances, when confidence
   derived from the ready help of God should prevail in their hearts. He
   says emphatically that God had fought "before their eyes," to lead them
   to fuller conviction by the evidence of their own senses.

   31. And it, the wilderness where thou hast seen. The constant course of
   God's grace is here commemorated; from whence they might safely infer,
   that He, who had pursued them with so many benefits, would still be the
   same in this crowning act. He, therefore, uses the image of bearing,
   because the way would have been by no means passable unless God had
   borne them, as it were, on His shoulders, just as a father is wont to
   bear his infant child. Thus, on the one hand, the incredible goodness
   of God is exalted, who had deigned so far to condescend as to take up
   the people in His arms; and, on the other hand, the people are reminded
   of their own infirmity, for, unless upheld by the power of God, they
   would scarcely have been competent to advance a step. Elsewhere,
   retaining a portion of this similitude, Moses compares God to an eagle,
   [56] who bears her young upon her wings, and teaches them to fly. And
   surely, unless (the Israelites) had been uplifted by supernatural
   means, they would never have been equal to a hundredth part of the
   difficulties they encountered.

   32. Yet in this thing ye did not believe the Lord. He signifies that
   they had been most prejudiced observers of the works of God, since His
   power, so often experienced and. so thoroughly understood, had not
   aroused them to confidence in Him. For in the word dvr, dabar, which we
   have translated thing, he embraces all the proofs whereby God had
   testified, that in Him alone there was all that was necessary to insure
   their complete salvation. And this was, so to speak, real or practical
   doctrine, when God called upon them to trust Him by stretching forth
   His hand. Still, He accuses them of unbelief with reference to the
   promise; for, whilst faith is not only prompt and ready in obedience,
   but invigorates and quickens the whole mall, so the cause of their
   inertness was that they gave no heed to God who had promised to bestow
   upon them the land of Canaan, and did not rest upon His covenant. In
   relation to this also, he says, that God marked out the places and
   stations where they should pitch their camp, for, unless it had been
   His design to guide them onwards, this change of places would have been
   superfluous. It was, therefore, gross supineness not to refer these
   signs for halting and proceeding to their proper object, since it was
   equivalent to despising God when He held out His hand to them.

   Numbers 14:10-38

   10. But all the congregation bade stone them with stones. And the glory
   of the Lord appeared in the tabernacle of the congregation before all
   the children of Israel.

   10. Tunc dixit tota multitudo, ut eos lapidibus obruerent: et gloria
   Jehovae apparuit in tabernaculo conventionis omnibus filiis Israel.

   11. And the Lord said unto Moses, How long will this people provoke.
   me? and how long will it be ere they believe me, for all the signs
   which! have showed among them?

   11. Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Usquequo vilipendet me populus iste? et
   usquequo non credent mihi in cunctis signis quae feci in medio eorum?

   12. I will smite them with the pestilence, and disinherit them, and
   will make of thee a greater nation and mightier than they.

   12. Percutiam cum peste, expellamque eum: te autem faciam in gentem
   magnam et robustiorem eo.

   13. And Moses said unto the Lord, Then the Egyptians shall hear it;
   (for thou broughtest up this people in thy might from among them;)

   13. Et dixit Moses ad Jehovam, Atqui audient AEgyptii (quia eduxisti in
   virtute tua populum istum e medio ejus:)

   14. And they will tell it to the inhabitants of this land: for they
   have heard that thou, Lord, art among this people; that thou, Lord, art
   seen face to face; and that thy cloud standeth over them; and that thou
   goest before them, by day-time in a pillar of a cloud, and in a pillar
   of fire by night.

   14. Dicentque habitatori terrae ejus, qui audierunt quod tu Jehova sis,
   in medio hujus populi: quandoquidem oculo ad oculum visus sis tu
   Jehova: et nubes tua steterit super eos, et in columna nubis
   praecesseris eos per diem, et in columna ignis per noctem.

   15. Now, if thou shalt kill all this people as one man, then the
   nations, which have heard the fame of thee, will speak, saying,

   15. Si interfeceris populum hunc quasi virum unum, tunc dicent gentes
   quae audierint famam tuam.

   16. Because the Lord was not able to bring this people into the land
   which he swore unto them, therefore he hath slain them in the
   wilderness.

   16. Quia absque potentia est Jehova, ut introducat populum istum in
   terram, quam juravit eis, ideo mactavit eos in deserto.

   17. And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great,
   according as thou hast spoken, saying,

   17. Et nunc magnificetur quaeso fortitudo Domini mei, sicut loquutus
   es, dicens:

   18. The Lord is long-suffering, and of great mercy, forgiving iniquity
   and transgression, and by no means clearing the guilty; visiting the
   iniquity of the fathers upon the children unto the third and fourth
   generation.

   18. Jehova tardus ad iram, et multae misericordiae, tollens iniquitatem
   et peccatum, et innocentem non faciens: visitans iniquitatem patrum in
   filios super tertiam et quartam generationem.

   19. Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people, according unto
   the greatness of thy mercy, and as thou hast forgiven this people, from
   Egypt even until now.

   19. Propitius esto agedum iniquitati populi hujus, secundum
   magnitudinem clementiae tuae, sicut remisisti populo huic ex AEgypto
   usque nunc.

   20. And the Lord said, I have pardoned, according to thy word:

   20. Tune dixit Jehova, Peperci secundum sermonem tuum.

   21. But as truly as I live, all the earth shall be filled with the
   glory of the Lord.

   21. Veruntamen vivo ego, et replebit gloria mea universam terram.

   22. Because all those men which have seen my glory, and my miracles
   which I did in Egypt, and in the wilderness, have tempted me now these
   ten times, and have not hearkened to my voice;

   22. Quoad cunctos homines qui viderunt gloriam meam, et signa mea quae
   edidi in AEgypto, et deserto, et tentaverunt me jam decem vicibus, nec
   paruerunt voci meae:

   23. Surely they shall not see the land which I swore unto their
   fathers, neither shall any of them that provoked me see it:

   23. Si videbunt terram, de qua juravi patribus eorum, omnes, inquam,
   qui me irritaverunt, non videbunt eam.

   24. But my servant Caleb, because he had another spirit with him, and
   hath followed me fully, him will I bring into the land whereunto he
   went; and his seed shall possess it.

   24. At servum meum Caleb, eo quod alius fuit spiritus cum eo, et
   adimplevit ire post me, ipsum quoque introducam in terram quam
   ingressus est, et semen ejus haereditate accipiet eam.

   25. (Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites dwelt in the valley.)
   Tomorrow turn you, and get you into the wilderness, by the way of the
   Red sea.

   25. Amalec et Chananaeus habitat in valle: cras revertimini et
   proficiscimini in desertum via maris Suph.

   26. And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   26. Loquutus est itaque Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon, dicendo:

   27. How long shall I bear with this evil congregation, which murmur
   against me? I have heard the murmurings of the children of Israel,
   which they murmur against me.

   27. Usque quo congregationem hanc perversam feram, quae murmurat
   adversum me? murmurationes filiorum Israel, quibus ipsi murmurant
   contra me, audivi.

   28. Say unto them, As truly as I live, saith the Lord, as ye have
   spoken in mine ears, so will I do to you:

   28. Dic ergo eis, Vivo ego, dicit Jehova, nisi quemadmodum loquuti
   estis in auribus meis sic fecero vobis.

   29. Your carcasses shall fall in this wilderness; and all that were
   numbered of you, according to your whole number, from twenty years old
   and upward, which have murmured against me,

   29. In deserto isto cadent cadavera vestra, et omnes numerati vestri,
   secundum omnem numerum vestrum, a filio viginti annorum et supra, qui
   murmurastis contra me.

   30. Doubtless ye shall not come into the land concerning which I swore
   to make you dwell therein, save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, and Joshua
   the son of Nun.

   30. Si vos ingrediemini terram de qua levavi manum meam, ut habitare
   vos facerem in ea: praeter Caleb filium Jephuneh, et Jehosua filium
   Nun.

   31. But your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, them will I
   bring in, and they shall know the land which ye have despised.

   31. Ac parvulos vestros, de quibus dixistis, In praedam erunt, ipsos
   introducam: et cognoscent terram istam quam despexistis.

   32. But as for you, your carcasses, they shall fall in this wilderness.

   32. Cadavera autem vestra cadent in deserto hoc.

   33. And your children shall wander in the wilderness forty years, and
   bear your whoredoms, until your carcasses be wasted in the wilderness.

   33. Et filii vestri pastores erunt in deserto hoc quadraginta annis: et
   portabunt scortationes vestras donec consumantur cadavera vestra in
   deserto.

   34. After the number of the days in which ye searched the land, even
   forty days, (each day for a year,) shall ye bear your iniquities, even
   forty years; and ye shall know my breach of promise.

   34. Secundum numerum dierum quibus explorastis terram quadraginta
   diebus, unoquoque die pro anno uno, portabitis iniquitates vestras in
   deserto, et cognoscetis vanitatem meam.

   35. I the Lord have said, I will surely do it unto all this evil
   congregation, that are gathered together against me: in this wilderness
   they shall be consumed, and there they shall die.

   35. Ego Jehova loquutus sum, Si non hoc fecero universae congregationi
   huic perversae, quae congregata est adversum me, in deserto isto
   consumentur, ibique morientur.

   36. And the men which Moses sent to search the land, who returned, and
   made all the congregation to murmur against him, by bringing up a
   slander upon the land,

   36. Viri itaque illi quos miserat Moses ad explorandam terram, qui
   reversi murmurare fecerant adversus eum cunctam congregationem,
   detrahendo terrae:

   37. Even those men that did bring up the evil report upon the land,
   died by the plague before the Lord.

   37. Morientur viri illi qui terrae detraxerunt, plaga coram Jehova.

   38. But Joshua the son of Nun, and Caleb the son of Jephunneh, which
   were of the men that went to search the land, lived still,

   38. Jehosua vero filius Nun, et Caleb filius Jephuneh vivent, ex
   hominibus illis qui profecti sunt ad explorandam terram.

   10. But all the congregation bade stone them. When these wicked men
   began by murmuring against God, and openly casting censure upon Him, no
   wonder that they should also rage against His servants; for, when we
   endeavor to subdue pride, it generally begets cruelty; and so also,
   when iniquity is reproved, it always ends at last in fury. Caleb and
   Joshua did not constrain them by force of arms, neither did they menace
   them; but only persuaded them to trust in God's promise, and not to
   hesitate to advance into the land of Canaan; yet, because in their
   obstinacy the people had determined not to believe God, they champ the
   bit, as it were, upon being chastised, and desire to stone their
   reprovers. How great was the impetuosity of their wrath is manifest
   from this, that God does not attempt to appease their fury, nor to
   restrain them by threats, or by His authority, but openly displays His
   power from heaven, and miraculously protects His servants by the
   manifestation of His glory, as if He were rescuing them from wild
   beasts. There is, indeed, no express mention made of the cloud, but we
   may infer that the sign to which they were accustomed, was given not
   merely to terrify them, but also to cast them prostrate, so that they
   might be deprived of their power to inflict injury, and might desist
   even against their wills. For the majesty of God, although it truly
   humbles believers only, yet sometimes subdues the reprobate and the
   lost, or renders them astounded in all their ferocity.

   11. And the Lord said unto Moses. God remonstrates with respect to
   their indomitable obstinacy, because they had just now hesitated not
   petulantly to despise and reject Him with the most atrocious insults,
   and notwithstanding all the clearest manifestations of His power. For I
   know not whether the sense which some give be suitable, when they
   translate the verb n'ph, naatz, "to provoke." [57] Jerome comes nearer
   to the genuine sense, How long will they detract me? But let us be
   contented with the genuine intention of God, which He confirms by the
   succeeding antithesis, where He complains that He is disparaged,
   because they do not take into consideration the many miracles whereby
   He had abundantly testified His power and loving-kindness; and thus He
   proves their contempt, because they deliberately refuse credit to the
   many signs of which the accumulation at least ought to have subdued or
   corrected their stubbornness.

   The denunciation of their final punishment follows, together with a
   statement of the atrocity of their crime; for the particle "How long"
   indicates its long continuance, as well as the enduring patience of
   God. He had, indeed, punished others severely, but only for example's
   sake, in order that the name of their race should remain undestroyed,
   whereas he now declares that He will deal with them as. with persons in
   a desperate condition, who cease not to make a mock of His patience.
   Hence we are taught, that, although God is placable in His nature,
   still the hope of pardon is deservedly cut off from unbelievers, who
   are so obdurate as that tie produces no effect upon them by His hand,
   or by His countenance, or His word. he then briefly adverts to the use
   of the signs, viz., that their object was, that the knowledge or
   experience of them should awaken hopes of success.

   If the apparent contradiction offends any one, that God should declare
   the people to be cast off, when it was already decreed that tie would
   pardon them, a reply may be sought from elsewhere in three words; for
   God does not here speak of His secret and incomprehensible counsel, but
   only of the actual circumstances, showing what the people had deserved,
   and how horrible was the vengeance which impended, [58] in respect to
   their wicked and detestable revolt, since it was not His design to keep
   Moses back from earnest prayer, but to put the sincerity of his piety
   and the fervency of his zeal to the proof. And, in fact, he does not
   contravene the prohibition, except upon the previous exhibition of some
   spark of faith. See Exodus 32.

   13. Then the Egyptians shall hear it. Moses here, according to his
   custom, stands "in the breach" of the wall, as it is said in Psalm
   106:23, to sustain and avert the anger of God, which else would burst
   forth, since through his intercession it came to pass that the fire was
   speedily extinguished, and the people were not consumed. In order to
   support his request., he only objects that God's holy namo would be the
   sport of the wicked, if the people should perish altogether I have
   endeavored to reduce to their proper meaning the words which
   translators variously render. First, he says, "The Egyptians shall
   hear, whereas it is a thing sufficiently notorious, and testified by
   miracles, that this people was rescued from among them by thy might.
   The same report will also obtain currency among; the nations of Canaan,
   who have already heard that thou: art the protector of this people, and
   have undertaken the charge of governing them. If, therefore, they
   should altogether perish, all the nations which have heard of thy fame
   will east the blame on thee, and will think that thy power is broken
   down in the midst of its course, so that thou could not carry through
   to the end the work thou hadst undertaken." The substance amounts to
   this, that because God had manifested by clear and evident signs that
   He was the deliverer of this people, He would be exposed to the
   reproach of the wicked, unless He should preserve in safety those whom
   He had once redeemed. For nothing else would occur to the minds of the
   heathen nations, except that God was unable to maintain His blessing,
   however desirous He might be to do so. And assuredly this is no
   ordinary effect of God's goodness, so to connect the glory of His name
   with our salvation, that whatever is adverse to us brings with it
   reproach upon Him, because the mouth of the wicked will be open to
   blaspheme. And this will in fact turn to our advantage, if on our part,
   without dissimulation, and in zealous sincerity, we beseech God to
   uphold His own glory in saving us; for many boldly plead the name of
   God in their own behalf, although they are unaffected by any real care
   or love for it. Moreover, because the more illustrious God's exercise
   of His power has been, the more insolently are the ungodly disposed to
   blaspheme, if it has appeared to fail; we must always entreat of Him
   that He should not desert the work of His hands which He has begun in
   us. To this effect are the words, "They have heard that thou art seen
   face to face;" for, if the people's safety were not maintained, the
   failure would have been imputed to none but God, who had put. forth the
   power of His hand to preserve them. In fine, since their astonishing
   exodus had been a testimony of God's favor, so, if he had suffered the
   people to perish in the desert, all would have considered it a sign of
   His weakness, inasmuch as it was not probable that He should not
   accomplish what tie desired, unless He were unable to do so.

   17. And now, I beseech thee, let the power of my Lord be great. He
   derives another ground of confidence from the vision, in which God had
   more clearly manifested His nature, from whence it appears how much he
   had profited by it, and what earnest and anxious attention he had paid
   to it. Hence, however, we derive a general piece of instruction, that
   there is nothing more efficacious in our prayers than to set His own
   word before God, and then to found our supplications upon His promises,
   as if He dictated to us out of His own mouth what we were to ask.
   Since, then, God had manifested Himself to Moses in that memorable
   declaration, which we have already considered, he was able to derive
   from thence a sure directory for prayer; for nothing can be more sure
   than His own word, on which if our prayers are based, there is no
   reason to fear that they will be ineffectual, or that their results
   should disappoint us, since He who has spoken will prove Himself to be
   true. And, in fact, this is the reason why He speaks, viz., to afford
   us the grounds for addressing Him, for else we must needs be dumb.

   Since I have expounded the 18th verse elsewhere, [59] let my readers
   refer to that place.

   19. Pardon, I beseech thee, the iniquity of this people. In order to
   encourage his hope of pardon, he first sets before himself the
   greatness of God's mercy, and then the past instances by which it had
   been proved that God was inclined to forgiveness. And, indeed, the
   mercy of God continually invites us to seek reconciliation whenever we
   have sinned; and, though iniquities heaped upon iniquities, and the
   very enormity of our sins, might justly make us afraid, still the
   abundance of His grace, of which mention is here made, must needs occur
   to us, so as to swallow up all dread of His wrath. David, also,
   betaking himself to this refuge, affords us an example how all alarm is
   to be overcome. (Psalm 51:1) But, since the bare and abstract
   recognition of God's goodness is often insufficient for us, Moses
   applies another stay in the shape of experience: Pardon, (he says,) as
   thou hast so often done before. For, since the goodness of God is
   unwearied and inexhaustible, the oftener we have experienced it, the
   more ought we to be encouraged to implore it; not that we may sink into
   the licentious indulgence of sin, but lest despair should overwhelm us,
   when we are lying under the condemnation of God, and our own conscience
   smites and torments us. In a word, let us regard this as a most
   effective mode of importunity, when we beseech God by the benefits
   which we have already experienced, that He will never cease to be
   gracious.

   20. And the Lord said, I have pardoned, according to thy word. God
   signifies that tie pardons for His servant Moses' sake, and makes, as
   it were, a present to him of those whom He had already devoted to
   destruction. Hence we gather how much the entreaties of the pious avail
   with God: as He is said, in Psalm 145:19, to "fulfil the desire of them
   that fear him." He would, indeed, have done of His own accord what He
   granted to Moses; but, in order that we may be more earnest in prayer,
   the use and advantage of prayers is commended, when God declares that
   He will not only comply with our requests, but even obey them.

   But how is it consistent for Him to declare that He had spared those,
   upon whom He had determined to inflict the most extreme punishment, and
   whom He deprived of their promised inheritance? I reply that the pardon
   in question was not granted to the individuals, but to their race and
   name. For the opinion of some is unnatural, who think that they were
   released from the penalty of eternal death, and thence that God was
   propitiated towards them, because He was contented with their temporal
   punishment. I do not doubt, then, but that Moses was so far heard, as
   that the seed of Abraham should not be destroyed, and the covenant of
   God should not fail For He so dispensed the pardon as to preserve their
   posterity uninjured, whilst He inflicted on the unbelievers themselves
   the reward of their rebellion. Thus the conditions of the pardon were
   of no advantage to the impious rebels, though they opened a way for the
   faithful fulfillment of His promise.

   21. But as truly as I live, all the earth. It is, indeed, plain that
   God here swears by His life and glory: the meaning is only ambiguous in
   this respect, that some translate it in the past tense, that the earth
   had been filled with His glory, which had already been displayed in so
   many miracles. And this seems to accord well with what follows, "Those,
   who have seen my glory -- shall not see the land;" still the future
   tense suits the context better, viz., that God should call to witness
   His glory, which He will hereafter assert. Moses feared lest the
   destruction of the people should be turned into a reproach and
   contumely against God; God now declares with an oath that He would so
   vindicate His glory, as that those, who were guilty of so great a
   crime, should not escape punishment. He proclaims that those should not
   see the land, who had shut their eyes against the miracles, of which
   they had been spectators and eye-witnesses, and in their blindness had
   endeavored to set them at naught. For, inasmuch as they had not been
   taught to fear God by so many signs, they were worse than unworthy of
   beholding the land, the possession of which ought to have been assured
   to them by those very signs, if God's truth had not been utterly
   rejected by their ingratitude.

   God complains that He had been "tempted" by them "ten times;" because
   they had not ceased constantly to provoke Him by their frowardness; for
   it is no fixed or definite number, which is intended, but God would
   merely indicate that they had done so without measure or end. We have
   elsewhere [60] shown what it is to tempt God, viz., to subject His
   power to the narrow rule of our own senses, and to prescribe to Him the
   mode in which He is to act, according to our own desires: so as to
   defer to Him no further than our carnal reason dictates. The source and
   cause of this tempting of God is subjoined, i.e., when men refuse to
   listen to His voice; since nothing but obedience, which is the mistress
   of humility, can restrain our insolence.

   24. But my servant Caleb. By synecdoche Caleb alone is now excepted,
   although Joshua was a partaker of the same grace, as he had been also a
   sharer in his courageous conduct; but Caleb is especially
   distinguished, because he had, as it were, uplifted the banner, and had
   stood forth first to encourage Joshua, The sum of his praise is that he
   "fulfilled [61] to go after God." The word "will," which some
   understand, is superfluous, since the expression is complete without
   any addition. God, therefore, commends Caleb's perseverance in obeying;
   because he not only promptly exhorted the others, but also proceeded
   boldly and unhesitatingly, without being deterred by any obstacles.
   God, however, magnifies his perseverance, because he looked to Him
   alone in his noble conflict with so great a multitude. For it is an
   extraordinary case for a person to stand firm, and to hold a straight
   course in the midst of violent and tempestuous disturbances, when all
   the world is, as it were, convulsed. Although the word rvch, ruach,
   [62] is sometimes used for the disposition of the mind, yet I have no
   doubt but that Moses signifies, by metonymy, that Caleb was thus
   influenced by divine inspiration.

   25. Now the Amalekites and the Canaanites. Some thus resolve these
   words; "Although the Amalekites dwell in the valley;" and others thus:
   "Since the Amalekites abide in the valleys to lay ambuscades." Others
   think that their object is to inspire terror, lest the Israelites
   should remain too long in the enemy's country, since they would be
   daily exposed to fresh attacks. I am, however, rather of opinion that
   they are spoken in reproach. For they had already arrived at the
   borders of the inhabited land, so that their enemies might be put to
   the rout at once: whereas God commands them to retire, and thus expels
   them from the land, which they had actually reached. Still I do not
   deny that He sets before them the necessity of the case, and thus
   enforces their obedience; as if He had said, that nothing now remained
   but to retreat, and again to throw themselves into the desert.

   26. And the Lord spoke unto Moses. [63] I have translated the copula by
   the word itaque (therefore,) to indicate the connection with what
   precedes: for Moses does not here recount anything new, but, by way of
   explanation, repeats a point of great importance, viz., that they, who
   had refused to enter the land, would be deprived of its possession. He
   begins with the passionate interrogation: [64] "How long shall this
   troublesome dregs of a people be borne with, who never cease to murmur
   against me?" And God says that He "had heard" their turbulent cries; in
   order that they might more certainly perceive that their pride was
   intolerable, since God Himself was weary of it, although He is
   long-suffering and slow to anger. It is in bitter irony that He says He
   will deal with them in accordance with their own resolution and desire.
   Nothing, indeed, was further from their intention than to wander in the
   wilderness, but, since they had held back from entering the land, God
   says that He will gratify them in a very different sense, viz., that
   they shall never enjoy the sight of that land, which they had despised.
   By His oath, He expresses His extreme wrath, as also it is said in
   Psalm 95:11,

   "Unto whom I swore in my wrath, that they
   shall not enter into my rest." [65]

   It was necessary that their stolidity should be thus aroused, lest,
   when God was so greatly provoked, they should still continue
   self-satisfied, according to their went. He aggravates their punishment
   by another circumstance, i.e., that, they were to be deprived of the
   inheritance which He had sworn to give to Abraham; for the lifting up
   of the hand [66] (as I have said elsewhere) was a form of oath; just as
   if God were called down from heaven by the outstretched hand to be
   witness and judge: and, although this does not indeed literally apply
   to God, still we know that He commonly transfers to Himself the things
   that belong to men. Moreover, this was a most severe reproof, that they
   by their wickedness and self-will should nullify a promise, which God
   had ratified by an oath, in so far, at least, as its fulfillment
   affected themselves: for He points out immediately afterwards that,
   although they had rejected the proffered blessing, he would still be
   true; and would bestow on their little ones that which they had refused
   for themselves. It is thus that God tempers His judgments against those
   hypocrites, who falsely profess to honor His name, so as to preserve a
   seed for the propagation of His Church: nor is He ever so severe
   towards the reprobate, as to fail in sustaining His mercy towards His
   elect. Nay, He here declares that Hie will be gracious towards their
   children, as a means of inflicting punishment on the fathers. It was an
   indirect accusation of God, when they lamented over their children, as
   if they were to be carried away as "a prey;" whereas, God promises that
   they shall be the possessors of the land, in order to reprove this
   wicked blasphemy.

   33. And your children shall wander in the wilderness. [67] He here
   pronounces that their children shall be in some measure partakers of
   their punishment, inasmuch as they shall wander in the desert until the
   time prescribed: for by the word shepherds, He means sojourners, [68]
   who have no certain or settled residence. To this effect is the
   similitude in the song of Hezekiah:

   "My lodging is departed as a shepherd's tent." [69]
   (Isaiah 38:12.)

   In short, He declares that they shall be wandering and unsettled, and
   lead a life, like shepherds conducting their flocks from place to
   place.

   He calls the wicked rebellions, whereby they had corrupted themselves,
   metaphorically "whoredoms;" for, from the time that God had espoused
   them to Himself, their true chastity would have been to embrace His
   grace in sincere faith, and at the same time to devote themselves to
   His service; but by rejecting tits pure worship, they had broken their
   sacred marriage-vow like gadding harlots.

   This example teaches us how God visits the iniquities of the fathers on
   their children, and yet chastises no one undeservedly; since the
   descendants here referred to, [70] although atoning for the fault of
   others, were still by no means innocent themselves. But in the
   judgments of God there is always a deep abyss, into which if you fear
   to be plunged, adore that which it is not lawful to question.
   Nevertheless, there is no doubt but that thus also God provided for the
   welfare of those, towards whom He appeared to show some marks of
   severity. For He waited not only until they had grown up, but also, as
   was advantageous to themselves, until they had attained the strength of
   manhood, and until a new generation had sprung up. He assigns a second
   reason why He postponed the fulfillment of His promise for forty years,
   viz., that tie might repay the ill-spent days by as many years. Having,
   then, spoken of their children, He again returns to the actual
   criminals themselves, who were to be consumed in all that long period
   of time, as if by a lingering disease. The noun tnv't, tenuoth, which I
   have rendered vanity, [71] is derived from the verb nv', nu, which
   signifies to render ineffectual. Translators, however, extract from it
   various meanings. Some thus construe it: Ye shall know whether I am
   false, or whether my word shall be vain. Others, rendering it
   prohibition, depart more widely from the sense. But, in my judgment, it
   is an ironical concession, whereby God reproves their detestable pride,
   which had no other object than to accuse God of falsehood, and to
   charge Him calumniously with failing to fulfil His words. Unless, [72]
   perhaps, it should be preferred to take it passively; because the
   people had endeavored to annihilate, as it were, God himself. But still
   I rather adopt this sense, that they should perceive by certain and
   experimental proof, whether God's promises were frivolous or vain.
   Moreover, we must bear in mind the admonition of the Prophet, to which
   I have referred, (Psalm 95:11,) and which the Apostle adapts to our
   present use, (Hebrews 4:6,) viz., that a better rest is now offered to
   us, from which we are to fear lest our unbelief should withhold us. For
   it is not sufficient for us that God's hand should once have been
   extended to us, unless we allow ourselves to be directed by it, until
   our earthly wanderings are concluded, and it conducts us into our
   heavenly rest.

   36. And the men, which Moses sent to search the land. I do not at all
   approve of the view which some take, that this is recorded by
   anticipation; for there is no question but that Moses recounts the
   special punishment which was inflicted by God upon the perfidious
   spies. He had previously treated of the general punishment of the whole
   people; when he now relates that the ten men were smitten by the
   plague, he intimates that God would begin with them, so as to manifest
   by this conspicuous and notable example how grossly He was offended by
   their very disgraceful contempt of His grace. Their sudden and
   unnatural death was, therefore, a kind of presage to all the others of
   the punishment which awaited them. For in the first place, the
   expression, "the plague," is emphatic, as much as to say that they
   should not die in the ordinary course of nature. Again, by "the sight
   of God," [73] he means something else than as if he had said, "before
   God;" for God was not merely a beholder of their destruction, but in a
   strange and unusual manner He executed His awful judgment, as if He had
   publicly ascended the tribunal. And this appeared more clearly by His
   prolonging the life of Caleb and Joshua, who were the only survivors of
   that generation until the end of the time prescribed. It is true,
   indeed, that the verbs [74] are in the past tense; but, since there is
   an evident prolepsis, I have not hesitated to change the tense, which
   is a sufficiently common idiom of the language; and thus the connection
   of the address is better preserved.

   however, that it should be used in the sense of dwelling, or
   habitation, so as to correspond with the "shepherd's tent."

   Deuteronomy 1

   Deuteronomy 1:34-36, 39, 40

   34. And the Lord heard the voice of your words, and was wroth, and
   aware, saying,

   34. Audivit autem Jehova vocem verborum vestrorum, iratusque est, ac
   juravit, dicendo:

   35. Surely there shall not one of these men of this evil generation see
   that good land, which I aware to give unto your fathers,

   35. Non videbit quisquam ex hominibus illis de generatione mala hac
   terram bonam quam juravi me daturum patribus vestris;

   36. Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh, he shall see it; and to him will I
   give the land that he hath trodden upon, and to his children, because
   he hath wholly followed the Lord.

   36. Praeter Caleb filium Jephuneh: ipse enim videbit eam, eique dabo
   terram quam calcavit, et filiis ejus, eo quod adimplevit ire post
   Jehovam.

   39. Moreover, your little ones, which ye said should be a prey, and
   your children, which in that day had no knowledge between good and
   evil, they shall go in thither, and unto them will I give it, and they
   shall possess it.

   39. Etiam parvuli vestri, de quibus dixistis, In praedam erunt, ac
   filii vestri, qui non norunt hodie bonum nec malum, ipsi intrabunt
   illuc, illisque dabo eam, et ipsi possidebunt eam.

   40. But as for you, turn you, and take your journey into the
   wilderness, by the way of the Red sea.

   40. Vos autem conversi proficiscimini in desertum per viam maris Suph.

   34. And the Lord heard the voice of your words. I have shown elsewhere
   what is meant by God's hearing, i.e., that nothing can be concealed
   from Him, but that tie will take account of and judge all our words and
   deeds And this is worthy of our observation; for men would never dare
   to murmur against Him, unless they promised themselves impunity [75]
   from His not being present. Secondly, we learn from hence, that God,
   who is a just Judge, does not proceed hastily and without cause to
   inflict punishment on men, and that He does not manifest severity
   without a full examination of the case. He, therefore, means that they
   deprived themselves of their assured inheritance, when they were close
   upon receiving it, through their own rebellion and depravity.

   39. Moreover, your little ones. I have already shown that God so
   tempered His judgment that, whilst none of the guilty should escape
   with impunity, still His faithfulness should remain sure and
   inviolable, and that the wickedness of men should not make void the
   covenant which He had made with Abraham. He, therefore, pronounces
   sentence upon them, that they should never enjoy the inheritance which
   they had despised: yet declares that He will nevertheless be true in
   the fulfillment of what He had promised, and will display His mercy
   towards their children, whom in their despair they had condemned to be
   a prey to their enemies.

   When He limits this grace to their little ones, whose age did not yet
   allow them to discern between good and evil, He signifies that all who
   had already arrived at the years of reason, were, from the least to the
   greatest, accomplices in the crime, since the contagion had spread
   through the whole body. Surely it was an incredible prodigy, that so
   great a multitude should be so carried away by diabolical fury, as that
   nothing should remain unaffected by it, unless perhaps a timely death
   removed some of the old men rather on account of the vice of others
   than their own. But, if even a hundredth part of them had been
   guiltless of the crime, God would have left some survivors.

   "To have no knowledge of good and evil," is equivalent to being unable
   "to discern between their right hand and their left hand;" by which
   expression in Jonah, (Jonah 4:11,) God exempts from condemnation those
   little ones, who have as yet no power of forming a judgment. From
   hence, however, some have foolishly attempted to prove that
   infant-children are not defiled by original sin; and that men are
   involved in no guilt, except such as they have severally contracted by
   their own voluntary act (arbitrio.) For the question here is not as to
   the nature of the human race; a distinction is simply made between
   children and those who have consciously and willfully provoked God's
   wrath; whereas the corruption, which is the root (of all evils, [76] )
   although it may not immediately produce its fruit in actual sins, is
   not [77] therefore non-existent.

   Numbers 14

   Numbers 14:39-45

   39. And Moses told these sayings unto all the children of Israel: and
   the people mourned greatly.

   39. Loquutus est igitur Moses verba ista omnibus filiis Israel, et
   luxerunt populus valde.

   40. And they rose up early in the morning, and gat them up into the top
   of the mountain, saying, Lo, we be here, and will go up unto the place
   which the Lord hath promised: for we have sinned.

   40. Surrexeruntque mane, et ascenderunt in verticem montis, dicendo:
   Ecce nos, ut ascendamus ad locum de quo loquutus est Jehova: quia
   peccavimus.

   41. And Moses said, Wherefore now do ye transgress the commandment of
   the Lord? but it shall not prosper.

   41. Et dixit Moses, Ut quid transgredimini sermonem Jehovae? Et (vel,
   quando) hoc non prospere cedet.

   42. Go not up, for the Lord is not among you; that ye be not smitten
   before your enemies.

   42. Ne ascendatis: quia non est Jehova in medio vestri: ne percutiamini
   coram inimicis vestris.

   43. For the Amalekites and the Canaanites are there before you, and ye
   shall fall by the sword: because ye are turned away from the Lord,
   therefore the Lord will not be with you.

   43. Amalec enim et Chananaeus ibi est ante vos, et cadetis gladio. Nam
   propterea quod aversi estis a sequendo Jehova, neque erit Jehova
   vobiscum.

   44. But they presumed to go up unto the hill-top: nevertheless, the ark
   of the covenant of the Lord, and Moses, departed not out of the camp.

   44. Sumpserunt tamen animos ut ascenderent in verticem montis. Area
   autem foederis Jehovae et Moses non recesserunt e medio castrorum.

   45. Then the Amalekites came down, and the Canaanites which dwelt in
   that hill, and smote them, and discomfited them, even unto Hormah.

   45. Descendit itaque Amalec et Chananaeus, qui habitabant in monte
   illo, percusseruntque eos, et contuderunt usque Horma.

   39. And Moses told all these sayings. It was, indeed, a just cause for
   mourning, when they heard that God, whose longsuffering they had so
   wantonly abused, would hereafter be inexorable. Yet here we have set
   before our eyes that "sorrow of the world which worketh death," as Paul
   says, (2 Corinthians 7:10,) when the wicked, as they weep and complain,
   cease not to murmur against God; nay, when they gnaw the bit with
   greater obstinacy, and thus, like savage and untamable beasts, rush
   forward to their destruction in blind desperation. The temporal
   punishment could not, indeed, be redeemed by any tears; but, if there
   had been the disposition to repent, their only remedy would have been
   voluntarily to submit themselves, and calmly to undergo whatever
   chastisement God might be pleased to inflict. First of all, however,
   they proudly struggle to shake off the punishment awarded to them, and
   whilst they pretended penitence, increasingly kick against God. There
   is no doubt but that it was under the pretence of submission that they
   prepared themselves on the morrow to advance; but wherefore was this,
   except that they may overturn God's inviolable decree! Nevertheless,
   they sought, as if against His. will, to make a way for themselves,
   though He forbade. "Behold us, (they said,) we are ready;" but it was
   too late; for the opportunity had fled. For, as the Prophet exhorts us
   to "seek the Lord while he may be found," (Isaiah 4:6,) so also we
   ought to follow Him when He calls us. But of what avail was this
   unseasonable alacrity of the people? When God wishes them to retire
   into the desert, they affect a desire to obey Him by advancing further;
   and still would have their confession of sin accepted as a sufficient
   satisfaction.

   41. And Moses said, Wherefore do ye now transgress? He rejects this
   feigned penitence, whereby the sinner tries all sorts of shifts, [78]
   so as not to submit himself to God. "If thou wilt return, O Israel,
   return unto me," saith the Lord by Jeremiah, (Jeremiah 4:1.) The first
   thing, therefore, which we must consider is, what God requires of us;
   so that it may plainly appear that we truly submit ourselves to His
   power.

   In order to restrain their temerity, Moses reminds them that they will
   seek in vain for success, when they depart from God's command. And this
   is a very useful piece of instruction, that His grace will never be
   wanting to us, if we simply obey His word; but when, in contempt and
   neglect of His precepts, we are carried away by our own feelings, the
   event will never be prosperous. If any should object that the wretched
   people had no other remedy, I have already stated, that they ought to
   have been contented with this consolation, viz., that banishment from
   the land of Canaan was not disinheritance from the hope of eternal
   life. Nay, if they had humbled themselves before God, they might expect
   that their punishment would have been a profitable help to them. By
   their misdirected activity they double the evil. After having pointed
   out their danger, Moses again impresses upon them that God is not with
   them, because they had deserted Him: and that His blessing was
   withheld, because they had refused to follow Him at the proper time.

   44. But they presumed to go up unto the hill-top. It was not, indeed,
   their intention deliberately to array themselves against God, but
   rather did they endeavor to appease Him by this means of propitiation.
   Nor was their self-deceit devoid of a colorable pretext, inasmuch as
   they were ready cheerfully to welcome death, so as to offer their lives
   in sacrifice, and thus to compensate for their previous hesitation and
   inertness. It is thus that the zeal of the wicked is fervent, when it
   ought to be still; whereas, when God commands, coldness and apathy
   possess their minds, so that they are no more aroused by His voice,
   than as if they were stones. In a word, when it ought to be quiet,
   unbelief is always active, prompt, and bold; but when God would have it
   advance, it is timid, slow, and dead.

   In conclusion, Moses adds, that their foolish enterprise was punished;
   for they were not merely routed and put to flight by their enemies, but
   utterly destroyed. [79] Hence we gather, that their audacity failed
   them in the trial, and was deficient in true courage. At the same time
   he recounts another sign of their senselessness, in that they left
   behind the ark of God, as well as Moses, and rushed forward, like
   doomed persons, to be slaughtered. Hence it appears that unbelievers,
   when carried away by the blind impulse of their zeal, are as much
   destitute of reason and discretion as if they deliberately conspired
   for their own destruction.

   Deuteronomy 1

   Deuteronomy 1:41-46

   41. Then ye answered and said unto me, We have sinned against the Lord,
   we will go up and fight, according to all that the Lord our God
   commanded us. And when ye had girded on every man his weapons of war,
   ye were ready to go up into the hill.

   41. Et respondistis et dixistis ad me, Peccavimus Jehovae: nos
   ascendemus et pugnabimus omnino sicut prancepit nobis Jehova Deus
   noster. Et accinxistis vos singuli armis suis bellicis, et parastis
   ascendere in montem.

   42. And the Lord said unto me, Say unto them, Go not up, neither right;
   for I am not among you; lest ye be smitten before your enemies.

   42. Dixit autem mihi Jehova, Dic eis, Ne ascendatis, neque pugnetis:
   quia non sum in medio vestri, et ne percutiamini coram inimicis
   vestris.

   43. So I spoke unto you; and ye would not hear, but rebelled against
   the commandment of the Lord, and went presumptuously up into the hill.

   43. Loquutus sum haec apud vos sed non audistis, ac rebelles fuistis
   ori Jehovae, et temere egistis ut ascenderetis in montem.

   44. And the Amorites, which dwelt in that mountain, came out against
   you, and chased you, as bees do, and destroyed you in Seir, even unto
   Hormah.

   44. Itaque egressus est Amorrhaeus qui habitabat in monte in occursum
   vestri, et vos persequuti sunt, quemadmodum facere solent apes, et
   contriverunt vos in Seir usque Horma.

   45. And ye returned, and wept before the Lord; but the Lord would not
   hearken to your voice, nor give ear unto you.

   45. Et reversi flevistis coram Jehova: sed non exaudivit Jehova vocem
   vestram, nec auscultavit vobis.

   46. So ye abode in Kadesh many days, according unto the days that ye
   abode there,

   46. Et mansistis in Cades diebus multis, secundum numerum dierum quibus
   mansistis.

   41. Then ye answered and said unto me. The repentance was too late,
   which impelled the Israelites to their unseasonable effort of activity;
   although, as I have above explained, they did not truly and seriously
   repent, since, when they ought patiently to have borne the chastening
   of God, they endeavored to shake it off, and to drive it far away from
   them by a new act of disobedience. In a word, they did nothing else but
   kick against the pricks. But such is the energy of men, when their own
   fancy leads them, that they will dare anything which God forbids. But
   herein did their far worse folly betray itself, in that, when they were
   again withheld, they still refuse to obey. Besides, He does not merely
   forbid them to fight, but denies them His assistance. What then could
   be more monstrous than that, in opposition to God's will, and when the
   hope of His assistance was withdrawn, they should engage in what they
   had just before obstinately refused to attempt under His auspices, and
   by His command, and with the sure promise of success? And yet, so does
   hypocrisy blind men's minds, that they imagined they were correcting
   and compensating for the evil which they doubled. Moses then relates
   how they received the reward which they deserved; as much as to say,
   that, although they might be slow to learn, still they were made
   acquainted, by the reverse which they experienced, how fatal a thing it
   is not to obey God: for fools never learn wisdom except beneath the
   rod.

   45. And ye returned and wept before the Lord. He here appeals to the
   testimony of their own conscience; for they never would have been
   brought to weeping and prayers, except by the force of their own
   feelings. Since, then, they were abundantly convinced, that a just
   punishment was inflicted upon their obstinacy, necessity drove them to
   seek after God: consequently they had no cause to complain, though God
   manifested Himself to be implacable.

   In the last verse there is an ambiguity in the meaning of these words,
   "many days, according to the number of the days." Some, rendering the
   verb in the pluperfect tense, "in which we had remained there," [80]
   suppose that they still abode there another forty days. But it is
   equally probable; that an indefinite time is referred to: as if he had
   said, that the people delayed there a long time, from whence it might
   be inferred, that they lay like persons stupified, from lack of knowing
   what to do.

   It is Kadesh-barnea to which Moses refers, from whence the spies had
   been sent forth; and not the Kadesh where Miriam died, and where the
   people murmured for want of water.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [80] "Quibus antea manseratis." -- Pagninus in Poole. The V. has only
   "Sedistis ergo in Cades-barne multo tempore." On this Corn. a Lapide
   has the following note: "In Hebrew it is added, according to the days
   that ye abode, which Vatablus thus explains, Ye remained in
   Kadesh-barnea as many days after the return of the spies, as ye had
   remained there before their return. Again, the Hebrews themselves, in
   Sealer Olam, thus explain it, Ye remained in Kadesh-barnea as many days
   as ye afterwards remained in all your other stations together, viz., 19
   years: for twice 19 make 38, to which if you add the two years that had
   elapsed before they came to Kadesh-barnea, you will have the forty
   years of their journeyings in the desert. Nothing like this, however,
   can be gathered from our version, nor from the Hebrew either; for the
   expression, according to the days that ye abode,' is merely a Hebrew
   form of repetition, explanatory of what had preceded, and meaning for a
   long time.' -- Hence our interpreter has omitted this Hebrew repetition
   as redundant, and strange to Latin ears."

   Deuteronomy 9

   Deuteronomy 9:22-24

   22. And at Taberah, and at Massah, and at Kibroth-hattaavah, ye
   provoked the Lord to wrath.

   22. Et in Taberah et in Massah, et in Cibroth Hatthaavah ad iram
   provocastis Jehovam.

   23. Likewise, when the Lord sent you from Kadesh-barnea, saying, Go up
   and possess the land which I have given you; then ye rebelled against
   the commandment of the Lord your God, and ye believed him not, nor
   hearkened to his voice.

   23. Et quum misisset vos Jehova de Cades Barnea, dicendo: Ascendite, et
   possidete terram quam dedi vobis, rebellastis verbo Jehovae Dei vestri,
   neque credidistis ei, neque obedivistis voci ejus.

   24. Ye have been rebellious against the Lord from the day that I knew
   you.

   24. Rebelles fuistis Jehovae a die qua cognovi vos.

   22. And at Taberah. He briefly adverts to several cases whereby he may
   convince the people of ingratitude and persevering obstinacy, and thus
   of a corrupt nature: for it is just as if he had said, that they had
   been rebellious against God not once only, nor in one particular way,
   but that they had heaped together many offences, so that it was
   wonderful that God had so often pardoned them. He also recounts the
   names given to the places as memorials of their sins, in order that
   they may at length cease to transgress, since, although so often
   provoked, God had borne with them already too long.

   1. Titan we turned, and took our journey into the wilderness, by the
   way of the Red sea, as the Lord spoke unto me; and we compassed mount
   Stir many days.

   1. Postea reversi profecti sumus in desertum per viam maris Suph,
   quemadmodum loquutus fuerat Jehova ad me, et circumivimus montem Seir
   diebus multis.

   1. Then we turned and took our journey. The time in which they struck
   their camp is not stated in the book of Numbers. This verse, therefore,
   will aptly connect the history, since otherwise there would be an
   abruptness in what immediately follows, he then briefly indicates what
   was the nature of their journeying until the time appointed; viz.,
   that, by wearying themselves in vain in circuitous wanderings, they
   might, at length, learn to follow God directly, and not to decline from
   the way which He points out.

   Leviticus 24

   Leviticus 24:10-14

   10. And the son of an Israelitish woman, whose father was an Egyptian,
   went out among the children of Israel; and this son of the Israelitish
   woman and a man of Israel strove together in the camp:

   10. Egressus est autem filius mulieris Israelitidis, qui erat filius
   viri AEgyptii, in medio filiorum Israel, et jurgati sunt in castris
   ipsis filius Israelitidis et vir Israelita.

   11. And the Israelitish woman's son blasphemed the name of the Lord,
   and cursed. And they brought him unto Moses: (and his mother's name was
   Shelomith, the daughter of Dibri, of the tribe of Dan:)

   11. Et transfixit filius mulieris Israelitidis nomen, et maledixit: ad
   duxeruntque eum ad Mosen: nomen autem matris ejus erat Selomith filia
   Dibri, de tribu Dan.

   12. And they put him in ward, that the mind of the Lord might be showed
   them.

   12. Et posuerunt eum in custodiam, ut exponeret eis juxta sermonem
   Jehovse.

   13. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

   13. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   14. Bring forth him that hath cursed without the camp, and let all that
   heard him lay their hands upon his head, and let all the congregation
   stone him.

   14. Educ blasphemum extra castra, et ponant omnes qui audierunt manus
   suas super caput ejus, et lapidet eum universus coetus.

   10. And the son of an Israelitish woman. In what year, and in what
   station in the desert this occurred, is uncertain. I have, therefore,
   thought it advisable to couple together two cases, which are not
   dissimilar. It is probable that between this instance of punishment,
   and that which will immediately follow, there was an interval of some
   time: but the connection of two similar occurrences seemed best to
   preserve the order of the history; one of the persons referred to
   having been stoned for profaning God's sacred name by wicked blasphemy,
   and the other for despising and violating the Sabbath. It is to be
   observed that the crime of the former of these gave occasion to the
   promulgation of a law, which we have expounded elsewhere: [81] in
   accordance with the common proverb, Good laws spring from bad habits:
   for, after punishment had been inflicted on this blasphemer, Moses
   ordained that none should insult the name of God with impunity.

   It was providentially ordered by God that the earliest manifestation of
   this severity should affect the son of an Egyptian: for, inasmuch as
   God thus harshly avenged the insult of His name upon the offspring of a
   foreigner and a heathen, far less excusable was impiety in Israelites,
   whom God had, as it were, taken up from their mothers' womb, and had
   brought them up in His own bosom. It is true, indeed, that on his
   mother's side he had sprung from the chosen people, but, being begotten
   by an Egyptian father, he could not be properly accounted an Israelite.
   If, then, there had been any room for the exercise of pardon, a
   specious reason might have been alleged why forgiveness should be more
   readily extended to a man of an alien and impure origin. The majesty of
   God's name, however, was ratified by his death. Hence it follows that
   it is by no means to be permitted that God's name should be exposed
   with impunity to blasphemies among the sons of the Church.

   We may learn from this passage that during their tyrannical oppression
   many young women married into the Egyptian nation, in order that their
   affinity might protect their relatives from injuries. It might,
   however, have been the case that love for his wife attracted the father
   of this blasphemer into voluntary exile, unless, perhaps, his mother
   might have been a widow before the departure of the people, so as to be
   at liberty to take her son with her.

   To proceed, he is said to have "gone out," not outside the camp, but in
   public, so that he might be convicted by witnesses; for he would not
   have been brought to trial if his crime had been secretly committed
   within the walls of his own house. This circumstance is also worthy of
   remark, that, although the blasphemy had escaped him in a quarrel,
   punishment was still inflicted upon him; and assuredly it is a
   frivolous subterfuge to require that blasphemies should be pardoned on
   the ground that they have been uttered in anger; for nothing is more
   intolerable than that our wrath should vent itself upon God, when we
   are angry with one of our fellow-creatures. Still it is usual, when a
   person is accused of blasphemy, to lay the blame on the ebullition of
   passion, as if God were to endure the penalty whenever we are provoked.

   The verb nqv, nakab, which some render to express, is here rather used
   for to curse, or to transfix; and the metaphor is an appropriate one,
   that God's name should be said to be transfixed, when it is insultingly
   abused. [82]

   13. And the Lord spoke unto Moses. It must be remembered, then, that
   this punishment was not inflicted upon the blasphemer by man's caprice,
   or the headstrong zeal of the people, but that Moses was instructed by
   Divine revelation what sentence was to be pronounced. It has been
   elsewhere stated [83] why God would have malefactors slain by the hands
   of the witnesses. Another ceremony is here added, viz., that they
   should lay their hands upon his head, as if to throw the whole blame
   upon him.

   Numbers 15

   Numbers 15:32-36

   32. And while the children of Israel were in the wilderness, they found
   a man that gathered sticks upon the Sabbath-day.

   32. Quum autem essent filii Israel in deserto, invenerunt virum
   colligentem ligna die Sabbathi:

   33. And they that found him gathering sticks brought him unto Moses and
   Aaron, and unto all the congregation.

   33. Et adduxerunt illum qui invenerunt colligentem ligna, ad Mosen et
   Aharon, et universam congregationem.

   34. And they put him in ward, because it was not declared what should
   be done to him.

   34. Qui posuerunt eum in custodiam: quia nondum patefactum erat quid
   faciendum esset ei.

   35. And the Lord said unto Moses, The man shall be surely put to death:
   all the congregation shall stone him with stones without the camp.

   35. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Moriendo moriatur vir ille: lapidet eum
   lapidibus universa congregatio extra castra.

   36. And all the congregation brought him without the camp, and stoned
   him with stones, and he died; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   36. Eduxerunt ergo eum congregatio extra castra, et lapidaverunt eum
   lapidibus, et mortuus est, quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova Mosi.


   32. And while the children of Israel. Since we know not in what year,
   or in what month this happened, it appeared that nothing would be
   better than to follow the context of Moses. This history shows that the
   Israelites were not always affected by the same degree of madness, so
   as to be rebellious against God; since in this instance their
   moderation is no less manifested than the fervency of their pious zeal.
   But as one swallow does not make spring, so we shall form an incorrect
   judgment of men's whole lives from one noble action. The transgressor
   of the law is brought to Moses and Aaron, whose authority retains the
   whole people in the path of duty. Their humility is also worthy of
   praise, in that they quietly wait for the decision of God; and finally,
   must be added, their energy in executing the punishment as soon as God
   has declared the sentence. You would say that in every point they were
   rightly conformed to the rules of piety; but, since the most trifling
   occasion immediately led them astray, their hypocrisy was discovered by
   this great levity of conduct.

   This, however, is the sum of the history, that by the death of one man
   the obligation of the Sabbath was sanctioned, so that it might
   henceforth be held in greater reverence. It might indeed be the case
   that these men, who brought the transgressor of the Sabbath, were
   careless in other matters, and, as is usual with hypocrites, were
   excessively rigid in their assertion of the claims of an outward
   ceremony. From the punishment, however, we may infer that the criminal
   himself had not erred through inadvertence, but in gross contempt of
   the Law, so as to think nothing of subverting and corrupting all things
   sacred. Sometimes, indeed, God has severely avenged inconsideration in
   the pollution of holy things; but it is probable that He would not have
   commanded this man to be stoned, unless he had been convicted of
   willful crime. Moreover, by this severity God testified how much stress
   He laid upon the observance of the Sabbath. The reason of this has been
   elsewhere set forth, [84] viz., that by this mark and symbol He had
   separated His chosen people from heathen nations. Whence also arose the
   main reproach against the Jews, when they were called Sabbatarians.
   [85]

   But it must be borne in mind that the worship of God was not to consist
   in mere idleness and festivity; and therefore that what God enjoined
   respecting the seventh day had another object: not only that they
   should then employ themselves in meditating upon His works, but that,
   renouncing themselves and their own works, they should live unto God.

   Furthermore, this case shows us in general that the magistracy is
   appointed no less for the maintenance of the First Table, than the
   Second; so that, if they inflict punishment upon murder, adultery, and
   theft, they should also vindicate the worship of God: for it is to be
   observed that the man was not stoned by a mere unreflecting impulse,
   but by the direct command of God. They knew, indeed, what he had
   deserved before God's tribunal; but, since no political law had been
   given on this head, Moses was unwilling to come to any decision except
   by the authority of God.

   Numbers 16

   Numbers 16:1-50

   1. Now Korah, the son of Izhar, the son of Kohath, the son of Levi: and
   Dathan and Abiram the sons of Eliab; and On the son of Peleth, sons of
   Reuben, tool: men:

   1. Tulit autem Corah filius Ishar, filii Cehath, filii Levi, et Dathan
   et Abiram filii Eliab, et On filius Peleth filii Reuben.

   2. And they rose up before Moses, with certain of the children of
   Israel, two hundred and fifty princes of the assembly, famous in the
   congregation, men of renown:

   2. Et surrexerunt coram Mose, et viri e filiis Israel ducenti
   quinquaginta, principes congregationis, vocati ad tempus statutum, viri
   nominis.

   3. And they gathered themselves together against Moses and against
   Aaron, and said unto them, Ye take too much upon you, seeing all the
   congregation are holy, every one of them, and the Lord is among them:
   wherefore then lift ye up yourselves above the congregation of the
   Lord?

   3. Congregatique sunt adversum Mosen et Aharon, ac dixerunt eis, Sat
   sit vobis: nam tota congregatio, universi ipsi sancti sunt, et in
   medio, eorum est Jehova: quare ergo effertis vos supra congregationem
   Jehovae?

   4. And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his bee:

   4. Quod quum audisset Moses, projecit se in faciem suam.

   5. And he spoke unto Korah, and unto all his company, saying, Even
   tomorrow the Lord will show who are his, and who is holy; and will
   cause him to come near unto him: even him whom he hath chosen will he
   cause to come near unto him.

   5. Et loquutus est ad Corah et ad omnem congregationem ejus, dicendo:
   Mane ostendet Jehova qui sint ejus, et quis sanctus, et ut accedat ad
   se: et quem elegerit, accedere faciet ad se.

   6. This do; Take you censers, Korah, and all his company;

   6. Hoc facite, capite vobis acerras, Corah et tota congregatio ejus,

   7. And put fire therein, and put incense in them before the Lord
   tomorrow: and it shall be, that the man whom the Lord doth choose, he
   shall be holy: ye take too much upon you, ye sons of Levi.

   7. Et ponite in illis ignem, imponite quoque in eis incensum coram
   Jehova cras, et erit, vir quem elegerit Jehova, erit ille sanctus:
   satis sit vobis filii Levi.

   8. And Moses said unto Korah, Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi;

   8. Et dixit Moses ad Corah: Audite, quaeso, filii Levi.

   9. Seemeth it but a small thing unto you, that the God of Israel hath
   separated you from the congregation of Israel, to bring you near to
   himself, to do the service of the tabernacle of the Lord, and to stand
   before the congregation to minister unto them?

   9. An parurn hoe vobis est quod separaverit Deus Israelis vos de
   congregatione Israel, ut accedere faceret vos sibi ut ministretis in
   ministerio tabernaculi Jehovae, et ut staretis coram congregatione, ut
   ministraretis ei.

   10. And he hath brought thee near to him, and all thy brethren the sons
   of Levi with thee: and seek ye the priesthood also

   10. Et accedere fecit te, et omnes fratres tuos, filios Levi tecum:
   nisi quaeratis etiam sacerdotium?

   11. For which cause, both thou and all thy company are gathered
   together against the Lord: and what is Aaron, that ye murmur against
   him?

   11. Idcirco tu et universa congregatio tua estis qui conveniunt contra
   Jehovam: at vero Aharon quid est, quod murmurastis adversus eum?

   12. And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram, the sons of Eliab; which
   said, We will not come up:

   12. Misit etiam Moses ad vocandum Dathan et Abiram filios Eliab: qui
   responderunt, Non ascendemus.

   13. Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us up out of a land that
   floweth with milk and honey, to kill us in the wilderness, except thou
   make thyself altogether a prince over us?

   13. An parum es quod ascendere feceris nos e terra quae fluit lacte et
   melle, ut mori nos faceres in deserto, nisi etiam dominando domineris
   nobis?

   14. Moreover, thou hast not brought us into a land that floweth with
   milk and honey, or given us inheritance of fields and vineyards: wilt
   thou put out the eyes of these men? we will not come up.

   14. Atqui certe ad terram quae fluit lacte et melle non introduxistis
   nos, neque dedisti nobis haereditatem agrorum et vinearum: an oculos
   virorum istorum effodies? Non ascendemus.

   15. And Moses was very wroth, and said unto the Lord, Respect not thou
   their offering: I have not taken one ass from them, neither have I hurt
   one of them.

   15. Iratus est ergo Moses valde, et dixit ad Jehovam, Ne respicias ad
   oblationem eorum: ne asellum quidem unum ab eis accepi, neque afflixi
   quenquam ex ipsis.

   16. And Moses said unto Korah, Be thou and all thy company before the
   Lord, thou, and they, and Aaron, tomorrow:

   16. Postea dixit Moses ad Corah, Tu et universa congregatio tua estote
   coram Jehova, tu et illi et Aharon cras.

   17. And take every man his censer, and put incense in them, and bring
   ye before the Lord every man his censer, two hundred and fifty censers;
   thou also, and Aaron, each of you his censer.

   17. Et capite quisque acerram suam, et ponite in illis suffitum, et
   admovete coram Jehova quisque acerram suam, ducentas quinquaginta
   acerras, tu quoque et Aharon, quisque acerram suam.

   18. And they took every man his censer, and put fire in them, and laid
   incense thereon, and stood in the door of the tabernacle of the
   congregation with Moses and Aaron.

   18. Tulerunt igitur quisque acerram suam, et posuerunt in ipsis ignem,
   posueruntque suffitum, et steterunt ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis,
   et Moses et Aharon.

   19. And Korah gathered all the congregation against them unto the door
   of the tabernacle of the congregation: and the glory of the Lord
   appeared unto all the congregation.

   19. Congregaverat autem contra ipsos Corah, universam congregationem ad
   ostium tabernaculi conventionis: et visa est gloria Jehovae a tota
   multitudine.

   20. And the Lord spoke unto Moses and unto Aaron, saying,

   20. Tunc loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon, dicendo:

   21. Separate yourselves from among this congregation, that I may
   consume them in a moment.

   21. Separate vos e medio turbae, ejus, et consumam eos momento.

   22. And they fell upon their faces, and said, O God, the God of the
   spirits of all flesh, shall one man sin, and wilt thou be wroth with
   all the congregation?

   22. Tunc ceciderunt super facies suas, ac dixerunt, Deus (vel, fortis)
   Deus spirituum in universa carne, num quum vir unus peccaverit, contra
   totum coetum excandesces?

   23. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

   23. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen dicendo:

   24. Speak unto the congregation, saying, Get you up from about the
   tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram.

   24. Alloquere congregationem, dicendo, Discedite e circuitu tabernaculi
   Corae, Dathan, et Abiram.

   25. And Moses rose up, and went unto Dathan and Abiram: and the elders
   of Israel followed him.

   25. Surrexit ergo Moses, et venit ad Dathan et Abiram: et sequuti sunt
   eum seniores Israel.

   26. And he spoke unto the congregation, saying, Depart, I pray you,
   from the tents of these wicked men, and touch nothing of theirs, lest
   ye be consumed in all their sins.

   26. Tune loquutus est ad congregationera, dicens, Recedite nunc a
   tabernaculis virorum istorum impiorum, neque attingatis quicquam eorum
   quae ad illos pertinent, ne forte pereatis in omnibus peccatis illorum.

   27. So they gat up from the tabernacle of Korah, Dathan, and Abiram, on
   every side: and Dathan and Abiram came out, and stood in the door of
   their tents, and their wives, and their sons, and their little
   children.

   27. Et recesserunt a tabernaculo Corae, Dathan et Abiram, e circuitu.
   Dathan vero et Abiram egressi sunt, ac steterunt ad ostium
   tabernaculorum suorum, et uxores eorum, et filii eorum, et parvuli
   eorum.

   28. And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know that the Lord hath sent me to
   do all these works; (for I have not done them of mine own mind:)

   28. Tunc dixit Moses, In hoc scietis quod Jehova miserit me, ut facerem
   omnia opera haec, et quod non de corde meo:

   29. If these men die the common death of all men, or if they be visited
   after the visitation of all men, then the Lord hath not sent me:

   29. Si ut moriuntur omnes homines, morientur isti, et visitatione
   omnium hominum visitabitur super eos, non misit me Jehova:

   30. But if the Lord make a new thing, and the earth open her mouth, and
   swallow them up, with all that appertain unto them, and they go down
   quick into the pit; then ye shall understand that these men have
   provoked the Lord.

   30. Sin autem creationem creaverit Jehova, et aperuit terra os suum, et
   deglutiverit eos, atque omnia quae ad illos pertinent, et descenderint
   viventes in infernum: tum cognoscetis quod irritaverunt viri isti
   Jehovam.

   31. And it came to pass, as he had made an end of speaking all these
   words, that the ground clave asunder that was under them:

   31. Fuit igitur quum consummasset loqui omnia verba ista, rupit sese
   terra quae erat sub illis:

   32. And the earth opened her mouth, and swallowed them up, and their
   houses, and all the men that appertained unto Korah, and all their
   goods.

   32. Aperuitque terra os suum, et deglutivit eos, et domos eorum, atque
   omnes homines qui erant ipsi Corah, et omnem substantiam:

   33. They, and all that appertained to them, went down alive into the
   pit, and the earth closed upon them: and they perished from among the
   congregation.

   33. Descenderuntque ipsi et quotquot ad eos pertinebant viventes, in
   infernum: ac operuit eos terra, et perierunt e medio congregationis.

   34. And all Israel that were round about them fled at the cry of them:
   for they said, Lest the earth swallow us up also.

   34. Omnis autem Israel qui erant in circuitu eorum, fugerunt ad
   clamorem eorum: dicebant enim, Ne forte deglutiat nos terra.

   35. And there came out a fire from the Lord, and consumed the two
   hundred and fifty men that offered incense.

   35. Porro ignis egressus est a Jehova, et consumpsit ducentos illos, et
   quinquaginta viros offerentes suffitum.

   36. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

   36. Tunc loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   37. Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron the priest, that he take up the
   censers out of the burning, and scatter thou the fire yonder; for they
   are hallowed.

   37. Dic ad Eleazar filium Aharon sacerdotis, ut tollat acerras e medio
   incendii, et ignem dispergat longius, quid sanctificatae sunt.

   38. The censers of these sinners against their own souls, let them make
   them broad plates for a covering of the altar; for they offered them
   before the Lord, therefore they are hallowed: and they shall be a sign
   unto the children of Israel.

   38. Quod ad acerras istorum qui scelerati fuerunt in animas suas, ut
   faciant ex illis extensiones laminarum, opertorium altaris: quia
   obtulerunt in ipsis coram Jehova, et sanctificatae sunt: et erunt in
   signum filiis Israel.

   39. And Eleazar the priest took the brazen censers, wherewith they that
   were burnt had offered, and they were made broad plates for a covering
   of the altar;

   39. Tulit itaque Eleazar sacerdos acerras aereas quibus obtulerant
   combusti, et extenderunt eas operimentum altaris.

   40. To be a memorial unto the children of Israel that no stranger,
   which is not of the seed of Aaron, come near to offer incense before
   the Lord, that he be not as Korah, and as his company; as the Lord said
   to him by the hand of Moses.

   40. Memoriale filiis Israel, ut non accedat quisquam alienus qui non
   sit e semine Aharon, ut offerat suffitum coram Jehova, ne sit sicut
   Corah et coetus ejus: quemadmodum ei praeceperat Jehova per manum
   Mosis.

   41. But on the morrow all the congregation of the children of Israel
   murmured against Moses and against Aaron, saying, Ye have killed the
   people of the Lord.

   41. Et murmuraverunt universus coetus filiorum Israel postridie contra
   Mosen et Aharon, dicendo, Vos interfecistis populum Jehovae.

   42. And it came to pass, when the congregation was gathered against
   Moses and against Aaron, that they looked toward the tabernacle of the
   congregation; and. behold, the cloud covered it, and the glory of the
   Lord appeared.

   42. Fuit autem quum se congregaret universus coetus contra Mosen et
   Aharon, verterunt faciem ad tabernaculum conventionis, et ecce operuit
   illud nubes et conspecta est gloria Jehovae.

   43. And Moses and Aaron came before the tabernacle of the congregation.

   43. Venit ergo Moses et Aharon coram tabernaculo conventionis.

   44. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

   44. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   45. Get you up from among this congregation, that I may consume them as
   in a moment. And they fell upon their hoes.

   45. Recedite e medio congregationis hujus, et consumam eos momento.
   Tunc projecerunt se super faciem suam.

   46. And Moses said unto Aaron, Take a censer, and put fire therein from
   off the altar, and put on incense, and go quickly unto the
   congregation, and make an atonement for them: for there is wroth gone
   out from the Lord; the plague is begun.

   46. Dixitque Moses ad Aharon, Cape acerram, et pone in ea ignem ex
   altari, et injice suffitum et perge cito ad congregationem, et expia
   eos: egressus est enim furor a facie Jehovae, coepitque percussio.

   47. And Aaron took as Moses commanded, and ran into the midst of the
   congregation; and, behold, the plague was begun among the people: and
   he put on incense, and made an atonement for the people.

   47. Tulit ergo Aharon quenmadmodum dixerat Moses, et cucurrit in medium
   congregationis: et ecce incoeperat percussio in populo, posuitque
   suffitum et expiavit populum.

   48. And he stood between the dead and the living; and the plague was
   stayed.

   48. Et quum staret inter mortuos et viventes, cessavit percussio.

   49. Now they that died in the plague were fourteen thousand and seven
   hundred, besides them that died about the matter of Korah.

   49. Fuernnt autem qui mortui sunt plaga illa, quatuordecim millia et
   septingenti, praeter mortuos super negotio Corah.

   50. And Aaron returned unto Moses unto the door of the tabernacle of
   the congregation: and the plague was stayed.

   50. Postea reversus est Aharon ad Mosen ad ostium tabernaculi
   conventionis, quum percussio esset cohibita.


   1. Now Korah, the son of Izhar. The impious conspiracy is here related
   of a few men, but these of the highest rank, whose object was to
   subvert and destroy the divinely-appointed priesthood. They make their
   attack, indeed, upon Moses, and accuse him of ruling unjustly; for thus
   it is that turbulent persons are carried away without reason or
   discrimination; but, the only cause why they are set against him is
   because they suppose him to be the originator of the priesthood, as we
   easily collect from his reply. For he does not command them to stand
   forth, in order that they may decide respecting the political
   government or chieftainship, but that it may be made plain whether God
   acknowledges them as priests; nor does he reproach the Levites with
   anything but that, not content with their own lot, they have an
   unreasonable ambition to obtain the honor of the high-priesthood. It
   was jealousy, then, that instigated Korah and his companions to set on
   foot first a quarrel, and then a tumult; respecting the priesthood,
   because they were indignant that the hope of attaining that honor was
   taken away from themselves and their posterity for ever. Thus there
   never was any more deadly or abominable plague in the Church of God,
   than ambition; inasmuch as it cannot be that those who seek for
   pre-eminence should range themselves beneath God's yoke. Hence arises
   the dissolution of legitimate authority, when each one neglects the
   duties of his position, and aims at his own private advancement.

   Now, this conspiracy was the more formidable, because the sedition did
   not arise from the dregs of the people, but amongst the princes
   themselves, who were of high dignity, and held in the greatest
   estimation. For although there were only four leaders of the faction,
   there is but little room to doubt but that the purpose of the two
   hundred and fifty was the same; for they would never have eagerly
   embarked in a grave and invidious contest for the sake of four men; but
   the fact was, that all unholy covetousness misled them all, for there
   was none of them who did not expect some prize as a reward of victory.
   They not only, then, dissemble their mental disease, but conceal it
   under an honorable pretext; for they pretend that they are instigated
   by zeal for the public good, and that their object is the defense of
   liberty. For, inasmuch as ambition is crafty, it is never destitute of
   some specious excuse: thus, whilst schismatics are influenced by
   nothing but pride to disturb the peace of the Church, they always
   invent plausible motives, whereby they may conciliate in some degree
   the favor of the ignorant, or even of the unstable and worthless. We
   must, therefore, cautiously weigh the designs of those who seek to make
   innovations, and to overthrow a state of things which might be endured;
   for thorough investigation will make it plain that; they aim at
   something besides what they pretend. By the, fact of their so speedily
   engaging such a multitude of persons in their party, we perceive how
   disposed man's nature is to the most unpromising and unreasonable
   revolts in the world. Four worthless men wickedly endeavor to overthrow
   Moses and Aaron; and straightway two hundred and fifty persons are
   ready to follow them, not of the populace, but chiefs of the tribes,
   whose reputation might dazzle the eyes of the simple. Hence we must be
   the more cautious, lest any bugbears (larvae) should deceive us into
   making rash innovations.

   With respect to the wording of the passage, some refer the verb "he
   took," [86] to the other conspirators, as if it were said that Korah
   stirred them up. Others explain it that he instigated himself, and
   hurried himself onwards by his evil passions. I do not, however, assent
   to either signification, but take it for "he set to work" (aggressus
   est.) When it is afterwards said that "they rose up before Moses," some
   understand the words according to their simple meaning, others in a bad
   sense; and undoubtedly here the expression "before the face of," is
   equivalent to "against," and thus indicates the wantonness of their
   aggression. There is more difficulty in the words qr'y mvd, [87] kerei
   mogned. All, however, almost with one consent, translate them "great in
   the congregation;" but since the word qryym, keriira, generally
   signifies persons called or invited, and mvd, mogned, not only an
   assembly, but also an appointed time, or convention, it seems probable
   to me that these princes and men of high name are stated to have been
   present, because they were called according to appointment: as if Moses
   had said that they were called at a fixed time, or by agreement. For
   neither do I see any reason why, after the word dh, [88] gnedah, mvd,
   mogned, should be used with the same meaning.

   3. Ye take too much upon you. [89] Some explain, "Let it suffice," as
   if they desired to put an end to the tyranny of Moses; but I am rather
   of opinion that they would thus make a charge of presumptuous and
   sacrilegious supremacy, as if Moses and Aaron had not only usurped more
   than their right, but had also robbed God of His supreme authority.
   They, therefore, reproach the holy men with having impiously subjected
   to themselves the inheritance of God. Thus we see that God's faithful
   servants, whatever may be their moderation, are still not exempted from
   false accusations. Moses was an extraordinary example, not only of
   integrity, but also of humility and gentleness; yet he is called proud
   and violent, as if he unworthily oppressed the people of God. Observe
   further, that God permits His servants to be loaded with such unjust
   calumnies, in order to teach them that they must expect their reward
   elsewhere than from the world; and that the may humble them and make
   trial of their endurance. Let us learn, then, to harden ourselves, so
   as to be prepared, though we do well, to be evil spoken of. These
   ungodly and seditious men betray their senselessness as well as their
   impudence. For by what right do they seek to degrade Moses and Aaron?
   Because, forsooth, God dwells amongst the people, and all in the
   congregation are holy! But holiness is neither destructive of
   subordination, nor does it introduce confusion, nor release believers
   from the obligation to obey the laws. It is madness in them, then, to
   infer that those, whom God has sane-titled, are not subject to the
   yoke; yet they maliciously stigmatize as tyranny that care of the
   people which God has intrusted to His servants, as if they would
   purposely turn light into darkness.

   4. And when Moses heard it, he fell upon his face. There is no doubt
   but that he had recourse to prayer in his perplexity, since he knew
   that the remedy for so great an evil was only in the hand of God. It is
   in this respect that the magnanimity of the ungodly differs from the
   firmness of believers; for it often happens that unbelievers also labor
   in the defense of a good cause, voluntarily expose themselves to the
   hatred of many, undergo severe contests, and encounter of their own
   accord great perils; but with them obstinacy stands in the place of
   virtue. But those who look to God, since they know that the prosperous
   or unhappy events of all things are in His power, thus rely upon His
   providence; and when any adversity occurs, implore His faithfulness and
   assistance. When, therefore, Moses cast himself upon the earth, this
   [90] supplication was of more: value than all those heroic virtues in
   which unbelievers have ever seemed to excel.

   5. And he spoke unto Korah. Moses did not inconsiderately choose this
   mode of divination, but by the dictation of the Spirit maintained the
   priesthood of his brother by this token and testimony; for we know how,
   in matters of doubt and obscurity, he was accustomed to inquire what
   God's pleasure was. He did not, therefore, at this time make this
   proposal hastily and at random, but by the inspiration of the Spirit
   had recourse to the sure judgment of God. The effect of his prayer was
   that God suggested an easy and expeditious mode of conquest.

   He bids them take their censers, that by their incense-offering it
   might be manifested whether their oblation was acceptable to God. By
   deferring it to the morrow he con-suited their own safety, if any of
   them might still be not incurable; for he saw that they were carried
   away headlong by blind fury, and that they could not be recalled to
   their senses in a moment. He, therefore, grants them some space of time
   for repentance, that they might be led to consideration during the
   night; or perhaps his object was that, the tumult being appeased, he
   might render them all attentive to the decision of God.

   8. Hear, I pray you, ye sons of Levi. He addresses the whole body, and
   yet it is said that his discourse was directed to Korah alone, and this
   was because he had corrupted others of the Levites, and therefore is
   first summoned to God's tribunal, so that the whole party might be at
   the same time included. He was able to expostulate with the Levites at
   once, because their residence was close to the sanctuary.

   He accuses them of ingratitude, because they were not satisfied with
   the honor with which God had already dignified them, but also sought
   the high-priesthood. In this they betrayed their despisal of His grace;
   for, if they had rightly valued the gifts of God, each of them would
   have quietly contented himself with his lot; especially since, in
   proportion as a person has been liberally dealt with, his ingratitude
   is more intolerable, if he aspires to anything higher. We are taught,
   therefore, that the higher the degree may be to which we have been
   elevated by God's goodness, the greater is the punishment which our
   crime deserves, if our ambition still incites us to overleap the bounds
   of our calling. Nevertheless, such is the perversity of almost all men,
   that as soon as a person has attained some intermediate position, he
   uplifts, as it were, the standard of pride [91] and prescribes to
   himself no limit, until he shall have reached above the clouds. In a
   word, few are found who do not grow insolent in places of honor.
   Wherefore we ought to be all the more attentive to this admonition of
   Moses, that those are most ungrateful to God who despise their lot,
   which is already honorable, and aim at something higher.

   11. For which cause both thou, and all thy company. He here lays open
   their sin, which they had endeavored to disguise. For they had neither
   scruple nor shame, as we have seen, in pretending pious zeal. But in
   one word Moses scatters these mists, telling them that they were
   instigated by nothing but pride and envy to disturb the condition of
   the people. We must observe the expression which he uses, that they are
   in "arms against God;" for, although they might have never confessed to
   themselves that they had to do with Him, but only that they were
   contending for the pre-eminence with men; still, because it was their
   aim to overthrow the order established by God, Moses casts aside all
   false pretences, and sets before them the simple fact that they are
   waging war with God, when they are fighting with His servants. If,
   therefore, we are afraid of contending with Him, let us learn to remain
   in our right place. For, however they may prevaricate, who disturb the
   Church through their ambition, in fighting against the servants of God,
   they attack Himself: and therefore it is needful that He should resist
   them, to avenge Himself. For war is not waged against God, as the poets
   feign the giants to have done, when they heaped up mountains, and
   endeavored to surmount heaven; but when He is assailed in the person of
   His servants, and when what He has decreed is in any wise undermined.
   The vocation of the priests was sacred, so that they who conspired to
   overthrow it, were the open enemies of God, as much as if they had
   directed their arms, their strength, and their assaults against Him. We
   must, therefore, bear in mind the reason which is subjoined, "And what
   is Aaron?" for, if Aaron had usurped anything for himself, his temerity
   and audacity would not have been supported by the countenance of God.
   Moses, therefore, declares that this is God's cause, because there was
   nothing human in the ordinance of the priesthood. It was, indeed, an
   honorable office, so that Aaron justly deserved to be thought something
   of; but Moses indicates that he had nothing of his own, nor arrogated
   anything to himself; in a word, that he is nothing in himself, and
   moreover, that he is not elevated for his own private advantage, and
   that his dignity is no idle one; but rather a laborious burden placed
   upon his shoulders for the common welfare of the Church. How utterly
   ridiculous, then, is the folly of the Pope in comparing all the enemies
   of his tyranny to Koran, Dathan, and Abiram; for, in order to prove
   that his cause is connected with that of God, let him show us the
   credentials of his calling, and at the same time thoroughly fulfil his
   office. But what frivolous and vapid trifling it is, when some mimic
   Aaron sets himself up -- produces no divine command or vocation --
   domineers in obedience to his own lusts, and is rather an actor on the
   stage than a priest in the temple; that all who reject this spurious
   dominion should be condemned as schismatics! Wherefore let us hold fast
   this principle, that war is waged against God when His servants are
   molested, who are both lawfully called and faithfully exercise their
   office.

   12. And Moses sent to call Dathan and Abiram. He desired, in this way,
   if it might be, by his holy admonitions, to withhold them from that
   destruction, on which they were rushing. Therefore he ceased not to
   provide for their welfare, though he had thus far experienced that they
   were altogether in a desperate state. Herein he presented a likeness of
   the loving-kindness of God, by whose Spirit he was directed; not only
   because he was unwilling to pass sentence without hearing the cause,
   but also because he endeavored to bring them to repentance, that they
   might not willfully destroy themselves. Nevertheless it came to pass at
   this time, as also often afterwards, that not only was the earnestness
   of the Prophet, with respect to these unbelievers, throw away, but that
   it hardened them more and more. For we know what was said by Isaiah;

   "Make the heart of this people fat, and make their ears heavy, and shut
   their eyes: lest they see with their eyes, and hear with their ears,
   and understand with hearts, and convert, and be healed." (Isaiah 6:10.)

   Thus does it please God to discover the wickedness of the reprobate, in
   order that they may be rendered the more inexcusable.

   13. Is it a small thing that thou hast brought us. It is not enough for
   these wicked men, when they are invited to discussion, contumaciously
   to repudiate the superiority of Moses, unless they also assail him with
   counter-accusations. The crime they allege against him must be
   observed. They reproach him for having led them up out of the land of
   Egypt: though they cunningly suppress its name, whilst they
   magniloquently extol its fruitfulness, in order to throw into the shade
   all that God had promised with respect to the land of Canaan. Nay, they
   seem to transfer slyly to Egypt the very phrase which Moses had often
   used, so that thus God's blessing may be, as it were buried. But what
   gross ingratitude it showed, to allege as a crime against Moses, God's
   minister, that deliverance, which was so extraordinary an act of His
   kindness! In the next place, they reproach him with having brought them
   into the desert, to die: and this they enlarge upon in the next verse,
   and maliciously inquire, Where is the truth of the promises? At length
   they conclude that Moses is impudent in his deceptions, inasmuch as it
   plainly appears that the people had been imposed upon by him: as if it
   were his fault that they had deprived themselves of the possession of
   the promised land. Moses had exhorted them, by God's command, to enter
   upon the inheritance promised to them: what dishonesty and petulance,
   therefore, was it, when they had shut the door against themselves, to
   complain of Moses, upon whom it had not depended that they were not in
   the enjoyment of fields and vineyards! In the third place, they taunt
   Moses with seeking to domineer over a free people. He did indeed
   preside over them; but how far short of dominion was that moderate
   control, which was as onerous to Moses, as it was advantageous to the
   whole people! But this is the condition of God's servants, that their
   course is through reproaches, [92] though they are conducting
   themselves aright.

   15. And Moses was very wroth. Although it might be, that there was
   something of human passion here, still zeal for God was supreme in his
   mind, nor did intemperate feelings, if he was at all tempted by them,
   prevail. Assuredly, it appears probable, from the context, that he was
   inflamed with holy ardor; since he executes the vengeance of God, as
   His lawful minister, so that it is plain he neither spoke nor did
   anything but at the dictation of the Spirit. Nay, we shall soon see
   that, although he was anxious with regard to the public safety, he
   required that but a few offenders should be punished, and not that the
   multitude should perish. Nor does his anger burst forth into revilings:
   as those, who are carried away by excess, usually assail the enemies by
   whom they are injured, with their tongue as well as their hands: but he
   betakes himself to God; nor does he ask more than flint they may be
   brought to shame in their pride. This is, indeed, expounded generally,
   by many, as if Moses desired that God should have no mercy upon them;
   but inasmuch as the decision of the quarrel depended on the approbation
   or rejection by God of rite offering they were about to make, he does
   not seem to me to pray for more than that God, by refusing their
   polluted gift, should thus chastise their ambition. At the same time
   also he shows that his prayer springs from the confidence of a good
   conscience, when he dares to testify before God that he had injured no
   man. Now this was the extreme of integrity and disinterestedness, that,
   when the people owed everything to him, he had not taken even the value
   of a single ass as the reward of all his labors.

   16. And Moses said unto Korah. The idea of Moses is not to make an
   experiment as if in a doubtful matter; but, being assured by the Spirit
   of prophecy what the event would be, he summons Korah before the
   tribunal of God, that he may receive the sentence of condemnation which
   he deserves. Nor does he inveigle him so as to destroy him unawares,
   but rather still endeavors to cure his madness, if it were possible to
   do so. For the sacred incense-offering was calculated to inspire him
   with alarm, lest, by rashly attempting more than was lawful, he should
   effect his own destruction, especially after so memorable an example
   had been made in the case of Nadab and Abihu. Moses, however, in
   reliance on God's command, does not hesitate to engage in an open
   contest, in order that the judgment of God might be the more
   conspicuous.

   18. And they took every man his censer. It is manifest how greatly they
   were blinded by pride, since, although admonished both by the
   confidence of Moses and also by the previous examples, they still
   obstinately go forward. Surely if any spark of the fear of God had
   remained in them, their censers would straightway have fallen from
   their hands; but Korah seems to have sought, as it were, deliberately
   how he might cast aside all fear, and totally bereave himself of his
   senses. For in the next verse, Moses narrates how ostentatiously he
   hardened himself in his rebellion, before he should offer the incense;
   for he gathered the people together to his party, in order that the
   magnificence of his array might overwhelm the grace of God, which
   opposed[ him. Herein also his senselessness is clearly seen, when he
   seeks to fortify himself against God by the favor of the, mob, as if he
   had desired to extinguish the light of the sun by interposing a little
   smoke. Now, let us learn so to condemn his folly, as that nothing
   similar may happen in ourselves; for all ambitious persons are affected
   by the same disease. They collect their forces by endeavoring to
   ingratiate themselves with men; and, if the world approves of' them,
   they are inebriated with such fatal confidence, as to spit at the very
   clouds. But we shall soon see how God, by a single breath, dissipates
   all their ungodly conspiracies.

   On the other side, the levity of the people is set before our eyes. For
   some time they had been all accustomed to the duly-appointed
   priesthood, which they knew to be instituted by God; yet only a single
   night is required to make them revolt to Korah. And, in fact, as we are
   by nature slow to act aright, so also we are carried away to evil in a
   moment, as soon as some villain lifts up his finger.

   21. Separate yourselves from among this congregation. Again does God
   declare that He will bear the people's great impiety no longer, but
   will destroy them all to a man. Just, therefore, as he had commanded
   Lot to depart from Sodom, nay, had drawn him out by the hand of the
   angel, when He desired to destroy that city, so He now commands Moses
   and Aaron to give Him room to exercise His wrath. In this He declares
   His extraordinary favor towards them; as if He were not free to execute
   vengeance, until they had gone out of the way, lest the destruction
   should reach themselves. In speaking thus, however, He does not
   absolutely affirm what He had determined in His secret counsel, but
   only pronounces what the authors of this wickedness had deserved. It
   is, therefore, just as if He were ascending His judgment-seat. Thus
   Moses by his intercession by no means changed His eternal decree; but,
   by appeasing Him, delivered the people from the punishment they had
   merited. In the same sense God is said to be influenced by our prayers;
   not that after the manner of men He assumes new feelings, but, in order
   to show the more than paternal love with which he honors us, He, as it
   were, indulges us, when He listens to our desires. Hence we gather that
   even by this express denunciation Moses was not prohibited from
   praying; because his faith in the adoption of the people was not
   destroyed. For we have already said that this principle, that the
   covenant which God had made with Abraham could not be made void, was so
   thoroughly an-graven upon his mind, that it surmounted whatever
   obstacles might present themselves. Resting, therefore, on the
   gratuitous promise, which depended not on men, his prayer was the
   offspring of faith. For the saints do not always reason accurately and
   subtlety as to the form of their prayers; but, after they have once
   embraced that which suffices to awaken in them confidence in prayer,
   viz., God's word, their whole attention is so directed to it, that they
   pass over the things which seem apparently to contradict it. Nor can we
   doubt but that it was God's design, when He delivered his terrible
   sentence as to the destruction of the people, to quicken the
   earnestness of Moses in prayer, since necessity more and more inflames
   the zeal of the pious. In short, Moses was always consistent in his
   care for the well-being of the people.

   22. O God, the God of the, spirits of all flesh. The old interpreter
   renders the first 'l, el, as an adjective, in which some others have
   followed him; [93] but, in my opinion, the name of God is rather
   repeated by way of adding force to the sentence. It does not, however,
   so clearly appear to me why all render the word flesh, in the genitive
   case. But, since I do not think that the l, lamed, is superfluous here,
   but that it is used for v, beth, as often elsewhere, I have accurately
   expressed the sense by my translation, "in all flesh." [94] There is no
   question but that Moses applies this epithet to God in connection with
   the present matter; as if he desired to induce God to preserve His own
   work, just as a potter spares the vessels formed by himself. To the
   same effect is the prayer of Isaiah:

   "But now, O Lord, thou art our father; we are the clay, and thou our
   potter; and we all are the work of thy hand. Be not wroth very sore,"
   (Isaiah 64:8, 9:)

   for hence he alleges a reason why God should relent, and be inclined to
   mercy. There is this difference, that Isaiah refers to that special
   grace wherewith God had embraced His people, whereas Moses carries his
   address further, viz., to the general grace of creation. It is of
   little importance whether we choose to expound this [95] with reference
   to all animals, or only to the human race, since Moses merely prays
   that, since God is the Creator and Maker of the world, He should not
   destroy the men whom He has formed, but rather have pity upon them, as
   being His work. In passing, however, we may infer from this passage,
   [96] that all (men) have their separate souls, for God is not said to
   have inspired all flesh with life, but to have created their spirits.
   Hence the monstrous delusion of the Manicheans is refuted, that our
   souls are so infused by the transmission of the Spirit of God, as that
   there should still be only one spirit. [97] But if it be preferred to
   include the animals, we must mark the grades of distinction between the
   spirit of man and the spirit of a dog or an ass. It is, however, more
   fitting to restrict it to men.

   24. Speak unto the congregation, saying. It is evident, from this
   answer, that Moses was heard as regarded the general preservation of
   the people, on condition, however, that they should give proof of their
   repentance, by deserting the authors of the wicked rebellion; for, when
   God commands them to retire from amongst them, He indirectly implies,
   that, if they remain mixed up with them, they shall share in the same
   destruction. Yet it is probable that the elders who "followed" Moses,
   held to his side, and continued firm in the performance of their duty.
   And, indeed, it is not at all consistent that Caleb and Joshua, and
   such like, were ever drawn away into so great a sin. We must not,
   therefore, take what is said of the whole congregation without
   exception. When Moses, in his delivery of God's command, does not
   address Korah, Dathan, and Abiram by their names, but calls them "these
   wicked men," it is not the reviling of anger, but an urgent mode of
   exhortation; for, had he not thus vehemently marked his detestation of
   them, there was danger lest his words should have been but coldly
   received by many, and lest they should have been of little avail. To
   the same effect also is what he immediately adds: "Lest ye be consumed
   in all their sins;" as if tie had said, Lest the contagion of so many
   and such great crimes should infect yourselves. Since they obeyed
   Moses, it is plain that many of the multitude had been carried away
   before by folly and levity, for deliberate iniquity would not have been
   so quickly or so easily corrected. But on the other hand, the marvelous
   stolidity of Dathan and Abiram is described, in that they came forth
   unawed, with their wives and children. Still it is not to be doubted
   but that they were terrified, after they saw themselves to be stripped
   of all aid and favor; but although the withdrawal of the people
   disturbed them, they nevertheless stood like maniacs; nor did fear
   subdue them or prevent them from proceeding in their fatal audacity to
   their doom. Thus [98] do the wicked often stand astounded, yet in their
   fear they by no means think of appeasing God.

   28. And Moses said, Hereby ye shall know. Moses now begins more clearly
   to show wherefore he has brought the rebels to this open contest, viz.,
   that God may sanction before the whole people, by a terrible exertion
   of His power, the system established by Himself. For it was no ordinary
   effort of confidence to concede the victory to His enemies, unless the
   earth should swallow them up alive. But, inasmuch as this was to be a
   most conspicuous judgment of God, he arouses their attention by the
   striking words he uses. If they should be cut off by a sudden death, he
   would have justly boasted that his cause was approved by God; but not
   content with this, he desires to be accounted a mere impostor, if they
   should die the common death of men. In order to express the strangeness
   of the miracle, whereby men's senses should be ravished, he employs the
   word create [99] emphatically; as much as to say, that the mode of
   their death would be no less unusual than as if God should add
   something to His creation, and change the face of the world. Thus
   David, when he prays that his enemies should go down alive into hell
   (infernos) or the grave, seems to allude to this history, (Psalm
   55:23;) for although that descent be understood to mean sudden death
   overtaking the wicked in a moment in the midst of their happiness and
   security, still, he at the same time indicates by it this horrible
   retribution, which had occurred in times past, inasmuch as memorable
   punishments pass into proverbial instances of God's wrath.

   34. And all Israel that were round about them. We must suppose that the
   people were standing around, expecting at a distance the event that was
   to take place; for they had previously retired from the tents, in token
   of their separation (from this wicked company.) [100] That they should
   now fly in confusion, lest the same destruction should overwhelm
   themselves, is a sign of their bad conscience, which is always troubled
   in itself, and agitates the wicked with sore inquietude. It is needful,
   indeed, that even the pious should be alarmed by God's judgments, in
   order that their consternation or dread should instruct them [101] in
   his holy fear, and therefore they never reflect without dread on the
   punishments which God has inflicted upon the crimes of men. But, since
   hypocrites carry in their hearts a hot iron, as it were, they fall down
   like dead men, as if the lightning fell from God upon their own heads.
   Thus we shall presently see that this blind fear profited them but
   little.

   35. And there came out a fire from the Lord. The diver-sky of the
   punishments had the effect of awakening more astonishment in the
   people, than as if all had been destroyed in the same manner, although
   God's anger raged more fiercely against the original authors of the
   evil, so as to make it manifest that each received a recompense
   according to the measure of his iniquity. He says that a fire went
   forth from Jehovah, because it was not kindled naturally, nor
   accidentally, but was accompanied by conspicuous marks, which showed
   that it was sent by Him. Yet I do not reject the opinions of others,
   viz., that God thundered from heaven, since thus His power would have
   been more manifestly exerted.

   37. Speak unto Eleazar the son of Aaron. Since there is no
   manifestation of God's wrath so conspicuous as not to be forgotten too
   often by man's stupidity, God was willing to anticipate this evil, and
   set up a monument for posterity, lest the recollection of this
   memorable judgment should ever be obscured. He commands, therefore,
   that a covering for the altar should be made of the censers, in order
   that none should rashly intrude himself to make the sacred offerings.
   When He calls them "hallowed," some understand that it was sinful to
   transfer them to profane purposes, because they had once been devoted
   to the service of God. I am, however, rather of opinion that they were
   set apart (sacratas) as things accursed (anathemata.) Thus the fire
   which had been upon them is scattered afar, in order that the altar
   should be cleansed from its pollution. Although, however, there was the
   same pollution in the censers, yet God would have them preserved as
   accursed, so that all posterity might understand that none but the
   priests were to be admitted to the sacrifices. Nor is it superfluous
   for Him to speak of the rebels as having acted criminally "against
   their own souls;" but it was in order that the memory of their
   punishment might be inn manner engraved upon those brazen enclosures,
   in order to awaken continued dread.

   40. To be a memorial unto the children of Israel. This passage again
   confirms what I have just said, that God's judgments, which ought to
   remain in full remembrance in every age, straightway escape, and are
   blotted out front men's minds, unless they are provided with certain
   aids to meditate upon them. This, however, does not happen so much from
   ignorance as neglect. Wherefore we ought to be the more attentive to
   the aids to memory, which may retain us in the path of duty.

   41. But on the morrow all the congregation. There is something more
   than monstrous in this madness of theirs. The conflagration was yet
   smoking, wherein God had appeared as the awful avenger of pride: the
   chasm in which the leaders of the rebellion had been swallowed up, must
   still have been almost before their eyes. God had commanded the plates
   to be molten, which might record that severe judgment through many
   succeeding ages. All had confessed by their alarm and hasty flight that
   there was danger lest they should themselves also be exposed to similar
   punishments. Yet, on the next day, am if they desired deliberately to
   provoke God, who was still, as it were, armed, they accuse God's holy
   servants of having been the authors of the destruction, though they had
   never lifted a finger against their enemies. Was it in the power of
   Moses to command the earth to open? Could he draw down the fire from
   heaven at his will? Since, then, both the chasm and the fire were
   manifest tokens of God's wonderful power, why do not these madmen
   reflect that they are engaging in fatal warfare against Him? For to
   what purpose was this extraordinary mode of punishment, except that in
   their terror they might learn to humble themselves beneath God's hand?
   Yet hence did they only derive greater wildness in their audacity, as
   if they desired to perish voluntarily with these sinners, whose
   punishment they had just been shuddering at. In two ways they betray
   their senselessness; first, by substituting Moses and Aaron as guilty
   of the murder, in place of God; and, secondly, by sanctifying these
   putrid corpses, as if in despite of God. They accuse Moses and Aaron of
   the slaughter, of which God had plainly shown Himself to be the author,
   as they themselves had been compelled to feel. But such is the
   blindness of the reprobate with respect to God's works, that His glory
   rather stupifies them than excites their admiration. The foulest
   ingratitude was also added; for they do not consider that only a very
   few hours had elapsed since they had been preserved by the intercession
   of Moses from impending destruction. Thus, in their desire to avenge
   the death of a few, they call those the killers of the people of the
   Lord, to whom they ought to have been grateful for the safety of all.
   Again, what arrogance it is to count among the people of God, as if
   against His will, those reprobates, when He had not only cut them off
   from His Church, but had also exterminated them from the world, and
   from the human race! But thus do the wicked wax wanton against God
   under the very cover of His gifts, and especially they do not hesitate
   to mock Him with empty titles and outward signs, as the masks of their
   iniquity.

   42. And it came to pass when the congregation. From the fact that Moses
   and Aaron were protected by the covering of the cloud, we gather how
   uncontrollable was the rage of the people. For, although the glory of
   God only stood over the tabernacle, so that Moses and Aaron were still
   exposed to stoning, and any other acts of violence, yet it so dazzled
   the eyes of these wicked men, that they could not touch the holy
   persons. Nor can we doubt but that they betook themselves to the
   sanctuary, because, in the extremity of their danger, the only hope
   that remained to them was in the help of God. When, therefore, they had
   fled to this sacred asylum, God received them under the shadow of His
   wings. Thus did He testify, that the prayers and hopes of His people
   are never in vain, but that He succors them whenever they call upon
   Him. For although, now-a-days, He does not appear in a visible abode,
   still He is nigh unto all those who cast their cares upon Him. It
   might, indeed, have been the case that the sign of God's glory was seen
   by none but Moses and Aaron, in order that they might be fully assured
   that God was near to help them; but, since the expression is
   indefinite, it is probable that God threatened also the frantic
   multitude, lest they should proceed to any further acts of violence,
   although the light was presented in vain to them in their blindness.

   45. Get you up from among this congregation. I have expounded the
   meaning of this expression a little above, namely, that as God regards
   His people with constant and peculiar love, so He defers His vengeance
   against the wicked, until these people are set apart, and placed in
   safety. For tie declares that, as soon as Moses and Aaron have secured
   themselves, all the rest shall perish in a moment. But incredible was
   the kindness of both of them, thus humbly to intercede for so
   ungrateful a people, who deserved to die a hundred times over; for,
   forgetful of their own lives, which they saw to be imperiled, they were
   ready to make atonement for the guilt, so as to rescue from death those
   abandoned wretches who were plotting their destruction. I do not,
   however, understand this, "Get you up," merely with reference to place,
   for they were already separated, having taken refuge in the tabernacle;
   but it is just as if God had commanded them to sever themselves from
   the people, and, quitting them altogether, and casting away all care
   for the public welfare, to provide for their own private safety.

   46. And Moses said unto Aaron. The expiation of so great a sin did not
   indeed depend on the incense-offering, nor are we to imagine that God
   is appeased by the savor of frankincense; but thus was a symbol set
   before this grosshearted people, whereby they might be alike aroused to
   repentance and faith; for however insensible they might be in their
   rebellion, yet the dignity of the priesthood was so conspicuous in the
   censer, that they ought to have been awakened by it to reverence. For
   who would not view his impiety with horror, when he is made conscious
   of having despised and violated that sanctity wherein the Divine power
   displays itself for life or death? The sight of the censer might have
   justly availed to subdue their hardness of heart, so that at last they
   might begin to condemn and detest their unrighteous act. The second
   warning which it gave them was no less profitable, i.e., that they
   might perceive that God was only propitiated towards them by virtue of
   a mediator; but., in so far as the actual state of things allowed, the
   visible type directed them to the absent Savior. Since, however, men
   corrupt and obscure the truth by their fond inventions, His majesty is
   asserted by the Divine institution of sacrifice. Whilst Aaron, the
   typical priest, stands forth, until the true, and only, and perpetual
   Mediator shall be revealed.

   The verb kphr, caphar, properly signifies, as I have said elsewhere, to
   reconcile God to men through the medium of an expiation (piaculum;)
   but, since here it refers to the people, the sense of Moses is rightly
   expressed by a single word, as one may say, to purge, or lustrate from
   pollution.

   48. And he stood between the living and the dead. If you understand
   that the living were everywhere mingled with the dead, you may
   conjecture that God's wrath did not so fall upon one part of the camp,
   as to destroy all that came in its way without exception, as had been
   the case in the other revolt, but that He selected those who had sinned
   most grievously. But it is probable that Aaron proceeded so far as to
   leave behind those who still remained uninjured, and, in the very place
   where the destruction had occurred, encountered the wrath of God, and
   arrested its course. Hence it was that both the fervor of his zeal
   might be the better perceived, and his office of appeasing God was more
   fully confirmed by its actual success. For what more evident miracle
   could be required, than when the slaughter, which had both begun to
   rage suddenly, and then to proceed in a course no less rapid than
   continuous, was stopped by the arrival of Aaron, exactly as if a hedge
   had been set up against it? The efficacy of the priesthood in
   propitiating God, is therefore both clearly and briefly set before us;
   and hence we are taught, that though we are so dose to the reprobate
   when they perish, as that their destruction should reach to ourselves,
   still that we shall be safe from all evil, if only Christ intercede for
   us.

   49. Now they that died in the plague. Already three hundred, or
   thereabouts, had been destroyed on account of the conspiracy made with
   Korah; now a much larger number was added. And this, forsooth, is what
   the wicked reap from their obstinacy, that God being more and more
   provoked redoubles His punishments; even as He threatens that, unless
   those whom He chastises shall repent, he will deal "seven times more"
   severely with them. (Leviticus 26:18.) Wherefore let us learn, when we
   are warned by His rebukes, to humble ourselves betimes beneath His
   mighty hand, since nothing is worse than to kick against the pricks;
   and let us always bear in mind what the psalm says,

   "Be ye not as the horse or as the mute, whose mouth must be held with
   bit and bridle; (because) many sorrows shall be to the wicked." (Psalm
   32:9, 10.)

   They rebelliously exclaimed that the people of the Lord were slain,
   when three hundred had perished; they now experience how much better it
   would have been to be dumb before God, and to give glory to His holy
   severity, than, instead of three hundred, to devote to destruction
   nearly fifty times as many. Let us, then, remember the admonition of
   Paul:

   "Let us beware lest we murmur, lest perchance the destroyer should
   destroy us," [102] (1 Corinthians 10:10;)

   for nothing is less tolerable in us than that we should frowardly
   presume to speak evil of God, when Scripture so often exhorts us to be
   silent in His presence.

   [86] A.V., "took men." There has been very much discussion among the
   commentators respecting this word. Holden says, "There is nothing in
   the Hebrew answering to the word men, and the verb is in the singular
   number; the received version, therefore, can scarcely be correct. The
   most easy and natural construction of the original is, And Korah took
   (i.e., won over, or drew into a conspiracy with him) both Dathan and
   Abiram,' etc. This agrees with other parts of Scripture which attribute
   this rebellion to Korah, chap. 27:3; Jude 11." And this appears to be
   the general opinion.

   [93] In the clause under consideration, 'l, El, is immediately followed
   by 'lhy, Elohey, the form given to Elohim, when it is to be used in
   connection with the next word. The different roots of El and Elohim
   seem to indicate that El has an especial reference to the power of the
   Deity, and Elohim to His authority as a judge. There being no
   practicable equivalent distinction in Latin or English, and the word
   Almighty being appropriated to rendering sdy, Shaddai, C. and our A.V.
   do but repeat the word God, whilst the V. and S.M. have fortissime
   Deus; but C. saw in S.M.'s notes, Aut sic, O Deus, Deus. -- W.

   [94] C.'s supposition, that the preposition l prefixed to all, is

   who think that our souls proceed from the substance of God. -- Fr. This
   doctrine of the Manicheans is often referred to in the writings of

   out by citations the following particulars: "Manichaeorum error circa
   animam. Docent animam nostram hoc esse quod Deus est; esse partem, seu
   particulam Dei; animas non solum hominum, sed etiam pecorum, de Dei
   esse substantia, et partes Dei asserunt." The word which I have
   translated transmission, is in the Latin ex traduce, a well-known
   metaphor in theological controversy, derived from the practice of
   inarching, or grafting by approach, when two neighboring branches are
   tied together so as to cohere and form one, whilst the parent stocks,
   to which they belong, continue still to possess a separate and
   individual vitality. Thus Prudentius, Apoth. 919-921. Vitandus tamen
   error erit, ne traduce carnis
   Transfundi in sobolem credatur fons animarum,
   Sanguinis exemplo, etc. C. makes frequent allusions to this heretical
   doctrine as having been resuscitated by Servetus, amongst his other
   pantheistic notions. See Instit. Book 1. ch. 15. Section 5. C. Soc.

   Numbers 17

   Numbers 17:1-13

   1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo,

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel, and take of every one of them a
   rod, according to the house of' their fathers, of all their princes,
   according to the house of' their fathers, twelve rods: write thou every
   man's name upon his rod.

   2. Alloquere filios Israel, et cape ab eis singulas virgas per domos
   patrum, a cunctis scilicet principibus eorum, juxta domos patrum
   suorum, duodecim virgas: et uniuscujusque nomen scribes super virgam
   ejus.

   3. And thou shalt write Aaron's name upon the rod of Levi: for one rod
   shall be for the head of the house of their fathers.

   3. Nomen autem Aharon scribes super virgam Levi: quia virga una erit
   capiti domus patrum suorum.

   4. And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle of the congregation
   before the testimony, where I will meet with you.

   4. Reponesque illas in tabernaculo conventionis coram testimonio ubi
   conveniam vobiscum.

   5. And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod, whom I shall choose,
   shall blossom; and I will make to cease from me the murmurings of the
   children of Israel, whereby they murmur against you.

   5. Et erit, vir ille quem elegero, illius virga florebit; et ita
   quiescere faciam a me murmurationes filiorum Israel quibus murmurant
   adversum vos.

   6. And Moses spoke unto the children of Israel, and every one of their
   princes gave him a rod apiece, for each prince one, according to their
   fathers' houses, even twelve rods; and the rod of Aaron was among their
   rods.

   6. Loquutus est ergo Moses ad filios Israel, et dederunt illi onmes
   principes eorum virgam; singuli principes virgam per domos patrum
   suorum, duodecim scilicet virgas; virga autem Aharon erat in medio
   virgarum eorum.

   7. And Moses laid up the rods before the Lord in the tabernacle of
   witness.

   7. Et posuit Moses virgas coram Jehova in tabernaculo testimonii.

   8. And it came to pass, that on the morrow Moses went into the
   tabernacle of witness; and, behold, the rod of Aaron, for the house of
   Levi, was budded, and brought forth buds, and bloomed blossoms, and
   yielded almonds.

   8. Et fuit, postridie venit Moses ad tabernaculum testimonii, et ecce
   germinaverat virga Aharon e domo Levi, ac produxerat germinationem,
   protuleratque flores, ad maturitatemque perduxerat amygdala.

   9. And Moses brought out all the rods from before the Lord unto all the
   children of Israel: and they looked, and took every man his rod.

   9. Et protulit Moses omnes virgas illas a facie Jehovae ad onmes filios
   Israel: qui viderunt, et acceperunt singuli virgam suam.

   10. And the Lord said unto Moses, Bring Aaron's rod again before the
   testimony, to be kept for a token against the rebels; and thou shalt
   quite take away their murmurings from me, that they die not.

   10. Dixit autem Jehova ad Mosen, Refer virgam Aharon coram testimonio
   in custodiam, in signum filiis rebellibus; et cessare facies
   murmurationes eorum apud me, ut non moriantur.

   11. And Moses did so: as the Lord commanded him, so did he.

   11. Et fecit Moses quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova, sic fecit.

   12. And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses, saying, Behold, we
   die, we perish, we all perish.

   12. Et dixerunt filii Israel ad Mosen, dicendo, Ecce mortui sumus,
   periimus, omnes nos periimus.

   13. Whosoever cometh any thing near unto the tabernacle of the Lord
   shall die: shall we be consumed with dying?

   13. Quicunque accesserit, qui accesserit, inquam, ad tabernaculum
   Jehovae, morietur; nunquid consumendi sumus moriendo?


   1. And the Lord spoke unto Moses. Howsoever stubborn the Israelites
   might be, yet their hardness of heart being now subdued, and their
   pride broken down, they ought to have acknowledged the authority of the
   priesthood, and to have perpetually held it in pious reverence. But it
   is plain from the confirmation of it, which is now added, that they
   were not yet thoroughly overcome. For God never appoints anything in
   vain; the remedy, therefore, was necessary, that He now applied to that
   disease of obstinacy which He perceived still to maintain its secret
   hold upon their hearts. Herein we also behold His inestimable goodness,
   when He not only had regard to the relief of their infirmity, but even
   struggled with their depravity and perverseness, in order to restore
   them to their senses. In the same way also He now deals with us, for he
   not only strengthens the weakness of our faith by many aids, but He
   puts constraint upon our light and inconstant minds, and retains us in
   the path of duty though we strive against Him. He likewise anticipates
   our willfulness, so as to keep us from growing presumptuous, or rouses
   us up when we are disposed to be slothful. In fact, his our business so
   to apply to our use whatever helps to faith and piety He sets before
   us, as to be assured that they are so many pieces of evidence to
   convict us of unbelief Although, therefore, the majesty of the
   priesthood had been already sufficiently, and more than sufficiently
   established, still God saw float in the extreme perversity of the
   people there would be no end to their murmurs and rebellions, unless
   the final ratification were added, and that, too, in a season of
   repose, inasmuch as, whilst the sedition was in progress, they were not
   so disposed and ready to learn. By this confirmation, then, He set
   aside whatever doubts could at any time arise, when Aaron's rod,
   severed as it was from the tree, was the only one of the twelve which
   blossomed. For it was no natural circumstance that a branch which
   derived no sap from the root, and which at that season of the year
   would have been dry upon the tree, should produce flowers and fruit,
   when it was east before the Ark of the Covenant, whilst the others,
   although altogether similar, remained dry and dead.

   2. Speak unto the children of Israel. They are mistaken who suppose
   that to the twelve rods there was another added for the tribe of Levi;
   [103] for, since there was no question here as to the possession of the
   land, there was no occasion at all for the division of the tribe of
   Joseph into two parts. We know, too, that it was endowed with a double
   portion, because the Levites had no inheritance; and in this case the
   circumstances were different, because all the other tribes were
   contending for the priesthood with the tribe of Levi alone. Hence it
   was, then, that rods were given to each of them, in accordance with the
   origin of their race. But, when Aaron's rod is said to have been "in
   the midst of them," [104] it is in the usual phrase of the Hebrew
   language, because it was mixed with them as one of their number. And
   this is expressly stated, to show us that all ground for caviling might
   be taken from the ungodly, since all the rods were east promiscuously
   into the same bundle, so that none should be distinguished above the
   others, and thus nothing could be ascribed to the collusion of men. If
   any should object that by these means the rivalry was not extinguished
   which the other Levites had with the house of Aaron, since his own name
   alone was inscribed upon the rod, so that there would be no comparison
   between the families; I reply, that since the power of God manifested
   itself distinctly in the name of Aaron, the rejection of the others was
   sufficiently shown forth by his election; for, if this honor had been
   common to the others, God would have defrauded them by giving
   distinction to him alone. Besides, no other plan could have been
   adopted for putting an end to this quarrel; for if there had been
   several rods for one tribe, the whole people would have complained of
   the inequality. It was necessary, then, that all should be brought to
   the contest on equal terms, so that the difference between them might
   be seen to depend upon God's good pleasure. But if the name of Levi had
   been inscribed, all its families would have claimed the right of
   succession, as if common to them all. There was, therefore, no other
   course open but that God should prefer to the whole people one
   individual chosen from amongst the members of his own kindred and
   tribe.

   4. And thou shalt lay them up in the tabernacle. The place itself had
   not a little to do with the effectual decision of the matter; because
   it was clearly manifested that God was the author of the miracle, and
   consequently that the priesthood proceeded from Him. For we have
   elsewhere said that the whole government of the Church so entirely
   depends upon His decree, that men are not permitted to interfere with
   it. Wherefore He set the ark of the covenant in opposition to the
   voices of the whole people, in order to testify that no further dispute
   was to be raised respecting the priest, whom He had appointed by His
   own declaration and authority. At the same time, it had the effect of
   consoling the people, and silencing their complaints that the rods of
   all the tribes were brought in common into the sanctuary before God;
   for, although a peculiar dignity was accorded to that of Aaron alone,
   still the people ceased not to be a priestly kingdom. Hence it follows,
   that the honorable privilege conferred on one family contributed to the
   public welfare of all; so far was it from being the case that their
   inferiority ought to have caused them pain or envy.

   5. And it shall come to pass, that the man's rod. Aaron, indeed, had
   been previously chosen; but the expression here refers to his
   manifestation; [105] because God is said again to choose those, whom He
   has chosen by His secret counsel, when He brings them forth into the
   sight of men with their peculiar marks of distinction; and this not
   once only, but as often as he confirms their election by new
   indications. And this seems to be spoken of by way of concession, as if
   God would pass over all His former decrees, and invite the people
   afresh to take cognizance of the matter. With this view tie states that
   He will put an end to all the malevolent and noisy detractions of the
   people, so that Aaron may henceforth exercise his office without
   controversy; for, although not even thus was their perverseness
   altogether cured, still their insolence was restrained.

   8. And it came to pass, that on the morrow. It is not without cause
   that, the time is notified, for by no skill could it be brought about
   that a rod should blossom in the lapse of a single night. Again, all
   suspicion of fraud was removed by the fact that Moses departed when he
   had placed the rods in the sanctuary, and, returning on the next day,
   brought out the bundle of rods before them all. But in this respect was
   the power of God principally shown forth, that in so short a space of
   time not only flowers, but fruits also, were formed upon a dry bough,
   which could not have occurred but by the reversal of the order of
   nature. And further, the time of year is to be taken into account,
   which was by no means in accordance with such maturity, Now, by this
   miracle the dignity of the typical priesthood was undoubtedly ratified
   to the ancient people under the Law; but, in so much as the truth
   itself is more excellent than its figure or image, the intention of God
   unquestionably was to assert the priesthood of His only-begotten Son
   rather than that of Aaron. Hence the profit to be derived from this
   miracle most especially pertains to us,("Nous appartient plus qu'aux
   Juifs;" pertains to us more than to the Jews. -- Fr.) in order that we
   may embrace the Priest presented to us by God with the veneration He
   deserves. I pass by the frivolous allegories [106] in which others take
   delight. And in fact it ought to be abundantly sufficient for us, that
   the power of God which might direct the people to the Mediator,
   appeared of old under a visible symbol; but when the Son of God came,
   whatever He then represented to their sight was spiritually revealed in
   Him: for not only was He a sprout (surculus) from the stem of Jesse, as
   He is called by Isaiah (Isaiah 11:1); and a stone hewn without the art
   or labor of man, under which form he was shown to Daniel (Daniel 2:34);
   but by His resurrection tie was separated from the whole human race.
   For this, too, we must diligently observe, that it is not enough that
   He should obtain with us the prerogative and title of Priest, unless He
   is so only and indivisibly. Hence it is plain that His honor is in the
   Papacy torn in pieces by foul and intolerable sacrilege, when they
   invent innumerable mediators.

   10. And the Lord said unto Moses. What God had prescribed concerning
   the censers, He now commands as to the rod, i.e., that it should be
   preserved as a monument for future ages; because men are forgetful and
   slow to consider His works, and not only so, but because they bury
   their memory as if of deliberate malice, he bids, therefore, and not
   without reproach, that this sign should be laid up in safety, saying,
   that this is done on account of their perverseness. At the same time,
   however, He commends His paternal love and pity, in that, whilst tie
   chastises their pride, He provides for their welfare. For, as they were
   given to rebellion, they would still have provoked His wrath by new
   murmurings. He says, then, that He anticipates them, and restrains
   their impetuous fury, lest they should die. Thus in humbling us, tie
   not only punishes our transgressions, but tie has regard to what is
   profitable for us, and proves that He cares for us.

   12. And the children of Israel spoke unto Moses. It was indeed somewhat
   better to be alarmed by admiration of God's power than as if they had
   despised it in brutal stupidity; but there is a medium between torpor
   or obstinacy, and consternation. It is true that believers tremble at
   the judgments of God, and, in proportion as each of us has advanced in
   piety, so we are the more affected by a sense of His anger. But this
   fear humbles believers in such a manner that they nevertheless seek
   after God; whilst the reprobate so tremble as fretfully to desire to
   drive God far away from them. Hence it arose that the Israelites,
   stunned as it were by God's severity, which they deemed excessive,
   deplored their wretched lot; for, inasmuch as they had no sense of
   God's goodness, the chastisement to them was like a gibbet rather than
   a medicine. They exclaim, therefore, that they are destroyed, because
   God so severely avenges His polluted worship; as if all such instances
   of rigor were not profitable for the purpose of rendering them more
   heedful and cautious. No doubt this servile fear sometimes prepares men
   for repentance; but nothing is more perilous than to rest in it,
   because it first engenders bitterness and indignation, and at length
   drives them to despair, Howsoever formidable, then, may be God's
   severity, let us learn at the same time to apprehend His mercy, so that
   we may be prepared to endure willingly with meek and quiet minds the
   punishments which we have deserved. In short, this passage shows how
   little progress the Israelites had made, since the rods of God so
   greatly exasperated them, that they cut themselves off from all hope of
   salvation. For this is the meaning of the words, "Shall we be consumed
   with dying?" as if it were not the case that God, on the contrary, was
   preserving them from death, when in His paternal solicitude He warned
   them of their danger.

   Numbers 20

   Numbers 20:1-13

   1. Then came the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, into
   the desert of Zin, in the first month: and the people abode in Kadesh;
   and Miriam died there, and was buried there.

   1. Pervenerunt autem filii Israel universa congregatio, in desertum
   Sin, mense primo, et mansit populus in Cades: ubi mortua est Maria, et
   sepulta illic fuit:

   2. And there was no water for the congregation: and they gathered
   themselves together against Moses and against Aaron.

   2. Quumque non esset aqua congregationi, convenerunt adversus Mosen et
   Aharon.

   3. And the people chode with Moses, and spoke, saying, Would God that
   we had died when our brethren died before the Lord!

   3. Et jurgatus est populus cum Mose, ac dixerunt in hunc modum, Et
   utinam obiissemus quando obierunt fratres nostri coram Jehova.

   4. And why have ye brought up the congregation of the Lord into this
   wilderness, that we and our cattle should die there?

   4. Et quare venire fecistis congregationem Jehovae in desertum istud:
   ut moriamur hic nos et jumenta nostra.

   5. And wherefore have ye made us to come up out of Egypt, to bring us
   in unto this evil place? it is no place of seed, or of figs, or of
   vines, or of pomegranates; neither is there ally water to drink.

   5. Et quare ascendere fecistis nos ex AEgypto, ut venire faceretis nos
   ad locum malum istum, non locum sementis, ficuum, et vinearum, et
   malogranatorum, et in quo aqua nulla est ad bibendum?

   6. And Moses and Aaron went from the presence of the assembly unto the
   door of the tabernacle of the congregation, and they fell upon their
   faces: and the glory of the Lord appeared unto them.

   6. Abierunt ergo Moses et Aharon a conspectu congregationis ad ostium
   tabernaculi conventionis, et projecerunt se super faciem suam:
   apparuitque gloria Jehovae super eos.

   7. And the Lord spoke unto Moses, saying,

   7. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   8. Take the rod, and gather thou the assembly together, thou and Aaron
   thy brother, and speak ye unto the rock before their eyes; and it shall
   give forth his water, and thou shalt bring forth to them water out of
   the rock: so thou shalt give the congregation and their beasts drink.

   8. Accipe virgam, et congrega coetum tu et Aharon frater tuus, et
   loquimini petrae in oculis eorum, et dabit aquam suam, educesque illis
   aquam e petra, et potum dabis coetui ac jumentis eorum.

   9. And Moses took the rod from before the Lord, as he commanded him.

   9. Tulit ergo Moses virgam a conspectu Jehovae, quemadmodum praeceperat
   ei:

   10. And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together before the
   rock, and he said unto them, Hear now, ye rebels; must we fetch you
   water out of this rock?

   10. Et congregaverunt Moses et Aharon congregationem ante petram,
   dixitque illis, Audite nunc o rebelles, Nunquid de petra hac educemus
   vobis aquam?

   11. And Moses lifted up his hand, and with his rod he smote the rock
   twice; and the water came out abundantly, and the congregation drank,
   and their beasts also.

   11. Et elevavit Moses manum suam, percussitque petram virga sua duabus
   vicibus: tunc egressae sunt aquae multae, et bibit congregatio ac
   jumenta eorum.

   12. And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron, Because ye believed me
   not, to sanctify me in the eyes of the children of Israel, therefore ye
   shall not bring this congregation into the land which I have given
   them.

   12. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon, Propterea quod non credidistis
   mihi, ut sanctificaretis me in oculis filiorum Israel, idcirco non
   introducetis congregationem istam in terram quam dedi illis.

   13. This is the water of Meribah; because the children of Israel strove
   with the Lord, and he was sanctified in them.

   13. Istae sunt aquae jurgii, pro quibus jurgati sunt filii Israel cum
   Jehova, et sanctificavit se in illis.


   1. Then came the children of Israel. In the twenty-third chapter of
   this book many intermediate stations are mentioned, which are not here
   referred to: perhaps because, from the time that God compelled them to
   draw back, they had made no advance for thirty whole years, but had
   wandered about by circuitous paths. In connecting the history,
   therefore, in this place he relates that they passed from the desert of
   Paran to the desert of Sin; because they then began to direct their
   journey straight towards the land of Canaan, and to advance more
   closely to it, so as at length to conclude their wanderings. When he
   tells us that Miriam died here, we may infer from hence that her life
   was greatly prolonged. It is probable that she was a girl of ten or
   twelve years of age, when Moses was born, since she was able to provide
   adroitly for his safety, (Exodus 2:4;) for although her name is not
   actually given, yet it may be reasonably supposed that she was the
   person who fetched her mother to nurse the child that had been exposed.
   She reached the age, then, of about 130 years, [107] an unusual length
   of life, and especially for a woman.

   2. And there was no water for the congregation. We have already seen a
   similar, though not the same, history. For, when the people had hardly
   come out of Egypt, they began to rebel in Rephidim on account of the
   scarcity of water; and now, after thirty-eight years, or thereabouts, a
   new sedition arose in Kadesh, because there, too, they wanted water.
   Their first murmuring, indeed, sufficiently showed how great was their
   depravity and contumacy; for, when God gave them their food from heaven
   every day, why did they not supplicate Him for water, so that their
   sustenance might be complete? Yet, not less with foul ingratitude than
   with impious refractoriness, they assail God with reproaches, and
   complain that they are deceived and betrayed. But this second rebellion
   is far worse; for, when they had experienced that it was in God's power
   to extract plenty of water from the barren rock, why do they not now
   implore His aid? why does not that marvelous interference in their
   behalf recur to their minds? Yet, in their madness, they clamor that
   they have been more cruelly dealt with than as if they had been
   swallowed up by the earth, or consumed by fire from heaven, as if there
   were no remedy for their thirst. Assuredly this was incredible
   stupidity, designedly, as it were, to shut the gate of God's grace, and
   to east themselves into despair. It is true that they rebel against
   Moses and Aaron; but they direct their complaints like darts against
   God Himself. They deem it a very great injustice that they had been
   brought into the desert, as if they had not in their own impious
   obstinacy themselves preferred the desert to the land of Canaan, and
   were deserving, therefore, of pining, in want of all things, to death
   itself. Perversely, then, do they throw the blame, which belongs to
   themselves alone, upon the ministers of their salvation. With truth,
   indeed, do they call the place evil and barren; but God would not have
   wished to keep them imprisoned there, unless they had voluntarily
   refused the land flowing with milk and honey, after it had been set
   before their eyes, and an easy entrance to it had been accorded to them
   under the guidance and authority of God. Thus the Prophet, in Psalm
   105, in recounting the history of their redemption, before he descends
   to the punishments inflicted upon their sins, relates that they were
   brought forth by God "with joy" and "with gladness." [108] But,
   further, taking occasion from the inconvenience they experienced from
   thirst, they maliciously heap together other complaints. There was no
   lack of food to satisfy their hunger, and such as was pleasant to the
   taste; yet they complain exactly as if hunger oppressed them as well as
   thirst. God daily rained for them food from heaven, which it was mere
   sport for them to gather; but the ground of their murmuring is that
   they had not to fatigue themselves with ploughing and sowing. Behold to
   what senselessness men are driven by preposterous lust, and by contempt
   of God's present blessings! The climax of their madness, however, is
   that they lament their fate in not having been swallowed up with Korah
   and his companions, or consumed by fire from heaven. They had been
   overwhelmed with great fear at that melancholy spectacle; and justly
   so, for God had exhibited a prodigy, terrible throughout all ages. Now
   they quarrel with Him because His lightnings did not smite them also.
   Nor do they only lament that they were not destroyed by that particular
   kind of death, but they willfully provoke God's vengeance upon their
   heads, which ought to have terrified them more than a hundred deaths:
   for it is emphatically added, that those, with whom they desired to be
   associated, had "died before the Lord." They acknowledge, therefore,
   that the destruction, which they imprecate upon themselves, had come to
   pass not by chance, but by the manifest judgement of God, as if they
   were angry with God for having spared themselves. Most truly do they
   call them their brethren, to whom they were only too like; yet is it in
   brutal arrogance that they desire to be accounted God's Church; for,
   whilst they professedly connect themselves with the adverse faction,
   they arrogate falsely this title to themselves.

   6. And Moses and Aaron went from the presence. It is probable that they
   fled in fear, inasmuch as the tabernacle was a kind of refuge for them
   from the violence of the people. Still, we may conjecture from other
   passages that they had consideration not only for themselves, but for
   the wretched people, howsoever unworthy of it they might be so also,
   when they throw themselves upon their faces, I understand that they did
   so, not so much (to pray) that God would protect them from the wrath of
   their enemies, but also that He would calm these madmen by some
   appropriate remedy. Still their agitation appears to have been such as
   to deprive them of their ordinary self-restraint. Neither, indeed, does
   God try their faith and patience, as He often did on other occasions;
   perhaps because He saw that they were too much overwhelmed to be able
   to persevere inflexibly in pious zeal, patience, and care for the
   public good. Consequently the appearance to them of God's glory was a
   support for their weakness, as in a case of extremity.

   This example shows us how earnestly God should be entreated constantly
   to support us with new supplies of His grace, since otherwise the
   boldest of us all would fail at every moment. The invincible resolution
   of Moses had so often overcome every obstacle, that there seemed to be
   no fear of his being in danger of falling; yet the conqueror in so many
   struggles at length stumbles in a single act. Hence we should more
   carefully bear in mind the exhortation of Paul: Because

   "it is God which worketh in us both to will and to do of his good
   pleasure," we should "work out our own salvation with fear and
   trembling." (Philippians 2:12, 13.)

   8. Take the rod. It is unquestionable that the faith of Moses had now
   begun to waver; but we gather from his prompt obedience that it had not
   altogether failed; for he wastes no time in discussion, but comes
   straight to the rock in order that he may perform God's command. His
   faith, then, was only so smothered, that its hidden rigor at once
   directed him to his duty. Thus is it that the saints sometimes, whilst
   they totter like children, still advance toward their mark.

   By the sight of "the rod," God would recall both to Moses and the
   people so many miracles, which were well fitted to awaken confidence
   for the future; just as if He were uplifting the standard of His power.
   The command to speak to the rock is not unattended with a severe
   reproach, as if He had said, that in the lifeless elements there was
   more reason and intelligence than in men themselves. And assuredly it
   was a thing much to be ashamed of, that the rock, as if it could hear
   and was endued with sense, should obey God's voice, whilst the people,
   to whom the Law had been given, remained in deafness and stupidity.

   10. And Moses and Aaron gathered the congregation together. There is no
   doubt but that Moses was perplexed between hope and doubt, so that,
   although he committed the event to God, he was still to a certain
   extent oppressed with anxiety; for he would never have been so ready
   and prompt in obeying, and especially in such an unusually arduous
   matter, if he had been without faith. Aaron and himself had recently
   hidden themselves in alarm; it was, therefore, a task of no slight
   difficulty straightway to call the people, from whom they had fled, and
   voluntarily to encounter their madness. Thus far, then, we see nothing
   but a readiness to obey, conjoined with magnanimity, which is deserving
   of no common praise; but inasmuch as the unbelief of Moses is condemned
   by the heavenly Judge, in whose hands is the sovereign power, and at
   whose word we all stand or fall, we must acquiesce in His sentence. We
   scarcely perceive anything reprehensible in this matter, yet, since God
   declares that the fall of Moses displeased Him, we must abide by His
   decision rather than our own. And hence, too, let us learn that our
   works, on the surface of which nothing but virtue is apparent, are
   often abounding in secret defects, which escape the eyes of men, but
   are manifest to God alone.

   If it be asked in what respect Moses transgressed, the origin of his
   transgression was unbelief; for it is not allowable, when this species
   of sin is expressly referred to in the answer of God, to imagine that
   it was anything else. But it is doubtful in what point he was
   incredulous; unless it be, that in asking whether he could fetch water
   out of the rock, he seems to reject as if it were impossible and absurd
   what God had promised to do. And, in fact, he was so entirely taken up
   by considerations of their contumacy, that he did not acknowledge the
   grace of God. He inquires whether he shall fetch water out of the rock?
   whereas he ought to have recollected that this had already been
   permitted to him by God. It became him, then, confidently to assert
   that God had again promised the same thing, rather than to speak with
   hesitation.

   Others think that he sinned, because he was not contented with a single
   blow, but smote the rock twice. And this perhaps did arise from
   distrust. But the origin of the fault was that he did not simply
   embrace God's promise, and strenuously discharge the duty assigned to
   him as an evidence of his faith. Although, therefore, his smiting the
   rock twice might have been a token of his want of confidence, still it
   was only an aggravation of the evil, and not its origin or cause. Thus,
   then, we must always come back to this, that Moses did not give God the
   glory, because he rather considered what the people had deserved, than
   estimated the power of God according to His word. And this, too, has
   previous reprimand denotes, when, in accusing the Israelites of
   rebellion, he shows, indeed, that he was inflamed with holy zeal; yet,
   at the same time, he does not bestir himself with suitable confidence
   in order to their conviction; nay, in a manner he confesses that the
   power of God fails beneath their wickedness. Thus it is said in Psalm
   106:32, 33,

   "That it went in with Moses for their sakes, because they provoked his
   spirit, so that he spoke with his mouth:" [109]

   for the Prophet does not there excuse Moses; but shows that in
   consequence of the wickedness of the people, he was carried away by
   inconsiderate fervor, so as to deny that what God had promised should
   take place. Hence let us learn that, when we are angered by the sins of
   others, we should beware lest a temptation of an opposite kind should
   take possession of our minds.

   12. And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron. God here both sets forth
   their crime, and pronounces its punishment. Now, whilst unbelief is in
   itself a gross and detestable evil, God aggravates its guilt by
   declaring its consequence, viz., that He was defrauded of His glory,
   when Moses and Aaron, who ought to have been the proclaimers of the
   miracle, lay as it were confounded with shame. For, whereas their
   confidence, by exciting attention, would have sanctified God's name, so
   by their mistrust it came to pass that all were led to think that there
   was nothing to be hoped from His assistance.

   When Moses not only ingenuously confesses his guilt, but also relates
   how he was condemned by God, and, in order that his disgrace may be
   more complete, introduces Him speaking as from His judgment-seat, this
   does not a little tend to establish the truth of his doctrine. For what
   human being, unless he had renounced all carnal affections, would
   voluntarily endure to declare himself guilty before all the world? His
   angelic virtues were sufficient to exempt him from all suspicion.
   Having erred in one particular only, he proclaims the disgrace which he
   might have concealed, and does not hesitate to disparage himself, in
   order to magnify the goodness of God. And surely it is obvious from the
   passage that, whenever God had before pardoned the people at the
   request of Moses, the pardon was no less gratuitous than as if he had
   not interceded for them. For the intercession of Moses ceases on this
   occasion, yet God does nod; fail to deal kindly with them in their
   unworthiness, according to His wont.

   13. This is the water of Meribah. [110] This name was given: to the
   place in order that the ingratitude of their fathers might be
   detestable to their descendants, and hence the mercy of God more
   illustrious. Thus the Prophet, referring to it, says:

   "That the generation to come might know them, -- that they might not
   forget the works of God, -- and might not be as their fathers, a
   stubborn and rebellious generation; a generation that set not their
   heart aright, and whose spirit was not steadfast with God."
   (Psalm 78:6, 7, 8.)

   And elsewhere both the name of Meribah and that of Massah are employed,
   in order that the Israelites might learn not to imitate their fathers,
   (Psalm 95:8; [111] )although Moses here uses the plural number, whereas
   he has the singular in Exodus 17.

   The expression at the end of the verse, that God "was sanctified" among
   the children of Israel, is not used in approval, but rather in reproof,
   of their conduct. Israel is called elsewhere God's "holiness," [112]
   (Psalm 114:2,) because God magnificently displayed tits glory in their
   deliverance; but He is here said to have sanctified Himself in a
   different sense, because, by the overthrow of their iniquity and
   frowardness, He rescued his holy name from contempt. In fine, it was a
   proof of his inestimable mercy, that the water, which might have justly
   been destructive to them, was not only given to be the sustenance of
   their bodies, but also was converted into an aid for their salvation;
   for which reason Paul says that this was "spiritual drink." (1
   Corinthians 10:4.)

   A Reputation of the same History

   Deuteronomy 1

   Deuteronomy 1:37, 38

   37. Also the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, saying, Thou also
   shalt not go in thither.

   37. Etiam contra me iratus est Jehova propter vos, dicendo: Etiam tu
   non ingredieris illuc.

   38. But Joshua the son of Nun, which standeth before thee, he shall go
   in thither: encourage him; for he shall cause Israel to inherit it.

   38. Jehosua filius Nun, qui stat coram te, ipse ingredietur illuc:
   ipsum robora, quandoquidem illam in haereditatem distribuet Israeli.


   37. Also the Lord was angry with me. It is in no cowardly spirit that
   he transfers to them the guilt of unfaithfulness, which he had
   confessed for himself; but, since he had only fallen in consequence of
   being overwhelmed by their obstinate wickedness, he justly reproaches
   them with the fact that God was wroth with him on account of their sin.
   If under this pretext he had attempted to extenuate his guilt before
   God, or to substitute their criminality for his own, he would have done
   nothing else than double the evil: but, in reproving the people, he
   rightly and appropriately complained that the cause of his sin had
   arisen from them. As if he had said that they were so perverse that
   even he had been corrupted by them, and drawn into association with
   their guilt and its punishment. He here, however, adds respecting
   Joshua what he had before passed over in silence. His appointment as
   successor to Moses served to encourage the people; for it was a notable
   ground for hope that they should hear a provision already made, that
   after the death of Moses they should not be destitute of a leader, who
   would rule them under the auspices of God.

   Why God preferred this man to all others, especially when Caleb is more
   highly praised elsewhere, is only known to Himself. We know that He
   chooses according to His own will those whom He destines to any charge,
   so that the dignity of men may depend upon His gratuitous favor. "To
   stand before" a person is equivalent to being at hand to do his
   bidding; and it seems that this was stated to be the condition of
   Joshua, in order that the punishment might be more manifest; inasmuch
   as, by an entire inversion, a successor is given to Moses, who had been
   his servant.

   Numbers 20

   Numbers 20:14-22

   14. And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh unto the king of Edom, Thus
   saith thy brother Israel, Thou knowest all the travel that hath
   befallen us;

   14. Misit autem Moses nuntium e Cades ad regem Edom, Sic dicit frater
   tuns Israel, Tu nosti omnem laborem qui apprehendit nos.

   15. How our fathers went down into Egypt, and we have dwelt in Egypt a
   long time; and the Egyptians vexed us and our fathers:

   15. Quia descenderunt patres nostri in AEgyptum, et mansimus in AEgypto
   diebus multis, afflixeruntque nos AEgyptii, et patres nostros.

   16. And when we cried unto the Lord, he heard our voice, and sent an
   angel, and hath brought us forth out of Egypt; and, behold, we are in
   Kadesh, a city in the uttermost of thy border.

   16. Et clamavimus ad Jehovam, qui exaudivit vocem nostram, et misit
   angelum qui nos eduxit ex AEgypto. Et ecce, sumus in Cades, urbe in
   extremitate termini tui.

   17. Let us pass, I pray thee, through thy country: we will not pass
   through the fields, or through the vineyards, neither will we drink of
   the water of the wells: we will go by the king's high-way, we will not
   turn to the right hand nor to the left, until we have passed thy
   borders.

   17. Transeamus, agedum, per terram tuam, non transibimus per agros aut
   per vineas, neque bibemus aquam putei, via regia gradiemur: neque
   declinabimus ad dexteram aut ad sinistram, donec transierimus terminum
   tuum.

   18. And Edom said unto him, Thou shalt not pass by me, lest I come out
   against thee with the sword.

   18. Cui respondit Edom, Non transibis per me, ne forte cum gladio
   egrediar in occursum tui.

   19. And the children of Israel said unto him, We will go by the
   high-way; and if I and my cattle drink of thy water, then I will pay
   for it: I will only (without doing any thing else) go through on my
   feet.

   19. Et dixerunt ei filii Israel, Per viam ascendemus: quod si aquas
   tuas biberimus ego et animalia mea, dabo pretium illarum. Tantummodo
   sine negotio transeam pedibus meis.

   20. And he said, Thou shalt not go through. And Edom came out against
   him with much people, and with a strong hand.

   20. Verum dixit, Non transibis. Et egressus est in occursum ejus cum
   populo multo, et manu forti.

   21. Thus Edom refused to give Israel passage through his border:
   wherefore Israel turned away from him.

   21. Renuit igitur Edom permittere Israeli, ut transiret per terminum
   suum: tunc Israel declinavit ab eo.

   22. And the children of Israel, even the whole congregation, journeyed
   from Kadesh, and came unto mount Hor.

   22. Et profecti sunt e Cades, veneruntque filii Israel, tota
   congregatio ad montem Hor.


   14. And Moses sent messengers from Kadesh. His first narrative does not
   explain the cause of the embassy, but from the account in Deuteronomy
   it is plain float peace [113] was sought for from the Edomites as
   brethren by the command of God. God, therefore, prescribes the
   conditions of peace and war; lest the Israelites should rashly attack
   ally, who were not to be reckoned enemies, although they might act
   towards them with little humanity. Undoubtedly this would seem hard to
   His people that they were to leave a country, which was close to them,
   untouched, and to seek a more distant place of abode. But God restrains
   their impatience for a twofold reason; first, because it was unjust and
   by no means humane to assail their kindred; and both these nations were
   descended from Isaac, and their original ancestors were twin brothers.
   Circumcision, too, was common to them both, a mark of their being' of
   the same origin, and a bond of fraternal connection. But the other
   reason ought to have had more weight in restraining them, because it
   was unlawful to cast the children of Esau out of the possession, which
   they had obtained by a similar right as that whereby the land of Canaan
   had been promised to the posterity of Jacob. If, therefore, they
   desired to enjoy their own inheritance, the decree was not to be
   violated which God had pronounced by the mouth of Isaac, (Genesis
   27:39;) especially since Esau the founder of the race (of the Edomites)
   had fixed his home in Mount Seir by the secret inspiration of God, and
   to that place had his posterity beck confined. God, therefore, now
   admonishes them that it would have been an act of sacrilegious
   audacity, if the Israelites should attempt to overthrow the prophecy of
   Isaac, by which Esau had been declared the possessor of a rich and
   fertile soil.

   A Repetition of the same History

   Deuteronomy 2

   Deuteronomy 2:2-8

   2. And the Lord spoke unto me, saying,

   2. Postea loquutus est ad me Jehova, dicendo:

   3. Ye have compassed this mountain long enough: turn you northward.

   3. Sufficit vobis circuisse montem istum: convertite vos ad aquilonem.

   4. And command thou the people, saying, Ye are to pass through the
   coast of your brethren the children of Esau, which dwell in Self, and
   they shall be afraid of you: take ye good heed unto yourselves
   therefore.

   4. Populo autem praecipe dicendo, Vos nunc transituri estis per
   terminum fratrum vestrorum filiorum Esau qui habitabant in Seir:
   timebunt autem a vobis, cavete diligenter:

   5. Meddle not with them; for I will not give you of their laud, no, not
   so much as a foot-breadth; because I have given mount Seir unto Esau
   for a possession.

   5. Ne irritetis eos, non enim daturus sum vobis de terra eorum usque ad
   calcationem plantae pedis: quia in haereditatem ipsi Esau dedi montem
   Seir.

   6. Ye shall buy meat of them for money, that ye may eat; and ye shall
   also buy water of them for money, that ye may drink.

   6. Cibum emetis ab eis argento, et comedetis: et etiam aquam emetis ab
   eis argento, et bibetis.

   7. For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee in all the works of thy hand:
   he knoweth thy walking through this great wilderness: these forty years
   the Lord thy God hath been with thee; thou hast lacked nothing.

   7. Siquidem Jehova Deus tuus benedixit tibi in onmi opere manus tuae,
   et novit quod ambules per desertum magnum istud: jam quadraginta annis
   Jehova Deus tuus fuit tecum, neque indiguisti aliquo.

   8. And when we passed by from our brethren the children of Esau, which
   dwelt in Seir, through the way of the plain from Elath, and from
   Ezion-gaber, we turned and passed by the way of the wilderness of Moab.

   8. Et transivimus a fratribus nostris filiis Esau, qui habitabant in
   Seir, per viam solitudinis ab Elath et ab Esion-gaber: conversi autem
   transivimus ad viam deserti Moab.


   4. And they shall be afraid of you. This temptation was the more
   provoking, when they heard not only that the embassy would be vain, but
   that although Edom should receive them with injustice and hostility,
   they were still to abstain from violence and arms. For there might be
   some reason in this, that when they presented their request in a
   friendly manner, they would have a legitimate cause of war, if Edom
   should reject their demands. But this further condition might appear
   altogether intolerable that they were to do nothing against those who
   refused to let them pass quietly through their land. Hence, however, it
   more fully appears how the Israelites were gradually, and by various
   kinds of chastisement, subdued to obedience, whereas they would
   otherwise have fiercely and petulantly exclaimed that they had been
   dealt with unkindly by God; since thus their condition would be worse
   than the universal law of nations allowed. In this matter, then, their
   wanderings, for eight and thirty years, had much efficacy in bringing
   them back to the right way.

   Numbers 20:14. Thou knowest all the travel that hath befallen us. This
   preface was well calculated to conciliate favor, when the sons of
   Jacob, descended from the same blood, familiarly approached the
   Edomites: for their connection ought to have rendered them hospitable.
   But there are two principal points whereby Moses endeavored to
   influence the mind of the king of Edom, so that he should grant them a
   passage through his dominions. The first is derived from the ordinary
   feelings of humanity; for nature dictates that aid should be extended
   to the wretched, who are unjustly oppressed. In this view, he says,
   that the afflictions which they had endured were notorious; viz., that
   as sojourners in Egypt they had been tyrannically harassed and
   oppressed. In saying that "the Egyptians vexed us and our fathers,"
   although they were not, at that time, endowed with capacity for
   estimating the injuries inflicted upon them [114] yet it is not without
   reason that they complain that these injuries had been inflicted on
   themselves, which affected their whole body and name, especially since
   the final act of cruelty directly concerned them, when Pharaoh
   commanded all the male infants to be destroyed. The second argument is
   more effective: since nothing can be less in accordance with propriety
   than to deny our assistance to those whoso welfare God recommends to us
   by His own example. In order, then, that they may obtain help from
   their brethren, they make mention of the grace of God, which at that
   time might have been everywhere celebrated. When, therefore, this
   message is given to their ambassadors, We cried unto the Lord, who hath
   heard us, their design was to exhort the Edomites to be imitators of
   God, who had been merciful in delivering His people. If any should
   object that the cry of the people had not been praiseworthy, as not
   having arisen from a true and sincere faith, nor from a serious feeling
   of the heart, the reply is easy. that the Israelites were not here
   boasting of any merit of their own, as if they had prayed duly and
   perfectly, but that they were simply professing their innocence, since
   they could not have had recourse to God, unless they had been unjustly
   oppressed. The fact, then, that God had heard them, had the effect of
   commending their cause. They prove, however, from the result, that God
   was their deliverer: because their exodus had been incredible; although
   this point is but lightly touched upon.

   Their notion is a poor one, who understand Moses by "the angel:" since
   by this name they unquestionably magnify the miracles which God had
   wrought. [115] Now, although the angels encamp around the servants of
   God -- and it is certain that many angels had been the ministers of the
   people's safety -- still they especially designate, as the angel, Him
   who had been often before called Jehovah, and in whom the, majesty of
   God perfectly shone forth. Paul, however, teaches that he was Christ.
   (1 Corinthians 10:4.)

   19. And the children of Israel said unto him. It is doubtful whether or
   not the ambassadors were sent a second time, in order to remove all
   unjust suspicions, and to appease the ferocity (of the Edomites.) It is
   probable, however, that we have the relation of what was done in one
   and the same expedition. The sum is, that the Israelites tried every
   means, in order that a free and unmolested passage might be accorded
   them by the Edomites: whence their repulse might appear the more harsh
   and intolerable. But God, by this test, would prove the obedience of
   His people. As regards the Edomites, although by rashly taking up arms
   they would have drawn upon themselves just destruction, still God
   spared them for a time; not by freely pardoning them, but by deferring
   their punishment, as He is wont to do, until its due season.

   Deuteronomy 2:7 For the Lord thy God hath blessed thee. This reason is
   added, lest the people should be grieved at spending their money, of
   which they had not much, in buying meat and drink. There are, however,
   two clauses; first, that they were so enriched by God's bounty, that
   they were fully supplied with the means of buying food; and, secondly,
   that they must not doubt but that He would relieve their necessity, if
   it were required, since He had thus far provided for them, and had not
   suffered them to want anything. He, therefore, encourages them to hope,
   in consideration of their past experience; because God would take care
   of them, as tie had before been accustomed to do.

   The question, however, arises, how God could say, that He had blessed
   the work of their hands, when they had had no commerce with other
   nations, so as to make the smallest gains whatever. But I thus
   understand it, viz., that although they were gratuitously sustained in
   the wilderness, and had not expended a single penny in buying even
   shoelatchets, still their cattle had increased, and, besides, they had
   made some profits by their daily labor; not by receiving, indeed, daily
   wages, but by providing for themselves furniture and other necessaries.

   Numbers 20

   Numbers 20:23-29

   23. And the Lord spoke unto Moses and Aaron in mount Hor, by the coast
   of the land of Edom, saying,

   23. Dixit autem Jehova ad Mosen et Aharon in monte Hor, in finibus
   terrae Edom, dicendo:

   24. Aaron shall be gathered unto his people; for he shall not enter
   into the land which I have given unto the children of' Israel, because
   ye rebelled against my word at the water of Meribah.

   24. Congregabitur Aharon ad populos suos.: Non enim ingredietur terram
   quam dedi filiis Israel: eo quod rebelles fueritis ori meo in aquis
   jurgii.

   25. Take Aaron and Eleazar his son, and bring them up unto mount Hor;

   25. Accipe Aharon et Eleazar filium ejus, et ascendere fac eos in Hor
   montem.

   26. And strip Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar his son:
   and Aaron shall be gathered unto his people, and shall die there.

   26. Tunc exues Aharon vestibus suis, quibus indues Eleazar filium ejus:
   quia Aharon colligetar, et morietur ibi.

   27. And Moses did as the Lord commanded: and they went up into mount
   Hor, in the sight of all the congregation.

   27. Fecitque Moses quemadmodum praeperat Jehova. Et ascenderunt in Hor
   montem in oculis totius congregationis.

   28. And Moses stripped Aaron of his garments, and put them upon Eleazar
   his son; mid Aaron died there in the top of the mount: and Moses and
   Eleazar came down from the mount.

   28. Et exuit Moses Aharon vestibus suis, et induit illis Eleazar filium
   ejus, mortuusque est Aharon ibi in vertice montis. Tunc descendit Moses
   et Eleazar de monte.

   29. And when all the congregation saw that Aaron was dead, they mourned
   for Aaron thirty days, even all the house of Israel.

   29. Videns autem tota congregatio quod obiisset Aharon, fleverunt eum
   triginta diebus tota domus Israel.


   23. And the Lord spoke unto Moses. First of all, in the death of Aaron,
   we must consider the execution of the sentence, whereby he had been
   condemned; for God wished to show that He had not threatened either him
   or Moses in vain, with what then occurred, as children are wont to be
   threatened. If Aaron had died without any such prediction, since he
   might have seemed from his extreme age to have but discharged the debt
   of nature, as it is called, the people might have been so overcome by
   their grief, as to have no inclination to proceed. But now, when, in
   the death of one man, the condemnation of their public and common guilt
   is clearly manifested, such great severity on God's part against the
   high-priest, who had before propitiated God towards them all by his
   intercession, must have been a very sharp spur to them all. For it must
   needs have suggested itself to them, that God was no longer to be
   trifled with, before whom not even this sacred dignity could escape
   punishment. This was the reason why Aaron was called forth to die in
   the sight of all, that the survivors might learn to live to God,
   inasmuch as He instructed them to obey by this notable example. For the
   rebuke is added not so much for the sake of Moses and Aaron, viz., that
   they should not enter the land, because they had been rebellious
   against God's word, as that the people might perceive that they
   deserved to perish ten times over; since, by their contumacy, they had
   exasperated the holy men, so that in the excess of their zeal they had
   almost fallen away from the faith.

   25. Take Aaron and Eleazar his son. Aaron's successor was to be
   designated whilst he was himself still living; first of all, that the
   perpetuity of the priesthood might be secured; and, secondly, lest the
   people, with their usual temerity, should take upon themselves the
   election in a matter depending on the will of God, alone. For, unless
   Eleazar had been appointed priest whilst his father was yet alive, the
   office itself might fall into disesteem, since the high dignity of any
   individua! is often odious. Lest, therefore, their perverse envy might
   impel them to repudiate the priesthood, God anticipates them, and
   provides that religion, which ought to be perpetual, should not perish
   together with the men. Again, we know how great was the audacity of
   this people in innovation; lest, then, they should, at their own
   caprice, take to themselves a priest from another tribe, it was well
   that he of whom God approved, should be firmly established, so as to be
   received without controversy as the true and lawful one. In this matter
   an external symbol was made use of, in that Eleazar was invested with
   the sacred garments; nor does this refer to the shirt, or the slippers,
   but to the sacerdotal ornaments. The effect, therefore, of this
   ceremony was as if Aaron should resign the office, which he had
   discharged till that day, to his son. Moreover, it is worthy of
   observation that Aaron not only voluntarily cedes his dignity, but his
   life also. By this proof his faith was confirmed, for had he not been
   persuaded that an inheritance was laid up for him in heaven, he would
   not have so calmly migrated from the world. Since, however, he composes
   himself to die, just as if he were but lying down on his bed, it is
   altogether beyond a doubt that his mind was lifted up to the hope of a
   blessed resurrection, from whence arises a cheerful readiness to die.
   And it is probable that his faith was elevated and strengthened when he
   saw that the testimony of God's grace, on which the safety of the
   people depended, was made to rest upon the person of his son. For it
   was exactly as if the image of the Mediator were set visibly before his
   eyes. This consolation, then, being of no ordinary character, rendered
   him superior to the terrors of death. Meanwhile, Eleazar succeeded, in
   the presence of the people, so that his authority might not hereafter
   be exposed to their murmurs.

   29. And when all the congregation saw. This has been an error common to
   almost all nations and ages, but which reigned peculiarly amongst the
   people of Israel -- to pay due honor to God's holy servants, rather
   after their deaths than in their lives. They had frequently wished to
   stone Aaron; they had raised great tumults, in order to cast him down
   from the dignity in which God had placed him; now, forgetting their
   malignity and envy, they lament for him when dead.

   The question, however, occurs, whether the mourning for a month, which
   is here recorded, was praiseworthy or not? But it could not be
   otherwise than improper, inasmuch as it was a means of aggravating
   their grief; for men are naturally only too much inclined to excessive
   grief, even although they do not indulge it; and besides, the hope of a
   better life avails to mitigate sorrow. Hence we infer, that those are
   endued with scarcely any taste of eternal salvation, who give way to
   immoderate grief. But, since believers have another cause for mourning,
   i.e., to exercise themselves both in the fear of God, and in the hope
   and desire of the future resurrection, this solemn mourning has not
   been unreasonably received as a general custom. Since death is a mirror
   of God's curse upon the whole human race, it is profitable for us,
   whenever any of our belongings dies, to mourn our common lot, so as to
   humble ourselves beneath God's hand. Besides, if mourning is directed
   to its proper end, it in a manner unites the living with the dead; so
   that in death itself the communion of the new and immortal life shines
   forth. And further, the weakness of the ancient people had need of
   being propped and supported by such aids as this; for, amidst their
   dark shadows, it would not have been easy to rise above the world,
   unless they had been taught that the dead still belonged to them, and
   that there remained some bond of connection between them. But if the
   utility (of this custom) be corrupted by its abuse, it is not just that
   what is right in itself should be blamed for the fault of men.

   Numbers 33

   Numbers 33:38, 39

   38. And Aaron the priest went up into mount Hor, at the commandment of
   the Lord, and died there, in the fortieth year after the children of
   Israel were come out of the land of Egypt, in the first day of the
   fifth month.

   38. Ascendit autem Aharon sacerdos in Hor montem secundum sermonem
   Jehovae: et mortuus est ibi anno quadragesimo ex quo egressi sunt filii
   Israel e terra AEgypti, mense quinto, primo die mensis.

   39. And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old when he
   died in mount Hor.

   39. Erat Aharon natus centum ac viginti tres annos quando mortuus est
   in Hor monte.


   39. And Aaron was an hundred and twenty and three years old. It is not
   without reason that the great age of Aaron is expressly stated,
   inasmuch as his life had been prolonged to an unusual period, for the
   good of the people. At the age of an hundred he had already exceeded
   the ordinary extent of life; whereas, by God's extraordinary blessing,
   he survived until the people were about to pass into the promised land.
   Hence their ingratitude was the more base in not acknowledging this
   paternal care of God, since it was for their advantage that He
   preserved so long the minister of His grace.
     __________________________________________________________________

   Deuteronomy 10

   Deuteronomy 10:6,7

   6. And the children of Israel took their journey from Beeroth of the
   children of Jaakan to Mosera: there Aaron died, and there he was
   buried; and Eleazar his son ministered in the priest's office in his
   stead.

   6. Filii autem Israel profecti sunt de Beeroth filiorem Jaacan in
   Moserah: illic mortus est Aharon, et illic sepultus est, functusque est
   sacerdotio Eleazar filius ejus pro eo.

   7. From thence they journeyed unto Gudgodah; and from Gudgodah to
   Jotbath, a land of rivers of waters.

   7. Inde profecti sunt in Gudgodah, et de Gudgodah in Jobath terram
   torrentium aquarum.

   6. And the children of Israel. Since it is not the design of Moses to
   specify the stations here, as he does in Numbers 33, but only to mark
   the place in which Aaron died, I have therefore thought fit to connect
   what we read here with the preceding narrative. In the death of Aaron,
   they might recognize the punishment of their own rebellion. But that
   Eleazar should be substituted in his place, was a sign of the paternal
   grace of God, who did not suffer them to be deprived of this blessing.
   This succession, too, was to be a perpetual rule for the future, so
   that the sacerdotal dignity, according to God's prescription, should
   remain in that family.

   He here specifies the names of certain places, which he omits in the
   passage above cited; for he there states that the Israelites went
   straight from Kadesh-barnea to Mount Hor; and then makes them pass on
   to Zalmonah and Punon, perhaps because the places had different names,
   or because they did not pitch their camp in Gudgodah, or Jotbath;
   although the advantages of the spot might have invited them to stop in
   a well-watered valley, for it is called "the land of torrents," through
   which an abundance of water flowed.

   I do not advert to what every reader will readily observe for himself,
   that in the discourse of Moses the order of the history is inverted;
   for he says that the Levites were separated from the rest of the
   people, after the death of Aaron.

   Numbers 21

   Numbers 21:1-3

   1. And when king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south, heard
   tell that Israel came by the way of the spies, then he fought against
   Israel, and took some of them prisoners.

   1. Quum audisset Chananaeus rex Arad habitans in meridie quod veniret
   Israel per viam exploratorum, pugnavit cum Israele, et abduxit ab eo
   praedam (vel, captivitatem.)

   2. And Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord, and said, If thou wilt indeed
   deliver this people into my hand, then I will utterly destroy their
   cities.

   2. Vovit ergo Israel votum Jehovae, et dixit, Si tradendo tradideris
   populum istum in manum meam, delebo urbes eorum.

   3. And the Lord hearkened to the voice of Israel, and delivered up the
   Canaanites; and they utterly destroyed them and their cities: and he
   called the name of the place Hormah.

   3. Et exaudivit Jehova vocem Israelis, et dedit Chananaeum, et delevit
   eos ac urbes eorum: vocavitque nomen loci illius Horma.


   1. And when king Arad the Canaanite. It is not altogether agreed among
   commentators who this king Arad was. Some think that he was an
   Amalekite, but this error is refuted by the fact that the Amalekites
   had already attempted in vain to interrupt the journey of the people.
   Nor is it credible that after so great a slaughter, they would have
   endeavored to do so again, especially since their territories remained
   untouched. Besides, it would have been absurd to call the Amalekites
   Canaanites, since they derived their origin not from Canaan but from
   Esau, and thus were connected with the Israelites by a common descent
   from Shem. We shall, however, rightly understand this as referring to
   the Amorites, who were certainly reckoned among the Canaanites, as
   being of the same race; as Moses tells us in his first book, (Genesis
   10:16, and Genesis 15:21;) nay, he elsewhere designates all the people
   of Canaan by the name of Amorites. Moreover, in the thirty-fourth
   chapter of this book, we shall see that their boundaries reached to
   mount Hor and Kadesh-barnea. Since, then, the Amorites were in this
   neighborhood towards the south, the name will suit them very well. That
   king Arad, however, alone made war upon them, arose from the paternal
   providence of God, who wished to accustom His people to the conquest of
   their enemies by degrees. If all these nations had united their forces,
   and made a combined attack upon an unwarlike people, it would have
   succumbed in astonishment and fear. But it was easier for them to
   defend themselves against a single nation. And yet, in the first
   combat, God permitted the Israelites to be routed, so that the
   victorious Canaanite took some booty, or led away some captives. And
   this also was useful to the Israelites, in order that, mistrusting
   their own strength, they might humbly betake themselves to the succor
   of God; for it behooved them to learn that, unless they were aided from
   on high, they would be altogether insufficient, when they had to resist
   many powerful nations, since they had not been able to withstand even a
   single people.

   With respect to "the way of the spies," some understand that, as the
   people had been taught by Joshua and Caleb, they followed the footsteps
   of those who had been sent to explore the land; but, inasmuch as it
   appears that the course was a different one, I know not whether this
   opinion is very tenable. Thus, some take the word drk, derek, to mean
   "after the manner of," [116] which appears to be harsh and constrained.
   Thus, then, I explain it, Since they had to advance through unknown
   regions, spies were sent on, according to custom, to direct the whole
   march; and hence king Arad knew that his territory was to be invaded,
   before the army had proceeded so far.

   2. And Israel vowed a vow unto the Lord. This was a manifestation of
   piety, when they had sustained a loss, not to cast away hope, nor to
   murmur against God; but to encourage themselves by entreating His aid.
   To this slate of submissiveness they had been subdued by the
   chastisements of God, although the continuance of their obedience, as
   we shall presently see, was not of long duration. Any one at first
   sight would say that there was something absurd in this vow; but we
   gather from the result, that it was lawful and approved by God; for the
   sign of His approbation was that tie hearkened to the vows and cry of
   the people. I admit, indeed, that God sometimes answers defective
   prayers, but there is no doubt whatever but that Moses here commends
   their piety in the vow. We must consider, then, how it was lawful for
   them to offer the destruction of cities and the wasting of lands to God
   as a sacrifice of sweet savor; and the reply to this question will be
   easy, if we bear in mind that the vow did not originate in
   inconsiderate zeal, but rather in the command of God. It seems cruel to
   destroy an entire nation; but God had not only decreed its destruction,
   but had appointed the Israelites to execute His sentence. Hence the
   vow, of which we are now treating, was not idly spoken, being founded
   on God's word, which is the first rule for vowing rightly. It was,
   indeed, allowable for them to spare the cities, in order to possess
   them themselves; but it was also allowable to devote them as an
   offering (in anathema) of first-fruits to God, as we are elsewhere told
   of the city of Jericho. This at any rate we must conclude, that
   although God had not openly and expressly commanded the cities to be
   utterly destroyed, still this vow was dictated by the Holy Spirit, lest
   the people should yield to sloth, and set themselves down in a single
   corner, but that, having desolated and wasted this region, they might
   encourage themselves the more to further progress. The vero chrm
   charam, which Moses employs, signifies, indeed, to destroy, and from it
   is derived the word, chrmh chormah, or Hormah, which implies a species
   of anathema, as if they devoted the land to the curse of God. Moses,
   however, adds, that the people performed the vow, under the obligation
   of which they had laid themselves; and praiseworthy indeed was their
   magnanimity, in refusing to avail themselves of a comfortable home by
   destroying the cities, which they had acquired by the right of war.

   We know not whether the cities were destroyed immediately after the
   victory over their enemies; indeed, I rather conjecture that there was
   some interval of time, because the people did not straightway enter the
   boundaries of the promised land. And this more clearly appears from
   chapter 33, where, after this battle was fought, certain stations are
   enumerated, which are in another direction. It is probable, therefore,
   that they fought outside the boundaries of the Canaanites, and that,
   when the people came here soon afterwards, the land was finally put to
   the sword.

   Numbers 33:40

   40. And king Arad the Canaanite, which dwelt in the south in the land
   of Canaan, heard of the coming of the children of Israel.

   40. Audivit autem Chananaeus rex Arad (is vero habitabat in meridie in
   terra Chanaan) quum ingrederentur filii Israel.


   40. And king Arad the Canaanite. Although Moses gives no account of a
   battle, yet he briefly revives the recollection of the previous
   history; as much as to say, that in this part of their journey the
   Israelites at length met with their enemy, since they then began to
   fight with one of the nations of Canaan. In a word, the meaning is,
   that this was the beginning of their warfare, when the land which God
   had promised them as an inheritance was about to be occupied.

   Numbers 21

   Numbers 21:4-20

   4. And they journeyed from mount Hor by the way of the Red sea, to
   compass the land of Edom: and the soul of the people was much
   discouraged because of the way.

   4. Et profecti sunt de Hor monte per viam maris Suph, ut circuirent
   terram Edom: et angustiis affecta est anima populi in via.

   5. And the people spake against God, and against Moses, Wherefore have
   ye brought us up out of Egypt to die in the wilderness? for there is no
   bread, neither is there any water; and our soul loatheth this light
   bread.

   5. Itaque loquutus est populus contra Deum et Mosen, Ut quid ascendere
   nos fecistis ex Aegypto, ut moreremur in deserto? Non est enim panis
   neque aqua. Et taedet animam nostram super pane levi (aut, vili.)

   6. And the Lord sent fiery serpents among the people, and they bit the
   people; and much people of Israel died.

   6. Misit igitur Jehova in populum serpentes urentes, qui momorderunt
   populum: ita ut morcretur populus multus ex Israele.

   7. Therefore the people came to Moses, and said, We have sinned; for we
   have spoken against the Lord, and against thee: pray unto the Lord,
   that he take away the serpents from us. And Moses prayed for the
   people.

   7. Tunc venit populus ad Mosen, et dixerunt, Peccavimus, quia loquuti
   sumus contra Jehovam et contra te: ora Jehovam ut auferat a nobis
   serpentes istos. Et oravit Moses pro populo.

   8. And the Lord said unto Moses, Make thee a fiery serpent, and set it
   upon a pole: and it shall come to pass, that every one that is bitten,
   when he looketh upon it, shall live.

   8. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Fac tibi urentem, et pone eum super
   vexillum: et erit, quicunque morsus fuerit, et aspexerit ilium, tunc
   vivet.

   9. And Moses made a serpent of brass, and put it upon a pole; and it
   came to pass, that if a serpent had bitten any man, when he beheld the
   serpent of brass, he lived.

   9. Fecit ergo Moses serpentem aeneum, quem posuit supra vexillum: et
   fuit, quando momorderat serpens quenquam, aspiciebat ad serpentem
   aeneum, et vivebat.

   10. And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in Oboth.

   10. Et profecti sunt filii Israel, et castrametati sunt in Oboth.

   11. And they journeyed from Oboth, and pitched at Ije-abarim, in the
   wilderness which is before Moab, toward the sun rising.

   11. Profecti vero ex Oboth casstrametati sunt in Ije-abarim in deserto,
   quod erat in conspectu Moab ab ortu solis.

   12. From thence they removed, and pitched in the valley of Zared.

   12. Inde profecti castrametati sunt in valle Zered.

   13. From thence they removed, and pitched on the other side of Arnon,
   which is in the wilderness that cometh out of the coasts of the
   Amorites: for Arnon is the border of Moab, between Moab and the
   Amorites.

   13. Profecti deinde illinc castrametati sunt citra Arnon, qum est in
   deserto, et portenditur a termino Emorrhaei. Arnon enim est terminus
   Moab inter Moab et Emorrhaeum.

   14. Wherefore it is said in the book of the wars of the Lord, What he
   did in the Red sea, and in the brooks of Arnon.

   14. Ideirco dicetur in narratione praeliorum Jehovae, Vaheb in Suphah,
   et torrentes ad Arnon.

   15. And at the stream of the brooks that goeth down to the dwelling of
   Ar, and lieth upon the border of Moab,

   15. Et decursum torrentium, qui pergit ut quiescat in Ar, et recumbit
   in termino Moab.

   16. And from thence they went to Beer: that is the well whereof the
   Lord spake unto Moses, Gather the people together, and I will give them
   water.

   16. Illinc in Beer. Is est puteus de quo dixerat Jehova ad Mosen,
   Congrega populum, et dabo illis aquam.

   17. Then Israel sang this song, Spring up, O well; sing ye unto it:

   17. Tunc cecinit Israel carmen hoc, Ascende Beer, canite ei.

   18. The princes digged the well, the nobles of the people digged it, by
   the direction of the lawgiver, with their staves. And from the
   wilderness they went to Mattanah;

   18. Puteus quem loderunt principes, loderunt eum principes populi cum
   legislatore baculis suis. Et e deserto in Mathanah.

   19. And from Mattanah to Nahaliel; and from Nahaliel to Bamoth;

   19. Et e Mathanah in Nahaliel: et de Nahaliel in Bamoth.

   20. And from Bamoth in the valley, that is in the country of Moab, to
   the top of Pisgah, which looketh toward Jeshimon.

   20. Et de Bamoth Hagaie, quae est in regione Moab, in vertice coilis,
   et respicit contra faciem deserti, (vel, Gessimon.)


   4. And they journeyed from mount Hor. This also is narrated in their
   praise, that they bore the weariness of a long and circuitous march,
   when they were already worn down by their wanderings for forty years.
   Moses, therefore, tells us that, since God had forbidden them to pass
   the borders of Edom, they went by another way; but immediately
   afterwards he adds, that they basely rebelled, without being provoked
   to do so by any new cause. They had before been rebellious under the
   pressure of hunger or thirst, or some other inconvenience; but now,
   when there were no grounds for doing so, they malignantly exasperate
   themselves against God. Some understand that they were afflicted in
   mind because of the way, [117] so that the v, beth, indicates the cause
   of their grief and trouble. It might, indeed, be the case that their
   passage through the mountains was steep and difficult; but a pleasant
   region was almost in sight, gently to attract them onward. Again, they
   falsely complain of want of water, in which respect God had already
   applied a remedy. Nothing, then, could be more unfair than odiously to
   recall to memory a past evil, in which they had experienced the special
   aid of God. But their depravity is more thoroughly laid open in their
   loathing of the manna, as a food affording but little nutriment, or
   contemptible.

   The verb [118] qtsr, katzar, is used first, which signifies to
   constrain; thus some explain it, that they were rendered anxious by
   distress. But since the same word is used for to shorten, others
   translate it that their minds were broken down with weariness, so as to
   faint by the way. In any case, a voluntary bitterness is indicated,
   whereby they were possessed, so that their alacrity in advancing
   altogether failed them. The verb [119] , qtsh, katzah, which Jerome
   renders sickens, is not used simply for disgust, but signifies that
   weariness which excruciates or agonizes the mind.

   They call the manna "light" food; as much as to say that it inflates
   rather than satisfies or nourishes; or, as I deem more probable, the
   word qlql, kelokel, is used metaphorically for vile, or contemptible,
   and valueless.

   5. And the people spake against God and against Moses. Either because
   they murmured against God in the person of Moses, or else because their
   impiety broke forth to such a furious extent, that they openly
   blasphemed against God; and this latter opinion is most in accordance
   with the words, because by their use of the plural number they accuse
   two parties together. [120] But, inasmuch as Moses had nothing separate
   from God, no one could enter into a contest with him without warring
   also against God Himself. Here, however, as I have said, their
   insolence proceeded still further, so as not only to rail against the
   minister, but to vomit forth also their wicked blasphemy against God
   Himself, as if He had injured them most grossly by their deliverance.

   6. And the Lord sent fiery serpents. Their ingratitude was justly and
   profitably chastised by this punishment; for they were practically
   taught that it was only through God's paternal care that they had been
   previously free from innumerable evils, and that He was possessed of
   manifold forms of punishment, whereby to take vengeance on the wicked.

   Although deserts are full of many poisonous animals, still it is
   probable that these serpents suddenly arose, and were created for this
   special purpose; as if God, in His determination to correct the
   people's pride, should call into being new enemies to trouble them. For
   they were made to feel how great their folly was to rebel against God,
   when they were not able to cope with the serpents. This, then, was an
   admirable plan for humbling them, contemptuously to bring these
   serpents into the field against them, and thus to convince them of
   their weakness. Consequently, they both confess their guilt and
   acknowledge that there was no other remedy for them except to obtain
   pardon from God. These two things, as we are aware, are necessary in
   order to appease God, first, that the sinner should be dissatisfied
   with himself and self-condemned; and, secondly, that he should seek to
   be reconciled to God. The people seem faithfully to fulfill both of
   these conditions, when they of their own accord acknowledge their
   guilt, and humbly have recourse to God's mercy. It is through the
   influence of terror that they implore the prayers of Moses, since they
   count themselves unworthy of favor, unless an advocate (patronus)
   should intercede for them. This would, indeed, be erroneous, that those
   who are conscience-struck should invite an intercessor to stand between
   them and God, unless they, too, should unite their own prayers with
   his; for nothing is more contrary to faith than such a state of alarm
   as prevents us from calling upon God. Still the kindness of Moses, and
   his accustomed gentleness is perceived by this, that he is so readily
   disposed to listen to these wicked ones; and God also, on His part,
   shews that the prayer of a righteous man is not unavailing, when He
   heals the wound He had inflicted. [121]

   8. Make thee a fiery serpent. Nothing would, at first sight, appear
   more unreasonable than that a brazen serpent should be made, the sight
   of which should extirpate the deadly poison; but this apparent
   absurdity was far better suited to render the grace of God conspicuous
   than as if there had been anything natural in the remedy. If the
   serpents had been immediately removed, they would have deemed it to be
   an accidental occurrence, and that the evil had vanished by natural
   means. If, in the aid afforded, anything had been applied, bearing an
   affinity to fit and appropriate remedies, then also the power and
   goodness of God would have been thrown into the shade. In order,
   therefore, that they might perceive themselves to be rescued from death
   by the mere grace of God alone, a mode of preservation was chosen so
   discordant with human reason, as to be almost a subject for laughter.
   At the same time it had the effect of trying the obedience of the
   people, to prescribe a mode of seeking preservation, whichbrought all
   their senses into subjection and captivity. It was a foolish thing to
   turn the eyes to a serpent of brass, to prevent the ill effects of a
   poisonous bite; for what, according to man's judgment, could a lifeless
   statue, lifted up on high, profit? But it is the peculiar virtue of
   faith, that we should willingly be fools, in order that we may learn to
   be wise only from the mouth of God. This afterwards more clearly
   appeared in the substance of this type: for, when Christ compares
   Himself to this serpent which Moses lifted up in the wilderness, (John
   3:14,) it was not a mere common similitude which He employs, but He
   teaches us, that what had been shewn forth in this dark shadow, was
   completed in Himself. And, surely, unless the brazen serpent had been a
   symbol of spiritual grace, it would not have been laid up like a
   precious treasure, and diligently preserved for many ages in God's
   sanctuary. The analogy, also, is very perfect; since Christ, in order
   to rescue us from death, put on our flesh, not, indeed, subject to sin,
   but representing "the likeness of sinful flesh," as Paul says. (Romans
   8:3.) hence follows, what I have above adverted to, that since "the
   world by wisdom knew not God," He was manifested in the foolishness of
   the cross. (1 Corinthians 1:21.) If, then, we desire to obtain
   salvation, let us not be ashamed to seek it from the curse of Christ,
   which was typified in the image of the serpent.

   Its lifting up is poorly and incorrectly, in my opinion, explained by
   some, as foreshadowing the crucifixion, [122] whereas it ought rather
   to be referred to the preaching of the Gospel: for Moses was commanded
   to set up the serpent on high, that it might be conspicuous on every
   side. And the word ns nes, is used both for a standard, and the mast of
   a ship, or any other high pole: which is in accordance with the
   prophecy of Isaiah, where he says that Christ should be "for an ensign"
   to all nations, (Isaiah 11:10) which we know to have been the case, by
   the spreading of the doctrine of the Gospel through the whole world,
   with which the look of faith corresponds. For, just as no healing was
   conveyed from the serpent to any who did not turn their eyes towards
   it, when set up on high, so the look of faith only causes the death of
   Christ to bring salvation to us. Although, therefore, God would give
   relief to their actual distress, it is still unquestionable that He
   even then admonished all believers that the venomous bites of the devil
   could only be cured by their directing their minds and senses by faith
   on Christ.

   The brazen serpent is, furthermore, a proof to us how inclined to
   superstition the human race is, since posterity worshipped it as an
   idol, until it was reduced to powder by the holy king Hezekiah. (1
   Kings 18:4.)

   10. And the children of Israel set forth. Moses does not here enumerate
   all the stations, which will be mentioned hereafter, when he
   recapitulates them all separately and in order: for, in hastening to
   record certain memorable circumstances, he passes over those of minor
   importance, which, however, he does not omit elsewhere; since the
   account of their circuitous course, when they were turning away from
   the Edomites, was of some moment. For it was, as we have observed, no
   ordinary proof of obedience, when God had forbidden them to attack the
   Edomites, that they should undertake a difficult and rugged march.
   Still in this place Moses deemed it sufficient to mark the principal
   places in which they stopped. Meanwhile, what I have stated appears to
   be the case, that he hastens onwards to relate circumstances of much
   importance, for, when they came to Arnon, he highly magnifies the power
   of God, with which He succoured His people.

   13. From thence they removed, and pitched. I will presently add, what
   Moses relates in Deuteronomy respecting the Moabites and Ammonites.
   Since here he only briefly touches upon the main facts, he only
   specifies that the people came to the borders of their enemies, where
   it was necessary to give battle, because there was no means of entering
   the land of Canaan, except by force of arms. Here, then, was the end of
   their journeying, for, when the Amorites were conquered, they began to
   inhabit their cities. He, therefore, immediately adds, that this place
   would be memorable in all ages, because in it God again exerted His
   power, by putting to flight their enemies. Still translators appear to
   me to be mistaken as to the meaning of the words. Almost all of them
   render the word sphr, sepher, "the book;" and afterwards eagerly
   discuss what book it is, without coming to any satisfactory conclusion.
   I rather understand it to mean "narration;" as if Moses had said, that
   when the wars of Jehovah shall be recounted, the memory of this place
   would be celebrated; as David, when he is recounting, and magnifying
   God's mercies, expressly mentions that king Sihon and Og were
   conquered.

   There is also another ambiguity in the following words: for some
   suppose Vaheb to be the proper name of a city, and Suphah a noun
   common, which they translate "in a whirlwind;" [123] but, since the
   shore of the Red Sea was not habitable, I do not see how mention could
   be suitably made of any city situated there. But if they think it was a
   city near Arnon, it is surprising that it should never be spoken of
   elsewhere, and yet here referred to, as if it were well known. I
   therefore rather incline to their opinion, who explain it as a vero,
   and suppose that v (vau) is used for y (yod,) so that the sense should
   be; As God had begun to fight gloriously for the Israelites at the Red
   Sea, so also He continued the same grace at Arnon. I admit, that if the
   points be scrupulously insisted upon, this meaning would not be
   altogether accordant with grammar; but I prefer eliciting a probable
   meaning at the cost of a single point, than to go out of the way in
   search of poor conjectures, as they do who imagine Vaheb to be the
   proper name of a place. Appropriately, indeed, does Moses compare Arnon
   with the Red Sea, in order to shew that God's grace, at its end, is
   thoroughly in accordance with its commencement. He had mightily fought
   against the Egyptians, and had destroyed the army of Pharaoh in the Red
   Sea, but small would have been the fruit of this deliverance, unless,
   with equal efficacy, He had succoured His people when they had to
   contend with the Canaanitish nations: for the question here is not as
   to God's blessings in general, but only as to the victories, wherein it
   was manifested that the Israelites did not fight without the approval
   and guidance of God. Moses, therefore, does not recount the miracles
   performed in the desert: but only says, that in the history of the wars
   of God the name of Arnon would be equally renowned with that of the Red
   Sea. Still, in the word Arnon it must be observed that there is a
   synecdoche; forMoses comprehends in it all the subsequent battles.
   Since, therefore, from the time that the people arrived at Arnon, where
   their enemies came forth to meet them, God again lifted up His
   standard, and gloriously honored His people by continued victories --
   hence the special celebrity of the place arose. There is a poetical
   repetition in the verse, where, for the torrents, the stream of the
   torrents [124] is spoken of, which descends to Ar, and reposes in the
   border of Moab.

   16. And from thence they went to Beer. Some think that a circumstance
   is here narrated, which had never been mentioned before, since a song
   is recorded, which we do not find elsewhere. But since Moses repeats
   the same words which he had used before, and speaks as of a very
   notorious matter, that he was there commanded to assemble the people,
   to partake of the water which God had given, it appears probable to me
   that the name was given to the place, whereby both God's goodness and
   the people's ingratitude might be testified to posterity. I do not,
   however, contend that this is the same place, from whence we previously
   read that water was extracted: for it was not there only that the
   people was satisfied by drinking it, but it flowed forth beside them
   wherever they went. In which sense Paul writes that "the Rock followed
   them," (1 Corinthians 10:4;) not that the rock was torn from its roots,
   but because God miraculously drew on the water which flowed from it, so
   that it should accompany them, and thus continually supply them with
   drink. And this we gather also from the next verse, where Moses says,
   that the people "sang this song, Ascend, Beer." [125] For when they saw
   that, contrary to nature, the water rose into higher levels from the
   source which was recently called into existence, so as to supply them
   with drink in dry places, they began to pay more attention to the
   miracle, and to celebrate the grace of God. Still it might be the case
   that the water did not flow down like a river, but bubbled up from the
   open veins of the earth, whenever it was required. At any rate, by its
   ascent he indicates an extraordinary effect produced by God. When it is
   said, that "the princes digged the well," there is, in my opinion, an
   implied contrast between a few persons, and those but little fitted for
   manual labors, and a great body of engineers. Whenever armies have need
   of water, the soldiers dig wells with much labor; here quite another
   mode of proceeding is expressed, viz., that the leaders of the people,
   together with Moses, dug the well, not by artificial or mechanical
   means, but by the simple touch of a staff. Moses, indeed, speaks of
   "staves," in the plural nmnber, because mention of the princes is made;
   but I have no doubt but that the rod of Moses is contrasted with all
   other implements, in order to exalt the power and grace of God. I
   think, too, that the name of Beer was given to the place, where that
   water forsook the Israelites; since they had come to well-watered
   regions, which would supply water in abundance without miraculous
   interference. Let us, however, learn from this canticle, that, although
   the people had at first impiously rebelled against God, still, by long
   experience of the blessing, they were at length induced to gratitude,
   so as to burst forth into praise of God. Hence we gather, that they
   were not obstinate in their senselessness.

   Deuteronomy 2

   Deuteronomy 2:9-23

   9. And the Lord said unto me, Distress not the Moabites, neither
   contend with them in battle: for I will not give thee of their land for
   a possession; because I have given Ar unto the children of Lot for a
   possession.

   9. Et dixit mihi Jehova, Ne oppugnes Moab, neque lacessas eum bello,
   quia non dabo tibi e terra ejus possessionem; filiis enim Lot dedi Ar
   in haereditatem.

   10. The Emims dwelt therein in times past, a people great, and many,
   and tall, as the Anakims;

   10. Emim antea habitabant in ea, populus magnus et multus, et excelsus,
   sicut Anacim.

   11. Which also were accounted giants, as the Anakims; but the Moabites
   call them Emims.

   11. Gigantes reputabantur etiam ipsi sicut Anacim; et Moabitae vocarunt
   eos Emim.

   12. The Horims also dwelt in Seir beforetime; but the children of Esau
   succeeded them, when they had destroyed them from before them, and
   dwelt in their stead, as Israel did unto the land of his possession,
   which the Lord gave unto them.

   12. In Seir autem habitaverunt Horim antea, quos filii Esau expulerunt,
   et perdiderunt a facie sua, habitaveruntque loco ipsorum, quemadmodum
   Israel in terrapossessionis sum quam dedit illis Jehova.

   13. Now rise up, said I, and get you over the brook Zered: and we went
   over the brook Zered.

   13. Nunc surgite et transite torrentem Zered: et transivimus torrentem
   Zered.

   14. And the space in which we cane from Kadesh-barnea, until we were
   come over the brook Zered, was thirty and eight years; until all the
   generation of the men of war were wasted out from among the host, as
   the Lord sware unto them.

   14. Dies autem quibus ambulavimus de Cades-barnea, donec transiremus
   tortentem Zered, fuerunt triginta-octo anni, donec consumeretur tota
   generario virorum bellatorum de medio castrorum, quemadmodum juraverat
   Jehova illis.

   15. For indeed the hand of the Lord was against them, to destroy them
   from among the host, until they were consumed.

   15. Praeterea manus Jehovae fuit in eos, ut perderet eos e medio
   castrorum, donec consumeret eos.

   16. So it came to pass, when all the men of war were consumed and dead
   from among the people,

   16. Et fuit, postquam consumpti fuerunt omnes viri bellatores, ut
   morerentur e medio populi.

   17. That the Lord spake unto me, saying,

   17. Tunc loquutus est Jehova ad me, dicendo:

   18. Thou art to pass over through Ar, the coast of Moab, this day:

   18. Tu transiturus es hodie terminumMoab, nempe Ar.

   19. And when thou comest nigh over against the children of Ammon,
   distress them not, nor meddle with them: for I will not give thee of
   the land of the children of Ammon any possession, because I have given
   it unto the children of Lot for a possession.

   19. Et accedes ad viciniam filiorum Ammon, ne obsideas eos, neque
   in'ites eos, quia non daturus sum tibi de terra filiorum Ammon
   possessionem aliquam: nam filiis Lot dedi illam in possessionem.

   20. (That also was accounted a land of giants: giants dwelt therein in
   old time; and the Ammonites call them Zamzummims;

   20. Terra gigantum reputata fuit etiam ipsa: gigantes habitaverunt in
   ea olim, quos Ammonitae vocabant Zamzumim.

   21. A people great, and many, and tall, as the Anakims; but the Lord
   destroyed them before them, and they succeeded them, and dwelt in their
   stead:

   21. Populus magnus et multus et excelsus sicut Anacim: et perdidit eos
   Jehova a facie eorum, possede-runtque eos, et habitaverunt loco
   ipsorum.

   22. As he did to the children of Esau which dwelt in Seir, when he
   destroyed the Horims from before them; and they succeeded them, and
   dwelt in their stead, even unto this day:

   22. Quemadmodum fecit filiis Esau, habitantibus in Seir, propter quos
   disperdidit Horaeos a facie corum, et possederunt eos, habitave runtque
   loco ipsormn usque in hanc diem.

   23. And the Avims which dwelt in Hazerim, even unto Azzah, the
   Caphtorims, which came forth out of Caphtor, destroyed them, and dwelt
   in their stead.)

   23. Et Avaeos qui habitabant in Haserim usque Azzah, Caphthorim qui
   egressi sunt de Caphthor, per diderunt eos, et habitaverunt loco
   ipsorum.


   9. And the Lord said unto me, Distress not the Moabites. He had
   previously forbidden them to enter the land of Edom, unless consent
   were obtained. A similar prohibition is now added with respect to the
   Moabites, because God had allotted to them the territory which they
   inhabited. As I have said, this was painful and burdensome, that they
   should cherish kindness and fraternal good-will towards those who
   treated them with hostility; but God desired in this respect also to
   prove the obedience of His people. He did not, then, take into
   consideration what this nation had dcserved; but, inasmuch as they were
   the descendants of Lot, and consequently of the race of Abraham, He
   desired to treat them with special favor. For the division of the whole
   world appertains to Him, so as to distribute to its various peoples
   whatever part He chooses, and to fix the bounds wherein they should
   confine themselves. If any object that the people of Canaan had also
   their limits assigned to them, and ought not, therefore, to have been
   expelled from the lands in which their forefathers had for many ages
   inhabited, the reply is easy, viz., that God is always free to take
   away what He has given, and to readjust the boundaries imposed by His
   will, when the sins of men deserve that this should be done. When,
   therefore, He declares that He had given their land to the Moabites, it
   is not according to the ordinary force of the expression, but by a
   fixed decree that their habitation should remain sure and undisturbed.

   10. The Emims dwelt therein in times past. This is a confirmation of
   the foregoing declaration, which is, however, inserted by way of
   parenthesis by Moses himself; for the ninth verse, which I have just
   expounded, is followed regularly by the thirteenth, "Now rise up," etc.
   For, after God had turned away the people from the borders of Moab, He
   shews them in what direction they must pass over; but Moses,
   interrupting the address of God, explains how the Moabites had obtained
   that territow, though they were strangers, and had no land of their own
   on which they might set their foot;. For Lot was no less an alien than
   Abraham; Moses, therefore, states how by special privilege the
   posterity of Lot became masters of that land which giants had
   previously possessed. For it was not by human means that, having driven
   out the giants, who were formidable to all men, they had obtained the
   peaceful occupation, and even the dominion of that land, which might
   have seemed to be invincible, from the valor and strength of its
   inhabitants. He says, therefore, that the giants dwelt there, as also
   in Mount Seir; and that both were overcome and destroyed, not so much
   by the hand and arms of men as by the power of God, so that their land
   might be cleared for possession as well for the children of Esau as for
   those of Lot. Now, since God elsewhere declares that He had given Mount
   Seir to Esau as an inheritance, according as He had promised to his
   father Isaac, it follows that the Moabites had obtained their land also
   by the same Divine authority. The comparison which is made between Edom
   and the Israelites does not hold good in all respects; for, although
   Esau was sustained by this consolation, that his inheritance should be
   of "the fatness of the earth," (Genesis 27:39,) it might still be the
   case that with regard to himself and his posterity, their possession
   should not be legitimate; whereas God so promised the land of Canaan to
   the race of Abraham, that the Israelites received the dominion over it,
   as if from His own hand, as it is said in Psalm 136:21. In this
   respect, too, there was a difference, because the land of Canaan was
   chosen as that in which God should gather His Church, in which He
   should be purely worshipped, and which should be an earnest, to the
   faithful of the heavenly and eternal rest. But, as elsewhere, the
   distinction between the sons of Esau and Jacob is marked, so now Moses
   [126] magnifies God's special blessing towards them both.

   13. Now rise up. He now proceeds with what he had begun in verse 9,
   viz, that God had commanded them to pass by the land of Seir, and to
   advance to the brook Zered; as much as to say, that after they had been
   subdued by their misfortunes, they were prohibited from further
   progress, until God should open the way before them, and thus they
   should follow Him as their leader, and not make a passage for
   themselves at their own discretion.

   He afterwards specifies the period of delay which they had been
   compelled by God to pass in the desert, after they had once reached the
   borders of the promised land. He says, then, that after thirty-eight
   years they had at length returned to the land from whence they had been
   obliged to retire; and briefly reminds them how long the course of
   their deliverance had been interrupted through their own fault, since
   they had gone forth to enjoy the promised land. He calls those "warlike
   men," or, in the Hebrew, "men of war," whose age entitled them to bear
   arms, i.e., who had exceeded their twentieth year.

   When mention is elsewhere made of forty years, the two years are then
   included which were spent both in Mount Sinai and in other places; and
   with good reason, because, during that time also, their sins prevented
   them from passing to the enjoyment of their inheritance immediately
   after the promulgation of the law.

   19. And when thou comest nigh over against the children ofAmmon. God
   now makes provision as to the Ammonites, since their condition was the
   same as that of the Moabites, inasmuch as they were descended from the
   two daughters of Lot. It might, indeed, seem wonderful that, since the
   memory of their origin was detestable, these two nations should have
   been so dear to God. Ammon and Moab had been born of an incestuous
   connection. It was, therefore, more reasonable that this tragical
   circumstance should have been buried by their destruction, than that
   they should have been distinguished by God's favor from the common lot
   of other nations, as if their nobility rendered them superior to
   others. But let us learn from hence, that since God's judgments, like a
   deep abyss, are beyond our apprehension, they should be regarded with
   reverence. Lot's distinguished piety is expressly declared. The
   disgraceful crime, which he committed when drunk, it pleased God so to
   mark with perpetual infamy, as still to impress upon it some signs of
   His mercy, although this was done especially for the sake of Abraham
   himself. It is unquestionable, however, that God recommends the
   posterity of Lot to the Israelites on this ground, that they may more
   willingly exercise kindness towards them, and abstain from all injury,
   when they had to do with two nations whom they see to be cared for by
   God Himself, for the sake of their common relationship to Abraham.

   Furthermore, by the same argument whereby he had before proved that
   both Edomites and Moabites, relying on God's help, had occupied the
   lands over which they had dominion, he now establishes that the land
   which the Ammonites possessed had been granted them by God, viz.,
   because in their conquest and overthrow of the giants they had
   surpassed the limits of human bravery, and thus God had given a proof
   of His special and unusual favor towards them. For neither by the
   ordinary course of nature could two men increase to so great a
   multitude.

   Now, although the Hebrew call the Cappadocians Caphthorim, [127] we do
   not know whether the giants, whose country was taken possession of by
   the Ammonites, sprung from them. But, if this be admitted, they had a
   long journey, attended by many dangers, after they left their country;
   and again, since they must have passed through rich and fertile
   regions, it is strange that they should have penetrated to those
   mountains. It might, however, be the case, that, making forays as
   robbers, they nowhere found a quiet resting-place until a less
   cultivated region presented itself.

   Numbers 21

   Numbers 21:21-32

   21. And Israel sent messengers unto Sihon king of the Amorites, saying,

   21. Misit Israel legatos ad Sihon regem AEmorrhaeorum, dicendo:

   22. Let me pass through thy land: we will not turn into the fields, or
   into the vineyards; we will not drink of the waters of the well; but we
   will go along by the king's high-way, until we be past thy borders.

   22. Transeam per terram tuam: non declinabimus per agros, neque per
   vineam: non bibemus aquas puteorum, via regia pergemus, donec
   transierimus terminum tuum.

   23. And Sihon would not suffer Israel to pass through his border; but
   Sihon gathered all his people together, and went out against Israel
   into the wilderness: and he came to Jahaz, and fought against Israel.

   23. At non permisit Sihon Israeli ut transiret per terminum suum.
   Itaque congregavit Sihon universum populum suum, et egressus est obviam
   Israeli in desertum, venitque in Jahaz et pugnavit cum Israele.

   24. And Israel smote him with the edge of the sword, and possessed his
   land from Arnon unto Jabbok, even unto the children of Ammon: for the
   border of the children of Ammon was strong.

   24. Et percussit eum Israel in ore gladii, et hareditate accepit terram
   ejus ab Arnon usque ad Jabbok usque ad filios Ammon: quia munitus erat
   terminus filiorum Ammon.

   25. And Israel took all these cities: and Israel dwelt in all the
   cities of the Amorites, in Heshbon, and in all the villages thereof.

   25. Et accepit Israel omnes istas urbes, et habitavit Israel in omnibus
   urbibus AEmorrhaei, in Hesbon, et in omnibus oppidis ejus.

   26. For Heshbon was the city of Sihon the king of the Amorites, who had
   fought against the former king of Moab, and taken all his land out of
   his hand, even unto Arnon.

   26. Hesbon erat urbs Sihon regis AEmorrhaei. Nam ipse pugnaverat contra
   regem Moab primum, et acceperat omnem terram ejus a manu usque ad
   Arnon.

   27. Wherefore they that speak in proverbs say, Come into Heshbon, let
   the city of Sihon be built and prepared;

   27. Idcirco dicunt parabolice loquentes, Venite in Hesbon, aedificetur
   et instauretur urbs ipsi Sihon:

   28. For there is a fire gone out of Heshbon, a flame from the city of
   Sihon: it hath consumed Ar of Moab, and the lords of the high places of
   Arnon.

   28. Quia ignis egressus est de Hesbon, et flamma ex urbe Sihon
   consumpsit Ar Moab et dominos excelsorum Arnon.

   29. Woe to thee, Moab! thou art undone, O people of Chemosh! he hath
   given his sons that escaped, and his daughters, into captivity, unto
   Sihon king of the Amorites.

   29. Vae tibi Moab, periisti popule Chemos, dedit filios suos in fugam,
   et filias suas in captivitatem regis AEmorrhaei Sihon.

   30. We have shot at them: Heshbon is perished even unto Dibon, and we
   have laid them waste even unto Nophah, which reacheth unto Medeba.

   30. Et lucerna eorum periit ab Hesbon usque ad Dibon, et delevimus
   usque ad Nopah, quae est ad medebah.

   31. Thus Israel dwelt in the land of the Amorites.

   31. Habitavit itaque Israel in terra AEmorrhaei.

   32. And Moses sent to spy out Jaazer, and they took the villages
   thereof, and drove out the Amorites that were there.

   32. Misit deinde Moses ad explorandum Jaazer, et ceperunt oppida ejus,
   et expulit AEmorrhaeum qui erat ibi.


   A Repitition of the same History

   Deuteronomy 2

   Deuteronomy 2:24-37

   24. Rise ye up, take your journey, and pass over the river Arnon:
   behold, I have given into thine hand Sihon the Amorite, king of
   Heshbon, and his land; begin to possess it, and contend with him in
   battle.

   24. Surgite, proficiscimini, et transite torrentem Arnon. Vide, dedi in
   manum tuam Sihon regem Hesbon, Aemorrhaeumn et terram ejus, incipe
   possidere, et dimica praelio cun eo.

   25. This day will I begin to put the dread of thee, and the fear of
   thee, upon the nations that are under the whole heaven, who shall hear
   report of thee, and shall tremble, and be in anguish because of thee

   25. Hotde incipiam dare pavorem tui et formidinem tui super faciem
   populorum qui sunt sub toto coelo, qui audierant famam tuam, et
   pavebunt, timebuntque a facie tua.

   26. And I sent messengers out of the wilderness of Kedemoth unto Sihon
   king of Heshbon, with words of peace, saying,

   26. Et misi nuntios e deserto Cedemoth ad Sihon regem Hesbon verbis
   pacificis, dicendo:

   27. Let me pass through thy land: I will go along by the high-way, I
   will neither turn unto the right hand nor to the left.

   27. Transeam per terram tuam, per viam ambulabo, non declinabo ad
   dexteram nec ad sinistram.

   28. Thou shalt sell me meat for money, that I may eat; and give me
   water for money, that I may drink: only I will pass through on my feet,

   28. Cibum argento vendes mihi ut comedam: aquam argento dabis mihi ut
   bibam, tantum transibo pedibus meis:

   29. (As the children of Esau which dwell in Seir, and the Moabites
   which dwell in Ar, did unto me.) until I shall pass over Jordan, into
   the land which the Lord our God giveth us.

   29. Quemadmodum fecerunt mihi filii Esau qui habitant in Seir, et
   Moabitae qui habitant in Ar: donec transiero Jordanem ad terram quam
   Jehova Deus noster dat nobis.

   30. But Sihon king of Heshbon would not let us pass by him: for the
   Lord thy God hardened his spirit, and made his heart obstinate, that he
   might deliver him into thy hand, as appeareth this day.

   30. Et noluit Sihon rex Hesbon ut transiremus per sua. Induraverat enim
   Jehova Deus tuus spiritum ejus: et obfirmaverat cor ejus, ut daret eum
   in manu tun, ut hodie est.

   31. And the Lord said unto me, Behold, I have begun to give Sihon and
   his land before thee: begin to possess, that thou mayest inherit his
   land.

   31. Dixit autem Jehova ad me, Vide, jam coepi dare coram te Sihon, et
   terram ejus, incipe possidere, ut possideas terram ejus.

   32. Then Sihon came out against us, he and all his people, to fight at
   Jahaz.

   32. Egressus est autem Sihon in occursum nostrum ipse et universus
   popuhs ejus ad praelium in Jahaz.

   33. And the Lord our God delivered him before us; and we smote him, and
   his sons, and all his people.

   33. Et tradidit ilium Jehova Deus noster coram nobis, percussimusque
   eum et filios ejus, et totum populum ejus.

   34. And we took all his cities at that time, and utterly destroyed the
   men, and the women, and the little ones, of every city; we left none to
   remain:

   34. Cepimus quoque omnes urbes ejus eo tempore, et destruximus omnes
   urbes, viros et mulieres, et parvulos: non reliquimus superstitem.

   35. Only the cattle we took for a prey unto ourselves, and the spoil of
   the cities which we took.

   35. Veruntamen jumenta praedati sumus nobis, et spolia; urbium quas
   cepimus.

   36. From Aroer, which is by the brink of the river of Arnon, and from
   the city that is by the river, even unto Gilead, there was not one city
   too strong for us: the Lord our God delivered all unto us.

   36. Ab Aroer qaee est juxta ripam torrentis Arnon, et urbe quae est in
   valle, usque ad Gillad, non fuit urbs quae effugerit a nobis, omnes
   tradidit Jehova Deus noster coram nobis.

   37. Only unto the land of the children of Ammon thou camest not, nor
   unto any place of the river Jabbok, nor unto the cities in the
   mountains, nor unto whatsoever the Lord our God forbade us.

   37. Tantummodo ad terram filiorum Ammon non accessisti, omnem locum
   torrentis Jabboc, et urbes montanas, atque omnia de quibus praecepit
   Jehova Deus noster.


   Numbers 21:21. And Israel sent messengers. The second narration, which
   I have subjoined from Deuteronomy, is the fuller; nevertheless, a
   question arises from it, for what reason this embassy was sent to king
   Sihon, whose kingdom was already devoted to the Israelites: for it
   seems to be altogether inconsistent to offer conditions of peace when
   war is decreed. God commands His people to take up arms: He declares
   that they shall be victorious, so as to occupy the land of Sihon by
   right of war; what, then, can be more absurd than to request of him
   that they might pass through his land in peace? If this attempt were
   made by Moses without the command of God, such an excess of kindness
   was not devoid of guilt, inasmuch as it was an act of much temerity to
   promise what God had appointed otherwise. But, if we should say that
   the messengers went with the authority, and at the command of God,
   under what pretext shall the deceptiveness of the act be excused? for
   it is very improper to flatter with soothing words and promises those
   whom you have destined to destruction. The conclusion I come to is,
   that although the event was not unknown to God, still the embassy was
   sent, nevertheless, by his command and decree, in order to lay open the
   obstinate ferocity of the nation. But, since the secret judgments of
   God far surmount our senses, let us learn to reverence their height;
   and let this sober view restrain our boldness like a rein, viz., that
   although the reason for the works of God be unknown to us, still it
   always exists with Him. God knew that the messengers would speak to the
   deaf, and yet it is not in vain that He bids them go; for, since the
   kingdom of Sihon was not properly included in the promised land, it was
   not lawful for the children of Israel to make war upon it until they
   had been provoked by an unjust refusal. Thus, then, I connect the
   history. Before they had been assured at God's command of the event,
   and the victory, they sent the messengers, who demanded that a pacific
   passage should be accorded to them; and that then the permission to
   have recourse to arms was granted. If any prefer to think that, before
   Moses attempted to preserve peace, he had been made acquainted with all
   that would occur, I will not contend the point; but I deem it more
   probable that he had expectations of the peace which he sought, because
   the judgment of God had not yet been declared. If, therefore, Sihon had
   allowed himself to be propitiated, Moses would never have dared to deal
   with him as an enemy; but, he rather simply and honestly promised
   peace, which he intended to preserve; God, however, had otherwise
   appointed, as the event presently shewed. Still He was not inconsistent
   with Himself, or variable, in sending the messengers to an
   irreclaimable and obstinately perverse man; for thus was all excuse
   taken away when he had voluntarily provoked to war a people who were
   ready and willing to maintain peace and equity. But rather may we see
   in this history, as in a glass, that, whilst God earnestly invites the
   reprobate to repentance and the hope of salvation, He has no other
   object than that they may be rendered inexcusable by the detection of
   their impiety. Hence is their ignorance refuted, who gather from this
   that it is free for all promiscuously to embrace God's grace, because
   its promulgation (doctrina) is common, and directed to all without
   exception; as if God was not aware of what Sihon would answer when He
   would have him attracted to equity by friendly and peaceful words; or
   as if, on his free will, the purpose of God was suspended as to the
   war, which was soon after carried forward by His decree.

   But inasmuch as what is here briefly recorded, would be obscure in
   itself, we must explain it by the other narrative, where it is thus
   written, --

   Deuteronomy 2:24. Rise ye up, take your journey. I have lately said
   that the order is here inverted, for what soon after follows, "And I
   sent messengers out of the wilderness," etc., ver. 26, Moses, in my
   opinion, has inserted by way of parenthesis: it will, therefore, be
   suitably rendered in the pluperfect tense, "But I had sent," etc. Thus
   there will be no ambiguity in the sense that, when the messengers had
   returned without effecting their purpose, God sustained the weariness
   of the people by this consolation, as though he had said, Sihon has
   not, with impunity, repudiated the peace offered to him, since it will
   now be permitted you to assail him in lawful war. And assuredly this
   signal for the expedition to advance depends on the declaration which
   is subjoined in ver. 30, as we may readily gather from the context; for
   Moses there repeats what we here read respecting their passage in
   somewhat different words; and again does God testify that He has given
   Sihon into the hands of the people, and exhorts Moses to go down boldly
   to the battle. Moreover, the cause is there specified why (Sihon) had
   been so arrogant and contemptuous in his rejection of the embassy,
   viz., because God had "hardened his spirit, and made his heart
   obstinate." From whence again it appears how poor is the sophistry of
   those who imagine that God idly regards from heaven what men are about
   to do. [128] They dare not, indeed, despoil Him of foreknowledge; but
   what can be more absurd than that He foreknows nothing except what men
   please? But Scripture, as we see, has not placed God in a watch-tower,
   from which He may behold at a distance what things are about to be; but
   teaches that He is the director (moderatorem) of all things; and that
   He subjects to His will, not only the events of things, but the designs
   and affections of men also. As, therefore, we have before seen how the
   heart of Pharaoh was hardened, so now Moses ascribes to God the
   obstinacy of king Sihon. How base a subterfuge is the exception which
   some make as to His permission, sufficiently appears from the end which
   Moses points out. [129] For why did God harden the heart of Sihon?
   thalt "He might deliver him into the hand" of His people to be slain;
   because He willed that he should perish, and had destined his land for
   the Israelites. If God only permitted Sihon to grow hardened, this
   decree was either nought, or mutable, and evanescent, since it depended
   on the changeable will of man. Putting aside, then, all childish
   trifling, we must conclude that God by His secret inspiration moves,
   forms, governs, and draws men's hearts, so that even by the wicked He
   executes whatever He has decreed. At the same time it is to be observed
   that the wicked are not impelled to hardness of heart by extrinsic
   force, but that they voluntarily harden themselves; so that in this
   same hardness of heart God may be seen to be a just judge, however
   incomprehensible His counsel may be, and however the impiety of men may
   betray itself, who are their own instigators, and the authors of their
   own sin. Emphatically does Moses inculcate the same thing twice over,
   viz., that the spirt of Sihon was hardened by God, and his heart made
   obstinate, in order that God's paternal favor towards His chosen people
   might be more conspicuous; because from the obstinacy of the blinded
   king He afforded them a just cause for war, and an opportunity for
   victory.

   Numbers 21:25 And Israel took all these cities. As if speaking of
   something present, he uses the demonstrative pronoun, and says, "these
   cities," just as if he were pointing them out to the eyes of his
   readers. The word which we have rendered "towns" (oppida,) [130] others
   translate "country-houses" (villas,) or "hamlets" (viculos.) In the
   Hebrew, Moses calls by the name of "daughters" all the villages and
   lesser towns, whose mother-city (metropolis) was Heshbon. By these
   words, however, Moses indicates that, by the right of war, all these
   places had fallen into the hands of the Israelites, as the lot of their
   inheritance; for, as I have lately said, God had not yet openly
   declared that they should be masters of this part of the country. They
   would consequently have over-passed their boundaries, unless these had
   been added to the land of Canaan. This is the reason why God openly
   declares that they possessed them by His authority. But when he says
   that the cities were destroyed, and all their inhabitants exterminated,
   so that neither women nor children were spared, let us understand that
   they dealt not thus cruelly of their own impulse, or in heedless
   violence, but that whatsoever was on the other side of Jordan was
   devoted to destruction by God, that they might always have their minds
   fixed on the promised land, and might never give way to listlessness,
   which would have been the case if an easy occupation of it had invited
   them to repose. Although, therefore, God delivered over the land to
   them hereafter, and suffered them to enrich themselves with its booty
   and spoils, yet He would not have it retained as a place of residence,
   and therefore commanded them to destroy its cities and villages, in
   order that they might seek their rest elsewhere. In fine, since they
   were abundantly disposed to be slothful, it was expedient that all
   snares should be removed, and that by the very desolation they might be
   urged forward whither God called them.

   26. For Heshbon was the city of Sihon. It is not without cause that
   Moses relates how the country near Heshbon had passed into the hands of
   the Amorites, because a long time afterwards this was sought for as a
   pretext for war by the Ammonites, when they saw that the people were
   brought into a low estate. In the time of Jephthah, therefore, having
   collected a great army, an irruption was made by them; and they made
   this their excuse, that they took up arms to recover what was their
   own, from Arnon as far as Jabbok, and as far as Jordan. Consequently,
   God would have it testified in the sacred records, as Jephthah then
   replied to the Ammonites, that this part of the land was taken from
   king Sihon, when the children of Israel were marching peacefully
   through the borders of the Ammonites. Designedly, then, did Moses, in
   order to sanction the right of the people, insert in these authentic
   registers, as it were, what had formerly occurred, namely, that the
   Amorites had had the dominion over that part of the country, without
   interference from the Ammonites; nor was there any question that the
   Amorites had secure and peaceful possession of it. Hence it follows
   that it passed to the Israelites, so that there were no grounds why,
   three hundred years afterwards, the Ammonites should reclaim what had
   so long been lost and abandoned by them. And, in order that posterity
   might know that there was then no obscurity about the matter, he
   records an ancient canticle, from which it appears that the Ammonites
   were so completely overcome, that their enemies triumphed magnificently
   over them, and cut off all hope of their restoration. Here, however,
   the question arises, why the king of Ammon, rather than the king of
   Moab, set on foot that war; for we clearly gather from the song, that
   the land was taken from the Moabites. But for men who are bent on
   rapine and robbery, it is sufficient to allege any trivial pretext, and
   often to glory in the rights of others. There doubtless remained a
   report that the Amorites had been driven out of their territories,
   [131] which they had obtained by force of arms. The Ammonites pass over
   in silence what had been forgotten in the lapse of many ages, and set
   up this false title, that, although the Israelites had conquered the
   Amorites, still their victory conferred upon them no right to occupy
   what the Amorites unjustly and forcibly held. With this object Moses
   inserted the account he here gives.

   27. Wherefore, they that speak in proverbs. That is, an old saying, or
   proverbial sentence remains, and is well known. The song, however,
   appears to have been composed in the character of those who, when
   prepared to engage in war, mutually exhorted each other, "Come into
   Heshbon," i.e., run to the standard of king Sihon; hasten to his home,
   and his chief place of abode, in order that we may thence go forth to
   battle. These expressions, "build and prepare," I interpret as being
   used for enlarge, adorn, and enrich; for it is probable that this city
   was not overthrown, but they foretell that the city would be renovated,
   when a larger dominion had been gained. And this is more fully
   confirmed by what immediately follows, when it is said that "a fire had
   gone forth from Heshbon," which consumed Ar of Moab, and all its
   neighborhood. As to the "lords of the high places of Arnon," some
   understand the priests who presided in the temples; others extend them
   to all the inhabitants in general; but, in my opinion, it will not be
   unsuitable to refer them to the idols themselves, since it appears from
   the next verse that the conquerors were so insolently elated, as not
   only to despise the men themselves, but their gods also; for when they
   say, "Thou art undone, O people of Chemosh," there is no doubt but that
   they mockingly reproach them with the fact that they had been badly
   defended by the gods whom they worshipped. [132] And, in point of fact,
   ungodly men, when in prosperity, uplift their horns to heaven, as if
   they would assail the divinity which was opposed to them. They,
   therefore, deride Chemosh, because he made "his sons" or worshippers to
   be fugitives or captives.

   In the word lantern [133] he makes use of a common metaphor. Some
   follow the Chaldee interpreter, and render it kingdom; but it has a
   wider signification; for it includes all the component parts of a happy
   and prosperous state. [134] The meaning, therefore, is, that their
   glory and all their wealth was annihilated. The cities of Dibon and
   Medeba are situated on the extreme borders, near the river Arnon, so
   that by these he designates all the intermediate plain.

   Numbers 21

   Numbers 21:33-35

   33. And they turned, and went up by the way of Bashan: and Og the king
   of Bashan went out against them, he, and all his people, to the battle
   at Edrei.

   33. Conversi autem ascenderunt per viam Basan, et egressus est Og rex
   Basan in occursum ipsis, ipse et universus populus ejus ad praelium in
   Edrei.

   34. And the Lord said unto Moses, Fear him not: for I have delivered
   him into thy hand, and all his people, and his land; and thou shalt do
   to him as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at
   Heshbon.

   34. Tunc dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Ne timeas eum: quia in manu tua dedi
   cumcet universum populum ejus, ae terram ejus: faciesque ei quemadmodum
   fecisti Sihon regi AEmorrhaeorum qui habitabat in Hesbon.

   35. So they smote him and his sons, and all his people, until there was
   none left him alive: and they possessed his land.

   35. Et percusserunt eum et fillios ejus, universumque populum ejus: ut
   non remanserit ei superstes: et possederunt terram ejus.


   33. And they turned and went up. Here there is another victory of the
   people described, wherein they again experienced the continued favor of
   God, in order that they may be aroused to greater alacrity, and
   courageously prepare themselves for farther progress; for they might
   confidently expect that, with God for their leader, all things would
   succeed prosperously with them. The region of Bashan, as Scripture
   informs us in many places, was fertile, and famous for its rich
   pastures; but Moses here also testifies to its great extent. It was,
   then, no ordinary proof of God's favor and aid, that they should take
   it in a moment, as it were. It is not, therefore, without cause, that,
   in the Psalm, God's power and goodness is magnified in reference to
   these victories; because He

   "slew mighty kings, Sihon king of the Amorites, and Og king of Bashan,
   and gave their land for a heritage, a heritage unto his people." (Psalm
   135:10-12.):

   For, although the Israelites were superior in numbers, yet there is no
   doubt but that, when this king dared to go forth to battle, he trusted
   in his forces, and deemed himself equal to resistance. Hence did God's
   grace shine forth the more conspicuously; and, indeed, in order that he
   may extol its greatness the more, Moses afterwards also relates that
   sixty cities were taken. [135]

   35. And the Lord said, unto Moses. God first of all exhorts His people
   to confidence. He then commands that the men as well as the cities and
   villages should be destroyed, so that nothing should be preserved
   except the booty. he indeed addresses Moses only, but his injunctions
   are directed to all, because Moses, who was already sufficiently
   energetic, had not so much need of being spurred on as the others. God,
   however, had regard to the future also, lest the recollection of the
   blessing should be lost through the ingratitude of the people. In
   promising them victory, therefore, he desired to have the praise of it
   bestowed upon Himself.

   I have already shewn why He commanded the cities to be overthrown, and
   all the houses utterly destroyed, namely, lest convenient habitations
   should tempt the people to torpor, when they were required to hasten
   onwards to the promised rest; for those who had been ready in the
   wilderness to retire, and to go back into Egypt, would have eagerly
   taken possession of this fertile land, and reposed themselves as in a
   delightful nest. By its desolation, therefore, they were compelled to
   abandon it. Its possession, indeed, was afterwards granted to the
   tribes of Reuben, and Gad, and half of Manasseh; but on condition that
   they should leave their herds there, and accompany their brethren
   through the whole expedition, not deserting them till the Canaanitish
   nations were destroyed.

   Deuteronomy 3

   Deuteronomy 3:1-11

   1. Then we turned, and went up the way to Bashan: and Og the king of
   Bashan came out against us, he and all his people, to battle at Edrei.

   1. Conversi autem aseendimus per viam Basan et egressus est Og rex
   Basan nobis in occursum, ipse et universus populus ejus ad praelium in
   Edrei.

   2. And the Lord said unto me, Fear him not: for I will deliver him, and
   all his people, and his land, into thy hand; and thou shalt do unto him
   as thou didst unto Sihon king of the Amorites, which dwelt at Heshbon.

   2. Et dixit Jehova ad me, ne timeas illum, nam in manu tua dedi eum, et
   universum populum ejus, ac terram ejus: faeiesque ei quemadmodum
   fecisti Sihon regi AEmorrhaeorum qui habitabat in Hesbon.

   3. So the Lord our God delivered into our hands Og also, the king of
   Bashan, and all his people: and we smote him, until none was left to
   him remaining.

   3. Tradidit itaque Jehova Deus noster etiam Og regem Basan, et
   universum populum ejus: percussimus eum, ut non reliquerimus ei
   superstitem.

   4. And we took all his cities at that time; there was not a city which
   we took not from them, threescore cities, all the region of Argob, the
   kingdom of Og in Bashan.

   4. Cepimus quoque omnes urbes ejus eo tempore: non fuit urbs ulla quam
   non ceperimus ab eis, nempe sexaginta urbes, omnem regionem Argob regni
   Og, in Basan.

   5. All these dries were fenced with high walls, gates, and bars;
   besides unwalled towns a great many.

   5. Omnes autem istae urbes erant munitae muris altis, portis et
   vectibus: praeter urbes non muratas multas valde.

   6. And we utterly destroyed them, as we did unto Sihon king of Heshbon,
   utterly destroying the men, women, and children, of every city.

   6. Quas vastavimus, quemadmodum fecimus Sihon regi Hesbon, vastando
   omnem urbem, viros, mulieres, et parvulos.

   7. But all the cattle, and the spoil of the cities, we took for a prey
   to ourselves.

   7. Omnia autem jumenta et spolia urbium praedati sumus nobis.

   8. And we took at that time, out of the hand of the two kings of the
   Amorites, the land that was on this side Jordan, from the river of
   Arnon unto mount Hermen;

   8. Tulimus itaque eo tempore terram; e manu duorum regum AEmorrhaeorum
   quae erat trans Jordanem a torrente Arnon usque ad montem Hermon.

   9. (Which Hermon the Sidonians call Sirion, and the Amorites call it
   Shenir;)

   9. (Sidonii vocant Hermon, Sirion, et Emorrhaei vocant eum Senir.)

   10. All the cities of the plain, and all Gilead, and all Bashan, unto
   Salchah, and Edrei, cities of the kingdom of Og in Bashan:

   10. Onmes urbes planitiei, et totum Gilad, et omnem Basan usque ad
   Salchah, et Edrei, urbes regni Og in Basan.

   11. For only Og king of Bashan remained of the remnant of giants;
   behold, his bedstead was a bedstead of iron: is it not in Rabbath of
   the children of Ammon? nine cubits was the length thereof, and four
   cubits the breadth of it, after the cubit of a man.

   11. Solus quippe Og rex Basan remanserat ex reliquis gigantibus: ecce
   Iectus ejus, lectus ferreus, nonne est in Rabbath filiorum Ammon? novem
   cubitorum longitudo ejus, et quatuor cubitorum latitudo ejus ad cubitum
   hominis.


   4. And we took all the cities. He here more fully relates what He had
   brieflytouched upon in Numbers. He says that sixty, well-fortified
   cities were taken, besides the villages. Hence we infer both the extent
   of the country, and also the special power of God in the aid He
   afforded them, in that they took, in so short a time, so many cities
   well closed in, and begirt with high walls; as if they were merely
   travelling, through a peaceful land in security, and with nothing to
   do.

   After the eighth verse, lie repeats connectedly what he had separately
   related respecting the two kingdoms; and in order that the places might
   be more certainly identified, he mentions two other names for mount
   Hermon, stating that it was called Sirion by the Sidonians, and Shenir
   by the Amorites. Finally, he adds that Og, king of Bashan, was a giant,
   and the only survivorof that race. As a memorialof his lofty stature,
   he alleges his iron bedstead, the length of which was as much as nine
   cubits, according to the common measure of that period. By this
   circumstance he again magnifies the marvellous help of God, in that he
   was overcome by the children of Israel, who might, by his stature, have
   singly terrified a whole army.

   The enormous stature of the giants is apparent from this passage.
   Herodotus records, [136] that the body of Orestes, disinterred by
   command of the oracle, was seven cubits in length. Pliny, [137]
   although he does not cite his authority, subscribes to this testimony.
   Gellius [138] thinks that this was fabulous, as also what Homer [139]
   writes with respect to the diminution of men's height in process of
   time; but his erroneous view is confuted by almost universal consent.
   What Pliny [140] himself relates is indeed incredible, that in Crete a
   body was discovered, by an opening of the earth, forty-six cubits long,
   which some thought to be the body of Orion, and others of Etion. But if
   we believe that there were giants, (which is not only affirmd by the
   sacred Scriptures, but also recorded by almost all ancient writers,) we
   need not be surprised if they were more than eight cubits in height.
   Although, however, the race of giants began to disappear in the time of
   Moses, still, in after ages, there existed persons who approached to
   this ancient stature, [141] as in the time of Augustus and Claudius
   there was one man about ten feet in height, and another nine feet nine
   inches. Moses, therefore, intimates nothing more than that this
   monstrous race of men gradually died out, so that the enormous height
   of Og, king of Bashan, was an unusual sight.

   whose height was nine feet nine inches; and adds, that in the reign of
   Augustus, there lived two persons, Posio and Secundilla, who were half
   a foot higher than Gabbara, and who, on account of their wonderful
   size, were buried in the cemetery of the Sallustian gardens.

   Numbers 22

   Numbers 22:1-41

   1. And the children of Israel set forward, and pitched in the plains of
   Moab, on this side Jordan by Jericho.

   1. Inde profecti sunt filii Israel, et castrametati sunt in
   campestribus Moab trans Jordanem Jericho.

   2. And Balak the son of Zippor saw all that israel had done to the
   Amorites.

   2. Quum autem vidisset Balac filius Sippor qumcunque fecerat Israel
   Emorrhaeo:

   3. And Moab was sore afraid of the people, because they were many; and
   Moab was distressed because of the children of Israel.

   3. Timuit Moab propter populum valde, quod multus esset: et anxius fuit
   Moab propter filios Israel.

   4. And Moab said unto the elders of Midian, Now shall this company lick
   up all that are round about us, as the ox licketh up the grass of the
   field. And Balak the son of Zippor was king of the Moabites at that
   time.

   4. Dixit igitur Moab ad seniores Madian, Nunc lambet congregatio haec
   omnes circuitus nostros, quemadmodum lambit bos gramen agri. Porto
   Balac filius Sippor erat rex Moab tempore illo.

   5. He sent messengers therefore unto Baalam the son of Beor, to Pethor,
   which is by the river of the land of the children of his people, to
   call him, saying, Behold, there is a people come out from Egypt:
   behold, they cover the face of the earth, and they abide over against
   me.

   5. Misit igitur legatos ad Balaam filium Beor in Pethor, quae erat
   juxta flumen terrae filiorum populi sui, ut vocaret eum, dicendo, En
   populus egressus est ex Aegypto, ecce, operuit superficiem terrae, et
   habitat contra me.

   6. Come now, therefore, I pray thee, curse me this people; for they are
   too mighty for me: peradventure I shall prevail, that we may smite
   them, and that I may drive them out of the land: for I wot that he whom
   thou blessest is blessed, and he whom thou cursest is cursed.

   6. Nunc ergo veni, obsecro, maledic mihi populum hunc, quia fortior me
   est: fortepotero, et percutiam eum, expellamque e terra. Novi enim quod
   cui benedixeris benedictus erit, et cui maledixeris maledictus erit.

   7. And the elders of Moab and the elders of Midian departed with the
   rewards of divination in their hand; and they came unto Baalam, and
   spake unto him the words of Balak.

   7. Profecti ergo sunt seniores Madian, et divinationes in manu eorum:
   et pervenerunt ad Balaam, et retulerunt ei vrrba Balac.

   8. And he said unto them, Lodge here this night, and I will bring you
   word again, as the Lord shall speak unto me. And the princes of Moab
   abode with Balaam.

   8. Ille vero dixit eis, Pernoctate hic nocte ista, et reddam vobis
   responsum, quemadmodum loquetur Jehova ad me. Manseruntque principes
   Moab cum Balaam.

   9. And God came unto Balaam, and said, What men are these with thee?

   9. Et venit Deus ad Balaam, ac dixit, Qui sunt viri isti qui sunt apud
   te?

   10. And Balaam said unto God, Balak the son of Zippor, king of Moab,
   hath sent unto me, saying,

   10. Respondit Balaam Deo, Balac filius Sippor rex Moab misit ad me:

   11. Behold, there is a people come out of Egypt, which covereth the
   face of the earth: come now, curse me them; peradventure I shall be
   able to overcome them, and drive them out.

   11. En populus iste qui egressus est ex AEgypto operuit superficiem
   terrae: nunc ergo veni, maledic mihi illi: forte potero pugnare cum eo,
   et expellere eum.

   12. And God said unto Baalam, Thou shalt not go with them; thou shalt
   not curse the people: for they are blessed.

   12. Et dixit Deus ad Balaam, Ne eas cum illis, neque maledicas populo
   qui benedictus est.

   13. And Balaam rose up in the morning, and said unto the princes of
   Balak, Get you into your land: for the Lord refuseth to give me leave
   to go with you

   13. Surrexit itaque Balaam mane, et dixit ad principes Balac,
   Revertimini ad terram vestram: quia renuit Jehova concedere mihi, ut
   eam vobiscum.

   14. And the princes of Moab rose up, and they went unto Balak, and
   said, Balaam refuseth to come with us.

   14. Et surrexerunt principes Moab, et perverternut ad Balac, ac
   dixerunt, Renuit Balaam venire nobiscum.

   15. And Balak sent yet again princes, more, and more honorable than
   they.

   15. Rursus ergo misit Balac principes plures, et nobiliores istis.

   16. And they came to Balaam, and said to him, Thus saith Balak the son
   of Zippor, Let nothing, I pray thee, hinder thee from coming unto me;

   16. Qui venientes ad Balaam dixerunt ei, Sic dixit Balac filius Sippor,
   Noli quaeso prohibere teipsum ne venias ad me:

   17. For I will promote thee unto very great honor, and I will do
   whatsoever thou sayest unto me: come therefore, I pray thee, curse me
   this people.

   17. Nam honorando honorabo te valde, et quicquid dixeris mihi, faciam:
   veni igitur obsecro, et maledic mihi populo huic.

   18. And Balaam answered and said unto the servants of Balak, If Balak
   would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot go beyond the
   word of the Lord my God, to do less or more.

   18. Respendens autem Balaam dixit servis Balac, Etiamsi daturus sit
   mihi Balac plenam domum suam argento et auro, non possim transgredi
   sermonem Jehoare Dei mei, ut faciam aliquid, sive parvum, sive magnum.

   19. Now therefore, I pray you, tarry ye also here this night, that I
   may know what the Lord will say unto me more.

   19. Nunc ergo manete, obsecro, hic vos quoque hac nocte, ut sciam quid
   addet Jehova loqui mihi.

   20. And God came unto Balaam at night, and said unto him, If the men
   come to call thee, rise up, and go with them; but yet the word which I
   shall say unto thee, that shalt thou do.

   20. Tunc venit Deus ad Balaam nocte, et dixit ei, Si vocandum te
   venerint viri isti, surge, vade cum eis: veruntamen quod dixero tibi,
   illud facies.

   21. And Balaam rose up in the morning, and saddled his ass, and went
   with the princes of Moab.

   21. Surrexit itaque Balaam mane, et stravit asinam suam, et perrexit
   cum principibus Moab.

   22. And God's anger was kindled because he went: and the angel of the
   Lord stood in the way for an adversary against him. (Now he was riding
   upon his ass, and his two servants were with him.)

   22. Iratus vero est furor Dei quod ipse iret cum illis: stetitque
   angelus Jehovae in ipsa via, in adversarium illi: ipse autem equitabat
   super asinam suam, et duo pueri ejus erant cum co.

   23. And the ass saw the angel of the Lord standing in the way, and his
   sword drawn in his hand: and the ass turned aside out of the way, and
   went into the field; and Balaam smote the ass, to turn her into the
   way.

   23. At videns asina angelum Jehovae stantem in via, et gladium ejus
   evaginatam in manu ejus, declinavit ilia e via, et ivit in agrum:
   itaque percussit Balaam asinam ut declinare faceret eam in viam.

   24. But the angel of the Lord stood in a path of the vineyards, a wall
   being on this side, and a wall on that side.

   24. Stetitque postea angelus Jehovae in semita vinearum: maceria una
   erat hinc, et maceria altera inde.

   25. And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she thrust herself unto
   the wall, and crushed Balaam's foot against the wall; and he smote her
   again.

   25. Videns vero secundo asina angelum Jehovae, coarctavit sese parieti,
   coarctavit quoque pedem Balaam ad parietem: propterea addidit percutere
   cam.

   26. And the angel of the Lord went further, and stood in a narrow
   place, where was no way to turn either to the right hand or to the
   left.

   26. Addidit praeterea angelus Jehovae transire, et stetit in loco
   angusto ubi nulla erat via ad declinandum sire ad dextram sire ad
   sinistram.

   27. And when the ass saw the angel of the Lord, she fell down under
   Balaam: and Balaam's anger was kindled, and he smote the ass with a
   staff.

   27. Quum autem vidisset asina angelum Jehovah, succubuit sub Balaam,
   unde iratus furor Balaam percussit asinam baculo.

   28. And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass; and she said unto Balaam,
   What have I done unto thee, that thou hast smitten me these three
   times?

   28. Et aperuit Jehova os asinae, dixitque ilia ad Balaam, Quid feci
   tibi, quod percussisti me jam tribus vicibus:

   29. And Balaam said unto the ass, Because thou hast mocked me: I would
   there were a sword in mine hand, for now would I kill thee.

   29. Tunc dixit Balaam ad asinam, Quia illusisti mihi, utinam esset
   gladius in manu mea, certe nunc occiderem te.

   30. And the ass said unto Balaam, Am not I thine ass, upon which thou
   hast ridden ever since I was thine unto this day? was I ever wont to do
   so unto thee? And he said, Nay.

   30. Dixit autem asina ad Balaam, Nonne sum asina tua? super me
   equitasti ex quo esse coepisti usque ad diem hanc, nunquid solita sum
   facere tibi sic? Qui respondit, Nequaquam.

   31. Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam, and he saw the angel of
   the Lord standing in the way, and his sword drawn in his hand: and he
   bowed down his head, and fell flat on his face.

   31. Et detexit Jehova oculos Balaam, viditque angelum Jehovae stantem
   in via, et gladium ejus evaginatum in manu ejus: tum demisso capite
   adoravit pronus in faciem suam.

   32. And the angel of the Lord said unto him, Wherefore hast thou
   smitten thine ass these three times? Behold, I went out to withstand
   thee, because thy way is perverse before me:

   32. Et alloquutus est eum angelus Jehovae, Quare percussisti asinam
   tuam jam tribus vicibus? en ego egressus sum in adversarium tibi, quia
   declinavit a via coram me.

   33. And the ass saw me, and turned from me these three times: unless
   she had turned from me, surely now also I had slain thee, and saved her
   alive.

   33. Et vidit me asina, declinavit-que ante me jam tribus vicibus: quod
   si non declinasset a facie mea, jam nunc etiam te occidissem, et ipsam
   vivam reservassem.

   31. And Balaam said unto the angel of the Lord, I have sinned; for I
   knew not that thou stoodest in the way against me: now therefore, if it
   displease thee, I will get me back again.

   34. Dixit igitur Balaam ad angelum Jehovae, Peccavi: non enim sciebam
   quod tu stares in occursum mei in via: Nunc autem si malum est in
   oculis tuis, revertar mihi.

   35. And the angel of the Lord said unto Balaam, Go with the men: but
   only the word that I shall speak unto thee, that thou shalt speak. So
   Balaam went with the princes of Balak.

   35. Angelus vero Jehovae dixit ad Balaam, Vade cum istis viris:
   veruntamen verbum quod loquar ad te illud loqueris. Abiit igitur Balaam
   cum principibus Balac:

   36. And when Balak heard that Balaam was come, he went out to meet him
   unto a city of Moab, which is in the border of Arnon, which is in the
   utmost coast.

   36. Audiens vero Balac quod adveniret Balaam, egressus est in occursam
   ejus in civitatem quandam Moab, quae erat juxta terminun Arnon, quae
   est in extremo finium.

   37. And Balak said unto Balaam, Did I not earnestly send unto thee to
   call thee? wherefore camest thou not unto me? am I not able indeed to
   promote thee to honor?

   37. Et dixit Balac ad Balaam, Annon mittendo misi ad te ad accersendum
   te? an vere non possum honorare te?

   38. And Balaam said unto Balak, Lo, I am come unto thee: have now any
   power at all to say any thing? the word that God putteth in my mouth,
   that shall I speak.

   38. Respondit autem Balaam ad Balac, Ecce veni ad te: nunc autem
   nunquid omnino potero loqui quicquam? Verbum quod posuerit Deus in ore
   meo, illud loquar.

   39. And Balaam went with Balak, and they came unto Kirjath-huzoth.

   39. Et perrexit Balaam cum Balac, et pervenerunt in civitatem Husoth:

   40. And Balak offered oxen and sheep, and sent to Balaam, and to the
   princes that were with him.

   40. Et mactavit Balac boves, et oves: misitque ad Balaam et ad
   principes qui cum ipso erant.

   41. And it came to pass on the morrow, that Balak took Balaam, and
   brought him up into the high places of Baal, that thence he might see
   the utmost part of the people.

   41. Postera autem die accepit Balac ipsum Balaam, et ascendere fecit
   eum in excelsa Baal, et vidit illinc extremum populi.


   1. And the children, of Israel set forward. This narrative contains
   many circumstances worthy of record: First, it shews that there is no
   stone which Satan does not turn for the destruction of the Church, and
   that, after he has assailed her in vain by force of arms, he attacks
   her by snares and secret artifices, whilst the ungodly also work under
   his impulse, as far as they are able, to overthrow her by deceit, and
   to make the promises of God, and His unchangeable decree for the
   preservation of the Church which He has chosen, of none effect. But God
   shews, on the other hand, that He so watches over His own, as to turn
   to their salvation whatever plots their enemies may devise for their
   destruction. He likewise represents as in a mirror how foolish and vain
   are their attempts who endeavor to undermine the grace of God; and
   especially He demonstrates that God's truth will always be so
   completely victorious as to receive the testimony even of its professed
   enemies; just as Balaam was made to proclaim it. These and other
   observations, however, will be better made in their several places.

   We have already seen that there was no reason why Balak should devise
   any evil against God's people, since he had no inconvenience to fear
   from them. Their faith had been voluntarily pledged; security had been
   promised him, and a treaty proposed. When, therefore, he and all the
   Moabites prepare themselves, and arouse their neighbors for resistance,
   they were ungrateful to God as well as men. In his very alarm we see
   the truth of what Scripture declares, viz., that the reprobate are
   always agitated by groundless terrors; and this is the just reward of
   those who seek not peace with God, that they should be constantly
   harassed by wretched disquietude. By special privilege God had exempted
   the Moabites from being at all interfered with; but they invent for
   themselves causes of anxiety, because they see that God's people had
   overcome great and powerful kings. For as the brightness of the sun is
   painful and injurious to those who have weak eyes, so the blessings
   which God bestows upon the Church, in token of His paternal favor,
   torment the reprobate and stir them up to envy. If the Moabites had
   prudently considered their own advantage, they might have easily so
   arranged with their old connections as to provide for their own
   tranquillity; but now, by provoking their ill-will, they make the worst
   bargain possible for themselves. Nor is it the unwise alarm of Balak
   only which is described, but that of the whole nation of Moab. At
   first, indeed, the king's name is introduced alone, but immediately
   afterwards Moses includes them all without exception, hence it is plain
   that this error was universal, by the contagion of which they presently
   corrupt others also. For they invite the Midianites to associate
   themselves with them in the work of repulsing the Israelites. The
   pretext alleged is, that as oxen consume the grass of the field, so
   there was imminent danger lest if the people of Israel were not
   resisted, they should as it were lick up and devour all the nations;
   whereas they had experienced quite the reverse, for the people had
   turned aside of their own accord into circuitous paths, in order to
   avoid doing them injury. This forbearance would have delivered them
   from all anxiety, unless their own malignity had taught them to
   entertain foul suspicions; for why had not the Israelites made a direct
   aggression upon their territories, except because they were desirous to
   leave them safe and intact? Otherwise they would have boldly made a way
   for themselves by force of arms.

   5. He sent messengers therefore unto Balaam. This passage shews us,
   like many others, that the errors wherein Satan entangles unbelievers
   are derived from good principles. The modesty of king Balak appears to
   be worthy of praise, in that, conscious of his own weakness, and
   placing no confidence in human aid, he sets about imploring the help of
   God. For this is our only safe refuge, although earthly aids may fail
   us, still to maintain our courage, and to rely upon God, who is
   all-sufficient in Himself, and independent of external means. Thus far,
   then, Balak acts rightly, for he seeks nothing more than to conciliate
   God's favor, nor places his confidence of victory in anything but God's
   good-will; but, when he seeks for God amiss by circuitous ways, he
   departs far from Him. And this is a common error with all hypocrites
   and unbelievers, that, whilst they aspire after God, they wander into
   indirect paths of their own. Balak desires Divine deliverance from his
   danger; but the means are of his own device, when he would purchase
   incantations from a mercenary prophet; thus it is, that he binds down
   God, and subjects Him to his own inventions. He knows, he says, that
   the power of blessing and cursing appertained to Balaam; but, whence
   arose this persuasion, unless, [142] by catching at the more empty name
   of Prophet, he separates God from Himself? He ought first to have
   inquired what the will of God was, and to have addressed prayer in
   earnest faith to Him, in order to propitiate Him; whereas, omitting the
   main thing, he is satisfied with a mere venal blessing. We gather,
   therefore, from his anxiety to obtain peace and pardon from God, that
   there was some seed of religion implanted in his mind. The reverence
   which he pays to the Prophet is also a sign of his piety. But that he
   desires to win over God by his own vain inventions is a proof of
   foolish superstition; and that he seeks to lay Him under obligation to
   himself, of impious pride. [143]

   I know not how it came into the mind of the Chaldee interpreter to
   suppose that Pether was on the banks of the Euphrates; nor is it
   probable that (Balaam) was fetched from so great a distance. Neither
   would his celebrity have extended from so distant a place to these
   nations. I am persuaded that it is the proper name of a place, because
   the termination of the word Petorah does not admit of its being an
   epithet, such as "the soothsayer," as Jerome has rendered it. Although,
   however, the country is not specified, it is probably gathered from the
   context that Balaam was a Midianite; and for this reason I conceive the
   Midianites were sought in alliance, in order that they might gain over
   their fellow-countrymen.

   It is a poor exposition of what follows in verse 7, that they had "the
   divinations in their hand," [144] to refer it to the art of divination,
   or even that they were accompanied by those who were skillful in the
   same science. It is more simple to interpret it of their commission, as
   though Moses said that the messengers were instructed as to what they
   sought of Balaam, viz., that he should curse the people of Israel, for
   there is no absurdity in supposing that Moses again repeats what he had
   related in the preceding verse. Still, I am not indisposed to accept
   the view which others take, viz., that they took with them the reward
   or price of divination, for there have been in all ages hireling
   prophets who made a sale of their revelations; and since even amongst
   the Israelites many impostors thus set themselves up for hire, this
   abuse had much vogue (among them.) Hence it was that Saul and his
   servant hesitated to go to Samuel, because they had not any gift at
   hand to offer him, until the servant replied that he had the fourth
   part of a shekel of silver, as if Samuel set up his prophecies for
   sale, as was commonly the case. (1 Samuel 9:7, 8.) Ezekiel, indeed,
   charges the false prophets with this, that they sold themselves for a
   trifling bribe.

   8. And he said unto them, Lodge here this night. Inasmuch as he waits
   for a revelation from the true God, it is probable that he was not a
   magician or sorcerer, whose only power to divine arose from
   superstition or evil arts. We shall, indeed, see hereafter, that he was
   accustomed to use many impostures and deceptions; but it will be plain,
   from the evidence of facts, that he was furnished with the gift of
   prophecy. Not that he is to be reckoned among the true prophets whom
   God set over His Church, because neither was the perpetual office of
   prophesying conferred upon him, nor was it conjoined with that of
   teaching. For those servants of His, to whom God intrusted the office
   of prophesying, He so directed by His Spirit, that they never spoke
   except out of His mouth. And although they did not foresee all that was
   to happen, but only according to the measure of their revelation, still
   He concealed nothing from them which it was profitable for them to
   know. Hence the expression of Amos,

   "Surely the Lord God will do nothing, but he revealeth his secret unto
   his servants the prophets." (Amos 3:7.)

   In a word, they were the organs of the Holy Spirit for all necessary
   predictions; and the credit due to their prophecies was of an equable
   and constant character, so that they never spoke absurdly or in vain.
   Besides, they were endowed with the power of adapting their prophecies
   to a just object and use. Thus, after the Law was promulgated, they
   were its interpreters. In prosperity they bore witness to the grace of
   God; in adversity, to His judgments. In fine, their business was to
   ratify God's covenant, whereby He reconciles men to Himself through
   Christ. Far different was the case with Balaam, and such like, who were
   only endued with a particular gift, [145] so that they truly foretold
   some things, and were mistaken in others; and, indeed, they only
   uttered bare revelations without any admixture of doctrine. God willed,
   indeed, that such should exist even among heathen nations, so that some
   sparks of light should shine amidst their darkness, and thus the excuse
   of ignorance should be taken away. Indeed, all those who have dared to
   delude the world by their impostures have usurped the name of prophet;
   and although the word divination is honorable and sacred, it has been
   improperly applied to the art of deception, and the liberty to lie, as
   it is the custom of the devil to profane God's name by its impious
   abuse. Still, there were some among the Gentiles who occasionally
   predicted future events by divine inspiration; and this was especially
   the case before the Law was given, inasmuch as God had not then
   distinguished His elect people from others by this mark. At this time,
   it is true, the promise had been given,

   "The Lord thy God will raise up unto thee prophets," [146] etc,
   (Deuteronomy 18:15.);

   but it was not yet generally known, and therefore God was unwilling
   that the nations should be deprived of their soothsayers, who still
   were very different from those true prophets, whose call was clear and
   legitimate.

   I have said thus much briefly with reference to Balaam, whom God
   addresses in a vision by night, or dream, no less familiarly than any
   of His own servants; but only on a particular point. By the inquiry,
   "What men are these with thee?" Hie indirectly reproves his improper
   desires. At first sight he pretends a holy anxiety to obey, when he
   dares to attempt nothing without God's permission, and refuses to stir
   a foot, until he shall have received His answer. Yet secret
   covetousness influences him to obtain from God, by bargaining as it
   were, what he still feels not to be right. God glances at this
   astuteness, when He inquires respecting the men; as much as to say,
   that there was no reason why he should detain them a moment, since
   their demand should have been peremptorily refused. And, assuredly, if
   he had been free, he would have hastened at once to obey the wishes of
   king Balak, even contrary to the will of God. He now requests that
   permission should be given him; as if he desired to have the reins,
   which withheld him from his evil purposes, slackened, when he would
   have willingly shaken them off altogether, if he were not well aware
   that he could do nothing further than God would permit. Nor, indeed,
   does he regard what is lawful and right; but only seeks that his mouth
   may be opened to curse with impunity.

   12. Thou shalt not go with them. If there were any room for doubt, God
   peremptorily removes it, and confirms the prohibition; because it was
   unlawful to curse, those whom He had blessed. For nothing more is
   permitted to prophets than that they should be the witnesses, or
   ambassadors (internuntii,) or heralds of the grace which God freely
   deigns to bestow at His own pleasure upon whom He will. Moreover, God
   is said to bless those whom He has embraced with His favor, and to whom
   He experimentally declares Himself to be propitious, when He displays
   His liberality towards them. Of this blessing He willed that the
   prophets should be His ministers in such a manner that the power should
   still remain altogether in His own hands. If, therefore, they usurp to
   themselves the prerogative of blessing without His commission, their
   act is not merely frivolous and inefficacious, but even blasphemous.
   Justly, then, does Ezekiel convict of falsehood and deception those
   false prophets, who, by their flatteries, encourage the souls which
   were doomed to die; whilst they slay by their terrors and threats those
   to whom God had promised life. (Ezekiel 13:2 and 22.) Hence we gather,
   how vain it is for hypocrites, as they are wont to do, to purchase
   pardon from men in order to propitiate God; and also that we need not
   be afraid of those degenerate ministers, [147] who desire to domineer
   tyrannically in virtue of their office, although they launch their
   fulminations against the innocent.

   It is plain, however, that Balaam's obedience to God's command does not
   proceed from the heart. His words, indeed, might deceive the simple,
   from their appearance of humility; "I will not go, because God forbids
   it; "but there is no doubt but that, led as he was to gratify them by
   ambition and by avarice, he indicates that he would be disposed to
   undertake the journey, unless he were forbidden by God. If his heart
   had been sincere, the honest reply he should have given was obvious,
   viz., that it was vain to send either for himself or any one else, in
   order that Balak might resist the inviolable decree of God. If he had
   thus heartily and unequivocally given glory to God, another embassy
   would not have been sent to him; but by his faltering excuse he
   appeared to inflame the desire of the foolish king, in order to sell
   his curse at a higher price; for we know that this is the usual way
   with impostors, that they obtain higher pay for themselves in
   proportion to the difficulty of the matter. Still, however, if we
   compare the mercenary prophets of the Pope with Balaam, his servile and
   enforced submission will deserve no little praise by the side of their
   detestable and indomitable folly, who, in despite of God, hesitate not
   to burst forth in impious curses. The truth, which they oppugn, is
   conspicuous: that terrible judgment, which (God) denounces by the mouth
   of Isaiah, rings in their ears, "Woe unto them that put darkness for
   light, and light for darkness," (Isaiah 5:20;) nevertheless they
   proceed, and in their brutal madness vomit forth their blasphemies not
   only to the destruction of the Church, but, if it were possible, to the
   extinction of all religion.

   15. And Balak sent yet again princes. Here we see that, however humbly
   ungodly men implore God's grace, still they do not lay aside their
   pride; as if their grandeur could avail to dazzle the eyes of God. In
   order, therefore, to make Him comply with their wishes, they think it
   enough to display their magnificent ceremonies; and, indeed, whatever
   modesty superstition may pretend, it always swells with secret
   confidence Thus Balak, in order to obtain favor, makes a show of his
   dignity and power, and deems that Balaam will be thus at his service.
   Although, however, the impostor shews much more spirit in this his
   second reply than before, still his hypocrisy is soon discovered, and
   he betrays the duplicity of his mind. It is, indeed, a noble speech,
   and indicative of much magnanimity, "If Balak would give me his house
   full of silver and gold, I will not disobey the command of God:" but
   why does he not instantly banish from him altogether these unholy
   traffickers, who are instigating him to transgression? We see, then,
   that he speaks rather in a spirit of boasting, than to ascribe to God
   the glory due to Him; for his desire was to acquire for himself the
   title and credit of a holy Prophet by this parade of obedience. In the
   meantime, when he begs that a season of delay should be granted him for
   the purpose of inquiring what God's pleasure was, he is convicted of
   impious rebellion. He does not dare openly, and in flagrant contempt of
   God, to put himself forward for the purpose of cursing God's people:
   and so far well: but why does he not acquiesce in the Divine decision?
   why, when he has been assured whether a matter was lawful or not, does
   he still doubtingly inquire? For thus does he deliberate, and question
   whether that which God has once prescribed ought to be certain and
   unchangeable; nay, he endeavors to force God to alter His
   determination. From the time that he had heard, "Thou shalt not go,"
   upon what pretense was it permissible to continue the controversy?
   This, then, is the object of Balaam's endeavor, that God, by
   withdrawing the decision which He had pronounced, should deny Himself;
   and this was an act of most blasphemous impiety. Still many such
   persons will be found now-a-days, who, though fully assured of the will
   of God, cease not nevertheless to countermine it, so that they may at
   length attain the end, towards which they are hurried by their lawless
   cupidity. At the outset, it is anything but their desire to know what
   is right; or, when they know it, to follow it: but ambition instigates
   some, lust inflames others, and others are urged forward by avarice: in
   a word, evil affections preside over every deliberation. Straightway
   God interposes some obstacle, and compels them, whether they will or
   no, to understand what they ought to do. They proceed, however,
   notwithstanding; and, inasmuch as the way is closed, they endeavor by
   subterfuges, by crooked paths or evasions, to elude the sure word of
   God; and, although they appear to do this modestly, because they
   hesitate until permission shall have been obtained from God, yet herein
   does their impudence betray itself, that they do not cease to importune
   God and His prophets, until they have extorted what they have already
   heard to be unlawful. It is plain, therefore, that all those are
   disciples of Balaam, who try the indulgence, of God, that He may at
   length permit them to attempt what; He has once refused.

   20. And God came to Balaam at, night. Although God is far from being
   deceitful, still hypocrites with their quibbles deserve that He should
   delude their craft. If we more closely consider the desire of Balaam,
   it was that God should belie Himself. For, if he was persuaded that He
   was truthful, what else was there to be hoped except that he should
   ratify His reply ten times over? Nevertheless, he wickedly lies to God,
   when he asks for a permission to go, which would convict God Himself of
   capriciousness and inconstancy. God, therefore, ironically permits what
   He had before forbidden. If any should deem it to be absurd that God,
   who is truth itself, should speak deceptively, the answer is easily
   found, viz., that God was guilty of no falsehood, but that He loosed
   the reins to a man obstinate in his own perverseness, just as a person
   might emancipate a wayward and grossly immoral son, because he will not
   suffer himself to be ruled. For had not his ungodly covetousness
   blinded Balaam, the meaning of this ironical permission was not
   difficult to be understood. Hence, then, let hypocrites learn, that
   they profit nothing by their vain pretences, although God may indulge
   them for a time, since He at length taketh the wily in their own
   craftiness; wherefore, nothing is better than, in pure and simple
   teachableness, to inquire what He would have us do, that we may
   instantly succumb, nor try to alter a word or a syllable as soon as He
   shall have deigned to open His holy mouth to instruct us. For to call
   in question what has been decided by Him, what is it but to compel Him
   by our importunity to bend Himself to our wishes?

   22. And God's anger was kindled because he went. How is it consistent
   that God should be angry when Balaam had attempted nothing, thus far,
   contrary to His command? But we must bear in mind, what I have lately
   hinted, that God apparently permits much which He does not approve. He
   allowed the people in the wilderness to eat flesh: He permitted men to
   give a writing of divorce to their wives, and even to marry several at
   once; still it was not right for them to eat the flesh, nor were
   divorce and polygamy free from culpability. At any rate, Balaam sinned
   by pertinaciously urging what was sinful, and thus deserved the
   punishment of death, though God was pleased to mitigate it. On this
   point it behoves us also to be soberly wise, lest, when God's secret
   judgments differ from our moral sense, we should cry out against Him.
   That prophet, who, having faithfully delivered his message, tasted
   bread on his way back, and this at the instigation of another prophet,
   so that he only fell through carelessness and want of reflection, He
   punished with death, (1 Kings 13;) in this case, the punishment which
   He inflicts upon an impostor and cheat, who [148] prostitutes his
   tongue for hire, is no harsher than to terrify him by threats. Here the
   temerity of the flesh would willingly lay hold of the occasion to find
   fault with God; but the fact was, that the punishment which awaited
   Balaam, and from which he did not finally escape, was delayed for a
   certain period in order to display more brightly the glory of God.
   Wherefore, if a doubt ever pervades our minds, when the reason for any
   of God's works is not apparent, let us learn at once to repress it.

   The external manifestation of God's anger is afterwards described;
   i.e., that the Angel meets him with a drawn sword; wherein we may
   observe that, to the great disgrace of the Prophet, the glory of the
   Angel was first revealed to the ass. For, although the Angel had
   assumed a body, by the sight of which a brute-animal might be affected,
   how did it come to pass that the ass was terrified at this alarm ing
   sight, whilst the eyes of the Prophet were closed against it, unless
   because God wished to brand the stupidity of this faithless man with a
   mark of ignominy? He had previously boasted of his extraordinary
   visions; a vision now escapes him which was manifest to the eyes of a
   beast. Whence did such blindness as this arise, except from avarice, by
   which he was so stupified as to prefer filthy lucre to the holy calling
   of God? In a word, in him was fulfilled, what Scripture so often
   denounces against the reprobate, that he was struck by a spirit of
   dizziness and folly so as to be unable to perceive anything. I have
   already said, that although angels are naturally invisible, yet that
   they assume bodies whenever God so pleases, and act in the character of
   human beings. Who supplied the Angel with a sword? Even He, who created
   all things out of nothing. If any curious person should go further, and
   inquire of what material the sword was made? it will be easy to reprove
   his folly by another question, viz., Whether it is easier for mortal
   man or for God to apply iron and steel to their various purposes? And
   it might be the case that a bright light shone from the sword, as when
   the Cherubim were placed with swords to shut the entrance of Paradise
   against Adam. In a word, God clothed His Angel in such a form as might
   strike with terror both the brute-animal and the false prophet. But He
   began with the ass, in order to put the stolidity of the wicked man
   more completely to shame.

   Moses proceeds to relate how the ass, first of all, was turned aside
   out of the way, and then, when she was met in a narrow place, how she
   tremblingly started back so as to crush her master's foot against the
   wall, and at length how she fell down under him. Surely this miserable
   impostor ought to have been awakened, if he had not been fascinated by
   the devil. But Moses carefully details all these circumstances, in
   order to show that he was not only deprived of common sense, but so
   utterly astounded, as to pay no attention to a most illustrious
   miracle.

   28. And the Lord opened the mouth of the ass. Sceptical persons
   criticize this passage, and ridicule it, as if Moses related an
   incredible fable. And, indeed, their scoff appears to be plausible,
   when they object that there is a great difference between the bray of
   all ass and all articulate voice; but, however they may now indulge in
   such wanton observations, they will at length be made to feel how
   seriously and reverently we ought to speak of the marvellous works of
   God, by their jokes and trifling about which they seek to appear
   facetious. Now, since their chattering is unworthy of a lengthened
   refutation, let us be satisfied by the contempt into which it is thrown
   by a single expression of Moses, when he says that God "opened the
   mouth of the ass." For whence would men possess the faculty of speech,
   unless God had opened their mouth at the first creation of the world?
   Whence comes it that magpies and parrots imitate the human voice,
   unless it were the will of God to manifest in them a specimen of a
   certain extraordinary power? Who is there, then, who shall now impose a
   law upon the Maker of the world, to prevent Him from adapting the mouth
   of a beast to the utterance of words? Unless perhaps they would suppose
   Him to be bound irrevocably, because He has once appointed a certain
   order in nature, to abstain from displaying His power by miracles. If
   the ass had been changed into a man, we should have been bound to
   reverence this proof of God's incomprehensible power; [149] now, when
   we are told that merely a few words were drawn from it without
   intelligence or judgment, as if a sound of any kind were diffused
   through the air, shall the miracle be regarded as a fable? Moreover, if
   unclean spirits utter words in spectral illusions, why shall God be
   unable to endow mute tongues with the faculty of speech? Let us, then,
   learn to reverence with becoming humility the sentence which God
   executed on the false prophet. He might have chastised him directly by
   the words of the Angel; but, because the reproof would not have been
   sufficiently severe if unattended by gross ignominy, He ordained that a
   beast should instruct him. The voice of the Angel was, indeed, added
   afterwards; but, since he had been so unteachable, he is treated
   according to his desert, when, after having made some proficiency in
   the school of the ass, he begins to listen to God. And, further, the
   ass convicts him of being dull, and deluded in mind in this respect,
   that he was not aroused by this unusual circumstance. For she says that
   she had never before been refractory. If, therefore, there had been any
   spark of apprehension in the wretched man, he ought to have reflected
   as to what was the meaning of this novel proceeding and sudden change.
   Thus was he awakened from his lethargy, in order that he might listen
   more attentively to what the Angel afterwards spoke.

   31. Then the Lord opened the eyes of Balaam. This passage teaches us,
   that whatever be the acuteness of our senses, it is not only implanted
   in us by God, but also either sustained or extinguished by His secret
   inspiration. Balaam's eyes are opened; consequently there was a veil
   before them previously, which prevented him from seeing what was
   manifest. Thus God at His pleasure makes dull the senses of those who
   seem to themselves to be very acute; since perception is His special
   gift.

   By this example we are shewn as in a mirror how hypocrites fear God,
   viz., when they are influenced by His presence; for as soon as they can
   withdraw themselves, they revel like fugitive slaves. Balaam saw the
   angel threatening him with a drawn sword, and he hung down his head,
   and adored; that is to say, because the vengeance of God was impending.
   But this fear by no means induced him to true correction of himself, he
   confesses, indeed, that he had sinned, and puts forth some fruit of
   repentance in that he is ready to return home; but he betrays a servile
   and compulsory fear, which only trembles at the thought of punishment.
   "I knew not (he says) that thou stoodest in the way." Unless,
   therefore, the Angel had been armed for his punishment, he was
   proceeding in security, as if impunity were conceded to him. Another
   expression also discovers his craft and perfidiousness, he is ready to
   return, if his proceeding should displease God; as if he had not known
   before that it was by no means pleasing to God. This, then, is a
   ridiculous condition, as if he were in doubt on a point which was
   abundantly clear. If he really feared God, and in pure sincerity of
   heart, he ought at once to have renounced an expedition which was
   wicked in itself, and improperly undertaken. For what avail was it to
   say, "I have sinned," if he thinks that he can prosecute the journey he
   had begun in opposition to God? Let us, therefore, learn, when God's
   will is positively known, to have recourse to no crooked subterfuges,
   whereby we may delay to perform it.

   When the Angel says: Unless the ass had turned aside, that he should
   have slain Balaam without injuring her, he intimates not only that, in
   accordance with God's justice and loving-kindness, he would have spared
   the harmless animal, but that by the very sagacity of the beast, -- as
   though she had deprecated God's anger, -- the life of her master, who
   was else unworthy of mercy, had been redeemed.

   35. And the angel of the Lord said unto Balaam. Again this wicked man
   is ironically permitted to do what could not be carried out without
   sin. But, as I have said before, he was so conscious of his ungodly
   covetousness, that he knowingly and wilfully deceived himself, instead
   of being deceived. At the same time, we must observe that, as Paul
   calls God's wisdom "manifold," (Ephesians 3:10,) so His will is
   declared in various ways, as if He were inconsistent with Himself,
   though it always actually remains the same. Certain it is, that it was
   a mere pretense of Balaam, that he went at the command or permission of
   God. Nevertheless, this answer was given him, "Go," etc. God, indeed,
   cast derision on the pertinacious folly of this wicked man, and did not
   approve as proper that which, as far as words went, He permitted;
   meanwhile, these two things are consistent with each other, that God
   did not approve what He condemned, and yet chose that it should be
   done. For, even when He executes His purpose by means of wicked men, He
   does not prescribe to them that they are to act thus. He willed to
   require punishment of Solomon by the hands of Jeroboam, and that the
   impiety of the house of Ahab should have vengeance inflicted upon it by
   Jehu; and still it was not right of Jeroboam to upset what God had
   declared, i.e., that the posterity of David should continue upon the
   throne; and Jehu also, although he had been anointed by the Prophet,
   still was guilty of a criminal act in seizing the kingdom: inasmuch as
   nothing but ambition impelled him to it. As far as relates to the
   history before us, it was His will to prove by the mouth of Balaam how
   effectual and unchangeable was His determination as to the adoption of
   the people, whereby His truth and faithfulness might be more
   conspicuously shewn forth. Nevertheless, Balaam sinned, in that he was
   attracted, like a hound, by the scent of gain, to sell his curses for
   money.

   36. And whenBalak heard that Balaam was come. This passage admirably
   represents to us the spirit of all those who are devoted to their
   various superstitions without a sincere fear of God. They are cringing
   to their false prophets; they meanly flatter them, and hardly stop
   short of worshipping them, so that nothing more obsequious can be
   imagined; yet they inwardly cherish pride, which breaks out when they
   by no means expect, it. The king goes forth to meet the prophet, and to
   pay due honors to himself and his office. It is a great condescension;
   for it is equivalent to laying his crown and sceptre at his feet: but
   his dissimulation soon discovers itself, when, expostulating with
   Balaam, he boasts of his power and riches, wherewith he was able to
   reward him. Now this is precisely as if he should make the prophetical
   office subservient to money, and claim the dominion over its
   revelations by means of his wealth. However great, then, may be the
   servility with which superstitious persons flatter their idols and
   priests, still they never lay aside their proud spirits. Such zeal we
   may see in the Papists, who are as prodigal as possible of the
   reverence which they parade towards their prelates and monks; but on
   this condition, that they will be, on their part, complacent to their
   lusts. If, therefore, a priest, (sacrificus) will not gratify his
   worshippers, they inveigh against him with as much bitterness as if he
   were any swine-herd.

   The answer of Balaam at first sight breathes nothing but piety: "I have
   come, (he says,) but I must needs speak as God shall command." Whereby
   he signifies, that, as far as civility required, and inasmuch as
   depended upon himself, he would have complied with the wishes of the
   king; but that, in regard to his office as a prophet, he was not at
   liberty to do this, inasmuch as he would disregard the favor of all
   mankind, in order that he might obey the commands of God alone.

   39. And Balaam went with Balak. Moses proceeds to relate how honorably
   and sumptuously Balaam was received. And first, he records that he was
   taken to the city of Huzoth; [150] which some would understand as a
   proper name, others as a noun appellative. In whichever way you take
   it, it denotes the extent of the city, which was divided into various
   streets. Secondly, Moses tells us that an abundance of animals were
   slain in preparation for the feast, and that guests were invited to
   banquet with Balaam himself. [151] The object of all this is, that
   Balaam was enticed by blandishments, in order that he might be ashamed
   to refuse anything to so munificent a king, by whom he had been treated
   not merely in a friendly, but in a liberal manner; just as if Balaam
   stood in the place of God, or as if the grace of God Himself were
   marketable. At length Moses adds that Balaam was brought up into the
   high places of Baal, that from this elevation he might more
   conveniently see the camp of the people. Moses, however, says that he
   only saw the extreme part of the camp; because the whole country was
   mountainous, and the view was obstructed by distance; still, in my
   opinion, the sanctity of the spot was the reason why it was chosen by
   Balak. He, therefore, brought Balaam to a temple, as it were, in order
   the more to conciliate God's favor. Hence, too, it is apparent that
   this impostor had no fixed or solid views with regard to the service of
   God, but that he worshipped idols promiscuously amongst the heathen,
   either because he was involved in the same superstitions, or because he
   made no difficulty in complying with any customs or rites, in order to
   curry favor. For there have always been [152] trimmers in the world,
   who for flattery's sake have corrupted religion by various devices, and
   have mingled heaven with earth.

   Numbers 23

   Numbers 23:1-30

   1. And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare
   me here seven oxen and seven rams.

   1. Et dixit Balaam ad Balac, AEdifica mihi hic septem altaria, appara
   quoque mihi hic septem juvencos, et septem arietes.

   2. And Balak did as Balaam had spoken: and Balak and Balaam offered on
   every altar a bullock and a ram.

   2. Fecitque Balac quemadmodum dixerat Balaam, et obtulit Balac et
   Balaam juvencum et arietem in altari.

   3. And Balaam said unto Balak, Stand by thy burnt-offering, and I will
   go; peradventure the Lord will come to meet me; and whatsoever he
   sheweth me I will tell thee. And he went to an high place.

   3. Tunc dixit Balaam ipsi Balac, Consiste juxta holocaustum tuum, et
   ibo si forte occurrat Jehova obviam mihi, et quicquid ostenderit mihi
   narrabo tibi. Abiit itaque in excelsum.

   4. And God met Balaam: and he said unto him, I have prepared seven
   altars, and I have offered upon every altar a bullock and a ram.

   4. Et occurrit Deus ipsi Balaam, dixitque illi, Septem altaria
   disposui, et obtuli juvencum in quolibet altari.

   5. And the Lord put a word in Balaam's mouth, and said, Return unto
   Balak, and thus thou shalt speak.

   5. Posuit autem Jehova verbum in ore Balaam, dixitque illi, Revertere
   ad Balac, et sic loqueris.

   6. And he returned unto him, and, Io, he stood by his burnt sacrifice,
   he and all the princes of Moab.

   6. Et reversus est ad eum, et ecce, stabat juxta holocaustum suum, ipse
   et omnes principes Moab.

   7. And he took up his parable, and said, Balak the king of Moab hath
   brought me from Aram, out of the mountains of the east, saying, Come,
   curse me Jacob; and come, defy Israel.

   7. Assumpsitque parabolam suam, ac dixit, De Aram adduxit me Balac rex
   Moab, de montibus Orientis, dicendo, Veni, maledic mihi Jacob, et vent,
   detestare Israelem.

   8. How shall I curse, whom God hath not cursed? or how shall I defy,
   whom the Lord hath not defied?

   8. Cur maledicam, et non maledixit Deus? et cur detestabor eum quem non
   detestatus est Jehova?

   9. For from the top of the rocks I see him, and from the hills I behold
   him: lo, the people shall dwell alone, and shall not be reckoned among
   the nations.

   9. Siquidem de vertice petrarum videbo eum, et de collibus intuebor
   illum: ecce, populus confidenter habitabit, et inter gentes non
   reputabitur.

   10. Who can count the dust of Jacob, and the number of the fourth part
   of Israel? Let me die the death of the righteous, and let my last end
   be like his!

   10. Quis numerabit pulverem in Jacob, ac numerabit quartam partem
   Israelis? Moriatur anima mea morte rectorum, et sit novissimum meum
   sieut ipsius.

   11. And Balak said unto Balaam, What hast thou done unto me? I took
   thee to curse mine enemies, and, behold, thou hast blessed them
   altogether.

   11. Tunc dixit Balac ad Balaam, Quid fecisti mihi; ut malediceres
   inimicis meis, sumpsi to, et ecce, benedixisti benedicendo.

   12. And he answered and said, Must I not take heed to speak that which
   the Lord hath put in my mouth?

   12. Qui respondens dixit, Nonne quod posuerit Jehova in ore meo, id
   observabo ad loquendum?

   13. And Balak said unto him, Come, I pray thee, with me unto another
   place, from whence thou mayest see them: thou shalt see but the utmost
   part of them, and shalt not see them all; and curse me them from
   thence.

   13. Tunc dixit ad cum Balac: Veni obsecro mecum ad alterum locum, unde
   videas illum (tantummodo extremum ejus vidisti, et totum ipsum non
   vidisti) et ei maledic mihi inde.

   14. And he brought him into the field of Zophim, to the top of Pisgah,
   and built seven altars, and offered a bullock and a ram on every altar.

   14. Et tulit eum in locum sublimem, in verticem Pisgah: aedificavitque
   septem altaria et obtulit juvencum et arietem in altari.

   15. And he said unto Balak, Stand here by thy burnt-offering, while I
   meet the Lord yonder.

   15. Dixit autem ad Balac, Consiste hic juxta holocaustum tuum, et ego
   occurram illic.

   16. And the Lord met Balaam, and put a word in his mouth, and said, Go
   again unto Balak, and say thus.

   16. Occurtit vero Jehova ipsi Balaam, et posuit verbum in ore ejus,
   dixitque, Revertere ad Balac, et sic loqueris.

   17. And when he came to him, behold, he stood by his burnt-offering,
   and the princes of Moab with him. And Balak said unto him, What hath
   the Lord spoken?

   17. Venit itaque ad eum, et ecce, ille stabat juxta holocaustum suum,
   et principes Moab cum illo: cui dixit Balac, Quid loquutus est Jehova?

   18. And he took up his parable, and said, Rise up, Balak, and hear;
   hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor.

   18. Tunc assumpsit parabolam suam, et dixit, Surge Balac, et audi,
   ausculta verba mea, fili Sippor.

   19. God is not a man, that he should lie; neither the son of man, that
   he should repent: hath he said, and shall he not do it? or hath he
   spoken, and shall he not make it good?

   19. Non est homo Deus, ut mentiatur, et filius hominis, ut poeniteat
   eum: ipsc dixit, et non faciet? Loquutus est, et non praestabit illud?

   20. Behold, I have received commandment to bless: and he hath blessed;
   and I cannot reverse it.

   20. Ecce ut benedicerem accepi: et benedixit benedictione, et non
   revocabo eam.

   21. He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen
   perverseness in Israel: the Lord his God is with him, and the shout of
   a king is among them.

   21. Non aspexit iniquitatem in Jacob, nec vidit violentiam in Israel.
   Jehova Deus ejus est cum eo, et clangor regis in eo.

   22. God brought them out of Egypt: he hath as it were the strength of
   an unicorn.

   22. Deus eduxit eos ex AEgypto: sicut robur unicornis est el.

   23. Surely there is no enchantment against Jacob, neither is there any
   divination against Israel: according to this time it shall be said of
   Jacob and of Israel, What hath God wrought!

   23. Non est augurium in Jacob, nec est divinatio in Israel: secundum
   hoc tempus dicetur de Jacob, et Israele, Quid operatus est Deus?

   24. Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion, and lift up
   himself as a young lion: he shall not lie down until he eat of the
   prey, and drink the blood of the slain.

   24. En populus tanquam leo surget, et tanquam leunculus elevabitur: non
   accubabit donec comederit praedam, et sanguinem occisorum biberit.

   25. And Balak said unto Balaam,: Neither curse them at all, nor bless
   them at all.

   25. Dixit autem Balac ad Balaam Neque maledicas ei, neque benedicas.

   26. But Balaam answered and said unto Balak, Told not I thee, saying,
   All that the Lord speaketh, that I must do?

   26. Cui respondit Balaam, dicens; Annon dixi tibi, quicquid dixerit
   Jehova id faciam?

   27. And Balak said unto Balaam, Come, I pray thee, I will bring thee
   unto another place; peradventure it will please God that thou mayest
   curse me them from thence.

   27. Tunc dixit Balac ad Balaam, Veni agedum, ducam te ad locum alium,
   si forte inde placebit Deo ut maledicas ei mihi.

   28. And Balak brought Balaam unto the top of Peor, that looketh toward
   Jeshimon.

   28. Sumpsit ergo Balac ipsum Balaam in verticem Peor qui respicit
   versus desertum (vel, Jesimon.)

   29. And Balaam said unto Balak, Build me here seven altars, and prepare
   me here seven bullocks and seven rams.

   29. Dixit autem Balaam ad Balac, AEdifica mihi hic septem altaria, et
   appara mihi hic septem juvencos, et septem arietes.

   30. And Balak did as Balaam had said, and offered a bullock and a ram
   on every altar.

   30. Fecit itaque Balac quemadmodum dixerat Balaam, et obtulit juvencum
   et arietem in unoquoque altari.


   1. Build me here seven altars. We more positively conclude from hence
   that this degenerate prophet had been by no means wont to prophesy in
   accordance with pure revelations from God, but that the art of
   divination, in which he boasted, had some affinity to magical
   exorcisms, and was infected with many errors and deceptions. Still this
   did not prevent him from being sometimes a true prophet by the
   inspiration of God's Spirit; because, as has been already said, whilst
   the world was plunged in darkness, it was God's will that some little
   sparks of light should still shine, in order to render even the most
   ignorant inexcusable. Since, therefore, Balaam was only endowed with a
   special gift, he borrowed devices in various directions, which savored
   of nothing but the illusions of the devil, and were utterly foreign to
   the true and legitimate method of consulting (God.) Hence came the
   seven victims and the seven altars; for, although God, by consecrating
   the seventh day unto Himself, as also in the seven lamps, and other
   things, indicated that there was something of perfection in that
   number; nevertheless, afterwards, many strange superstitions were
   invented, and under this pretense Satan cunningly deluded wretched men,
   by persuading them that secret virtues were contained in this number
   seven. This frivolous subtlety prevailed also among profane writers, so
   that they sought the confirmation of the error throughout all nature.
   Thus they allege the seven planets, as many Pleiades, the
   Septemtriones, [153] and as many circles or zones; and again, that
   infants do not come into the world alive till the seventh month. Many
   such things they heap together in order to prove that some hidden
   mystery is implied in the number seven. This contagion reached the
   Christians also: for on this point the ancients [154] sometimes
   philosophize too refinedly, and have in general preferred to corrupt
   (Scripture) rather than not to restrict the gifts of the Spirit to this
   number, and to establish the sevenfold grace of the Holy Ghost. It is
   plain that Balaam was infected by this fanciful notion, when he
   endeavours to draw down God by seven altars, and twice seven
   sacrifices. Let us, however, learn from Balak's prompt compliance, that
   the superstitious neither spare expense, nor refuse anything which is
   demanded by the masters of their errors. Wherefore we must beware lest
   we be rashly credulous; whilst at the same time we take care lest, when
   it is clear what we ought to do, we should be withheld by discreditable
   supineness, when unbelievers hasten so eagerly and speedily to their
   own destruction.

   3. And Balaam said unto Balak. In this respect, also, he imitates the
   true servants of God: for he seeks retirement, because God has almost
   always appeared unto His servants when they have been separated from
   the company of men. You would say that he was another Moses, when he
   exhorts the king to persevering prayer, and, in order that he may be
   more earnest in supplication, bids him remain perfectly still by the
   altars. Meanwhile he withdraws himself from the crowd, and the eyes of
   the witnesses, so that he may be more ready to receive the revelation.
   Since, however, there was no sincerity in him, we may probably
   conclude, that in vain ostentation he imitated the servants of God,
   that, like one of God's councillors, he might bring forth the secrets
   from the shrines of heaven. I know not why some render the word sphy,
   shephi, alone, others, sad; [155] it is more suitable to take it for a
   high place; which other similar passages confirm. The impostor,
   therefore, retired into a higher place, or summit, in order that he
   might come forth from thence more surely established as a prophet by
   his familiar intercourse with God.

   4. And God met Balaam. It is wonderful that God should have determined
   to have anything in common with the pollutions of Balaam; since there
   is no communion between light and darkness, and He detests all
   association with demons; but, however hateful to God the impiety of
   Balaam was, this did not prevent Him from making use of him in this
   particular act. This meeting him, then, was by no means a proof of His
   favor, as if he approved of the seven altars, and sanctioned these
   superstitions; but as He well knows how to apply corrupt instruments to
   His use, so by the mouth of this false prophet, He promulgated the
   covenant, which He had made with Abraham, to foreign and heathen
   nations.

   In truth, he boasts of his seven altars, as if he had duly propitiated
   God. Thus do hypocrites arrogantly trust that they deserve well of God,
   when they do but provoke His anger. God, however, passes over this
   corrupt worship, and proceeds with what He had determined; for He sends
   Balaam to be a proclaimer and witness of the sureness of His grace
   towards His chosen people. He supplies, indeed, His servants with what
   they speak, and controls their tongues; for neither would they be
   sufficient to think anything, unless the ability were bestowed by Him;
   and no one can say that Jesus is the Lord, but by the Holy Ghost. Still
   the holy Prophets were in suchwise organs of the Spirit, that they gave
   forth from the heart the treasures which God had deposited with them.
   In this view, Jeremiah says that he "did eat the words of God,"
   (Jeremiah 15:16;) and Ezekiel, that he ate the roll on which his
   prophecies were written. (Ezekiel 3:1.) For we must not conceive an
   inspiration (enthousiasmos) such as that by which the heathens supposed
   their diviners to be carried away, so that the heavenly afflatus
   transported them, or threw them into ecstasies; but rather did that
   take place in them, which David declares of himself: "I believed,
   therefore have I spoken," (Psalm 116:10:) and God illuminated their
   senses before He guided their tongues. The case of Balaam was
   different, whose mind was alienated while he delivered the words which
   were put into his mouth. [156]

   7. And he took up his parable and said. The word msl, mashal, signifies
   all weighty and notable sayings, especially when expressed in exalted
   language. The meaning, therefore, is, that Balaam began to speak
   eloquently, and in no ordinary strain. Nor can it be doubted but that
   he aroused Balak's attention by this grandeur of language through God's
   secret influence; that the wretched man might acknowledge that Balaam
   now spoke in no mortal fashion, but that there was something of divine
   inspiration in his words, so that his mind might be the more deeply
   affected by the revelation. The sum of what he said was to this effect,
   that there was not merely perversity and folly in Balak's design to
   curse the people, but that whatever he attempted would be vain and
   useless, since he was fighting against God. At the same time, he
   renounces for himself that power, which Balak was persuaded that he
   eminently possessed: for Moses has already recorded the words of Balak
   before spoken, "I know that he whom thou cursest is cursed," as if the
   power of God were transferred to him, so that he might exercise it
   according to his will. But what was this, but to depose God from His
   supremacy? Consequently this abominable imagination is refuted by the
   mouth of Balaam, when he attributes the right of blessing to God alone.
   "How (he says) should I curse except according to God's command?" not
   that God always restrains the wicked from declaring what is opposed to
   His truth: for we know that they often prate at random, vomit forth
   their blasphemies by the mouthful, obscure the light by their
   falsehoods, and endeavor, as far as in them lies, to overthrow the
   faithfulness of God. But inasmuch as Balaam was compelled to play a
   different part, viz., to proclaim the revelation suggested to him by
   God, he confesses that his tongue was tied, so that he could not utter
   a single syllable against God's command.

   Since mention is made of Syria, some have supposed that Balaam was
   fetched from Mesopotamia; and some color was given to this mistake,
   because the art of divination had its rise amongst the Chaldeans. But,
   as has been said before, it is not credible that the fame of the man
   should have extended so far; and again, in the short time during which
   the people remained there, how could an embassy have been twice sent to
   a distant country? for they would have occupied at least six months.
   Besides, we shall soon see that he was slain among the Midianites. But
   it is very probable that the country was included under the name of
   Aram or Syria, which even profane authors describe as contiguous to
   Arabia, towards the Red Sea. Now, since, in reference to the land of
   Moab, Midian was to the eastward, and, moreover, was high and
   mountainous, it is rightly added that he was called "from the mountains
   of the east;" and thus does he designate a place well known to the
   Moabites, on account of its neighborhood to them.

   9 For from the top of the rocks I see him. Unless I am mistaken, the
   meaning is that, although he only beheld the people from afar, so that
   he could not accurately perceive their power from so high and distant a
   spot, still they portended to him something great and formidable. A
   closer view generally intimidates men; besides, a body of twenty
   thousand men then dazzles our sight, as if the number were five times
   as great: whilst the real extent of a thing is also more accurately
   ascertained. But Balaam declares, in the spirit of prophecy, that he
   sees far more in the people of God than their distance from him would
   allow; for, posted as he was on a high eminence, he would have only
   belleld them as dwarfs with the ordinary vision of men. He says, that
   "the people shall dwell alone," as being by no means in want of
   external support: for lvdd, lebadad, is equivalent to solitarily or
   separately. It is said of the people, therefore, that they shall dwell
   in such a manner as to be content with their own condition, neither
   desiring the wealth or power of others, nor seeking their aid. The fact
   that the people had recourse at one time to the Egyptians, at another
   to the Assyrians, and entangled themselves in improper alliances, is
   not repugnant to this prophecy, in which the question is not as to the
   virtue of the people, but only as to the blessing of God, which is
   again celebrated in the same words in Deuteronomy 33:28

   What follows, that "they shall not be reckoned among the nations," must
   not be understood in depreciation of them, as if it were said that they
   should be of no credit or position; but the elect people is exalted
   above all others in dignity and excellence, as though he had said that
   there should be no nation under heaven equal to or comparable with
   them. And, although there were other kingdoms more illustrious for the
   flourishing condition of their people, and superior both in the number
   of their inhabitants, and in all kinds of prosperity, still this people
   never forfeited their pre-eminence, since they were distinguished, not
   so much by wealth and external endowments, as by the adoption of God.
   Thus, Mount Sion is called noble above all other mountains, because God
   had there chosen to make His abode. Others explain it that the people
   should be alone, so as not to be brought into comparison with the
   Gentiles, inasmuch as its religion should be separate from the whole
   world, and unmingled with heathen corruptions. The exposition which I
   have given is, however, more simple.

   10. Who can count the dust of Jacob? Hence it is plain that what Balaam
   was to say was suggested to him by God, since he quotes the words of
   God's solemn promise, wherein the seed of Abraham is compared to the
   dust of the earth. Still, we must bear in mind what I have just
   adverted to, that, although that multitude was reduced to a small
   number by the sin of the people, nevertheless this was not declared in
   vain, inasmuch as that little body at length expanded itself so as to
   fill the whole world. Speaking by hyperbole, then, he says that their
   offspring would be infinite, since the fourth part will be almost
   innumerable. His aspiration at the conclusion is more emphatic than a
   simple affirmation. "I would (he says) that I might share with them
   their last end!" [157] For, in the first place, every one longs for
   what is most for his good; and again, Balaam confesses himself unworthy
   to be reckoned among the elect people of God. Hence it might be easily
   inferred how foolishly Balak trusted to his curse. Further, in these
   words he refers to everlasting felicity; as much as to say that
   (Israel) would be blessed in death as in life. At the same time he is a
   witness to our future immortality; not that he had reflected in himself
   wherefore the death of the righteous would be desirable, but God
   extorted this confession from an unholy man, so that, either
   unwillingly or thoughtlessly, he exclaimed that God so persevered in
   the extension of His paternal favor towards His people, that He did not
   cease to be gracious to them even in their death. Hence it follows,
   that the grace of God extends beyond the bounds of this perishing life.
   Wherefore this declaration contains a remarkable testimony to our
   future immortality. For although Balaam, perhaps, did not thoroughly
   consider what he desired, still, there is no doubt but that he truly
   professed that he wished it for himself. Nevertheless, as hypocrites
   are wont to do, he did but conceive an evanescent wish, for it was in
   no real seriousness that he sought what he was convinced was best.
   [158]

   The Israelites are called righteous (recti,) as also in other places,
   not on account of their own righteousness, but in accordance with God's
   good pleasure, who had deigned to separate them from the unclean
   nations.

   11. And Balak said unto Balaam. The proud man again reproaches the
   false prophet, as if he had fairly purchased of him the right of
   prophecy. [159] Behold how the reprobate seek God by crooked paths, and
   desire to have nothing to do with Him, unless He yields to their
   improper wishes -- in a word, unless they render Him submissive to
   them. Balaam, therefore, is compelled to repress this stupid arrogance,
   by pleading God's command, and declaring that nothing more was allowed
   him than to announce what God prescribed. But we must remember that
   this was only spoken in reference to a particular act, when, as far as
   his words went, he acted the part of a true prophet, although his
   feelings were altogether on the other side.

   13. And Balac said unto him. Balak did, as almost all superstitious
   persons usually do; for, because with them nothing is certain or
   established, they are carried about from one speculation to another,
   and try now this and now that expedient. But especially do they imagine
   that there is some magical power in the sight, as if the eyes
   contributed partly to the efficacy of their incantations. It appears
   from profane writers that this was formerly a commonly received
   opinion, that the gaze of the enchanter had much effect upon his art.
   Balak, therefore, removes his sorcerer to another place, that there he
   might the better exercise his divinations. There is some ambiguity in
   the words. Some render them thus, "Come to another place, that thou
   mayest see from thence, [160] mayest see a part, and not the whole," as
   if Balak feared that the multitude itself frightened Balaam, or
   diminished the power of his incantations. Their opinion, however, is
   the more probable, who take the verb see, where it is used the second
   time, in the perfect tense, so that the sense is, "Come to a place
   where thou mayest behold them; for as yet thou hast not seen the whole,
   but only a part;" for we know how common a thing with the Hebrews is
   such an employment of one tense for another. With respect to the place
   to which Balaam was taken, it little matters whether we believe sdh
   tsphym, sedeh tzophim and phsgh pis'gah, to be nouns proper or
   appellative, since it is sufficiently clear that, if they were given to
   the place, it was on account of its position; for it is very likely
   that there was a level place upon the hill, which might justly be
   called "The hill of the spies."

   17. And when he came to him. Balak inquires what God had answered,
   although he had rejected the previous revelation. Thus do hypocrites
   profess anxious solicitude in inquiring the will of God, whilst the
   knowledge of it is intolerable to them. Therefore their extreme
   earnestness in inquiry is nothing but mere dissimulation. Besides,
   Balak hunts, as it were, for the answer of God by a distant divination,
   whereas a testimony to God's will was all the time engraven upon his
   heart. But this is the just punishment of perverse curiosity, when the
   wicked endeavor to impose a law upon God, that he may submit to their
   wishes. Balak omits nothing in regard to outward ceremonies; he humbly
   attends upon the altars for the purpose of propitiating God; but in the
   meantime he would have Him obedient to himself, and cannot endure to
   listen to Him, unless He speaks to him in flattering and deceptive
   terms.

   18. And he took up his parable and said. We have already explained the
   meaning of this expression, namely, to make use of glowing and elevated
   language, in order the more to awaken the attention of the hearer. The
   same also is the object of the preface, "Rise up, Balak, and hear;
   hearken unto me, thou son of Zippor;" for such repetitions are mostly
   emphatic, and indicate something uncommon.

   When he declares that "God cannot lie, because he is not like men," it
   is a severe kind of censure, as much as to say, "Would you make God a
   liar?" for it became requisite that the frantic eagerness of Balak
   should be repressed, and prevented from proceeding any further. Hence,
   however, a lesson of supreme utility may be extracted, namely, that men
   are altogether wrong when they form their estimate of God from their
   own disposition and habits. Still, almost all men labor under this
   mistake. For how comes it that we are so prone to waver, except because
   we weigh God's promises in our own scale? In order, therefore, that we
   may learn to lift up our minds above the world, whenever the
   faithfulness and certainty of God's word are in question, it is well
   for us to reflect how great the distance is between ourselves and God.
   Men are wont to lie, because they are fickle and changeable in their
   plans, or because sometimes they are unable to aceomplish what they
   have promised; but change of purpose arises either from levity or bad
   faith, or because we repent of what we have spoken foolishly and
   inconsiderately. But to God nothing of this sort occurs; for He is
   neither deceived, nor does He deceitfully promise anything, nor, as
   James says, is there with Him any "shadow of turning." (James 1:7.) We
   now understand to what this dissimilitude between God and men refers,
   namely, that we should not travesty God according to our own notions,
   but, in our consideration of His nature, should remember that he is
   liable to no changes, since He is far above all heavens. As to the
   meaning of the repentance of God, of which mention is often made, let
   my readers seek it elsewhere in its proper place. We must, however, at
   the same time, observe the application of the lesson; for the words
   "God is true," would have no efficacy in themselves, unless they are
   applied to their appropriate use, i.e., that we should with
   unhesitating faith acquiesce in His promises, and seriously tremble at
   His threats. For with the same object it is said that the word of God
   is pure and perfect, and is compared with gold refined seven times in
   the fire; and this also is the tendency of the conclusion, which is
   presently added: "Shall He not fulfill what He has spoken?" Balak
   desired to have the people cursed, whom God had adopted: Balaam
   declares that this is impossible, because God is unchangeable in that
   which he has decreed. In a word, he teaches us the same truth as Paul
   does, that the election of his people is "without repentance," because
   it is founded on the gratuitous liberality of God. (Romans 11:29.) If,
   then, this saying was extorted from the hireling false prophet, how
   inexcusable will be our stupidity, if our minds vary and waver in
   embracing God's word, as if He Himself were variable.

   20. Behold I have received commandment to bless. He signifies that a
   command to bless had been given him, antl a positive law laid down for
   him. For, as has been said, he was not free and independent in this
   matter; but God had bound him to exercise the prophetic office, even
   against his own will. Hence he declares that it is not in his power to
   alter the revelation, of which he is the minister and witness. But
   there is a remarkable expression introduced in the midst of his
   declaration, viz., that God himself had blessed; whereby he intimates
   that the lot of men, whether adverse or prosperous, depends on the
   authority of God alone; and that no other commission is given to the
   prophets, except to promulgate what God has appointed; as if he had
   said, It belongs to God alone to decree what the condition of men is to
   be; He has chosen me to proclaim His blessing; it is not in my power
   either to reverse or withdraw it. Now, since Balaam here sustains the
   character of a true Prophet, we may gather from his words that no other
   power of binding or loosing is given to the ministers of the Word,
   except that they should faithfully bring forward what they may have
   received from God.

   21. He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob. Some understand by 'vn, aven,
   ml, gnamal, idols, [161] which bring nothing but deadly labor and
   trouble to their worshippers; as if it were said that Israel was pure
   and untainted by such offenses, in that they duly served the one true
   God. But how will it be correct to say that God saw not idolatry in the
   people, when they had so openly fallen into it? For, although the
   golden calf was only made on one occasion, still their manifold and
   almost constant rebellions were such as to forbid these wicked and
   perverse men from being thus absolved. Since, however, these two words
   in connection signify all sorts of iniquities, which tend to men's
   hurt, or to the infliction of harm and loss, a more proper meaning will
   be, that such iniquity is not seen in Jacob as to include him with the
   nations that are given to violence and crime. Nevertheless, even if we
   take it thus, the former question still arises; for we know that the
   Israelites were scarcely better than the worst of mankind. Some reply
   feebly, that it was not seen, because God did not impute it; but, in my
   opinion, nothing else is meant by these words but that the people were
   pleasing to God, because He had sanctified them. If any object, that
   they were not therefore any the more just or innocent, the answer is
   easy -- that it is not here declared what they were, but only God's
   grace is magnified, who deigned to exalt them as a holy nation. In this
   way Jerusalem was the holy city and the royal abode of God, though it
   was a den of thieves. On this ground Paul says that the children of
   Abraham were "holy branches," (Romans 11:16,) because they sprang from
   a holy root. In the same sense they are everywhere called God's
   Children, however degenerate they might be. God, therefore, is said to
   have seen no iniquity in them, with reference to His adoption; not that
   they were worthy of such exalted praise, as if a distinction were drawn
   between them and the other nations -- not on account of their deserts,
   but from the mere good pleasure of God. Thus Paul elsewhere, after he
   has compared them with the Gentiles, and has shewn that they are their
   superiors in no respect, at length adds, "What advantage then hath the
   Jew? or what profit is there of circumcision? Much (he says) every way;
   "and adduces a mark of distinction which does not proceed from
   themselves, [162] (Romans 3:1.) In a word, because it had pleased God
   to choose that people, He rather manifested His love towards Himself
   and His own grace, than towards their life and conduct.

   Others take this passage otherwise, viz., that God did not behold
   iniquity, nor see perverseness in Jacob, because He was not willing
   that he should be unrighteously grieved or afflicted; as if it were
   said, If any one should wish unjustly to injure this people, God will
   permit no violence or injustice to be done to them, but will rather
   defend them as their shield. But if this sense be preferred, I should
   rather be disposed to take the vero indefinitely, as if it were said,
   Perverseness shall not be seen in Jacob; for when the Hebrews use the
   verb without a nominative, they extend the matter in question into a
   general proposition, and then the verb in the active voice may be
   suitably resolved into the passive. And thus the context will run
   better, since it is added immediately afterwards, "The Lord his God is
   with him," whereby the reason seems to be given why perverseness
   (molestia) should not be seen against Jacob, viz., because God would be
   at hand to render him aid. For we know that His infinite power suffices
   to defend the safety of His Church, so that not even the gates of hell
   should prevail against it.

   What follows directly afterwards, "The shout or the rejoicing of a king
   is among them," I understand to be that God will always give them cause
   for triumph; for the word which the old interpreter elsewhere renders
   rejoicing (jubilationem,) seems here to be used for songs of rejoicing;
   but, since it also signifies the sound of a trumpet, it will not be
   inappropriate to take it as that the people shall be terrible to their
   enemies, because they shall boldly rush forward, or go down to the
   battle, as if God sounded the trumpet.

   22. God brouqht them out of Egypt. He assigns a reason for their
   constant success, i.e., because God has once redeemed this people, He
   will not forsake the work which He has begun. The argument is drawn
   from the continued course of God's blessings; for, since they flow from
   an inexhaustible fountain, their progress is incessant. This, however,
   specially refers to the state of the Church, for He will never cease to
   be gracious to His children, until He has led them to the very end of
   their course. Rightly, therefore, does Balaam conclude that, because
   God has once redeemed His people, He will be the perpetual guardian of
   their welfare. He afterwards teaches that the power wherewith God
   defends His people shall be invincible, for this is the meaning of the
   similitude of the unicorn.

   23. Surely there is no enchantment. This passage is commonly expounded
   as an encomium on the people, because they are not given to
   enchantments and magical superstitions, as God also had strictly
   enjoined upon them in His law that they should not pollute themselves
   by such defilements. Others thus explain it, The Israelites shall not
   want enchanters, because by the Urim and Thummim, or by the Prophets,
   God would reveal to them whatever should be profitable for them. Their
   opinion is more correct who thus interpret it, No enchantment and no
   divination avails against the Israelites. Let us now proceed to explain
   this more clearly. Balaam, in my judgment, confesses that there is no
   room for His enchantments, or that his customary arts fail him now,
   because their efficacy and power cannot affect the Israelites. And this
   confession harmonizes with the words of Pharaoh's magicians, when they
   said, "This is the finger of God," (Exodus 8:19;) after they had
   pertinaciously contended, until God compelled them to yield. Thus now
   Balaam declares that the elect people were defended from on high, so
   that his divinations were ineffectual, and his enchantments vain.

   The other clause of the verse appears to me to be simply to this
   effect, that God would henceforth perform mighty works for the defense
   of His people which should be related with admiration. The translation
   which some give is constrained and far-fetched, "As at this time it
   shall be said, What has God wrought in Israel?" for Balaam rather would
   say, that great should be the progress of God's grace, the beginnings
   only of which then appeared; and in short, he declares that henceforth
   memorable should be the performances of God in behalf of His people,
   which should supply abundant subjects for history.

   24. Behold, the people shall rise up as a great lion. This comparison
   is not in every respect accurate; for it does not signify that the
   Israelites should be cruel or rapacious, but merely bold and strong,
   and prompt in their resistance if any should provoke them. In the next
   chapter, it will occur again with a slight change in the words. What
   Balaam here predicates generally of the whole people, is applied in the
   blessings of Jacob to the tribe of Judah alone, (Genesis 49:9,) because
   it especially excelled in bravery. The sum is, that however the people
   of Israel might be attacked on every side, it should be endued with
   invincible fortitude, to overcome all assaults, or to repel them
   vigorously. Let us, finally, remember that this courage, wherewith
   Israel was to defend itself against all its enemies, was counted
   amongst the gifts of God; as: if Balaam had said that they should be
   preserved by the help of God.

   25. And Balak said unto Balaam. Here we may behold as in a mirror how
   wretchedly unbelievers are driven to and fro, so as to alternate
   between vain hopes and fears, though by their changes of purpose they
   are still brought back to the same errors, as if their blind passion
   led them through a labyrinth. When Balak sees that he is deceived in
   his opinion, he seeks at least that the hireling prophet should neither
   profit nor injure. This, however, is exactly as if he would have God to
   lie idle; but presently he recovers his spirits, and endeavors to
   repurchase the curse, which in his penitence he had abandoned. For this
   cause he drags Balaam to another place, although he had already
   discovered that this was in vain. But thus pertinaciously do
   unbelievers prosecute their wicked efforts: whilst, at the same time,
   the disquietude which agitates them with doubts is the just reward of
   their temerity.

   26. But Balaam answered and said. The mercenary prophet here confesses
   that he has no more power of himself to be silent than to speak. Nor is
   there any doubt but that he would excuse himself with servility to the
   proud king, to whom he would willingly have sold himself; as if, in his
   desire to avert the odium and blame from himself, he would state that
   he was carried away against his will by the Divine afflatus. At the
   same time he throws back the blame on Balak himself, who, though warned
   in time, had still foolishly sent to fetch him. The rest I have already
   expounded.

   Numbers 24

   Numbers 24:1-25

   1. And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord to bless Israel, he
   went not, as at other times, to seek for enchantments, but he set his
   face toward the wilderness.

   1. Quum autem videret Balaam qued placeret Jehovae, ut benediceret
   Israeli, non abiit sicut semel et iterum in occursum auguriorum: sed
   posuit versus desertum faciem suam.

   2. And Balaam lifted up his eyes, and he saw Israel abiding in his
   tents according to their tribes; and the Spirit of God came upon him.

   2. Ac quum elevasset oculos suos, vidit Israelem dispositum per tribus
   suas: fuitque super eum Spiritus Dei.

   3. And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beer hath
   said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said:

   3. Tunc assumpsit parabolam suam, et ait, Dicit Balaam filius Beor,
   dicit vir reconditus oculo.

   4. He hath said, which heard the words of God, which saw the vision of
   the Almighty, falling into a trance, but having his eyes open:

   4, Dicit qui audivit eloquia Dei, qui visionem Omnipotentis vidit, qui
   cadit et aperiuntur oeuli ejus.

   5. How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob! and thy tabernacles, O Israel!

   5. Quam pulchra tabernacula tua Jacob, habitacula tua Israel!

   6. As the valleys are they spread forth, as gardens by the river's
   side, as the trees of lign-aloes, which the Lord hath planted, and as
   cedar-trees beside the waters.

   6. Sicut valles diffusae, sicut horti juxta flumen, sicut arbores
   aloes, quas plantavit Jehova, sicut cedri juxta aquas.

   7. He shall pour the water out of his buckets, and his seed shall be in
   many waters; and his king shall be higher than Agag, and his kingdom
   shall be exalted.

   7. Defluet aqua e situla ejus, et semen ejus in aquis multis, et
   elevabitur rex ejus super Agag, et extolletur regnum ejus.

   8. God brought him forth out of Egypt: he hath as it were the strength
   of an unicorn: he shall eat up the nations his enemies, and shall break
   their bones, and pierce them through with his arrows.

   8. Deus eduxit eum ex AEgypto: sicut vires unicornis ei. Consumet
   gentes hostes suos, et ossa eorum conteret, et sagittis suis confodiet
   (vel, sagittas suas tinget sanguine.)

   9. He couched, he lay down as a lion, and as a great lion: who shall
   stir him up? Blessed is he that blesseth thee, and cursed is he that
   curseth thee.

   9. Incurvabit se ut accubet tanquam leo minor, et tanquam leo major:
   quis excitabit eum? Quisquis benedixerit tibi, erit benedictus: et
   quisquis maledixerit tibi; erit maledictus.

   10. And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam, and he smote his
   hands together: and Balak said unto Balaam, I called thee to curse mine
   enemies, and, behold, thou hast altogether blessed them these three
   times.

   10 Et excanduit furor Balac contra Balaam, et percussit manus suas, ac
   dixit ipsi Balaam, Ut maledicercs inimicis meis vocavi te, et ecce,
   benedixisti benedicendo jam tribus vicibus.

   11. Therefore now flee thou to thy place: I thought to promote thee
   unto great honor; but, lo, the Lord hath kept thee back from honor.

   11. Nunc ergo fuge in locum tuum: dixeram, Honorando honorabo te, et
   ecce, privavit te Jehova gloria.

   12. And Balaam said unto Balak, Spake I not also to thy messengers,
   which thou sentest unto me, saying,

   12. Cui respondit Balaam, Annon etiam nuntiis tuis quos miseras ad me
   loquutus sum, dicendo:

   13. If Balak would give me his house full of silver and gold, I cannot
   go beyond the commandment of the Lord, to do either good or bad of mine
   own mind; but what the Lord saith, that will I speak?

   13. Si dederit mihi Balac plenam domum suam argento et auro, non potero
   transgredi sermonem Jehovae, ut faciat bonum sive malum e corde meo:
   quod loquetur Jehova, illud loquar?

   14. And now, behold, I go unto my people: come therefore, and I will
   advertise thee what this people shall do to thy people in the latter
   days.

   14. Nunc itaque ecce, ego discedo ad populum meum: age, consulam tibi
   quid facturus sit populus iste populo tuo in novissimis diebus.

   15. And he took up his parable, and said, Balaam the son of Beor hath
   said, and the man whose eyes are open hath said;

   15. Tunc assumpsit parabolam suam, et dixit, Dixit Balaam filius Beor,
   dixit, inquam, vir apertum habens oculum.

   16. He hath said, which heard the words of God, and knew the knowledge
   of the most High, which saw the vision of the Almighty, falling into a
   trance, but having his eyes open.

   16. Dixit audiens eloquia Dei, et sciens scientiam Excelsi, videns
   visionem Omnipotentis: cadens, et discoopertum habens oculum.

   17. I shall see him, but not now; I shall behold him, but not nigh:
   there shall come a Star out of Jacob, and a Sceptre shall rise out of
   Israel, and shall smite the corners of Moab, and destroy all the
   children of Sheth.

   17. Video eum: sed non modo: intueor illum: sed non prope: procedet
   stella ex Jacob, et surget sceptrum ex Israele: et confodiet principes
   (vel, angulos) Moab, et destruct omnes filios Seth.

   18. And Edom shall be a possession, Seir also shall be a possession for
   his enemies: and Israel shall do valiantly.

   18. Et erit Edom possessa et possidebitur Seir ab inimicis Seir, et
   Israel faciet virtutem.

   19. Out of Jacob shall come he that shall have dominion, and shall
   destroy him that remaineth of the city.

   19. Et dominabitur ex Jacob, et perdet reliquias ex civitate.

   20. And when he looked on Amalek, he took up his parable, and said,
   Amalek was the first of the nations; but his latter end shall be that
   he perish for ever.

   20. Et quum vidisset Amalec, assumpsit parabolam suam, et dixit,
   Principium gentium Amalec, ideo novissimum ejus usque ad perditionem.

   21. And he looked on the Kenites, and took up his parable, and said,
   Strong is thy dwelling-place, and thou puttest thy nest in a rock:

   21. Viso etiam Cenaeo, assumpsit parabolam suam, et dixit, Robustum
   habitaculum tuum, et ponis in petra nidum tuum.

   22. Nevertheless the Kenite shall be wasted, until Asshur shall carry
   thee away captive.

   22. Certe expelletur Cain, usquequo Assur captivum te ducet.

   23. And he took up his parable, and said, Alas! who shall live when God
   doeth this?

   23. Assumpsit item parabolam, et dixit, Vae quis vivet quum statuerit
   istud?

   24. And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim, and shall afflict
   Asshur, and shall afflict Eber, and he also shall perish for ever.

   24. Et naves e littore Chitthim quae affligant Assur, affligent Heber,
   sed hoc quoque usque ad perditionem.

   25. And Balaam rose up, and went and returned to his place; and Balak
   also went his way.

   25. Surrexit itaque Balaam, et abiit, reversusque est in locum suum:
   atque etiam Balacabiit in viam suam.


   1. And when Balaam saw that it pleased the Lord. It is evident that
   Balaam, in order to gratify the wicked king for the sake of the reward,
   endeavored by various shifts and expedients to obtain an answer in
   accordance with his wishes. Thus do the wicked seek to propitiate God
   by delusive means, just as we soothe children by coaxing. And God for
   some time allowed him [163] to gloat upon his fallacious oracle. He
   now, however, lays closer constraint upon him, and, breaking off all
   delay, dictates an answer, which He compels him to deliver. For his
   obedience is not here praised as if, when he understood the will of
   God, he yielded voluntarily and abandoned his monstrous cupidity; but,
   because now there was no more room for subterfuge, he dared not stir
   his foot, as if God had put forth His hand to retain him in his place.

   When it is said that "the Spirit of God was upon him," [164] after he
   turned his eyes "toward the wilderness" and beheld the camp of Israel,
   how they were marshalled "according to their tribes," we must
   understand it thus: not that he was influenced by a sincere feeling of
   good-will, so that the sight itself suggested grounds for blessing; but
   that he was induced by the inspiration of the same Spirit, who
   afterwards put forth His influence in the prophecy itself. It is said,
   then, that the Spirit of God was upon him, not as if it had begun to
   inspire him at that particular moment when he cast his eyes upon the
   camp of Israel; but because it prompted him to look in that direction,
   in order that the impulse of prophecy might be stronger in him, as
   respecting a thing actually before his eyes. But after the Spirit had
   thus affected his senses, or at any rate had prepared them to be fit
   instruments for the execution of his office, it then also directed his
   tongue to prophesy; but in an extraordinary manner, so that a divine
   majesty shone forth in the sudden change, as if he were transformed
   into a new man. In a word, "the Spirit of God was upon him," shewing by
   manifest token that He was the author of his address, and that he did
   not speak of his own natural intelligence. To the same intent it is
   said that "he took up his parable," because [165] the character of his
   address was marked with unusual grandeur and magnificent brilliancy.

   3. And the man whose eyes are open, [166] hath said. This preface has
   no other object than to prove that he is a true prophet of God, and
   that he has received the blessing, which he pronounces, from divine
   revelation; and indeed his boast was true as regarded this special act,
   though it might be the case that pride and ambition impelled him thus
   to vaunt. It is, however, probable that he prefaced his prophecy in
   this way by the inspiration of the Spirit, in order to demand more
   credit for what he said. From a consideration of this purpose we may
   the better gather the meaning of his words. Balaam dignifies himself
   with titles, by which he may claim for himself the prophetic office;
   whatever, therefore, he predicates of himself, we may know to be the
   attributes of true prophets, whose marks and distinctions he borrows.
   To this end he says that he is "hidden in his eye," by which he means
   that he does not see in the ordinary manner, but that he is endued with
   the power of secret vision. Interpreters agree that stm shethum, is
   equivalent to stm sethum, which is closed or hidden. Thus some render
   it in the pluperfect tense: The man who had his eyes closed; and this
   they refer to the blindness of Balaam, since his ass saw more clearly
   than himself. Others, who perceive this gloss to be too poor, expound
   it by anti-phrasis, Whose eye was open; but, since this interpretation,
   too, is unnatural, I have no doubt but that he says his eyes were
   hidden, because in their secret vision they have more than human power.
   [167] For David makes use of the word to signify mysteries, when he
   says:

   "Thou hast manifested to me the hidden things [168] of wisdom." (Psalm
   51:6.)

   Unless, perhaps, we may prefer that he was called the man with hidden
   eyes, as despising all human things, and as one with whom there is no
   respect of persons; the former interpretation, however, is the more
   suitable. And assuredly, when he adds immediately afterwards, the
   hearer of "the words of God, which saw the vision of the Almighty," it
   must be taken expositively. To the same effect is what is added in
   conclusion: "He who falls [169] and his eyes are opened;" for the
   exposition which some give, that his mind was awake whilst he was
   asleep as regarded his body, is far-fetched; and there is a tameness in
   the opinion of those who refer it to the previous history, where it is
   recorded that, after Balaam had fallen under the ass, his eyes were
   opened to see the angel (chap. 22:31.) Comparing himself, therefore, to
   the prophets, he says that he fell down in order to receive his
   visions; for we often read that the prophets were prostrated, or lost
   their strength, and lay almost lifeless, when God revealed Himself to
   them; for thus did it please God to cast down His servants as to the
   flesh, in order to lift them up above the world, and to empty them of
   their own strength, in order to replenish them with heavenly virtue.

   5. How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob! The internal condition of
   prosperity enjoyed by the people is described by various similitudes
   akin to each other, and expressive of the same thing. He compares them
   to valleys and well-watered gardens, and then to trees which were
   rendered succulent by abundance of moisture, and finally to fields
   whose seeds imbibe fatness from the waters. The word we translate
   "valleys spread forth," some prefer to render "streams;" and the Hebrew
   word signifies both; but the course of the metaphors requires that
   valleys should be rather understood. For the same reason I have given
   the translation "aloe-trees;" for, although the word 'hlym ohelim,
   often means "tabernacles," I have no doubt but that it here refers to
   trees, so as to correspond with what follows as to the cedars. They are
   called trees "which the Lord hath planted," as surpassing the ordinary
   growth of nature in their peculiar excellency, and exhibiting something
   more noble than the effect of human labor and skill.

   In the concluding similitude the interpreters have erred, in nay
   opinion. Some translate it, "His seed (is) many waters;" others, "on
   many waters;" but [170] the literal translation which I have given runs
   far better, viz., that he is like a rich and fertile field, whose seed
   is steeped in much water.

   Thus far Balaam has been speaking of God's blessing, which shall enrich
   the people with an abundance of all good things.

   7. And his king shall be higher than Agag. He now begins to enlarge on
   their outward prosperity, viz., that the people of Israel shall be
   powerful and flourishing, and endowed with a warlike spirit to resist
   the assaults of their enemies; for it would not be sufficient that they
   should abound with all blessings, unless the ability to defend them
   should also be superadded. It is by no means a probable conjecture that
   he speaks of Saul who made prisoner of their king, Agag, in the battle
   with the Amalekites; but their opinion is the more correct one, who
   suppose that this was a name common to all the kings of that nation. It
   was, therefore, God's intention to declare the superiority of His
   chosen people to the Amalekites; nor need we be surprised that they
   should be thus brought into especial antagonism with them, not only
   because they were the constant enemies of Israel, but because their
   power was then excessively great, as we shall very soon see: "Amalek
   was the first of nations," etc. (verse 20.)

   Although for a long time afterwards, there was no king in Israel, still
   there is no absurdity in the fact that the commonwealth should be
   designated by the name of "king," and "kingdom;" especially since God
   had postponed the full accomplishment of His grace until the time of
   the establishment of the kingdom. Hence, in this prophecy, Balaam,
   however little he might have been aware of it, embraced the time of
   David; and consequently he predicted things which were only
   accomplished in Christ, on whom the adoption was founded.

   What follows has been already expounded, viz, that God, in delivering
   His people, had made it plain that He would have them remain in safety
   and perpetuity; and that He was able to bring this to pass.

   9. Blessed is he that blesseth thee. This mode of expression signifies
   that the Israelites were elected by God, on these terms, that He would
   account as conferred upon Himself whatever injury or benefit they might
   receive. Nor is there anything new in this, that God should declare
   that He would be an enemy to the enemies of His Church; and, on the
   other hand, a friend to her friends, which is a token of the high favor
   with which He regards her. Hence, however, we are taught, that whatever
   good offices are performed towards the Church, are conferred upon God
   Himself, who will recompense them faithfully: and, at the same time,
   that believers cannot be injured, without His avenging them: even as He
   says; "He that toucheth you toucheth the apple of my eye." (Zechariah
   2:8.) If any should object that Balaam himself went unrewarded,
   although he blessed the people, the reply is an easy one, that he was
   unworthy of any praise, who was by no means disposed in the people's
   favor of his own accord, and out of pure and generous feeling; but who
   was forcibly drawn in a direction whither he was unwilling to go.
   Meanwhile, this point remains unshaken, that whosoever have contributed
   their labors for the Chureh's welfare, and have been her faithful
   helpers, shall be sure partakers of the blessing which is here
   promised.

   10. And Balak's anger was kindled against Balaam. Inasmuch as the
   obstinacy of the wicked is not overcome, so that they should submit
   themselves to God, when He would bring their lusts under the yoke, it
   must needs be that, when they are still further pressed, they are
   carried away into passion. Thus now, Balak, after murmurings and
   expostulations, bursts forth into impetuous wrath, and rejects, and
   drives away with reproaches from his presence Balaam, whom he had
   hitherto been endeavoring to cajole. For, when he smites his hands
   together, it is because he can no longer restrain himself. He is
   especially indignant, because Balaam had not hesitated freely and
   openly to bear witness to the blessing of the children of Israel,
   against whom he was so full of hatred. For nothing is more galling to
   kings than when they see private individuals regarding their presence
   at least without alarm. Since he determines to give no reward to the
   untoward and ill-starred prophet, he throws the blame upon God, lest he
   should himself incur discredit from this, as if he were illiberal. And,
   indeed, what he says is true, that God had kept back Balaam from honor;
   yet impiously, and, as it were, reproachfully, does he lay the blame
   upon God, and, in fact, accuses Him of being the cause of the
   non-fulfillment of his promise.

   12. And Balaam said unto Balak. Balaam speaks the truth, indeed, yet in
   a bad spirit, as we have seen: for he excuses himself with servility
   [171] to Balak, that it did not depend on himself that he did not
   comply with his wishes, but that God had stood in the way. For he
   grieves at the loss of his reward; and however grandly he may declaim
   on the supremacy of God, he still signifies that he has rather acted
   upon compulsion than willingly executed what was enjoined upon him. By
   "the word (sermonem) of Jehovah," [172] he means not only His decree,
   but what had been dictated to him, and which he would have still
   greatly desired to alter; but he indicates that he was bound by the
   power of the Spirit to declare, even against his own will, whatever
   revelation he received. Thus the word "do" refers to his tongue, or his
   charge as a prophet; since he had not been hired by Balak to perform
   any manual act, but only to injure the people by his words. The word
   "heart" [173] is contrasted with the revelation of the Spirit; for
   impostors are said to speak out of their own heart, when they falsely
   make use of God's name to cover their own inventions. He, therefore,
   declares that he was not at liberty to speak "of his own heart,"
   because he was the minister of the Spirit.

   14. And now, behold, I go unto my people. Since the counsel which he
   gave is not here expressly mentioned, [174] it is the opinion of some
   that his address is unfinished, and they suppose that he referred to
   the cunning advice so destructive to the people, which will be
   presently related; i.e., that the Moabitish women should prostitute
   themselves. Others rather imagine that Balaam counselled Balak to rest
   quiet, since the prosperity of the Israelites would do no harm to the
   Moabites in his lifetime. I, however, take it simply for to teach, or
   to admonish what would be for his advantage. Thus he commends his
   prophecy, in order that Balaam may willingly submit to it. Still, when
   he speaks of the "latter days," he signifies that there was no cause
   for Balak himself to fear or be anxious; since the punishment of his
   nation would be deferred for a long time. In the meantime we see what
   Balak had gained by his trouble; for, whereas he had hitherto only
   heard the people of Israel blessed, he is not compelled to listen to
   what is more painful still, viz., the ruin of his own nation. This is
   the reward of those who strive against God.

   15. Balaam the son of Beor hath said. Inasmuch as he was preparing to
   treat of most important matters, it is not without reason that he
   renews his preface, in order to obtain more authority for his prophecy:
   and although it was not without ambition that he proclaimed these
   magnificent titles, still we cannot doubt but that God would ratify by
   them what he had determined to deliver through the mouth of the
   prophet. It was requisite that this worthless man, whose doctrine would
   otherwise have been contemptible: should be marked out by Divine
   indications; and thus it was that he assumed a character that he did
   not possess, and attributed to himself what only belongs to true
   prophets. I have before explained how the open and the closed eye are
   spoken of in the same sense, though for different reasons: forhe calls
   the eye "hidden," as perceiving the secret things of darkness, which
   are incomprehensible to the human sense; but he claims for himself
   "open eyes," in that he beholds, by prophetic vision, what he is about
   to say, as if he would deny that he was going to speak of things which
   were obscure, and scarcely intelligible to himself.

   17. I shall see him, but not now. [175] Though the verbs are in the
   future tense, they are used for the present; and again, the pronoun him
   designates some one who has not yet been mentioned; and this is a
   tolerably common usage with the Hebrew, especially when referring to
   Jerusalem, or God, or some very distinguished man. The relative is,
   therefore, here put kat exochen for the antecedent: and although there
   can be no doubt but that he alluded to the people of Israel, it is
   still a question whether he designates the head or the whole body; on
   which point I do not make much contention, since it is substantially
   the same thing.

   The reason why Balaam postpones his prophecies to a distant period, is
   in order to afford consolation to Balak, for, as much as he possibly
   can, he seeks to avoid his ill-will, and therefore assures him that,
   although he denounces evil, it was not to be feared at an early period,
   since he treats of things which were as yet far off.

   The second clause must be unquestionably restricted to the head of the
   people, called metaphorically "a Star," and then expressly referred to
   without a figure; for this repetition is common with the Hebrews, by
   which they particularize the same thing twice over. Assuredly he means
   nothing else by "the Sceptre," except what he had indicated by the
   "Star;" and thus he connects the prosperity of the people with the
   kingdom. Hence we gather that its state was not perfect until it began
   to be governed by the hand of a king. For, inasmuch as the adoption of
   the family of Abraham was founded on Christ, only sparks of God's
   blessing shone forth until its completed brightness was manifested in
   Christ. It must be observed, therefore, that when Balaam begins to
   prophesy of God's grace towards the people of Israel, he directs us at
   once to the scepter, as if it were the true and certain mirror of God's
   favor. And, in fact, God never manifested Himself as the Father of this
   people except by Christ. I admit, indeed, that some beginnings existed
   in the person of David, but they were very far from exhibiting the
   fullness of the reality: for the glory of his kingdom was not lasting,
   nay, its chief dignity was speedily impaired by the rebellion of the
   ten tribes, and was finally altogether extinguished; and when David's
   power was at its height, his dominion never extended beyond the
   neighboring nations. The coming forth of the Star and the Sceptre,
   therefore, of which Balaam speaks explicitly, refers to Christ; and
   what we read in the Psalm corresponds with this prophecy;

   "The Lord shall send the sceptre [176] of thy strength out of Sion."
   (Psalm 110:2.)

   Hence it follows that the blessing, of which Balaam speaks, descends
   even to us; for, if the prosperity of the ancient people, their rest,
   their well-ordered government, their dignity, safety, and glory,
   proceeded from the scepter as its unmixed source, there is no doubt but
   that Christ by His coming accomplished all these things more fully for
   us.

   The destruction of the nation of Moab is added as an adjunct of the
   kingdom. And first, indeed, Balaam declares that "its princes shall be
   transfixed." If any prefer to read its "corners," [177] the expression
   is metaphorical, implying that the Sceptre will break through its
   munitions, or destroy what may seem to be strongest. I do not doubt but
   that the same thing is confirmed in what is said of the children of
   Sheth;" for those who take it generally for the whole human race, [178]
   violently wrest the text by their gloss. Balaam is speaking of the
   neighboring nations; and, when in the next verse he goes on to specify
   Edom, he adds Mount Seir by way of explanation. Since the form of the
   two sentences is identical, it is probable that none others than the
   Moabites are meant by the children of Sheth. Still the question arises
   why Balaam attributes to a single nation what was common to all, for
   all who were of the descendants of Sheth equally derived their origin
   from Noah. Some think that they boasted of this descent in order to
   conceal their shame, for we know that the founder of this nation sprang
   from an incestuous connection. But another more satisfactory reason
   occurs to me, viz., that they boasted, like the Amalekites, of the
   extreme antiquity of their race; since, therefore, they desired to be
   reckoned amongst the most ancient nations, it will not be improbable
   that by this ironical appellation their vain-glory was reproved. It
   may, however, have been the case that some one amongst the descendants
   of Moab was distinguished by this name. Still, as I have lately said,
   the Moabites as well as the Edomites were subdued by David, for David
   thus justly celebrates his triumphs over them,

   "Moab is my wash-pot; over Edom will I cast out my shoe,"
   (Psalm 60:8;)

   but then was merely typified, what Christ at length fulfilled, in that
   He reduced under His sway all adverse and hostile nations. Therefore it
   is said, he "shall destroy him that remaineth of the cities," i.e., all
   enemies whom He shall find to be incorrigible.

   20. And when he looked on Amalek. This people had already been destined
   to destruction by a Divine decree; but what God had before declared, is
   here again ratified by Moses. Although the vengeance, which God was
   about to take, lay dormant for many ages, it was at length
   experimentally proved that God had not threatened in vain. But, whilst
   it is true that they were destroyed by Saul, still we learn from the
   history that some still survived, and again inhabited their land. In
   order, therefore, to arrive at the entire accomplishment of this
   prophecy, we must come to Christ, whose kingdom is the eternal
   destruction of all the wicked. Poor and unsatisfactory is the view of
   some commentators [179] who think that Amalek is called "the first of
   the nations," because they first took up arms against Israel, and
   encountered them in order to prevent their advance. Rather is the pride
   of Amalek indirectly rebuked, because they claimed superiority for
   themselves over other nations, and this on the score of their
   antiquity, as if they had been created together with the sun and moon.
   There is then a pointed comparison between this noble origin, and the
   slaughter which awaited them at their end.

   21. And he looked on the Kenites. I have not yet referred to the sense
   in which Balaam is said to have seen the Kenites, as well as the other
   nations; and now, also, I should refrain from doing so, if some did not
   attribute it to prophetical vision, in which opinion I cannot agree:
   for Moses relates as a matter of history that Balaam turned his face in
   the directions in which they respectively lived: and, although he did
   not actually see the people themselves, the sight of the place in which
   they dwelt was sufficient for the purpose of prophecy.

   By the Kenites I understand the Midianites, who were contiguous to the
   Amalekites; for it is altogether unreasonable to refer the name to the
   descendants of Jethro. Forty years had not yet elapsed since Jethro had
   left his son with Moses; and his was only one small family in the
   wilderness of Midian, whereas mention is here made of a people already
   celebrated. Balaam, therefore, designates by synecdoche the Midianites,
   and devotes them also to the punishment they well deserved. Of this
   Gideon was in some measure the minister and executioner, when he routed
   their immense army with three hundred men; and his victory is
   celebrated in Psalm 83:11, and Isaiah 9:4. It is probable that their
   power was broken at that time.

   22. Until Asshur shall carry thee away captive. It is a harsh and
   unnatural construction to apply this to the Kenites; and the majority,
   indeed, consent that it should be referred to the Israelites; yet they
   differ as to the meaning of it, for some take it affirmatively, that
   the Kenites should be wasted, until the Assyrians should conquer the
   Israelites and carry them away captive; some, however, take it
   interrogatlvely, [180] as if it were an abrupt exclamation, How long
   shall Asshur hold thee captive? Thus they conceive the prolonged exile
   of the people is indicated. Undoubtedly it was the purpose of the
   Spirit to shew, by way of correction, that their prosperity, which had
   been previously mentioned, should be mixed with heavy afflictions: for
   slavery is a bitter thing, and exile even worse. Hence we gather that,
   though the Church is blessed by God, it is still in such a way as that
   it shall not cease to be exposed to various calamities. The
   interrogation, therefore, will be most appropriate.

   24. And ships shall come from the coast of Chittim. It is
   unquestionable that the word Chittim is sometimes used for the Greeks.
   Some, indeed, imagine that the Macedonians alone are strictly called by
   this name; it is, however, plain that it is applied generally to the
   whole of Greece. But since the countries beyond the sea were not so
   well known to the Jews as to allow of their distinguishing them,
   Scripture sometimes transfers this same name to Italy. Without doubt in
   Daniel, (Daniel 11:30,) "the ships of Chittim" must be taken for those
   of Italy or Rome; [181] because the angel there predicts that the ships
   of Chittim would come, which should overcome, and render frustrate the
   efforts of Antiochus; which was plainly brought to pass by the mission
   of Popilius. With regard to the present passage, first of all the
   Greeks under Alexander afflicted both Judea and Assyria; and then
   another affliction followed at the hands of the Romans. Since, however,
   Balaam has begun to prophesy of the kingdom of Christ, it is probable
   that the Romans are included together with the Greeks. But from hence
   we more clearly perceive, what I have lately adverted to, that the
   children of God are not so exempted from common evils as not to be
   often involved in them promiscuously with unelievers, as if their
   conditions were precisely identical. Although the Hebrews are placed on
   a par with the Assyrians as their companions in misfortune, still a
   consolation is added, i.e., that the Assyrians also shall perish like
   Chittim, when they have persecuted the Church.

   What Moses adds in conclusion, viz., that Balaam returned to his
   people, and Balak also went to his place, tends to the commendation of
   God's grace, since He dissipates the evil counsels of the wicked like
   clouds, and overthrows their machinations; even as Moses commemorates
   elsewhere this peculiar blessing of God. [182] Micah, too, celebrates
   this amongst other Divine mercies:

   "O my people, (he says,) remember now what Balak king of Moab
   consulted, and what Balaam the son of Beor answered him," etc. (Micah
   6:5.)

   The sum is, that the enemies of the chosen people departed in dishonor
   without accomplishing their purpose, since God put them to confusion.

   Numbers 25

   Numbers 25:1-18

   1. And Israel abode in Shittim, and the people began to commit whoredom
   with the daughters of Moab.

   1. Postquam autem mansit Israel in Sittim, coepit populus scortari eum
   filiabus Moab.

   2. And they called the people unto the sacrifices of their gods: and
   the people did eat, and bowed down to their gods.

   2. Et vocaverunt populum ad sacrificia deorum suorum, comeditque
   populus, et adoraverunt deos earum.

   3. And Israel joined himself unto Baal-peor: and the anger of the Lord
   was kindled against Israel.

   3. Et adjunxit sese Israel ipsi Baal-peor, accensusque est furor
   Jehovae contra Israelem.

   4. And the Lord said unto Moses, Take all the heads of the people, and
   hang them up before the Lord against the sun, that the fierce anger of
   the Lord may be turned away from Israel.

   4. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Assume omnes principes populi, tunc
   suspende eos Jehowe, coram sole: et avertetur ira excandescentiae
   Jehovae ab Israele.

   5. And Moses said unto the judges of Israel, Slay ye every one his men
   that were joined unto Baal-peor.

   5. Dixit ergo Moses ad judices Israel, Occidite quisque viros suos qui
   adjunxerunt se ipsi Baal-peor.

   6. And, behold, one of the children of Israel came, and brought unto
   his brethren a Midianitish woman, in the sight of Moses, and in the
   sight of all the congregation of the children of Israel, who were
   weeping before the door of the tabernacle of the congregation.

   6. Et ecce, quidam de filiis Israel venit, et adduxit fratribus suis
   Madianitidem in oculis Mosis atque in oculis tedus congregationis
   filiorum Israel: ipsi autem flebant ad ostium tabernaculi conventionis.

   7. And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest,
   saw it, he rose up from among the congregation, and took a javelin in
   his hand;

   7. Quod quum vidisset Phinees filius Eleazar filii Aharon sacerdotis,
   surrexit de medio congregationis, et accepit lanceam in manu sua.

   8. And he went after the man of Israel into the tent, and thrust both
   of them through, the man of Israel, and the woman through her belly. So
   the plague was stayed from the children of Israel.

   8. Ingressusque est post virum Israel in tabernaculum, et transfixit
   ambos ipsos, virum Israel et mulierem illam in ventre ejus: et repressa
   fuit plaga a filiis Israel.

   9. And those that died in the plague were twenty and four thousand.

   9. Et mortui sunt plaga ilia quatuor et viginti millia.

   10. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   10. Tunc loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   11. Phinehas, the son of Eleazar, the son of Aaron the priest, hath
   turned my wrath away from the children of Israel, while he was zealous
   for my sake among them, that I consumed not the children of Israel in
   my jealousy.

   11. Phinees filias Eleazar filii Aharon sacerdotis avertit
   excandescentiam meam a filiis Israel, quum zelatus est ipse zelum meum
   in medio eorum, et non consumpsi filios Israel in zelo meo.

   12. Wherefore say, Behold, I give unto him my covenant of peace:

   12. Idcirco dic, Ecce, ego do ei pactum meum, pacis.

   13. And he shall have it, and his seed after him, even the covenant of
   an everlasting priesthood; because he was zealous for his God, and made
   an atonement for the children of Israel.

   13. Et erit ei et semini ejus post eum, pactum sacerdotii perpetui, eo
   quod zelatus est pro Deo suo, et expiavit filios Israel.

   14. Now the name of the Israelite that was slain, even that was slain
   with the Midianitish woman, was Zimri, the son of Salu, a prince of a
   chief house among the Simeonites.

   14. Porro nomen viri Israel percussi, qui percussus est cum
   Madianitide, erat Zimri filius Salu, princeps familiae tribus Simeon.

   15. And the name of the Midianitish woman that was slain was Cozbi, the
   daughter of Zur: he was head over a people, and of a chief house in
   Midian.

   15. Nomen vero mulieris occisae Madianitidis Chozbi filia Sur,
   principis populorum; princeps domus paternae in Madian erat.

   16. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   16. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   17. Vex the Midianites, and smite them:

   17. Angustiis affice Madianitas, et percutias eos:

   18. For they vex you with their wiles, wherewith they have beguiled you
   in the matter of Peor, and in the matter of Cozbi, the daughter of a
   prince of Midian, their sister, which was slain in the day of the
   plague for Peor's sake.

   18. Quia ipsi affiixerunt vos fraudibus suis, quibus fraudulenter
   egerunt contra vos in negotio Peor, et in negotio Chozbi filiae
   principis Madian sororis suae, quae percussa est in die plagae propter
   Peor.


   1 And Israel abode in Shittim. From this narrative we learn assuredly
   that the people were no more able to bear prosperity than adversity.
   Heretofore, either worn out by fatigue, or rendered impatient by
   abstinence and famine, they had often rebelled against God; now, when
   they have entered a habitable land, and are resting in the midst of
   fruitful fields, they are incited by their more comfortable
   dwelling-places, and more pleasant mode of life, to lasciviousness, and
   the indulgence of filthy lusts. Moses relates how, when they had given
   way to their lust, they fell at the same time into whoredom and
   idolatry. We shall presently see that this arose from the counsel of
   Balaam, that the Moabites should prostitute their women to the
   Israelites, in order to entice them by their blandishments to unholy
   worship. Balaam had learnt by experience that God's favor was an
   invincible safeguard to protect the people from all injury. He,
   therefore, invents a plan whereby they may destroy themselves, by not
   only depriving themselves of God's protection, but also by provoking
   His wrath against them. By this fan, then, Balaam stirred up the fire,
   which impelled these poor wretches, inflamed by blind lechery, to
   another crime, by which they might arouse against themselves the enmity
   of God. Consequently Paul, referring to this history, informs us that
   the punishment, which will be mentioned immediately, was inflicted upon
   them for fornication. (1 Corinthians 10:8.) For, although it was God's
   design to avenge the violation of His worship, still it is fitting to
   examine into the origin and source of the evil. Just as, if a drunken
   man has killed a person, the murder will be imputed to his drunkenness,
   so Paul, seeing the Israelites impelled by fornication to idolatry,
   sets before us the punishment as a warning to deter us from
   fornication, which was the primary cause of their chastisement, and the
   means of their corruption. Since, then, the fall from one sin to
   another is so easy, let us hence learn to be more watchful, lest Satan
   should entangle us in his snares. Let us also observe that he creeps
   upon us by degrees in order to entrap us. The Moabitish damsels did not
   straightway solicit the Israelites to worship their idols, but first
   invite them to their banquets, and thus tempt them to idolatry; for, if
   mention had been made at first of idol-worship, perhaps they might have
   shuddered at the atrocity of the crime, to which they allowed
   themselves to be beguiled by degrees. Now, to be present at a feast
   which was celebrated in honor of false gods, was a kind of indirect
   renunciation of the true God; and when they had been attracted thus
   far, they threw aside all shame, and abandoned themselves to that
   extreme act whereby they transfer the honor due only to the one true
   God, to false and imaginary deities.

   3. AndIsrael joined himself to Baal-peor. Moses amplifies their crime
   by this expression, that they bound themselves to the idol in an
   impious alliance; and thus he alludes to that holy union whereby God
   had connected Himself with the people, and accuses them of broken faith
   and wicked rebellion. Nevertheless, it is probable that the people were
   not impelled by superstition, but enticed by the wiles of the women to
   offer worship to idols which they despised. Yet we are told how God
   declared that they were "joined" to the idol, which they merely
   pretended to worship, in order to comply with the ungodly wishes of the
   women. Hence, therefore, this general instruction may be gathered, that
   when we turn aside from pure religion, we in a manner connect ourselves
   with idols, so as to coalesce in one body with them, and conspire to
   renounce the true God.

   Baal was then the general name of almost all idols; but all epithet is
   added to the idol of the Moabites, taken from Mount Peor; nor does it
   appear that we need go in quest of any other etymology, since the name
   of this mountain has recently been mentioned. It was on the same
   principle as in Popery, when they name their Marys after particular
   places, [183] where the most famous statues are worshipped.

   4. And the Lord said unto Moses. We have often seen before how God
   executed His judgments by His own hand, as if He put it forth from
   heaven; He now imposes this office on Moses, although it is evident
   from the context that he was not appointed to execute it alone, but
   that the other judges were associated with him; for it immediately
   follows that Moses intrusted the same charge to them, and thus, what
   was obscure, on account of the brevity with which it is recorded, is
   more clearly expressed. At any rate, it was a notable judgment of God
   Himself, though He employed men as its ministers. Nor does Paul in vain
   exhort [184] us by this example to beware of fornication.

   The mode of the punishment, however, was diverse, for the lower orders
   were slain (by pestilence,) but the leaders were hanged upon the
   gallows, that the sight might awaken more terror; for by "the heads of
   the people" he means those of the highest repute, whose ignominy must
   have been most notable, because the eyes of all men are generally upon
   the great and noble. Hence, also, they deservedly incur the heavier
   punishment, because obscure persons do less harm by their example, nor
   are their acts so generally the objects of imitation. Let, therefore,
   those who are held in esteem beware lest they provoke others to sin by
   their evil deeds, for, in proportion to each man's pre-eminence, the
   less excuse he deserves. Others interpret it differently, as if Moses
   were commanded to fetch the princes to give their sentence against the
   criminals; thus by the pronoun "them" they understood whosoever should
   be convictcd; but it is hardly probable that so great a multitude were
   hanged, and therefore I do not doubt but that reference is made to
   their peculiar punishment:.

   6. And, behold, one of the children of Israel came. Moses here relates
   a case which was foul and detestable beyond others. There is no doubt
   but that many, in the midst of such gross licentiousness as had now for
   some time generally prevailed, had filled the camp with various
   scandalous offenses; but there was something peculiarly enormous in the
   atrocity of this act, in that this impious despiser of God wantonly
   insulted both God and men amidst the tears and lamentations of all, as
   if he were triumphing over all shame and modesty. The multitude were
   weeping before the tabernacle, that is to say, all the pious who
   trembled at the thought of approaching calamity, since they were fully
   persuaded that this licentiousness, accompanied by idolatry and
   sacrilege, would not be unpunished; meanwhile, this abandoned man
   rushes forward, and, in mockery of their tears, leads his harlot in
   procession as it were. No wonder, therefore, that God should have
   exercised such severity, when things had come to this extremity. But it
   must be observed that the order of the history is inverted, since it is
   not credible that, after the Judges had begun to perform their office,
   such an iniquity should be committed. But this narrative is thus
   inserted, in order that it may be more apparent how necessary it was to
   proceed speedily to severe chastisement, since otherwise it would have
   been impossible to apply a remedy in time to so desperate an evil.

   7. And when Phinehas, the son of Eleazar. The courage of Phinehas is
   celebrated, who, whilst the rest were hesitating, inflamed with holy
   zeal, hastens forward to inflict punishment. The backwardness of others
   is therefore condemned by implication, though their tears were
   praiseworthy; but, since they were almost stupified by grief, their
   virtue was not dear from all defect. And certainly, whilst the yet
   unbridled licentiousness of the people was foaming like a tempestuous
   sea, we cannot wonder that the minds of the good were altogether or
   partially disabled. Hence was the zeal of Phinehas the more
   distinguished, when he did not hesitate to provoke so many worthless
   and wicked persons infuriated by their lechery. If any object that he
   transgressed the limits of his calling, when he laid hold of the sword
   with which God had not armed him, to inflict capital punishment, the
   reply is obvious, that our calling is not always confined to its
   ordinary office, inasmuch as God sometimes requires new and unusual
   acts of His servants. As a priest, it was not the office of Phinehas to
   punish crime, but he was called by the special inspiration of God, so
   that, in his private capacity, he had the Holy Spirit as his guide.
   These circumstances, indeed, ought not to be regarded as an example, so
   that a general rule may be laid down from them; though, at the same
   time, God preserves His free right to appoint His servants by privilege
   to act in His behalf as He shall see fit. God's judgment of this case
   may be certainly inferred from its approval, so that we may correctly
   argue that Phinehas was under His own guidance, since He immediately
   afterwards declared that He was pleased with the act, as is also stated
   in Psalm 106:30, 31

   Now, if any private person should in his preposterous zeal take upon
   himself to punish a similar crime, in vain will he boast that he is an
   imitator of Phinehas, unless he shall be thoroughly assured of the
   command of God. Let the answer of Christ, therefore, always be borne in
   mind by us, whereby he restrained His disciples, when they desired,
   like Elijah, to pray that those who had not received them should be
   destroyed by fire from heaven, "Ye know not what manner of spirit ye
   are of." (Luke 9:54, 55.) In order, therefore, that our zeal may be
   approved by God, it must be tempered by spiritual prudence, and
   directed by His authority; in a word, the Holy Spirit must go before
   and dictate what is right.

   9. And those that died in the plague. Paul, when he says that only
   twenty-three thousand died, appears to differ from Moses; but we know
   that the exact account of numbers is not always observed, and it is
   probable that about twenty-four thousand were slain. Paul, therefore,
   subtracted one thousand, and was content with the lesser number; [185]
   from which, however, we may perceive how severe and terrible was the
   punishment, teaching us to beware of provoking God by fornication. For,
   as it is a monstrous thing that so great a multitude should have been
   infected by this foul and shameful sin, so God's fearful judgment
   against adulterers and fornicators is set before us. We have already
   seen that, although they were guilty of a wicked rebellion, still the
   punishment is justly ascribed to their lust, which impelled them to
   idolatry.

   10. And the Lord spake unto Moses. In these words God makes it appear
   that He was the author of the death (of Zimri and Cozbi;) [186] not
   only because He was thus propitiated towards the people, but because He
   calls the zeal of Phinehas His own. [187] It will, however, accord
   equally well whether we take it actively or passively, viz., either
   that Phinehas was inflamed with zeal to vindicate God's glory, or that
   he took upon him the zeal of God Himself. Whichever be preferred, God
   refers to Himself what was done by Phinehas. When He declares that He
   was appeased by the punishment inflicted, let us not imagine that there
   was a meritorious satisfaction, whereby the Papists feign that their
   punishments are redeemed before God. For although the just
   chastisements of sin are sacrifices of sweet savor, they are by no
   means expiations to reconcile God. Besides, there is no question here
   of compensation, but what is meant is, that it was a means of appeasing
   God, when the ungodliness of the people which had, as it were, fanned
   up His wrath into a flame, was repressed by this severe correction.
   Thus, in Psalm 106, the atonement is ascribed not to the act of
   Phinehas, but only to his prayer, [188] because, in right of his
   priesthood, he had humbly interceded for the people. At the same time,
   the statement of Paul is true, that those are not judged by God who
   voluntarily judge themselves, (1 Corinthians 11:31,) since, by their
   penitence, they in a manner prevent this judgment.

   A perpetual priesthood is promised to Phinehas as his reward. If any
   object, that he thus obtained nothing new, since, in accordance with
   the rule of the law, he was the undoubted successor of his father, I
   reply, that it is not un-common that what God had already freely
   promised, He declares that He will give by way of reward. Thus, what
   had been promised to Abraham before the birth of Isaac, is again
   repeated after he was prepared to sacrifice him, (Genesis 22:16:)
   "Because thou hast done this thing, and hast not withheld thy son,"
   therefore, "in blessing I will bless thee, and in thy seed shall all
   the nations of the earth be blessed." Besides, the privilege of a
   single individual is not simply in question here, but it refers to a
   perpetual succession, as if God had promised that his posterity should
   never fail. And assuredly, the change which took place at the
   commencement of Solomon's reign, is not repugnant to this promise, for
   it may be probably inferred that Zadoc, no less than Abiathar, was of
   the race of Phinehas. This covenant is called a "covenant of peace,"
   because it was to be surely established; consequently, it may be
   properly rendered, "My covenant in peace." At any rate, it indicates
   prosperity, as if He had said that Phinehas, together with his
   posterity, should prosperously execute the sacerdotal office.

   14. Now the name of the Israelite. Even as the memory of the just is
   blessed, so also it was equitable that the author of this foul sin
   should be condemned to perpetual infamy. It appears, however, from the
   fact of a part of the disgrace being thrown upon the whole tribe, how
   greatly displeasing to God was this gross enormity. For although the
   tribe of Simeon is not here actually involved in the charge of
   participating in the sin, yet are they all branded with the common mark
   of ignominy for their humiliation, in order that each one of them may
   learn severely to correct whomsoever amongst his relatives he may see
   offending, and by no means to encourage their vices, if he desires to
   do credit to the founder of his race. [189] It is recorded that both
   Zimri and the Midianitish woman were of noble and principal families,
   not only that we may be taught that God's judgment is no respecter of
   persons (aprosopolepton,) in that it does not spare rank, but also that
   the higher a person may be in position, the greater is the disgrace he
   is exposed to if he conduct himself dishonorably, since their very
   dignity renders men's actions more conspicuous.

   Because the paternal house of the harlot is said to have been in
   Midian, some conjecture that she was born in the land of Moab, or, at
   any rate, brought up there among her maternal relatives; but, as the
   matter is unimportant, I leave it undecided.

   17. Vex the Midianites, and smite them. Inasnmch as God constantly
   forbids His people to take vengeance, it is surprising that the people
   of Israel should now be instigated to do so; as if they were not
   already more than enough disposed to it. We must bear in mind, however,
   that since God, who is the just avenger of all wickedness, often makes
   use of men's instrumentality, and constitutes them the lawful ministers
   for the exercise of his vengeance, it must not be altogether condemned
   without exception, but only such vengeance as men themselves are
   impelled to by carnal passions. If any one is injured, straightway he
   is carried away to the desire of vengeance by the stimulus of his own
   private injury; and this is manifestly wrong: but if a person is led to
   inflict punishment by a just and well-regulated zeal towards God, it is
   not his own cause, but that of God which he undertakes. God did not,
   therefore, desire to give reins to His people's anger, so as to repay
   the Midianites as they had deserved in the violence of its impulse; but
   He armed them with His own sword for their punishment; as if He had
   declared that there was a just cause for their war, and that they need
   not fear the charge of cruelty, if they exterminated such obnoxious
   enemies. For, although Balaam alone had imagined this snare, still the
   guilt is laid upon the whole people. In the meantime, the punishment of
   the Moabites is delayed, although they had apparently inflicted the
   grosser injury. Because no good reason here appears why God should
   mercifully bear with the one nation, whilst He hastens speedily to the
   punishment of the others, let us learn to regard His judgments with
   reverence, and not to presume to discuss them further than is lawful.
   Let it be sufficient for us to know that war was justly declared
   against the Midianites, because it was not their fault that Israel was
   not ruined by their iniquitous impiety. [190]

   The Repitition of the same History

   Deuteronomy 4

   Deuteronomy 4:3, 4

   3. Your eyes have scen what the Lord did because of Baal-peor: for all
   the men that followed Baal-peor, the Lord thy God hath destroyed them
   from among you.

   3. Oculi vestri viderunt qum fecit Jehova propter Baal-Peor, omnem enim
   hominem qui perrexerat post Baal-Peor perdidit Jehova Deus tuus e medio
   tui.

   4. But ye that did cleave unto the Lord your God ave alive every one of
   you this day.

   4. Vos autem qui adhaesistis Jehova Deo vestro vivitis universi hodie.


   3. Your eyes have seen what the Lord did. This enlargement more clearly
   shews that so conspicuous was the example given in the punishment, that
   it could not be hidden from even the most ignorant; for Moses does not
   here address those of refined judgment, but the common people
   generally, who had only been spectators. Assuredly, if God's vengeance
   had been less manifest, he would not have so confidently appealed to
   them as witnesses; hence was their stolidity the less excusable, if
   they were blind to so plain and notorious a fact.

   His praise of their constancy I refer to the present case alone; for it
   is abundantly clear that they did not persevere in cleaving to God. The
   meaning is, that there was a manifest discrimination in this Divine
   chastisement, so that the death of the ungodly multitude should
   preserve the pure worship of God among the survivors.

   58. Istae sunt familiae Levitarum, familia Libnitarum, familia

   62. And those that were numbered of them were twenty and three
   thousand, all males, from a month old and upward: for they were not
   numbered among the children of Israel, because there was no inheritance
   given them among the children of Israel.

   62. Et fuerunt numerati eorum, viginti tria millia: omnes mares filio
   mensis et supra: non enim numerati ruerant inter filios Israel, quod
   data non sit illis haereditas inter filios Israel.

   63. These are they that were numbered by Moses and Eleazar the priest,
   who numbered the children of Israel in the plains of Moab, by Jordan,
   near Jericho.

   63. Isti sunt numerati Mosis et Eleazar sacerdotis, qui numeraverunt
   filios Israel in campestribus Moab juxta Jordanem Jericho.

   64. But among these there was not a man of them whom Moses and Aaron
   the priest numbered, when they numbered the children of Israel in the
   wilderness of Sinai:

   64. Inter istos autem non fuit quisquam de numeratis Mosis et Aharon
   sacerdotis qui numeraverant filios Israel in deserto Sinai.

   65. For the Lord had said of them, They shall surely die in the
   wilderness. And there was not left a man of them, save Caleb the son of
   Jephunneh, and Joshua the son of Nun.

   65. Dixerat enim Jehova de illis, Moriendo morientur in deserto, et non
   fuit superstes ex eis quisquam, nisi Caleb filius Jephuneh, et Josue
   filius Nun.


   1. And it came to pass after the plague. This is the second census
   which we read of having been made by Moses; nevertheless it is easy to
   perceive, from Exodus 38, that it was at least the third; although it
   is more probable that either yearly, or at stated times, those who had
   arrived at the age of twenty gave in their names. Still the number of
   the people could not be thus obtained, unless there were also a
   comparison of the deaths. This, at any rate, is incontrovertible, that
   those who had grown up to manhood were three times numbered in the
   desert, for we gather thus much from the passage before us, since it is
   said in the fourth verse that this enrolment was made "as the Lord had
   commanded Moses, and the children of Israel, which went forth out of
   the land of Egypt;" from whence it is plain not only that they followed
   as their rule the custom established from the beginning, but that the
   census of the people was again taken, as it had been in the wilderness
   of Sinai. From hence again a probable conjecture may be made, that,
   from the time in which they came out from thence, nothing similar had
   taken place in the interval. For Moses there records how many talents
   were collected from the tribute of the people, and mentions their
   number, viz., 603,550 [191] and he adds afterwards, when they moved
   their camp from Mount Sinai, how the census was taken according to
   God's command; but I pass over this subject the more cursorily, as
   having been already spoken of elsewhere. [192]

   Now let us see with what object God desired to have His people numbered
   before He led them into the possession of the promised land. In less
   than forty years the whole generation of an age for military service
   had perished: many had been carried off by premature deaths; nay, a
   single scourge had lately destroyed 24,000; who would not have thought
   that the people must have been diminished by a fourth? We must then
   account it a remarkable miracle, that their numbers should be found as
   great as they were before. It was a memorable proof of God's anger that
   only two of the 603,000 still survived; but that by continued
   generation the people were so renewed, as that, at the conclusion of
   the period, their posterity equalled their former number, was the work
   of God's inestimable grace. Thus, in that awful judgment wherewith God
   punished His sinful people, the truth of His promise still shone forth.
   It had been said to Abraham,

   "I will multiply thy seed as the stars of the heaven, and as the sand
   which is upon the sea-shore," (Genesis 22:17;)

   and it was by no means fitting that this blessing should be obscured at
   the time, when the other part of the promise was about to be fulfilled:
   "Unto thy seed will I give this land." (Genesis 12:7;) For, whilst the
   people had been instructed by punishments to fear God, still they were
   not to lose the savor of His paternal favor. And thus does God always
   temper His judgments towards His Church, so as in the midst of His
   indignation to remember mercy, as Habakkuk says, (Habakkuk 3:2.) This
   was the reason why the people was numbered immediately after the
   plague, in order that it might be more conspicuous that God had
   marvellously provided lest any diminution should appear after the
   recent loss of so many men.

   8 And the sons of Pallu; Eliab. The curtailment which had occurred in
   the superior line is here introduced, either in exaltation of God's
   grace, because, notwithstanding so great a loss, the tribe of Reuben
   was still numerous; or else to mark the cause of its diminution, for it
   might otherwise have seemed strange that other tribes exceeded in
   numbers that one whose founder and parent was Jacob's first-born. But
   when he has narrated how the two sons of Eliab had been destroyed with
   their company, he briefly adverts to the clemency of God towards the
   sons of Korah, in that He spared them. And surely this was no common
   exercise of mercy not only to preserve them uninjured from the
   calamity, but afterwards to raise up shoots from the accursed root, in
   whom His spiritual riches might shine forth for the general advantage
   of the Church: for we know what honorable mention is often made of this
   family; and it is probable that certain of them were the authors of
   some of the Psalms, and thus were endued with the Spirit of prophecy,
   when possibly at that time none of the priests was possessed of this
   gift. This is that profound abyss in the various and unequal judgments
   of God, which it becomes us to adore with sober humility. Meanwhile, in
   a single word, Moses hints at the reason why he repeats this same
   history, whereby the formidable mode of their death might be held up as
   a perpetual example: for the Hebrew word ns, nes, which is primarily a
   standard [193] or banner, is often used for some portentous thing,
   which strikes men's senses with astonishment, and at the same time
   fills their minds with fear.

   19. The sons of Judah were Er and Onan. Since the tribe of Judah was so
   numerous, Moses magnifies the greatness of God's grace by this
   circumstance, that of the three sons which he begat, two perished in
   the land of Canaan, by whose loss he might have appeared to be
   condemned to perpetual sterility. But the climax of God's unparalleled
   mercy was this, that although two of his children were born of an
   incestuous connection, they grew up into so great a people.

   28. The sons of Joseph after their families. The comparison of the two
   tribes, which sprang from the same head, is worthy of notice. By the
   fact that Manasseh was the father of only one son, [194] the prophecy
   of Jacob, when he declared that the first-born should be inferior to
   his younger brother Ephraim, began already to receive its
   accomplishment. Nevertheless, God's blessing extended far and wide for
   the increase of his family, so that they exceeded the tribe of Reuben
   in number. But further, though the larger number of children
   (poluteknia) in which the descendants of Ephraim were superior, was a
   kind of type of his promised fecundity, still the excellency and
   dignity, of which Jacob prophesied, was deferred to a distant period;
   since in this respect the tribe of Ephraim was inferior by about a
   third, whereas a more numerous issue had been promised him. Although,
   therefore, God had not spoken in vain, yet the fulfillment of His
   promise did not immediately appear.

   In the tribe of Dan, however, the incredible power of God was put
   forth. He was contemptible among his brethren; and thence it was an
   extraordinary blessing accorded to him in the shape of an honorable
   degree and name, when Jacob declares that "Dan shall judge his people."
   (Genesis 49:16.) He is said to have begotten only one son; yet his
   posterity exceeds 64,000.

   51. These are the numbered of the children of Israel. By this sum
   total, what I have above adverted to is more clearly shewn, that amidst
   so many losses, and especially after the terrible vengeance which God
   had recently executed, the race of Abraham was preserved in an
   incredible manner, so that the fulfillment of the promise might not be
   brought about only towards a small body of persons. Nature itself and
   reason would have suggested that a few only should enjoy the promised
   land; but if the inheritance had been restricted to a small number of
   men, God's promise would have lain, as it were, in obscurity and
   concealment. Yet within thirty-eight years, during which more than
   603,000 men had fallen, God marvellously brought it to pass that the
   same number of persons should still remain, some 2500 only excepted.
   Assuredly they must be blind four times over, as it were, who do not
   behold in this bright mirror God's wonderful providence, and the
   faithfulness of His gratuitous adoption, and His steadfastness in
   keeping His promises. At the same time, that which I have already
   referred to in Deuteronomy clearly appears, that those who survived,
   were strikingly admonished by this great loss, that they should not
   fall away at any time into superstition.

   53. Unto these the land shall be divided. This must have had great
   influence towards encouraging believers, when they gave in their names
   before God, and professed that they were heirs of the land; since it
   was exactly the same as if they actually had it in their grasp, when
   God called them to its certain possession; for the demonstrative
   pronoun is used emphatically, lest they should suppose that they were
   to be put off any longer, and that what was promised them was still to
   be kept in store for their posterity. The actual fulfillment,
   therefore, and immediate presence of the thing is indicated, when God
   prescribes that the land was to be divided to those who were just
   numbered, and whose names appeared in the public registers. A
   proportionable mode of division is then enjoined, so that their share
   should be distributed to every tribe according to the number of their
   names. We now perceive that they were registered, and, so to speak,
   [195] lustrated, in order that they might more earnestly bestir
   themselves to take possession of the promised land.

   57. And these are they that were numbered of the Levites. He treats
   separately of the tribe of Levi, which God had dissevered from the rest
   of the people; and of the sons of Levi, the last mentioned is Kohath,
   the founder of the sacerdotal family. Hence we may probably conjecture
   that the law of primogeniture was not regarded when God deigned to take
   the priests from thence. But why Moses should expressly state the name
   of his mother, contrary to the usual custom of Scripture, does not
   dearly appear; for it is not likely that he did this as a distinction
   to his own family, because he at the same time shews how he himself, as
   well as his children, was deprived of the honor (of the priesthood,)
   [196] in which certainly there is no appearance of ambition. It is more
   probable, if the word daughter is literally taken, that he did not
   conceal a disgraceful circumstance, in order to extol more highly the
   indulgence of God; for, in this case, Moses and Aaron sprang of an
   incestuous marriage, since Amram, their father, must have married his
   aunt, which natural modesty forbade. It will, then, be rather an
   ingenuous confession of family dishonor, than an ambitious boast. If we
   inquire how this could have been tolerated, the answer will readily
   suggest itself, that this license had so largely prevailed among the
   oriental nations, that no one deemed that to be illicit which was in
   such universal use. And this we shall presently see [197] to be
   expressly referred to, when God, by forbidding incestuous marriages,
   distinguishes His people from other nations. It will be no matter of
   surprise, then, that those who were not yet prohibited from doing so by
   the law of God, had followed the general custom.

   60. And unto Aaron was born Nadab. Since two of Aaron's four sons were
   cut off by a sudden death, the dignity of the high-priesthood, which
   depended on the life of two persons, appeared to be endangered. And
   with this view Moses repeats the history already given, in order that
   God's wonderful providence might be more clearly perceived in the
   preservation of this order, with which the safety of the whole Church
   was connected. Unquestionably, unless other families had been much more
   prolific, the whole tribe of Levi would have consisted of very few
   persons; yet, if we come to compare them, their fecundity will be
   incredible, inasmuch as 23,000 are numbered, whereas the sacerdotal
   race issued from only two heads. But God exalts His Church to
   pre-eminence by ways and means unknown to men, in order that His power
   may be magnified in this weakness. Moreover, the cause of their death
   is again recorded, that the priests, being admonished by this warning,
   may not only more diligently beware of wilful sacrilege, but also of
   error and negligence.

   63. These are they that were numbered. The former registration was made
   by Aaron. The difference between the two census is therefore specified,
   in order that Moses may take occasion to commemorate God's judgment,
   which can never be sufficiently considered, that of 600,000, only two
   were found who had survived to the term prescribed by God. If any
   should object that the greater part would have died naturally, since
   they had arrived at their thirtieth: fortieth, and even fiftieth year,
   [198] and thus would have been some eighty years old before the
   completion of the forty years, I admit that such is the case; but many
   had not yet reached their twenty-fourth year. Nor can we doubt but that
   not a few of them were younger than Caleb and Joshua, whom we know to
   have been not only alive and well, but even strong and vigorous for
   many years afterwards. At any rate, therefore, not old age, but God's
   vengeance, cut off half of them by an untimely death, as if he had
   openly put forth his hand from heaven and smitten them. It is not
   without reason, then, that Moses states that they were dead, as God had
   pronounced; not merely that by the punishment inflicted upon them he
   may inculcate upon us the fear of God, but also that we may learn to be
   aroused in earnest by his threats.

   Numbers 27

   Numbers 27:1-11

   1. Then came the daughters of Zelophehad, the son of Hepher, the son of
   Gilead, the son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of
   Manasseh the son of Joseph: and these are the names of his daughters,
   Mahlah, Noah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Tirzah.

   1. Accesserunt autem filiae Salphaad, filii Hepher, filii Galaad, filii
   Machir, filii Manasse de familiis Manasse, filii Joseph: haec vero sunt
   nomina filiarum ejus, Malhah, Noah, Hoglah, et Milchah, et Thirsah.

   2. And they stood before Moses, and before Eleazar the priest, and
   before the princes and all the congregation, by the door of the
   tabernacle of the congregation, saying,

   2. Hac steterunt coram Mose et coram Eleazar sacerdote, et coram
   principibus atque universa congregatione ad ostium tabernaculi
   conventionis, dicendo:

   3. Our father died in the wilderness, and he was not in the company of
   them that gathered themselves together against the Lord in the company
   of Korah; but died in his own sin, and had no sons.

   3. Pater noster mortuus est in deserto, qui tamen non fuit in
   congregatione qum congregata fuit adversus Jehovam, in congregatione
   Core: quia in peccato mortuus est, et filii non fuerunt el.

   4. Why should the name of our father be done away from among his
   family, because he hath no son? Give unto us therefore a possession
   among the brethren of our father.

   4. Quare tolletur nomen patris nostri de medio familiae suae, propterea
   quod non sit ei filius? da nobis haereditatem inter fratres patris
   nostri.

   5. And Moses brought their cause before the Lord.

   5. Retulit autem Moses causam earum coram Jehova.

   6. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   6. Et respondit Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   7. The daughters of Zelophehad speak right: thou shalt surely give them
   a possession of an inheritance among their father's brethren: and thou
   shalt cause the inheritance of their father to pass unto them.

   7. Rectum filiae Salphaad loquuntur: dando dabis eis possessionem
   haereditatis in medio fratrum patris sui, et transferes haereditatem
   patris earum ad eas.

   8. And thou shalt speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a man
   die and have no son, then ye shall cause his inheritance to pass unto
   his daughter.

   8. Ad filios autem Israel loqueris, dicendo, Quum quis mortuus fuerit,
   et filius non fuerit illi, tum transferetis haereditatem ejus ad filiam
   ipsius.

   9. And if he have no daughter, then ye shall give his inheritance unto
   his brethren.

   9. Quod sinon fuerit ei filia, tunc dabitis haereditatem ejus fratribus
   ipsius.

   10. And if he have no brethren, then ye shall give his inheritance unto
   his father's brethren.

   10. Si vero non fuerint ei fratres, tunc dabitis haereditatem ejus
   fratribus patris ipsius.

   11. And if his father have no brethren, then ye shall give his
   inheritance unto his kinsman that is next to him of his family, and he
   shall possess it: and it shall be unto the children of Israel a statute
   of judgment; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   11. Quod si non fuerint fratres patri ipsius, tunc dabitis haereditatem
   ejus propinquiori illi de familia ipsius, haereditatemque accipiet
   illam: erit autem istud filiis Israel in statutum judicii, quemadmodum
   praecepit Jehova Mosi.


   1. Then came the daughters of Zelophehad. A narrative is here
   introduced respecting the daughters of Zelophehad, of the family of
   Machir, who demanded to be admitted to a share of its inheritance; and
   the decision of this question might have been difficult, unless all
   doubt had been removed by the sentence of God Himself. For, since in
   the law no name is given to women, it would seem that no account of
   them was to be taken in the division of the land. And, in fact, God
   laid down this as the general rule; but a special exception is here
   made, i.e., that whenever a family shall be destitute of male heirs,
   females should succeed, for the preservation of the name. I am aware
   that this is a point which is open to dispute, since there are obvious
   arguments both for and against it, but let the decree that God
   pronounced suffice for us.

   Although (the daughters of Zelophehad) plead before Moses for their own
   private advantage, still the discussion arose from a good principle;
   inasmuch as they would not have been so anxious about the succession,
   if God's promise had not been just as much a matter of certainty to
   them as if they were at this moment demanding to be put in possession
   of it. They had not yet entered the land, nor were their enemies
   conquered; yet, relying on the testimony of Moses, they prosecute their
   suit as if the tranquil possession of their rights were to be accorded
   them that very day. And this must have had the effect of confirming the
   expectations of the whole people, when Moses consulted God as
   respecting a matter of importance, and pronounced by revelation that
   which was just and right; for the discussion, being openly moved before
   them all, must have given them encouragement, at least to imitate these
   women.

   3. Our father died in the wilderness. The plea they allege is no
   contemptible one, i.e., that their father died after God had called His
   people to the immediate possession of the promised land; for, if the
   question had been carried back to an earlier period, it might have
   originated many quarrels. This restriction with respect to time,
   therefore, aided their cause. In the second place, they plead that
   their father had committed no crime whereby he might have been excepted
   from the general allotment of the land; for in the conspiracy of Dathan
   and Abiram, they include by synecdoche, in my opinion, the other sins,
   whose punishment affected the posterity of the criminals. His private
   sin is, therefore, contrasted with public ignominy; for so I interpret
   what they say of his having "died in his own sin." And surely it is
   mere childish nonsense which the Jews [199] affirm of his having been
   the man who gathered sticks on the Sabbath-day, or one of the number of
   those who were slain by the bite of the serpents; and it is unnatural,
   too, to refer it to the curse under which the whole human race is laid.
   They distinguish, then, his private sin from any public crime, which
   would have caused him to deserve to be disinherited, lest the condition
   of their father should be worse than that of any other person. At the
   same time, they hold fast to the principle which is dictated to us by
   the common feelings of religion, that death, as being the curse of God,
   is the wages of sin.

   5. And Moses brought their cause before the Lord. It is probable either
   that there was a difference of opinion, or that the minds of the judges
   were in doubt, as respecting an obscure and uncertain point. At any
   rate, it was expedient that the law should be laid down by God, lest
   any future controversy should arise; for, if a sentence had been
   pronounced by human judgment on the matter before them, the obstinacy
   of many would not perhaps have been sufficiently set at rest. It is
   worth while to remark the pious modesty of Moses, who was not ashamed
   to confess his ignorance, until he had been instructed by the mouth of
   God. Although he had promulgated the law forty years before, still he
   was always ready to learn. Besides, there is no doubt but that God
   impelled him to inquire of Himself, whenever any serious matters were
   in question, until his doctrine was absolutely perfect. And, although
   God does not now deliver from heaven what is to be done, nevertheless
   rulers are reminded that they ought to have recourse to God in points
   of perplexity, in order that He may instruct them by the Spirit of
   wisdom; and assuredly they will not be without this, if they ask Him;
   since he is no less ready to listen to them, than He here shewed
   Himself to be to Moses.

   8. And thou shalt speak to the children of Israel. This question was
   the occasion of the delivery of a law, which was to be a perpetual and
   general rule as to the right of inheritance. But, although God prefers
   the daughters to all other relatives, when there is no male issue,
   still, with this single exception of the first degree, He admits none
   but males to the succession, and thus preserves the usual order. And
   surely it would be very unjust to exclude a man's (natural) heirs on
   account of their sex; but when it became necessary to pass from his own
   children to other kindred, the prerogative of the male line began to be
   established. I speak of the land of Canaan, in which not only the name
   of Abraham but also that of the twelve tribes was to be preserved, in
   order that the memory (of God's blessing) [200] might be more distinct
   and unclouded.

   Numbers 36

   Numbers 36:1-13

   1. And the chief fathers of the families of the children of Gilead, the
   son of Machir, the son of Manasseh, of the families of the sons of
   Joseph, came near, and spake before Moses, and before the princes, the
   chief fathers of the children of Israel.

   1. Accesserunt vero principes patrum e familia filiorum Gilad filii
   Machir, filii Manasse de familiis filiorum Joseph, et loquuti sunt
   coram Mose, et cotare prineipibus capitibus patrum filiorum Israel:

   2. And they said, The Lord commanded my lord to give the land for an
   inheritance by lot to the children of Israel: and my lord was commanded
   by the Lord to give the inheritance of Zelophehad our brother unto his
   daughters.

   2. Ac dixerunt, Domino meo praecepit Jehova ut daret terram in
   possessionem sorte filiis Israel, etiam domino meo praeceptum est a
   Jehova ut daret possessionem Salphaad fratris nostri filiabus ejus.

   3. And if they be married to any of the sons of the other tribes of the
   children of Israel, then shall their inheritance be taken from the
   inheritance of our fathers, and shall be put to the inheritance of the
   tribe whereunto they are received: so shall it be taken from the lot of
   our inheritance.

   3. Quae si alicui de filiis aliarum tribuum filiorum Israel dentur in
   uxores, minuetur haereditas earum ah haereditate patrum nostrorum,
   addeturque haereditati tribus quibus nupserunt, et de sorte
   haereditatis nostrae minuetur.

   4. And when the jubilee of the children of Israel shall be, then shall
   their inheritance be put unto the inheritance of the tribe whereunto
   they are received; so shall their inheritance be taken away from the
   inheritance of the tribe of our fathers.

   4. Quumque fuerit jubilams fillis Israel, addetur haereditas earum
   haereditati tribus quibus nupserint: atque de haereditate tribus patrum
   nostrorum detrahetur haereditas earum.

   5. And Moses commanded the children of Israel according to the word of
   the Lord, saying, The tribe of the sons of Joseph hath said well.

   5. Princepit itaque Moses filiis Israel juxta sermonem Jehovae,
   dicendo, Rectum tribus filiorum Joseph loquitur.

   6. This is the thing which the Lord doth command concerning the
   daughters of Zelophehad, saying, Let them marry to whom they think
   best: only to the family of the tribe of their father shall they marry:

   6. Hoc est quod praecepit Jehova de filiabus Salphaad, dicendo, Ut
   placebit illis, sint in uxores, veruntamen familiae tribus patris sui
   sint in uxores.

   7. So shall not the inheritance of the children of Israel remove from
   tribe to tribe; for every one of the children of Israel shall keep
   himself to the inheritance of the tribe of his fathers.

   7. Ne transferatur haereditas filiorum Israel de tribu ad tribum: nam
   filii Israel singuli adhaerebunt haereditatibus patrum suorum.

   8. And every daughter that possesseth an inheritance in any tribe of
   the children of Israel, shall be wife unto one of the family of the
   tribe of her father, that the children of Israel may enjoy every man
   the inheritance of his fathers.

   8. Et omnis filia quae possederit haereditatem de tribubus filiorum
   Israel, uni de familia tribus patris sui erit in uxorem, ut possideant
   filii Israel singuli haereditatem patrum suorum:

   9. Neither shall the inheritance remove from one tribe to another
   tribe; but every one of the tribes of the children of Israel shall keep
   himself to his own inheritance.

   9. Ne transferatur possessio de tribu ad tribum aliam: sed singuli ex
   tribubus filiorum Israel haereditati sum adhaarebunt.

   10. Even as the Lord commanded Moses, so did the daughters of
   Zelophehad:

   10. Quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova Mosi sic fecerunt filiea Salphaad.

   11. For Mahlah, Tirzah, and Hoglah, and Milcah, and Noah, the daughters
   of Zelophehad, were married unto their father's brothers' sons.

   11. Nam Mahalah, Thirsah, et Hoglah, et Milcah, et Noah, filiae
   Salphaad, filiis patruorum suorum fuerunt in uxores:

   12. And they were married into the families of the sons of Manasseh the
   son of Joseph; and their inheritance remained in the tribe of the
   family of their father.

   12. His qui erant de familia filiorum Manasse filii Joseph fuerunt in
   uxores, fuitque haereditas earum tribui familiaepatris earum.

   13. These are the commandments and the judgments which the Lord
   commanded, by the hand of Moses, unto the children of Israel in the
   plains of Moab, by Jordan near Jericho.

   13. Ista aunt praecepta et judicia quae princepit Jehova per manum
   Mosis filiis Israel in campestribus Moab juxta Jordanem Jericho.


   1. And the chief fathers of the families. It might appear strange that
   God had given an imperfect law with reference to succession, as if what
   will be now stated had not occurred to His mind until Moses was
   reminded by the chief men of the families (of Machir,) [201] that it
   was unjust that the inheritances should be alienated, which would have
   been the case if the daughters of Zelophehad had married into other
   tribes, whereas their portion had fallen in the lot of the tribe of
   Manasseh. For whatever fell into the hands of those of another tribe,
   was a diminution of that lot. As, therefore, God had lately made
   provision for preserving the rights of individuals, He now treats of
   the general advantage or loss. What, then, can be the meaning of the
   objection, that God only half considered what was right? In my opinion,
   He so arranged His replies, that only when inquired of He assigned to
   each one his rights. The daughters of Zelophehad come, and demand
   justice of Moses and the elders, and God complies with their prayers.
   Now the heads of the tribe come, and agitate the question respecting
   the loss they would incur by the alienation of the inheritances; and it
   is then provided that other tribes should not be enriched by their
   loss. In short, whereas God might have spontaneously anticipated this,
   He preferred to grant it at the request of those who asked nothing but
   what was just and equitable. For it cannot be said that in this case it
   happened, as it often does, that, whilst every one pertinaciously
   maintains his own cause, and is eager to advance his own interests, one
   question arises out of another; for, when God has taken cognizance of
   the case, He pronounces that both parties only demanded what was right.
   It follows, therefore, that God designedly withheld His decisions until
   they naturally arose out of the circumstances of the case. It is a
   common saying that the law makes no provision for those things which
   rarely occur. [202] Thus it would have been commonly supposed that this
   law was superfluous; and especially it would have detracted somewhat
   from the authority of his teaching, if Moses had treated of this
   trifling matter, had not circumstances led to it. In fine, God allowed
   Himself to be interrogated familiarly with respect to doubtful points
   of no primary importance, in order that posterity might recognize His
   reply as a proof of His fatherly indulgence. Meanwhile, let us bear in
   mind that if heavenly things are the subject of as much anxiety to us,
   as earthly things were to the children of Manasseh, the rule that we
   should observe will always be made clear to us.

   2. And they said, The Lord commanded my lord. They here allege a kind
   of discrepancy, in that the tribes had had the land allotted to them
   agreeably to God's command, but now their lots would be thrown into
   confusion, when the inheritance should pass over to another tribe. They
   assume it, however, to be an acknowledged impossibility, that God
   should be inconsistent with Himself: hence it was necessary that an
   interpretation should be delivered in order to remove the legal
   contradiction (antinomian) The Law of God, say they, which ought to
   remain inviolable, enjoins that the land should be distxibuted by lot;
   how, then, will it accord that women should carry elsewhere the
   inheritance of their own tribe? Thus, in seeking a remedy for this
   evil, they submit themselves to God's governance, and reverently accept
   what He had prescribed. And further, they enlarge upon the absurdity
   which would arisen from hence; viz., that in the fiftieth year, when
   they were to return to their original lots, so much would be withdrawn
   from the portion of the tribe of Manasseh as the daughters of
   Zelophehad had taken away with them. Reasonably, therefore, do they
   demand that a decree should be given to reconcile the two former laws,
   which otherwise appeared to be at variance with each other.

   5. And Moses commanded the children of Israel. The account here given
   is not identical with the previous one, that Moses referred the matter
   to God; yet the same thing is more briefly stated, viz., that Moses
   answered the people out of the mouth of God, from whence we infer that
   God was consulted by him. Moreover, God not only decides in favor of
   the children of Manasseh, but approves of their appeal, in that they
   were contented with their allotment, and claim for themselves what
   could not be alienated without the violation of the Divine decree. From
   this particular occasion, a general law is laid down, that no woman to
   whom an inheritance had fallen, was to marry out of her tribe, because
   she would defraud her own relatives of her marriage portion. In this
   way, however, a free permission to marry was accorded to females,
   provided they renounced their paternal inheritance. The words, indeed,
   seem to be of wider application, i e., that no man should marry a wife,
   except of his own kindred; but the meaning of the law is to be sought
   from the cause which led to its enactment. Moreover, there is no doubt
   but that promiscuous marriages are here forbidden, in so far as they
   confound the order of hereditary rights.

   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   1. Et loquutus est Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   2. Avenge the children of Israel of the Midianites: afterwards shalt
   thou be gathered unto thy people.

   2. Ulciscere ultionem filiorum Israel de Madianitis, postea
   aggregaberis ad populos tuos.

   3. And Moses spake unto the people, saying, Arm some of yourselves unto
   the war, and let them go against the Midianites, and avenge the Lord of
   Midian.

   3. Loquutus est itaque Moses ad populum, dicendo, Accingant se ex vobis
   viri ad bellum, et sint contra Madian, ut dent ultionem Jehovae.

   4. Of every tribe a thousand, throughout all the tribes of Israel,
   shall ye send to the war.

   4. Mille de singulis tribubus, de omnibus tribubus Israel mittetis ad
   bellum.

   5. So there were delivered out of the thousands of Israel, a thousand
   of every tribe, twelve thousand armed for war.

   5. Et traditi sunt ex millibus Israel mille per singulas tribus,
   duodecim millia accineti ad militiam.

   6. And Moses sent them to the war, a thousand of every tribe, them and
   Phinehas the son of Eleazar the priest, to the war, with the holy
   instruments, and the trumpets to blow in his hand.

   6. Quos misit Moses, mille de singulis tribubus ad bellum: misit,
   inquam, illos et Phinees filium Eleazar sacerdotis ad bellum, et vasa
   sancta, et tubae clangoris erant in manu ejus.

   7. And they warred against the Midianites, as the Lord commanded Moses;
   and they slew all the males.

   7. Et pugnaverunt contra Madian, quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova Mosi,
   et occiderunt omnem masculum.

   8. And they slew the kings of Midian, besides the rest of them that
   were slain; namely, Evi, and Rekem, and Zur, and Hut, and Reba, five
   kings of Midian: Balaam also the son of Beor they slew with the sword.

   8. Reges quoque Madian occiderunt cum occisis eorum, Evi et Recem, et
   Sur, et Hur, et Reba, quinque reges Madian: et Balaam filium Beor
   occiderunt gladio.

   9. And the children of Israel took all the women of Midian captives,
   and their little ones, and took the spoil of all their cattle, and all
   their flocks, and all their goods.

   9. Abduxerunt autem captivas filii Israel uxores Madianitarum, et
   parvulos eorum, atque omnia jumenta eorum, omniaque pecora eorum, et
   omnem substantiam corum praedati sunt.

   10. And they burnt all their cities wherein they dwelt, and all their
   goodly castles with fire.

   10. Omnes quoque urbes eorum per habitationes eorum et omnes, aedes
   combusserunt igni.

   11. And they took all the spoil, and all the prey, both of men and of
   beasts.

   11. Tuleruntque crania spolia, et omnem praedam, tam de hominibus quam
   de jumentis.

   12. And they brought the captives, and the prey, and the spoil, unto
   Moses, and Eleazar the priest, and unto the congregation of the
   children of Israel, unto the camp at the plains of Moab, which are by
   Jordan near Jericho.

   12. Et adduxerunt ad Mosen et Eleazar sacerdotem, et ad congregationem
   fillerum Israel, captivitatem, et praedam, et spolia ad castra ipsa in
   campestribus Moab, quae sunt juxta Jordanem Jericho.

   13. And Moses and Eleazar the priest, and all the princes of the
   congregation, went forth to meet them without the camp.

   13. Egressi sunt ergo Moses et Eleazar sacerdos, et omnes principes
   congregationis in occursum eorum extra eastra.

   14. And Moses was wroth with the officers of the host, with the
   captains over thousands, and captains over hundreds, which came from
   the battle.

   14. Iratusque est Moses contra praefectos exercitus, tribunes et
   centuriones qui revertebantur de expeditione belli.

   15. And Moses said unto them, Have ye saved all the women alive?

   15. Et dixit els Moses, Reservastisne omnes mulieres?

   16. Behold, these caused the children of Israel, through the counsel of
   Balaam, to commit trespass against the Lord in the matter of Peor, and
   there was a plague among the congregation of the Lord.

   16. Ecce, ipsae fuerunt filiis Israel, consilio Balaam ad tradendum in
   praevaricationem contra Jehovam in negotio Phogor, et fuit plaga in
   congregatione Jehovae.

   17. Now therefore kill every male among the little ones, and kill every
   woman that hath known man by lying with him.

   17. Nunc ergo occidite omnes mares in parvulis, et omnem mulierem qum
   cognoverit virum concubitu masculi, occidite.

   18. But all the women-children, that have not known a man by lying with
   him, keep alive for yourselves.

   18. Omnes autem parvulas inter mulieres, qum non cognoverint concubitum
   masculi, servate vivas vobis.

   19. And do ye abide without the camp seven days: whosoever hath killed
   any person, and whosoever hath touched any slain, purify both
   yourselves and your captives on the third day, and on the seventh day.

   19. Vos vero manete extra castra septem diebus: omnis qui occiderit
   aliquem, quicunqne item tetigerit occisum, purificabitis vos die tertia
   et die septima, vos et praeda vestra.

   20. And purify all your raiment, and all that is made of skins, and all
   work of goats' hair, and all things made of wood.

   20. Omne quoque vestimentum, et omnem supellectilem pelliceam, et omne
   opus e pilis caprarum, et omne vas lineum purificabitis.

   21. And Eleazar the priest said unto the men of war which went to the
   battle, This is the ordinance of the law which the Lord commanded
   Moses;

   21. Et dixit Eleazar sacerdos admilites qui iverant ad bellum, hoc est
   statutum legis quod praeceperat Jehova Mosi.

   22. Only the gold, and the silver, the brass, the iron, the tin, and
   the lead,

   22. Profecto aurum, et argentum, aes, ferrum, stannum, et plumbum, et
   quiequid ingreditur ignem, transire facietis per ignem, et mundabitur;

   23. Every thing that may abide the fire, ye shall make it go through
   the fire, and it shall be clean; nevertheless it shall be purified with
   the water of separation: and all that abideth not the fire ye shall
   make go through the water.

   23. Veruntamen aqua expiationis purificabitur, quicquid autem non
   ingreditur ignem, transire facietis per aquam.

   24. And ye shall wash your clothes on the seventh day, and ye shall be
   clean, and afterward ye shall come into the camp.

   24. Lavabitis praeterea vestimenta vestra die septima, et mundi eritis,
   et postea intrabitis castra.

   25. And the Lord spalke unto Moses, saying,

   25. Loquutus est deinde Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   26. Take the sum of the prey that was taken, both of man and of beast,
   thou, and Eleazar the priest, and the chief fathers of the
   congregation;

   26. Cape summam praedm captivitatis, tam de hominibus quam de jumentis,
   tu et Eleazar sacerdos, et capita patrum congregationis.

   27. And divide the prey into two parts, between them that took the war
   upon them, who went out to battle, and between all the congregation;

   27. Et partieris in duas partes praedam, inter bellatores qui egressi
   sunt ad pugnam, et inter universam congregationem.

   28. And levy a tribute unto the Lord of the men of war which went out
   to battle: one soul of five hundred, both of the persons, and of the
   beeves, and of the asses, and of the sheep:

   28. Tollesque censum Jehovae a viris bellatoribus qui egressi sunt ad
   militiam, unam animam de quingentis, ex hominibus, et ex bobus, et ex
   asinis, et ex pecudibus.

   29. Take it of their half, and give it unto Eleazar the priest, for an
   heave-offering of the Lord.

   29. De media parte illorum capietis: et dabitis Eleazaro sacerdoti
   oblationem Jehovae.

   30. And of the children of Israel's half, thou shalt take one portion
   of fifty, of the persons, of the beeves, of the asses, and of the
   flocks, of all manner of beasts, and give them unto the Levites, which
   keep the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord.

   30. Et de media parte filiorum Israel capies unam portionem ex
   quinquaginta, ex hominibus, ex bobus, ex asinis, et ex pecoribus, id
   est ex omni jumento: et dabis illa Levitis custodientibus custodiam
   tabernaculi Jehovae.

   31. And Moses and Eleazar the priest did as the Lord commanded Moses.

   31. Et fecit Moses et Eleazar sacerdos quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova
   Mosi.

   32. And the booty, being the rest of the prey which the men of war had
   caught, was six hundred thousand, and seventy thousand, and five
   thousand sheep,

   32. Et fuit praeda, residuum scilicet praedae quam praedati sunt
   milites, ovium sexcenta septuaginta quinque millia,

   33. And threescore and twelve thousand beeves,

   33. Et bovum septuaginta duo milIlia,

   34. And threescore and one thousand asses,

   34. Et asinorum unum et sexaginta millia,

   35. And thirty and two thousand persons in all, of women that had not
   known man by lying with him.

   35. Et animarum hominis e mulieribus qum non cognoverant coitum
   masculi: omnium, inquam, animarum, duo et triginta millia.

   36. And the half, which was the portion of them that went out to war,
   was in number three hundred thousand, and seven and thirty thousand and
   five hundred sheep:

   36. Fuit autem dimidia pars, portio eorum, qui egressi fuerant ad
   militiare, numerus ovium trecenta triginta septem millia et quingentae.

   37. And the Lord's tribute of the sheep was six hundred and threescore
   and fifteen.

   37. Fuit vero census pro Jehova ex ovibus sexcentae septuagintaquinque.

   38. And the beeves were thirty and six thousand, of which the Lord's
   tribute was threescore and twelve.

   38. Et bovum, sex et triginta millia: et census eorum Jehovae, duo et
   septuaginta.

   39. And the asses, were thirty thousand and five hundred, of which the
   Lord's tribute was threescore and one.

   39. Et asinorum triginta millia, et quingenti: census autem eorum
   Jehovae unus et sexaginta:

   40. And the persons were sixteen thousand, of which the Lord's tribute
   was thirty and two persons.

   40. Et animarum hominum sedecim millia: census vero eorum Jehovae, duae
   et triginta animae.

   41. And Moses gave the tribute, which was the Lord's heave-offering,
   unto Eleazar the priest; as the Lord commanded Moses.

   41. Deditque Moses censum oblationis Jehovae ipsi Eleazar sacerdoti,
   quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova Mosi.

   42. And of the children of Israel's half, which Moses divided from the
   men that warred,

   42. Et de dimidia parte filiorum Israel, quam deduxerit Moses a viris
   que militaverant:

   43. (Now the half that pertained unto the congregation was three
   hundred thousand, and thirty thousand, and seven thousand and five
   hundred sheep,

   43. Fuit autem dimidia pars congregationis de ovibus, trecenta et
   triginta septem millia et quingentae.

   44. And thirty and six thousand beeves,

   44. Et bovum sex et triginta millia.

   45. And thirty thousand asses and five hundred,

   45. Et asinorum triginta millia et quingenti.

   46. And sixteen thousand persons,)

   46. Et animarum hominum sedecim millia.

   47. Even of the children of Israel's half, Moses took one portion of
   fifty, both of man and of beast, and gave them unto the Levites, which
   kept the charge of the tabernacle of the Lord; as the Lord commanded
   Moses.

   47. De dimidia, inquam, parte filiorum Israel tulit Moses portionem
   unam e quinquaginta ex hominibus et ex jumentis, et dedit eam Levitis
   custodientibus custodiam tabernaculi, Jehovae, quemadmodum praeceperat
   Jehova Mosi.

   48. And the officers which were over thousands of the host, the
   captains of thousands, and captains of hundreds, came near unto Moses:

   48. Et accesserunt ad, ad Mosen praefecti militum militiae, tribuni et
   centuriones.

   49. And they said unto Moses, Thy servants have taken the sum of the
   men of war which are under our charge, and there lackcth not one man of
   us.

   49. Dixeruntque ad Mosen, Servi tui levarunt (vel, subduxerunt,) summam
   virorum bellatorum qui sunt in manu nostra, et non defuit in nobis
   quisquam.

   50. We have therefore brought an oblation for the Lord, what every man
   hath gotten, of jewels of gold, chains, and bracelets, rings,
   ear-rings, and tablets, to make an atonement for our souls before the
   Lord.

   50. Propterea obtulimus oblationem Jehovae quisque quod invenit, vasa
   aurea, brachiale, et ornamentum manus, annulum in aurem, et
   subligaculum foemineum, ad expiandum animas nostras coram Jehova.

   51. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of them, even all
   wrought jewels.

   51. Et accepit Moses et Eleazar sacerdos aurum ab illis, omnia vasa
   operis.

   52. And all the gold of the offering that they offered up to the Lord,
   of the captains of thousands, and of the captains of hundreds, was
   sixteen thousand seven hundred and fifty shekels.

   52. Fuitque omne aurum oblationis quod obtulerunt Jehovae, sedecim
   millia, septingenti et quinquaginta sicli, a tribunis et centurionibus.

   53. (For the men of war had taken spoil, every man for himself.)

   53. (Viri namque exereitus praedati fuerant quisque sibi.)

   54. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold of the captains of
   thousands and of hundreds, and brought it into the tabernacle of the
   congregation, for a memorial for the children of Israel before the
   Lord.

   54. Accepit inquam Moses et Eleazar sacerdos aurum a tribunis et
   centurionibus, et intulit illud in tabernaculum conventionis, in
   memoriam filiis Israel coram Jehova.


   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses. Amongst the other prerogatives which
   God conferred upon His Church, this one is celebrated, that He armed
   the godly "to execute vengeance upon the heathen, -- to execute upon
   them the judgment that is written," (Psalm 149:7-9) and although the
   Spirit declares that this should happen under the kingdom of Christ,
   still He refers to ancient examples, one of which, well worthy of
   remembrance, is here recorded. The Midianites had organized a wicked
   conspiracy for the destruction of God's people: and God, in undertaking
   to punish this cruel act of theirs, gave a striking proof of His
   paternal favor towards the Israelites; whilst this grace is doubled by
   His constituting them the ministers of his judgment. This passage,
   therefore, shews us how anxious God was for the welfare of His elect
   people, when He so set Himself against their enemies, as if He would
   make common cause in all respects with them. At the same time we must
   observe this additional favor towards them, that although the
   Israelites themselves were not without blame, He still deigned to
   appoint them as judges of the Midianites. Inasmuch, however, as He
   everywhere prohibits His people from indulging the lust of vengeance,
   we must not forget the distinction between men's vengeance and His own.
   He would have His servants, by patiently bearing injuries, overcome
   evil with good; while, at the same time, He by no means abdicates His
   own power, but still reserves to Himself the right of inflicting
   punishment. Nay, Paul, desiring to exhort believers to long-suffering,
   recalls them to the principle, that God takes upon Himself the office
   of avenging. [203] Since, then, God is at liberty to execute vengeance,
   not only by Himself, but also by His ministers, as we have already
   seen, these two things are not inconsistent with each other, that the
   passions of the godly are laid under restraint by the Word, that they
   should not, when injured, seek for vengeance, or retaliate the evils
   they have received, and still that they are the just and legitimate
   executioners of God's vengeance, when the sword is put into their
   hands. It remains, that whosoever is called to this office, should
   punish crime with honest zeal, as the minister of God, and not as
   acting in his own private cause. God here intrusted the office of
   vengeance upon His people, but by no means in order that they might
   indulge the lust of their nature: for their feeling ought to have been
   this, that they should have been ready to pardon the Midianites, [204]
   and still that they should heartily bestir themselves to inflict
   punishment upon them.

   That, whilst God so severely judged the Midianites, he spared the
   Moabites, was for the sake of Lot, who was the founder of their race.
   But I have already frequently reminded my readers that, when God's
   judgments surpass our understanding, we should, in sober humility, give
   glory to His secret, and to us incomprehensible, wisdom: for those who,
   in this respect, seek to know more than is fitting, elevate themselves
   too high, in order to plunge with head-long audacity into a profound
   abyss, in which, at length, all their senses must be overwhelmed. Why
   was He not at liberty to remit the punishment of the Moabites, and at
   the same time to repay to the Midianites the recompense which was their
   due? Besides, it was only for a time that he pardoned the Moabites,
   until their obstinacy should render them inexcusable, after they had
   not only abused his forbearance, but tyrannically afflicted their
   brethren, by whom they had been treated with kindness.

   Moreover, God desired, whilst Moses was still alive, again to testify
   by this final act His love towards His people, in order that they might
   more cheerfully advance to the possession of the promised land: for
   this was no feeble encouragement, when they saw that God spontaneously
   put Himself forward to avenge them. At the same time it was expedient
   for Moses that, at the very moment of his death, he should feel, by a
   fresh instance, what care God took for the welfare of the people. For
   he was able joyfully to leave them in God's keeping, whose hand he had
   so recently seen put forth to fulfill to the utmost His gracious
   purposes towards them. To the same effect were the words, "Thou shalt
   be gathered unto thy people," which were undoubtedly spoken as a
   consolation in death. It was also a reason for making haste; for if the
   dearth of the holy Prophet had been waited for, perhaps the Israelites
   would not have dared to attack, with arms in their hands, a peaceful
   nation, from whom there was no peril or inconvenience impending. But so
   great was the authority of Moses over them, that they were more ready
   to obey his bidding than that of any other person.

   Although it is said indifferently of the reprobate as well as
   believers, that they are gathered or congregated to their fathers by
   death, still this expression shews that men are born for immortality;
   for it would not be appropriate to say this of the brute animals, whose
   death is their final destruction, inasmuch as they are without the hope
   of another life.

   3. And Moses spake unto the people. There is no doubt but that Moses
   delivered the commands which he had received from God; although,
   therefore, it is stated [205] that only ten thousand went forth to the
   war, yet the facts themselves demonstrate that the number, as well as
   the mode of warfare, was prescribed by God. And assuredly it would have
   been inconsiderate of Moses to attack so great a people with so small a
   band; and thus he would have deservedly incurred the penalty of his
   rashness, if he had attempted it of his own accord; still, when God's
   command had preceded, he happily concluded the matter, which had been
   properly and rightly undertaken. Nor can it be questioned but that God
   desired by this test to prove the faith of His people. For, according
   to human apprehension, it was folly to endanger themselves without
   cause; and the objection was obvious that it was by no means advisable,
   when six hundred thousand men were at hand, to restrict to so few the
   office of waging such a perilous war. Just, therefore, as God
   afterwards destroyed the great army of the Midianites by only four
   hundred men under the guidance of Gideon, so also under the hand of
   Moses He sent forth only a single thousand from every tribe for the
   destruction of that nation. The tribe of Zebulon alone could have
   furnished five times as many soldiers as God took from the whole
   people. Thus, then, they proved their faith, when in reliance on the
   aid of God alone, they did not hesitate boldly to rush forward against
   their enemies. And the event itself more fully illustrated God's grace
   than as if they had fought with all their forces, for then it would
   have been believed that the Midianites were overwhelmed by the infinite
   multitude of men. As, therefore, the people testified their obedience
   by prompt compliance, so they experienced in the result that there is
   nothing better than to submit ourselves to God, and to leave the
   prospect of success so completely in His hand, as that our confidence
   may depend solely upon him.

   Lest either of the tribes should boast itself against the others, they
   were each of them commanded to give the same number of soldiers.
   Moreover, Phinehas was sent with them, not so much that he might engage
   personally with the enemy, or be their General, as that he might rule
   and control their minds as God's messenger and interpreter. They were
   to be kept in the fear of God, and to be elevated to the expectation of
   victory, and therefore God's priest was their leader, so that the war
   might be a holy one; and the same was the object of the silver
   trumpets, with which, in obedience to the Lw, as we have elsewhere
   seen, [206] the Levites were accustomed to sound, that it might be
   manifest that their battles were not fought without the will and
   authority of heaven. Amongst "the holy instruments," some commentators,
   in my opinion rightly, include the Ark of the Covenant.

   7. And they warred against the Midianites. It was a signal example of
   obedience, that 12,000 men did not refuse to engage in a war which was
   full of danger, when it was reasonable for them to object that it was
   not right for them to be exposed to butchery, as it were, whilst the
   people sat idly in the camp, who by their great numbers and with little
   trouble would have routed and overcome the enemy. It was therefore no
   common proof of piety, that they obeyed God's command, and sought for
   no pretext to cover their cowardice. God, too, shewed by the result
   that He did not rashly expose His servants to danger; for it is in His
   power to rescue those whom He takes under His protection, from a
   hundred deaths. From hence also we are taught that there is no surer
   means of safety than to follow whither He leads. What Moses afterwards
   adds, tends to render praise to their perseverance, with one exception,
   they were right in killing all the males, even to the kings, whom Moses
   relates to have been slain in the general slaughter; and especially
   that they inflicted punishment on Balaam, who by his cunning and his
   snares, had endeavored to destroy the people of God. They were right,
   too, in spoiling the whole land; nor did they act with less propriety
   and discretion in razing all the cities and towns, which might have
   been a temptation to the timid and inactive to take up their abode
   there; for, as we have seen before, all hindrances were to be taken
   away, so that the people might advance freely and without incumbrance
   into the land of Canaan; else, when there was an opportunity of repose,
   many would have willingly foregone the promised inheritance. Hence the
   cities were consumed by fire, lest they should afford any hold for
   those who were willing to stay. Thus far the selected soldiers
   faithfully performed their duty: in one respect they failed, in that,
   under the impulse either of avarice or lust, they preserved the women
   alive: on which point we shall see more presently.

   11. And they took all the spoil. It was a sign both of their
   disinterestedness and modesty, that they brought the booty, which they
   had taken in the ardor of battle, to Moses and Eleazar; nor was it a
   mere empty and pompous ceremony, as many boastingly parade the wealth
   which they desire to keep to themselves; but their intention was, to
   acquiesce in the determination of Moses as to its distribution. For,
   when Moses soon afterwards allots half of it to the people, they are so
   far from rebelling against his decision, that they do not even murmur.
   It is clear, then, that in this respect they were no less submissive
   than they had been when, at the outset, they took up arms, and boldly
   went forth to battle, whilst the rest were quietly reposing out of the
   reach of the darts.

   14 And Moses was wroth with the officers. A successful issue usually
   obtains pardon for any errors in performance, nay, in a manner covers
   them, so that they are not taken into account; but, although the army
   brought with it many causes of congratulation, still Moses does not
   forbear from severely reproving their single fault. By this example we
   are taught that, whilst we give praise to virtuous actions, we are not
   to approve of anything which deserves reprehension. The anger of Moses
   might appear to us inhumane, when he severely reproves his soldiers
   because they had not treated the female sex with the greatest cruelty;
   but it is not our business to canvass the judgments of God, before
   whose tribunal we must all hereafter stand. Although, therefore, they
   may be repugnant to our own feelings, still we must rest assured that,
   even where they may seem to be excessive, He nevertheless tempers the
   most severe punishments with the most perfect equity; yea, that
   although He may for a time overlook, or at any rate not so severely
   punish, the same sin in the Moabites which He sorely avenged upon the
   Midiantes, there is still a most just cause for this distinction,
   although it may be hidden in His own breast. It is not our part to
   murmur against Him, lest He should absolve Himself by condemning our
   blasphemous audacity and temerity.

   The Israelites sinned, in that, when they were only the ministers of
   God's vengeance, it rested not in their own discretion to relax any
   part of it. And this is worthy of observation, that those who are armed
   with the sword, must not go out of the way on either side one tittle,
   but faithfully execute whatever God prescribes. By the praise which: is
   given to the anger of Moses, the imagination of the Stoics is refuted,
   with whom indifference [207] (apatheia) is the highest of virtues. But
   rather are we to labor that all our affections should proceed from a
   good motive, and that they should be kept under such restraint, that
   they may contain no ebullition of carnal passion, but that spiritual
   zeal may preside in them. Moses, however, gives the reason why the
   women were no more to be spared than the men, viz., because they had
   prostituted themselves in order to lay deadly snares for the
   Israelites. As regards the little ones, the same reasoa did not affect
   them, inasmuch as they were guilty of no crime; yet is it not doubtful
   but that God justly desired that the very name of this wicked and
   irrecoverable nation should be utterly blotted out; just as He
   afterwards gave over to destruction the nations of Canaan, together
   with their offspring. The question, however, arises by what means the
   women, who "had not known a man," were to be distinguished from
   virgins. The Jews, according to their custom, invent a fable [208] in
   reply, whereas it is probable that the decision was only come to on the
   ground of their age.

   19. And do ye abide without the camp seven days. We have elsewhere
   seen, [209] that, if any one had touched a dead body, he was accounted
   unclean. Moses, by now extending the ceremony of expiation to lawful
   homicide, intimates how carefully we ought to abstain from shedding
   human blood. It was required of the Israelites that they should
   strenuously advance through the midst of carnage; but, inasmuch as it
   is in a manner contrary to the order of nature that men should be
   killed by men, as if they were raging against their own bowels, God
   would have some vestiges of humanity preserved even in just
   punishments, so as to put a restraint upon all cruelty in the abstract.
   Nor is it without cause that Scripture, even in commending heroic
   bravery, uses this form of expression, that "they have polluted their
   hands with blood," who have slain any of their enemies, i.e., in order
   that we may abhor all acts of homicide, as being repugnant to the
   preservation of the human race. Although, therefore, the Israelites had
   slain the Midianites not only justly, but by God's command, still, lest
   they should accustom themselves to the indiscriminate shedding of
   blood, they are commanded to purify themselves on the third and the
   seventh day, before they returned to the camp, so that their pollution
   should not infect the people. The reason for purifying the booty was
   different, viz., because the uncleanness of their vessels indicated how
   detestable was this people, whose very utensils, until they were
   purified either by fire or water, defiled every one by the mere touch.
   Lest, however, the soldiers should refuse to obey, or should comply
   unwillingly, Eleazar reminds them that nothing more was required of
   them than the observance of an old injunction. Nor is it to be doubted
   but that Moses designedly resigned the office of teaching to his
   nephew, because the interpretation of the law was hereafter to be
   sought from the mouth of the priest

   25. And the Lord spake unto Moses. A most equitable distribution of the
   booty is here described, in which the law of proportion was so well
   observed that, whilst the soldiers were not defrauded of the reward of
   their labor, at the same time some advantage accrued to the rest of the
   people in whose name the war was carried on. The share of the multitude
   was indeed small, for the same proportion was awarded to the 12,000 as
   to the remaining 600,000. But, since the booty had been already won by
   the soldiers in right of their victory, it ought not to have been a
   cause of complaint to the people who had not borne arms, that they
   received an honorary gift, although it might be of little value. And
   assuredly it would have been a shame that those who remained in the
   camp should be altogether without any part of the spoil, as if they had
   been convicted of cowardice, whereas it did not depend on themselves
   that they had not taken part with their brethren in the conquest of the
   enemy. For it was from no want of courage that they had escaped the
   burden and the perils of war, but they had modestly allowed the general
   glory to be appropriated by a few, because it had so pleased God. But,
   whilst it was just that some of the fruits of the victory should be
   communicated to all, so it. was no less right that the fuller and more
   liberal reward should be received by those who had borne the whole
   brunt of the war.

   It appears to some that David pursued the same rule, when he
   distributed the spoil equally amongst his followers who had gone down
   to the battle, and those who had stood by the baggage. (1 Samuel
   30:24.) In my opinion, however, what David then decided was very
   different; for if the portion of those who remained with the baggage
   had been equal with that of those who were actually engaged, it would
   have been far more advantageous to remain out of the reach of the
   weapons. For, when a battle is fought, only a few men out of a large
   army are generally left with the baggage, and thus half the booty would
   have accrued to a few idlers. The partition, therefore, which is there
   mentioned, must have been an equal distribution to each individual; and
   very justly did David enjoin that those who remained stationed in the
   camp should have a full share of the spoil, lest [210] the condition of
   those should be dissimilar who were under the operation of the same
   rule. But in this case the actual warriors are justly rewarded above
   those who quietly attended to their own domestic cares.

   28. And levy a tribute unto the Lord. God now requires a tribute, or
   holy oblation, out of the spoil from both parties, but in unequal
   portions, the people paying ten times more than the soldiers. There was
   a twofold reason and object for this tribute; for it was not fair that
   the Levites alone should be sent away empty, as if their condition were
   worse than that of the rest, because they were occupied in the service
   of God, and in taking care of the holy things. But the part which He
   assigns to them, God commands to be offered to Himself, that men may
   not only regard equity amongst each other, but that religion may stand
   in the foremost place; for nothing can be more unreasonable than that
   the rights of men should be maintained inviolate, whilst God himself is
   overlooked. In order, then, to testify their piety, the offering was
   enjoined, as if God claimed for Himself the glory of the victory in
   taking this fiftieth and five-hundredth portion. But, inasmuch as He
   has no want of anything, having full satisfaction in Himself alone, the
   Levites are substituted in His stead, that they may receive some reward
   for their ministry.

   Again, we perceive that God dealt more liberally with the soldiers than
   with the rest of the multitude; nor is this a matter of surprise, for,
   since He had laid a greater burden upon them, it was just that they
   should be enriched by more fruits of the victory, for He heaps
   blessings upon blessings according to His pleasure.

   From this distribution we also gather that it depends upon His
   ordinance that some should be richer than others; for, if there were no
   such thing as property, there would be no test of justice and
   integrity.

   37. And the Lord's tribute of the sheep. The greatness of the victory
   is shewn by the result, since such an abundance of cattle could only
   have been collected from a wide and populous country. It is probable
   that it was not very fertile, and consequently only live stock, and not
   corn and wine, are enumerated as amongst their wealth. Still, we may
   conjecture that it was famous for pastures, since barren mountains
   could not have fed so many oxen, and goats, and sheep, and camels;
   besides, it is most evident, from the number of young women, that the
   men who were slain were more in number than their conquerors who had
   been sent to the battle; for suppose they each of them had an unmarried
   daughter, they would have almost three times outnumbered the 12,000
   Israelites. Hence, again, it is manifest that the victory was effected
   by Divine power. It may, however, seem strange that, although the
   nation was almost destroyed, nevertheless their posterity existed some
   little time afterwards, as if new Midianites had been begotten from the
   ashes of their sires. For it was not a very long time that elapsed
   between this slaughter and the time of Gideon, when they again dared
   voluntarily to attack the Israelites, and in reliance on their
   multitude, to rush into the very heart of Canaan; nay, they had already
   brought all the neighboring nations into subjection. How this could
   have happened, since the Scriptures do not inform us, it only remains
   for us to make the conjecture, that many of them, as is often the case
   in a season of confusion, fled elsewhere, and soon afterwards returned
   into the land, which was now unoccupied. For the sudden irruption of
   the Israelites was like a storm which soon passed away; nor was flight
   a difficult thing for this unsettled and wandering nation. It might
   also have been the case, that many immigrants from various quarters
   flowed into the land, when stripped of its inhabitants; or even that
   the Israelites, having performed their work but slackly, sounded the
   recall sooner than they ought, and that God afterwards punished their
   remissness. At any rate, we are taught by this example that the wicked
   sprout up like foul and noxious weeds, so that, though often cut down,
   they soon cover the ground again.

   48. And the officers which were over the thousands. We have here an
   example of signal gratitude, that the leaders of the army, when they
   saw that none of their men were lost, consecrated their spoils of gold
   and silver to the Lord. By the offering of the first-fruits, they had
   already sufficiently testified their piety and obedience; nor, indeed,
   after they had faithfully complied with God's command, could anything
   more have been expected from them; hence does their liberality deserve
   so much the more praise, when they lay themselves under the obligation
   of a new and extraordinary vow. At the same time, Moses magnifies God's
   special blessing in bringing them all back safely to a man from this
   great battle. Surely, since their spoils must have been driven from
   many villages, it was strange that some few of them at least had not
   been slain in their very passage from one place to another. Hence,
   therefore, it was more than ever manifest that the war was thus
   successfully concluded under the guidance of God, who had protected the
   12,000 men. Hence the incredible goodness of God towards his people is
   here celebrated, as well as the pious profession of the officers, when
   it is expressly stated that, having mustered their forces, they had
   found them all safe, so that there could be no doubt nor question about
   the grace of God. In acknowledgment, therefore, of His wondrous power
   in the preservation of the soldiers, they offer as the price of their
   redemption whatever gold and silver they had taken among the spoils.
   Moses records the sum, so that it may more clearly appear that, in the
   performance of this act of homage, it was no trifling amount of gain
   that they despised, for its amount is more than 10,500 livres of French
   money. [211]

   But what becomes of the soldiers? whilst these vows are being paid for
   their safety, they quietly enjoy their plunder: for there is an implied
   comparison here, when Moses, after having praised the centurions and
   tribunes, presently adds the exception, that "the spoil which each man
   had taken was his own." It is, indeed, amazing that the soldiers, as if
   they had conquered by themselves, and for themselves alone, should have
   been so ill-conditioned and mean, as not to imitate this laudable
   example. And, in truth, it often happens, that the multitude indulges
   its meanness without shame, as well because it is ignorant of what true
   nobility is, as because the crowd conceals the disgrace. Meanwhile,
   those in office are reminded to take care, that the higher the dignity
   may be to which they are called, the more eminent should their virtues
   be.

   51. And Moses and Eleazar the priest took the gold. It was fitting that
   this should be added, lest any should suppose that Eleazar made a
   profit by the liberality of others. Moses, therefore, relates, that
   whatever gold was offered, was faithfully laid up as an ornament for
   the sanctuary. When it is said, "for a memorial for the children of
   Israel," it may be taken either actively or passively; viz., either
   that the gift may be a monument of their gratitude, or that it might
   conciliate favor for the people in the eyes of God; as if that offering
   of expiation brought before God, and represented, all those who thus
   professed themselves to be preserved by His grace. I prefer the latter
   sense myself, i.e., that this memorial was set before His eyes, in
   order that God might hereafter also be favorable to His people.

   Numbers 32

   Numbers 32:1-42

   1. Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad had a very great
   multitude of cattle; and when they saw the land of Jazer, and the land
   of Gilead, that, behold, the place was a place for cattle;

   1. Peculium vero multum erat filiis Ruben, et filiis Gad multum
   admodum: qui viderunt terram Jaazer et terram Galaad, et ecce, locus
   ille erat locus peculii.

   2. The children of Gad and the children of Reuben, came and spake unto
   Moses, and to Eleazar the priest, and unto the princes of the
   congregation, saying,

   2. Venerunt igitur filii Gad et filii Ruben, et dixerunt ad Mosen et
   Eleazar sacerdotem, et ad principes congregationis, dicendo:

   3. Ataroth, and Dibon, and Jazer, and Nimrah, and Heshbon, and Elealeh,
   and Shebam, and Nebo, and Beon,

   3. Ataroth, et Dibon, et Jaazer, et Nimrah, et Heshbon, et Elalech, et
   Sebam, et Nebo, et Bebon:

   4. Even the country which the Lord smote before the congregation of
   Israel, is a land for cattle, and thy servants have cattle:

   4. Terra quam percussit Jehova ad congregationem Israel, terra peculii
   est, et servis tuis est peculium.

   5. Wherefore, said they, if we have found grace in thy sight, let this
   land be given unto thy servants for a possession, and bring us not over
   Jordan.

   5. Dixerunt, inquam, si invenimus gratiam in oculis tuis, detur terra
   haec servis tuis in possessionem: ne transire nos facias Jordanem.

   6. And Moses said unto the children of Gad, and to the children of
   Reuben, Shall your brethren go to war, and shall ye sit here?

   6. Respondit autem Moses filiis Gad, et Ruben, Num fratres vestri
   ingredientur pugnam, et vos manebitis hic?

   7. And wherefore discourage ye the heart of the children of Israel from
   going over into the land which the Lord hath given them?

   7. Et quare frangetis cot filiorum Israel, ne transeant ad terram quam
   dedit eis Jehova?

   8. Thus did your fathers, when I sent them from Kadesh-barnea to see
   the land.

   8. Sic fecerunt patres vestri quando misi eos de Cades-barnea ut
   viderent terram istam.

   9. For when they went up unto the valley of Eshcol, and saw the land,
   they discouraged the heart of the children of Israel, that they should
   not go into the land which the Lord had given them.

   9. Ascenderunt namque usque ad vallem Eschol, videruntque terram,
   postea fregerunt cor filiorum Israel, ne ingrederentur terram quam
   dederat eis Jehova.

   10. And the Lord's anger was kindled the same time, and he sware,
   saying,

   10. Unde irata excandescentia Jehovae in die illa, juravit dicendo:

   11. Surely none of the men that came up out of Egypt, from twenty years
   old and upward, shall see the land which I sware unto Abraham, unto
   Isaac, and unto Jacob, because they have not wholly followed me:

   11. Si videbunt homines qui ascenderunt ex AEgypto, a filio viginti
   armorum et supra, terram de qua juravi Abraham, Isaac et Jacob: quia
   non compleverunt ire post me:

   12. Save Caleb the son of Jephunneh the Kenezite, and Joshua the son of
   Nun: for they have wholly followed the Lord.

   12. Praeter Caleb filium Jephune Cenezaeum, et Josue filium Nun, quia
   compleverunt ire post Jehovam.

   13. And the Lord's anger was kindled against Israel, and he made them
   wander in the wilderness forty years, until all the generation that had
   done evil in the sight of the Lord was consumed.

   13. Et irata est excandescentia Jehovae in Israelem, vagarique fecit
   eos in deserto quadraginta annis, donec consumeretur tota ilia
   generatio quae fecerat malum in oculis Jehovah.

   14. And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead, an increase of
   sinful men, to augment yet the fierce anger of the Lord toward Israel.

   14. Ecce autem surrexistis pro patribus vestris, accessio hominum
   sceleratorum, ut adderetis adhuc ad iram excandescentiae Jehovae contra
   Israelem.

   15. For if ye turn away from after him, he will yet again leave them in
   the wilderness; and ye shall destroy all this people.

   15. Si aversi fueritis ut non eatis post eum, tum addet adhuc deserere
   illum ipsum in deserto, et perdetis universum populum hunc.

   16. And they came near unto him, and said, We will build sheepfolds
   here for our cattle, and cities for our little ones;

   16. Et accesserunt ad eum, ac dixerunt, Caulas pecudum aedificabimus
   peculio nostro hic, et urbes parvulis nostris:

   17. But we ourselves will go ready armed before the children of Israel,
   until we have brought them unto their place: and our litttle ones shall
   dwell in the fenced cities, because of the inhabitants of the land.

   17. Nos vero accincti erimus armis, festinantes ante filios Israel,
   donec introduxerimus eos ad locum suum: et manebunt parvuli nostri in
   urbibus munitis propier habitatores terrae.

   18. We will not return unto our houses, until the children of Israel
   have inherited every man his inheritance:

   18.: Non reverietour ad domos nostras, donec possideant filii Israel
   quisque haereditatem suam.

   19. For we will not inherit with them on yonder side Jordan, or
   forward; because our inheritance is fallen to us on this side Jordan
   eastward.

   19. Non enim haereditatem accipiemus cum eis trans Jordanem et ultra:
   quod evenerit haereditas nostra nobis citra Jordanem ad Orientem.

   20. And Moses said unto them, If ye will do this thing, if ye will go
   armed before the Lord to war,

   20. Et dixit illis Moses, Si feceritis hoc, si accinxeritis vos armis
   coram Jehova ad bellum:

   21. And will go all of you armed over Jordan before the Lord, until he
   hath driven out his enemies from before him,

   21. Et transierint ex vobis omnes accincti armis ipsum Jordanem ante,
   Jehovam, donec expulerit inimicos suos a facie sua,

   22. And the land be subdued before the Lord; then afterward ye shall
   return, and be guiltless before the Lord, and before Israel; and this
   land shall be your possession before the Lord.

   22. Et subjiciatur terra ilia coram Jehova: postea reveriemini, et
   eritis absoluti a Jehova, et Israele: eritque terra ista vobis in
   possessionem coram Jehova.

   23. But if ye will not do so, behold, ye have sinned against the Lord:
   and be sure your sin will find you out.

   23. Quod si non feceritis ita, ecce, peccastis Jehovae, et perpendite
   peccatum vestrum quod invenient vos.

   24. Build you cities for your little ones, and folds for your sheep;
   and do that which hath proceeded out of your mouth.

   24. AEdificate vobis ergo civitates pro parvulis vestris, et caulas
   ovibus vestris, et quod egressum est ex ore vestro, facietis.

   25. And the children of Gad, and the children of Reuben, spake unto
   Moses, saying, Thy servants will do as my lord commandeth.

   25. Et dixerunt filii Gad, et filii Reuben ad Mosen, dicendo: Servi tui
   facient quemadmodum dominus meus praecepit.

   26. Our little ones, our wives, our flocks, and all our cattle, shall
   be there in the cities of Gilead;

   26. Parvuli nostri, uxores nostrae, pecora nostra, et omnia jumenta
   erunt ibi in urbibus Galaad.

   27. But thy servants will pass over, every man armed for war, before
   the Lord to battle, as my lord saith.

   27. Servi autem tui transibunt omnes accincti armis ad militiam coram
   Jehova ad bellum, quemadmodum dominus meus loquitur.

   28. So concerning them Moses commanded Eleazar the priest, and Joshua
   the son of Nun, and the chief fathers of the tribes of the children of
   Israel:

   28. Et praecepit de eis Moses ipsi Eleazar sacerdoti, et Josue filio
   Nun, et principibus patrum tribuum filiorum Israel:

   29. And Moses said unto them, If the children of Gad, and the children
   of Reuben, will pass with you over Jordan, every man armed to battle,
   before the Lord, and the land shall be subdued before you; then ye
   shall give them the land of Gilead for a possession:

   29. Et dixit illis, Si transierint filii Gad et filii Ruben vobiscum
   Jordanem, omnes accincti armis ad bellum coram Jehova, et subjecta
   fuerit terra coram vobis, dabiris eis terram Galaad in possessionem:

   30. But if they will not pass over with you armed, they shall have
   possessions among you in the land of Canaan.

   30. Quod si non transierint accincti armis vobiscum, tum possessionem
   habebunt in medic vestri in terra Chenaan.

   31. And the children of Gad, and the children of Reuben, answered,
   saying, As the Lord hath said unto thy servants, so will we do.

   31. Et responderunt filii Gad et Ruben, dicendo: Quod dixit Jehova
   servis tuis, sic faciemus.

   32. We will pass over armed before the Lord into the land of Canaan,
   that the possession of our inheritance on this side Jordan may be ours.

   32. Nos transibimus accincti armis coram Jehova in terram Chenaan, ut
   vobiscum sit possessic haereditatis nostra citra Jordanem.

   33. And Moses gave unto them, even to the children of Gad, and to the
   children of Reuben, and unto half the tribe of Manasseh the son of
   Joseph, the kingdom of Sihon king of the Amorites, and the kingdom of
   Og king of Bashan, the land, with the cities thereof in the coasts,
   even the cities of the country round about.

   33. Dedit itaque illis Moses, filiis Gad, et filiis Ruben, et dimidiae
   tribui Manasse filii Joseph, regnum Sihon regis Amorrhaei, et regnum Og
   regis Basan, terram cum urbibus suis, cum terminis, urbes terra per
   circuitum.

   34. And the children of Gad built Dibon, and Ataroth, and Aroer,

   34. Et redificaverunt filii Gad Dibon, et Ataroth, et Aroer,

   35. And Atroth, Shophan, and Jaazer, and Jogbehah,

   35. Et Atroth, Sopham, et Jaazer, et Jogbehal,

   36. And Beth-nimrah, and Beth-haran, fenced cities; and folds for
   sheep.

   36. Et Beth-nimrah, et Beth-haran, urbes munitas et caulas ovium.

   37. And the children of Reuben built Heshbon, and Elealeh, and
   Kirjathaim,

   37. Filii vero Ruben aedificaverunt Hesbon, et Eleale, et Ciriathaim,

   38. And Nebo, and Baal-meon, (their names being changed,) and Shibmah:
   and gave other names unto the cities which they builded.

   38. Et Nebo, et Baal-meon versis nominibus, et Sibmah: et vocaverunt
   nominibus nomina urbium quas aedificaverant.

   39. And the children of Machir the son of Manasseh went to Gilead, and
   took it, and dispossessed the Amorite which was in it.

   39. Perrexerunt autem filii Machir, filii Manasse in Galaad,
   acceperuntque eam, et expulerunt Amorrhaeum qui erat in ca.

   40. And Moses gave Gilead unto Machir the son of Manasseh; and he dwelt
   therein.

   40. Itaque dedit Moses Galaad ipsi Machir filio Manasse, et habitavit
   in ea.

   41. And Jair the son of Manasseh went and took the small towns thereof,
   and called them Havoth-jair.

   41. Jair praeterea filius Manasse prorectus erat, et acceperat vicos
   eorum, et vocavit eos Havoth-Jair.

   42. And Nobah went and took Kenath, and the villages thereof, and
   called it Nobah, after his own name.

   42. Nobah similiter profectus erat, et ceperat Cenah et villas ejus:
   vocavitque eam Nobah secundum nomen suum.


   1. Now the children of Reuben and the children of Gad. In this
   narrative we behold, as in a glass, that whilst each individual is but
   too attentive to his own private interests, he forgets what is just and
   right. Those, indeed, who seek their own advantage, do not reflect that
   they are doing injury to others; but it is impossible for them to avoid
   seeking more than is their due, and preferring themselves to others;
   and thus they sin against that rule of charity, that we should not seek
   our own. The sons of Gad and Reuben, who had a great quantity of
   cattle, see a tract of rich and fertile land; self-interest takes
   possession of them, so that it does not occur to them that they were
   under an obligation to their brethren not to covet for themselves
   anything peculiar, or separate from them. Nevertheless, there was a
   specious pretext for this, whereby their eyes were blinded, viz., that
   nothing was taken away from the others, but rather that so much
   addition was made; for by these means the whole country on the other
   side of Jordan continued to be theirs; and, besides, they were rather
   relieved of an inconvenience than exposed to a loss; since the progress
   of their expedition would be less difficult, if the body of persons,
   who were charged with the cattle, should stay there, and thus should
   cease to be an incumbrance to the army, which would be in lighter
   condition for advancing. Their association, however, for the war had
   been established by God, and bound them by an indissoluble tie not to
   desert the rest of the people: whilst it was also a solemn duty
   (religio) imposed upon them not to alter the bounds of the inheritance
   promised by God. The land of Canaan was assigned to the whole race of
   Abraham, in which they were to be enclosed, and to inhabit it as a
   peculiar world, the tribes of Gad and Reuben now transgress those
   limits, and, at the same time disunite themselves from the body of the
   Church, as if they desired to be emancipated from God. Hence ought we
   to be the more on our guard, lest we should go astray after our own
   lusts. And when Moses says, that they saw, or considered, the land, let
   us learn to beware lest our eyes, by unlawful looks, should lead us
   into snares, and blind our minds; and thus that our senses should be so
   deceived by the envenomed sweetness, as that reason and equity should
   be utterly overthrown.

   The Hebrew word, [212] which we have rendered peculium, signifies not
   only cattle and herds, but also flocks of sheep. Almost all the
   Israelites were indeed possessors of cattle; but we gather from the
   words of Moses, that these two tribes were especially rich in them;
   perhaps, because the district which they inhabited in Egypt, being more
   suited for pasture, had invited them to apply themselves more earnestly
   to that mode of life, which was common to all, and had been handed down
   to them by their fathers; for it is not probable that they had thus
   surpassed the rest in this respect, during the course of their march.

   2. The children of Gad and the children of Reuben came. Their request
   was apparently a reasonable one, that, since God had driven out the
   inhabitants of the land, and its fertility invited them to dwell there,
   the possession of these empty and deserted fields should not be denied
   them. Their modesty also was praiseworthy, in that they neither detach
   themselves from the people, nor seditiously and violently seize upon
   the places which were so suitable for them; but seek to obtain them by
   the permission of Moses and the elders, as if they submitted their
   cause to their decision. But as I have just said, their private
   interest had so laid hold of their minds, that the main point did not
   occur to them, viz., that the land of Canaan was set before them all,
   in order that they might dwell together there separate from heathen
   nations; and, again, that it was unjust for them not only to enjoy
   repose, whilst the others were fighting, but also to be settled in an
   assured and peaceable habitation, while the ten tribes were still
   advancing to the conquest of the promised land.

   6. And Moses said unto the children of Gad. So sharp and severe a
   reproof shews us the greatness of the wrong: for neither did
   inconsiderate warmth carry away Moses into such violent anger, nor did
   he fall into error, so as to deliver his opinion on a point which he
   did not well understand. He knew, therefore, what the sons of Gad and
   Reuben asked; and hence he inveighed against them thus vehemently,
   because they desired to lacerate the body of the Church by this wicked
   severance. He begins by expostulating with them with regard to their
   sinful and unreasonable covetousness, in that they sought to indulge in
   idleness, when their brethren were about to march through a hostile
   land; for they were possessed of no rightful superiority, so as to
   throw upon the others all the labors, perils, and burdens of the war.
   Since, therefore, God had imposed the same condition upon all, [213] it
   was not right that part of them should be exempted from it, as if by
   privilege. More severely, however, is their ingratitude and
   perverseness towards God chastised, than their injustice towards their
   brethren, whilst he alleges to their reproach, that thus the hearts of
   the children of Israel would be broken, [214] so that they wouht refuse
   to obey the call of God.

   8. Thus did your fathers. He amplifies their crime by reference to
   their continued perverseness: for so far is the imitation of ungodly
   parents from being an excuse for their children, that it rather doubles
   their guilt. Thus also does Stephen allege against the Jews of his
   days, their persevering in the sins of their fathers; as if he had
   cried out against them, that they were "the bad eggs of bad birds."

   "Ye stiff-necked (he says) and uncircumcised in heart and ears, ye do
   always resist the Holy Ghost: as your fathers did, so do ye." (Acts
   7:51.)

   So also the Prophet, when he is exhorting their posterity to obedience,
   recalls these same circumstances to their memory:

   "Harden not your hearts, as in the provocation, and as in the day of
   temptation in the wilderness, when your fathers tempted me. Forty years
   long was I grieved with this generation," etc.
   (Psalm 95:8-10.)

   It is not without cause that Moses now complains that there was no end
   or limit to their impiety, whilst the sons inherited their fathers'
   iniquity, and ceased not to resist God: and, in order that the
   similarity and affinity of their crime may be more apparent, he reviews
   their history at some length. He does not, however compare the
   Reubenites and Gadites to the whole people, but to the ten spies, from
   whom the sedition arose, because, as far as in them lay, they turned
   aside the people from the right way. Secondly, he connects with this
   the punishment which ensued, that, at least, he might inspire them with
   terror, since it was hardly to be expected that they would amend of
   their own accord. He reminds them, therefore, that, when God so
   severely dealt with their fathers, He had given them a signal proof
   that their descendants would not be unpunished, unless they were
   teachable and submissive. The expression is remarkable, "Because they
   fulfilled not after me;" [215] whereby he signifies that there is
   nothing praiseworthy in the most vigorous course, unless men persevere
   even to the goal. And, although this had happened forty years ago,
   still, inasmuch as the vengeance which God had threatened had been
   before their eyes even to that day, it behoved them to be just as much
   affected by it, as if they saw the hand of God still stretched forth.
   For, whenever any died in the desert, so often did God set His seal to
   His vengeance, lest it should be at any time buried in oblivion. [216]
   If, then, God had been so wroth with the multitude in general, how much
   less should the instigators themselves escape?

   14. And, behold, ye are risen up in your fathers' stead. He signifies
   that, by their evil doings, they were "filling up the measure" of their
   fathers, as Jesus spoke of the Jews of His own time. In this sense he
   calls them an addition (accessio,) which word I take to mean a climax
   (cumulus.) For their translation is a poor one, who render it
   education, or offspring, or foster-children. With the Hebrews, trvvt,
   [217] tarbuth, is literally an increase, or multiplication; and thus is
   applied to usury. This passage, however, requires that it should be
   explained as a heap, as much as to say that a new body of persons were
   springing up afresh, who carried impiety to its very height. In a word,
   he intimates that fuel was added to the fire which was now smouldering,
   whereby a new flame was excited: for he says that they were furnishing
   materials for God's wrath, so that it should burst forth more and more
   against the whole people.

   16. And they came near tinto him, and said. It is probable that they
   returned after having held a consultation: and now, -- when they had
   considered what they ought to do, before promising what they had not
   previously thought of, -- they assent to the decision of Moses, in
   accordance with their general opinion. From their reply itself we
   gather how usefully the severity of Moses had influenced their minds.
   If he had dealt with them with greater mildness and gentleness, his
   kindness would perhaps have been received with contempt. It was more
   profitable, therefore, that their stubborn hearts should be smitten
   with shame and fear, in order that they might lay aside their
   rebelliousness. Still, they do not altogether abandon their request,
   but devise a middle course, whereby, whilst they do not forsake their
   brethren, they may still occupy the land. They promise, then, to
   accompany them throughout the whole expedition, and to unite with them
   in the war; nay, to be the first to undergo danger, and expose
   themselves to the attacks of the enemy, provided a settled abode should
   be granted them for their families and their herds. Thus they would be
   exempt from guilt, since the rest would not be held back by their bad
   example, nor the strength of the people for carrying on the war be
   diminished; in one respect only they would have the advantage, that, by
   depositing their wives and children in a peaceful spot, they would have
   the opportunity of improving their domestic finances.

   20. And Moses said unto them. Moses might seem to err on the side of
   excessive good-nature, in that he extends the boundaries prescribed by
   God, in complying with their wish. For, since their inheritance had
   been promised them in the land of Canaan, they ought to have been
   contented with that as their abode; nor was it allowable for Moses to
   make any alteration in the Divine decree. There is also another thing
   no less inconsistent, that in a point of so much perplexity, Moses does
   not, as usual, consult God, but gives an immediate answer, which
   indirectly overthrows the previous ordinance of God. And, in truth,
   their desire was by no means excusable, since it would have never
   entered their minds, if they had borne in memory the covenant of God,
   and had been satisfied with this goodness: since it cannot be but that
   the flesh should be constantly running riot, unless kept under
   restraint by the calling of God. But God, who knows how to bring light
   out of darkness, not only pardoned their error, but takes occasion also
   to extend His liberality. Thus the land of Bashan, and its
   neighborhood, were added to the former boundaries. At the same time,
   however, He shewed on the other hand how much better it would have been
   for them to have been kept together, so that they might have mutually
   protected each other, and dwelt securely in their appointed habitation.
   And, after the lapse of a long period, the Reubenites and Gadites
   learnt from experience that they had been too hasty in wishing for the
   land which they obtained; nevertheless, through God's indulgence, that
   which might justly have been injurious to them, turned out for their
   advantage.

   We may gather, however, from the result, that Moses was guilty of no
   rashness in his interference with the ordinance, of God, both because
   he commands that which he now determines to be ratified and maintained
   after his death; and when, in the book of Joshua, it is recorded that
   the several tribes had their inheritance assigned to them, this country
   beyond Jordan is excepted, as having been granted by Moses to the
   tribes of Reuben and Gad and half of Manasseh. Hence it is evident that
   his decision was approved by God. Moreover, since he is there often
   honored with the title of "servant of God," we are taught that nothing
   was done by him in this matter without the authority of God, and the
   guidance of His Spirit. Neither is it at random that he here so often
   makes use of God's name, but rather does he thus imply that whatever he
   does is suggested by Him.

   23. But if ye will not do so. He makes a solemn protestation that they
   will deal wickedly, if they break their promise: and at the same time
   denounces punishment against them, as if he were summoning them before
   the tribunal of God. But, although he speaks conditionally of that
   particular engagement, whereby the two tribes had voluntarily bound
   themselves, still we may derive from his words the general doctrine,
   that, unless we abide by our promises, God will always be the avenger
   of fraud and treachery. The expression, "Sin will find you out," is
   more emphatic than as if he had simply said, You shall not escape God's
   hand; for the meaning of it is that vengeance is so connected with sin,
   that it cannot be severed from it. Thus, in Genesis 4:7, it is said,
   "Sin lieth at the door," to lay hold at length of the guilty. For, such
   is our propensity to sin, that we too often find from experience that
   we are encouraged to audacity by God's forbearance, whilst we think
   that we have escaped, if He makes as though He saw us not for a time.

   28. So concerning them Moses commanded. Moses annexes these conditions
   to his decision, lest, when the Reubenites and their companions had
   performed their military tasks:, they should be falsely alleged to have
   passed over Jordan for the purpose of seeking a new home; whilst at the
   same time, if they should deceive the other tribes, he provided that
   their cowardice and deceit should not profit them. In short, if they
   assisted their brethren in pursuance of their agreement, he commands
   that the territory, which he now grants them, should always remain
   theirs; but, if they departed from their promise, he would have them
   forced against their will to participate in the common allotment. For
   he does not assign them this portion in the midst of Canaan as a reward
   for their inertness, in case they should stay behind; but signifies
   that they should be forcibly and authoritatively carried onwards, so as
   to be subject to their brethren under all circumstances; since it, was
   not lawful for them to consult their own separate interests.

   In laying down rules for the division of the land, as if it were soon
   to happen, he encourages the minds of all to confidence, so that they
   should more cheerfully hasten to pass over; as if the victory were not
   only already in their hands, but that the fruits of it were soon to be
   enjoyed.

   33. And Moses gave unto them. We must understand that Moses gave it in
   such sort, as that, relying on God's command, he laid down an
   inviolable law. For, although it is not expressly stated that God
   interposed His authority, still His subsequent approbation fully
   assures us of it. So also, although no mention is made of Eleazar and
   the elders, still it is certain that they were not passed over, but
   that they were united with him in the decision; especially since the
   case had been brought before them by the sons of Gad and Reuben, (ver.
   2.) There is only an implied contrast between the old covenant which
   God had made with Abraham, and this new and special privilege,
   wherewith He condescended to enrich His people.

   At first only the two tribes had been named; half the tribe of Manasseh
   is now added, inasmuch as the descendants of Machir, and Jair, and
   Noball, who were all of the family of Manasseh, had seized upon certain
   cities, and men. The rendering which some give, as if they [218] had
   obtained these victories after Moses had permitted the Reubenites and
   Gadites to inhabit this side of Jordan, does not appear to me suitable;
   but rather the reason is given why that portion is excepted, which came
   to the sons of Manasseh, viz., because they were not to be defrauded of
   the lands which they had separately acquired. Nor is it probable, that,
   when the country beyond Jordan had been given to others, they
   afterwards made their incursion so as to appropriate what did not
   belong to them. The order of the narrative does not make this
   necessary; for it is common with the Hebrews to transpose the order of
   occurrences, especially when something before omitted is incidentally
   added to give a reason for what is done. If, however, any should prefer
   to believe that they were attracted by the advantage that presented
   itself, I will not pertinaciously contend the point.

   But how does it accord that cities are said to be built which were
   still standing undestroyed? for we have already seen that the people
   who had taken them, were dwelling in them. I reply that, inasmuch as it
   seldom happens that cities are taken without the walls being destroyed,
   it is not unreasonable that the restoration of these should be called
   building. It was necessary that the cities should be fortified lest the
   unarmed multitude [219] should be exposed to the assaults of every
   enemy. To this end they repaired what had been thrown down, and thus in
   a manner renewed the cities which were a mass of ruins.

   A Repitition of the same History

   Deuteronomy 3

   Deuteronomy 3:12-20

   12. And this land, which we possessed at that time, from Aroer, which
   is by the river Arnon, and half mount Gilead, and the cities thereof,
   gave I unto the Reubenites, and to the Gadites

   12. Et hanc terram possedimus eo tempore ab Aroer, qum sita erat ad
   torrentem Arnon: et dimidium montis Galaad, et urbes ejus dedi
   Rubenitis et Gadiris.

   13. And the rest of Gilead, and all Bashan, being the kingdom of Og,
   gave I unto the half-tribe of Manasseh; all the region of Argob, with
   all Bashan, which was called the land of giants.

   13. Residuum vero Galaad, et universam Basan regni Og dedi dimidiae
   tribui Manasse, et omnem regionem Argob, totam Basan qum vocabatur
   terra gigantum.

   14. Jair the son of Manasseh took all the country of Argob, unto the
   coasts of Geshuri and Maachathi, and called them after his own name,
   Bashan-havoth-jair, unto this day.

   14. Jair filius Manasse cepit omnem regionem Argob usque ad terminum
   Gesuri et Maachathi: et vocavit eas secundum nomen suum Basan Havoth
   Jair usque ad diem istam.

   15. And I gave Gilead unto Machir.

   15. Porro ipsi Machir dedi Galaad:

   16. And unto the Reubenites, and unto the Gadites, I gave from Gilead
   even unto the river Arnon, half the valley, and the border, even unto
   the river Jabbok, which is the border of the children of Ammon;

   16. Rubenitis vero et Gaditis dedi Galaad, usque ad torrentem Arnon,
   medium torrentis, et terminum: et usque ad Jabboc torrentem terminum
   filiorum Ammon:

   17. The plain also, and Jordan, and the coast thereof, from Chinnereth
   even unto the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, under Ashdoth-pisgah
   eastward.

   17. Et planitiem, et Jordanem, et terminum a Chinnereth usque ad mare
   planitiei, mare salis, sub effusionibus aquarum collis ad orientem.

   18. And I commanded you at that time, saying, The Lord your God hath
   given you this land to possess it: ye shall pass over armed before your
   brethren the children of Israel, all that are meet for the war.

   18. Pracepique vobis co tempore dicendo, Jehova Deus vester dedit vobis
   terram istam, ut possideatis eam, accineti armis transibitis ante
   fratres vestros filios Israel, quotquot robusti estis.

   19. But your wives, and your little ones, and your cattle, (for I know
   that ye have much cattle,) shall abide in your cities which I have
   given you;

   19. Tantummodo uxores vestrae, et parvuli vestri, et pecudes vestrae
   (novi quod pecora multa sint vobis) remanebunt in urbibus vestris quas
   dedi vobis:

   20. Until the Lord have given rest unto your brethren, as well as unto
   you, and until they also possess the land which the Lord your God hath
   given them beyond Jordan: and then shall ye return every man unto his
   possession, which I have given you.

   20. Donec requiem dederit Jehova fratribus vestris sicut vobis, et
   possideant ipsi etiam terram, quam Jehova Deus vester dat eis trans
   Jordanem: tunc revertemini singuli ad possessionem suam quam dedi
   vobis.


   12. And this land, which we possessed at that time. In this passage
   Moses confirms his decision, that the possession of the country beyond
   Jordan should be insured to the Reubenites and Gadites, and half the
   tribe of Manasseh. For, since it had fallen to them exceptionally, the
   matter might be brought into controversy with posterity. Lest, then,
   any should disturb them, he again declares that they were the rightful
   possessors of that district. Moreover, inasmuch as the very gift of it
   might be called in question, since it was situated outside the bounds
   of the inheritance promised by God, Moses anticipates this objection
   also, asserting that God had not in vain given it to be possessed by
   His people. Hence it follows that the right of inhabiting it was
   conferred upon them. Lest, then, so unequal a partition should be made
   a subject of contention, he marks out their boundaries on every side,
   as though he set up the authority of God as a wall and rampart against
   any who should presume to invade it.

   With reference to the names of the places, the Dead Sea is called the
   Sea of Salt, and the Lake of Genesera or Gennesareth, Chinnereth. As to
   the "outpourings of the hill," translators are not agreed; for some
   consider Ashdoth-Pisgah to be the proper name of a city. [220] I
   prefer, however, to take the word "outpourings" (effusionum)
   appellatively, not for fountains and streams, but for the root (of the
   hill) where the ground by a gentle descent seems in a manner to pour
   itself forth. We shall presently see that Pisgah was one of the summits
   of Mount Abarim.

   18. And I commanded you at that time. This address is directed only to
   those to whom an inheritance was given on the other side of Jordan; but
   Moses declares that he had introduced an agreement that the two tribes
   and a half should not enjoy their possession until they had
   accommpanied their brethren in the subjugation of the land of Canaan.
   He says, therefore, that he had given them a place, not where they were
   at once to settle themselves, but where they might deposit their wives
   and cattle, until the whole people were peaceably established in their
   land.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [220] 'sdt hphsgh A.V. "Ashdoth-Pisgah;" marg., "The springs of Pisgah,
   or, of the hill." The LXX. in like manner only substitutes Greek
   letters for the Hebrew, treating both words as proper names. But when
   the same words occur at the close of the next chapter, our translators
   have placed their previous marginal translation in their text, and the
   LXX. instead of Phasga have ten laxeuten, as though phsgh were an
   appellative, from phsg to cut. In construing 'sdt as a noun, from 'sd
   and rendering it effusions, C. followed S.M., as also in putting the
   hill for Pisgah. Our translators and Luther have agreed in rendering
   the former word springs, when it occurs in Joshua 10:40, and 12:8;
   whilst the LXX. and Diodati have treated it as a proper name in both
   those texts. -- W

   Deuteronomy 4

   Deuteronomy 4:41-43

   41. Then Moses severed three cities on this side Jordan, toward the
   sun-rising;

   41. Tunc separavit Moses tres urbes trans Jordanem ad exortum solis:

   42. That the slayer might flee thither, which should kill his neighbor
   unawares, and hated him not in times past; and that, fleeing unto one
   of these cities, he might live:

   42. Ut fugeret illuc homicida qui occidisset proximum suum nesciens,
   (vel, per errorem, vel, per incogitantiam,) quem non odisset ab heri et
   nudiustertius: ut fugeret ad unam ex urbibus istis, et viveret.

   43. Namely, Bezer in the wilderness, in the plain country of the
   Reubenites; and Ramoth in Gilead, of the Gadites; and Golan in Bashan,
   of the Manassites.

   43. Bezer in deserto, in terra planitiei a Rubenitis: Ramoth Galaad a
   Gaditis, et Golan in Basan a Manasse.


   God had destined, as we have before seen, [221] six cities for refuge,
   in case any one had killed a man, provided he could prove his innocence
   before the judges. As to the three which He had appointed on the other
   side of Jordan, Moses records that he had faithfully performed what God
   had commanded. Hence it appears that, although he could not immediately
   comply with God's command to its full extent, still he did not wait
   until the three other cities could be added; but that, as far as
   circumstances permitted, he discharged his duty. Hence let us learn
   that, even when we cannot at once entirely carry out what God commands
   us to do, we are still to be by no means idle. For nothing but sheer
   laziness stands in our way, unless we speedily commence at God's
   command what it is His will to finish and accomplish by the hands of
   others.

   Numbers 33

   Numbers 33:1-56

   1. These are the journeys of the children of Israel, which went forth
   out of the land of Egypt with their armies, under the hand of Moses and
   Aaron.

   1. Istae sunt profectiones filiorum Israel, qui egressi sunt e terra
   Egypti, per exercitus suos, per manum Mosis et Aharon.

   2. And Moses wrote their goings out according to their journeys by the
   commandment of the Lord: and these are their journeys according to
   their goings out.

   2. Scripsit autem Moses egressus eorum per profectiones eorum juxta
   sermonem Jehovae: istae, inquam, sunt profectiones eorum per egressus
   eorum.

   3. And they departed from Rameses in the first month, on the fifteenth
   day of the first month; on the morrow after the passover the children
   of Israel went out with an high hand in the sight of all the Egyptians.

   3. Profecti sunt igitur Ramesse mense primo, decimaquinta dic mensis
   primi, postera dic Phase egressi sunt filii Israel in manu excelsa in
   oculis omnium Egyptiorum.

   4. (For the Egyptians buried all their first-born, which the Lord had
   smitten among them: upon their gods also the Lord executed judgments.)

   4. (Egyptii autem interim sepeliebant quos percusserat Jehova ex eis,
   omnem primogenitum et in diis eorum fecerat Jehova judicia.)

   5. And the children of Israel removed from Rameses, and pitched in
   Succoth.

   5. Profecti sunt, inquam, filii Israel e Ramesse, ct castrametati sunt
   in Suchoth.

   6. And they departed from Succoth, and pitched in Etham, which is in
   the edge of the wilderness.

   6. Profecti autem de Suchoth, castrametati sunt in Etham, qum est in
   extremo deserti.

   7. And they removed from Etham, and turned again unto Pihahiroth, which
   is before Baal-zephon: and they pitched before Migdol.

   7. Et profecti de Etham, reversi sunt in Phihahiroth, qui est ante
   Baal-sephon, et castrametati sunt ante Migdol.

   8. And they departed from before Pihahiroth, and passed through the
   midst of the sea into the wilderness, and went three days' journey in
   the wilderness of Etham, and pitched in Marah.

   8. Profecti vero de Phi-hahiroth, transierunt per medium maris in
   desertum: et ambulaverunt viam trium dictum per desertum Etham, et
   castrametati sunt in Marah.

   9. And they removed from Marah, and came unto Elim: and in Elim were
   twelve fountains of water, and threescore and ten palm-trees; and they
   pitched there.

   9. Profecti vero de Marah venerunt in Elim: in Elim vero erant duodecim
   fontes aquarum, et septuaginta palmae, et castrametati sunt illic.

   10. And they removed from Elim, and encamped by the Red Sea.

   10. Et profecti ex Elim, castrametati sunt juxta mare Suph.

   11. And they removed from the Red Sea, and encamped in the wilderness
   of Sin.

   11. Profecti autem e marl Suph, castrametati sunt in deserto Sin.

   12. And they took their journey out of the wilderness of Sin, and
   encamped in Dophkah.

   12. Et profecti e deserto Sin, castrametati sunt in Dopheah.

   13. And they departed from Dophkah, and encamped in Alush.

   13. Profecti autem e Dopheal:, castrametati sunt in Alus.

   14. And theyremoved from Alush, and encamped at Rephidim, where was no
   water for the people to drink.

   14. Et profecti ex Alus, castrametati sunt in Rephidim, ubi non erant
   aqum populo ad bibendum.

   15. And they departed from Rephidim, and pitched in the wilderness of
   Sinai.

   15. Ideo profecti e Rephidim, castrametati sunt in deserto Sinai.

   16. And they removed from the desert of Sinai, and pitched at
   Kibroth-hattaavah.

   16. Profecti autem e deserto Sinai, castrametati sunt in
   Cibroth-Hathaavah.

   17. And they departed from Kibroth-hattaavah, and encamped at Hazeroth.

   17. Et profecti ex Cibroth-Hathaavah, castrametati sunt in Haseroth.

   18. And they departed from Hazeroth, and pitched in Rithmah.

   18. Et profecti de Hastroth, castrametati sunt in Rithmah.

   50. And the Lord spake unto Moses in the plains of Moab, by Jordan near

   50. Loquutus est autem Jehova ad Mosen in campestribus Moab, juxta
   Jordanem Jericho, dicendo:

   51. Speak unto the children of Israel, and say unto them, When ye are
   passed over Jordan into the land of Canaan;

   51. Alloquere filios Israel, et dicas eis, Quum transieritis Jordanem
   ad terram Chenaan.

   52. Then ye shall drive out all the inhabitants of the land from before
   you,

   52. Expellite omnes habitatores terrte a facie vestra,

   53. And ye shall dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell
   therein: for I have given you the land to possess it.

   53. Expelletis, inquam, habitatores terrae, et habitabitis in ca, vobis
   enim dedi terram, ut cant possideatis.

   54. And ye shall divide the land by lot for an inheritance among your
   families; and to the more ye shall give the more inheritance, and to
   the fewer ye shall give the less inheritance: every man's inheritance
   shall be in the place where his lot falleth; according to the tribes of
   your fathers ye shall inherit.

   54. Possidebitis autem terram illam per sortem, per familias vestras:
   pluribus multiplicabitis haereditMem eorum, et paucioribus diminuatis
   haereditatem eorum: in loco in quo egredietur illi sors, erit illis:
   per tribus patrum vesttorum haereditatem capietis.

   55. But if ye will not drive out the inhabitants of the land from
   before you; then it shall come to pass, that those which ye let remain
   of them shall be pricks in your eyes, and thorns in your sides, and
   shall vex you in the land wherein ye dwell.

   55. Quod si non expuleritis habitatores terrae a facie vestra, tum erit
   ut quos reliqueritis ex eis, sunt in cultros in oculis vestris, et in
   spinas lateribus vestris, et affligent vos super terram in qua vos
   habitabiris.

   56. Moreover, it shall come to pass, that I shall do unto you, as I
   thought to do unto them.

   56. Evenietque ut quemadmodum cogitavi facere illis, faciam vobis.


   1. These are the journeys of the children of Israel. Moses had not
   previously enumerated all the stations in which the people had
   encamped, but scarcely more than those in which something memorable had
   occurred, especially after the passage of the Red Sea; because it was
   of great importance that the actual localities should be set, as it
   were, before their eyes, until they were not only rescued from
   impending death by God's amazing power, but a way unto life was opened
   to them through death and the lowest deep. In fact, in one passage he
   has as good as told us that he omitted certain stations, where he
   records that the people "journeyed from the wilderness of Sin, after
   their journeys, according to the commandment of the Lord," to Rephidim,
   (Exodus 17:1) here, however, he more accurately states every place at
   which they stopped, as if he were painting a picture of their journey
   of forty years. His object in this is, first, that the remembrance of
   their deliverance, and so many accompanying blessings, might be more
   deeply impressed upon them, since local descriptions have no little
   effect in giving certainty to history; and, secondly, that they might
   be reminded by the names of the places, how often and in how many ways
   they had provoked God's anger against them; but especially that, now
   they were on the very threshold of the promised land, they might
   acknowledge that they had been kept back from it, and had been
   wandering by various tortuous routes, in consequence of their own
   depravity and stubbornness, until they had received the reward of their
   vile ingratitude. Whilst, at the same time, they might reflect that God
   had so tempered the severity of their punishment, that He still
   preserved and sustained the despisers of his grace, notwithstanding
   their iniquity and unworthiness; and also that He carried on to the
   children (of the transgressors) the covenant which He had made with
   Abraham.

   It is not without reason that Moses premises that "these were the
   journeys of the children of Israel;" for, at the period when they came
   out of the land of Goshen, they were affected with no ordinary fear and
   anxiety, when they saw themselves buried, as it were, in the grave; for
   they were shut in on every side either by the sea or the defiles of two
   mountains, or by the army of Pharaoh. Having entered the desert, they
   had seven stations before they arrived at Mount Sinai, in which they
   must have perished a hundred times over by hunger and thirst, and a
   dearth of everything, unless God had marvellously succoured them. And
   although they might have completed their whole journey in so many days,
   even then their obstinate perversity began to subject them to delay. If
   the lack of bread and water beset them, they ought to have been more
   effectually stirred up by it to have recourse humbly to God. So little
   disposed, however, were they to that humility, which might have taught
   them to ask of God by prayer and supplication a remedy for their need,
   that they rather rebelled against Moses: and not only so, but they
   petulantly assailed God Himself with their impious taunts, as if He
   were a cruel executioner instead of their Redeemer. Hence, therefore,
   it came to pass that it was not before the fortieth day that they were
   at length brought to Mount Sinai. Scarcely had the Law been
   promulgated, and whilst the awful voice of God was still ringing in
   their ears, whereby He had bound them to Himself as His people, when,
   behold, suddenly a base, nay, a monstrous falling away into idolatry,
   whence it was not their own fault that, having rejected God's grace,
   and as far as depended upon themselves having annulled the promise,
   they did not perisist miserably as they deserved. By this impediment
   they were again withheld from further progress. With the same obstinacy
   they constantly raged against God, and, though warned by many instances
   of punishment, never returned to a sound mind. The climax of their
   insane contumacy was, that when arrived at the borders of the promised
   land, they repudiated God's kindness, and exhorted each other to
   return, as if God were adverse to them, and His inestimable
   deliverance, which ought to have been a perpetual obligation to
   obedience, were utterly distasteful to them. The stations, which then
   follow, express in a more, lively manner how, -- like a ship which is
   driven away from its port by a tempest, and whirled round by various
   currents, -- they were carried away from approaching the land, and
   wandered by circuitous courses: as if they deserved that God should
   thus lead them about in mockery. It will be well for us to keep our
   eyes on this design of Moses, in order that we may read the chapter
   with profit.

   He calls the order of their marches journeys (profectiones,) in
   contradistinction to their stations: for they did not strike their camp
   unless the signal were given, i.e., when the cloud left the sanctuary,
   and moved to another spot, as if God stretched forth His hand from
   heaven to direct their way: and hence it was more clearly apparent,
   that they were retained in the desert by this power.

   3 And they departed from Rameses. I do not approve of their opinion,
   who think that the name of this city is used for the whole land of
   Goshen: since it is not reasonable that they should have set forth at
   the same time from various distant and remote places. And this would
   still less accord with what presently follows, [222] that they went
   forth in orderly array; though it might not be the case that they all
   mustered together in the city, because it is hardly credible that so
   great a multitude could be received within its walls, but that by the
   order of Moses and Aaron, they were all assembled in the neighborhood
   of the city, so that they might be organized, lest in the confusion of
   their hurried march they should impede each other.

   After having stated that they went out by "the high hand" of God, for
   the purpose of extolling still more His wonderful power, he adds that
   the Egyptians were witnesses and spectators of it: whence we conclude
   that they had at last yielded to God, [223] or were so thoroughly
   subdued, as not to dare to lift up a finger. Another circumstance is
   also added, viz., that the Egyptians were then burying all their
   first-born; by which words Moses does not mean to indicate that they
   forbore from hindering the departure of the Israelites, [224] because
   they were occupied with another matter; but rather signifies that,
   although they were exasperated by grief at the loss of their sons,
   still they lay stupified, as it were, since the power of God had
   enfeebled them, so that they had lost the ability to offer resistance.

   When Moses says, that God "executed judgments" upon the gods of the
   Egyptians, it is with the object of recommending the true faith, lest
   the children of Israel should ever turn aside to the superstitions of
   the Gentiles, which, at the time of the deliverance, they had found to
   be mere delusions. For not only were Pharaoh and his troops overthrown,
   but their gods also put to shame, when they pretended to be the
   protectors of their land: and thus were all their superstitions refuted
   and convicted of error and folly. It is a silly imagination, that all
   the idols of Egypt fell down of themselves, [225] in order that the God
   of Israel might claim the glory of Deity for Himself alone. It is
   enough that God triumphed over the idols, when He effectively shewed
   that they had no power to aid their worshippers, and, at the same time,
   discovered the trickeries of the magicians. To this Isaiah appears to
   allude, when he says,

   "Behold, the Lord shall come into Egypt, and the idols of Egypt shall
   be moved at His presence," (Isaiah 19:1)

   for he signifies that God will give such proofs of His power in Egypt,
   as shall demonstrate the vanity of all their errors, and overthrow all
   the superstitious fictions whereby the Israelites had been deceived.

   8. And they departed from before Pi-hahiroth. He relates how the people
   marched forwards for three days; not so much in praise of their
   endurance, as in celebration of God's wonderful power, who sustained so
   great a multitude without water. For we must bear in mind, what I have
   elsewhere shewn, that from the passage of the Red Sea to Marah there
   was no water found; whence the impiety of the people was the more
   detestable, since they there burst forth into rebellion on account of
   the bitter taste of the water. On the other side, the incomparable
   mercy of God shone forth, in that He condescended to refresh these
   churlish and provoking men in a pleasant and delightful station; for
   from their first encampment they were led on to Elim, where they found
   twelve fountains and seventy palm-trees. Moses passes briefly over the
   wilderness of Sin, as if nothing worthy of being recorded had occurred
   there; whereas the vile impiety of the people there betrayed itself,
   and the place was ennobled by a signal miracle, since the manna rained
   from heaven for the nourishment of the people, so that, the windows of
   heaven being opened, mortal man "did eat angels' food." He also briefly
   adverts to the want of water to drink at Rephidim: but he deemed it
   sufficient here to enumerate the stations, which might recall the
   various occurrences to the memory of the people. On the Graves of
   Concupiscence a memorial of God's punishment was inscribed; but since
   he simply gives a list of other places, without any record of events,
   we may gather, as I have above stated, that he had no other design than
   to set before the eyes of the people the peregrination in which they
   had been engaged for forty years. He, however, cursorily mentions the
   death of Aaron; because his life had been prolonged, by God's special
   blessing, for the good of the people, until the time approached when
   they were about to enter the promised land; since his authority was a
   useful and necessary restraint upon the ungovernable character of this
   headstrong people. At the same time the punishment inflicted upon the
   holy man should have reminded posterity that it was not without reason
   that their fathers had been so severely chastised, since they had not
   ceased to add sin to sin, when God had not spared even His own servant
   on account of a single transgression.

   When he adds just afterwards, that the Canaanite then first heard of
   the coming the children of Israel, he indicates that God had put a veil
   over the eyes of their enemies, lest they should oppose them at an
   earlier period. For God so mitigated the severity of His judgment, that
   the exile of the Israelites was, at any rate, undisturbed, and free
   from outward molestation, as long as they had to wander in the desert.

   50. And the Lord spake unto Moses. The end and design of God in willing
   that these nations should be expelled, I have elsewhere explained,
   [226] viz, lest they should adulterate the pure worship of God by their
   admixtures, should corrupt the people by their bad examples, and thus
   be pollutions to the Holy Land. But Moses now refers to another point,
   for, when about to speak of the division of the land, he begins by
   saying that it must be emptied of its inhabitants, that its free and
   full enjoyment may remain for the children of Israel. We must remark
   the connection here, for else this passage would have been a supplement
   of the First Commandment, to which I have indeed appended the latter
   part of the verse: but, since God declares connectedly, "Ye shall
   dispossess the inhabitants of the land, and dwell therein, for I have
   given you the land to possess it," it would have been absurd that one
   clause should be disjoined from the other.

   54 And ye shall divide the land by lot. The mode of division is also
   stated, that each should possess what fell to him by lot; and this was
   the best plan, for the several tribes would never have allowed
   themselves to be sent here or there at the option of men: and even if
   the arrangement had been left to the voices of the judges, they would
   rather have quarreled with each other than determined what was right.
   But we must here take into consideration something deeper; viz., that
   by this method God gave certain proof that the children of Israel were
   the inheritors and masters of that land by His liberality and special
   blessing. And, in the first place, we must remember that, although men
   consider nothing more fortuitous than casting lots, still they are
   governed by God, as Solomon says. (Proverbs 16:33.) God, therefore,
   commanded the people to cast lots, reserving to Himself the judgment as
   to those to whom they should fall. For how came it to pass that Zebulun
   obtained his portion on the sea-shore, except because it had been thus
   predicted by the Patriarch Jacob? Why did a district productive of the
   best corn fall to the tribe of Asher, unless because it had been
   pronounced by the same lips, that

   "Out of Asher his bread should be fat;
   and he should yield royal dainties"? (Genesis 49:20.)

   By the same prophecy the tribe of Judah obtained an inheritance rich in
   vines, and abounding in the best of pastures. Thus the division of the
   land, by lot, clearly showed that God had not formerly promised that
   land to Abraham in vain; because the proclamation of the gift by the
   mouth of Jacob was actually confirmed. The pious old man had been
   expelled from hence by famine; he was but a sojourner in Egypt, and
   twice an exile, and yet he assigns their portions to his descendants in
   the most authoritative manner, just as the father of a family might
   divide his few acres of land among his heirs. Yet God finally sealed
   what then might have seemed ridiculous. Hence it appears that things
   which, in the feebleness of our senses, we imagine to move at the blind
   impulse of chance, are directed by God's secret providence; and that
   His counsel always proceeds in such a regular course, that the end
   corresponds with the beginning. Again he recommends to them the law of
   proportion, so that, according to their numbers, a greater or a less
   allotment should be given to the several tribes. The allegory which
   some conceive to be indicated here, viz., that we obtain our heavenly
   inheritance by God's gratuitous good pleasure, as if by lot, although
   at first sight plausible, is easily refuted. Hebron was a part of the
   inheritance, but Caleb obtained it without casting lots: and a still
   more decided exception appears in the case of the tribe of Reuben, Gad,
   and half Manasseh, who, by the consent of the rest, and not by lot,
   acquired by privilege, as it were, all the territory that had been won
   on the other side of Jordan. Let my readers, therefore, learn to
   abstain from such conceits, lest they should often be obliged to
   confess with shame, that they have caught at an empty shadow.

   55 But if ye will not drive out. We have elsewhere seen why God's wrath
   was so greatly aroused against those nations, that He desired them to
   be exterminated. Even in Abraham's time gross indulgence of sin had
   begun to prevail there, as we gather from God's word, when He said that
   "their iniquity was not yet full." After they had abused the
   forbearance of God Himself for 400 years, who will deny that their
   destruction was the just and reasonable reward of their long obstinacy?
   Still, in cutting them off, God had regard to His elect people, in
   order that they might be separated from the heathen, and never turn
   aside to foreign superstitions. But the punishment which is here
   threatened the Israelites deserved twice over by their remissness, for
   they neither performed their duty in executing God's vengeance, and, as
   far as in them lay, they detracted from His grace. He had conferred
   upon them no common honor, when He appointed them to be His ministers
   for executing His judgments. It was therefore base supineness in them
   to be remiss on this point. But again, He had given them the whole
   land; when, then, they contented themselves with part of it, and
   neglected the rest, their perverse ingratitude betrayed itself by their
   indifference. Besides, they had willfully entangled themselves in
   deadly nerds, by mixing with heathen nations, from whom they had been
   separated by God, lest they should imitate their habits, and corrupt
   religious ceremonies. God, therefore, threatens that these nations
   shall be as prickles to pierce their eyes, and thorns in their sides.
   That this was fulfilled, the Book of Judges affords the clearest and
   most ample testimony, although, even to the days of David, this
   punishment was constantly in course of infliction upon their eyes and
   sides. Thus, also, is their untamable headstrongness proved, since such
   a solemn admonition had no effect in causing [227] them to go forwards,
   no less in the open punishment of iniquity, than in a course of victory
   and success.

   the land of Canaan, (this is the land that shall fall unto you for an
   inheritance, even the land of Canaan, with the coasts thereof,)

   7. And this shall be your north border: from the great sea ye shall
   point out for you mount Hor.

   7. Iste vero erit vobis terminus aquilonaris, a mari magno describetis
   vobis Hor montem.

   8. From mount Hor ye shall point out your border unto the entrance of
   Hamath; and the goings forth of the border shall be to Zedad.

   8. Ab hoc monte describetis usque ad introitum Hamach: et erunt
   eggressus termini illius ad Sedad.

   9. And the border shall go on to Ziphron, and the goings out of it
   shall be at Hazar-enan: this shall be your north border.

   9. Et illinc egredietur terminus iste ad Ziphon, eruntque egressus ejus
   ad villam Enan: iste erit vobis terminus aquilonaris.

   10. And ye shall point out your east border from Hazar-enan to Shepham.

   10. Describetis praeterea vobis terminum ad orientem, a villa Enan
   usque ad Sepham.

   11. And the coast shall go down from Shepham to Riblah, on the east of
   Ain; and the border shall descend, and shall reach unto the side of the
   sea of Chinnereth eastward.

   11. Et destendet iste terminus a Sepham usque ad Riblah ab oriente Ain:
   et descendet terminus iste, provenietque ad latus maris Cinnereth ad
   orientem.

   12. And the border shall go down to Jordan, and the goings out of it
   shall be at the salt sea: this shall be your land, with the coasts
   thereof round about.

   12. Et descendet iste terminus ad Jordanem, erunt que egressus ejus ad
   mare salis: ista erit vobis terra per terminos suos, per circuitum.

   13. And Moses commanded the children of Israel, saying, This is the
   land which ye shall inherit by lot, which the Lord commanded to give
   unto the nine tribes, and to the half-tribe.

   13. Praecepit autem Moses filiis Israel, dicendo: Haec est terra quam
   possidebitis sorte, et quam princepit Jehova dare novem tribubus, et
   dimidiae tribui.

   14. For the tribe of the children of Reuben, according to the house of
   their fathers, and the tribe of the children of Gad, according to the
   house of their fathers, have received their inheritance, and half the
   tribe of Manasseh have received their inheritance:

   14. Acceperunt enim tribus filiorum Rubenitarum per domos patrum
   suorum, et tribus filiorum Gaditarum per domos patrum suorum, et
   dimidia tribus Manasse: acceperunt inquam haereditatem suam:

   15. The two tribes and the half-tribe have received their inheritance
   on this side Jordan near Jericho eastward, toward the sun-rising.

   15. Duae tribus et dimidia acceperunt possessionem suam citra Jordanera
   Jericho ad orientem ad exortum solis.

   16. And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying,

   16. Loquutus est praeterea Jehova ad Mosen, dicendo:

   17. These are the names of the men which shall divide the land unto
   you; Eleazar the priest, and Joshua the son of Nun.

   17. Ista sunt nomina virorum qui possidendam vobis distribuent terram,
   Eleazar sacerdos, et Josue filius Nun.

   18. And ye shall take one prince of every tribe, to divide the land by
   inheritance.

   18. Et principes singulos de qualibet tribu capietis ad possidendam
   terram.

   19. And the names of the men are these: Of the tribe of Judah, Caleb,
   the son of Jephunneh.

   19. Ista sunt nomina virorun: de tribu Jehudah, Caleb filius Jephune.

   20. And of the tribe of the children of Simeon, Shemuel the son of
   Ammihud.

   20. Et de tribu filiorum Simeon, Samuel filius Ammihud.

   21. Of the tribe of Benjamin, Elidad the son of Chislon.

   21. Et de tribu Benjamin, Elidad filius Chislon.

   22. And the prince of the tribe of the children of Dan, Bukki the son
   of Jogli.

   22. Et de tribu filiorum Dan, princeps Bucci filius Jogli.

   23. The prince of the children of Joseph, for the tribe of the children
   of Manasseh, Harmtel the son of Ephod.

   23. De filiis Joseph, de tribu filiorum Manasse, princeps Huiel filius
   Ephod.

   24. And the prince of the tribe of the children of Ephraim, Kemuel the
   son of Shiphtan.

   24. Et de tribu filiorum Ephraim, princeps Cemuel illius Siphtan.

   25. And the prince of the tribe of the children of Zebulun, Elizaphan
   the son of Parnach.

   25. Et de tribu filiorum Zabulon, princeps Elisaphan filius Parvaeh.

   26. And the prince of the tribe of the children of lssachar, Paltiel
   the son of Azzan.

   26. Et de tribu filiorum Issachar, princeps Paltiel illius Azzam.

   27. And the prince of the tribe of the children of Asher, Ahihud the
   son of Shelomi.

   27. Et de tribu filiorum Aser, princeps Ahihud filius Selomi.

   28. And the prince of the tribe of the children of Naphtali, Pedahel
   the son of Ammihud.

   28. Et de tribu filiorum Nephthali, princeps Pedahel filius Ammihud.

   29. These are they whom the Lord commanded to divide the inheritance
   unto the children of Israel in the land of Canaan.

   29. Isti sunt quibus praecepit Jehova, Ut distribuerent haereditatem
   filiis Israel in terra Chenaan.


   1. And the Lord spake unto Moses. God here undertakes the office of a
   prudent and careful father of a family, in fixing the boundaries of the
   land on every side, lest their right to posses it should ever be called
   in question. He begins on the southern side, where it must be observed
   that the district of Bashan is included in it, and all that the
   Israelites had acquired before their passage of the Jordan, so that
   this addition was approved of by God. He extends this part as far as
   the wilderness of Sin, and the borders of Edom, and brings it round
   from Kadesh-barnea to Addar, and the passage of Azmon, and, finally, to
   the stream which washes [228] the city of Rhinocorura, in the immediate
   vicinity of Egypt; for by "the river of Egypt" the Nile is by no means
   to be understood, the course of which was not at all in that direction.
   The southern boundary, therefore, was from the Mediterranean Sea
   towards Arabia. On the western side the land was washed by the
   Mediterranean Sea, which is here called "the Great Sea," in comparison
   with the Lake of Gennesareth, and the Salt Sea, by which name the Lacus
   Asphaltires is here meant. The beginning of the northern boundary was
   the promontory of Hor, for it would not accord to suppose that the
   mountain is here referred to in which Aaron died, and which was far
   away, and situated on the opposite side of the land. It extended from
   hence to Epiphania in Syria, which is called Hamath; for I agree with
   Jerome in thinking that there were two cities of this name, and it is
   undoubtedly probable that Antioch is called "Hamath the great" by the
   Prophet Amos (Amos 6:2,) in comparison with the lesser city here
   mentioned, the name of which was given it by that wicked and cruel
   tyrant (Antiochus) Epiphanes; whether, however, the greater Antioch was
   formerly called Hamath and Riblab, as Jerome states, I leave undecided.
   It then passed on to Zedad and Ziphron, and its extremity was the
   village of Enan. The eastern boundary passed from thence through
   Shephan, Riblah, and Ain, until it reached the Lake of Gennesareth, a
   lake sufficiently well known, and here called the Sea of Chinnereth.
   Thus the eastern boundary pointed from Arabia in the direction of
   Persia, and Babylon was situated to the north-east of it.

   13. And Moses commanded the children of Israel. Though this is a
   repetition, yet it is not a superfluous one; for he contrasts the new
   allotment of the nine tribes and a half with the former grant; [229]
   for the exception, which is immediately added, as to the lands beyond
   Jordan, given to the Reubenites, and Gadites, and half tribe of
   Manasseh, does not exclude them from their part of the promised
   inheritance was if they were disinherited, and therefore banished
   beyond the boundaries prescribed by God -- but only from being subject
   to the casting of lots, because they had by special privilege obtained
   from their brethren what would else have been included in the common
   inheritance. Not that this had been revealed from the beginning, but
   because God in His indulgence had complied with their request, whereby
   they enlarged the boundaries of the land. And assuredly it would have
   been absurd that no place should be given them among their brethren in
   the promised land, as if they were cast off from the family of Abraham.
   We have lately seen that this part, which seemed to be separated from
   the others, was included in the limits laid down by God. Moses,
   therefore, merely wished to declare that what remained was to be
   divided by lot.

   16 And the Lord spake unto Moses. The question here arises, if the
   Israelites were to divide the land among themselves by lot, wherefore
   was the authority of the judges required, as if there was anything for
   them to decide? But if we consider what has been lately shown, that
   reference was to be had, in the distribution of the land, to the
   numbers in every tribe, it was requisite for two purposes, -- first,
   that God might show by His decree the districts respectively assigned
   to them; and, secondly, that their dimensions might be proportionate to
   the number of their occupants. For the casting of lots was still
   necessary, because many would have been averse to the sea-coast, or
   would have preferred the center of the land to its extremities, or
   would have been unwilling to be banished to the mountains; in short,
   they would have contended with each other beyond measure in murmurings
   and strife. On this account the lots were cast, by the decision of
   which God placed the several tribes in whatever position He pleased,
   although the judges, together with the High Priest and Joshua, had
   before divided the land into ten portions. But after it was declared in
   what district the several tribes were to dwell, as if God had there
   designated their abodes, the determination of men was again necessarily
   had recourse to, as to how far, and in what direction, the boundaries
   of the greater tribes were to extend; otherwise the lesser tribes would
   have refused to be cooped up in a less convenient position. And
   although the supreme authority was justly vested in Eleazar and Joshua,
   lest God should expose them to calumny and ill-will, He associated with
   them a council, in which also there was a prudent precaution against
   rivalry, for each of the twelve tribes contributed its judge to preside
   over the distribution, so that none might complain of being aggrieved.
   Moreover, inasmuch as it was of great importance that the possession,
   once established, should be secured to posterity, first of all the
   names of the princes are recorded, in order to give certainty to the
   history; and, secondly, as had been stated at the beginning of the
   chapter, so also it is repeated at the end that they were chosen by
   God, from whence the Israelites learnt that the boundaries then fixed
   could not be altered without overthrowing the authority of God Himself.
     __________________________________________________________________

   [228] There has been much discussion amongst the commentators on this
   point. The conclusion to which Dr. Kitto comes, after due examination
   of the opposite theory, is, that "the river of Egypt," when mentioned
   as a boundary, cannot mean the Nile. "The present river of Egypt' (he
   adds) probably denotes a stream which formed the extreme boundary of
   the country eastward of the Nile, which Egypt, even in these early
   times, professed to claim, and which derived its name from that
   circumstance. It was probably not far from El-Arish, to which, under
   the name of Rhinocorura, it is expressly referred by the Septuagint.
   That it was a stream somewhere between the southern frontier of
   Palestine and the Nile we are deeply convinced." -- Illustr. Com., in

   Deuteronomy 31

   Deuteronomy 31:1-8

   1. And Moses went and spake these words unto all Israel.

   1. Abiit itaque Moses, et loquutus est verba ista ad universum
   Israelem.

   2. And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old this
   day; I can no more go out and come in: also the Lord hath said unto me,
   Thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

   2. Dixitque eis, Centurn et viginti annerum suae hodie, non possum
   ultra egredi et ingredi: praeterea Jehova dixit ad me, Non transibis
   Jordanera istum.

   3. The Lord thy God, he will go over before thee, and he will destroy
   these nations from before thee, and thou shalt possess them: and
   Joshua, he shall go over before thee, as the Lord hath said.

   3. Jehova Deus tuus ipse transiturus est ante te, ipse disperdet gentes
   istas a facie tua, possidebisque eas: Josua ipse transiturus est ante
   te, quemadmodum dixit Jehova.

   4. And the Lord shall do unto them as he did to Sihon and to Og, kings
   of the Amorites, and unto the land of them, whom he destroyed.

   4. Facietque Jehova illis quemadmodum fecit Sihon et Og, regibus
   Emorrhaei, et terrae eorum quos disperdidit.

   5. And the Lord shall give them up before your face, that ye may do
   unto them according unto all the commandments which I have commanded
   you.

   5. Quum ergo dederit eos Jehova ante faciem vestram, tunc facietis eis
   omnino juxta praeceptum quod praecepi vobis.

   6. Be strong and of a good courage, fear not, nor be afraid of them:
   for the Lord thy God, he it is that doth go with thee; he will not fail
   thee, nor forsake thee.

   6. Estote fortes, et roborate vos, ne timeatis, neque paveatis a facie
   eorum: Jehova enim Deus tuus est qui pergit tecum, non deseret te,
   neque te derelinquet.

   7. And Moses called unto Joshua, and said unto him in the sight of all
   Israel, Be strong, and of a good courage: for thou must go with this
   people unto the land which the Lord hath sworn unto their fathers to
   give them; and thou shalt cause them to inherit it.

   7. Vocavit ergo Moses Josua, et dixit illi in oculis totius Israelis,
   Esto fortis, et robera te: tu enim ingredieris cum populo isto terram
   quam juravit Jehova patribus eorum se daturum illis, et ipse sorte
   divides eam illis.

   8. And the Lord, he it is that doth go before thee; he will be with
   thee, he will not fail thee, neither forsake thee: fear not, neither be
   dismayed.

   8. Jehova autem est qui praecessurus est te, ipse erit tecum: non te
   deseret, neque derelinquet te, ne timeas, neque paveas.


   1 And Moses went and spake these words. By the word went he signifies
   that, having received the commands from God, he came to the people to
   report them. Hence we gather that they were warned in good time to
   beware, if they had been sensibly disposed. And it was necessary that
   the people should hear from his own mouth these addresses, which were
   by no means gratifying, as being full both of cruel threats and severe
   reproofs; for, if they had been delivered after his death, they would
   have straightway all exclaimed that they had been deceitfully devised
   by some one else, and thus that his name was falsely attached to them.

   Moreover, the peculiar time of their delivery did not a little avail to
   enhance their weight, so that the people should not only submit
   themselves with meekness and teachableness to his instruction at the
   moment, but also that it might remain hereafter deeply impressed upon
   their hearts. We know with what attention the last words of the dying
   are usually received; and Moses, [230] now ready to meet death at God's
   command, addressed the people as if bidding them finally farewell. To
   the credit and dignity belonging to his office as a Prophet, there was
   consequently added all the force and authority of a testamentary
   disposition.

   As throughout his life he had been incredibly anxious for the people's
   welfare, so he now carries his more than paternal care still further.
   And assuredly it becomes all pious teachers to provide, as far as in
   them lies, that the fruit of their labors should survive them. Of this
   solicitude Peter sets himself before us as an example:

   "I think it meet (he says), as long as I am in this tabernacle, to stir
   you up by putting you in remembrance; moreover, I will endeavor that ye
   may be able after my decease to have these things always in
   remembrance." (2 Peter 1:13, 15)

   2 And he said unto them, I am an hundred and twenty years old. Although
   Moses had been often proudly and disdainfully rejected, it could not
   but be the case, nevertheless, that his departure would both awaken the
   deepest sorrow, and inspire them with much alarm. By setting before
   them his age, therefore, he consoles their anxiety, and mitigates their
   grief; and also, by another reason, he represses their lamentations,
   i.e., that God had fixed his term of life. He adduces it, then, as an
   alleviation, because both his death was more than mature, and he was no
   longer fitted in his extreme old age for enduring fatigue. Here,
   however, the question arises, why he should say that he was failing,
   and broken in strength, when we shall see a little further on that he
   retained his senses in their rigor even until his death? But the reply
   is obvious, that he would not have been useless in his old age, because
   his eyes were dim or his members tremulous, but because his age no
   longer allowed him to perform his usual duties. For he had been
   marvelously and preternaturally preserved up to that time; but, since
   he had now arrived at the end of his course, it was necessary that he
   should suddenly sink, and be deprived of his faculties.

   "To go out, and come in," is equivalent to performing the functions of
   life: thus it is said in the Psalm, "Thou has known my going out and
   coming in." [231] (Psalm 121:8.) And in this sense David is said to
   have gone out and come in, when he performed the duty intrusted to him
   by Saul. (1 Samuel 18:5.)

   In the latter clause, where he refers to his exclusion from the land of
   Canaan, and his being prevented from entering it, he indirectly rebukes
   the people, for whose offense God had been wroth with himself and
   Aaron. Thus by this tacit reproof the Israelites were admonished to
   bear patiently the penalty of their ingratitude. At the same time., as
   he shows himself to be submissive to the divine decree, he bids them
   also acquiesce in it.

   3 The Lord thy God, he will go over. By no ordinary consolation does he
   encourage their minds to renewed alacrity, because they should
   experience, even when he was dead, the unceasing favor of God. Hence we
   gather a lesson of especial usefulness, that whenever God raises up to
   us men endowed with excellent gifts, He is wont so to make use of their
   labors for a time, as still to retain others in His hand, and
   constantly to substitute others, unless our sins stand in the way.
   Hence it follows that the power of God is not to be tied to the
   illustrious qualities of men, as if their death was His destruction. It
   is true, indeed, that eminent men are rarely succeeded by their equals,
   [232] because our wickedness stifles the light of spiritual gifts, and,
   as far as it can, extinguishes them; still let this be deemed certain
   that, when God promotes our welfare by ministers of special eminence,
   He gives us a taste of His goodness, in order that we may expect its
   continuance; "because he forsakes not the work of his own hands."
   (Psalm 138:8.) Moses says, therefore, that although he may be taken
   away by death, still God will undertake the office of their leader, or
   rather that He will continue to be their leader, as the Israelites had
   before experienced Him to be.

   But h sustains their infirmity by another consolation also, pointing
   out Joshua as his successor; otherwise the people might have been ready
   to object that, if God was willing to go before them, why did he not
   manifest it by the election of a representative, by whose hand He might
   continue what He had begun by Moses. In this respect, therefore, he
   also shows that God's favor was by no means obscure, since Joshua was
   already chosen to sustain the care and burden of governing the people:
   for it is not by his own authority that he obtrudes Joshua and sets him
   over them, but he declares him to be called by God. Still, it is not a
   matter hitherto unknown which he puts before them, but only bids them
   remember what God had long ago revealed, as we have elsewhere seen.

   4 And the Lord shall do unto them. He promises that, when they shall
   come into the land of Canaan, they shall be conquerors of all its
   nations: and this he confirms by experience; for, as God had delivered
   Sihon king of the Arnorites, and Og king of Bashan, into their hands,
   so also He would give them the same success in subduing their other
   enemies. The world is indeed subject to many revolutions, but God still
   remains like Himself, not only because His counsel is never changed,
   but because His power is never diminished. By a real proof, therefore,
   as it is called, he encourages the expectations of the people, and at
   the same time exhorts them resolutely to execute God's command, viz.,
   that they should purge the land of Canaan by the destruction of all its
   inhabitants. In appearance, indeed, this was fierce and cruel, to leave
   not even one alive; but, since God had justly devoted them to
   extinction, it was not lawful for the Israelites to inquire what was to
   be done, but to abandon all discussion, and to obey God's command. In
   that they spared many, so much the worse was their remissness, since
   God had often prepared them to execute the vengeance which He had
   decreed.

   6 Be strong and of good courage. After he had shown that God would be
   with them, for their help, he exhorts the people to firmness and
   magnanimity. And surely this is one means of confirming our courage, to
   be assured that the assistance which God promises will suffice for us:
   so far is it from being the case, that our zeal and energy in acting
   aright is impaired, by our ascribing to the grace of God what foolish
   men attribute to their own free will. For those who are aroused to
   strenuous action in reliance on their own strength, do no more than
   cast themselves headlong in their senseless temerity and pride. Let us
   understand, then, that all exhortations are fleeting and ineffective,
   which are founded on anything else but simple confidence in the grace
   of God. Thus Moses assumes, as his ground of exhortation, that God will
   fight for the Israelites. It must, however, be observed that the people
   were animated to the perseverance of hope, when God declares that He
   will be their helper even to the end, by which lesson that impious
   hallucination is refuted, whereby the Popish theologians have
   fascinated the world. They deny that believers [233] can be certain of
   God's grace, except as to their present state. Thus do they hold faith
   in suspense, so that we may only believe for a day, and even from
   moment to moment, whilst we are in uncertainty as to what God will do
   with us on the morrow. Whereas, if faith corresponds with God's
   promises, and is, as it were, in harmony with them, it must needs
   extend itself to our whole life, nay, even beyond death itself; for God
   removes all doubt as to the future by these words, "I will not leave
   thee nor forsake thee."

   7 And Moses called unto Joshua. It hence appears that those, upon whom
   a public charge is conferred, have need of a twofold confirmation: for,
   after having addressed a general instruction to the whole people, he
   directs his discourse peculiarly to Joshua himself, as to one whose
   business it was to set an example of bravery to others, and whom severe
   contests awaited. Since, then, it is more difficult to lead all the
   rest than to follow a leader, it is necessary that he, who is set over
   many, should far excel them. But, inasmuch as no one call do anything
   of himself, we must seek of God whatever we want. Wherefore that, which
   Moses had enjoined upon the whole people, he now repeats to a single
   individual, because upon him the burden of ruling them was thrown. And
   this must be more carefully observed, because, in proportion to the
   degree of honor, in which a man is placed, so does he disdainfully look
   down upon all admonitions; whence it is the case that those, who are
   eminent in the world, carelessly reject the exhortations of God's
   servants. But Moses thoroughly overthrows all such fastidiousness, when
   he shows that all, who are in authority, should not only be instructed
   together with others, but even more urgently dealt with.

   When Moses, in this place as well as above, forbids believers to give
   way to fear or dread, it must be observed that. he would not have them
   so deprived of all feeling, as to be hardened into indifference to
   every danger, or to suppose, as some madmen do, that there is no such
   thing as bravery without stupidity, but only possessed of such
   confidence as may overcome all fears, which impede the course of their
   calling. Appropriately does the Apostle extend this lesson further,
   where he wishes to correct avarice, which arises from over-anxiety,
   whilst wretched men do not sufficiently reflect what it is to have God
   for their perpetual helper. (Hebrews13:5.)

   Numbers 27

   Numbers 27:15-23

   15. And Moses spake unto the Lord, saying,

   15. Loquutus est igitur Moses ad Jehovam, dicendo:

   16. Let the Lord, the God of the of all flesh, set a man over the
   spirits of the flesh, set a man over the congregation,

   16. Praeficiat Jehova Deus spirituum omnis carnis, virum super
   congregationem:

   17. Which may go out before them, and which may go in before them, and
   which may lead them out, and which may bring them in; that the
   congregation of the Lord be not as sheep which have no shepherd.

   17. Qui egrediatur ante eos, et qui ingrediatur ante eos, id est, qui
   educat eos, et introducat eos, ne sit congregatio Jehovae velut pecudes
   quae nullum habent pastorera.

   18. And the Lord said unto Moses, Take thee Joshua the son of Nun, a
   man in whom is the spirit, and lay thine hand upon him:

   18. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Cape tibi Josue filium Nun, virum in quo
   est spiritus, et imponas manum tuam super eam.

   19. And set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the
   congregation; and give him a charge in their sight.

   19. Statuasque illum coram Eleazar sacerdote, et coram universa
   congregatione: et dabis illi mandata in oculis corum.

   20. And thou shalt put some of thine honor upon him, that all the
   congregation of the children of Israel may be obedient.

   20. Et pones de gloria tua super illum, ut audiant illurn universa
   congregatio filiorum Israel.

   21. And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel
   for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord: at his word shall
   they go out, and at his word they shall come in, both he, and all the
   children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.

   21. Qui postea coram Eleazar stabit, et interrogabit eum de judicio
   Urim coram Jehova: ad verbum ejus egredientur ipse et omnes filii
   Israel cum eo, et tota congregatio.

   22. And Moses did as the Lord commanded him: and he took Joshua, and
   set him before Eleazar the priest, and before all the congregation.

   22. Fecit ergo Moses quemadmodum praeceperat ei Jehova: accepit namque
   Josua, et statuit illum coram Eleazar sacerdote, et coram universa
   congregatione.

   23. And he laid his hands upon him, and gave him a charge; as the Lord
   commanded by the hand of Moses.

   23. Imposuitque manus super illum, ac dedit illi mandata quemadmodum
   dixerat Jehova per manum Mosis.


   15. And Moses spake. Moses here sets forth not only God's providence in
   attending to the welfare of the people, but also his own zeal for them.
   Hence it appears how paternal was his affection for them, in that he
   not only performed his duty towards them faithfully and earnestly, and
   shunned no pains that it cost him, even to the end of his life, but he
   also makes provision for the future, and is anxious about a suitable
   successor, lest the people should remain without one, like a headless
   body. We perceive also his humility, when he does not arrogate the
   right of appointment to himself, nor on his own authority submit the
   matter to the election of the people, but establishes God as its sole
   arbiter. It was, indeed, permitted him to choose the officers, and this
   was a part of the political constitution; but this was too difficult a
   task, to find by man's judgment one who should suffice for its
   performance; and, consequently, it behoved that the power should be
   intrusted to God alone, who did not indeed refuse to undertake it. And
   this special reason had much force in so difficult a point, viz., that
   the people should receive their leader at His hand, in order that the
   supreme power should always remain vested in Himself. As, therefore, He
   had chosen Moses in an extraordinary manner, and had appointed him to
   be His representative, so He continued the same grace in the case of
   Joshua. Already, indeed, had He designated him; but, out of modesty,
   Moses omits his name, and simply prays that God would provide for His
   people.

   The title, with which he honors God, has reference to the matter in
   question. It is true, indeed, that God may be often called "the God of
   the spirits of all flesh," and for another reason, in chap. 16:22,
   Moses makes use of this expression; but he now alludes to this
   attribute, as much as to say, that there must be some one ready, and as
   it were in His hand, who should be appointed, since He has the making
   of all men according to His own will. Men often are mistaken and
   deceived in their opinions, and, even although the Spirit of God may
   enlighten them, they go no further than to discern the peculiar
   endowment for which a person is eminent; but God is not only the best
   judge of each man's ability and aptitude, nor does He only penetrate to
   the inmost recesses of every heart; but He also fashions and refashions
   the men whom He chooses as His ministers, and supplies them with the
   faculties they require in order to be sufficient for bearing the
   burden. We gather from hence a useful lesson, i.e., that, when we are
   deprived of good rulers, they should be sought from the Maker Himself,
   whose special gift the power of good government is. And on this ground
   Moses calls Him not only the Creator of men, but "of all flesh," and
   expressly refers to their "spirits."

   When he compares the people to sheep, it is for the purpose of
   awakening compassion, so that God may be more disposed to appoint them
   a shepherd.

   18. And the Lord said unto Moses. We here see that Joshua was given in
   answer to the prayers of Moses, which is not stated elsewhere. But, in
   order that he may obtain his dignity with the consent of all, he is
   honored with a signal encomium: for, when God declares that the Spirit
   is in him, He does not merely intimate that he has a soul, but that he
   excels in the necessary gifts, such as intelligence. judgment,
   magnanimity, and skill in war: and the word "spirit" is used, in a
   different sense from that which it has just above, for that eminent and
   rare grace, which manifested itself in Joshua. For this metonymy [234]
   is a tolerably common figure in Scripture.

   The solemn rite of his consecration by the imposition of hands follows,
   respecting which I have treated so fully elsewhere, [235] that it is
   now superfluous to say much upon it. It was in use before the giving of
   the Law, for thus the holy patriarchs blessed their sons. We have seen
   that the priests were inaugurated in their office, and that victims
   were offered to God, with this ceremony. The apostles followed this
   custom in the appointment of pastors. Moses, therefore, in order to
   testify publicly that Joshua was no longer his own master, but
   dedicated to God, and no longer to be regarded as a private individual,
   since he was called by God to the supreme command, laid his hands upon
   his head.

   There was also another reason, viz., that, according to the
   requirements of the office intrusted to him, God would more and more
   enrich him (with His gifts;(Added from Fr.)) for there is nothing to
   prevent God from conferring richer endowments upon His servants
   according to the nature of their vocation, although they may have
   previously been eminent for spiritual gifts. Thus to Timothy, when he
   was appointed a pastor, new grace was given by the imposition of the
   hands of Paul, although he had before attained to no ordinary eminence.
   (2 Timothy 1:6.) To the same effect is what follows, that Moses should
   put some of his glory [236] upon him, as if resigning his own dignity;
   for by the word glory, not only external splendor, but rather spiritual
   honor is signified, whereby God commands reverence towards His
   servants; not that he was stripped of his own virtues by transferring
   them to Joshua, but because, without diminution of his own gifts, he
   made the person who was about to be his successor his associate in
   their possession.

   It was fitting that this should be done before all the people, that all
   might willingly receive him as presented to them by God.

   The charge given to him partly tended to confirm the authority of
   Joshua, and partly to bind him more solemnly to discharge his duties;
   for, inasmuch as Moses commanded him what he was to do in the name of
   God, he exempted himself from all suspicion of temerity; and, on the
   other hand, by the introduction of this duly authorized engagement,
   Joshua must have been more and more encouraged to faith and diligence.

   21. And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest. Joshua is here
   subordinated to the priest on one point, viz., to inquire of him by the
   Urim and Thummim: for, as we have seen before, [237] the dignity of the
   priesthood was exalted by this symbol, that the prince should consult
   God by the mouth of the priest, who, being clothed in the sacred Ephod,
   the emblems of which were the Urim and Thummim, gave replies as the
   interpreter of God Himself. This passage, then, shows that the rule of
   Joshua was not profane; as in all legitimate dominion religion ought
   surely to hold the first place; for, since all things depend upon God,
   it is absurd that they should be separated from His service.

   mspht, mishphat, that is, judgment, is here used for a rule, or
   prescribed course of action, as if he were commanded to seek the Law
   [238] from the oracles of God, which the priest was to receive and
   deliver from him, and that in perplexing matters he was to follow
   nothing else.

   Moses adds, in conclusion, that he did what. God had enjoined, so that
   all might be fully assured that God would rule, no less than before, in
   the person of Joshua.

   A Repetition of the same History

   Deuteronomy 3

   Deuteronomy 3:21-29

   21. And I commanded Joshua at that time, saying, Thine eyes have seen
   all that the Lord your God hath done unto these two kings: so shall the
   Lord do unto all the kingdoms whither thou passest.

   21. Ipsi quoque Josua praecepi eo tempore, dicendo, Oculi tui viderunt
   quaecunque fecit Jehova Deus vester duobus regibus: sic facturus est
   Jehova omnibus regnis ad quae tu pergis.

   22. Ye shall not fear them: for the Lord your God he shall fight for
   you.

   22. Ne timeatis eos, quia Jehova Deus vester ipse est qui pugnat pro
   vobis.

   23. And I besought the Lord at that time, saying,

   23. Rogaveram autem Jehovam tempore illo, dicendo:

   24. O Lord God, thou hast begun to show thy servant thy greatness, and
   thy mighty hand: for what God is there in heaven or in earth that can
   do according to thy works, and according to thy might?

   24. Domine Jehova, tu coepisti ostendere servo tuo magnitudinem tuam,
   et manum tuam validam. Quis enim Deus in coelo, aut in terra, qui
   faciat secundum opera tua, et secundum fortitudines tuas?

   25. I pray thee, let me go over and see the good land that is beyond
   Jordan, that goodly mountain, and Lebanon.

   25. Transeam quaeso, et videam terram illam bonam, quae est trans
   Jordanem, montem istum bonum et Libanum.

   26. But the Lord was wroth with me for your sakes, and would not hear
   me: and the Lord said unto me, Let it suffice thee; speak no more unto
   me of this matter.

   26. Iratus autem Jehova contra me propter vos, propterea non exaudivit
   me, sed dixit mihi, Sufficiat tibi, ne posthac addas verbum ad me super
   hac re.

   27. Get thee up into the top of Pisgah, and lift up thine eyes
   westward, and northward, and southward, and eastward, and behold it
   with thine eyes: for thou shalt not go over this Jordan.

   27. Ascende verticem Pisgah, et leva oculos tuos ad occidentem, ad
   aquilonem, ad meridiem, et ad orientem, ac vide oculis tuis, non enim
   transibis Jordanem istum.

   28. But charge Joshua, and encourage him, and strengthen him: for he
   shall go over before this people, and he shall cause them to inherit
   the land which thou shalt see.

   28. Praecipe autem Josuae, et confirma eum, et robora eum, ipse enim
   transiturus est ante populum istum, et idem tradet illis terram
   possidendam, quam videbis.

   29. So we abode in the valley over against Beth-peor.

   29. Mansimus vero in valle e regione Beth-peor.


   21. And I commanded Joshua at that time. He repeats what we have
   already seen, that he exhorted Joshua together with the whole people to
   prepare themselves to occupy the land with alacrity, relying as well
   upon God's promise, as upon the numerous proofs of His assistance,
   which were so many pledges of the future continuance of His grace.

   23 And I besought the Lord. [239] Others have, "I besought;" but I have
   preferred using the pluperfect tense, because, in my opinion, Moses
   interrupts himself to show why he had resigned his office to another,
   and did not rather declare that he would be their leader, as
   heretofore, and at the same time an example to the people of courage.
   He says, therefore, that when he had prayed that he might be permitted
   to enter the land, he received a refusal. For it is not probable that,
   after he had substituted Joshua for himself, he straightway conceived a
   desire, which was in direct opposition to it.

   The drift of the prayer is that God, by granting him permission to
   enter the land, should thus fill up to the full the measure of His
   grace towards him: for he enumerates the blessings already vouchsafed
   to him, as the ground of his confidence in asking, and that God, who is
   not wont to forsake the work of His own hands, might carry on to the
   end the mercies He had begun. For this reason he says that the might of
   God had been shown him; modestly hinting that it was natural to expect
   that he should be a partaker of the crowning blessing, in order that
   the end might correspond with the beginning. He also magnifies the
   power of God as proclaimed by the miracles; that so magnificent a work
   might not be interrupted. On the other hand, he speaks in commendation
   of the goodness of the land, and expressly shows that his desire to see
   it springs from earnest piety; for I willingly subscribe to the opinion
   of those who understand Sion by the "goodly mountain;" for, with the
   exception of Lebanon, there was no other mountain so delectable in the
   land; whereas Lebanon, as if next to it in rank, is mentioned in the
   second place.

   26. But the Lord was wroth with me. Some imagine that God was offended
   by such a longing as this; but Moses is rather giving the reason why he
   did not obtain what he sought, viz., because he had been already
   excluded from it. For, although he by no means enters into debate with
   God, as if he had been unjustly condemned for the faults of others,
   still he indirectly reflects upon the people, since it was well that
   they should be all reminded that the punishment which had been
   inflicted upon God's distinguished servant was incurred by the guilt of
   them all. We have elsewhere seen [240] how it was that the penalty of
   their common transgression was with justice imposed upon Moses.

   Its mitigation then follows, when God commands him to get up into the
   top of Mount Abarim, which is here called Pisgah, and elsewhere Nebo,
   that he might nevertheless enjoy a sight of the promised land.

   In conclusion, he more clearly explains why he exhorted Joshua, viz.,
   because he was about to go over before the people; and in the last
   verse he assigns the reason of their delay, and why they remained so
   long in the valley near Mount Abarim; for it is precisely as if he had
   said that they were retained by the extension of God's hand, in order
   that they should not proceed any further until Joshua had been
   installed as his successor.

   Deuteronomy 4

   Deuteronomy 4:21, 22

   21. Furthermore, the Lord was angry with me for your sakes, and sware
   that I should not go over Jordan, and that I should go in unto that
   good land which the Lord thy God giveth thee for an inheritance;

   21. Jehova iratus fuit contra me propter verba vestra, juravitque quod
   non transirem Jordanem, neque ingrederer terram bonam, quam Jehova Deus
   tuus dat tibi in haereditatcm.

   22. But I must die in this land, I must not go over Jordan: but ye
   shall go over, and possess that good land.

   22. Ego enim morior in hac terra, neque transeo Jordanem: vos antem
   transitis, ut possideatis terram istam bonam.


   21. Furthermore, the Lord was angry with me. He again records that it
   arose from the transgression of the people that he was not permitted to
   enter the land, not by way of expostulation, and much less in order to
   accuse God of cruelty, as if he had been improperly and unjustly
   substituted as a criminal in the place of others, but rather to magnify
   the goodness of God towards those whom He had treated with so much
   indulgence. For we must observe the comparison, that, whilst they were
   to enjoy the land, he was to be prevented from entering it. "I must die
   (he says) in this land" of Moab, whilst to you it is given to enjoy the
   promised inheritance. We perceive, therefore, that they are upbraided
   with their guilt in such a way that all the bitterness of the reproof
   is sweetened by the sense of God's mercy; nay, that by this sweetness
   they may be ravished into admiration, when they understand how
   mercifully that pardon is extended to them, which was denied to Moses.

   The sense of the expression which I have rendered "for your words,"
   [241] might be "for your things," inasmuch as the Hebrews call men's
   affairs (negotia), dvrym, debarim. Assuredly, although he had been
   impelled to sin by their rebellious clamors, he simply states that he
   was now punished on their account. If any should inquire why he lays
   the blame on them, whereas the actual offenders were most of them dead,
   the reply is obvious, that many of them were still surviving, and that
   it is no novelty that the children should be included with the fathers,
   when the whole body of a people has sinned.

   Deuteronomy 31

   Deuteronomy 31:14-30

   14. And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thy days approach that thou
   must die: call Joshua, and present yourselves in the tabernacle of the
   congregation, that I may give him a charge. And Moses and Joshua went,
   and presented themselves in the tabernacle of the congregation.

   14. Et dixit Jehova ad Mosen, Ecce, appropinquaverunt dies tui, ut
   moriaris: voca Josua, et state in tabernaculo conventionis, et
   praecipiam ei. Perrexit ergo Moses et Josua, steteruntque in
   tabernaculo conventionis.

   15. And the Lord appeared in the tabernacle in a pillar of a cloud: and
   the pillar of the cloud stood over the door of the tabernacle.

   15. Et apparuit Jehova in tabernaculo, in columna nubis, stetitque
   columna nubis super ostium tabernaculi.

   16. And the Lord said unto Moses, Behold, thou shalt sleep with thy
   fathers; and this people will rise up, and go a whoring after the gods
   of the strangers of the land whither they go to be among them, and will
   forsake me, and break my covenant which I have made with them.

   16. Et dixit Jehova, ad Mosen, Ecce, tu dormiturus es cum patribus
   tuis: postea surget populus iste, et fornicabitur post deos alienorum
   terrae ad quam pergit in medio ejus, et derelinquet me, irritumque
   faciet pactum meum quod pepigi cum eo.

   17. Then my anger shall be kindled against them in that day, and I will
   them, and I will hide my face from them, and they shall be devoured,
   and many evils and troubles shall befall them; so that they will say in
   that day, Are not these evils come upon us, because our God is not
   among us?

   17. Itaque irascetur vultus meus contra eum ipse die, ac derelinquam
   eos, et abscondam faciem meam ab eis: et consumetur, et inverient eum
   mala multa, et angustiae: dicetque in die illa, Nonne propterea quod
   non est Deus meus in medio mei invenerunt me mala haec?

   18. And I will surely hide my face in that day, for all the evils which
   they shall have wrought, in that they are turned unto other gods.

   18. Ego vero abscondendo abscondam faciem meam in die illa, propter
   omne malum quod fecerit, quod converterit se ad deos alienos.

   19. Now therefore write ye this song for you, and teach it the children
   of Israel: put it in their mouths, that this song may be a witness for
   me against the children of Israel.

   19. Nunc itaque scribite vobis canticum istud, et doce illud filios
   Israelis: pone illud in ore eorum, ut sit mihi canticum istud in testem
   contra filios Israelis.

   20. For when I shall have brought them into the land which I sware unto
   their fathers, that floweth with milk and honey, and they shall have
   eaten, and filled themselves, and waxen fat; then will they turn unto
   other gods, and serve them, and provoke me, and break my covenant.

   20. Introducam enim eum in terram quam juravi patribus ejus, fluentem
   lacte et melle: comedet autem et saturabitur, impinguabitque se: tunc
   convertet se ad deos alienos, et colent eos, vilipendentque me, et
   irritum facient pactum meum.

   21. And it shall come to pass, when many evils and troubles are
   befallen them, that this song shall testify against them as a witness;
   for it shall not be forgotten out of the mouths of their seed: for I
   know their imagination which they go about, even now, before I have
   brought them into the land which I sware.

   21. Quum autem invenerint eum mala plurima, et angustiae, tunc
   respondebit canticum istud in conspectu ejus in testera: non enim
   oblivioni tradetur ab ore seminis ejus, novi enim ingenium ejus, et
   quid ipse faciat hodie antequam introduxerim eum in terram de qua
   juravi.

   22. Moses therefore wrote this song the same day, and taught it the
   children of Israel.

   22. Scripsit itaque Moses canticum istud eo die, et docuit illud filios
   Israelis.

   23. And he gave Joshua the son of Nun a charge, and said, Be strong,
   and of a good courage: for thou shalt bring the children of Israel into
   the land which I sware unto them: and I will be with thee.

   23. Dein praecepit Josuae filio Nun, ac dixit, Fortis esto, et
   roborare, quia tu introduces filios Israel in terram de qua juravi eis:
   et ego ero tecum.

   24. And it came to pass when Moses had made an end of writing the words
   of this law in a book, until they were finished,

   24. Quum autem fecisset finem Moses scribendi verba legis istius in
   libro, donec ea complerentur,

   25. That Moses commanded the Levites, which bare the ark of the
   covenant of the Lord, saying,

   25. Praecepit Moses Levitis portantibus Arcata foederis Jehovae,
   dicendo:

   26. Take this book of the law, and put it in the side of the ark of the
   covenant of the Lord your God, that it may be there for a witness
   against thee.

   26. Capite librum istum legis, et ponite eum in latere arcae foederis
   Jehovae Dei vestri, sitque ibi contra te in testem.

   27. For I know thy rebellion, and thy stiff neck: behold, while I am
   yet alive with you this day, ye have been rebellious against the Lord;
   and how much more after my death?

   27. Ego enim novi rebellionem tuam, et cervicem tuam duram: ecce, adhuc
   me vivente vobiscum hodie rebelles estis Jehovae, et quanto magis
   posteaquam mortuus fuero?

   28. Gather unto me all the elders of your tribes, and your officers.
   that I may speak these words in their ears, and call heaven and earth
   to record against them.

   28. Congregate ad me omnes seniores tribuum vestrarum, et praefectos
   vestres, ut loquar in auribus eorum verba ista, et antester contra eos
   coelum et terram.

   29. For I know that after my death ye will utterly corrupt yourselves,
   and turn aside from the way which I have commanded you; and evil will
   befall you in the latter days; because ye will do evil in the sight of
   the Lord, to provoke him to anger through the work of your hands.

   29. Novi enim postquam mottuus lucre, corrumpendo corrumpetis yes et
   recedetis de via quam praecepi vobis, unde eveniet vobis malum in
   novissimis dierum, quum feceritis malum in oculis Jehovae, irritando
   eum opere mannuum vestrarum.

   30. And Moses spake in the ears of all the congregation of Israel the
   words of this song, until they were ended.

   30. Itaque loquutus est Moses in auribus totius congregationis verba
   cantici hujus, donec ea complerentur.


   14. And the Lord said unto Moses. Joshua is now substituted in the
   place of Moses by a solemn ceremony, not only that he may be held in
   greater reverence by men, but also that he may be presented before God,
   and thus may acknowledge that he is dedicated to His service; for his
   being brought before the door of the tabernacle was a kind of
   consecration; and God also declares that He will give him a charge,
   which is equivalent to saying that He will instruct him in the
   performance of his duties. The appearance also of the glory of God in
   the cloud, was not less effectual for encouraging himself personally,
   than for giving public distinction to his high office. For he would
   never have been recognized as the successor of Moses, unless this
   visible approbation of God had fastened the yoke upon the people.

   16. Behold, thou, shalt sleep with thy fathers. In order that Moses may
   labor more earnestly to retain the people in obedience to God, he is
   reminded of their indomitable perverseness. He had already
   sufficiently, and more than sufficiently, experienced how depraved and
   stubborn was the disposition of the Israelites, and how disobedient and
   contumacious they had been; God now declares that they will be no
   better after his death; nay, that they will indulge themselves in
   greater license in consequence of his absence from them. For it appears
   as if there was an antithesis implied between the words "lie down," and
   "rise up;" [242] as if it were said, As soon as you have gone to rest,
   their insubordination shall break forth, as if they were released from
   all laws. Not, indeed, that this should take place immediately, for
   under Joshua they manifested some humility and submissiveness; at any
   rate, the outward form of pure religion was then maintained, but soon
   afterwards they relapsed into their old habits. And perhaps this
   admonition was useful as a preventative, so that they should not fall
   away so soon.

   Since now we understand the general object which God had in view, it
   will be well briefly to consider the words He employs. When it is said
   to Moses, "Thou shalt sleep with thy fathers," first of all the
   condition of the human race is stated, that Moses may not think it hard
   to depart from the world like all others, since he was born to this
   end. At the same time, the difference is indicated between the death of
   men and of the brute animals. Hence the best consolation is derived,
   for, if our death were total annihilation, we should not be said to
   sleep with our fathers.

   Why the Spirit designates idolatry by the name of "whoring," we have
   seen elsewhere, as also why he calls all false gods "strange," or "of
   the strangers," viz., because, as God chose to be served alone in
   Israel, so he had distinguished Himself by this title, that He was "the
   God of Israel." It is stated in aggravation of their crime, that they
   would not only be led away into the superstitions which they had learnt
   in Egypt, but would also pollute themselves with the defilements of
   Canaan, from which God had willed that it should be purged by their
   hand. These words, then, are to be read emphatically, The people shall
   go a whoring after the gods of the land whither they go, and indeed in
   the midst of it; for it was far more disgraceful to embrace those false
   gods, of which they were the conquerors and judges, than to invent for
   themselves fresh idols.

   Another aggravation of their crime is, also added, that they would
   desert the God by whom they had been adopted as children, and wickedly
   depart from His covenant. For they could not pretend ignorance, when
   they had been again and again so clearly and solemnly warned. Meanwhile
   let us learn from this passage, that whosoever turn away to
   superstitious worships are covenant breakers, and thus, that all their
   pretenses are vain, who profess that they worship the supreme God
   together with idols.

   17. Then my anger shall be kindled against them. By this denunciation
   of punishment, God undoubtedly desired to put a restraint upon the
   senselessness of the people; but since this was done without their
   profiting by it, there was another advantage in this lesson, viz.,
   that, after having been seriously chastised according to their deserts,
   they should at length repent though it might be late. Otherwise these
   punishments would have been inflicted in vain; and it would have never
   suggested itself to their minds that they received the just recompense
   of their ingratitude and perfidiousness. This is indeed the first step
   of prudence, voluntarily to choose that which is right; but the second
   is to beware, when we have listened to admonition, and to make a stand
   against evil. But, if our minds are so blinded, that reproofs and
   threats profit us nothing, there is still a third, i.e., that those who
   have been careless in prosperity should at length begin to perceive
   that they are smitten by God's hand, and thus be driven to acknowledge
   their guilt. Although, therefore, the simple admonition, as long as it
   was not followed by its consequences, was despised by the Israelites;
   still, when they were further instructed by its result, and by
   experience, it produced its fruit; and the same is daily the case with
   ourselves. There is scarcely one in ten of the godly, who, as long as
   God postpones His punishments, anticipates His judgment, but those who
   are aroused from their torpor, seriously consider the threats which
   they had hitherto passed over with indifference, and, being brought
   under conviction, condemn themselves.

   By the word 'phy, ephi, I here rather understand His face than His
   wrath; [243] for the expression is more appropriate; and then he sets
   forth the effect of His wrath, viz., that, being deprived of His aid,
   they shall be overtaken by all sorts of evils, until they are consumed
   and perish. Moreover, He affirms that they should be brought into such
   straits as should extort from them the confession, that the miseries
   which they suffered were tokens of God's alienation from them. But He
   adds, that He would not then listen to their prayers. Hence are we
   taught that, as our happiness depends on God's paternal favor, so there
   is nothing worse for us than to be forsaken by Him, as if He regarded
   us with no further care; and the lesson we are to learn is, that there
   is nothing more desirable for us than that He should honor us with His
   countenance. We read respecting all His creatures, in Psalm 104:29,
   that they are troubled when He hides His face; but here it is more
   clearly perceived that nothing can be imagined more miserable than we
   are, when "our iniquities have separated between us and our God, and
   our sins have hid his face from us, that he will not hear," as Isaiah
   says, (Isaiah 59:2.)

   I have already stated, that the greatness of their miseries is
   expressed, when the people shall confess that they are thus grievously
   afflicted, because God is departed from them; for it was by no light
   punishments that they would be brought to this state of feeling,
   especially considering their great hardness of heart and blind
   obstinacy. It follows then, that severe punishments are indicated, that
   should compel them, though unwillingly, to reflect on God's anger,
   which they had previously taken no account of. Still, this confession
   is not referred to as the fruit or sign of sincere repentance; for, if
   the sinner sincerely flies to God, God will be sure to meet him, since
   he is inclined to mercy. But in this place He declares that He will not
   be favorable to them, but will suffer them to pine away in their
   wretchedness, for God says of Himself that He will "hide His face from
   them," in the 18th verse, with a deeper meaning than just before, in
   that He will take no notice of their groans and lamentations, and by
   the very continuance of their punishments will show how greatly wroth
   with them He is.

   19. Now, therefore, write ye this song. It seems absurd that a useless
   remedy should be applied to an incurable disease. Why does not God
   rather correct their wickedness, and by His Spirit mold their hearts to
   obedience, than pour forth words in vain into their deaf ears? Thus do
   proud and profane men mock at this mode of dealing with them, as if
   God, throwing away His labor, were deluding unhappy men. We must bear
   in mind, however, that the preaching of the word, although it is a
   savior of death to them that perish, is still a sacrifice of sweet
   savior to God; nor is it to be considered thrown away and ineffectual,
   when it convicts the ungodly more and more, and renders them altogether
   inexcusable. And God expressly declares that this would be the use of
   the song as "a witness" against those, from whose mouth it should
   proceed. To some, indeed, it was profitable unto salvation; for, when
   subdued by chastisement, they at length learnt from it that their
   iniquities were the source and cause of all their evils. For, however
   God may redouble the blows of His scourges, unbelievers, who are
   without instruction, reap no advantage from them. Thus, this song was
   the means of assisting the elect to seek after repentance, when they
   were smitten by the hand of God. Still, although the word of God should
   do nothing more than condemn its hearers to death, yet it would be
   enough that it was a sweet savor to Himself. It seems by no means
   accordant with our reason that God should have given this command to
   Isaiah;

   "Go, and tell this people, Hear ye indeed, but understand not; and see
   ye indeed, but perceive not. Make the heart of this people fat, and
   make their ears heavy, and shut their eyes, lest they see with their
   eyes, and hear with their ears, and understand with their heart, and
   convert, and be healed," (Isaiah 6:9, 10)

   but, with respect to the secret judgments of God, whereby all our
   senses must be overwhelmed, let sober-mindedness be our wisdom.

   20. But when I shall have brought them. In other words, God again
   enlarges upon the atrociousness of their iniquity, in that, when He had
   dealt liberally with the Israelites, they would turn His benefits into
   occasions of perversity, since nothing can be more base than such
   ingratitude, he says, then, that He will perform to them, unworthy as
   they are, that which he has sworn, so that He might thus be faithful to
   His promises. He commends the fertility of the land, since this
   striking pledge of His indulgence should have attracted them by its
   sweetness to love so beneficent a Father in return. Hence, therefore,
   the perverseness of their nature is demonstrated, inasmuch as, when
   full, they would kick against Him, like horses which become intractable
   from high feeding. But, after having complained of their future
   rebellion, He again says, that when they shall have been brought into
   sore straits, and overwhelmed with miseries, this song would be "as a
   witness," as if they should proclaim in it their own condemnation.

   When He says that He knew their disposition, [244] or what they forged
   within them, (for the word employed is ytsr, yetzer, which is
   equivalent to figment, or imagination, and includes all the thoughts
   and feelings,) it is apparent that He was by no means unaware how in He
   was bestowing His benefits upon such unworthy persons, but that He thus
   contended with their unworthiness, in order that His goodness might be
   the more conspicuous; and also that He desired this instruction to be
   set before them, ungodly and hopeless as they were, which He knew they
   would despise, so as to render them all the more inexcusable by this
   test. But it may be objected, Why then did He not turn their hearts to
   better things? for thus do ungodly railers allow themselves to dispute
   with Him; but let us rather reflect on the words of Paul, "Nay but, O
   man, who art thou that repliest against God? Hath not the potter power
   over the clay, to make" of it vessels according to his own will?
   (Romans 9:20, 21.) And,

   "Who hath first given to him, and it shall be recompensed
   unto him again?" (Romans 11:35.)

   So will it come to pass, that we shall exclaim with trembling, Oh, how
   deep are the judgments of God; how incomprehensible are His ways!

   That God should judge from their former life what they would be
   hereafter, does not seem very logical; but these two clauses are to be
   taken connectedly, that God foresees that nothing else is to be
   expected from them, but that they would be carried away into sin by
   their unbridled lust; and secondly, that it had already been
   sufficiently manifested by their many iniquities how desperate was
   their obstinacy.

   23. And he gave Joshua the son of Nul, a charge. The more difficult was
   the task of Joshua, the more needful was it that he should be
   encouraged to exert himself, and to beware of failure. For this reason
   his charge is repeated, although in his person all the others were at
   the same time confirmed. Moses grounds it on the promise of God, which
   has been so often mentioned; and says that Joshua had been chosen to
   complete the work of deliverance already begun; for it was hardly
   credible that the disciple should be not only superior to his master,
   but that a man of humble position should be elevated to the dignity
   from which the sovereign Prophet, and God's chief minister, had been
   degraded, unless this was done by the decree and ordinance of God. At
   the same time, however, he makes him more confident of the result of
   his calling, by promising him that God, who was the mover of this
   expedition, would be with him; for He has the power to accomplish every
   work to which He has appointed any one of us.

   24. And it came to pass, when Moses had made an end. By "the words of
   this law," we must understand not only those which are embraced in this
   book, but in the other three also; and there is an implied antithesis
   between the two tables written by God's hand, and the exposition which
   was afterwards added, lest there should be any obscurity respecting
   God's will on account of the brevity with which it was delivered. At
   the very beginning, indeed, God had set forth whatever it was useful
   for them to know, but it was His will that what He had briefly
   comprehended in the Decalogue should be more fully unfolded, and not
   only so, but that it should be also committed to writing, lest it
   should be forgotten. We know how inclined to vanity is the mind of man,
   nay, how willfully it is led away into error by its levity; whilst it
   has other faults also, such as inquisitiveness, and audacity in
   invention, and the love of novelty. Thus religion would have been
   corrupted in a thousand ways, had not its rule been diligently written
   down for posterity. Moreover, since the books of Moses were for a long
   time buried through the carelessness of the people and the priests,
   what darkness of error would have overspread the minds of all, if
   nothing had been written down!

   Since the two Tables were enclosed in the Ark of the Covenant, a place
   at the side was assigned to the interpretation, so that they might have
   no doubt but that it proceeded from the same Divine Author; and, since
   the Decalogue is repeated in these books, it was not at all necessary
   that the Ark should be opened; which was not lawful, because they might
   seek in the books of Moses the instruction which was hidden in the
   Tables. This, indeed, we must remember, that the volume was placed near
   the Ark in token of its dignity, so that, when it was taken from thence
   by the Levites, it might be listened to with greater reverence. When it
   is said, "That it may be there for a witness against thee," this is not
   addressed to the Levites alone, but relates generally to the whole
   people, though the general statement is directed to them as one member
   of the whole body. But further, although the application of its
   doctrine is manifold, still one point only is adverted to; for the Law
   was not written with the single object of being a witness to condemn
   the people, but to be the rule of a pious and holy life, and a
   testimony of God's favor. But, since he had to do with hard and proud
   minds, Moses declares that, whenever its doctrine shall be set forth,
   it will render their perverseness inexcusable.

   27. For I know thy rebellion. The reason is given why he passed over
   the utility of his doctrine, and only cited it as a witness against the
   Israelites in terms of severity and reproach, viz., because he had
   found them by experience to be of a "stiff neck," (of which expression
   I have spoken elsewhere,) and has no confidence that they will be more
   tractable hereafter. He argues from the less to the greater; for, if,
   while such a leader as theirs was alive, they were rebellious, they
   were likely to assume greater audacity when he was dead. For we know of
   what avail is the authority of a great and excellent person to restrain
   the licentiousness of a people. At the same time, Moses does not
   arrogate so much to himself as to say that the good condition of the
   people depended upon his presence, but, pointing out their danger, he
   seeks to render them more obedient after his death.

   28. Gather to me all the elders of your tribes. Special reference is
   here made to the Song, which we gather from the last verse to have been
   alone recited. Moses, indeed, appears to contradict himself when he
   commands the elders and officers only to be called to listen, whereas
   he soon afterwards records that he read it to the whole people. But
   these two things are easily reconciled, when we remember the order
   which he was accustomed to observe in gathering the multitude together;
   for it is manifest from many passages that they were not called
   together promiscuously, but that the heads of tribes, and the princes
   of the people, each of them led their band; so that the assembling of
   the elders here mentioned, is so far from excluding the rest of the
   multitude, that it rather indicates that the whole people were gathered
   together by their tribes and classes. And this we may infer from the
   context, for assuredly he did not "call heaven and earth to record
   against" the officers only; and yet so he seems to signify. Under the
   leaders, therefore, the whole multitude is included.

   The Song of Moses

   It was the perverse nature of the people which extorted from Moses that
   unmixed bitterness with which he again addresses them. Doubtless he
   would have desired to leave a pleasing and joyful recollection of
   himself, and therefore would willingly have exhorted them to the
   performance of their duties, either with blandness, or at any rate with
   placidity, but their stubbornness compelled him to testify his
   indignation in the severity of his address. Besides, he does not judge
   from conjecture what they would do, but expressly declares that he knew
   it for certain, unquestionably because the Spirit, in dictating the
   Song, had also informed him of it. He indicates their revolt by two
   words, corrupting, and turning aside from the way; but, inasmuch as in
   the first there is an ellipsis, for the active verb is used without any
   word for it to govern, some supply "the way of the Lord." I have,
   however, followed a different reading, [245] which seems more correct,
   for the signification of the word is rather passive than transitive. He
   points out the manner of their corruption, declaring that they will
   depart from the way which they had learned; for this was their perfect
   soundness, to obey God, and to follow the way which he showed them. By
   forsaking the Law, then, they were corrupted. Moreover, Moses
   indirectly reproves their ingratitude, inasmuch as he had thrown away
   his labor upon such despisers of pious instruction. Thus he desires
   that this song should be recited by them, in order that, when afflicted
   and half-consumed by miseries, they might at last learn that God is a
   just avenger. And the advantage of this assurance was, that those,
   whose state was not altogether desperate, should at length return to
   their senses; whilst the reprobate should be more and more condemned.

   We have elsewhere seen what it is to call heaven and earth to witness.

   Deuteronomy 32

   Deuteronomy 32:1-52

   1. Give ear, O ye heavens, and I will speak; and hear, O earth, the
   words of my mouth.

   1. Auseultate coeli, et loquar, et audiat terra eloquia oris mei.

   2. My doctrine shall drop as the rain, my speech shall distill as the
   dew; as the small rain upon the tender herb, and as the showers upon
   the grass:

   2. Stillabit, ut pluvia, doctrina mea: stillabit ut ros eloquium meum,
   ut pluviae gramen, et ut irabet super herbam.

   3. Because I will publish the name of the Lord; ascribe ye greatness
   unto our God.

   3. Quia nomen Jehovae invocabo: date magnitudinem Deo nostro.

   4. He is the Rock, his work is perfect; for all his ways are judgment:
   a God of truth, and without iniquity; just and right is he.

   4. Dei perfectum est opus: omnes enim viae ejus judicium: Deus veritas,
   et non est iniquitas, justus et rectus est.

   5. They have corrupted themselves; their spot is not the spot of his
   children: they are a perverse and crooked generation.

   5. Corrupit sese illi, non filii ejus, macula eorum, generatio prava et
   perversa.

   6. Do ye thus requite the Lord, O foolish people and unwise? is not he
   thy father that hath bought thee? hath he not made thee, and
   established thee?

   6. Jehovae retribuitis istud popule stulte et insipiens: nonne ipse est
   pater tuus qui acquisivit te, ipse fecit te, et praeparavit te?

   7. Remember the days of old, consider the years of many generations:
   ask thy father, and he will show thee; thy elders, and they will tell
   thee.

   7. Memento dierum seculi, intellige annos generationis et generationis,
   interroga patrein tuum, annuntiabit tibi: senes tuos, et dicent tibi.

   8. When the Most High divided to the nations their inheritance, when he
   separated the sons of Adam, he set the bounds of the people according
   to the number of the children of Israel:

   8. Quando haereditates distribuit Excelsus gentibus, quando separavit
   filios hominum, statuit terminos populorum pro numero filiorum
   Israelis.

   9. For the Lord's portion is his people; Jacob is the lot of his
   inheritance.

   9. Pars enim Jehovae populus ejus, Jacob sors haereditatis ejus.

   10. He found him in a desert land, and in the waste howling wilderness:
   he led him about, he instructed him, he kept him as the apple of his
   eye.

   10. Invenit eum in terra deserti, et in vastitate horroris deserti:
   circunduxit eum, introduxit eum, custodivit eum, ut pupillam oculi sui.

   11. As an eagle stirreth up her nest, fluttereth over her young,
   spreadeth abroad her wings, taketh them, beareth them on her wings;

   11. Ut aquila quae excitat nidum suum, super pullos suos cubat,
   expandit alas suas, assumit eum, portando super alas suas.

   12. So the Lord alone did lead him, and there was no strange god with
   him.

   12. Jehova solus deduxit eum, et non fuit eum illo deus alienigenae.

   13. He made him ride on the high places of the earth, that he might eat
   the increase of the fields; and he made him to suck honey out of the
   rock, and oil out of the flinty rock;

   13. Equitare fecit eum super excelsa terrae, et comedit fructus agri,
   et fecit ut sugeret mel e petra, et oleum e silice petrae.

   14. Butter of kine, and milk of sheep, with fat of lambs, and rams of
   the breed of Bashan, and goats, with the fat of kidneys of wheat; and
   thou didst drink the pure blood of the grape.

   14. Butyrum bovis, et lac ovium, cum adipe agnorum, et arietes filios
   Basan, et hircos una cum adipe granorum tritici, et sanguinem uvae
   bibisti rubicundum.

   15. But Jeshurun waxed fat, and kicked: thou art waxen fat, thou art
   grown thick, thou art covered with fatness: then he forsook God which
   made him, and lightly esteemed the Rock of his salvation.

   15. Et impinguatus est Rectus, et recalcitravit: impinguatus es,
   in-rassatus es, operuisti: et dereliquit Deum qui fecit eum, ac
   despexit Ileum salutem suam.

   16. They provoked him to jealousy with strange gods, with abominations
   provoked they him to anger.

   16. Provocaverunt eum ad zelum super extraneos, per abominationes
   irritaverunt eum.

   17. They sacrificed unto devils, not to God; to gods whom they knew
   not, to new gods that came newly up, whom your fathers feared not.

   17. Sacrificaverunt daemoniis, non Deo, diis quos non noverant, novis
   qui de propinquo venerunt quos non timuerunt patres vestri.

   18. Of the Rock that begat thee thou art unmindful, and hast forgotten
   God that formed thee.

   18. Dei qui genuit te, oblitus es, oblitus es, inquam, Dei qui creavit
   te.

   19. And when the Lord saw it, he abhorred them, because of the
   provoking of his sons and of his daughters.

   19. Quum autem vidisset Jehova, exacerbatus est irritatione filiorum et
   filiarum suarum.

   20. And he said, I will hide my face from them, I will see what their
   end shall be: for they are a very forward generation, children in whom
   is no faith.

   20. Et dixit, Abscondam faciem meam ab eis, Videbo quid in novissimo
   eorum: generatio enim perversitatum sunt: et filii in quibus nulla est
   fides.

   21. They have moved me to jealousy with that which is not God; they
   have provoked me to anger with their vanities: and I will move them to
   jealousy with those which are not a people; I will provoke them to
   anger with a foolish nation.

   21. Ipsi ad zelum provocaverunt me, in eo quod non est Deus, ad
   iracundiam me provocaverunt in vanitatibus suis: et ego ad zelum
   provocabo eos in eo qui non est populus: in gente stulta provocabo eos
   ad iram.

   22. For a fire is kindled in mine anger, and shall burn unto the lowest
   hell, and shall consume the earth with her increase, and set on fire
   the foundations of the mountains.

   22. Ignis enim succendetur in excandescentia mea, et ardebit usque ad
   infernum inferiorem: devorabitque terram et fructum ejus, et
   inflammabit fundamenta montium.

   23. I will heap mischiefs upon them; I will spend mine arrows upon
   them.

   23. Cumulabo super eos mala, sagittas meas consumam in eis.

   24. They shall be burnt with hunger, and devoured with burning heat,
   and with bitter destruction: I will also send the teeth of beasts upon
   them, with the poison of serpents of the dust.

   24. Combusti erunt fame, et comesti aegritudine calida, et excisione
   amara: dentes quoque bestiarum immittam in eos cum veneno serpentium
   super terram.

   25. The sword without, and terror within, shall destroy both the young
   man and the virgin, the suckling also, with the man of gray hairs.

   25. Foris orbabit gladius, et in cubiculis erit terror: etiam juvenem,
   etiam virginera, lactentem cum viro sene.

   26. I said, I would scatter them into corners, I would make the
   remembrance of them to cease from among men:

   26. Dicerem, Dispergam eos per angulos, cessare faciam ex hominibus
   memoriam eorum.

   27. Were it not that I feared the wrath of the enemy, lest their
   adversaries should behave themselves strangely, and lest they should
   say, Our hand is high, and the Lord hath not done all this.

   27. Nisi iram inimici timerem, ne forte alienos se ostentent hostes
   eorum: ne forte dicant, Manus nostra excelsa, neque Jehova operatus est
   omnia ista.

   28. For they are a nation void of counsel, neither is there any
   understanding in them.

   28. Gens enim perdita consiliis sunt, nec est illis intelligentia.

   29. Oh that they were wise, that they understood this, that they would
   consider their latter end!

   29. Si sapientes essent, intelligerent novissimum suum.

   30. How should one chase a thousand, and two put ten thousand to
   flight, except their Rock had sold them, and the Lord had shut them up?

   30. Quomodo persequutus fuisset unus mille, et duo fugassent decem
   millia, nisi quod Deus eorum vendisset eos, et Jehova tradidisset eos?

   31. For their rock is not as our Rock, even our enemies themselves
   being judges.

   31. Nam non est sient Deus noster, Deus illorum: et inimici nostri sunt
   judices.

   32. For their vine is of the vine of Sodom, and of the fields of
   Gomorrah: their grapes are grapes of gall, their clusters are bitter:

   32. Ex vite enim Sodom est vitis eorum, et ex vitibus Emorrhaeorum uvae
   eorum, uvae veneni, botri amaritudinum sunt eis.

   33. Their wine is the poison of dragons, and the cruel venom of asps.

   33. Venenum draconum, vinum eormn: et venenum aspidum crudele.

   34. Is not this laid up in store with me, and sealed up among my
   treasures?

   34. Nonne est reconditum apud me, obsignatum in thesauris meis?

   35. To me belongeth vengeance and recompense: their foot shall slide in
   due time: for the day of their calamity is at hand, and the things that
   shall come upon them make haste.

   35. Mea est ultio, et retributio, tempore nutabit pes eorum: quia
   propinquus est dies afflictionis eorum, et festinant quae futura sunt
   eis.

   36. For the Lord shall judge his people, and repent himself for his
   servants, when he seeth that their power is gone, and there is none
   shut up, or left.

   36. Quia judicabit Jehova populum suum, et super servos suos poenitebit
   ipsum, quum videbit quod abierit manus, et non sit clausus et
   derelictus.

   37. And he shall say, Where are their gods, their rock in whom they
   trusted;

   37. Et dicet, Ubi sunt dii eorum, deus in quo sperabant?

   38. Which did cat the fat of their sacrifices, and drank the wine of
   their drink-offerings? let them rise up and help you, and be your
   protection.

   38. Qui adipem sacrificiorum illorum comedebant, et bibebant vinum
   libaminis illorum: surgant et opitulentur vobis, sit super vos
   absconsio.

   39. See now that I, even I, am he, and there is no god with me: I kill
   and I make alive; I wound, and I heal: neither is there any that can
   deliver out of my hand.

   39. Videte nunc quod ego, ego suae, et non sunt dii mecum: ego mori
   faciam, et vivere faciam: percutiam, et ego sanabo, et nemo est qui de
   manu mea eruat.

   40. For I lift up my hand to heaven, and say, I live for ever.

   40. Certe levabo ad coelum manum roeare, et dicam, Vivo ego in seculum.

   41. If I whet my glittering sword, and mine hand take hold on judgment,
   I will render vengeance to mine enemies, and will reward them that hate
   me.

   41. Si acuero aciem gladii mei, et arripuerit judiceum manus mea,
   reddam ultionem hostibus meis, et odio habentibus me retribuam.

   42. I will make mine arrows drunk with blood, and my sword shall devour
   flesh; and that with the blood of the slain, and of the captives, from
   the beginning of revenges upon the enemy.

   42. Inebriabo sagittas meas sanguine, et gladius meus devorabit carnem,
   sanguine, inquam, occisorum et captivorum a capite in ultionibus
   inimici.

   43. Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people; for he will avenge the
   blood of his servants, and will render vengeance to his adversaries,
   and will be merciful unto his land, and to his people.

   43. Laudate Gentes populum ejus, quia sanguinem servorum suorum
   vindceabit, et vindictam reddet hostibus suis, et propitius erit terrae
   suae, populo suo.

   44. And Moses came and spake all the words of this song in the ears of
   the people, he and Hoshea the son of Nun.

   44. Venit autem Moses, et recitavit omnia verba cantici istius in
   auribus populi, ipse et Josue filius Nun:

   45. And Moses made an end of speaking all these words to all Israel:

   45. Et finivit Moses recitare omnia verba ista ad universum Israelem:

   46. And he said unto them, Set your hearts unto all the words which I
   testify among you this day, which ye shall command your children to
   observe to do, all the words of this law.

   46. Dixitque illis, Adjicite cor vestrum ad omnia verba quae ego
   testificor adversum vos hodie, ut praecipiatis ea filiis vestris, ut
   custodiant, et faciant omnia verba legis istius.

   47. For it is not a vain thing for you; because it is your life: and
   through this thing ye shall prolong your days in the land whither ye go
   over Jordan to possess it.

   47. Non enim verbum hoc inane a vobis, sed est vita vestra, et per hoc
   verbum prolongabitis dies super terram ad quam possidendam vos
   transitis Jordanem.

   48. And the Lord spake unto Moses that self-same day, saying,

   48. Loquutusque est Jehova ad Mosen eo ipso die, dicendo:

   49. Get thee up into this mountain Abarim, unto mount Nebo, which is in
   the land of Moab, that is over against Jericho, and behold the land of
   Canaan, which I give unto the children of Israel for a possession;

   49. Ascende in montem Abarim istum, montem Neboh, qui eat in terra
   Moab, et qui est e regione Jericho, et vide terram Chenaan, quam ego do
   filiis Israel in haereditatem.

   50. And die in the mount whither thou goest up, and be gathered unto
   thy people; as Aaron thy brother did in mount Hor, and was gathered
   unto his people:

   50. Et morere in monte ad quem ascendis, et congregare ad populos tuos,
   quemadmodum mortuus est Aharon frater tuus in Hor monte, et congregatus
   est ad populos suos.

   51. Because ye trespassed against me among the children of Israel at
   the waters of Meribah-Kadesh, in the wilderness of Zin; because ye
   sanctified me not in the midst of the children of Israel.

   51. Et quod praevaricati estis me in medio filiorum Israelis ad aquas
   jurgii Cades desertl Sin, eo quod non sanctificastis me in medio
   filiorum Israelis:

   52. Yet thou shalt see the land before thee; but thou shalt not go
   thither unto the land which I give the children of Israel.

   52. E regione quidera videbis terram, sed illuc non ingredieris ad
   terram illam quam do filiis Israelis.


   1. Give ear, O ye heavens. Moses commences in a strain of magnificence,
   lest the people should disdain this song with their usual pride, or
   even reject it altogether, being exasperated by its severe censures and
   reproaches. For we well know how the world naturally longs to be
   flattered, and that no strain can be gratifying to it unless it tickles
   and soothes the ear with praise. But Moses here not only inveighs
   bitterly against the vices of the people, but with the utmost possible
   vehemence stigmatizes their perverse nature, their utterly corrupt
   morals, their obstinate ingratitude, and incorrigible contumacy.
   Moreover, he desired that these accusations, whereby he rendered their
   name detestable, should daily echo from their tongues; and thus they
   became still more offensive. It was, therefore, requisite that their
   impatience should be bridled, as it were, in order that they might
   patiently and humbly receive these just reproofs, however severe they
   might be. If, therefore, they should repudiate this song, or should
   turn a deaf ear to it, he declares at the outset that heaven and earth
   would be witnesses of their prodigious obtuseness; nay, he turns and
   addresses himself to heaven and earth, and thus signifies that it was
   worthy of the attention of all creatures, even although they were
   without intelligence or feeling. For it is a hyperbolical mode of
   expression, when he assigns the faculty of hearing, and being
   instructed, to the senseless elements; just as Isaiah, when he would
   intimate that he found none to give heed to him amongst the whole
   people, in like manner appeals to the heavens and the earth, and even
   summons them to bear witness to the prodigious iniquity, that there
   should be less of intelligence amongst the whole people than in oxen
   and asses. (Isaiah 1:2, 3.) For it is but a meager exposition, which
   some give of these words, that they are used, by metonymy, for angels
   and men. [247]

   2 My doctrine shall drop as the rain. Some, as I think improperly, here
   resolve the future tense into the optative mood, [248] for in this
   splendid eulogium he rather celebrates, in order to commend his
   doctrine, the fruitfulness [249] which is actually imparted to it by
   the Holy Spirit, than asks for it to be given to him; and my readers
   must at once perceive that such a request would have been by no means
   seasonable. He therefore compares his speech to rain or dew, as if he
   had said that, if only the people were like the soil in a state of
   softness and preparation, he would deliver doctrine to them which would
   irrigate them unto abundant fruitfulness.

   Although this expression refers especially, and kat ' exochen to the
   Song, still its force and propriety extends to all divine teaching; for
   God never speaks except to render men fruitful in good works, just as,
   by instilling succulency and vigor into the earth by means of rain, He
   makes it fertile for the production of fruit. But, like the rocks and
   stones, which imbibe no moisture from the most abundant rains, so many
   are hindered by their own perversity from being fertilized by spiritual
   irrigation. Wherefore Moses indirectly throws the blame upon the
   Israelites, if the doctrine of this Song should drop upon them in vain.

   3 Because I will publish the name of the Lord. He signifies by these
   words that, if there were any spark of piety in the Israelites, it must
   be manifested by their welcoming this address, wherein the majesty of
   God shines forth. The first clause of the verse, therefore, stands last
   in order, since it is an assignment of a reason for the other. For when
   he exhorts them that they should ascribe to God the glory He deserves,
   he inculcates upon them obedience and attention, as if he had said
   that, unless they reverently submit themselves to his teaching, God
   would be defrauded of this due honor; and this he confirms by adding as
   a reason that he will sincerely and faithfully publish the name of God.
   For the word invoke [250] is not used here as in many other passages,
   but is equivalent to making a profession of God. Moses, then, declares
   himself to be His proclaimer, in order that, under cover of His most
   Holy name, he may awaken attention to his words.

   4. His work is perfect. Those who take these expressions generally, and
   without particular reference to this passage, not only obscure their
   meaning, but also lessen the force of the doctrine they contain. Let
   us, then, understand that the perfection of God's works, the rectitude
   of His ways, etc., are contrasted with the rebellion of the people; for
   if there were anything [251] in God's works imperfect and in arranged,
   if His mode of dealing were deficient in rectitude, if His truth were
   doubtful; if, in a word, there were anything wanting, then there would
   have been a natural excuse why the people should have sought for
   something better than they found in Him, since the desire of obtaining
   that which is best is deserving of no reprehension. Lest, then, the
   Israelites should offer any such pretext, Moses anticipates them.
   Before he begins to treat of the wicked ingratitude of the people, he
   lays down this principle, that they were not induced to transfer their
   affections elsewhere by any deficiency in God. The general statement is
   indeed true in itself, and may be applied to various purposes; but we
   must consider what the object of Moses here is, namely, to remove from
   the people every pretext for their impious and perfidious rebellion,
   and this in order that their amazing folly may be more apparent, when
   they forsake the fountain of living waters, and hew them out cisterns
   with holes in them, as God himself complains in Jeremiah 2:13. We
   perceive therefore, that every honorable distinction which is here
   attributed to God, brands the people with a corresponding mark of
   ignominy, in that they had knowingly and voluntarily deprived
   themselves of the plenitude of all good things, which might have been
   enjoyed by them had they not alienated themselves from God.

   God's work is spoken of, not only with reference to the creation of the
   world, but to the whole course of His providence; as if it were said
   that nothing could be discovered in God's works which could be found
   fault with.

   Now this perfection is not perceptible in every individual thing, for
   even vermin are God's creatures; and amongst men some are blind, some
   lame, some deaf, and others mutilated in one of their members; and many
   fruits also never arrive at maturity. Yet we plainly see that it is
   foolish and misplaced to bring forward such questions as these as
   objections to the perfection of God, here celebrated by Moses, inasmuch
   as the very defects and blemishes of our bodies tend to this object,
   that God's glory may be made manifest. (John 9:3.)

   The next statement, that all his ways are right, [252] conveys a
   similar truth; for it is well known that the word mspht, mishphat, is
   used for rectitude, and works and ways are synonymous.

   The latter part of the verse is a confirmation of the former part,
   since Moses signifies in both that all who censure God may be clearly
   convicted of petulant impiety, since supreme justice shines forth in
   all His acts.

   The words I have rendered, "God is truth," others construe with the
   genitive case, "a God of truth." Either is true, and agreeable to the
   usage of Scripture; but the apposition is more emphatic, which declares
   that God is not only true, but the Truth itself. At any rate, this
   applies to the persons who pay entire allegiance to the word of God,
   for their expectations shall never be frustrated. Thus the people are
   indirectly reproved for their unbelief, in that they deserted God,
   whose faithfulness was not only tried and proved, but who is the very
   fountain of truth.

   Although what follows, that there is no iniquity in God, seems to some
   to have but little force, it is nevertheless of great importance; for
   we well know how often men are so absurd in their subterfuges, as in a
   manner to arraign God instead of themselves; and although they do not
   dare to accuse Him openly, still they do not hesitate to acquit
   themselves, and thus to cast direct obloquy upon Him. Elsewhere,
   therefore, God inquires by His Prophet, "what iniquity the people had
   found in Him?" (Jeremiah 2:5,) and in another place expostulates with
   them, because He was loaded with their hatred and abuse, as if He dealt
   unjustly with such sinners. (Ezekiel 18:2,5.) When, therefore, He
   vindicates Himself from such calumnies, it follows that no blame
   attaches itself to Him, but that the wickedness of those who turn away
   from Him is abundantly condemned.

   5. They have corrupted themselves. Moses now inveighs unhesitatingly
   against the perfidy of the people, and gives loose to the most
   unmeasured upbraidings; for if God be just and true, then it was plain
   enough that the Israelites were a depraved and perverse nation. This
   perverse nation, he says, has corrupted itself towards Him, namely Him,
   whom he has just lauded for His perfect justice and faithfulness; and
   he accuses them of having basely prostituted to every sort of sin the
   chastity which they had promised to God. There is no doubt but that
   they were sorely wounded by these epithets, and would have been
   transported with rage, had they not seen that God's incomparable
   servant, when he had now been called upon to die by God's command,
   spoke as it were from heaven. The voice, therefore, of the dying man
   restrained their pride, so that they did not now dare to oppose him as
   a mortal; and afterwards, when the condemnation had been assented to by
   public authority, and by general accord, they were less at liberty to
   vent their madness against it. He introduces, by way of anticipation,
   the statement that they were not His children; for else they might
   obviously have made the objection that the sacred race of Abraham,
   which God had adopted, should be dealt with less reproachfully. Moses,
   therefore, declares that they are not children, because they are a
   perverse nation. For although their adoption always stood firm, still
   its efficacy was restricted to the elect part of them, so that God,
   without breaking His covenant, might reject the general body. But to
   explain the matter more clearly, it must be borne in mind that the
   Spirit, on different grounds, at one time assigns the name of God's
   children to hypocrites, at another takes it away; for sometimes it is
   an aggravation of their criminality, when they are called the children
   of Abraham and Jacob as well as of God, an instance of which will soon
   occur. Here, however, in order that they may cease to glory without
   cause, they are said not to be children, because they are degenerate,
   and therefore disinherited by God, so as no longer to retain their
   honorable position. In this sense Moses declares that they are not
   children, as having cast off God from being their Father. It is added
   this was done with their spot (or disgrace; [253] ) unless it be
   thought preferable to take it that. they were corrupted by their spots,
   or by their sins, to which I willingly assent; although I do not reject
   the other sense, namely, that their alienation from God had rendered
   them ignominious, or that they had contracted the stain of disgrace by
   their faithlessness.

   6. Do ye thus requite the Lord. In order to expose the ingratitude of
   the people to greater infamy, he now begins to commemorate the benefits
   whereby God had laid them under obligation to Himself: for the more
   liberally God deals with us, the more earnest ought to be the piety
   awakened in our hearts; nay, His goodness, as soon as we have tasted of
   it, ought to draw us at once to Him. Now God, although he has been
   always bountiful towards the whole human race, had, in a peculiar
   manner showered down an immense abundance of His bounty upon that
   people; this, then, Moses alleges, and shows how basely ungrateful they
   had been. He first expostulates with them interrogatively, asking them
   whether this was a fitting return for God's especial blessings; and
   then proceeds to enumerate them. He inquires of them, then, whether God
   was not their father, from the time when He had honored them with the
   distinction of His adoption: and under this single head he comprehends
   many things, because from this source proceeded whatever blessings God
   had conferred upon them. Not, however, to examine every point with the
   accuracy it deserves, what more binding obligation could be imagined
   than that God should have chosen one nation for Himself out of the
   whole world, whose father He should be by special privilege? For,
   although all human beings, since they were created in the image of God,
   are sometimes called His children, still to be accounted His children
   was the special privilege of the sons of Abraham. And, in order to
   prove that this was not a natural, but an acquired dignity, Moses
   immediately afterwards explains in what way God was their Father: viz.,
   that he purchased, made, and prepared them. The foundation and origin,
   then, was the gratuitous good pleasure of God, when He took them to be
   His own peculiar people. Elsewhere, indeed, His second purchase of them
   is mentioned, when He redeemed them from Egypt; here, however, Moses
   goes back farther, viz., to the covenant made with Abraham, whereby
   they were separated from other nations, as will presently more clearly
   appear. I reject, as not in harmony with the context, the translation
   which some give of the word, qnh, kanah, i.e., to possess. [254]

   In the same sense it is added, that they were made by God: which does
   not. refer to the general creation, but only to the privilege of
   adoption, whereby they became God's new work, and in which another form
   was imparted to them; in which sense also He is called their framer, or
   Maker. Elsewhere, also, when the Prophet says,

   "Know ye that the Lord he is God: it is he that hath made us, and not
   we ourselves," (Psalm 100:3,)

   he undoubtedly magnifies that special prerogative, whereby God had
   distinguished the sons of Abraham above all other races. For, since the
   fall of Adam had brought disgrace upon all his posterity, God restores
   those, whom He separates as His own, so that their condition may be
   better than that of all other nations. At the same time it must be
   remarked, that this grace of renewal is effaced in many who have
   afterwards profaned it. Consequently the Church is called God's work
   and creation, in two senses, i.e., generally with respect to its
   outward calling, and specially with respect to spiritual regeneration,
   as far as regards the elect; for the covenant of grace is common to
   hypocrites and true believers. On this ground all whom God gathers into
   His Church, are indiscriminately said to be renewed and regenerated:
   but the internal renovation belongs to believers only; whom Paul,
   therefore, calls God's "workmanship, created unto good works, which God
   hath prepared," etc. (Ephesians 2:10.) The same is the tendency of the
   third word, which may, however, be taken for to "establish;" [255]
   although I have preferred to follow the more received sense, viz, that
   God had prepared His people, as the artificer fashions and fits his
   work.

   7 Remember the days of old. This is an explanation of the preceding
   verse, for Moses again shows how God had acquired this people, viz.,
   because he had chosen to separate them from other nations according to
   His own good pleasure. But, since the Israelites might be inflated by
   their present superiority, they are reminded of their origin, and Moses
   commands them not to consider what they now are, but also from whence
   they had been taken, and with this view he says, Remember the old
   times; ask the elders, etc. For we know how men, when they do not
   reflect that whatever they have, proceeded from God, and is held, as it
   were, at will, are blinded by their dignity, so as not only to despise
   others, but also to exalt themselves against, the Author of all good
   things. Moses, in order to subdue this arrogance, says that all peoples
   were alike under the hand and power of God, and thus that their
   diversity was not in their original nature, but derived from elsewhere,
   i.e., from God's free choice. In the word vhnchl, behanchel, there is
   some ambiguity: for some translate it, When the Most High divided the
   earth to the nations; and, though I do not reject this, still I have
   preferred the meaning more in accordance with the context; [256] for
   Moses says the same thing twice over, and the second clause is the
   explanation of the first. He says, therefore, that God distributed the
   nations, as an inheritance is divided; and then this is more clearly
   repeated, when he mentions the separation of the sons of Adam. When, in
   the latter part of the verse, it is said, that He set bounds to the
   nations according to the number of the children of Israel, it is
   commonly explained that He set bounds to the nations in such sort, that
   the habitation of the sons of Abraham was secured to them. Some of the
   Hebrews take it in a more restricted sense, viz., that in the
   distribution of the world, so much was given to the seven nations of
   Canaan as should be sufficient for the children of Israel. In my
   opinion, however, his meaning is, that in the whole arrangement of the
   world, the object which God had in view was to provide for His elect
   people: for, although His bounty extended to all, still He had such
   regard for His own, that, chiefly on their account, His care also
   extended to others. The word number is expressly employed; as if Moses
   had said, that, however small a portion of the human race the
   posterity, of Abraham might be, nevertheless that number was before
   God's eyes, when He ordered the state of the whole world; unless it be
   preferred to take the word msphr, misphar, [257] for a ratio; but it
   will not be unsuitable to the passage to understand it that this small
   body was so precious to God, that he arranged the whole distribution of
   the world with a view to their welfare. Some refer it to the calling of
   the Gentiles, as if Moses had said that the empire of the whole world
   was destined to the seed of Abraham, because it was to be propagated
   through all the regions of the world; but this is altogether erroneous,
   for nothing is here indicated but the distinction, formerly conferred
   upon one nation. [258]

   9 For the Lord's portion is his people. This is the main point, that
   God was moved by nothing but His own good pleasure to make so much of
   this people, who had been derived from a common origin with all others:
   for when he says, that Jacob was the portion of Jehovah, and the lot of
   His inheritance, he does not mean that there was anything better in
   them than in others, but he assigns the reason why God preferred this
   one nation to the rest of mankind; viz., because He took it to Himself
   as His hereditary portion, which dignity depends upon His gratuitous
   election.

   10. He found him in a desert land. If the intention of Moses had been
   to record all the instances of God's paternal kindness towards the
   people, he must have commenced from the time of Abraham; like the
   prophet who, when presenting a complete narrative in the Psalm, begins
   from that original covenant, which God had made with the fathers,
   (Psalm 105:8;) and also introduces the benefits which He had conferred
   upon them, when they were but few in number, and strangers in the land,
   when they went from one nation to another, yet he suffered no man to do
   them wrong, and reproved kings for their sakes. (Psalm 105:14.) But
   Moses, studying brevity, deemed it sufficient to bring forward a more
   recent and more notorious blessing; nay, he omits the early part of
   their deliverance, and only makes mention of the desert, he says, then,
   that God found them in the desert; not because He then first began to
   take pity upon them, since they had been previously rescued from the
   tyranny of Pharaoh by His marvelous power, and had passed the Red Sea
   dry-shod, but because it was profitable for them to have set before
   their eyes how they had been extricated from the deep abyss of death,
   in order that they might more readily acknowledge this to have been, as
   it were, the beginning of their life. For what was that waste and
   barren desert, in which not a crumb of bread, nor a drop of water was
   to be found, but a grave to swallow up a thousand lives? and,
   therefore, it is further called "the devastation of horror." [259] The
   suae is, that it was a kind of type of resurrection, not from one death
   only, but from innumerable deaths, that the people should have escaped
   from it in safety. That they should have done so, even had their march
   through it been straight and speedy, could not have been the case
   without a miracle; but, inasmuch as they wandered therein for forty
   years, our minds can hardly comprehend a hundredth part of the miracles
   (which followed one upon the other. [260] ) Thus the word "led about,"
   is not superfluous, for God's power was far more conspicuous than as if
   they had flown swiftly through the air. I apply the same meaning to
   what follows, "he instructed him;" for some, in my opinion improperly,
   refer it to the Law, [261] whereas it rather relates to the teaching of
   experience. For there was manifold, and no ordinary instruction in all
   these acts of bounty and punishment, wherein God, as it were, put forth
   His hand, and manifested His glory.

   Two similitudes follow, to express God's love, mingled with solicitude
   more than paternal. First, he says, that God no less anxiously
   protected them from all injury and annoyance than every one is wont to
   protect the pupil of his eye, which is the most tender part of the
   body, and against the injury of which the greatest precautions are
   taken. And David also, when requesting that he may be kept safe under
   the special guardianship of God, uses the same expression. (Psalm
   17:8.) Secondly, God compares Himself to an eagle, which not only
   fosters her young ones under her outspread wings, but also indulgently,
   and with maternal tenderness tempts them to fly. It would be
   unseasonable to enter here into more subtle philosophical discussions
   respecting the nature of the eagle. The Jews, who are wont to trifle
   hazardously with things they do not understand, have invented fables
   respecting this passage, which have no relation to the meaning of
   Moses, who unquestionably spoke of the eagle as he might of any other
   bird. Nor can it be doubted but that Christ, when He compares Himself
   to a hen, desired to express the same sedulous care.

   "How often (he says) would I have gathered thy children together, even
   as a hen gathereth her chickens under her wings, and ye would not!"
   (Matthew 23:37.)

   If, however, any should choose to apply here, what Aristotle writes
   respecting the eagle, I would not stand in his way: although I do not
   think Moses had anything in his mind, beyond what the words naturally
   express. And, surely that which at once occurs to us ought to be
   sufficient for us, viz., that we ought to be ravished with just.
   admiration of God's inestimable goodness and indulgence, when He
   condescends so to stoop to us as to protect us with His wings, like a
   bird, and, hovering before us, to instruct and accustom us to follow
   Him: in which latter words a more than maternal anxiety to teach us is
   represented.

   12. So the Lord alone did lead hive. This is spoken by anticipation, in
   order to take away every pretext from the Israelites, provided they
   should seek, according to their custom, to mingle their superstitions
   with the pure service of God. For, when they were bringing in, from all
   quarters, gods of various nations, this was the excuse they commonly
   made, that God was not thus despoiled of His due honor: and hence it
   came to pass, that they permitted themselves to heap together a
   multitude of false gods, whom they worshipped as their patrons. But
   Moses anticipates them, and declares that God, as having no need of
   external aid, had not associated with Himself any strange gods in His
   preservation of the people. Hence it follows, that whatever gods the
   people introduced, they transferred to them the honor due to the one
   true God. Let us then learn from this passage, that, unless God be
   served without a rival, religion is altogether perverted by the impious
   admixture.

   13. He made him ride on the high places. Theirs is but a frivolous
   imagination, who suppose that Judea was so called as being the navel or
   center of the earth; [262] it is more likely that it was called high in
   reference to Egypt; and, indeed, it is by no means an unusual
   expression, that those who go into Egypt, are said to go down, and
   those who come into Judea to come up. Still I am rather disposed Lo
   think that by height he denotes its excellency; inasmuch as that land,
   on account of its illustrious endowments, was, as it were, the most
   noble theater in the world.

   Moses celebrates its fertility, when he says that the people sucked
   honey from the rock and oil from the stones: for he means to indicate,
   that no part of it was unproductive, since they gathered honey from the
   rocks, and upon them also the olive grew. The same is the intention of
   the other figures, that they ate "butter of kine, and milk of sheep;"
   by which he signifies that the land was full of rich pastures. By "fat
   of lambs," he undoubtedly means the plumpness of their flesh, because
   it was not lawful to eat their actual fat; but it is not unusual to
   denote by this word any kind of richness, as soon afterwards he calls
   the best meal or flour, from which the more delicate kind of bread was
   made, "the fat of wheat." With respect to the wine, he magnifies God's
   liberality by the use of a poetic figure, when he says they drank of
   the blood of the grape. There is no doubt but that he alludes to its
   color; yet he takes occasion to extol more highly the beneficence of
   God, by intimating that, when the juice of the grapes is expressed, it
   is just as if their blood flowed forth for the nutriment of men. Since,
   then, the metaphor is taken from the redness of wine, I have not
   hesitated to translate the epithet chmr, chamer, at the end of the
   verse, red. [263] From many passages it appears to have been very
   delicious; and in Isaiah 27:2 the word chmr, chamer, is used for a vine
   of great preciousness and of exquisite flavor. Those who render it
   pure, have rather taken into consideration the fact, than the
   signification of the word.

   15 But Jeshurun [264] waxed fat. Moses here severely censures the
   ingratitude of the people, because when filled with delicacies, they
   began to wax wanton against God; for, according to the vulgar proverb,
   satiety breeds violence; but this arises from men's detestable
   depravity, who ought rather to be inclined to humility and gentleness
   by the loving-kindness of God, since the more abundantly He supplies us
   with food, the more does He invite us to show forth the affection that
   becomes children, inasmuch as He thus more closely and familiarly
   declares Himself to be our Father. Intolerable, then, is the impiety of
   profane persons, who increase in insolence against Him, when they have
   gorged themselves with an abundance of all good things. They are here
   compared to restive horses, which, if they are well fed, without
   exercise, kick under their rider, and are rendered almost intractable.
   By using the word "upright" for Israel, he ironically taunts them with
   having departed from rectitude, and, reminding them of the high dignity
   conferred upon them, more severely reproves their sin of
   unfaithfulness. For elsewhere [265] Israel is honored with the same
   title without any evil imputation in respect to their calling; but here
   Moses reproachfully shows them how far they had departed from the
   pursuit of that piety, to the cultivation of which they had been
   called.

   16 They provoked him to jealousy. It is only figuratively that jealousy
   is attributed to God, who is free from all passions; but, since men
   never sufficiently reflect how great pollution they contract by their
   idolatries, it is necessary that the grossness of the sin should be
   expressed in such terms as this, implying that men do no less injury to
   God, when they transfer to others the honor due to Him, and that the
   offense is no lighter than as if a licentious woman should provoke her
   husband's mind to jealousy, and inflict a wound upon him by running
   after adulterers. This jealousy has reference to the sacred and
   spiritual marriage, whereby God had bound His people to Himself. The
   suae is, that the Israelites were as insulting to God by their
   superstitions as if they had designedly provoked Him.

   In the next verse an amplification follows, viz., that they had
   transferred to devils the worship due to God alone. By the general
   consent of all nations God ought to be worshipped by sacrifices; for,
   although the Gentiles invented for themselves divers gods, still the
   persuasion continued to prevail, that this service was the peculiar
   prerogative of Deity. Nothing, then, could be more disgraceful or
   detestable than to rob God of His honor, and to offer it to demons.
   This, indeed, would never have been admitted by the Israelites,
   inasmuch as they pretended that their minor gods were their advocates
   with the supreme and only Creator of the world, and did not hesitate to
   account as rendered to Him whatever they shared among their idols.
   Here, however, He first of all repudiates all such mixtures whereby His
   holy name is unworthily profaned, and suffers Himself not to be
   associated with idols; and, secondly, by whatever titles they may
   dignify their idols, He declares all false gods to be demons. Hence it
   follows that the sacrifices made to them are infected with sacrilege.
   Both of these points are worthy of careful remark, viz., that God
   abominates all corruptions of His service; and also, that whatever
   names the world may invent for its gods, they are so many masks, under
   which the devil hides himself for the deception of the simple.

   Furthermore, Moses reproves the folly of the Israelites in having
   promiscuously devoted themselves to unknown gods; just as an adulterous
   woman might prostitute herself indiscriminately to all comers. When he
   says that they came from near, [266] it has reference to time, and is
   equivalent to saying that they had lately sprung up. Thirdly, it is
   said, that these gods were not honored by their fathers; for thus their
   perverse love of novelty is proved against them, inasmuch as they had
   not been even led by imitation of their fathers, but in their restless
   innovation had procured for themselves new and unwonted gods. Not that
   the law of piety is founded on antiquity alone, as if it were
   sufficient to follow the customs handed down by our ancestors; for thus
   any of the religions of the Gentiles might be proved true, but because
   the genuine and faithful tradition of their fathers would be the sure
   and approved rule for the worship of God. For Moses assumes a higher
   principle, viz., that their fathers were truly and most unmistakably
   instructed who was the one and only God, in whom alone they ought to
   trust. Yet a distinction is here to be drawn between these holy fathers
   and the reprobate; for the imitation of their fathers, which here seems
   to be deemed praiseworthy, is elsewhere severely condemned, because the
   Jews were carried away, without discrimination, after the bad examples
   of their fathers. Moses, therefore, here refers to no other fathers
   than those who were in a position to hand down what they had learned
   from God Himself. The word fear often comprises, by synecdoche, the
   whole service of God, and sometimes is applied to outward ceremonies:
   the word sr, sagnar however, is here used, which means properly to
   stand in awe of, or to dread; [267] but still in the same sense.

   18. Of the Rock [268] that begat thee. He again aggravates the
   criminality of the people by referring to their ingratitude, inasmuch
   as they did not fall through ignorance, but willfully stifled that
   knowledge of God, which ought to have shone brightly in all their
   hearts: for this is the effect of the reproach, that they were
   unmindful of their Rock: as much as to say, that they would never have
   given themselves up to their impious superstitions, unless they had
   cast into voluntary oblivion that God whom, by the most conspicuous
   proofs, they had experimentally found to be the foundation and support
   of their salvation.

   19. And when the Lord saw it. The seeing of God, which is mentioned
   here, has reference to His forbearance in judgment: as if it were said,
   that He does not act hastily, and is not alienated from His children,
   without having duly weighed their case; in the same way as it is said
   elsewhere: "Because the cry of Sodom is great, I will go down now and
   see whether" it is so, and "I will know." (Genesis 18:20, 21) Assuredly
   God has no need to make any examination, since nothing escapes His
   eyes, however hidden it may be; but this going down and inquiring is
   contrasted with preposterous haste. Thus in this passage Moses shows
   that God was wroth, when he saw His sons and His daughters drawn away
   so faithlessly after their idols. Again, when he calls them God's
   children, he does not judge them to be so on account of their merits,
   but in reference to God's adoption, which, although it was canceled as
   regarded themselves, still had the effect of aggravating the guilt of
   their ingratitude. And for the same reason that he had just. said that
   God saw them, Moses introduces Him deliberating, as it were, that the
   time for punishing them might be perceived to be fully come. But we
   must notice the degrees; for God does not at once break forth into
   extreme severity, but is said to hide His face, that He might secretly
   consider what they would do: since this is a middle course between the
   manifest exhibition of His grace and favor, and the tokens of His
   wrath. God is, indeed, elsewhere said, in many passages, to hide His
   face, when He rejects men's prayers, and withdraws His aid; but here He
   assumes the character of a man who, when he sees that he produces no
   effect by acting, [269] goes aside to some place, from whence he may
   quietly contemplate the result, And thus God's weariness of them is
   expressed; for when He at length saw that His efforts to control them
   were thrown away, He abandoned the care of them. It is a false
   inference, which some draw from hence, that men, when forsaken by God,
   recover themselves by the exercise of their own free-will; as if God
   sat calmly and inactively in a watch-tower expecting what they may do;
   inasmuch as this hiding of Himself has reference only to the outward
   manifestation of His grace. In a word, it is a similitude taken from
   the conduct of men, whereby God signifies that He is overcome with
   weariness, and will no more be the leader and guardian of the people,
   until it shall effectually appear that they are altogether intractable.
   And this is gathered from the reason, which is presently added, wherein
   He censures their forward nature and want of faith, as much as to say,
   that, after long trial, nothing remained for Him but to abandon them.

   21. They have moved me to jealousy. He now proceeds further, viz., that
   God, after having withdrawn Himself for a time, would, at length be the
   open enemy of the people, so as to repay them in kind. And he points
   out the mode of this retaliation, that as they had insultingly brought
   into antagonism with God empty phantoms and vanities, so on His part,
   He would exalt against them barbarous and worthless nations. This
   similitude is also taken from jealous husbands, who, when they perceive
   themselves to be despised by their adulterous wives, avenge themselves
   by their own amours. Why God should attribute to Himself the feeling of
   jealousy has been explained under the Second Commandment; Moses now
   only shows that it would be a most equitable mode of revenge, that God
   should insult, by means of despised and ignoble nations, those
   apostates, who had made to themselves idols in disparagement of Him.

   The fulfillment of this sentence was manifested from time to time, when
   they were tyrannically oppressed by the neighboring nations. It is
   true, indeed, that the Egyptians, the Assyrians, and the Chaldeans were
   included among those people of nought and foolish nations, although
   they were preeminent in power and wealth, and famous for other splendid
   endowments; but it is no matter of surprise that, in comparison with
   that dignity which God had conferred upon the Israelites, all other
   nations should be accounted but refuse. The suae is, that God's
   vengeance was ready whereby He would punish the vanities of His people,
   inasmuch as He could create out of nothing the enemies by whom they
   should be reduced to nothing. There is much elegance in the allusion of
   Paul, in which he extends this sentence further, inasmuch as, when God
   introduced the Gentiles into His Church, He stirred up the Jews to
   jealousy, in order that they might be led to repentance by a sense of
   their ignominy. Surely the calling of the Gentiles was exactly as if He
   created shadows, whom he might prefer to His reprobate people. (Romans
   10:19.)

   22. For a fire is kindled in mine anger. He confirms what went before,
   but more generally; for He compares His anger to a burning fire, which
   should penetrate to the deepest abysses, and should utterly consume
   their land, so as not to spare the very roots of the mountains. This
   metaphor is, indeed, of frequent occurrence; but here more is expressed
   by it than in other passages. In the same sense also it is presently
   added, that God would spend all his scourges and arrows upon them;
   since, when His implacable anger is once aroused, there are no bounds
   to His severity. The verb 'sphh aspheh, may, however, also be taken for
   to heap, or to superadd; [270] but I willingly follow the more received
   interpretation, viz., that God will not omit anything to destroy them,
   as if He would apply to this purpose all weapons which were at hand.

   24. They shall be burnt with hunger. He now descends to some particular
   modes of punishment, not, indeed, to enumerate them all, but only to
   adduce such specimens of them as to inspire the people with greater
   terror, inasmuch as mere generalities would not have sufficiently
   affected them. He mentions three especial scourges, pestilence, famine,
   and the sword, on which the prophets constantly dilate, when their
   object was to apply the Law to the actual use of the people, from
   whence it arose that they familiarly employ many of the expressions
   used by Moses. He introduces indeed other punishments, which the
   prophets also mention; but the sum of what he says is this, that the
   Israelites should feel that God was armed with all the punishments
   which were only too well known by experience, and by them would utterly
   destroy them.

   First., he says, that they should be dried up, or rather roasted with
   hunger. [271] Instead of pestilence he uses the words burning
   (uredinem,) and bitter destruction: and before he speaks of the sword,
   declares that He would send forth beasts and serpents, so that on the
   one hand, open violence should assail them, and, on the other, secret
   wiles. Amos has also imitated this figure:

   "The day of the Lord (he says) is darkness and not light: as if a man
   did flee from a lion and a bear met him; or went into the house, and
   leaned his hand on the wall, and a serpent bit him."
   (Amos 5:18, 19.)

   To war, and the cruelty of enemies he adds another evil, viz., terror:
   and this is, indeed, an aggravation worse than death itself, when we
   tremble within with terror, for it would be better to be slain ten
   times over bravely fighting in battle, than to be consumed with
   constant fear, as by a lingering death. [272]

   Let us learn, then, from this passage, that, whatever perils surround
   us, and whatever adversities, they are God's weapons, and that they do
   not occur by chance to this or that person, but are directed by His
   hand. Thus it is the case that He not; only stirs up enemies against
   us, but fierce and noisome beasts also; that He shuts up the heaven and
   the earth; that He infects the atmosphere with deadly disease; that, in
   a word, he draws forth from all the elements manifold means of
   destruction.

   But if it be the fact, that the godly are involved in similar
   punishments, since they suffer from hunger and want, and are not exempt
   from any evil; for even Paul acknowledges that he had himself
   experienced what God here denounces against those that wickedly despise
   Him, for he says that he was troubled without with fightings, and
   within with fears, (2 Corinthians 7:5;) we must bear in mind that all
   adversities are in themselves signs of God's wrath, since they derive
   their origin from sin; but that through God's marvelous provision it
   comes to pass, that to believers they are exercises of their faith and
   proofs of their patience. Hence we often see God's children afflicted
   in common with the ungodly, but to a different end; though nevertheless
   all adversities are proofs of God's wrath against the reprobate. On
   this point I have spoken at greater length in treating of the curses of
   the Law.

   26. I said, I would scatter them. God again represents Himself in the
   character of a man, as if He were meditating opposite determinations,
   and restrained His vehemence in consideration of the impediments He
   encountered. What it amounts to, however, is this, that God suspended
   His final judgment upon them for no other reason but because He had
   regard to His own glory, which would else have been subjected to the
   taunts of the Gentiles. Hence the Jews were reminded that, whereas they
   had deserved certain destruction, they were preserved on no other
   grounds but because God was unwilling to give the reins to the
   insolence of the Gentiles. The expression wrath, is here used for
   arrogant boasting, because in their prosperity ungodly and profane men
   burst forth into cruelty; unless it be preferred to render it simply
   irritation, [273] in which sense it is used in 2 Kings 23. Immediately
   afterwards it is explained, "lest the adversaries should behave
   themselves strangely." nkr, nacar, signifies sometimes to be strange,
   sometimes to put on a different face, sometimes to acknowledge. Thus I
   do not doubt but that Moses meant to express the arrogance of those who
   in a manner transform themselves that they may dazzle the eyes of the
   simple by their pomp and empty exaltation. If any approve of a
   different sense, i.e., lest they should separate themselves from God,
   and arrogate to themselves what belongs to Him alone, I make no
   objection: and this, indeed, seems to agree with what follows, [274]
   "Our high hand, and not the Lord, has done this:" for when men indulge
   in such unbridled license, they go so far astray as to have nothing in
   common with God. Thus the judgment of God, which should have been
   conspicuous in these punishments, would have been put out of sight,
   when the enemies appropriated to themselves the glory of the people's
   destruction. Nevertheless the ungodly did not cease to pride themselves
   on their victories, (as God complains by Isaiah, and Habakkuk
   confirms;) [275] although their insolence was in some measure
   repressed, as long as there were some remnants of the elect people
   preserved. [276]

   It is only figuratively that God says, he feared this insolence, which
   He might have easily remedied and restrained: but I have already
   stated, that He speaks after the manner of men, to show the Israelites
   that they escaped rather on account of their enemies, than by their own
   merits. The question, however, arises, how such a consultation as this
   could have taken place after God had determined to consume them with
   the fire of His wrath; [277] I reply, that the consumption there
   indicated was not such as totally to annihilate the nation, so that no
   ruins should remain as witnesses of their former state; whereas He now
   speaks of the destruction, which should altogether blot out the name of
   the nation, as if it had never been chosen by God.

   28. For they are a nation void of counsel. The cause is assigned why
   God had almost blotted out altogether the memory of the people, viz.,
   because their faculty was incurable: for He does not merely indicate
   that their conduct was rash and inconsiderate, because they lacked
   reason mid discretion: but that they could be by no means brought to
   their senses, and, in fact, that not one drop of sagacity existed in
   them. The proof of this immediately follows, viz., that the tokens of
   God's wrath were too clearly set before their eyes to escape their
   notice, unless they were utterly blind and stupid. The word lv, lu,
   which they render, "Would that" [278] (utinam,) denotes commiseration
   rather than desire; and therefore it may be properly translated, "Oh,
   if they understood," etc.

   By the expression, "latter," their exceeding stupidity is censured:
   since not even by many and long experiences were they aroused to
   reflect on the causes of their calamities; whereas length of time
   extorts some sense at last from the very dullest, and almost idiotic
   persons. It was, therefore, a sign of desperate stupidity that they
   were still without understanding after so many years; as if by
   experience itself they had grown callous, when they ought to have
   shaken off their lethargy, and to have bestirred themselves to earnest
   inquiry. Justly, then, does Moses reproach them with not having
   considered even at the latter end; for not once only, nor in a single
   year, but by constant inflictions of punishment during a long series of
   years, had they been instructed without profit.

   30. How should one chase a thousand. Of all the many tokens of God's
   wrath, he selects one which was peculiarly striking; for as long as God
   was on their side, they had put to flight mighty armies, nor had they
   been supported by any multitude of forces. Now, when, though in great
   numbers, they are conquered by a few, this change plainly shows that
   they are deprived of God's aid, especially when a thousand, who were
   wont before, with a little band, to rout the greatest armies, gave way
   before ten men. Moses, therefore, condemns the stupidity of the people,
   in that it does not occur to their minds that they are rejected by God,
   when they are so easily overcome by a few enemies, whom they far exceed
   in numbers. Moses, however, goes still further, and says, that they
   were sold and betrayed; [279] inasmuch as God, having so often found
   them to be unworthy of His aid, not only deserted them, but made them
   subject to heathen nations, and, as it were, sold them to be their
   slaves. This threat is often repeated by the prophets: and Isaiah,
   desiring to awake in them a hope of deliverance, tells them that God
   would redeem the people whom He had sold. [280] But, in case any should
   object that it was no matter of wonder, if the uncertain chance of war
   should confer on others the victory which often, as a profane poet
   says,

   "Hovers between the two on doubtful wings," [281]

   Moses anticipates the objection by declaring that, unless the people
   should be deprived of God's aid, they could not be otherwise than
   successful. A comparison is therefore instituted between the true God
   and false gods: as though Moses had said that, where the God of hosts
   presides, the issue of war can never be doubtful. Hence it follows,
   that God's elect and peculiar people are exempted from the ordinary
   condition of nations, except in so far as it deserves to be rejected on
   the score of its ingratitude. He calls the unbelievers themselves to be
   the arbiters and witnesses of this, inasmuch as they had often
   experienced the formidable power of God, and knew assuredly that the
   God of Israel was unlike their idols. It is, then, just as if he had
   said, that this was conspicuous even to the blind, or were to cite as
   witnesses those who are blessed with no light from on high. In thus
   inviting unbelievers to be judges, it is not as if he supposed that
   they would pronounce what was true, and thoroughly understood by them,
   but because they must needs be convinced by experience: for, if any one
   had asked the heathen whether the supreme government and power of
   heaven and earth were in the hands of the One God of Israel, they never
   would have confessed that their idols were mere vanity. Still, however
   malignantly they might detract from God's glory, Moses does not
   hesitate to boast, even themselves being judges, that God had
   magnificently exerted His unconquered might; although he refers rather
   to the experience of facts themselves, than to their feelings. Other
   commentators extract a different meaning, viz., that although
   unbelievers might be victorious, still God remained unaffected by it:
   neither was his arm broken, because he permitted them to afflict the
   apostate Israelites: [282] the former exposition, however, is the more
   appropriate one.

   32. For their vine is of the vine of Sodom. I think it was far from the
   intention of Moses, as some make it to be, to refer to the punishment
   which the Israelites deserved; but that he rather inveighs against
   their corrupted morals, and obstinate disposition. But metaphorically
   he calls them an offshoot from the vine of Sodom and Gomorrah, inasmuch
   as they resemble in their nature both those nations, as much as if they
   had sprung from them, just as grafts of the vine produce fruits similar
   to the stocks from which they are taken. God complains by Isaiah that,
   when he looked for good and sweet grapes from His vineyard, it brought
   forth wild grapes. (Isaiah 5:2.) And also by Jeremiah that, when He had
   planted a trustworthy and genuine seed, it was turned into the branches
   of a strange vine, (Jeremiah 2:22;) but Moses goes further here, that
   the people was not merely a degenerate vine, bun poisonous, and
   producing nothing but what was deadly; and therefore he adds, not only
   that their clusters were bitter, but that their wine was the poison of
   dragons and asps; whereby he signifies that nothing worse or more
   abominable than that nation could be imagined.

   34. Is not this laid up in store with me? Although some explain this
   verse as relating to their punishments, as if God asserted that various
   kinds of them were laid up with Him, which He could produce whenever He
   pleased, it is more correct to understand it of their crimes. We are
   well aware that the ungodly, when God stays His severity, promise
   themselves impunity, as if His forbearance were a kind of connivance.
   Unless, therefore, He straightway lifts up His hand to chastise them,
   they imagine that all recollection of their crimes has vanished from
   before Him; and consequently the prophets often remind hypocrites of
   the day of visitation, in order that they may not suppose that they
   have gained anything by the delay. For this reason Jeremiah says that

   "the sin of Judah is written with an iron pen
   and with the point of a diamond," (Jeremiah 17:1.)

   Moses employs a different figure, that, although God may not appear as
   an immediate avenger, still their sins are stored up in his treasures,
   and will be brought to light by Him at the fitting season. Hence we
   gather the profitable lesson, that although God may make as though He
   saw not (dissimulet) for a time, still He does not forget the
   iniquities, the memory of which wretched men foolishly imagine to be
   blotted out, unless they are pursued by God's immediate vengeance.

   35 To me belongeth vengeance. This passage is quoted to different
   purposes by Paul, and by the author [283] of the Epistle to the
   Hebrews, (Romans 12:19; Hebrews 10:30;) for Paul, with a view of
   persuading believers to bear injuries patiently, admonishes them to
   "give place unto wrath," inasmuch as God declares vengeance to be His;
   but the author of the Epistle to the Hebrews, proclaiming that God will
   be the avenger of impiety, confirms his declaration by this testimony.
   Hence it is that part of the commentators suppose that punishment is
   here denounced against heathen nations because they have cruelly
   afflicted God's elect people. And, indeed, this appears to be the
   meaning of Paul's words, that injuries should be patiently endured,
   since God claims for Himself the office of Avenger; but there is
   nothing to prevent the same statement from being accommodated to
   different uses, and therefore Paul did not irrelevantly confirm his
   exhortation by this saying of Moses, although it literally refers to
   the internal chastisements of the Church. Besides, the apostles are not
   in the habit of quoting every word from the testimonies which they
   adduce, but briefly remind their readers to examine more closely the
   passages quoted. But, since God here joins the two things together,
   that He will punish the sins of His people, and at the same time be the
   avenger of their oppressions, there will be nothing absurd in saying
   that Paul, as it were, points his finger at this passage; [284] still,
   the simple explanation will be, that the general declaration is
   accommodated to a special case, in order that believers should bear
   their injuries patiently, and leave to God the office which He
   pronounces to appertain to Himself. In my judgment, indeed, these words
   are connected with the preceding verse; for God pertinently confirms
   His statement, that he takes account of the number of men's sins, and
   has them stored among His treasures, by adding that the power and
   office of judging rests with Himself; inasmuch as these two things are
   contrary to each other, that He should be cognizant of whatever is done
   unrighteously and amiss, and still leave it unpunished. Not that it is
   opposed to God's justice to pardon sinners when they repent, but
   because this principle always continues firm, that God is the judge of
   the world, for the punishment of all iniquities. Thus the confidence of
   hypocrites is destroyed, who flatter themselves with the hope of
   impunity, unless they are overtaken by immediate punishment.

   The clause which follows some interpreters pervert by supplying the
   relative, "in the time in which their foot shall slide;" whereas Moses
   simply concludes that they will fall in their due time, or that,
   although they may think they stand, their ruin or fall was not far off;
   and this is further confirmed by what he adds, viz., that their day of
   calamity was at hand. This statement, as I have before said, often
   occurs in the Prophets, that there is with God a fit time, [285] in
   which to punish the sins which He has appeared to overlook, and
   therefore His long-suffering detracts nothing from the judgment which
   He delays. In this doctrine there is a twofold moral; first, that those
   whom God spares for a time, should not give way to self-indulgence;
   and, secondly, that the prosperity of the wicked should not disturb the
   minds of believers, but that they should allow God to decide the time
   and the place of executing vengeance. Inasmuch, however, as God's delay
   renders hypocrites secure, so that they lull themselves to sleep in
   their vices, and, although they hear that they will have to render
   account of them, thoughtlessly indulge themselves during [286] their
   period of enjoyment, Moses declares that the day is near, and makes
   haste; for, if God does not openly alarm them, and reduce them to
   straits, they exult in their immunity. Hence those blasphemous sayings
   recorded by Isaiah, (Isaiah 5:19,) "Let him make speed, and hasten his
   work that we may see it; and let the counsel of the Holy One draw nigh
   and come, that we may know it! "Meanwhile we must bear in mind the
   words of Habakkuk, (Habakkuk 2:3,) "Though the prophecy tarry, wait for
   it; because it will surely come, it will not tarry."

   36. For the Lord shall judge his people. Some connect this sentence
   with what precedes it, and thus take the word judge for to punish, and
   the Apostle in the Epistle to the Hebrews, seems to support their
   opinion, inasmuch as he proves by this testimony how fearful a thing it
   is "to fall into the hands of the living God." (Hebrews10:30, 31.) But
   there is no reason why the Apostle should not have accommodated to a
   different purpose what was set forth by Moses for the consolation of
   the godly, in order that believers might be the more heedful, the
   nearer they saw God to show Himself as the Judge of His Church; unless
   it be perhaps preferred to construe the words of Moses thus: Although
   God should judge His people, yet at length He will be propitiated, or
   touched with repentance, so as to temper the vehemence of His anger.
   Whichever way we understand them will be of little difference in the
   main; for, after Moses has threatened the despisers of God, and the
   apostates, who desire to be accounted members of His household the
   Church, he now turns to the strangers and denounces against them that
   the cruelty which they have exercised towards the Israelites shall not
   be unpunished, because God will at length be mindful of His covenant,
   and will pardon His elect people. If you take the word judge for to
   govern, or to undertake their cause, the particle for must be rendered
   adversatively, as though it were said nevertheless or but; if we prefer
   the other sense, it will be equivalent to although, or even though.
   Doubtless the object of Moses is to encourage the hopes of the pious,
   who have profited by God's chastisement, by showing that He will
   mitigate His severity towards His elect people, and in His wrath will
   remember mercy. (Habakkuk 3:2.) Thus, then, Moses here teaches the same
   thing which God afterwards more clearly unfolded to David:

   "If thy children forsake my law,... I will visit their transgressions
   with the rod of man,... nevertheless my loving-kindness will I not take
   away from them," etc. [287] (Psalm 89:30, 33; 2 Samuel 7:14, 15.)

   For nothing is more fitted to sustain us in afflictions than when God
   promises that there shall be some limit to them, so that He will not
   utterly destroy those whom He has chosen. Whenever, therefore, the ills
   which we suffer tempt us to despair, let this lesson recur to our
   minds, that the punishments, wherewith God chastises His children, are
   temporary, since His promise will never fail that "his anger endureth
   but a moment," (Psalm 30:5,) whilst the flow of His mercy is continual.
   Hence, too, that lesson which is especially directed to the Church:
   [288]

   "For a moment I afflicted thee, but I will pursue my mercies towards
   thee for ever." (Isaiah 54:8.)

   He here calls them His servants, not because they had deserved His
   pardon by their obedience, but because He condescends to acknowledge
   them as His own; for this honor has reference to His gratuitous
   election; as when David says, "I am thy servant, and the son of thine
   handmaid," (Psalm 116:16,) he assuredly arrogates nothing peculiar to
   himself; but only boasts that he from the womb had been of God's
   family, just as slaves are born in the house of their masters. At the
   same time we must observe that, whenever God declares that He will be
   merciful to His servants, he only refers to those who heartily seek for
   reconciliation, and not to the reprobate, who are carried away to
   destruction by their desperate obstinacy. In short, to the end that God
   should repent of His severity, repentance is required on the part of
   sinners; as he teaches elsewhere:

   "Turn ye unto me,... and I will turn unto you."
   (Zechariah 1:3.)

   Instead of shall repent, some translate the word, shall console
   himself. [289] Jerome, regarding the drift of the passage rather than
   the meaning of the word, translates it shall have mercy.

   We must, however, remark the time which God prefixes for the exertion
   of His grace, viz., when all their power (virtus) shall have departed
   from them, and all shall be reduced to almost entire destruction; for
   the word hand is used for vigor; [290] as though it were said that God
   would be by no means content with a light chastisement, and
   consequently would not be appeased until they should have come to
   extremities. This circumstance is well worthy of notice, so flint our
   hopes may not fail us even in the most severe afflictions of the
   Church; but that we may be assured that although all may be in the
   worst state possible, still the due season of reparation will come even
   yet.

   That none should remain behind, or shut up or left, is almost a
   proverbial phrase in Hebrew; as when it is said, (1 Kings 14:10,) "I
   will cut off from Jeroboam,... him that is shut up and left in Israel,"
   i.e., as well in the city as in the country, or at home as abroad. And
   this is again repeated respecting the posterity of Ahab. (Ibid. 21:21.)
   And hence it is plain that they are mistaken [291] who explain this as
   referring to riches shut up in treasure-houses, and cattle dispersed
   through the fields. And this will be still more apparent from another
   passage in which the Prophet unquestionably referred to this, "The Lord
   saw the affliction of Israel, that it was very bitter; for there was
   not any shut up, nor any left," and inasmuch as He had not determined
   to blot out His people," he saved them by the hand of Jeroboam;" as
   much as to say, that God, as He had promised, had pity upon His people
   in their extreme destitution. (2 Kings 14:26, 27.)

   37. And he shall say, Where are their gods? Commentators are here at
   issue, for some continue the paragraph, as if Moses were reporting the
   boastings and insults of their enemies in the afflicted state of the
   Church; whilst others consider it to be a pious exultation, wherein the
   faithful will celebrate the deliverance of the Church. If we suppose
   the enemies to be here speaking, it will be inconsistent that the word
   "gods" should be used in the plural number: besides, what follows will
   proceed from their mistake and ignorance, that the Israelites "did eat
   the fat," which was not lawful for them even in their common food, and
   much less in the sacrifices wherein the fat was burnt. The other
   exposition, however, is that which I rather approve of, viz., that when
   the tables were turned, and God should have shown Himself as the
   avenger of the unbelievers cruel injustice, -- God's children would be
   at liberty to upbraid them. The word "he shall say," [292] is used
   indefinitely for "It shall be said by any or all of God's children."
   Just, then, as unbelievers, when they see the saints afflicted,
   impudently ridicule their faith, so on the other side Moses, when God
   comes to the help of His Church, introduces the saints derisively
   inquiring, where are the gods of the Gentiles, and where are all their
   patrons? since all of them, as is well known, had their tutelary gods.
   Thus their impure and spurious sacrifices are satirized in which they
   ate the fat, and drank the libations of wine. In short, Moses intimates
   that, when God succors His people, their mouth is opened to sing the
   song of triumph to the glory of the true God, and to upbraid
   unbelievers with the false confidence whereby they are deceived.

   39 See now that 1, even I, am he. Those who attribute the preceding
   verses to the unbelievers, now introduce God speaking, as it were,
   abruptly, and asserting His glory, in rebuke of their blasphemies. But
   it is rather a confirmation of that holy boasting which He has just
   dictated to the believers, when God not only bids His people lift up
   their voices against the idols, but Himself comes forward to condemn
   the senselessness of the Gentiles; although the context clearly shows
   that He addresses Himself to the faithful, After, therefore, He has
   exhorted His people to despise the idols, He now adds that He supplies
   them with ample grounds of confidence in Himself. For when He bids them
   "look," He signifies that no obscure manifestation of His power is
   before their eyes, if they will only pay attention to it. The
   repetition of the pronoun I is emphatic, both to arouse the people from
   their sluggishness, and to keep their minds steadfast, lest they should
   waver as if in doubt. For we know that men's minds can hardly be drawn
   to the true knowledge of God, because they wind about by circuitous
   courses, so as not to direct themselves straight to Him. And again,
   when they do apprehend God, we are aware how easily they are drawn away
   from Him; since the vicissitudes of things becloud them, so that they
   wander hither and thither in uncertainly. For this reason, when God has
   overthrown all fictitious deities, He declares that He always remains
   the same, whether he kills or makes alive, so that in the thick
   darkness of affliction believers may not cease to look to Him. Let us
   learn from this passage that God is defrauded of His right, unless He
   alone is preeminent, all idols being reduced to nothing; and also that
   our faith is then truly fixed in Him, and has firm roots, if, amidst
   the various changes which occur, it does not stagger or waver, but
   surmounts such obstacles, so as not to cease to hope in Him even when
   He seems to "slay" us, as Job says, (Job 13:15.) And surely nothing is
   more unreasonable than that our faith should look round upon all events
   so as to depend upon them; since God would have His promises to quicken
   us in death itself. The close of the verse may fitly be referred to
   their enemies, inasmuch as God declares that none can deliver them out
   of His hand.

   40. For [293] I lift up my, hand to heaven. Others render it, "When I
   shall have lifted up my hand," and read it connectedly with the
   foregoing verse, that God's power in destroying and preserving will be
   manifest, if He raises up His hand to heaven. I do not doubt, however,
   but that it is the beginning of a new sentence, and that God thus
   commences, in order to affirm more strongly what He immediately adds
   respecting the future destruction of their enemies. If, however, any
   prefer the adverb of time "when," I have no great objection to offer,
   provided these clauses are connected, "As soon as I shall have lifted
   up my hand to heaven, I will put to confusion the enemies of my
   Church."

   To lift up the hand is explained in two ways; for some suppose it to be
   a manifestation of power, as men are wont, by the uplifting of their
   hand, to glow, when they are confident in their strength, and despise
   their enemies. Others, however, more correctly state it to be a form of
   adjuration God, who is exalted above all heavens, cannot, indeed, be
   literally said to lift His hand; but it is no new thing for Him to
   borrow modes of expression taken from men's common habits and customs,
   especially when He suddenly rises again to sublimity, after having
   appeared for a while to sink below the level of His greatness.
   Certainly the words which follow contain in them an oath, "I live for
   ever;" and hence it is probable [294] that the elevation of His hand
   was expressive of His taking the oath.

   God swears by His life in a very different sense from men. Sometimes,
   indeed, He adopts our common modes of speaking, as when He is said to
   swear by His soul; but here, "I live," is tantamount to His swearing by
   Himself, or by His eternal essence.

   41 If I whet my glittering sword. The conditional particle does not
   leave the matter doubtful, or in suspense, but must be resolved into an
   adverb of time; as though He had said, As soon as He should take up
   arms, the destruction of the enemies would be certain; not indeed that
   God wants arms for the overthrow of His enemies; just as when He adds
   directly afterwards, "When my hand shall have taken hold of judgment,"
   He does not mean that it ever is taken away from Him, or escapes Him,
   but He thus designates its present and manifest operation. [295] Since,
   therefore, God, when He spares His enemies, seems, as it were, to have
   thrown aside His weapons, and to be at rest, having ceased to execute
   the office of judge, He declares that His arms shall be ready wherewith
   to destroy His enemies; and again, that then He will once more take
   upon Him the judgment which He had seemed to lay aside; in which words
   He indirectly animadverts upon the foolish security of those who
   conceive that His power is annihilated, unless He openly exerts it, and
   that the judgment which He postpones is altogether extinct.

   42 I will make my arrows drunk with blood. In these words He describes
   a horrible massacre, as though He had said, There shall be no end to my
   vengeance, until the earth shall be full of blood and corpses.
   Elsewhere [296] also, God's sword is said to be "drunk with blood," as
   here His arrows, when His wrath proceeds to inflict great acts of
   carnage; and in the same sense it is here said to "devour flesh."

   The second mdm, midam, some render, "on account of the blood;" and I
   admit that m, mem, is sometimes the causalparticle. They understand it,
   then, that this would be the just recompense of their cruelty, when the
   wicked, who had slain the Israelites, or led them away captive, should
   be cut off by God. But I do not see why the same word should be
   expounded in two different senses; and I have no doubt but that it is a
   repetition of the same thing, that God will make His "arrows drunk with
   blood;" [297] but He says, "the blood both of the slain and of the
   captives," since, when an army is put to the sword, some fall in the
   battle itself, whilst others, maimed and wounded, make an effort to
   escape.

   The conclusion of the verse is twisted into various senses; some
   expound the word "head" by change of number, "heads," as though it were
   said, "I will cut off the heads of the enemies;" it would, however, be
   more plausible to apply it metaphorically to the leaders. But others
   translate it more correctly, "the beginning," not, indeed, with
   reference to time, but as though it were said, the flower, or best of
   the multitude, according to the common phrase, "from the first to the
   last." My interpretation of "the revenges of the enemy" is, not those
   which God will inflict upon His enemies, but such as are capital, or
   deadly, as though He had said that He would deal as an enemy with the
   wicked, so that there should be no place for mercy. [298]

   43. Rejoice, O ye nations, with his people. The appositive reading,
   which some prefer, "Praise him, O nations, His people," supplying the
   word "God," is constrained. For there is no incongruity in the notion
   that the Gentiles should celebrate the benefits which God has conferred
   upon His people; at any rate, it is more simple to take it thus, that
   so conspicuous was the favor of God towards the Israelites, that the
   knowledge and favor of it should diffuse itself far and wide, and be
   renowned even among the Gentiles. For Scripture thus magnifies some of
   the more memorable exertions of God's power, especially when reference
   is made to the redemption of the elect people, and commands His praise
   to be proclaimed among the nations, since it would be by no means
   fitting that it should be confined within the narrow limits of Judea. A
   question, however, occurs, because Paul seems to quote this passage
   differently; for he says, "Rejoice, ye Gentiles, with his people,"
   (Romans 15:10;) and undoubtedly the word nqm, nakam, which Moses uses,
   also signifies to rejoice. [299] If we admit that Paul took this
   sentence from Moses, the same Spirit, who spoke both by Moses and Paul,
   is the best interpreter of His own words; nor will it be inconsistent
   that the Gentiles should rejoice at the felicity of God's people. But
   it may have been the case that Paul did not take this testimony from
   any particular place, but from the general teaching of Scripture. At
   any rate, the dignity of the people is celebrated on the ground that
   God esteems their blood precious, and will deem their persecutors His
   own adversaries.

   The word kphr, capbar, at the end of the verse, some render to expiate,
   others, to be propitious, which is the rendering I have preferred,
   although I do not reject the former meaning. The verb kphr, caphar,
   signifies that an expiation is made with sacrifice to appease God; and
   it is probable that Moses alludes to the legal mode of reconciliation;
   nevertheless, in my judgment, he means that God will restore His land
   and people to His favor.

   [265] This word ysrvn, yeshurun occurs only here, and in chap. 33:5,
   26, and Isaiah 44:2. Commentators appear to be by no means agreed as to
   its derivation or meaning, -- variously rendering it, the upright; the
   beloved; the fortunate; the abounding; the seer of God, etc. Singularly
   enough, C. himself, in his Commentary on Isaiah, (E Soc. Edit. [41]vol.
   3., p. 359,) gives the following contradictory opinion: "This
   designation is also bestowed upon that nation by Moses in his song: for
   although some render it in that passage Upright, and in this passage
   also, the old rendering is more suitable, "My beloved is grown fat."
   (Deuteronomy 32:15.)

   [266] A. V., "newly." Lat., e propinquo."

   [267] In the editions of Geneva, 1563 and 1573, C. is made to say, that
   this word is equivalent to "formare, vel pavere;" the former being
   probably a misprint for reformidare. -- W. The Fr. renders the words
   "Redouter, ou avoir peur."

   [270] It will be seen that C. translates both the verbs in this verse,
   'sphh aspheh, and 'klh, acalleh, by the same word, consumam; whilst A.
   V. renders the first I will heap, and the latter, I will spend; in
   accordance with the view of Ainsworth, Mareldus, and Dathe.

   [271] Professor Liebig has pointed out the dreadful fact, in singular
   confirmation of the expression here employed by Moses, that "when a
   person is starved to death, he is, in fact, slowly burnt, as, during
   the process of starvation, a slow combustion of the body takes place."

   [272] Un accessoire pire que toutes los morts du monde, quand nous

   and translated in A. V. provocations; margin, "Heb. angers."

   [274] See Margin, A.V.

   [275] The references in the original to both these passages are
   obviously incorrect; it is probable, however, that Marckius in loco
   supplies them aright, viz., Isaiah 10:12, 13, etc. and Habakkuk 1:16,
   17.

   [279] "Shut them up." -- A. V.

   [280] The reference is here generally to Isaiah 52:3, however, to which
   C. probably alludes, hardly bears out the statement in the text: "Ye
   have sold yourselves for nought, etc. The Fr. stands thus, "Isaie, en
   parlant du retour de la captivite de Babylone, dit que Dieu rachetera
   le peuple qu'il a vendu."

   this they have not from their own gods, but from our God, who has
   delivered us into their hands."

   [283] It is notorious that C. adopted the opinion of the Western Church
   in the third and fourth centuries, and did not admit St. Paul to be the
   author of the Epistle to the Hebrews: see the [43]Argument to his
   Commentary, (C., Soc. Edit.,) p. 27. This discrepancy is noticed, ibid,

   not to indulge themselves, according to the diabolical proverb, that
   the delay is worth the money. -- Fr.

   [287] C. evidently quoted from memory, and amalgamated the two
   citations.

   [288] Here also the substance, and not the words of the passage, are
   given.

   [289] LXX Paraklethesetai V. "miserebitur." Addition in Fr., "Le mot de

   [291] This notion is attributed in Poole to "many of the Hebrews, and
   Malvenda."

   [292] This sentence is omitted in the Fr., but implied in the
   translation, "On dira."

   [293] Lat., certe; Fr., car; V., cum.

   [294] I hardly understand the hypothetical form in which this sentence
   is put, after what C. has already said on this point on Exodus 6:8
   ([46]vol. 1, p. 131,) and on Numbers 14:30 (ante, [47]p. 81.) Perhaps
   he merely meant that the coincidence of the adjuration with the
   uplifting of the hand fixed the sense of the latter expression in this
   place.

   [295] "C'est pour signifier un effet present et manifest, lequel
   n'estoit point apparu devant;" it is to signify a present and manifest
   effect, which had appeared before. -- Fr.

   [296] Jeremiah 46:10.

   enemy." S.M.,"From the head of revenges of the enemy." V. and Luther,"
   Of the bare head of the enemies.' LXX., "From the head of the chief
   enemies." The word r's is either the head of a body, or the beginning
   of an event. phrvt comes from a verb signifying to deal out
   retribution, and has therefore been taken by some to mean revenge, and
   by others to mean chiefs or rulers, whose office it is to avenge
   wrongs; there are, however, instances in which phr is acknowledged to
   be the hair of the head. -- W.

   Deuteronomy 32:44. And Moses came and spake. It is not without reason
   that Moses again records that he repeated this Song before the people;
   because it thence appears how far from all ambition he was, in that he
   did not fear, at the very close of his life, to irritate all their
   minds, so as to render the memory of his name hateful; and besides, his
   authority was sanctioned by the silence and submissiveness of the
   people, when they suffered themselves to be thus severely dealt with.
   For, such was their general refractoriness, that they never would have
   listened to him, had not the secret inspiration of the Spirit
   interposed to subdue them.

   He associates with himself Joshua, whom he undoubtedly desired to

   to obtain reverence for the law. For we often see that bare doctrine is
   cold and nerveless, unless the sluggishness, which as it were stifles
   men's minds, is sharply stimulated; lest, then, the teaching of the Law
   should be despised or forgotten, or, from being but languidly received,
   should gradually be obliterated from their minds, he as it were spurs
   them up by the vehemence of this Song, and commands that their
   posterity should be instructed in it, in order that their attention may
   be aroused by its menaces. In the next verse (47) he recommends to them
   zeal in the observance of the Law on the score of its profitableness;
   for translators render it improperly, as it seems to me, "Lest it
   should be an empty word to you," or, "It is not an empty word, such as
   you should despise." Jerome's translation is better -- "The precepts
   are not given you in vain;" for Moses simply intimates that the Law was
   not given in vain, so as to end in fruitlessness; and consequently they
   were to beware lest they should frustrate God's purpose, who desired to
   do them good. rq, rek, therefore, is used as the converse of
   "fruitful," as more clearly appears from the confirmation immediately
   added, that they "might prolong their days in the promised land." The
   Law, then, is said not to be vain, because it is fruitful unto
   salvation. In what way it is also deadly, and has no inherent efficacy,
   I have already shown. [300] It is indeed true that the Law, as being
   the sure rule of righteousness, does not deceptively promise salvation
   to men; but, since there is no one who actually performs what God
   requires, through the accidental guilt of men, life is turned into
   death; but, when all are plunged beneath the curse, a new remedy
   supervenes, and by God's gratuitous pardon they are so reconciled to
   Him, as that their obedience, such as it is, becomes acceptable.

   48. And the Lord spake unto Moses. We infer that this is not recorded
   in its regular order, because it is certain that Moses was warned of
   his approaching death before the Song was composed; and this the second
   passage, which I have here appended, expressly confirms; for he says
   that, before he substituted Joshua for himself, the place was pointed
   out to him in which he was to die. It is, however, by no means unusual
   for the order of narration to be inverted.

   We may here perceive a singular specimen of faith and obedience. All
   naturally fly from death, so that no one hastens towards it of his own
   accord. He would never, therefore, have voluntarily entered the tomb,
   unless relying on the hope of a better life. We have already seen a
   similar instance in the case of Aaron: although the resurrection was
   not then so clearly revealed as it now is by the Gospel, nor had Christ
   appeared, who is the first-fruits of them that rise again. Wherefore,
   though our carnal sense may be averse from death, let our faith prevail
   to overcome all its terrors: even as Paul teaches that God's children,
   although they desire not "to be unclothed," still long to be "clothed
   upon, that mortality may be swallowed up of life." (2 Corinthians 5:4.)
   This, however, was remarkable obedience, to prepare himself no less
   willingly for death than as if he had been invited to some joyful
   banquet. Thus it is plain that these holy men had so consecrated
   themselves to God, that they were ready to live or to die, according to
   His pleasure.

   Mount Abarim seems to have obtained its name from its angles or sides,
   because it was divided [301] into many hills; as it is called also Nebo
   in this place, and elsewhere by divers other names. Others think it is
   named from a passage; but the other opinion is more probable, since it
   is called in the plural number Abarim, that is, heights, or summits, or
   interstices, which were situated on opposite heights.

   Although we shall presently see that there was another reason why God
   desired to withdraw His servant from the sight of men, still we must
   take notice of the consolation, which is here referred to, that the
   pain of his death was alleviated by the permission to behold the land
   of Canaan. For this reason he is commanded to get up into the top of
   the mountain; for, although he would have been satisfied with the mere
   promise of God, even had he been deprived of this blessing, still it
   had no slight additional effect in enabling him more cheerfully to
   leave the people on the threshold of their inheritance. For faith does
   not altogether deprive God's children of human feelings; but our
   heavenly Father in His indulgence has compassion on their infirmity.
   Thus, as it was a cause of sorrow to Moses to be withheld from entering
   the land, he was supported by a seasonable remedy, that he might not be
   hindered in his course by this impediment.

   51. Because ye trespassed against me. We perceive from his punishment
   how necessary to Moses was such a token of favor. [302] For death in
   itself would not have been so bitter, but the cause, which is again
   alleged, grievously wounded the mind of the holy man, in that he saw
   himself to be excluded in God's just vengeance from the common
   inheritance on account of his own guilt, which is more afflictive to
   the pious than a hundred, nay, innumerable deaths. Hence those mournful
   complaints of David and Hezekiah, and others elsewhere, when their life
   is taken from them by all angry God:

   "the grave cannot praise thee, death cannot celebrate thee: they that
   go down into the pit cannot hope for thy truth." (Isaiah 38:18; Psalm
   6:5; Psalm 115:17.)

   Surely it was not so formidable a thing for them to die, but that they
   would have calmly and cheerfully departed from the world when their
   time came; but what they deprecated was the awful judgment of God, at
   the thoughts of which they were alarmed. The same grief might have
   overwhelmed the mind of Moses, had it not been alleviated.

   But since none, however eminent, have been altogether exempt from
   temporal punishments, let us learn to bear them patiently. God did not
   spare Moses; what wonder if our condition is no better than his?
   Moreover, in the opinion of men it was a trifling offense, for the sake
   of which he was so severely chastised; for, carried away by
   indignation, he had been so irritated against the people that he had
   attributed less power to God that was due to Him. Now, those errors,
   into which we fall through thoughtless impetuosity, are more easily
   pardoned; but hence it is manifest; how precious to God is His glory,
   when He does not suffer it to be obscured with impunity even by
   inadvertence. At the same time, also, we are taught that nothing is
   more irrational than to assume to ourselves the judgment respecting
   sins, and to weigh them in our own balance, when God is their only
   legitimate assessor.

   But, although He declares that Moses and Aaron revolted, and were
   rebellious "to His mouth," [303] still, lest it should be thought that
   they studiously refused credence to God's word, a kind of qualification
   is added, viz., that they did not sanctify God in the midst, or before
   the eyes, of the children of Israel. Hence it. is plain that they were
   only condemned for the excessive violence of their passion, whereby
   they did not uphold God's glory before the people with sufficient
   energy.

   As to the rest, it may be looked for under Numbers 20.

   the Lord, the shield of thy help, and who is the sword of thy
   excellency! and thine enemies shall be found liars unto thee; and thou
   shalt tread upon their high places.

   29. Beatus es o Israel, quis similis tibi popule qui servaris in Jehova
   scuto auxilii tui, et gladio excellentiae tuae? humiliabuntur inimici
   tui, et tu super excelsa eorum calcabis.


   1. And this is the blessing. The bitterness of the Song was seasoned,
   [304] as it were, by this palliative, wherein Moses left a testimony
   with respect to God's future and perpetual grace, as if depositing an
   inestimable treasure in the hands of the people. For, as God, after the
   deliverance of His people, and the giving of the Law, renewed the
   covenant which Jacob had testified of and proclaimed, so Moses was, as
   it were, their second father, to ratify anew its blessings, lest the
   memory of them should ever be lost.

   In order to beget confidence in his benedictions, he commences by
   magnifying his vocation before he proceeds to them; for, although the
   word benediction is equivalent to a prayer for success, yet must it be
   borne in mind that Moses does not here pray in the ordinary manner,
   like a private person, in such a way as fathers are wont to offer
   supplications for their children; but that, in the spirit of prophecy,
   he sets forth the blessings which were to be expected from God. This,
   then, is the reason why he extols the dignity and glory of his office
   as ruler in such lofty terms, viz., that the twelve tribes of Israel
   may be thoroughly assured that God is the author of these blessings.
   For the same reason he calls himself "the man of God:" that the people
   may receive what he is about to say as if it. proceeded from God, whose
   undoubted minister he is. Nor is the circumstance of time without its
   weight -- "before his death," or, "in his death," which adds to the
   prophecy the force of a testament.

   2 And he said, The Lord came from, Sinai. [305] In these words he
   reminds them that he is setting before them, a confirmation of the
   covenant, which God had made with them in this Law, and that it is
   nothing different from it; for this connection was of exceeding
   efficacy in establishing the certainty of the blessings, provided only
   the Law was duly honored; for nothing was better adapted to confirm the
   grace of God than the majesty which was displayed in the promulgation
   of the Law. Some, as I conceive improperly, translate it, -- "God comes
   to Sinai," whereas Moses rather means that he came from thence, when
   His brightness was made manifest. By way of ornament, the same thing is
   repeated with respect to Seir and Paran; and, since these three words
   are synonymous, therefore to go forth, to rise up, and to come, also
   represent the same thing, viz., that manifestation of the divine glory
   which should have ravished into admiration the minds of all; as though
   he had said that his blessings were to be received with the same
   reverence, as that which God had procured for His Law, when His face
   was conspicuously displayed on Mount Sinai. The Prophet Habakkuk
   (Habakkuk 3:3) has imitated this figure, though with a different
   object, viz., that, the people might confidently rely upon his power,
   which had formerly been manifested to the fathers in visible
   brightness.

   By "ten thousands of sanctity," [306] I do not understand, as many do,
   the faithful, but the angels, by whom God was accompanied as by a royal
   retinue; for God also commanded the ark to be placed between the
   Cherubim, in order to show that the heavenly hosts were around Him. So
   in Isaiah, (Isaiah 6:6,) the Seraphim surround His throne; and Daniel
   says that he saw "ten thousand times ten thousand," (Daniel 7:10;) thus
   designating an infinite multitude, as does Moses also by "ten
   thousand." It is probable that both Paul and Stephen derived from this
   passage their statement that the Law was "ordained by Angels in the
   hand of a mediator," (Galatians 3:19; Acts 7:53;) for its authority was
   greatly confirmed by its having so many witnesses (obsignatores.)

   The Law is placed at His right hand, not only as a scepter or mark of
   dignity, but as His power or rule of government; for He did not merely
   show Himself as a king, but also made known how He would preside over
   them. [307] The Law is called fiery, in order to inspire terror and to
   enforce humility upon them all; although I am not adverse to the
   opinion that Moses alludes in this epithet to the outward signs of fire
   and flame, of which he spoke in Exodus 20. But, since the word dt,
   dath, means any statute or edict, some restrict it to the prohibition
   that none should more closely approach the mountain. In my own mind,
   however, there is no doubt but that it designates all the doctrine
   whereby God's dominion is maintained.

   3. Yea, he loved the people. [308] If it be preferred to apply this to
   the Gentiles, the sentence must be thus resolved, "Although He loves
   all human beings, still His saints are honored with His peculiar favor,
   in that He watches over their safety;" but it is more correct to
   expound it as referring only to the children of Abraham, whom He calls
   "peoples," because, on account of the multitude into which they had
   grown, in their several tribes, they might be reckoned as so many
   nations. And since the particle 'ph, aph, [309] signifies prolongation
   of time, like adhuc in Latin, the following sense will be very
   satisfactory, that, Although the descendants of Abraham were divided
   into various races, and might therefore seem to be no longer a single
   family, nevertheless God still continued to regard them all with
   affection, and their numbers and divisions did not prevent Him from
   accounting them to be a single body. The sum is, that God's favor
   towards them was not extinguished, either by the progress of time, or
   the increase of the people; but that it was constantly extended to the
   race of Abraham, however far or widely it might be spread.

   It must, however, be observed, that in proof of His love, it is
   presently added, that they were in the hand of God. Hence we infer
   that, from the time that God has embraced us with His favor, He is the
   sure guardian of our safety; whence also arises the firm assurance of
   eternal life. The change of person, from the third to the second,
   throws no obscurity on the meaning. Since many hypocrites were mixed up
   with the faithful -- for the Church of God has always been like a
   threshing-floor [310] -- Moses restricts this special grace of God to
   those who willingly submit themselves to Him, and with pious
   teachableness embrace this instruction, by which sign he distinguishes
   between the true children of God, and those spurious or degenerate
   ones, who falsely assume the name. Where my translation is, "They
   cleaved to thy feet," others render the words, "They were struck at thy
   feet," but in my judgment constrainedly. Others extract from it a
   useful piece of instruction, that "they were subdued by God's
   chastisements, so as to render Him obedience;" but the metaphor is
   rather taken from disciples, who, according to the common usage of the
   Hebrew language, are said to sit at their master's feet, in order to
   attend more diligently. And this is confirmed by the context, for the
   faithful are said to have attached themselves to God's feet, that they
   might receive of this words, i.e., profit by His instruction.

   4 Moses commanded us a law. What he had declared respecting the glory
   of God, and the excellency of the Law, he now applies to his own
   person, since it was his purpose, as I have said, to establish the
   authority of his own ministry. In order, therefore, to prove the
   certainty of his mission, he boasts that he was appointed by God to be
   the teacher of the people, and that not for a brief period, but
   throughout all ages; for by the word "inheritance," the perpetuity of
   the Law is signified. He then claims for himself the royal supremacy,
   not because he had ruled after the manner of kings, but that the
   dignity of this high office might add weight to his words. He says that
   "the heads of the people and the tribes were gathered together," with
   reference to their unhappy disorganization, which was tending to their
   destruction, as much as to say that, under his guidance, rind by his
   exertions, the state of the people was reestablished.

   He begins with Reuben, the first-born, and so far removes or mitigates
   the ignominy of that condemnation wherewith he had been branded by his
   father Jacob, as only to stop short of restoring him to his place of
   honor. For the holy Patriarch had pronounced a severe sentence, namely,
   that Reuben should be "as unstable as water, and should not excel."
   (Genesis 49:4.) Lest, therefore, the whole of his posterity should be
   discouraged, or should be rejected by the other tribes, he abates the
   severity of his disinheritance, as if to pardon the condemned. In
   short, he assigns to the family of Reuben a place among the sons of
   Jacob, lest despair should drive them to headlong ruin. The second
   clause admits of two contrary meanings. Literally it is, "Let him be
   small in number;" and, in fact, this tribe was not of the more numerous
   ones. Since, however, it occupied a middle place, and surpassed several
   of the others, some repeat the negative, "Let him not die, nor let him
   be few in number." [311] But it appears more probable that an abatement
   is made from the rank to which his primogeniture entitled the family of
   Reuben, and thus that some remainder of dishonor was introduced into
   the promise of grace. And, in fact, not only the tribe of Judah, but
   those of Simeon, Issachar, Zebulun, Dan, and Naphthali, surpassed it in
   size. Thus the qualification will be by no means inappropriate, that,
   although Reuben was to be reckoned among the people of God, still he
   should not altogether recover his dignity.

   7. And this is the blessing of Judah. [312] Jerome has faithfully given
   the sense, "This is the blessing," although it is not actually
   expressed.

   It might at first sight appear inconsistent that some abatement should
   be made from the splendid and abundant blessings which had been
   promised to the tribe of Judah. This, however, is by no means the case;
   for the inviolable decree respecting the supremacy of Judah is not thus
   altered; but Moses merely reminds them how difficult of accomplishment
   it would be. Jacob had declared, as if speaking of a peaceful dominion,
   that his "brethren should praise" him, that his "father's children
   should bow down before" him; that "the scepter should not depart from
   Judah, nor a lawgiver from between his feet," (Genesis 49:8, 10;) but,
   inasmuch as this dignity lay dormant for a long time, and it was
   necessary that it should contend with many tedious obstacles before it
   finally manifested itself, Moses consequently speaks in more limited
   terms. Still, he seems to have referred not merely to the earlier
   period, but to the various calamities whereby the kingdom of David was
   not only apparently diminished, but destroyed; and especially to the
   melancholy interruption of it which arose from the Babylonish
   captivity. The sum is, that the prosperity of which Jacob prophesied
   was not to be so conspicuous in the tribe of Judah, as that all things
   were to be expected to be joyous and successful, but rather that those,
   to whom the supreme power as well as wealth was promised, would be
   exposed to many evils, so that they should be reduced to extremities,
   and be greatly in want of the help of God. He therefore betakes himself
   to prayer, and by his example admonishes not that tribe only, but the
   others also, to implore the faithfulness of God in their overwhelming
   difficulties. And this lesson applies to ourselves also, in order that
   we may be the more aroused to prayer and supplication, the more Satan
   is urgent for the destruction of Christ's kingdom. At the same time,
   what I have stated must be observed, namely, that the promise remains
   firm, since it is not in vain that Moses places all the tribes under
   the dominion of Judah, when he petitions that he may be brought unto
   his people, nor promises in vain that God will be at hand to help him,
   so that he may prevail against his enemies.

   8 And of Levi he said. This qualification, or modification of the
   harsher sentence of Jacob was introduced not only for the sake of the
   tribe of Levi, but rather of the whole people. Jacob had said,

   "Simeon and Levi are brethren: instruments of cruelty are in their
   habitations. O my soul, come not thou into their secret; unto their
   assembly, my tongue, [313] be not thou united,"
   (Genesis 49:5, 6.)

   Assuredly their descendants might have been discouraged, or at least
   might have been regarded contemptuously, when a patriarch, and the
   founder of their race, had thus abominated them. God, however,
   afterwards consecrated this tribe to Himself, so that their sanctity
   might be communicated to the other tribes; which could not be the case
   unless their previous opprobrium were removed.

   But if any contentious person had objected to this blessing, as if
   Moses were too much disposed to favor his own tribe, such a suspicion
   could not justly be harbored against him; first, because he, who now
   makes such honorable mention of the tribe of Levi, was also the
   proclaimer of their ignominy; and on many other occasions had not
   spared his own family, but, whenever it was requisite, had freely
   inveighed against their vices; and, secondly, he now commends nothing
   in the Levites except the new dignity, which it had pleased God to
   confer upon them. On this point, indeed, he ought to have been least of
   all suspected, inasmuch as he had degraded his own sons, and had
   exalted the posterity of Aaron alone to the highest place of honor.
   Now, therefore, he has no other object but that the dignity of the
   priesthood should not be depreciated on account of the sins of men, and
   thus their religion itself be despised. For we all know how disposed
   people are to lay charges against the persons of men which may derogate
   from the sacredness of their office. Assuredly, if Levi had not been
   purged from that disgrace which he had incurred, the priesthood would
   have been altogether deprived of reverence; and thus God's worship
   would have been very lightly esteemed. Now, however, when God
   sanctifies this family to himself, he, as it were, restores it
   entirely; and hence it is apparent that its punishment was only
   temporary, since Moses had no intention of retracting what the Spirit
   had dictated to holy Jacob. Nor does he, indeed, advance anything of
   himself; but the same Spirit removes the ignominy, which might have
   disgraced the tribe of Levi, inasmuch as it had only been imposed upon
   it for a time. We have already seen elsewhere that what Jacob
   prophesied respecting the dispersion of this family, resulted in its
   honor; since God posted the Levites in all directions like sentinels,
   that through their means purity of doctrine might be fostered amongst
   the whole people. They were, therefore, scattered in such a manner as
   that their punishment might be productive of benefit. We must,
   therefore, conclude, that Moses spoke not to gratify his brethren, but
   made honorable mention of the priesthood, lest those, whom God had
   chosen as this ministers, should be treated with contempt. And,
   doubtless, the subsequent grace of their calling should have blotted
   out the recollection of their previous infamy. Thus Christ, when He
   would restore Peter to the office of an apostle, cancels his triple
   denial, by thrice setting him over His sheep. (John 21:17.)

   The address, which follows, must be applied to God; for some translate
   it improperly, "The Urim and Thummim shall be with thee," as if Moses
   were addressing the tribe of Levi. In order, therefore, to avoid
   ambiguity, it will be well to translate it of Levi, rather than to
   Levi; and l, lamed, is often used in this sense. Thus, with the purpose
   of increasing the authenticity of the benediction, Moses addresses God
   Himself, as if citing Him as a witness, or referring his injunctions to
   God's tribunal.

   Although in Hebrew the words Urim and Thummim [314] are here used,
   which were principal parts of the sacred Ephod, I have not hesitated to
   translate them as common nouns: for it is unquestionable that by these
   symbols were denoted, the knowledge of the Law which is the only light
   of our souls, and integrity of life. The sum, however, is that the
   honor of the priesthood was deposited with Aaron, whom he calls the man
   of God's clemency, or, the meek. Jerome, as usual, renders it the holy,
   but improperly; for [315] chsyd, chasid, signifies mild, or humane; and
   this epithet is constantly applied to the children of God, in order
   that we may learn to imitate that Father of mercy, who "maketh his sun
   to rise upon the evil and the good."

   What follows, viz., that God tried him at Massah, I conceive to be
   added by way of exception; for I have no doubt but that Moses magnifies
   God's mercy by this allusion, in that He had dignified Aaron with so
   great an honor, notwithstanding his having been overcome by impatience,
   and having fallen. Still it must be remarked that, in reference to the
   people, the zeal of Aaron is recorded as praiseworthy; as much as to
   say, that the sin of Aaron flowed from the fountain of virtue, since it
   was from holy indignation that he fell into the passion of impatience,
   when he could not endure that the people should rebel against God.
   Unless perhaps it be preferred to understand these words by way of
   apostrophe to the people, "Thou didst try, thou didst provoke him to
   contention, or didst quarrel with him." But the context will run
   better, if we understand that God then had a controversy with Aaron;
   inasmuch as, although overcome by the trial, he still gave no
   despicable proof of his piety, and from that time forward did not cease
   to execute his office with sedulity.

   9. Who said unto his father and his mother. In the person of Aaron an
   example is set before all the Levites for their imitation. And, first,
   he is said to have renounced his own flesh and blood, in order that he
   might be more disencumbered for obeying God; and in fact it is
   necessary that all the pastors of the Church should put off their
   earthly affections, which would otherwise often keep them back from
   devoting themselves entirely to God. Aaron, then, is said to have bid
   farewell to all his family, that he might be at liberty to lay himself
   out for God. Christ now requires the same thing of His disciples, that
   sons should forget their fathers, and fathers their sons, and husbands
   their wives, lest anything should retard their course, and prevent them
   from earnestly advancing through life and death to the end to which
   they are called. (Matthew 10:37.)

   Moses afterwards, by using the plural number, embraces the whole
   Levitical order; and hence we may infer that what had preceded is not
   to be confined in its application to a single individual. But when he
   says that they "guarded (custodisse) the word of God, and kept his
   covenant," he does not refer to mere ordinary obedience, but to the
   peculiar care of preserving that which was intrusted to their charge.
   It is true that in like manner all believers are said to keep the Law,
   when they zealously devote themselves to live a holy life; but special
   allusion is here made to the office of teaching. The Levites,
   therefore, are called guardians of the Law, and keepers of it, as being
   phulakes, since with them was deposited the treasure of Divine
   instruction, as is more clearly set forth in the next verse, "They
   shall teach Jacob, etc." If any should prefer that this observing of
   the Law should be understood of their life and habits, as though it
   were said, that the Levites should surpass others in the examples they
   gave, I do not contend the point, though it seems to me that the second
   clause is explanatory, and that it more familiarly sets forth what was
   spoken with some little obscurity, pointing out the way in which the
   Law is to be observed, viz., by their being the teachers and masters of
   the people. We must, however, remark the method they are to adopt in
   teaching; for they are not permitted to introduce their own inventions,
   or to frame a rule of life out of their own heads; but they are
   commanded to seek in the Law itself what they are to teach, and to
   interpret it honestly and faithfully. And this condition was inserted
   in order that whosoever should desire to be successors in the honor
   should be mindful of their vocation, and faithfully devote themselves
   to the office of teaching. Thus, when in a corrupt state of the Church,
   priests, who had nothing of this sort about them, paraded their mere
   empty title; their silly vaunt is refuted by Malachi:

   "My covenant (he says) was with Levi of life and peace;.... for the law
   of truth was in his mouth, and the priest's lips should keep knowledge,
   and they should seek the law at his mouth, but ye have corrupted my
   covenant," (Malachi 2:5, 6, 7, 8.)

   Let us learn, then, from this passage, that whosoever claims for
   himself the primacy in the Church must be repudiated, unless he
   manifests himself to be a faithful teacher.

   The third part of the priest's office follows, viz., that he should
   apply himself to the performance of the religious services; for God had
   disencumbered them from the labors of agriculture and other earthly
   business, that they might be more entirely at liberty for the duties of
   teaching and sacrifice; and, although this latter might appear to be
   but an humble occupation, still, if we regard it aright, it was no
   common honor that they should be mediators and intercessors for the
   reconciliation of the people to God; for even the very least of the
   Levites had something to do with making atonement.

   Under the words "incense and whole burnt-sacrifice," the entire legal
   service is comprehended; and the incense is said to be put before the
   nose of God; [316] because the odor of this offering was grateful, and,
   as it were, sweet-smelling to Him, as we have elsewhere seen.

   11. Bless, Lord, his substance. This supplication appears to have been
   intended tacitly to provide against the poverty which awaited the
   Levites, if God had not supplied them with food from some other source
   besides the produce of the soil; for they were deprived of a share in
   the general inheritance, and God alone was their property. Lest,
   therefore, their condition should be painful to them, Moses offers them
   consolation, and bids them expect from God abundance for their support,
   whilst he promises that His blessing shall stand them in stead of the
   most redundant produce; as it is said in Psalm 132:15, "I will
   abundantly bless her provision, and satisfy her priests [317] with
   bread."

   What follows, that "the work of his hands may be acceptable to God,"
   may be either explained generally of the labor which is bestowed for
   the purpose of obtaining food, or of the service and ministry of the
   tabernacle; but, inasmuch as God engaged the Levites in sacred
   occupations, it seems indirectly to promise them that such exercises
   would be no less profitable to them than as if they were altogether
   occupied in the pursuit of gain. It was allowable for the rest to
   employ their industry for the advancement of their domestic interests,
   whilst the Levites, in order properly to perform their duties, were
   obliged to neglect their private affairs. Lest, then, they should be
   afraid of destitution, Moses reminds them that they might expect from
   God an earthly reward also for their spiritual labors.

   The third point appears to be purposely introduced, that "God would
   smite through or transfix their enemies," because pious teachers are
   very much exposed to envy, and ill-will, and persecution; for the
   complaint which is made by Jeremiah, (Jeremiah 15:10,) that he was "a
   man of strife," is applicable to all the prophets and ministers of God;
   since the world can hardly bear its affections to be slain by the
   spiritual sword of God's word, and hence many contentions arise.
   Besides, Satan, in order to render their: doctrine contemptible, does
   not cease to harass them by whatever means he can, and to arm his bands
   to war against them; so that the pastors of the Church have need of
   God's special aid. This point, then, is peculiarly worthy of
   observation that, although many adversaries always threaten God's
   servants, besiege them, provoke them to conflict, in a word, are always
   plotting their destruction, still God's succor will be at hand, whereby
   they may be rendered invincible; as it was said to Jeremiah,

   "They shall fight against thee,
   but they shall not prevail against thee." (Jeremiah 1:19.)

   The words I have translated "lest they rise again," others render "lest
   they rise against them;" and, although I do not reject this, still it
   seems to be less appropriate; for Moses did not wish to exempt the
   Levites from the annoyances of combat, but only to promise them
   victory, inasmuch as God would overwhelm and destroy their enemies.
   [318]

   12. And of Benjamin he said. It is probable that Moses alludes to the
   inheritance which fell to the lot of the children of Benjamin; for the
   part of Jerusalem in which the temple stood was contained in it. Since,
   therefore, God assigned them a dwelling-place, in which He in a manner
   protected them, and cherished them beneath His wings, they are not
   without reason called His beloved, for this was no ordinary pledge of
   His love To "dwell upon God," [319] and "between his shoulders," is
   equivalent to reposing upon Him; a similitude taken from fathers who
   carry their children whilst yet they are small and tender. Others
   extract a different meaning, viz., that God would dwell upon the
   shoulders of Benjamin; but this is very unnatural. [320]

   13. And of Joseph he said. Moses repeats some portions of the blessing
   of Jacob; nor with respect to any other tribe does he approach so
   closely to the words of the Patriarch. And, although the family of
   Joseph was already divided into two tribes or nations, still he begins
   by the head itself, and at the conclusion declares that what had been
   given to their fathers pertains to Ephraim and Manasseh. First, he
   celebrates the exceeding fertility of the land, in which the
   descendants of Joseph were to dwell; and then ratifies his testimony by
   the authority of God. He promises them, then, that their land shall be
   fertile, from the best treasures of heaven; for mgd, meged, signifies
   whatever is best and most precious. I do not, therefore, approve of
   their translation, who render it fruits, although I know not whether
   Moses speaks of the excellency of the climate, or commends the
   beneficence of God; the latter, however, accords best with the context,
   in which he makes mention of the external means of fertility, viz., the
   dew, and the deep, by which word I understand the depth of the soil
   itself. In the next verse I admit that by the word mgd, meged, the
   choicest fruits are indicated, but without any change of its meaning.
   Others render it delicacies: others sweet fruits, on account of the
   peculiar excellency of the fruits. But I do not see why some translate
   the word grs, geresh, "influence." It literally means thrusting out;
   and is used metaphorically for the fruit, which arises and breaks forth
   from the earth. But it is not very clear to me what fruits he speaks of
   respectively as "of the sun, and the moon;" for I cannot tell whether
   there are any grounds for assigning, as some do, to the sun the produce
   which springs from seed and the vintage; and to the moon, cucumbers and
   gourds; nor do I attempt to decide whether their idea is more correct
   who suppose the latter to be flowers or fruits which appear every
   month.

   15. And for the chief things of the ancient mountains. In these words
   he shows that no part of the land would be barren. We know that the
   tops of mountains are generally and uncultivated, or at any rate bear
   nothing but trees that have no fruit. But Moses affirms that even there
   also there shall be the richest produce, for which reason, at least in
   my opinion, he calls the mountains ancient, and the hills lasting, as
   if being very highly renowned; for their antiquity is not praised, as
   if they were created before the rest of the world, but these mountains
   are honorably distinguished as the first-born, because God's blessing
   eminently rests upon them. Thus in the blessing of Jacob it is said,
   "unto the utmost bound of the everlasting hills," as much as to say,
   that no corner of these most celebrated mountains should be devoid of
   fertility. (Genesis 49:26.)

   In the next verse he extends generally to the whole land what he had
   said of the mountains.

   Those are wide of the meaning of Moses, who translate what follows: "On
   account of the good-will of the dweller in the bush the blessing shall
   come;" and his rendering is altogether barbarous who gives it, "On
   account of the piety," etc. My opinion is that the word rtsvn, retzon,
   is in the nominative case; for it is quite in accordance with the
   context that the "favor of God would come upon the head of Joseph;"
   for, after Moses had magnified His bounty, he now points out its source
   or cause, viz., that this extraordinary fertility was the result of
   God's gratuitous favor. The words of Jacob, "by the God of thy father,"
   and "by the Almighty," exactly correspond with these; where also I have
   explained why Joseph was called a Nazarene among his brethren. [321]

   God is called "the dweller in the bush" by periphrasis, with reference
   to the vision which was presented to Moses on Mount Sinai; for God then
   appeared a second time as the Redeemer and Father of His people; after
   having made His covenant with Abraham and Jacob. And this serves by way
   of confirmation; as if it were said, that the same God who had formerly
   blessed Joseph by the mouth of His servant Jacob, now repeated the same
   prophecy, in order to give fuller assurance of its truth.

   17 His glory is like the firstling. Translators obscure the meaning by
   translating the word firstling in the nominative case. I have no doubt,
   however, but that he compares the glory of Joseph to the size of a very
   fine bullock, as if He had said, "His beauty is as of the most choice
   bullocks in his herds." At least it is very consistent that the word
   firstling should be used for pre-eminent. He says, then, that no more
   magnificent or glorious bullocks should be found in the land of Joseph
   than the people itself would be. And to beauty he adds strength and
   vigor, so that they should be victorious over all their enemies.

   At the end of the verse (as I have before stated,) he declares that
   what he had prophesied of Joseph should be common to the two families
   of Ephraim and Manasseh. At the same time he confirms the declaration
   of Jacob, whereby he had preferred Ephraim the younger to the elder.
   Manasseh, therefore, only reckons his thousands, but Ephraim his tell
   thousands, a proof of which fact God had given in the census which has
   been already recorded, in which the tribe of Ephraim was found to be
   the more numerous.

   18. And of Zebulun he said. He compares two tribes with each other,
   which, although neighbors in position, were still very dissimilar; for
   the one being devoted to mercantile pursuits, went forth frequently in
   various directions; the other took more delight in quietude and repose;
   and this their great variety of condition is indicated, when he bids
   Zebulun rejoice in its expeditions, and Issachar in its domestic
   repose. Moses thus confirms the prophecy of Jacob, who said that
   Zebulun should "dwell at the haven of the sea," so as to make voyages
   of traffic; whilst Issachar, as delighting more in repose, should be
   lazy and idle, so as to make no objections against paying tribute, in
   order to purchase peace. (Genesis 49:13-15.)

   What follows I suppose to be added, as though Moses had said that their
   distant location should not prevent them from going up with the others
   to Jerusalem, for the purpose of performing their religious duties. For
   in that they were farther removed from the temple, their zeal in the
   legal service might have grown cold. Although, then, they dwelt in the
   utmost borders of the land, Moses says that they should nevertheless
   come to offer sacrifices to God. By the peoples some understand the
   other tribes, which does not appear at all consistent; and others,
   foreign nations, to which their commercial intercourse gave them
   access. My interpretation, however, is simply that, although the length
   of the journey should invite them to remain at home, still they should
   mutually exhort each other to betake themselves in large companies to
   the temple. The end of the verse may be the statement of a reason for
   this, as if it were said, that they will be more attentive to the
   service of God, because, being enriched by him, they will be desirous
   to offer Him the praise. And assuredly it is a sign of gross
   ingratitude, when we are not stimulated by God's blessings to strive
   more earnestly to render thanks to him, in proportion as he deals more
   liberally with us. At the same time, Moses shows that, in consideration
   of their great wealth, the expenses of the journey would be by no means
   onerous to them; for, although their country was not very fertile,
   still its position was most advantageous for the acquirement of riches.
   Thus when it is here said, "they shall suck of the abundance of the
   seas," an antithesis is to be understood between the fruits of the
   earth and the abundant revenues derived from merchandise. To the same
   effect, "the treasures hid in the sand" are spoken of. For the
   exposition given by some, that their treasures should be so great as
   that they should hide them in the sand; and by others, that the sands
   should there be so prolific in silver and gold; and by others, that
   they should collect what the sea should throw up, is poor and vapid.
   Whereas, therefore, others should grow rich from their lands, Moses
   says, by an elegant figure, that the sands of Zebulun should be filled
   with hidden treasures, on account of their foreign traffic.

   20. And of Gad he said. In the blessing of the tribe of Gad, mention is
   only made of the hereditary portion, which it had obtained without
   casting of lots. He therefore celebrates the blessing of God, because
   He had accorded to the Gadites an ample dwelling-place; for the word
   "enlargeth" refers to the extent of their possession. But inasmuch as
   in that extremity of the land beyond Jordan, they were on a hostile
   border, he declares that they would be warlike, and hence compares them
   to a lion, which tears its prey sometimes from the head, and sometimes
   from the arm. Since, then, that position would not be so peaceful as
   any other region in the midst of Canaan, he declares that they should
   be safe and sound, through their own audacity. And although it is not a
   very pleasant condition to be harassed by constant wars, still, in such
   a disagreeable case, God's grace was not to be despised, which made
   them formidable to their enemies, and of great valor, whereby they
   might not only repel hostile invasions, but be willing of themselves to
   make predatory expeditions. If any should object that license for
   rapine was quite unsuitable for God's children, the solution is
   obvious, that reference is not here made to what was lawful, or what
   was desirable and praiseworthy, but that a consolation was offered them
   by way of protection against the incursions and annoyances of their
   enemies. Besides, the lust for booty is not made permissible, but
   praise is merely given to their courage in overcoming their enemies.

   21. And he provided the first part for himself. [322] Others translate
   it not badly, the first-fruits. Jerome's rendering, pre-eminence
   (principatum,) however, is quite out of the question. The word
   beginning (principium,) however, is very suitable, for Moses thus
   signifies that the Gadites were beforehand in seeking a dwelling-place
   for themselves; for before possession of the land was accorded to the
   people, they asked for the kingdom of Sihon for themselves. It is
   afterwards added, in what way they were provident in choosing their
   abode, namely, because God suggested to them that Moses was at liberty
   to assign this portion to them. For it is called the "portion of the
   lawgiver," as being that respecting which Moses might lawfully decide,
   since he appropriated it to the Gadites, not by hazard, nor otherwise
   than by God's command. It is called the hidden portion, [323] as not
   having been included by God in His promise. The sum is, that although
   God's will was not yet revealed, with respect to this addition to the
   land, still they obtained it through His secret liberality. And Moses
   desires flint his decision with regard to the Gadites remaining on this
   side Jordan should be thus confirmed, since disputes might have
   otherwise arisen, inasmuch as God's promise had assigned the boundaries
   of the whole people on the opposite bank. Theirs is a poor exposition
   who explain it that Moses was buried there; and those also violently
   wrest the words, who understand by "the lawgiver" the chiefs of the
   Amorites, and render the words "hidden portion," the ceiled palaces;
   [324] nor would they have been thus extravagant in their notions, if
   the natural meaning which I have given had occurred to them.

   The other clause of the verse is added by way of qualification; for
   Moses shows that this advantageous provision was made for the children
   of Gad, on condition that they should accompany the other tribes, and
   not return home until the land of Canaan was at peace, and their
   enemies subdued. And we have already seen that, when they sought for
   themselves this location outside the land, in the kingdom of the
   Amorites, they were severely rebuked by Moses, until they promised that
   they would share the war with their brethren until its conclusion. This
   is what Moses means by "executing the justice of God, and his judgments
   with Israel;" not only because it was but just that they should share
   the war with their brethren, and assist them in obtaining possession of
   the land, but because God ordained that His just vengeance should be
   executed upon those heathen and wicked nations by the whole of Israel,
   and had chosen all the tribes generally to be the ministers of His
   judgment; as it is said, in Psalm 149:7, 8, 9, that they were charged
   "to execute vengeance upon the heathen, to bind their kings with
   chains, and their nobles with fetters of iron; to execute upon them the
   judgment written;" for it was no common honor to be appointed to be, as
   it were, the judges of the ungodly, so as to destroy them all, and thus
   to purify the land.

   22. And of Dan he said. He foretells that the tribe of Dan, like that
   of Gad, should be warlike, not so much from voluntary disposition, as
   from necessity; for their love of war was not to be deemed
   praiseworthy, inasmuch as it is altogether contrary to humanity; but
   because the unscrupulousness of the enemies, by which that tribe was
   infested, compelled them to take up arms. He compares it to a lion
   impetuously leaping from Mount Bashan; and the particle of comparison
   must be understood here, for Mount Bashan was not situated in the
   territory of this tribe. But Moses means to say that they should be as
   ready for the combat as a lion, which, after it has issued from its den
   into the open plains, makes an attack upon every one that it meets.

   23. And of Naphtali he said. He predicts that God would deal
   bountifully towards these two tribes; for to the first a fertile
   district would be allotted towards "the west and the south." What he
   declares respecting the tribe of Asher is not free from ambiguity; for
   he is said to be blessed, mvnym, mibanim, i.e., either with children,
   or above children. If we prefer the former meaning, his prolificness
   (poluteknia) is celebrated, as though it were said, Asher shall be
   blessed with a numerous progeny. There may, however, be a comparison
   between this tribe and the others; and this might justly be made to its
   advantage, because it had a very fertile district allotted to it, and
   abounding in wheat of the best quality, as the blessing of Jacob
   testifies,

   "Out of Asher shall bread be fat, and he shall yield royal dainties."
   (Genesis 49:20.)

   He adds that "Asher shall be acceptable to his brethren;" from whence
   we gather that his tribe should be of a placid disposition: and
   afterwards figuratively celebrates the abundance of his oil, and iron,
   and brass. For to "dip his foot in oil," is as much as to say that he
   should collect an abundant supply of oil; and that "his shoes should be
   iron and brass," is nothing more than that he should tread upon a soil
   full of these metals. It is to be readily inferred from hence, as from
   preceding passages, that the blessings, which are now mentioned, are
   not so much wishes or prayers, as prophecies; since without the spirit
   of prophecy Moses could never have divined what, or what sort of,
   territory was to be bestowed on the several tribes.

   Commentators vary as to the latter words; for some render the word dv',
   daba, old age, or, grief, as if there were a transposition of the
   letters, [325] and thus restrict the meaning of the word "days" to
   youth; but others more correctly suppose, that Asher was to be strong
   and vigorous through the whole course of his life. Since, therefore,
   years gradually debilitate men, Moses promises to the posterity of
   Asher that their rigor should be retained to the very end of life.

   26. There is none like unto the God. Moses proceeds from the parts to
   the whole, and now comes to speak of the whole body, which consisted of
   the twelve families. All that he says tends to the same end, viz., that
   the people of Israel were happy as being taken by God under this
   faithful guardianship: for nothing is more to be desired with regard to
   our best interests, than that our welfare should be intrusted to the
   hand of God. But, since this inestimable blessing of being protected by
   the care of God is often but lightly prized, Moses exclaims in
   admiration, that there is none to be compared to the God of Israel. We
   know that all nations had their tutelary gods or patrons, and foolishly
   gloried in their respective idols; although they often found from
   experience, that whatever confidence they placed in them was vain and
   frivolous. Moses, therefore, separates from this imaginary multitude of
   false gods the God of Israel, like whom, he says, none can be anywhere
   found. He also extols His power, because He rides gloriously on the
   heavens and clouds, which is tantamount to all high things being
   subject to His dominion. But, whereas it would be of little profit to
   reflect on his infinite power except; in its connection with ourselves,
   Moses expressly reminds us that God is not strong for Himself, but in
   order that He may help His people.

   27. The eternal God is thy refuge. This is just as if he had said that
   the Israelites were protected from above by the help of God, and also
   based, as it were, upon Him. The beginning of the prayer corresponds
   with that other in Psalm 90:1, "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling-place
   in all generations." The sum is, that although the Israelites might be
   exposed to many injuries, still there was secure repose for them under
   the shadow of God's wings; and assuredly unless the hand of God had
   been like a roof to protect them, they would have perished a thousand
   times over. But, inasmuch as it would not be sufficient for our heads
   to be in safety, the other point is also added, viz., that God's arms
   should be stretched forth to sustain them from beneath. He calls them
   "everlasting," because the security of the pious, who rely upon God, is
   never shaken: it is, therefore, just as though he represented God to be
   at the same time the foundation, and the roof, of their abode. Others
   translate it less correctly, "Thou shalt live under the arms of the
   Everlasting;" for an elegant distinction is drawn, [326] which,
   however, tends to the same point, when God it called qdm, kedem, and
   His arms lm, gnolam, the first of which words has reference to the
   past, whilst in the other there is allusion to the future; as if he had
   said of God, that He was from the beginning, and that His power would
   endure unto the end.

   He adduces experimental evidence of the above statements, inasmuch as
   God had [327] miraculously destroyed the enemies of His people; at the
   same time he specifies the manner in which this was done, viz., that He
   had said, Destroy, or blot out, or dissipate. And by this word he
   signifies that, although God had made use of the agency of the
   Israelites, still He only was the conqueror; since the Israelites
   prevailed not except at His bidding, and by His will.

   28. Israel then shall dwell in safety alone. [328] The beginning of the
   verse is by no means obscure, for Moses promises in it to the elect
   people what all have naturally a great desire for, viz., peace or
   tranquillity; for he is said to dwell confidently alone, who: fears no
   danger, whom no care harasses, and who needs no garrison, or defense.
   This, indeed, God never vouchsafed altogether to the Israelites, that
   they should inhabit their land in security and without the fear of
   enemies, inasmuch as their ingratitude did not allow of it; and
   therefore the prophets, in enumerating the blessings of Christ's
   kingdom, declare that every one should "dwell beneath his own vine, and
   his own fig-tree."

   For "the fountain of Jacob," some have the word eye, [329] and suppose
   it to be used metaphorically for his vision; as though it were said,
   that the quiet and peaceful habitation referred to was to be expected
   by the people from the vision of their father Jacob. Others, however,
   more correctly read the words "fountain of Jacob," in apposition (with
   Israel,) inasmuch as all the tribes derived their origin from that one
   father. In this way the "fountain" will not be only the actual source;
   but the rivulet, or stream, which flows down from it.

   In conclusion, Moses promises that the very sky of the Holy Land should
   be propitious, and benignant.

   29 Happy art thou, O Israel. He again exclaims that happy is the
   people, whose salvation is in God; and surely this is the only true
   happiness; for unless we ascend to the first cause of Salvation, all
   salvations, so to speak, are but transitory. And, since God had honored
   the Israelites alone with this privilege, their condition is here
   distinguished from the common lot of the whole human race. By the words
   shield and sword is meant a perfect defense, as much as to say, that no
   part of their armor was to be sought elsewhere.

   Deuteronomy 34

   Deuteronomy 34:1-12

   1. And Moses went up from the plains of Moab unto the mountain of Nebo,
   to the top of Pisgah, that is over against Jericho: and the Lord showed
   him all the land of Gilead, unto Dan,

   1. Ascendit ergo Moses e planitie Moab ad mentern Nebo, in verticem
   collis qui est e regione Jericho, et ostendit illi Jehova omnem terram
   Gilaad usque Dan,

   2. And all Naphtali, and the land of Ephraim, and Manasseh, and all the
   land of Judah, unto the utmost sea.

   2. Et universam Nephthali, et terram Ephraim, et Manasse, et omnem
   terram Jehuda usque ad mare novissimum:

   3. And the south, and the plain of the valley of Jericho, the city of
   palm trees, unto Zoar.

   3. Et meridiem, et planitiem, vallem Jericho urbis palmarum, usque ad
   Soar.

   4. And the Lord said unto him, This is the land which I sware unto
   Abraham, unto Isaac, and unto Jacob, saying, I will give it unto thy
   seed: I have caused thee to see it with thine eyes, but thou shalt not
   go over thither.

   4. Et dixit ei Jehova, Haec est terra de qua juravi Abrahae, Isaac et
   Jacob, dieendo: Semini tuo dabo illam: videre to feci oculis tuis, at
   illuc non transibis.

   5. So Moses the servant of the Lord, died there in the land of Moab,
   according to the word of the Lord.

   5. Itaque mortuus est illic Moses servus Jehovae in terra Moab,
   sesundum mandatum Jehovae.

   6. And he buried him in a valley in the land of Moab, over against
   Beth-peor: but no man knoweth of his sepulcher unto this day.

   6. Et sepelivit eum in Gai, in terra Moab, e regione Beth-peor: neque
   cognovit quisquam sepulchrum ejus usque ad diem hunc.

   7. And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old when he died: his eye
   was not dim, nor his natural force abated.

   7. Moses autem natus erat centum et viginti annos quando mortuus est:
   non caligavit oculus ejus, neque aufugit vigor ejus.

   8. And the children of Israel wept for Moses in the plains of Moab
   thirty days: so the days of weeping and mourning for Moses were ended.

   8. Et fleverunt filii Israel Mosen in campestribus Moab triginta
   diebus, completique sunt dies fletus luctus Mosis.

   9. And Joshua the son of Nun was full of the spirit of wisdom; for
   Moses had laid his hands upon him: and the children of Israel hearkened
   unto him, and did as the Lord commanded Moses.

   9. Josua autem filius Nun repletus est spiritu sapientiae, quoniam
   posuerat Moses manus suas super eum: parueruntque ei filii Israel, ac
   fecerunt quemadmodum praeceperat Jehova Mosi.

   10. And there arose not a prophet since in Israel like unto Moses, whom
   the Lord knew face to face;

   10. Neque surrexit prophera ultra in Israele sient Moses, quem nosset
   Jehova facie ad faciem.

   11. In all the signs and the wonders which the Lord sent him to do in
   the land of Egypt to Pharaoh, and to all his servants, and to all his
   land,

   11. In onmibus signis et portentis ad quae facienda in terra Aegypti
   Pharaoni et servis ejus, et universae terrae ejus, miserat eum Jehova.

   12. And in all that mighty hand, and in all the great terror which
   Moses showed in the sight of Israel.

   12. Et ia omni manu forti, et in omni terrore magno, quae fecit Moses
   in oculis totius Israelis.


   1. And Moses went. up from the plains of Moab. It is not certain who
   wrote this chapter; unless we admit the probable conjecture of the
   ancients, that Joshua was its author. But since Eleazar the priest
   might have performed this office, it will be better to leave a matter
   of no very great importance undecided.

   We have elsewhere said, that one part of mount Abarim was called Nebo,
   as another was called Pisgah, because they were distinct summits.

   Now, the ascent of Moses was equivalent to a voluntary going forth to
   death: for he was not ignorant of what was to happen, but being called
   by God to die, he went to meet death of his own accord. Such willing
   submission proceeded from no other source than faith in God's grace,
   whereby alone all terror is mitigated, and set at rest, and the
   bitterness of death is sweetened. Doubtless to Moses, as to every one
   else, it must have been naturally an awful thing to die; but inasmuch
   as the testimony of God's grace is interposed, he does not hesitate to
   offer himself without alarm; and Because he was firmly persuaded that
   the inheritance of the people would be there set before his eyes, he
   cheerfully ascended to the place from which he was to behold it.
   Already, indeed, by faith had he beheld the land, and the promise of
   God had been, as it were, a lively representation of it; but; since
   some remaining infirmities of the flesh still environ even the most
   holy persons, an ocular view of it was no slight consolation, in order
   to mitigate the bitterness of his punishment, when he knew that he was
   prevented from actually entering it by the just sentence of God.

   When it is said, that God "showed him all the land," it could not have
   been the case without a miracle. For, although history records that
   some have been endued with incredible powers of vision, so as to have
   been able to see further than the whole length of Canaan; there is
   still a peculiarity to be remarked in this case, that Moses distinctly
   examined every portion of it, as if he had been really on the spot. I
   allow, indeed, that Naphtali, and Ephraim, and Manasseh are mentioned
   by anticipation, but, nevertheless, the Holy Spirit would express that
   every part was shown to Moses, as if they were close beneath his feet.
   Else the vision would have been but unsatisfactory and useless, if he
   had not been allowed to behold the future habitation of the people. And
   to the same effect is also what is afterwards added, that it was the
   land, which God sware to give unto His servants; for otherwise the
   desire of Moses would not have been satisfied, unless he had seen what
   a pleasant, fertile, and wealthy region the sons of Abraham were about
   to inhabit.

   5. So Moses the servant of the Lord died. Since it was mark of ignominy
   to die without the borders of the Holy Land, Moses is honored with high
   eulogy, in order that the Israelites might learn the more to tremble at
   the judgment of God, who did not spare even his most illustrious
   servant. And it is expressly added, "according to the word (or mouth)
   of the Lord," lest they should despise the threatenings which were
   accomplished in so memorable a manner. For, if God spared not His own
   distinguished Prophet, but at length executed upon him what He had
   threatened, how should the ordinary multitude escape?

   What follows, "he buried him," some render passively, "he was buried;"
   and others transitively, "he buried himself;" but in both cases
   improperly; for, whilst they are afraid to assign this office to God,
   they labor to avoid an absurdity which does not exist; since it may be
   gathered from the end of the verse, that Moses was buried by divine
   means, for it is said that his sepulcher is unknown. It is likely that
   an effort to discover it was not omitted, or neglected to be made by
   the people; since it would have been barbarous for them not to
   discharge the last offices of humanity towards such, and so great a
   man. Since, therefore, no signs of his funeral, nor his body itself,
   were anywhere to be found, it might be inferred that he was hidden by
   God's determinate counsel; whilst it is superfluous to discuss in what
   manner God buried him, inasmuch as all the elements are under His
   control. It was enough, therefore, for Him to signify (annuere) to the
   earth, that it was to receive the body of the holy man into its bosom:
   nor was there any necessity to call in the assistance of angels, as
   some think, since the earth would have instantly obeyed the command of
   its Creator. From the Epistle of Jude (Jude 9) we learn that it was a
   matter of no slight importance that the sepulcher of Moses should be
   concealed from the eyes of men, for he informs us that a dispute arose
   respecting it. between Michael the archangel, and Satan: and, although
   the cause of its concealment is not stated, still it appears to have
   been God's intention to prevent superstition; for it was usual with the
   Jews, and it is a custom for which Christ reproves them, to kill the
   prophets, and then to pay reverence to their tombs. (Luke 11:47.) It
   would have, therefore, been probable that, in order to blot out the
   recollection of their ingratitude, they would have paid superstitious
   veneration to the holy prophet, and so have carried his corpse into the
   land, from which the sentence of God had excluded it. Timely
   precaution, then, was taken, lest in their inconsiderate zeal the
   people should attempt to subvert the decree of heaven.

   7 And Moses was an hundred and twenty years old. Again he celebrates a
   special favor of God, viz., that all the senses of Moses remained
   unimpaired to extreme old age, in order that he might be fit for the
   performance of his duties: for thus it was manifested how dear to God
   was the welfare of the people, for which He so carefully provided.
   Some, indeed, though very few, are found, who are capable of public
   government, even to their hundredth year. Already, however, at that
   period, the rigor of the whole human race had so diminished that, after
   their seventieth year, they dragged on their life in "labor and
   sorrow," as Moses himself bears witness. (Psalm 90:10.) It was,
   consequently a conspicuous sign of the paternal favour wherewith God
   regarded His people, that Moses should have been thus unusually
   preserved in rigor and strength. If the powers of Moses had failed him
   long before their entrance of the promised land, his debility would
   have been very inconvenient to the people: yet naturally he would not
   have been so long sufficient for the performance of his onerous duties.
   It follows, then, that when God did not suffer him to fail, He showed
   wonderful consideration for the people's welfare. Mention is specially
   made of his eyes, by synecdoche, yet the sum of the matter is this,
   that he was neither imbecile nor feeble, for neither were the faculties
   of his mind exhausted, nor his body dried up.

   It needs not that I expound at any length, what is added respecting the
   solemn mourning, because I have elsewhere shown, [330] that the
   ancients were particular in their attention to the performance of
   funeral rites, on account of their faith not being as yet so elevated
   from the measure of revelation they had received, as to be easily able
   to forego those external aids to it, for which there is not the same
   necessity under the Gospel. It is natural to man to mourn for the dead;
   and, besides, this mourning was justly instituted in consequence of the
   loss which the Church had sustained; but a ceremony is here recorded,
   which was brought to an end with the fulfillment of the shadows of the
   Law. Our dead are, therefore, now to be buried in such a manner as that
   our grief may be restrained by the hope of resurrection so clearly
   revealed by the coming of Christ.

   9. And Joshua the son of Nun. It is again shown how perseveringly God
   provided for the welfare of the people. We have already seen how, at
   the request of Moses, Joshua was chosen to succeed him. Now, when he is
   about to take upon him his office, "the spirit of wisdom" was imparted
   to him, that it might be effectually manifested that he was appointed
   by God. He had been, indeed, previously endowed with excellent gifts,
   but he was now much more splendidly adorned with the ensigns of
   dignity, in order that his calling by God might be more certainly
   proved; for thus is God wont to furnish those, whom He calls, with
   capacity for action. The imposition of hands was also subjoined, which
   was no empty symbol of God's grace. But inasmuch as I have already
   fully spoken of these things, I now only lightly touch upon them.

   10 And there arose not a prophet. This eulogy seems to have been added,
   that the children of Abraham might place dependence on Moses until the
   manifestation of Christ; for although prophets were from time to time
   raised up, still it was fitting that the superiority should remain with
   Moses, lest they should decline in the smallest degree from the rule of
   the Law. It must be concluded, therefore, that Moses was here placed in
   a position of supremacy, so as to be superior to all the prophets; as
   also Malachi (Malachi 4:4) exhorts the ancient people, in order that
   they may continue obedient to the law of Moses. Two signs of his
   excellency are here recorded, namely, his familiar acquaintance with
   God, and the glory of his miracles. We have elsewhere seen that, by
   this prerogative, Moses was distinguished from the other prophets, that
   God spake to him face to face. For, although Jacob makes the same
   declaration respecting himself, still we know that God was more
   intimately revealed afterwards to Moses; not indeed that He beheld His
   glory in its perfection, but because, in comparison with others, he
   went beyond them all. As regards miracles, though they were wrought by
   others, still none of them came near to Moses in their performance.
