PREFACE

   AN address which I delivered at the Evangelical-Social Congress at
   Darmstadt during Whitsun-week 1903 is here presented in an expanded
   form, with considerable alterations; and I hope the matter at issue is
   thereby brought into greater prominence. The subject proposed for
   discussion at the Congress was the relation between the moral ideas of
   Jesus and the development of social morality to-day. But to the
   Christian community at the present time it is of far greater
   consequence that it should first of all attain and firmly grasp the
   point of view without which it is impossible for these ideas of Jesus
   to be understood.

   The purpose of the following pages is to show that the moral directions
   of Jesus are not complex in their demands, but require of us simply
   that one thing that can alone bestow upon the will singleness of aim,
   and produce in us a steadfast, independent attitude of mind. His words
   are too often used by Christians, not as means to the attainment of
   that free and independent will, but as regulations of unquestioned
   authority because they proceed from the mouth of Jesus. Yet such an
   application of them is actual revolt against them.

   We cannot set aside as unimportant the fact that Jesus sought to lead
   beyond such indolent obedience those He had joined to Himself. To
   understand aright that aspect of His work is to see the moral
   consciousness of man finding in Him its consummation; and if we
   altogether fail to see that, we cannot experience the Person of Jesus
   as in any real sense the power of redemption. Such a power working in
   us Jesus does indeed become if, not merely receiving the doctrine as a
   glorious tradition, by our own experience we prove the truth of the
   claim He made, that in Him sinful men should find strength and peace.
   For this the prime essential is that this wonderful assurance of Jesus
   should be a fact apprehended by us ourselves in such a way that it can
   never be forgotten.

   To Paul, and the community lie represented, it was a fact conveyed in
   the words of Jesus, spoken at the Last Supper. But to ourselves it can
   come home as a compelling fact only when the words of Jesus reveal to
   us that spirit which enables us to gain independence in the inward
   man--that is to say, true life. Unless we have found in Jesus this way
   to discipline and freedom within, it will be impossible that we should
   experience His Person as the way that guides us to the Father. Without
   full reverence, perfect trust cannot exist; but the access unto God
   that is ours through Jesus consists in an absolute confidence in
   Himself which means deliverance from the horrors of spiritual
   isolation. Unless we have had proof of this, we might, indeed, go on
   talking of a drama of Redemption, performed long ages ago; but we
   should have no right to say that He Himself is the Redeemer Whose power
   we now experience. Thus the preaching of the Gospel must needs become a
   mere lifeless repetition or spiritual incoherence, if there is
   increasing failure to understand Jesus in the power of His spirit, or
   the meaning of His law.

CHAPTER I

  INTRODUCTORY

   IN the year 1694, H. A. Francke was profoundly moved by the saying of
   the Apostle Paul: "God is able to make all grace abound toward you;
   that ye, always having all sufficiency in all things, may abound to
   every good work." The words henceforth never lost their hold over him,
   but became the source and impulse of his activity. The origin of very
   much that has since been done in our country in the name of Christian
   charity may be dated from that time, and the bold confidence expressed
   in the Apostle's words has led to the accomplishment of projects that
   at one time appeared impossible.

   And now, after two hundred years, there is again especial need of that
   same confidence. It is not that we belong, as did Francke, to a Church
   in which the duty of Christian charity is neglected, but that the
   nature of that duty itself has clearly changed, and is now so new and
   so vast that all our old methods appear inadequate. It seems to be no
   longer a problem with which individuals can deal, and the principal
   object of this Congress is to take counsel together, with a view to
   right action. While particular points require to be discussed on the
   lines appropriate to each, it is essential to have the whole question
   set clearly before us, to see plainly what it is we are aiming at, and
   examine the means at our disposal. We are not, however, now concerned
   with the problem of social questions in general, but with the duty of
   the Church and the Christian community.

   Such a duty is obvious if we are to apply the Gospel to present
   circumstances, and I can easily understand the radical tendency of some
   who would exclude all remoter matters. It is true that historical
   retrospect is not always free from danger. A good steersman must look
   ahead, not behind; and a backward glance over the past may check bold
   action, and see impossibilities where really it is only a question of
   difficulties. Furthermore, history can never throw light on the path
   that lies before us. Among the members of this Congress, however, there
   will be no doubt that the social mission of the Church to-day can be
   determined only by the help of history, not merely because this is a
   guide to the shallows and reefs to be avoided, but still more because
   the different churches in all their aspects, including that of
   charitable societies, are, in their gradual growth, historic
   institutions. Unless we are prepared to undervalue all the experience
   gained in the course of history, we must make up our minds to preserve
   the links between the present and the past.

   Before proceeding to deal with the problem itself, I must call
   attention to a fact that may well inspire us with hope and gladness.
   Throughout the whole civilised world questions are now being discussed
   concerning economic: arrangements and the relations between capital and
   labour; this is in itself proof that much social work has already been
   accomplished. It is not long since culture, rights and human dignity
   were the monopoly of some few thousands amongst all the inhabitants of
   Europe, while the great masses of people lived dreary lives under
   tyrannous oppression, possessing neither rights nor education, their
   whole existence being one long misery. To-day, on the contrary,--at
   least in our own country, and among many other kindred nations,--all
   citizens are equal in the eyes of the law; all enjoy the same legal
   protection; slavery and serfdom are things of the past; a fair amount
   of knowledge and education are within the reach of all; and labour is
   respected. Liberty, Equality and Fraternity are in many ways no mere
   empty words, but the real framework of our individual and social life,
   the pillars of the building we are raising. All this has been
   accomplished in the lifetime of a few generations, and it is absurd to
   question the fact of progress, amidst improvements so obvious and
   immense.

   Yet the retort is frequently made: What in practice have this Liberty,
   this Equality, this Fraternity proved to be? Have we not been deceived
   by them in the past? Do they not, on the one hand, threaten us with the
   rule of ignorance and folly, and, on the other hand, are they not mere
   catchwords, deprived of real meaning by the dependence of Labour upon
   that Capital which it does not itself possess? The truth,--say these
   pessimists,--is that the old oppression still prevails,--in a different
   cloak, it may be, but, for all that, in an aggravated form; the worst
   kind of servitude is rife; legal equality, besides being imperilled by
   the existence of Capital, is at best but a negative good; and education
   for the masses is a mere possibility, of which they cannot avail
   themselves! Nominally we are all equal; but in reality a minority lives
   as before at the expense of a vast majority, whose members are still
   consumed by cares, and find the rights they have won to be in part but
   a niggardly instalment of their dues, and at the same time a mockery of
   their helpless condition.

   Those who argue thus are not wholly wrong, but they are not right. The
   above-mentioned blessings, in which all are supposed to share, may
   indeed be, and to some extent really are, mere delusions. But just try
   to remove them now, or even to imagine that they do not exist! They are
   great and lasting possessions, won with effort, and none the less
   valuable because not all-sufficient. Blessings they still would be,
   even though at the present time they should result in intensifying
   economic difficulties. Retrogression is no longer possible for us; and
   shame upon those who desire it! Let us rather rejoice in having already
   achieved much that, a few generations ago, seemed but an empty dream.

   I must now, after these introductory remarks, ask you to follow me in a
   historical retrospect. Before entering upon this, however, it is
   necessary to consider the underlying historical question of the general
   attitude of the Gospel towards social arrangements. We shall then
   glance at the successive epochs of ecclesiastical history, and finally
   endeavour to answer the question, What is the social mission of the
   Church of to-day?
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER II

  GENERAL ATTITUDE OF THE GOSPEL TOWARDS SOCIAL ARRANGEMENTS

   THE Gospel is the glad tidings of benefits that pass not away. In it
   are the powers of eternal life; it is concerned with repentance and
   faith, with regeneration and a new life; its end is redemption, not
   social improvement. Therefore it aims at raising the individual to a
   standpoint far above the conflicts between earthly success and earthly
   distress, between riches and poverty, lordship and service. This has
   been its meaning to earnest Christians of all ages, and those who are
   unable to appreciate this idea, fail to appreciate the Gospel itself.
   The indifference to all earthly affairs, which proceeds from the
   conviction that we possess life eternal, is an essential feature of
   Christianity. It is the result of a twofold mental attitude, which may
   be summed up in the following words: "Fear not, be not anxious; the
   very hairs of your head are all numbered"; and "Love not the world,
   neither the things that are in the world." In accordance with these two
   precepts two principles arise. One may be called the tranquil,
   quietistic principle, and the other, the radical; the former impels men
   to acquiesce, with faith and resignation, in the whole course of the
   world, whatever it may be, or, however it may develop, while the latter
   urges them to renounce the world, and live for something new. In the
   Gospel itself, then, a problem is thus presented, for it is obvious
   that between the tranquil and the radical principles there is a
   possibility of conflicts. Indeed, the radical principle, where it
   predominates to the exclusion of the other, allows of further
   subdivision according as it finds expression in one of two
   ways,--either in complete renunciation of the world, or in the attempt
   to do away with all the existing ordinances of the world, as being all
   impregnated by sin, combined with an endeavour to establish a new order
   of world. History will show us how, through directing one-sided
   attention to one or other of these principles, instead of harmonising
   the two, Christians have evaded the difficulty.

   But the same Gospel which preaches a holy indifference to earthly
   things, embraces yet another principle: "Love thy neighbour as thyself"
   This spirit of love likewise is to be a guiding rule of the character
   built up by the Gospel. Accordingly Christianity originally took the
   form of a free brotherhood,--a form essential to its very nature, for,
   after trust in God, the very essence of religion is brotherly love. In
   addition, then, to the quietistic and radical principles we have a
   third,--the social, active principle. I give it this name of a social,
   active principle, because the Gospel nowhere teaches that our relations
   to the brethren should be characterised by a holy indifference. Such
   indifference expresses rather what the individual soul should feel
   towards the world with all its weal and woe. Whenever it is question of
   one's neighbour, the Gospel will not hear of this indifference, but, on
   the contrary, preaches always love and mercy. Further, the Gospel
   regards as absolutely inseparable the temporal and spiritual needs of
   the brethren. It draws no fine distinctions between body and soul;
   sickness is always sickness, and want is want. Thus, "I was an
   hungered, and ye gave me meat: I was thirsty, and ye gave me drink."
   Again, when it is a question of giving signs to prove that the promises
   of God have now been fulfilled, it is said: "The blind see, the lame
   walk--, . . . and to the poor the Gospel is preached"; while in the
   Gospel of the Hebrews we read in the story of the rich young man:
   "Behold many of thy brethren, sons of Abraham, are clad with dung,
   dying with hunger, and thy house is full of much goods, and there goeth
   out therefrom nought at all unto them." [1] Thus, in the simplest and
   most emphatic terms possible, Christians are urged to help the needy
   and the miserable with all the strength of love. But it is to the rich
   that the most earnest exhortation is addressed. While it is assumed
   that wealth tends to make its possessors hard-hearted and worldly, they
   are warned that their perilous possessions impose upon them the highest
   responsibility.

   A new spectacle was presented to the world: religion hitherto had
   either clung to what was earthly, adapting itself readily to things as
   it found them, or else built in the clouds, (and set itself up in
   opposition to everything; but now it had a new duty--to scorn earthly
   want and misery, and earthly prosperity alike, and yet to relieve
   distress of every kind; to raise its head to heaven in the courage of
   its faith, and yet with heart and hand and voice to labour for the
   brethren upon earth. The task thus set them has never been wholly
   abandoned by Christians, who consequently, have held fast the
   conviction that no economic system can oppose to the mission of
   Christianity a really insuperable obstacle, while, on the other hand,
   no economic system can ever release it from its duties.

   But does not the Gospel contain much more than this? Does it not
   include definite teaching on the subject of temporal welfare, and a
   definite social and economic programme? So indeed men have believed,
   both in the early ages of Christianity, in the Middle Age, and at the
   present time; and yet the belief is wrong. Undoubtedly the Gospel
   contains definite teaching concerning temporal good, but none that
   could be summed up in the form of national economic laws, and
   consequently no economic programme. Only if the Gospel or the New
   Testament be regarded as a legal code, can social and political laws be
   found in it; but we have no right to regard it thus, and any attempt to
   do so will speedily end in failure. It is unauthorised, because our
   faith is the religion of liberty, and its duties are specially imposed
   upon you, and upon me, and upon every age, as an individual problem for
   each to solve. And it must needs end in failure, because no
   self-consistent economic precepts can possibly be derived from the New
   Testament. Are we, in accordance with the story of the rich young man,
   to sell all that we have? Or are we, at least, not to lay up treasures
   for ourselves? Or are we, as taught by the Apostle Paul, to turn to
   profit every gift, wealth and property included, but so as to convert
   them into instruments of service? May a Christian never settle vexed
   questions of inheritance? Is it right for him to make large outlay
   only, as in the Gospel story, on ointments; or is this always
   justifiable? May he, or may he not, keep money, in a strong-box?
   "Labour, working with your hands the thing which is good, that you may
   have to give to him that needeth": that surely is the gist of the
   matter, and firm resistance must be offered to all attempts to read
   into the Gospel any other social ideal than this: "You are accountable
   to God for all the gifts you have received, and so for your possessions
   also; you are bound to use them in the service of your neighbour."
   Anything in the Gospel that seems to point in any other direction is
   merely apparent contradiction, or is relevant only to some particular
   case, or results from the undeveloped economic conditions and special
   historical circumstances of the time in which the Gospel arose. An age
   in which capital was almost always hoarded in a useless way, as a dead
   thing, cannot be compared with an age in which it is the greatest
   economic power; and an age which believed the end of the world to be
   approaching is not to be compared with one which recognises as sacred
   the duty of working for the future.

   But conversely, it does not at all follow from the lack of economic
   precepts in the Gospel, that the matter is one which does not concern a
   Christian. On the contrary, where he clearly perceives that any
   economic condition has become a source of distress to his neighbour, he
   is bound to seek for a remedy, for he is a disciple of the Saviour. If
   a man falls into the water, one may help him by simply pulling him out;
   but if any one is imprisoned in a burning house, the exits being fast
   closed, the only way to help him is to effect a change in the
   circumstances: that is to say, to extinguish the fire. The question
   whether such an act belongs to Christian economics, or is simply and
   solely Christian, or should rather be called humane, may be left to
   those who delight in argument. Love knows that it is always bound to
   help in such a way as to render real assistance .

   The Church has from the first availed itself of three means of helping
   the brethren and relieving misery and want; and the same three methods
   are still at its command. The first of these consists in rousing the
   individual conscience, in such a way as to awaken strong, regenerate,
   self-sacrificing personalities. This is the all-important thing; but
   the means to such an end vary; as the Lord's method of teaching shows,
   it may either begin within, and work outwards, or it may penetrate from
   without to the inmost being. But the vital point is that there should
   be a Christ-like personality, and that in every action the power of
   love from one person to another should operate, and make itself felt.
   The kingdom of God must be built upon the foundation, not of
   institutions, but of individuals in whom God dwells and who are glad to
   live for their fellow men.

   The second method consists in converting every congregation of
   individuals into a community full of active charity, and bound together
   by brotherly love; for without such a bond all effort is sporadic. This
   fellowship was strongest in the early days of the Church, and the
   consciousness that Christianity cannot exist upon earth in any other
   form never altogether passed away, although, as we shall see, it became
   enfeebled.

   Then there is still the third line of action. Religion is not
   independent in its growth; even if it takes refuge in solitude, it must
   enter into some relation with the arrangements of the world as it finds
   them, and it cannot regard with indifference the nature of these
   ordinances. It was, indeed, at a time when extortion and violence were
   common, and slavery and tyrannical oppression prevailed, that the
   Apostles instructed the faithful to "take no anxious thought." But at
   the same time they at once began to exert their influence against so
   much of the existing order of things as was in fact disorder and sin.
   Christians were urged so to walk that their example should both make
   others ashamed and incite them to imitation. Only a few decades later,
   representatives of Christianity were presenting petitions to the
   emperors and the governors of provinces, and addressing written appeals
   to society, demanding the abolition of gross and flagrant abuses and
   outrages. But, as far as I can see, the limit of their interference was
   clearly defined: it did not occur to them to propose economic
   improvements, or to attack fixed institutions, such as slavery. What
   they demanded was the suppression of such sin and shame as could not
   but be recognised as sins and scandals even by a Greek or Roman
   conscience. They were convinced that the divine image in man cannot be
   destroyed by oppression and suffering of any kind (never was there an
   age of less sentimentality with regard to want and misery than the
   early days of Christianity); but that it is effaced by uncleanness and
   sensuality, and that therefore conditions which plainly tended in that
   direction,--for example, a tolerated and privileged unchastity, secret
   murder, exposing of children, and wholesale prostitution,--are
   altogether intolerable.

   This brings us to a most important point. At the present time
   Christianity is being reproached with never, at any time in its
   history, having taken the lead in economic reforms. Even if the facts
   were in accordance with this sweeping statement, it would be no real
   reproach, in view of the distinctive character of the Christian
   religion.

   It is enough if religion prepares men's minds for great economic
   changes and revolutions; if it foresees the new moral duties which
   these impose; if it knows how to adapt itself to them, and perceives
   the right moment at which to step in with its forces, and do its work.
   A religion which aims at saving the soul and transforming the inner
   man, and which regards a change in outward circumstances as but a small
   matter in comparison with the power of evil, can only follow in the
   wake of earthly changes and exercise an after-influence; it is not
   qualified to lead the way in economic developments.

   To be sure, that is not the conclusion of the whole matter. It is
   undeniable that the greatest danger of Churches once established has
   always been lest they should become in a bad sense conservative and
   indolent, and should hide this indolence under cover of very lofty
   conceptions of their creed. Instead of helping their poor brother, they
   preach to him that "pious indifference" with which individuals should
   regard their own earthly fortunes. Even in the days when the Epistle of
   St. James was written, Christians would say to a destitute brother:
   "God help you!"--and yet give him nothing. The other-worldly aspect of
   religion was exploited to such an extent that love in this world was
   forgotten, or, in other words, the present world was not forgotten, but
   love was.

   It is no mere coincidence that from the very beginning this perverted
   quietism has always had as its counterpart the tendency which I have
   called radicalism. If indifference towards all earthly matters is to
   take the place of love in determining our relations with our
   neighbours, there is at least as much justification for radicalism as
   for quietism. Therefore let all earthly possessions be forsaken,
   divided equally, or held in common! The fantastic idea, derived from
   antiquity, of Communism in matters economic, has always clung to the
   Church like a shadow, faint at one time, at another more distinct.
   Combined with thoughts of complete renunciation of this world, or with
   material hopes of another world, it seemed to offer the best solution
   to the problem of the evangelical-social mission of the Church, and at
   the same time declared war against indolent indifference. The idea,
   though naïvely conceived, and never really carried out, or capable of
   being carried out, was valuable in so far as it stirred up easygoing
   Christians, called attention to faults in the prevailing economic
   order, and modified obstinate ideas of individual ownership; but the
   merits were outweighed by the disadvantages of the movement. Wherever
   it attempted to practise its theories--indeed, wherever it was able to
   gain a hearing at all--the result was to make men blind to the duties
   nearest at hand and within their powers; it always undervalued the
   simple, personal acts of charity in the interests of its own
   institutions, supposed to be capable of overcoming all evil, and
   eventually it degenerated into the opposite of its own ideals, its
   "heaven upon earth" becoming a degradation of religion. Moreover, in
   those ages of the Church in which the communistic theory was most
   common, religion was most selfish. For the strongest motive that
   impelled towards Communism was scarcely ever brotherly love; it was at
   one time a desire to escape from the world, incompatible with concern
   for one's fellow men; at another time, a longing for earthly welfare,
   encouraged by the self-deluding belief that heaven could be established
   upon earth.

   I have tried to describe briefly the moral attitude of the Christian
   religion towards social questions, and at the same time to call
   attention to points at which an overstraining of certain ideas was
   bound to lead to unfortunate developments. Let us now turn our
   attention to history.

CHAPTER III

  HISTORICAL RETROSPECT

   ANY one attempting to describe the attitude of primitive Christians in
   social matters must above all be careful to distinguish between
   sayings, discourses, mere exclamations, and even theories, on the one
   hand, and deeds on the other--a difference not always sufficiently
   borne in mind. In theory and profession we find an inextricable medley
   of conservatism and radicalism--experimental ideas, so to say;
   everything seems to be pervaded by a radical sentiment, which was
   influenced by "pious indifference" and the prospect of the approaching
   end of the world. Therefore such sayings as these are often found: "Let
   no man call anything his own"; "We have all things in common"; "Forsake
   all earthly possessions,"

   And in times of special stress and severe persecution, such words were
   here and there followed by deeds: some congregation, with a fanatic as
   leader, actually would sell everything, or go out into the wilderness.
   In Asia Minor, indeed, there were enthusiast prophets who, for the
   space of some twenty years, succeeded in overturning the natural order
   of things by persuading thousands of individuals and several whole
   congregations to forsake the world. The further tendency to organise a
   communism, obviously modelled on Plato's "Republic," is noticeable in
   various small heretical communities, without referring to the similar
   attempt at Jerusalem, of which we have no clear account. Such impulses
   are, however, no criterion of the general feeling of the time. In the
   main current of the development of the Church, the whole movement was
   calm, strong, purposeful--moderate in the best sense of the word. In
   the most authoritative and widely-read writings we find the subject
   treated in such terms as the following, taken from the "Epistle of the
   Church of Rome to the Church of Corinth." [2] "So in our case let the
   whole body be saved in Christ Jesus, and let each man be subject unto
   his neighbour, according as also he was appointed with his special
   grace. Let not the strong neglect the weak, and let the weak respect
   the strong. Let the rich minister aid to the poor, and let the poor
   give thanks to God, because he hath given him one through whom his
   wants may be supplied. Let the wise display his wisdom, not in good
   words, but in good works. He that is lowly in mind, let him not bear
   testimony to himself, but leave testimony to be borne to him by his
   neighbour. He that is pure in the flesh, let him be so, and not boast,
   knowing that it is Another who bestoweth his continence upon him."
   Could anything be more moderate?

   But in one point, undoubtedly, all Christians worthy of the name were
   radical, namely, in their opposition to the world of idolatry, of
   impurity, of sensuality, of debasing pleasures, of cruelty and of
   hardheartedness, by which they were surrounded. "To keep themselves
   unspotted from the world" was for the early Christians the highest
   solution of the "social question in primitive Christian days." To fight
   against this world of sin, to suffer and to die rather than be
   entangled in it--this was the fundamental principle. In this war
   against sin, they occasionally went a step further, and protested
   against all that in any way concerns the world and the flesh. But
   surely it is better that a man should despise the blessings of this
   life than disgrace himself by abusing them! Those ascetics and martyrs
   in the fight they fought were fighting for each one of us; they died in
   order that the world of immorality might perish, or at all events might
   hide itself in darkness; that at least the vilest and coarsest elements
   might disappear from the culture and the civilisation that we ourselves
   have inherited. Philosophers of the highest eminence had spoken and
   written in fine language of the dignity of man; but they had winked at
   idolatry, and they did not possess the force of Puritanism against
   either idols or open immorality. But now had appeared a society able to
   convert into power and action its message concerning the worth of the
   immortal soul and the divine sonship of all mankind.

   Next to purity of morals, brotherly love was the outstanding
   characteristic of this society, and we find everything subordinated to
   the main purpose of binding together individual congregations and the
   whole body of Christians into one fellowship, ever ready to help its
   own members and the world around. It was with this end in view that the
   general organisation of congregations, to the extent of including
   bishops and deacons, assumed definite form, and developed with such
   wonderful precision and variety. The bond of brotherhood must not
   merely imply common worship, but must embrace all the relations of
   life. Nothing of the sort had yet been seen; and no institution could
   be compared with it except, perhaps, that of synagogues scattered about
   the kingdom; but these were limited to one nation, and were less
   closely bound together. From the religious standpoint there was a real
   levelling of nationalities, ranks and classes in the Christian
   congregation, and a true manifestation of that equality which consists
   in the common possession of spiritual and eternal blessings. Slaves
   were entrusted with the most influential offices in the Church, and the
   honour and dignity of women were protected, chastity being a
   fundamental principle in "renunciation of the world." Only think, for
   example, to what tender treatment of female slaves certain of the "Acts
   of the Martyrs" testify! But above all, the Gospel really was preached
   to the poor; that is to say, for the first time a spiritual religion
   was brought within the reach of all, even of the humblest classes. In
   order to fathom the full meaning of this, one must study the
   controversies between the heathen Celsus and the Christian Origen.
   Celsus admits, and approves of the fact, that Plato wrote only for the
   educated and the virtuous; his view is that only those answering to the
   Greek "Aristocrats" can reach firm ground in regard to the highest
   questions of life. To Christians, on the contrary, the real proof of
   the superiority and truth of their religion lies in the fact that it
   applies to all sorts and conditions of men: it is not only the religion
   of compassion, but the religion of humanity. The eighteenth century
   simply rediscovered what had already been the possession of Christians
   in the second century.

   It is especially noteworthy that the arrangements for doing practical
   works of love were very closely associated with those of divine
   worship. In the same place in which heavenly gifts were received,
   earthly ones were given as well; in the same place in which people were
   called upon to offer their souls and bodies a living sacrifice to God,
   they offered their earthly gifts for the needs of the brethren. This
   was indeed an incentive to giving, and who need be ashamed to receive
   gifts straight from the hand of God! The same altar-table thus
   expressed the joint ideas of love to God and love to one's neighbour.
   This was the very heart of the "philosophy" which won the admiration of
   the pagans; and this, together with private deeds of charity, became
   the most potent means of propaganda. "Where the common interest is
   concerned, they make no account of cost;" and again, "If one of them
   suffers, they regard it as something touching all." This is the
   testimony of the "scoffer," Lucian. No charitable institutions had as
   yet been established, but the whole body, the congregation, fulfilled
   the functions of a free institution for dispensing brotherly love and
   practical help.

   At the same time the duty of work was inculcated. It was not that any
   special blessing was thought to rest upon labour, but work was
   recognised as a self-evident duty. Therefore it was incumbent upon the
   congregation to help the unemployed and poverty-stricken brethren to
   find work. "To the sick, give relief; to the sound, work," is the
   advice given in an ancient document. No legal maxim of the early
   Christians can be deduced from this; it is a statement of brotherly
   obligation. No one was then thinking of far-reaching preventive
   measures against poverty; for poverty was regarded as a fate, which
   charity was bound to soften. For a similar reason, the deep mistrust of
   the Mammon of unrighteousness rarely or never led to the formation of
   any general rules, wealth too being regarded as a fate, the serious
   consequences of which had to be averted or at least mitigated by the
   exercise of love.

   Political, legal and economic ordinances were in part recognised, in
   part merely tolerated. The subject was taught respect for the Emperor
   and for all in authority, and the slave for his master, while
   conversely the Christian master was to see in his slave a fellow
   Christian. As there were no republican tendencies in early
   Christianity, so too there were no efforts to bring about the
   emancipation of slaves. At the same time it is true that Tertullian did
   not think it possible for an Emperor to be a Christian, and slavery was
   included among the institutions destined to perish with the wicked
   world.

   The Christian was, as far as possible, to leave public and political
   life alone; opinions and practice varied as to the exact degree in
   which he might take part in it, and could endeavour to reform it. Such
   disputes as could be decided without going beyond the congretion were
   not to be carried into the public law courts, and it was a matter of
   course that in questions concerning marriage and family life, the
   Church was to follow the principles of Christianity.

   During the course of the second century a development of great
   consequence gradually took place. From the beginning there had been
   voluntary teachers and missionaries who had made special sacrifices for
   the sake of their calling, enjoying at the same time special privileges
   and esteem; but now these disappeared, and their place was taken by
   elected and official presidents. These did indeed take upon themselves
   some of the obligations of the teachers they replaced, and thus give
   evidence of a high standard of morality; but the privileges of the
   teachers were theirs also, and they tended more and more to become the
   leaders of the congregations. These latter, meanwhile, having grown in
   size, lost their former character, and no longer depended upon the free
   co-operation of individual members with their different gifts, but
   became communities of leaders and their flocks, with a bishop at their
   head. It was a natural and a necessary development, but it tended to
   encourage two propensities hitherto held in check--the indolence of
   some, and the ambition of others, under whose control came the whole
   power and property of the Church. At the same time it was the beginning
   of a new class-distinction within the congregations, altogether
   irrespective of religious and moral qualifications.

   Reference must still be made to one other point: brotherly love was not
   the sole motive for almsgiving; apart from that, to divest oneself of
   part of one's property was accounted as something good in itself. The
   idea of renunciation of the world began to find its way into the work
   involved in love of one's neighbour, and though it would be a mistake
   to be hypercritical in this matter (since living faith in a future
   world and in future bliss is always in itself a moral act, and such a
   faith was here the moving force), it cannot be denied that selfish aims
   and a false conception of "merit" were at work.

   If we look further ahead, we find that the Church, which in the course
   of the third century had developed into a great, clerically-governed
   institution, entered in the fourth century into very close alliance
   with the State, and held in it a position of privilege.

   In its theories with regard to property and economic arrangements, the
   Church was becoming more and more communistic, yet without going the
   whole length, and making the demand that men in general should give up
   all they possessed, or literally have everything in common. Almost all
   the great Fathers of the Church gave expression to utterances such as
   these: "Private property is the root of all strife;" "Possession in
   common, that is, equal ownership, is the natural and original order of
   things;" "Beyond what a man requires for his absolute needs, all that
   he has belongs to the poor;" "The luxury of the rich is robbery of the
   poor;" "What the poor ask is not thine, but their own." But in the
   ultimate issue, all alike are unwilling to surrender the principle of
   voluntary action. Some, and notably Lactantius, do expressly speak of
   Plato's communism as mistaken, and others do not scruple to defend
   riches when rightly used.

   Meanwhile, however, the general feeling seems to have tended towards a
   communism in which the wants of life should not be felt. How is this to
   be explained? Brotherly love was not the one clear, prominent motive;
   other motives were included. First, there was the old esteem for the
   contemplative life, with its few wants as compared with the active
   life; and the influence of Aristotle's "Law of Nature," and Plato's
   "Republic," in spite of the criticism to which the latter was
   subjected. Then there was the stern exigency of the time, which made it
   appear almost a deliverance to be rid of one's all at a single stroke.
   Even those who loved their wealth, but were groaning under the
   unendurable pressure of taxation, might in the end prefer to cast away
   their fortune with their own hands rather than be ruined by slow
   degrees. Moreover, existing social conditions were so tyrannical and at
   the same time so precarious; the rich men, forming a new caste which
   was then growing up, were often so inhuman; and the old hereditary
   failing of the Romans, avarice and love of gain, had reached such a
   pitch that a person with a moderate degree of sensibility might well
   find life in such a world intolerable. Further considerations that must
   be taken into account are the old Christian distrust of the mammon of
   unrighteousness; the difficulty of answering the question as to the
   amount that ought to be given in charity; the conviction that all
   giving is meritorious, and effectual for the saving of the soul of the
   giver; and finally the supposed example in the Bible of the communistic
   Church at Jerusalem. All this is sufficient to explain the tendency
   towards communism and renunciation of the world.

   But, as already pointed out, the result was not communism, but only
   voluntary almsgiving and donations, together with what was perhaps most
   important of all, a certain modification of the selfish Roman idea of
   proprietorship. Property is a trust, held under definite moral
   conditions; this conception was forcing its way in. It is in history as
   in nature: an apparently enormous expenditure of power is required in
   order to produce a new result which is seemingly insignificant.

   The practice of the Church itself was not at all in keeping with its
   communistic theories. Rather does it appear in the light of a great
   conservative power, itself embracing all the old ordinances, and so
   defending at the same time the economic order. Indeed, one may go still
   further, and say that when all else besides itself was falling into
   ruin, the Church, as a firmly established institution, was eventually
   able to turn to its own almost exclusive advantage the legal and
   economic order of the decadent Roman Empire. Thus, when slavery was
   becoming too costly an institution, and, in spite of the efforts of the
   State to prevent it, serfs were gradually taking the place of slaves,
   the Church, while pressing upon its individual members the good work of
   emancipating slaves, was perhaps itself the last slave-owner. This was
   because it had gradually become the wealthiest landed proprietor,
   having obtained great privileges during the stormy times of the great
   migration of nations, when all private tenure was imperilled. It was an
   age of dissolution. "Populus Romanus moritur et ridet;" and amidst the
   general decline, the Church was the guardian of the former culture,
   and, like a great insurance company, treasured up all such
   wealth--spiritual, intellectual, and temporal--as was capable of longer
   existence, and, without arbitrarily changing it, transmitted it to new
   nations. That, it may now be said, was the social function of the
   Church at that time. It did not reform, but it preserved. From that day
   to this, the Church, as an organised body, has felt called upon rather
   to discover and preserve the good forces yet extant in old and moribund
   institutions than to disengage forces full of new life. Thus it took no
   part in determining the issue of the great economic revolution of that
   time, for one can scarcely ascribe any special influence to its
   prohibition of usury, which was commonly ignored.

   The question suggests itself, How did it reconcile its practice with
   its theory? First, by means of a kind of fiction: we mean, the idea
   that it itself, with all its wealth, was nothing but an enormous
   society for the relief of the poor; and, secondly, by very great
   liberality in face of increasing poverty, together with numerous
   beneficent institutions, founded especially during the period from the
   fourth to the sixth centuries, in aid of the destitute of every kind.
   These great institutions, which excited the admiration even of the
   Emperor Julian, by degrees relieved the congregations of the work of
   caring for the poor; but the congregations as such were gradually
   disappearing, and were being replaced by episcopally governed parishes.
   In Germany, for example, congregational Christianity was never even
   seen. Such institutions did undoubted good, but they had entered upon a
   struggle with the misery of the masses, of which none could foresee the
   end; and among individual Christians the feeling that each one is
   responsible for the condition of his brother was becoming increasingly
   weaker. The more the Church dictated to the laity in religious matters,
   the more egotistical its religion became. A church which is only a
   church, and not also a congregation, isolates even its most pious
   members, and so makes them selfish.

   It is, however, impossible to speak of the Church in the days of
   Imperial power without mentioning its momentous influence upon Roman
   legislation previous to the downfall of the Roman Empire. This was a
   great opportunity for social work, and the Church made use of it. It
   was not only in cases of flagrant wrong that noble arid courageous
   bishops faced cruel and unjust emperors and officers of state, and
   protected the innocent, the weak, and the helpless; but from the days
   of Constantine onwards they also exercised a most salutary effect upon
   actual legislation. In the Roman code of Justinian I could enumerate a
   long list of laws the origin of which was influenced by the action of
   the Church. Among these were enactments dealing with the defence of the
   weak, the moral elevation of whole neglected classes, the sanctity of
   marriage, the protection of children, the care of prisoners, public
   morality, Sunday rest, and even questions of property.

   In spite, however, of this influence, the alliance between the Church
   and the world was regarded by the very devout as an evil; and, in
   consequence, people who had practised asceticism in an isolated way
   formed themselves into communities. From the end of the third century
   dates the growth and spread of monasticism, the devotees of "apostolic
   life" aiming at the way of perfection and the sure salvation of their
   own souls, but still without departing from the principle of Christian
   liberty. Thus, while the Church of the world recognised the monastic
   orders, they in turn acknowledged this worldly Church to be a Christian
   institution of second rank. This development ensured what had long been
   imminent--the abandonment of the attempt to introduce effectively into
   the national life of all countries the highest Christian ideal of life,
   as it was then understood. Such monasticism, born of "pious
   indifference," was not originally founded with a view to works of
   charity, and had for long little to do with charity; but it soon became
   an economic power, and that in quite a different direction from what
   might have been expected.

   The Church reached the Germanic peoples, and, in place of the Romans,
   there appeared the Romance nations. These races were the first that
   might fairly be described as children of the Catholic Church, and it
   was consequently among them, and in the Middle Ages, that the Church,
   no longer having a rival in the ancient order of society, was able to
   make really authoritative its theory and practice. Ideas suggested
   wholly by the contemplation of another world ruled both spiritual and
   intellectual life; fear of that other world, and of purgatorial fire,
   together with hope of future bliss, held universal sway. "Pious
   indifference" to earthly concerns and anxiety for individual salvation
   effectually checked all thoughts of this world's natural claims. The
   idea was predominant that earthly things are never more than means,
   form, empty show--if nothing worse. All who thought and reflected at
   all lived in the other world--and how intimate their acquaintance with
   it!--while the rest lived in naïve worldliness, though they suffered
   from a bad conscience.

   In the social system corporate life alone prevailed; the individual was
   no more than a member of a class to which he belonged. It may easily be
   imagined that in such a state of society the nomadic life was a hard
   one. Those in possession of power enforced it sternly; but their
   subordinates were not only governed, but, as a rule, taken care of, and
   regarded their service simply as a law of nature. It was only the
   inequality of wealth and its arbitrary administration that introduced
   into the iron order of social caste some trace of freedom and variety.
   For that very reason this intractable element, and particularly
   commerce, became an object of suspicion.

   The Church did not interfere with the slow process of economic
   development, whereby money as a medium of exchange was substituted for
   primitive payment in kind; on the contrary, as a landowner on a large
   scale, its own position was radically affected by this change--a fact
   no less true of the monastic orders. Even the great reforms of western
   monasticism may, as Uhlhorn has recently pointed out, be regarded as
   illustrating the economic development of the age. Thus the system of
   the Cluniac order was an indication of general economic reorganisation
   in France after the break-up of the Frankish kingdom of the
   Carlovingians. By that time only great monastic foundations--centres,
   as they were, of important agricultural communities scattered all over
   the country--were in a position to provide for the people a new mode of
   existence; while, on the other hand, the forms taken by the mendicant
   orders corresponded to the development of town life and the general use
   of money. The great monastic corporations formed in many parts a kind
   of agricultural circle, within which there was patriarchal care for the
   inhabitants; and, till the thirteenth century, clergy and monks alike
   everywhere belonged to the ruling classes. The services they rendered
   to civilisation, and their philanthropic work, were not, as a rule,
   determined by brotherly love, but rather by a desire to maintain their
   economic position as lords and patrons.

   But although the Church was now fully developed as a hierarchical
   institution, supreme above all, it continued to prescribe to others an
   attitude towards property the very opposite of that adopted by itself,
   and it still hid this inconsistency under the fiction that it was the
   embodiment of charity. And as long as it did, in the persons of its
   great Popes, defend justice and right, and really was a civilising and
   educative, helpful and protective power, men bore with this
   contradiction between theory and practice.

   The theologians of the Church proclaimed community of possessions to be
   the natural and ideal order, and generally proceeded from this to the
   further ideal of freedom from possessions and desires; extolled a
   contemplative life spent in voluntary poverty, and saw in work
   especially a punishment for sin. But when it came to practice, how
   could this Church fight vigorously against involuntary poverty as an
   evil, when it declared voluntary poverty to be a blessing, and deemed
   even involuntary indigence necessary, that there might be scope for the
   virtue of almsgiving? How could it promote activity and work, when its
   highest ideal was still passive contemplation? Almsgiving was all it
   could really encourage; for it was only the existence of misery in the
   world that made it possible for busy people and men of property to be
   saved. There was, indeed, a certain attempt at progress in the
   endeavour to specify the exact extent to which those who are possessed
   of means are really bound to give as a duty. It was recognised that
   there is such a duty, and that was of the highest importance. But the
   precise directions which were drawn up were only rules upon paper,
   which led to pharisaic casuistry, and deadened moral feelings. They
   encouraged the illusion that a man does enough if he gives a little of
   his superfluous wealth to such of his neighbours as are in the last
   extremity of want. This was, of course, not the intention of those
   schoolmen who set themselves to trace in bold outlines a
   Christian-Social state, but many understood it so. How instructive it
   is that the only attempt known in the history of the Church to define
   the extent to which it is a positive duty to exercise charity and share
   one's wealth with others, only succeeded in restricting and paralysing
   love!

   In process of time the result of all this was that rigid and selfish
   ideas of personal property were gradually relaxed, giving place to
   lavish almsgiving and a purposeless profusion of liberality. The Middle
   Ages are sufficient proof that alms cannot cure pauperism. At the same
   time it was during these very Middle Ages that charity often proved
   itself capable of breaking the spell of "pious indifference" and "deeds
   of merit." There were continually appearing great, saintly,
   self-sacrificing men, who preached not only repentance, but also mercy.
   There was a constant succession of these from the eleventh century till
   Savonarola in the fifteenth. They did what is rarely done now even by
   those who are most self-sacrificing: they themselves lived as the poor
   did. And yet these pious and compassionate souls were purposely helping
   to keep open the very wounds they sought to heal, and it soon came
   about again that personal ministration, the duty of neighbour to help
   neighbour, was passed on from one to another, until it was left to the
   very poorest class, who had not strength to take it up.

   The reaction began in the fourteenth century. The Church, whose wealth
   consisted wholly in kind, failed to keep pace with the change by which
   money became the medium of exchange; and the monasteries, as wealthy
   landed estates, became impoverished. The Roman Curia was then gradually
   transformed into a financial department conducted without re-11 ference
   to charity. This it was that gave the impulse to traffic in
   indulgences. At last the laity of different countries discovered the
   contradiction between the preaching and the practice of the Church,
   with the result that, as a financial institution, the Church fell into
   discredit.

   At the same time opinions with regard to work, property and poverty
   began slowly to change, not from any principle, but owing to the force
   of altered circumstances. Men began to feel a vague, yet overmastering
   consciousness of an urgent social duty which could not be fulfilled hi
   the cloister or the cell. So it came about that the mendicant friars
   were no longer monks properly so called, for they now have their place
   and their work in the world. This feeling led to further steps in the
   same direction, and there resulted a kind of semi-monachism and even a
   class of what might be called "fourth-part monks," forming independent
   religious communities, who bound themselves by some of the monastic
   rules, but meanwhile worked for others in all manner of ways, and held
   that feeding the poor was better than a passive life of contemplation.

   At this time, too, owing to the gradual emancipation of the different
   states and nations from the secularised theocracy of Rome, attention
   began to be drawn to the special and peculiar duties of States and
   towns as regards the earthly welfare of the citizens--so much so, that
   a branch of scholastic theology was actually devoted to these points.
   Furthermore, it was then that, in place of the class-divisions and
   castes of the Middle Ages, the idea arose of individual personality,
   its rights and its value. In the towns, both the happiness caused by
   vigorous work on the one hand, and the pressure of want on the other,
   helped men to recognise that earthly welfare is in itself good, that it
   has a significance of its own, and yet is closely connected with
   morality and with eternity. With such a conception, the object of
   charity once more became simple and straightforward, while at the same
   time new methods were demanded, so that in this direction, as well as
   in others, the way was being paved for the Reformation.

   But all effort was still held in check by the fear of the other world
   and the idea of reward, which argument and persuasion were alike unable
   to overcome. Apart from some attempts at municipal relief of the poor,
   everything as regards social and charitable work was, at the close of
   the fifteenth century, in exactly the same position outwardly as it had
   been during the thirteenth century. Mendicancy still ranked as a
   profession, as an art even, and as "work;" while aversion to labour was
   still a widespread evil, encouraged by the endless holidays of the
   Church. The moral consciousness of the time had not as yet come to
   regard want and misery in a new light. The large displacement of wealth
   during the period of transition to the new money currency, the
   tremendous fluctuation of prices, the ruin of whole classes and their
   subsequent concentration of effort upon the re-establishment of their
   own position--all this tended to provoke great economic crises;
   malcontents indulged in bitter cursing of ecclesiasticism, and saw in
   the prevailing conditions of Church and State the kingdom of Satan and
   of Antichrist. But all they could set up in its place was at best the
   old communistic ideal, of which the Church, in its monachism, had long
   ago made unsuccessful trial. More often it was a strange and naïve
   medley, in which the Franciscan freedom from earthly needs was mingled
   with very terrestrial covetousness, seeking to satisfy itself by force,
   on the ground that the existing order was near its end. It was only
   towards the close of the period that there began to emerge certain
   demands capable of realisation and full of promise for the future.

   At this juncture came the Reformation. Its political and social
   teaching took its tone entirely from the conditions which had been
   growing up during the two preceding centuries, and from these it would
   almost be possible to infer the views of the Reformers with regard to
   social and economic questions. But the novel feature was that they now
   claimed the authority of the Gospel, and thus for the first time rested
   upon a religious basis. What were these ideas, and in what practical
   results did they issue?

   The underlying theories found expression in Luther's "Sermon on Good
   Works," his "Letter to the Nobility of Christendom," his "Treatise on
   Christian Liberty," and others of his writings. Serious as he was, he
   too did full justice to that fundamental idea which, in the primitive
   Church and in the Middle Ages, had shown itself as "Pious
   Indifference;" only he understood it in its purest, simplest, and most
   vigorous sense, that is, as unshakable confidence and trust in God;
   arid for that very reason it no longer appeared merely as a quietistic
   element, leading to renunciation of the world, but also as an active
   motive, able to overcome the world: the faith of a Christian makes him
   free, and gives him the mastery over all things. That is one point, and
   the other is a return to brotherly love, in place of the selfish
   refinement to which almsgiving had been reduced. By simplifying the
   idea of brotherly love, new depth was given to it, and it came to mean:
   "A life freely given to others, in glad and willing service." The
   Reformation sapped the very foundations of the pretended "merit" of
   good works, by insisting that only by grace and through faith can we
   have any dealings with God. Consequently alms and good works ceased to
   be regarded as worth anything in themselves, but were accorded their
   due value in a life of steady work at a useful calling, the main point
   being that a man should not live to himself, but unto God and for his
   fellow men, since through love a Christian shall be servant of all.
   Moreover Luther appreciated the fact that love of God and of one's
   neighbour are inseparably connected. Only he differed from those who
   had gone before him in recognising more fully their inner unity, for to
   him all secular work, performed in faith, and of public utility, was
   worship. Charitable and social work of every kind thus became one
   special side of a general course of action, prompted by a constant
   frame of mind, and finding scope in the ordinary business of life.
   Luther's indignation against useless and excessive almsgiving was
   extended to that so-called "Love" which was content to wait until the
   sufferer was at the last extremity, and then to do such a minimum as
   would satisfy the bare demands of duty. He also recognised that earthly
   blessings are blessings, although of a minor order; and work, when done
   in the right spirit, was valued more highly by him than by the
   theologians of the Middle Ages, inasmuch as it was no longer regarded
   as mere "negotium," the negation of "otium," but rather as a joyful
   exercise.

   Such convictions necessarily gave rise to new principles for the
   guidance of social work. Of these I shall mention only the most
   important: first, real and effective assistance must be rendered,
   genuine help being the ultimate, and indeed the only, object; secondly,
   it is to be given not to the lazy, but to the helpless; thirdly, the
   aid given must be duly proportioned, and not excessive; fourthly, there
   must be method in relief; fifthly and lastly, such social ministration
   is especially incumbent upon municipalities: authorities generally,
   and, in short, the whole civil power, for to its care God has committed
   the temporal welfare of the people, though, first of all, it must
   recognise its own Christian standing, and act accordingly.

   During the Reformation period a certain beginning really was made
   towards carrying out all these ideals. Here and there existing means of
   relief were combined and centralised, guardians of the poor were
   appointed, a general relief fund was started, and poor rates were
   levied. But unfortunately the final results may he summed up in a word:
   in the end nothing of importance was achieved. Indeed, it must further
   be admitted that the Roman Catholics are justified in asserting that
   theirs, not ours, was the revival of charitable work in the sixteenth
   century, and that, as far as Lutheranism was concerned, the practical
   social problem was soon in worse plight than before. How is this
   disappointing fact to be accounted for? How was it that the movement
   which had led to the formulation of new and better principles, did, as
   a matter of fact, produce hardly any improvement?

   There is, even now, a great deal to be learned from the answers to
   these depressing questions.

   In the first place, it must be remembered that in spite of the high
   esteem in which Luther had always held civic authority and the State,
   his original intention was to reconstruct the Church on the simple
   basis of government by the congregation. He had visions of a
   congregational life founded upon fellowship, and on principles of
   Christian liberty, fraternity and equality. It was further his idea
   that the national element should find free expression--only the nation
   then meant the Roman Empire of German nationality--and he had in view
   an improvement in the general economic condition of the country, an
   increase in its culture, and the upraising of down-trodden classes. Not
   that those were in his eyes separate and independent ideals; rather he
   was convinced that a return to the Gospel would inevitably bring about
   their realisation. Therefore there was no immediate need to press them;
   he could afford to wait, if necessary; only the Gospel must have free
   course.

   But he could not expect that this conception would be generally
   understood. His message was hailed by classes numerically powerful,
   though still groaning under the oppression and want which they were no
   longer sufficiently servile to tolerate. These were the peasantry of
   Southern and Central Germany, and the poorer class of artisans. It was
   just at that time too that their demands had become articulate, and
   their strength and their deserts both seemed to entitle them to claim
   from the privileged classes a recognised status of their own. The time
   seemed, moreover, to be nearly ripe for the realisation of that ideal
   state in which all ranks should be knit together in one great bond of
   brotherhood; the privileges of the clergy, of the nobility, and of the
   guilds be curtailed; and the nation be established on a new social
   basis. No wonder, then, that the downtrodden and oppressed hailed with
   gladness the works of Luther, and understood them to confer upon the
   deliverance that had been planned the sanction of the Gospel. "It is
   the will of God;" this was the interpretation put upon his writings.

   You know how it ended. All were to blame, but most of all those
   princes, rulers and cities by whose authority the movement, having
   become revolutionary, was quenched in streams of blood. Nor was Luther
   himself innocent. One may draw a fine distinction and say: "He
   committed no fault, yet he was not innocent;" or it may be asked in
   return how he ought to have acted; but, in spite of all excuses, one
   fact is obvious, that ever since the days of the Peasant-War both the
   German State and the German Evangelical Church have had a debt to pay
   and an obligation to fulfil. Unless appearances are utterly deceptive,
   in those days a great opportunity was wasted.

   Nothing came of the programme, which had aimed at making the
   congregation the broad basis on which to build up the Church, and at
   knitting together in brotherly unity all classes, sharing equal
   privileges; and the new Church that had suddenly come into being was
   destined to be organised and managed by the secular authority, the
   princes of the land, and by theologians.

   But even though the original ideals were abandoned, how did it happen
   that so deplorably little was accomplished in the way of social
   work--in some directions less even than before? Why did not the
   newly-formulated principles I have mentioned bring forth at least a
   scanty harvest? The fact is that a variety of reasons contributed to
   this result. In the first place, theologians had dwelt too exclusively
   on pure doctrine, and their tenet, that no amount of good works can in
   themselves be anything but defective, was not calculated to inspire men
   with energy and self-sacrificing zeal. They were right in excluding the
   theory of merit, only they required first of all to educate their
   hearers up to a higher conception. The lazy and selfish were glad to be
   told that God cares nothing for good works. In the second place, the
   collapse of the congregational idea soon caused the sense of fellowship
   to fail also; and without that, nothing on a large scale can ever be
   accomplished. It became a familiar notion that those in authority ought
   to do everything, although they were in fact doing less and less.
   Moreover, the general distress again increased after the Peasant war.
   The number of idlers, voluntary and involuntary, was immense; and no
   joy in work could be awakened in a people that was not free. Yet
   another reason lay in the financial position of the Lutheran country
   churches, which before long became exceedingly embarrassed. Without
   means of their own, and soon reduced to mere dependencies of the State,
   they were often obliged to be content with a wretched endowment for
   clergy and schools. The "general fund," where there was one, dwindled
   away, while the immediate care of the poor, undertaken without
   experience and with untrained forces, was as before transferred from
   one to another until it became nobody's duty. Furthermore, the new
   prerogatives of German princes and the introduction of Roman law
   enabled the Roman idea of private ownership to force its way in again,
   and to oust existing and better views on property. Finally, spiritual
   poverty and paralysis were everywhere characteristic of the later
   representatives of Lutheranism. Everywhere their horizon was of the
   narrowest; how then could anything of importance be accomplished in any
   direction? That was the state of affairs when the Thirty Years' War
   broke out, and almost cost our nation its life.

   But things looked very much better in the Reformed than in the Lutheran
   Church. For in the Reformed Church congregational control really did
   exist; its members were more actively energetic, because they did not
   confine themselves exclusively to preaching the pure word of God, and
   because they were generally not in a position to rely upon the secular
   authority. They borrowed New Testament institutions and points of view
   for the conduct of their ecclesiastical and social affairs; they
   revived the original diaconate of the early Church; they sought, in
   contrast to Roman Catholicism, to train up a new and really Christian
   society, and they succeeded in doing so.

   Lutheran Protestantism produced nothing to be compared with the
   spectacle of refugee communities of the Reformed Church, Presbyterians
   in Scotland, and Huguenots in France. These revealed the growth of an
   evangelical people, who did not stop short at mere care of the poor and
   charitable effort--a people in whose midst religion knit all classes
   together with brotherly bonds of unity, and who really did create a new
   social order of fellowship without communism. The Puritans, indeed, who
   founded the States of New England, were for whole generations a
   standing proof that a community in which religion and morality are as
   powerful as law, is possible upon earth.

   Here in Germany the immediate consequences of the Thirty Years' War
   showed themselves in the lamentable growth of the divisions that
   separated class from class, and in the establishment of an absolute
   government, supported by the nobility. It may be that in no other way
   could even the small amount of culture that was left have been
   preserved. It was then, however, that the Lutheran Church showed that
   it was not yet powerless, but possessed, as it were, hidden treasures,
   only waiting to be brought to light. This brings us to the first
   beginnings of the present epoch, for we are still in the process of
   development that commenced with the appearance of Pietism on the one
   hand, and of the Enlightenment on the other.

   Pietism it was that revived the dormant consciousness of Protestantism,
   together with the sense of philanthropic obligation. By treating
   religion as an all-important and personal matter, and encouraging
   warmth of feeling, it at once brought into prominence the neglected
   duty towards one's neighbour. To the founders of Pietism we owe the
   great impulse then given to active charity and care of the poor, on the
   part of municipalities as well as of private individuals and societies.
   To their example is mainly due all the work of Christian charity
   performed by Christian associations from that time to this. But the
   Pietistic movement was always confined within somewhat narrow limits,
   and selected its methods in deference to a one-sided principle. It was
   determined to accomplish everything by means of institutions, and it
   made no use of congregational organisation, of which, indeed, only a
   wretched travesty survived. The need of trained forces everywhere,
   rather than of a few amateur dispensers of charity, was not understood,
   nor yet the fact that the whole nation had to be educated and elevated;
   the magnitude of this task was for the most part beyond the
   intellectual horizon of the Pietists; and at that time, indeed, where
   was the German nation? Another power was required to give impetus to
   such a work as that.

   In the whole of history there is, perhaps, nothing more remarkable than
   the rise of the Enlightenment movement towards the end of the
   seventeenth century, and the story of the changes it underwent before
   it became the Socialism of to-day--a gradual evolution which furnishes
   more than one example of the phenomenon known as direct and retrograde
   motion.

   The starting-point of the movement was the idea of absolute
   government--primarily in the sense of the absolute power of the
   sovereign --together with that of the supreme right and duty of the
   State to care for the welfare of the citizens. Under pressure of this
   idea, all that remained of the rights of the Diet, and of historic
   forms and institutions generally, was swept away, excepting only such
   formalities as were connected with the Court. But from their very ruins
   there arose, like the phoenix from the ashes, the idea of humanity. The
   ideal which ancient philosophers had long ago declared to be the
   natural system, and which in the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries had
   seemed to be on the point of realisation--only to be lost again in the
   din of theological conflict--now reappeared and attached itself to the
   new conception of the rights of man, as proclaimed and expounded by the
   inspired prophet of this doctrine, Rousseau. Whatever the history of
   its growth, the idea was there, gained ground, and succeeded in raising
   out of the darkness of world-weariness and pessimism into the radiance
   of the gladdest and most confident optimism all the ideals that had
   hitherto passed muster in religion, transferring them from the history
   of the past into a glorious future, to which it looked for their
   realisation. Only one step, it promised, and the victory would be won!
   If individuals and nations would but consider their own interests, if
   they would but will it, they could at a single stroke make happiness
   their own; freedom of development would be possible to each one, the
   highest sense of well-being would be attained, and every one might then
   with joy and gladness reach out his hand to his brethren, sharers in a
   free self-realisation. Liberty, Humanity, Happiness--these were the
   watch- words, and this was the Gospel preached. Meanwhile our country
   was wretchedly poor, its lower classes being uneducated, in bondage,
   destitute of rights, always on the verge of starvation! The nobility
   first took up the new idea, and toyed with it; but its mighty power was
   soon reflected in literature. Then it caught hold among the middle
   classes, forced its way in the most developed country, France, and
   penetrated by degrees to every nation in Europe.

   Whatever be thought of this movement, there are two points on which all
   will agree. In the first place, the eighteenth century clearly II
   bestowed upon us certain blessings that can never again be taken away,
   namely, the recognition of the rights and personal value of each
   individual, and a sense of the dignity of humanity as a whole. These
   blessings are, indeed, contained in the Gospel. They had been brought
   to light again by the Reformation; but it had failed to turn them into
   living realities. Secondly, it will be admitted that it was a frail
   foundation on which the Enlightenment sought to establish these
   blessings; further, that they were never obtained, but always involve a
   problem ever new, and that their realisation demands sacrifices--very
   substantial and personal sacrifices--of which the Enlightenment did not
   even dream. Its promoters failed to see that the stumbling-block in the
   way of the "happy man" is no less formidable an obstacle than man
   himself--that is, the natural, selfish man.

   We do not deny to the Enlightenment credit for the blessings to which I
   have referred. On the contrary, we acknowledge with gratitude that to
   it is due the recognition of these truths, together with the origin of
   many convictions, laws and institutions, both social and political, the
   existence of which seems to us a matter of course. This movement it was
   which first indicated a real departure from the standpoint of the
   Middle Ages, and through it the whole aspect of society was changed
   from top to bottom. We confess with shame that there is some truth in
   the poet's parodox, that Rousseau turned Christians into men. But in
   spite of all we owe it, we do criticise the spirit in which the
   Enlightenment has worked, and still works. We join issue with its idea
   of natural Rights, and see in it a dangerous illusion; for helpless man
   does not come into the world with any Rights, but his very existence is
   dependent upon the love he finds there. To the one-sided interest in
   temporal welfare, encouraged by this movement, we oppose higher
   interests--the well-being of the soul, the living God, the blessings of
   eternity. Lastly, we protest against that blindness which cannot see
   that all the ideals of the Enlightenment must end in empty schemes, or
   even become the terrible means of a general disintegration of society,
   if the selfishness in man be not overcome by the action of mighty
   forces of good, bringing gladness in their train. To this the ready
   answer is returned "Yes, of course--altruism; but once the general
   conditions of life are ameliorated, that will come of itself as a
   result either of self-interest rightly understood or of a sort of
   inborn good nature, or of the social instinct." Of all falsehoods and
   delusions, this is about the worst and most mischievous. We shall have
   long to wait before an economic scheme is . framed in which selfishness
   can play no part, or which can make the love of humanity a natural
   outflow of the human heart. The French Revolution and all subsequent
   experiences show that this Enlightenment movement by its own strength
   alone can produce nothing permanent; and that unlimited freedom is not
   constructive, but destructive. It was not until a return was made to
   the old historic lines, and to religion, law, and custom, that form and
   durability could be given to the true and valuable elements in the
   ideas of the Enlightenment.

   It must be admitted that during the first two-thirds of the nineteenth
   century this process was anything but an edifying spectacle, for amidst
   the endless obstacles due to a fierce reaction all progress was
   bitterly and wearily contested. The Church was generally on the wrong
   side, a fact which still rankles in the memory of the nation, and is
   not without influence on the economic struggles of the present day. The
   relations between the different classes, and the state of the country
   generally, might perhaps be happier to-day were it not for this dark
   shadow over the immediate past. Not even the greatly increased interest
   of the Church in philanthropic work during this last century, and the
   grand extension in the scope of its efforts, can suffice to blot out
   that reproach. Just as in the days before the Peasant war, so in those
   succeeding the wars of Independence, a great opportunity in our
   nation's life was allowed to slip by unused, with precisely the same
   effect as before, namely, that of estranging thousands from the Church.
   Meanwhile, a complete change of policy had taken place in one section
   of the Enlightenment movement.

   The simple truth had at length been recognised, that so long as men are
   endowed or equipped with different powers, absolute liberty must
   necessarily lead to the most complete suppression of the weakest.
   Natural science had at the same time come to be regarded as the only
   true form of knowledge possible to man, and, under its influence,
   anything in Rousseau's ideals that did not bear upon material existence
   was entirely brushed aside. "The struggle for existence" became an
   all-powerful magic phrase. This development led to a reaction in which
   the original idea of the absolute supremacy of the State again came to
   the fore: out of Individualism arose a demand for Socialism, as being
   the only possible means of satisfying the pretensions of the
   individual-a result not to be achieved by means of unrestricted
   liberty, or, in other words, by Anarchy. Our Social Democracy of to-day
   is--at least in part--merely a modified and disguised form of the
   eighteenth century Individualism, and knows no higher ideal than the
   temporal well-being of the individual, and no forces superior to the
   instinct of self-preservation and the universal right of suffrage. The
   word "Social" is introduced partly to conceal, partly to facilitate,
   the unlimited pursuit of a merely individual and earthly happiness. But
   we are all acquainted with this last development, which has made rapid
   way with the march of machinery and increased facilities of world-wide
   intercourse.

   The question now before us concerns our position and our duty at the
   present time.

CHAPTER IV

  THE SOCIAL MISSION OF THE CHURCH OF TO-DAY

   IT may be said that the Social mission of the Church to-day is both new
   in kind and of greater urgency than in the past: not because poverty
   and distress have increased--for that is, to say the least, not capable
   of proof; nor because the Church is more negligent than before in works
   of charity--quite the reverse is true; nor yet because self-sacrificing
   and trained workers are less numerous than hitherto--on the contrary,
   they have never been so numerous as now. In what sense, then, can the
   Church's task to-day be called new and more urgent than in the past?
   Well, to begin with, history proves that new .and urgent duties never
   come to light during the dark days of declining movements. In the
   dreariness and distress that then prevail, all available energy must be
   exerted to hold fast at least the things that remain. It is only in a
   progressive age that the obligation to new and higher action can be
   felt; and so at the present time it is just the progress we have
   already made that thrusts new tasks upon us. In indicating briefly the
   various lines along which we have advanced, I hope to say nothing with
   which you will not all agree.

   First, we have no longer to do with classes in a state of tutelage,
   but, though in some respects they may still be powerless, all have
   equal recognition, and a certain measure of education now belongs to
   all. I need not enter in further detail into this matter, in which the
   immense progress of the last century is clearly shown. It is only in
   small sequestered districts, or under special circumstances, that it is
   still possible for the relief of the poor to take the form of
   patriarchal care or patronage by the upper classes of those beneath
   them. Now that all classes have dealings with each other on the footing
   of legal equality, a similar freedom of intercourse on equal terms,
   whether friendly or the reverse, has become more and more general in
   all the relations of life--a condition towards which the spread of
   education and equality of political rights have been largely conducive.
   This only serves to heighten the contrast between wealth and the lack
   of it, as represented by Capital and Labour, opposed to each other as
   though they were impersonal forces; and to render more intolerable a
   state of affairs in which whole classes of the population, after
   enjoying a good education and acquiring thereby a genuine taste for the
   blessings of culture, must yet spend their lives in such straitened
   circumstances that they are able to appropriate but few of those
   blessings, and are, moreover, liable to be ruined by the slightest
   economic disturbance.

   Secondly, conscience is more alive, and there is a keener sense of duty
   than before with regard to the welfare of all the members of society;
   that is an unmistakable advance, of such cogency as to compel people to
   take part in it outwardly, even if they do not really do so in their
   hearts. Moreover, we have learned to regard poverty and distress as a
   serious social danger, in a sense very different from that formerly
   thought of, while at the same time we have become aware that no
   thorough reform can be effected except by preventive means. The
   obligation arising from the recognition of these facts is an entirely
   new one, such as no past generation ever felt. In coping with it, the
   study of sociology and economics is found to resemble that of
   therapeutics, where attention is more and more being concentrated upon
   hygiene, the science of preventive measures.

   Thirdly, everything to-day is dominated by the mighty power of an
   economic system embracing the whole world; nothing can escape it; its
   influenee is felt on the remotest village handicraft; it alters or
   does. away with existing conditions, and threatens with insecurity the
   economic existence of whole industries. No wonder that it also affects
   the organisation of the Church; to mention one point alone,
   congregational life is endangered by those facilities for migration
   which follow naturally upon the improved means of communication
   throughout the world. Both in the great cities, and outside their
   bounds, there is a vast nomadic population--a class of people in whom,
   as every page of history shows, it is very difficult to maintain a high
   standard of morality and religion.

   In the fourth place, we are face to face, no longer with merely naïve
   ideas of Communism, but with Socialistic systems of considerable
   economic development, founded on a materialistic view of life. These
   systems and these views are gaining ground among the nations, and
   already crowds of people are definitely and deliberately giving up, not
   only membership in the Church, but also the Christian Faith, and
   Christian ethics, so that Materialism, theoretical and practical, is
   becoming a power in public life. But even this development can by no
   means he regarded simply from the point of view which condemns it as
   "desertion" or "backsliding." Before talking of desertion, we must
   prove that there was, to begin with, real membership in a corporate
   body. But large numbers, who are now termed "deserters," never did lay
   claim to living membership, and it is only from having been so long
   disguised that this fact now appears the more striking and appalling.
   Such make-believe is, to be sure, under certain circumstances a
   restraining and humanising influence, and one may therefore regret the
   disillusionment. All the same, it is a step in advance when one theory
   of existence is straightforwardly confronted with another. Besides,
   there are even worse things than deliberate materialism, namely,
   absolute indifference or calculating selfishness, endeavouring to get
   what advantage it can for itself from all theories of existence at
   once, and hating every conviction that threatens to destroy its own
   comfort and impose duties upon it.

   These are the principal factors which go to make up the existing
   situation, and they must be kept in view while seeking for an answer to
   the question: What is the special social mission of the Church to-day?
   There are two mistaken notions which I surely no longer require to
   correct, namely, that it is the duty of the Church to disentangle these
   difficulties, and that it is in possession of a sovereign remedy for
   all ills. The Roman Catholic Church does indeed sometimes seem to imply
   that it holds such a secret panacea, and is only waiting for the
   nations to swallow it; but it does not seriously mean it. As a
   Christian Church, it, too, cannot eventually disregard the fact that
   the peace promised by the Gospel is a peace which the world cannot
   give, and that the improvement of economic conditions is not the duty
   of religion. Therefore, when we are speaking of the Social mission of
   the Church--of our Evangelical Church--our object must simply be to
   settle what form, under present circumstances, this task must assume, a
   task always one and the same in its fundamental nature, but differing
   much from time to time in its characteristic forms. So, too, the means
   at its disposal never really change, but the use to be made of them
   varies with the period.

   Above all it must be remembered that the chief task of the Church is
   still the preaching of the Gospel, that is to say, the message of
   Redemption and of eternal life. Christianity as a religion would be at
   an end if this truth were obscured, and the Gospel were to be changed
   into a social manifesto, whether for the sake of gaining popularity, or
   owing to excessive zeal for reform. More than that;. none dare
   ultimately expect more for himself from the message of the Church than
   a firm, consolatory faith, able to triumph over all the troubles of
   life. "What shall it profit a man, if he shall gain the whole world,
   and lose his own soul?" This conviction and the glad tidings of Jesus
   Christ the Redeemer constitute the essence of the Gospel, from which is
   developed that view of life--that is to say, that way of thinking of
   the soul and the body, life and death, happiness and unhappiness,
   riches and poverty--which is the truth, and therefore makes men free.
   But the power that lies in every definite theory of existence is proved
   at the present day by the Socialistic movement. At one of our last
   Congresses it was eloquently demonstrated that it is just to such a
   clear theory of life that the Social-Democratic movement owes its
   strength. Its thousands of adherents do not want merely bread; they
   know full well they do not live by bread alone; they want an answer to
   all the questions of the universe and of life, and for that--for their
   faith--they are ready to make sacrifices. For that very reason, the
   work of the Church is easier at the present time than at any period in
   the past, since never before were so many men filled with such longing
   as to-day for firm and consistent convictions. In spite of social
   divisions and apparent disintegration, there is an all-penetrating
   force which binds men together with close ties of spiritual fellowship,
   namely, Thought and Speech. And the strongest expression of Thought
   will prevail. Men are ready to-day to give anything for a conviction
   that is real conviction--for a belief that really is believed in. Men
   are not so base that they can find satisfaction in the gratification
   and the service of their individual existence; they require convictions
   as to the meaning of life. But the demand is for a faith in which there
   is real faith; and to provide this, constitutes the mission of the
   Church--its task both new and old. It has to proclaim to the present
   generation the living God and life eternal. It has to testify of the
   redeeming Lord, whose person still wins reverence and love even from
   those who are most alienated. Zealously and earnestly it must teach
   that sin is the ruin of mankind and the strongest root of all misery;
   and must preach that truth both fully and freely, in au intelligible
   form, so expressed that all may understand. When that is done, the main
   part of its Social Mission will already be fulfilled. But in order to
   be able to do so, it must ally itself with all real knowledge and with
   truth of every kind, or else it will bring discredit on the message it
   proclaims. It is true that one ray of Gospel light is often sufficient
   to illumine the heart, and make a man free; and the lowliest servant of
   Jesus Christ may prove a true saviour to his neighbour; but in the
   great battle of intellects, where one theory of the universe is opposed
   to another, the victory can only remain with that interpretation which
   is a complete whole, and can prove itself true and strong in every way.

   I said that none dare ultimately expect more for himself from the
   message of the Church than a firm, consolatory faith, able to triumph
   over the troubles of life. The emphasis here is on the words "for
   himself;" it is a very different matter with regard to other people.
   Our historical retrospect has shown us that it is an essential part of
   Christianity to weld the individual members of a congregation into a
   brotherhood full of active life, and then to knit such congregations
   together into a great association of willing helpers, and that when in
   course of time congregational life collapsed, this meant a serious loss
   to the Church. In the early days of Christianity active philanthropy
   was one of the most persuasive methods of propaganda, and Jesus Christ
   Himself preached the Gospel while He went about doing good. If sin is
   at the root of misery, misery and error in turn produce fresh sin and
   shame. Therefore war must be waged upon misery; but to win the day two
   things are essential--personal influence from man to man, and the
   growth or genuine congregational life. Of the first of these there is
   no need to speak at length. We all know that in the end it is only
   personal love that really counts. Institutions and charitable
   organisations touch but the fringe of the matter; only that which
   proceeds from the heart and addresses itself to the heart is of real
   moment as weighed in the balance of eternity. In helping one's
   neighbour, one must set oneself neither above nor beneath him but
   beside him. Brothers, not patrons, we are called to be; and in
   answering this call, Christian charity finds its scope and proper
   work--a work the more necessary the more the relations between the
   classes assume an impersonal form owing to the development in our midst
   of our modern economic order.

   With regard to the second point, it is certain that where there are no
   close congregational ties, all effort remains isolated. We should
   therefore be grateful to those who are now once more calling attention
   to the fact that ever since the Reformation our Church has been called
   upon to build up real congregations, and so to revive a vigorous
   corporate life. The following objection is often heard: "It is too late
   for that now; organisation of that sort is no longer possible; neither
   is it compatible with the bureaucratic constitution of our Church, nor
   yet can living congregations be formed from the kind of Christianity
   professed by the masses and the State." To be sure such a task is hard
   enough, but we need not yet despair of its fulfilment. if we really had
   to abandon it, I do not know where we could turn for help, for the
   service of the congregation is one that no public institutions can
   perform, and for which neither their social work nor their coercive
   measures are any adequate substitute. We have much to be thankful for
   in the survival of the congregation, even in a defective form; and it
   would be a fatal error to despise what remains to us, and search for
   other ideals of organisation. As every one knows and feels, these
   Congregations are in their original intention communities in which all
   distinctions of high and low, rich and poor, are swept away, and class
   differences count for nothing; in fact, just such institutions as we
   have special need of at the present time. Therefore we must do all in
   our power to build them up, and give them life, and then patiently wait
   to see whether their existence will not lead to the gradual
   transformation or abandonment of State-government in our ecclesiastical
   polity. Next to the preaching of the Gospel, the reconstruction of
   congregational life is the chief evangelical-social task now before the
   Church. The pusillanimous, who regard with despair the fulfilment of
   this task, on the ground that existing conditions would never allow of
   such an organisation, would do well to consider the example set by the
   Social-Democratic movement. It has succeeded in creating and
   maintaining, among a migratory population, and in face of obstacles of
   every kind, an organisation closely knit, operative alike in the cities
   and the provinces, both national and international. Why could we not do
   the like? Because, it will be said, that movement is essentially
   concerned with one class, and with a common interest serving as a link
   between its members. But have not we, too, a common interest, and have
   not we a message which unites the different classes in a spiritual
   union? If our congregations neither are nor become what they ought to
   be, it is not the fault of circumstances, but of lack of faith and
   love.

   It is, indeed, certain that we can no longer draw people into
   congregations whose sole end is Divine Service, and that such
   congregations are necessarily without real efficacy. But the early
   Church furnishes a pattern of what true congregational life should be,
   and the lines along which charitable work in the Church has developed
   during the last century point in the same direction. It is no empty
   dream that, in the history of Christianity, there have been
   congregations--capable of supervision, well ordered, bound together by
   close ties--in which, next to divine service, active charity was the
   central point--in which, rather, service to God and active charity were
   merged in one. And dare we say that for us that is unattainable? Nay,
   rather we must keep it clearly before us, as the goal towards which we
   constantly aspire. For this reason all great works of Christian charity
   must not only be fostered and extended, but also made more and more
   congregational in their organisation. Where one congregation is too
   small to do by itself all that is required, several must join together
   so as to form eventually a strong local association. The
   church-building must also be an assembly-hall for the community, or,
   better still, there must be an assembly-hall in addition to the church,
   and people should meet together, not only to hear sermons, but also to
   take counsel about benevolent work of every sort. A true Christian
   sense of honour must be aroused, allowing none to call himself a
   Christian unless he is ready to come forward in person to minister to
   the distressed and. help the needy; and, besides this, there should be
   professional trained deacons and deaconesses at work in every parish.
   Not one of the destitute should any longer be able to say that nobody
   cares for him. The present age is one that delights in
   Utopias--dangerous toys with which it is only too ready to play. This
   idea is not Utopian, but can be realised. Upon its realisation, and the
   consequent triumph over indolence, avarice, and selfish love of ease,
   depends, not indeed the actual existence of our Church--for it has many
   supports, and might possibly hold out for a very long time--but at all
   events the existence of a really evangelical Christianity, and the
   claim of our Church to appeal to the hearts of the people.

   At the same time, our opponents are right in saying that the formation
   of such congregations is a task demanding time, and that the present
   conditions of public life necessitate action of another and more
   immediate kind. Can and should the Church--I am referring to the
   organised Church--do anything more than preach the Gospel, and revive
   congregational life? This is a most important question, and we have to
   answer it. Some--and the majority --reply most decidedly in the
   negative, and they explain their reason for doing so in very different
   ways. Others answer it in the affirmative, but generally not without
   qualification; or else they evade it by the reply that, whatever the
   Church may do or leave undone, individual Christians are bound to carry
   the Gospel into public life and bring it to bear upon current
   conditions.

   We need not here discuss the duties of individuals, but there seems to
   me to be no question that since our Church still holds a great and
   influential place in the State, and in the life of the nation, it is
   bound to make use of this position for the advancement of evangelical
   social ideals, and accordingly to seek the most opportune ways of
   making its voice heard. Otherwise it will always be suspected of being
   merely an accommodating tool in the hands of an "Aristocratic
   Government," and will incur the blame of allowing an ever-widening
   breach to divide Christian ideals from the social ordinances of public
   life. Even in the days when it was numerically weak, the early Church
   raised its voice against abuses in the State. We saw that the Church of
   the Empire, as it became after the reign of Constantine, was faithful
   to its obligations, and exerted its influence to bring about the
   suppression of moral evils. In the Middle Ages, too, the Popes opposed
   tyranny and violence, as well as open immorality, and they do not to
   this day forego their claim to pronounce judgment upon important
   ethical and social questions. It is, indeed, on this very point, that
   the difference is so marked between Roman Catholicism and
   Protestantism. To the former the "Church" means simply the hierarchical
   institution, with which, consequently, all responsibility rests,
   whereas, according to Protestantism, the spirit of Christianity is not
   confined to any organised ecclesiastical body, but is to be found also
   in the mundane pursuits and ordinances of Christendom. Therefore
   Protestants believe that if the Government or other secular authority
   exercises its power rightly, it will be at one with the ethical ideals
   of Christianity, and accordingly, the ordering of temporal affairs may
   safely be left in its hands. But this in no way debars the Church from
   raising its voice in protest against moral and social evils, and from
   influencing both public opinion and the conduct of matters of national
   interest. It becomes, indeed, its duty so to do, if the State shows
   itself negligent or callous. Within the last thirty years our churches
   have become better able to express their opinions. But to what purpose
   have they this voice--in congregational representation, district,
   provincial and general synods, ecclesiastical courts and high
   consistories--if not to testify in the parish, in the city, in the
   province, in the whole country, on questions of moral and social
   welfare, and to declare: "This is right; that is wrong"? Are they to
   deal only with church rates, church formularies, and unimportant
   details? This may satisfy people for a time, but in the long run it
   will prove intolerable, and must soon excite feelings of pity or worse
   towards the organisation of the Church as a whole; for its vast
   apparatus has a right to exist only if it renders real service to the
   whole body--not by words, but by evangelical-social work, work in which
   every order must perform its own share.

   But the more stress is laid upon this, the more need there is to define
   the limits within which the Church must confine its activity--bounds
   that do not include economic questions. It has nothing to do with such
   practical questions of social-economics as the nationalisation of
   private property arid enterprise, land-tenure reforms, restriction of
   the legal hours of work, price-regulations, taxation, and insurance;
   for in order to settle these matters, such technical knowledge is
   required as is altogether outside the province of the Church, and if it
   were to meddle with them at all it would be led into a secularisation
   of the worst description. But it is its duty to interfere in public
   conditions wherever it finds that serious moral evils are being
   tolerated. Can it be right for the Church, as it were, to shrug its
   shoulders and pass prostitution by in silence, as the priest did the
   man who had fallen among thieves? Is it enough to collect money for
   penitentiaries, leaving it to particular Christian associations to
   fight against the evil? Is the Church not bound to set its face against
   duelling? Dare it, again, keep silence when it sees a state of things
   destructive of the sanctity of marriage, and of family life, and devoid
   of the most elementary conditions of morality? Dare it look calmly on
   while the weak are trodden under foot, and none lends a helping hand to
   people in distress? Dare it hear, without rebuking it, language which,
   in the name of Christianity, destroys the peace of the land and sows
   scorn and hatred broadcast? Is it really only a bureaucratic
   institution, or is it not its duty, as an established Church, to
   preserve peace, both civil and international, to draw together rich and
   poor, and to help to break down mischievous class-prejudices? There
   will, it is true, be found plenty to reply that the Church has enough
   to do if it preaches the word of God and administers the sacraments.
   But the same answer was made to the demand that it should undertake
   foreign and home missions. To that suggestion, too, the Church at first
   was deaf, asserting that such an undertaking formed no part of its
   office; but it has since come to see that by not attending to these
   matters it is neglecting its duties. There would at first sight seem to
   be more weight in the objection that the representatives of the Church
   have no power to enforce their decisions on questions such as those I
   have mentioned; and that, owing to the peculiar composition of
   ecclesiastical gatherings, there is a risk of proposals being put
   forward without regard to their practicability, and therefore coming to
   nothing, as well as of meddling and interference in matters with which
   the Church has no concern. Such apprehensions are not unfounded, but
   the anticipation of mistakes in carrying it out is no adequate reason
   for opposing a course of action in itself necessary and good. Church
   assemblies will learn to measure their strength and to recognise their
   field of work only by practice in that work; and the well-defined arid
   special relation in which the German Evangelical Churches stand to the
   State is sufficient guarantee against too ambitious schemes.

   I have so far tried to indicate the social mission of the Church, but,
   besides this, there are many important tasks which Christians cannot
   regard with indifference, although their accomplishment lies outside
   the actual scope of the Church. Purely economic questions must
   admittedly be estimated and decided only from an economic standpoint;
   but there are many which affect vitally the moral conditions of the
   people. Therefore the Church must not obstruct the discussion of such
   questions amongst its members--as, for instance, at these
   Evangelical-Social Congresses--for it is to the interest of the whole
   Church that warmhearted, clear-sighted Christians should so study the
   subject as to be able to distinguish those efforts at reform which are
   full of promise for the future from such as are merely visionary, and
   to point out the nature and extent of their connection with moral
   questions. They should be ready to make sacrifices for social progress
   on sound lines. It cannot, indeed, be denied that the whole history of
   the Church shows that when warm-hearted Christians take up economic
   questions, they tend to favour radical projects. For their demands
   bearing on political economy they are wont to claim the support of the
   Gospel, and they endeavour to construct from it a socialistic
   programme. It must be admitted that we are even now threatened by this
   danger. Even Protestantism is not free from the danger that some day a
   second Arnold of Brescia may appear in its midst, Patarenes again
   arise, and clerical students of political economy attempt, in the name
   of the Gospel, to prescribe to others, as with legal force, the
   attitude which, if they are to retain the name of Christians, they must
   assume towards social questions. There is certainly an element of
   danger in that coquetting with the Social-democratic movement which may
   already be noticed in certain quarters. As long as the leaders and
   journals of that party inculcate a life devoid of religion, of duties,
   of sacrifice and of resignation, what can we have in common with their
   conception of life as a whole? It is, again, a more than questionable
   procedure to prejudge and condemn "the rich" and whole classes of the
   nation, and dream that it will be possible by beginning at the bottom
   to construct by degrees an entirely new Christian commonwealth. As yet,
   indeed, these are only fragmentary and passing indications of what
   might happen in the future. There is as yet no one among us who does
   not believe that only such claims ought to be put before any individual
   in the name of the Gospel as are addressed to his conscience, his free
   choice and his love; and it is still clearly felt that the Gospel is
   concerned with supplying other than temporal needs; but things have
   their own logic, and those who have sown the wind will reap the
   whirlwind.

   This warning is, however, not intended to dissuade either evangelical
   Christians as such, or clergy and theologians generally, from occupying
   themselves with economic and social questions, and forming their own
   opinions upon them. On the contrary, Christianity ought to stand aloof
   from no common experience of life and the world, and it should he open
   to the consideration of all great questions. Thus for centuries its
   connection was of the closest with philosophy, and especially with
   metaphysics, in which all the intellectual life of the time was summed
   up. No one was then an educated Christian who was not also a
   philosopher. In like manner, history and social questions occupy a
   prominent place in the intellectual life of to-day, and those who wish
   to participate in this life cannot afford to neglect them.

   But, above all, it is the want and misery of our fellow countrymen that
   act like a goad, urging us on to study and investigate the construction
   of the social organism, to examine which of its ills are inevitable,
   and which may be remedied by a spirit of self-sacrifice and energy. The
   magnitude and importance of this task make everything else that we have
   to do on and for this earth seem small. How can we as Christians leave
   this work undone, and how, if, through our selfishness, indolence and
   sloth, our position becomes ever more difficult and critical, can we be
   surprised when we find ourselves overwhelmed with radical proposals
   from those who think differently from ourselves?

   A few words in conclusion. The signs of the times seem to point to
   further development of the socialistic principle of State
   administration of public and economic affairs. There are many who hail
   this tendency with unmixed delight, but I cannot number myself
   unreservedly among them. We have certainly reason to rejoice when
   sources of poverty and want are stopped, and misery is obviated. But we
   must not forget that every fresh regulation of this kind acts also as a
   check upon free development, and so compels us to devise new ways and
   means whereby conditions necessary for the training of free and
   independent personalities may be maintained. If it were all to end in
   legalised slavery; if, hemmed in from childhood by coercive measures,
   we were to lose all individual character, what a disaster that would
   be!

   Three great tasks have been committed to our charge, as duties not only
   towards ourselves, but towards future generations. These are the
   defence of the Evangelical Faith, the prevention, as far as in us lies,
   of distress among our fellow men, and the encouragement of education
   and culture. In the heat of economic conflict, and amidst rival schemes
   for allaying it, the last of these is apt to be forgotten; and yet
   moral and economic ruin would follow speedily upon the decline of
   culture. But the successful pursuit of education depends upon certain
   fixed conditions, which cannot be changed in an arbitrary manner, and
   by which, therefore, the nature and scope of all social and economic
   work must in part be determined.

   Education can no more be brought within the bounds of one unbending
   system than Truth, from which it draws its breath, can he reduced to
   one dead level. But the Evangelical Church would be false to its own
   nature were it to renounce its alliance with truth and education, no
   longer making it its aim to train up free and independent Christians.
   This too is a great evangelical social work, and we have good reason to
   attend to it, since powers hostile to education stand in strong array
   against us.

   Evangelical Faith, a heart sensitive to the wants of others, and a mind
   open to truth and the treasures of the intellect--these are the powers
   on which our Church and nation rest. If we are but true to them, we
   shall realise more and more the truth of the promise expressed in your
   brave hymn of faith:

   "Now is there peace unceasing;
   All strife is at an end."

CHAPTER V

  THE PURSUIT OF EDUCATION

   THE Evangelical Social Congress has imposed upon itself the task of
   critically investigating all those great movements of the present day
   which affect moral and social life, whether by acting as a stimulus or
   as a check, whether by constructiveness or reconstructiveness. Its
   purpose is to examine their nature, their worth, and to discover the
   spirit which ought to animate them. There is no doubt that the modern
   pursuit of education is one of the most prominent social features of
   our time. But at no period is it possible for one who wishes to study
   the general conditions of a nation to overlook its educational
   position; he must determine the standard this has reached, the strength
   of the interests bound up with education, and the measure of sacrifice
   made for it. Now in our day these questions are twice as important as
   they were; for the most cursory glance is enough to show how immensely
   the pursuit of education has increased. The contrast is so great
   between the present and the past--even between now and thirty years
   ago--that the pursuit of a wider and deeper education may positively be
   said to be an essential characteristic of the present epoch. My task
   would be well-nigh endless were I to attempt to describe to you all the
   institutions which this pursuit of education has produced, and in which
   it manifests itself everywhere. I shall therefore only remind you of a
   few facts with which you are all familiar.

   Let us take, for example, one of the larger German towns. We shall find
   there many much-frequented public libraries; we shall find, besides
   technical schools, voluntary and compulsory continuation-schools of
   every kind. Lectures in every department of knowledge are delivered to
   every class of audience, and are enlivened and illustrated by
   experiments and pictures of such excellence as to throw light on the
   most obscure points and bring the most distant objects near to people.
   Where there is a university or other adequate means of instruction, we
   hear of special courses being held in connection with it, in which
   particular subjects or the elements of the various sciences--their
   methods as well as their results--are brought within the reach of those
   who have riot had the advantage of an advanced education at school. By
   the universities again holiday- and continuation-courses are organised,
   and by their means those who left the university years ago become
   acquainted with the latest discoveries of science. Then there are
   courses of applied science; classes to promote first aid to the injured
   and care of the sick; instruction in the new code of civil law; series
   of lectures on social and political subjects and on the theory of
   education; discussions, or continuous courses of instruction, on
   fundamental questions of ethics or religion. Not only that, but posters
   call attention to cheap dramatic performances of the masterpieces of
   our poets, or to concerts for the people: Bach and Handel may be heard
   in church, or Beethoven and Wagner in public halls. Not only is there
   free admittance to museums, but provision is made for expert
   explanation of the collections and works of art contained in them. Even
   late in the evening, and right on into the night, there is no pause in
   the work of supplementing and extending the education of those who
   could not obtain thorough schooling in their youth; or of instructing
   aspiring artisans in the underlying principles, the interconnection,
   and the development of their particular trades. Not only elementary
   manuals and school-books, but also the best literary works of every
   civilised nation, are sold at the lowest possible prices; so that any
   one who knows how to go to work can for ten shillings procure a
   valuable library for which, only a generation ago, he would have had to
   pay ten times as much. In the country, too, a new scheme has recently
   been initiated, and professional agriculturists are being sent to give
   instruction in farming, fruit-growing, and other rural occupations. In
   every direction it is clear that that education which in former days
   only fell by chance to the lot of the few, or was the hard-won prize of
   the zealous and self-denying student, is now being systematised and
   made easily accessible to all. Finally, mention must be made of the
   great quantity of educational matter which finds its way into
   practically every house through the Press, either in the form of
   political newspapers or of special journals. Every industry, each
   handicraft, every branch of manufacture, has its own publication. These
   contain detailed information about all improvements in the special line
   of business with which they deal, and they are edited by men who, apart
   from their very exact knowledge of that particular trade, are well
   acquainted with the economic dependence of their industry upon other
   industries, and with the statistics of the produce market and of
   commerce--in short, by men who possess knowledge of a very extensive
   and varied character. The Waiters' Journal, for example, recently came
   in my way, and showed me with what serious purpose and care such a
   paper is conducted, and how much advice and information its readers may
   gain from it.

   But in order to complete our review of the contrast between the
   existing state of affairs and that of a generation ago, we must take
   particular note of certain classes which are now taking a special part
   in the upward movement, though at that time they were scarcely stirred
   by it. I refer to artisans and women. The pursuit of education by these
   two classes is the really distinguishing feature of the present epoch.

   As far as the working classes are concerned, there are many of them who
   put to shame all other social grades. Quite recently it was once more
   authoritatively stated at Hamburg that the splendid courses of lectures
   which have been organised there are mainly attended by the so-called
   "lower classes."

   Our interest and admiration cannot but be aroused by the zeal now shown
   by these "lower classes" or artisans, who are ready to make sacrifices,
   for the sake not only of improving their material condition, but also
   of raising themselves intellectually and taking a part in the
   progressive world of thought. This does not mean that they are free
   from the desire to satisfy as soon as possible some passing need;
   nevertheless it is undoubtedly knowledge itself for which they are
   striving. They have a burning longing, a hunger and thirst for real
   knowledge--for a scientific view of the world. Even if their ideas as
   to what knowledge can achieve are often extravagant and visionary, even
   if they under-estimate to an extraordinary degree the difficulties to
   be surmounted, there is something impressive in their firm belief in
   the efficacy of knowledge, and in its power to bring liberty, there is
   something touching in the light-heartedness with which they set out on
   their pilgrimage to an unknown paradise.

   But a yet greater movement--indeed I might almost say a more
   fundamental and universal movement--is the pursuit of educacation by
   women. We read in history of great nations being suddenly seized with
   the impulse to wander abroad, leaving their homes to migrate to distant
   lands of bluer skies, more fruitful soil, and keener sense of life; and
   this is the sort of phenomenon we are reminded of when we come to
   consider the "Woman's Movement" of the present time. But just as those
   tribal migrations prove, on closer examination, to have been caused,
   not by some vague inexplicable feeling, but by need, as well as by an
   instinctive love of action, so in this case, too, the impulse is due to
   necessity as well as to an urgent longing to get out of the narrow rut,
   and to a consciousness of strength. There is not at the present day a
   single class of women which has not been stirred by this impulse. Those
   who are in narrow pecuniary circumstances, and are obliged to fight for
   their very existence, are by no means the only ones who join the ranks
   of strenuous women; nay, those whose material position is perfectly
   secure enter the lists also, and, from year to year, with every fresh
   influx of girls leaving school, the movement increases, and grows in
   geometrical progression. They want to have a share in all that the
   intellectual development of the present day has to offer; they want to
   train and emancipate their minds, and to be the equals of men as
   regards knowledge, education, independence. It is essentially a
   question of knowledge and of learning, and they demand admittance
   wherever knowledge is imparted, and privileges are conferred upon the
   basis of its acquisition. Jests about an army of "bluestockings" or of
   "Amazons" long ago became out of place, and indeed, are more and more
   rarely heard; for the movement has grown far too powerful for derision,
   and become so closely bound up with the inmost being of womankind that
   it is now rightly spoken of as the "Woman's Movement."

   Before I conclude this brief survey, you must allow me to glance
   cursorily at the attitude of the State towards the whole movement.
   Since in Germany the State has almost, if not altogether, the monopoly
   of instruction and education, it follows that its line of action in
   this matter is of the utmost importance.

   It may be generally affirmed that in most directions the State meets
   the new educational movement with sympathy, wisdom and active help. It
   is due to it that many of the above-mentioned institutions for the
   promotion of learning have been established; it contributes to the
   support of others, having approved of their foundation. It is fitting
   that it should not be too ready to take the initiative, but should
   prefer to leave it to associations, municipal bodies, or private
   individuals to originate and execute new ideas, and so long as it does
   not repress healthy movements, no harm is done when it resists
   ill-considered haste, and, generally speaking, checks rather than urges
   on the pace. In its own special province, that of elementary education,
   it has just introduced an important and most satisfactory improvement.
   The new regulations for the course of instruction at Teachers' Training
   Colleges are excellent and altogether praiseworthy. The two following
   rules in particular now determine the arrangement of the whole
   curriculum: first, that a gradually progressive course should be
   pursued from the lowest to the highest class, so that, in place of
   wearisome and spiritless repetition, and monotonous drill in the same
   task, genuine educational advance may be made; secondly, that in the
   upper grades interest should be aroused in the principal achievements
   of those branches of knowledge with which the teachers are most nearly
   concerned, as well as in the methods and objects of science and
   learning generally. Both these ideas are in accordance with wishes long
   felt by teachers themselves, and it may confidently be expected that
   the banishment of the old routine will lead to the gradual
   disappearance of the abuses which were so closely associated with it,
   and that the new arrangements will produce as great an improvement in
   the elementary schools as in the Training Colleges. The State is also
   determined, in common with those who wish to promote healthy progress,
   that no false or obsolete knowledge shall be imparted, but that the
   idea of duty and right shall be instilled into all citizens; where this
   principle is concerned, elementary schools can and shall make no
   exceptions.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VI

  MEANING AND VALUE OF EDUCATION

   THIS review shows that we are justified in speaking of a modern
   educational movement, and in regarding it as a distinctive feature of
   our age. The real question, however, with which we are concerned is
   that of the ethical and social value of this pursuit of education. But
   before investigating this, it is necessary to form a clear idea of the
   essential meaning of education generally, and of the particular
   character of modern education. We are not now dealing with what is
   called "Civilisation." Education and civilisation are, of course, very
   closely connected; but we are accustomed, and rightly so, to regard
   civilisation as something external, which may be enjoyed even by those
   who are little influenced by real culture. We are here concerned with
   culture.

   There are countless definitions of education, and their multiplicity
   proves how many-sided education is, and from how many aspects it may be
   regarded. If, in the first place, we consider man with reference to his
   innate capacities, education will mean the full development of all his
   latent powers; by education a man will be enabled to become what he
   really is, or rather, what he has it in him to be. In this view, the
   highest aim of education is the complete unfolding of a person's
   individuality, and, as a result of such self-realisation, an attitude
   of freedom towards the external world--a return, as it were, to such
   freedom and simplicity as is the surest token of a self-determined
   personality:

   "He stands undaunted at the helm:
   The ship is tossed by wind and waves,
   But wind and waves shake not his heart."

   If, in the next place, we consider man in his relations towards that
   Nature of which he is a part, education will be seen to have a two-fold
   function to perform. On the one hand, it will be a weapon of defence
   against Nature, a protection against her threat of overwhelming force;
   so far as possible, it will master Nature, gaining possession of her
   secrets by cunning and skill, in order to subjugate her and make her a
   willing servant. On the other hand, it is the office of education to
   lead, by knowledge of Nature, to reconciliation with her; to disclose
   the intimate connection between all things that have life; and to knit
   yet closer every healthy bond by which they are already connected. From
   this standpoint, again, the. highest aim in view is power and liberty.

   If, again, we consider man in the light of history, and as a member of
   the human race, then education will be that which renders a man capable
   of gathering up with sympathetic understanding all that is human, and
   of reflecting it again in his own person, which keeps him open-hearted
   and open-minded, giving him the key to the innermost soul of others,
   and which makes his intellect and his emotions delicately responsive
   organs, able to see and hear in regions where the senses are of no
   avail. Through education he will feel himself at home in many places,
   and yet will shut himself up in none; he will learn how to shape his
   own life steadfastly and worthily amidst change and instability, how to
   make it dignified amidst monotony and triviality, how to gain
   self-control and patience in face of human littleness, and how to
   maintain an attitude of reverence towards all that is human and divine.

   Lastly, if we think of education in the narrowest sense, in its bearing
   on the special calling of each individual, then it may be defined as
   the sum of all that knowledge and skill which are necessary if the
   duties of our calling are to be discharged with thoroughness, freedom,
   and ease. Thus in this case, again, freedom is the final result: it is
   built up in the exercise of one's profession, and is the reward of
   those who, instead of being weighed down by the burden of their daily
   work, so use their knowledge and power that the exercise of them
   becomes second nature. This education in the narrower sense of the
   word, technical or professional education, must never be underrated;
   particular training is the normal starting-point for general education,
   and without the former the latter is difficult, if not impossible, to
   attain.

   Some among you have very likely smiled at my enthusiastic panegyric on
   education, or have even felt annoyed. You have thought of the kind of
   man dubbed "educational pedant," and of all that has been justly said
   about him. But those who believe in education as I have tried to define
   it, will be among the strongest opponents of such sham educationists.
   For the pedant is to the educated man what Wagner is to "Faust," or
   what a lay figure is to a living one--a thing that has no life save in
   its own conceit! The pedant is devoid alike of toleration and of
   patience, of freedom and of reverence, of personality and of love; the
   fruits of knowledge all vanish in his hand, and he holds but husks,
   which he takes to be the inmost essence of real things.

   But, besides these, there have appeared from time to time genuine and
   serious anti-educationists--no ignorant barbarians, but educated men,
   who yet oppose education. The attitude is obviously paradoxical, and
   such that the fallacy might almost be left to perish through its own
   inconsistency. There have been, and, indeed, still are, highly-educated
   Romanticists who, having failed to reap all the benefits they had
   expected to receive from great culture, turn and abuse education,
   contrasting it unfavourably with Nature, or Life, or something else
   utterly indefinable. That is no new thing; the eighteenth century had
   its Rousseau, and we have still our petty but not uninfluential
   Rousseaus. When they are not opposing education in order to commend a
   life of impulse, or in order to shake themselves free from all concern
   for their fellow men, and from all responsibility for the course of
   human affairs, what they attack is not really education as such, but a
   false, narrow, corrupt view of education. This was notably the case
   with Rousseau; therefore our thanks are due to him, and on many points
   we are at one with him. But we cannot acquiesce when he simply extols
   Nature at the expense of Education. If there is here no delusory
   playing with words, and if no extraneous idea is imported into the term
   Nature, we cannot subscribe to his formula, "Back to Nature." We ought
   certainly to be sincere, unaffected, without hypocrisy, and we ought
   not to let ourselves be captivated by anything that is at variance with
   our truest being; but Nature cannot be our teacher on all points, for
   she lacks two elements which to us are absolutely indispensable, that
   is to say, self-determining personality and goodness. These are not to
   be learned from Nature, but are found only in life as revealed in
   history.

   But finally, there are yet others--and that among the ranks of our
   friends--in whom unqualified praise of education arouses mistrust.
   There are earnest Christians who warn us against esteeming education
   too highly, and insist at the same time that it can never be of more
   than limited value. Their position is easy to understand, for, in the
   first place, in all that concerns the higher life, a sure and confident
   knowledge of one's aim and ideal is of such paramount importance that
   it can compensate for many shortcomings, so that a truly religious man
   will always be an educated man, though he may happen to possess little
   "culture." In the second place, education of any reality and depth can
   only be the outcome of painful conflict and hard struggle; toil and
   effort are required to win it and to guard it. Now, since this truth is
   often forgotten by superficial thinkers, who confuse education with
   mere erudition; and since they further overlook the fact that education
   matures but slowly, and involves a lengthy process of gradual growth,
   or of being educated, with many successive stages, the suspicion with
   which some earnest people regard our watchword "Education" is well
   justified. But education itself is not to blame for the superficial and
   inadequate ideas current about it; therefore every word uttered against
   it should be carefully weighed. Moreover, it is hardly wise to pass
   disparaging judgments on education, because religion confers such great
   blessings. Certainly the want of education is least felt where there is
   a genuine religious life, so complete in itself as to be capable of
   transfiguring the whole personality. But if an individual possesses
   this inner light, and has little education, he is restricted in his
   outer activities by very definite limitations; while certain specific
   vocations may be open to him, he is excluded from most, and he must
   leave to others the work of improving and preserving this world of
   ours. The fact remains, then, that the only opponents of education are
   those who are ignorant of its nature, or, at least, mistaken with
   regard to it--while those who declaim against it usually find
   themselves in the curiously inconsistent position of thinking in its
   terms and speaking its language. And even though it may be true that
   wherever education is decried, we have an indication that there is
   something unsound or corrupt in the prevailing educational movement, it
   is utter folly or audacity to wage war against education as such, or to
   represent it as a matter of no importance. To combat education by any
   means, or in any kind of utterance, witty or otherwise, with the object
   of making it appear contemptible or superfluous in the eyes of the
   people, is to incur the heavy responsibility of confusing and outraging
   all sound beliefs. From this point of view I regard as very
   questionable the influence of even Tolstoi's writings, and can only
   find sorry consolation in the thought that most of his readers remain
   unaffected by them, except to the extent of feeling a passing emotion.
   On the whole, indeed, we may venture to predict that neither these nor
   any other attempts at repression can check that mighty, urgent impulse
   towards education which is working in our midst. The movement is
   stronger and more full of life than ever before; and naturally so,
   since it is only in our days that the whole world has for the first
   time become as it were one single arena. Modern facilities of
   communication have broken down all barriers, and at the present day
   countless kaleidoscopic impressions assail our senses on every side.
   The light of publicity flashes upon everything; nothing is hid from the
   eyes of the world. Competition, in every sense of the word, is the
   ruling principle everywhere, and in any one question endless others are
   involved. An uneducated man is utterly helpless in face of such a state
   of affairs, and there will soon be no quiet corner left, in which he
   may take refuge. His only arm of defence is education, and in this fact
   lies the prime cause of the educational movement of to-day.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VII

  MAIN FEATURES OF MODERN EDUCATION

   LET us now consider the principal direction in which this educational
   movement manifests itself; for although all education is fundamentally
   one, from time to time various aspects come to the fore and
   preponderate. In my opinion, the following stand out clearly as the
   principal features in our present pursuit of education. First, it shows
   a hearty preference for such knowledge as is intrinsically real;
   secondly, its most serious aim is to gain independence, economic and
   personal; and thirdly, it reveals a longing for a keener sense of life
   and a desire to obtain a fuller share in life, in one's relations both
   to the outer world and to the inner self.

   I have said that the new educational movement discloses, in the first
   place, a strong preference for real knowledge, or, as it might with
   equal truth be expressed, for a knowledge of the real. To provide this
   is the object of most of the above-mentioned institutions and
   enterprises. It is a pleasure to genuine scholars to observe the
   unfeigned eagerness and zeal with which the pursuit of scientific
   knowledge is carried on to-day. Fine words and interesting tales no
   longer suffice; men want to know the world of reality, and to study the
   progress made by knowledge; that is why single lectures on popular
   science are being abandoned more and more in favour of consecutive
   courses of instruction. There is increased interest in the history of
   the discovery and recognition of reality and truth; or, at any rate, an
   earnest desire to see facts as they are, and to guard against deceptive
   appearances. But the most notable point of all is the manner in which
   the two leading ideas of modern science have spread in all directions,
   and have already become the test by which to measure the validity of
   knowledge generally--the theory, that is, of the conservation and
   transmutation of energy, and the doctrine of evolution. We rejoice that
   this is the case, and it is a mistake to imagine that it is a step
   which can ever be retraced. The perception that every special form of
   energy is an integrant part of a general system, in and through which
   alone it exists, and that any individual phenomenon possesses reality
   only as a link in an evolutionary series, is such a revelation as, once
   perceived, can never again be lost sight of; for through it we are
   enabled to discern and to comprehend as much of the world around us as
   it is given to us to know. In this sense the characteristic of our
   times may justly be said to be the pursuit of realism, and the
   description is one that we can use gladly, not reproachfully. We
   rejoice to live in an age in which, in spite of ever-abundant stupidity
   and superstition, there is such an overpowering impulse towards
   reality. Honesty and sincerity are at the bottom of it--honest work and
   sincere endeavour--and I do not hesitate to ascribe to this tendency a
   high ethical significance. We shall duly examine its limitations, but
   at any rate those who strive with a single mind to gain a knowledge of
   the real are, in so doing, showing moral activity, and those who, for
   the same object, make sacrifice of strength and of means, are making
   these sacrifices for a moral end.

   We saw, in the second place, that this educational movement reveals a
   fixed intention to gain, by means of education, an independence, both
   general and economic. What is it that urges crowds of workmen, full of
   zeal for education, to devote their scanty leisure to technical
   training and to the further cultivation of their minds? Not merely the
   yearning for knowledge as such, but also the keen desire to improve
   their condition, and to win for themselves a more secure position in
   the labour market by means of increased intelligence and skill. What,
   again, is one of the principal causes of the great Woman's movement, to
   which I have alluded? Here, too, it is the desire for independence, the
   wish of each one to be self-supporting, and, by means of a fixed
   occupation, to win for herself a definite and secure place in the
   world. This is an altogether praiseworthy aim, and may indeed be
   regarded as an ethical tendency in the strictest sense of the word. A
   human being, man or woman alike, who has no vocation and no definite
   sphere is a useless person. One's calling is the backbone of one's
   life, and that which lends it stability; without a settled sphere of
   duty arid the consciousness of filling a place where one is really
   required, no life can be healthy. Now, since there are very many girls
   to whose lot matrimony will never fall, and since domestic work has
   diminished enormously in quantity as compared with former days, it
   follows that women must seek for other vocations, and be admitted to
   them. Nay, one must go further yet, and agree with those who say that
   no girl ought to be brought up with a view to marriage only, and solely
   as a future helpmeet for man, but ought rather to be so educated as to
   be qualified for the duties of some suitable calling. This is a
   perfectly just demand, not only because the eventuality of marriage is
   always uncertain, not only because of the importance of improving the
   pitiable position of countless widows, whose poverty and dependence
   were formerly regarded as their inevitable destiny, but also because
   the stage of development we have reached requires that every normal
   citizen should be able to fend for him or herself, and should look upon
   independence as both a duty and a right. In other times these matters
   were regarded differently, but a new epoch has arisen--an epoch to
   which we are proud to belong. Further results that may be looked for
   from this dawning movement of reform are the raising of the moral
   standard of the female sex where this is required, and an ethical
   improvement in the relations of the two sexes towards each other. It is
   true that the movement is not free from its own new and peculiar
   dangers, of which we must speak later; nothing human is without its
   darker side; but there can scarcely be any doubt that some of the
   blackest shadows which disfigure the whole circumstances and lot of
   women can be swept away, or at any rate lessened, by the growth of
   economic independence among them. It is impossible, for example, that
   prostitution, either in its coarser or more refined form, should
   continue to its present extent if the education of women is made to
   include preparation for definite callings. Then this new order of
   affairs must necessarily re-act upon men also, and on this point I
   heartily agree with Mr. Wychgram, one of the most ardent promoters of
   the woman's movement, who writes as follows in the opening article of
   his new periodical, "Women's Education": "The furtherance of women's
   education will, if it is conducted on sound principles and by right
   means, prove a blessing both to women themselves and to society
   generally. For there are two chief considerations: by better training
   of the feminine intellect we are, in the first place, raising the
   general position of the sex; and, by doing this, we believe that we
   are, in the second place, enriching our whole life of culture, by
   importing into it a new, valuable and reproductive element. To
   womankind we are giving a higher and nobler independence--a word that
   can and must be understood in a double sense, ethical and economic. It
   is true in an ethical sense, because, whatever may be said to the
   contrary, it is the highest possible development of his mental powers
   that best fits the man of to-day to take a serious view of life and its
   duties, and because, in the case of every thoughtful nature, such a
   grasp of life becomes in turn an inexhaustible source of happiness. In
   the economic sense, independence raises us above that sad plight in
   which we are obliged to live by other's toil, and are unable ourselves
   to produce any work of value to others. This touches upon questions of
   the deepest import, and if no thinking man can doubt that happiness
   consists in work--rightly undertaken, executed, and remunerated--then
   we must enable women to perform such work."

   We observed, in the third place, that there is manifested in this
   movement a yearning for a greater sense of life, and for a fuller share
   in life in all its relations. But this is a matter by no means easy to
   understand aright. It is not a craving for mere pleasure that I mean,
   although that, too, might to some extent be justified, and it is very
   easy for those to scorn it who can easily procure for themselves
   hundreds of pleasures unattainable by the objects of their righteous
   indignation. Nor do I mean the latest romantic fancy for frenzied and
   artificial excitement of the senses; such a practice is the very
   opposite of true education, and absolutely inimical to it. What I do
   mean is the endeavour to escape from the dull monotony which is all
   that life itself still offers to thousands, and to enrich and
   invigorate existence by widening the range. This purpose has now become
   a mighty force, animating many who feel that the mere alternation of
   night and day is not sufficient to keep a man's faculties healthy, but
   that he further requires change during the day, and that he can only
   remain vigorous and alert if he can look beyond his immediate
   occupation, and share in the general happiness of humanity. But if this
   wider life of his is to extend beyond the crudest pleasures, he cannot
   dispense with a certain amount of progressive education, and that which
   will bind him to others who have similar aims, for in this matter none
   ever attains his end in isolation. This truth is felt by the aspirants
   themselves, for it is by no mere chance or coincidence that the
   movements for social and educational reform work together hand in hand
   to bring about the enrichment of life. From the ethical and Christian
   point of view it is impossible to find fault with this struggle, for in
   view of the fact that every life is considered to have an eternal
   significance, the end of life is Life itself.

   I have tried to indicate the most important and distinctive features of
   the educational movement of the present day. In the process its ethical
   and social value have revealed themselves in every direction, without
   being in any way obtruded by me, and apart from any mention of
   particular effects. And indeed, numerous as these are, it is not in
   them that the prime import of the movement consists. I may, for
   example, point out the beneficial effect that improved education will
   have upon the question of the housing of the poor--that most urgent
   problem of social life. Since we may reasonably regard the condition of
   the home as a fairly exact measure of the education of those who live
   in it, and since we everywhere observe that higher education leads to a
   demand for better dwellings, it is obvious that in this point domestic
   circumstances are affected by an intellectual impulse, and that this
   can easily be proved. I may also call attention to the fact that higher
   education tends to promote social equality, and that by it the
   different ranks and classes of a nation are drawn together, and learn
   to understand and sympathise with each other. In this connection
   University Extension lectures are of special value, and it is easy to
   perceive that underlying all such undertakings is a strong social
   element, namely, that mutual recognition that makes for unity between
   the classes. And lastly, I may observe, that educated men are, as a
   rule, prudent and thoughtful; therefore extreme and eccentric opinions
   will give way to a growing sense of the necessary limitations imposed
   by circumstances, and this again will tend to the establishment of
   social peace. But, as I said before, any particular effects must only
   be regarded as parts of the general result, which consists in helping
   the individual by means of higher education to become a real
   personality, and so to increase his social value also. We cannot see
   the goal that awaits a nation united in peaceful work, in mutual
   recognition and in solicitude of class for class, nor the final outcome
   of a "universal ethical alliance," in which "all men bind themselves in
   one, with all their strength, with heart and soul, intellect and
   affection;" for these, like all ideals, lie beyond our vision. But this
   at least is certain, that we are not turning our backs upon them, but
   are in the right way to attain them, if we promote the educational
   movement in every direction, and, in the midst of our anxiety for
   economic reform, never cease to look for the ideal, which is after all
   the most truly real.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER VIII

  DANGERS OF MODERN EDUCATION

   AT the same time we should be guilty of thoughtlessness and of
   dangerous superficiality if we were content with merely emphasising the
   great value of the educational movement of the present day from the
   ethical and social standpoint, and with urging that for this reason it
   must be encouraged and made use of in every possible way. Rather it is
   our duty to examine the objections which have been raised against it,
   and to recognise the special dangers attaching to it; by so doing we
   shall gain a clearer apprehension of its moral and social significance.

   The first danger we have to encounter seems to be that of
   half-education. Not only "reactionaries," but even men who are anxious
   for social improvement and in favour of healthy progress, are among
   those who view with suspicion the present educational movement, and the
   institutions founded in connection with it. To these we readily confess
   that the special dangers of half-education--vagueness, confusion,
   ridiculous conceit, and discontent--cannot immediately be removed, and
   may, indeed, in existing circumstances, increase for a time among a
   certain section. But to oppose the present educational movement and try
   to repress it on that account, would be the most perverse course of
   action possible. We cannot repress it, for it is far too strong; we
   should only force it back in the direction of bad teaching and poor
   methods of instruction. One cannot hope to combat the dangers of
   half-education by condemning people to no education at all, but only by
   providing them with thorough education. The best men must offer
   themselves for the work, and the best books must be written to
   facilitate it. While showing to students the most important results of
   the sciences, it is essential at the same time to arouse in them an
   interest in scientific methods, and a sense of the enormous difficulty
   of attaining to positive knowledge in any department. This
   accomplished--and it can be done--the main point is achieved, and the
   greatest risk of half-education is averted. Certainly, none can soar
   aloft to the highest stage of scientific knowledge, nor is there any
   royal road to learning; great thinkers will stand by themselves to the
   end of time, and there will always be a kind of knowledge beyond the
   reach of the general public. But there are grades of knowledge as of
   education, and it is not true that clear and bracing air can be
   breathed only on the highest peak of the mountain. The bad associations
   of the words "popular science"--once almost equivalent to
   "pseudo-science"--need not always cling to them; indeed, I think they
   have to some extent vanished. When half-truths and trivialities are
   excluded, when reverence is awakened for truth itself and the
   investigation of it, and when the particular kind of knowledge set
   before each individual is likely to be of real use to him in his daily
   life, popular science is indeed good and true science.

   This last condition brings us face to face with a second danger in the
   present educational movement--that of indiscriminate levelling. This
   peril appears to me to be very great, and most pernicious in its
   effects; it is, indeed, one of the principal causes of half-education
   at its worst, and would necessarily in the long run prove destructive
   of all real knowledge. In every single direction its results are fatal;
   its influence is anti-social, inasmuch as it destroys the firm
   foundations of society and interferes with the free development of
   original and independent natures. By "levelling," I mean the endeavour
   to impose upon, or at least to prescribe for, all alike an exactly
   identical education, and as far as possible a precisely similar course
   of training, regardless of the distinctions of sex, individuality, or
   vocation. The consequences of such an attempt may be seen in the
   downfall of ancient schools of learning, but even we ourselves have
   seen something of these bad results, and shall have to buy our
   experience more dearly yet. It is easy enough to understand that, with
   the removal of various external barriers, the simplest plan might seem
   to be to enforce upon all and sundry one dead level of uniformity. But
   this is a notion based upon the most superficial and fatal idea of
   education--as if it were something that could be bestowed upon people
   like an object altogether outside of themselves, whereas in reality its
   possibility depends upon its association with the natural
   characteristics and special vocation of every individual. Apart from
   these it is mere surface lacquer--the nasty, sticky, shiny stuff that
   varnish is--or rather, it is something much worse, a poison, capable of
   destroying vigour and health of mind and soul, and very often of body
   too. In this respect, I cannot acquit the modern woman's movement of
   grave errors in various directions, although it is but just to begin by
   mentioning certain excuses for them. Such are the hard struggle for
   daily bread and for bare existence, the laudable ambition to gain
   economic independence; and further, the lack of thorough
   qualifications, which hampers women's work; and the competition with
   male labour, which is too often forced upon them at the present day. I
   recognise the force of these excuses, but I can only regard as a
   grievous mistake the widespread theory that, because woman is the equal
   of man as regards human value, it straightway follows that the same
   course of instruction and the same occupations should be thrown open to
   her as to man. In some quarters there is even an affectation of
   treating the question of sex, in its bearing on work and civil standing
   generally, as altogether archaic and irrelevant; and where this leads,
   as it sometimes does, to an attack upon marriage itself, it is nothing
   short of social disintegration that we are threatened with. I retract
   nothing of all I have already urged in justification of the woman's
   movement; but I do not admit the conclusion that women's education must
   be modelled exactly on the lines selected for the education of men, or
   that society is in a healthy state when women are competing with men in
   every sphere of action. Equality does not imply absolute parity, and
   woman would still not be inferior to man, even if it should be proved
   that her intellectual average is lower than his. To the eyes of all but
   the wilfully blind, it has, in any case, long ago been clear that
   physically woman is less fitted than man for a number of occupations.
   The difficult task that lies before us is to determine what professions
   are suitable for women, and to see that these are undertaken only under
   such conditions as are adapted to the mental and physical organisation
   of the sex. This task is but newly commenced, and until it is
   accomplished, there will be constant sacrifice of valuable human lives.
   In the meantime all care must be taken to avoid any levelling process,
   the injurious effects of which have already been exposed. Furthermore,
   although women must certainly not be brought up with a view solely to
   marriage and the care of a family, that must still be the primary aim
   of their education. If it is objected that, in the case of men,
   preparation for domestic life is not the first consideration, the
   objection indicates at the outset a radically false view of the whole
   matter. This becomes yet more apparent when we find the old question of
   the Middle Ages being dis-cussed once more, as to whether matrimony is
   in any case an estate worthy of a free personality. It is not only by
   frivolous pleasure-seekers that this question is raised, although the
   convictions of those who argue it are very far removed from those
   which, in former days, resulted in monasticism. But all such
   controversies appear to me to be merely symptoms of a temper both
   anti-social and opposed to the teaching of the Gospel, and I find in
   them the very disagreeable expression of a selfishness which is none
   the more creditable because it seeks to ally itself with the pursuit of
   education. Although there is unfortunately a whole literature on the
   subject already--a so-called "polite literature"--I purposely pass over
   in silence these impious attempts to undermine the foundations of
   society in this respect, and to throw open contempt upon marriage as an
   institution.

   It is, however, not only in certain developments of the woman's
   movement and of the sex-problem that this tendency to unlimited and
   dangerous levelling appears; it may be observed in other directions
   also. As a clear expression of the opposite aim, by which we ought
   rather to be inspired, I will quote a piece of character-drawing from a
   wonderful speech by Mommsen on the Emperor William I. He says: "The
   Emperor William was, as all true men should be, a man with a
   profession. He completely mastered the duties belonging to it, and, as
   his high calling as a soldier demanded, he spent his life in the theory
   and practice of military science. There are not many who have as
   seriously devoted the years of youth and manhood alike to the art of
   war as he did. Consequently he was amateurish in nothing. He delighted
   in beauty, and was wont to follow with enjoyment the discussion of
   learned questions." This shows us the element that must be introduced,
   if we are to counteract excessive uniformity. Special training, with a
   view to individual vocation, must be offered in the first place, and
   must become both the starting- and connecting-point for all further
   advance in knowledge, which must henceforth grow round this in
   concentric, but ever-widening circles. Such a method both avoids the
   dilettanteism resulting from attempts at absolute uniformity, and at
   the same time succeeds in producing that true veneration for knowledge,
   which tends more than anything to open the minds of those who possess
   it, and to make people more modest.

   But there is yet a third danger that must be faced; it arises from the
   special character of the modern educational movement, with its eager
   endeavour to attain knowledge of the real--an aspiration which may be
   productive of the greatest good, but unless it is combined with strict
   moral training, will do harm. Goethe once said of one of his friends
   that his ability and learning were greater than his strength of
   character was able to bear; and in another connection we find the
   profound saying: "Everything that sets free our intelligence without
   giving us self-control, is fatal." That is a terse and striking epitome
   of the matter; but it is a heavy task that devolves upon educationists.
   We have to learn that, with all our excellent institutions for the
   spread of learning and knowledge, we have only accomplished half--nay,
   not half--of our mission. If we are unable to influence the morals of
   those whom we are instructing, it is a dangerous work that we are
   carrying on. All earnest search after truth and pursuit of knowledge
   does indeed include a high moral element, but this requires to be
   brought to the light, and explicitly shown to the learners. Above all,
   the personality of the teacher must be so armed with the moral force of
   truth as to be able to exhibit it and impress it upon others; in every
   kind of teaching--in the higher grades no less than in the lower--the
   personality of the teacher is of pre-eminent importance. We can learn
   all sorts of things from books and by other impersonal means through
   which knowledge is transmitted, but we can be educated only by
   educators--by personalities, whose own force and life make a deep
   impression upon us. But who can deny that in this respect the work of
   education at the present time leaves much to be desired? The pursuit of
   knowledge so eagerly carried on among us now calls for a type of
   personality full of hope, love, faith, moral power, more mature and
   possessing a deeper sense of life than ever before. It calls for a
   personality which will enable every pupil to see that all true
   education--or formation of character--is transformation, painful in
   process, but resulting in freedom; something old must perish, something
   new must come into being and wax strong!

   Very closely connected with this is another point which goes to the
   root of the matter: all true education starts from a complete and
   definite theory of existence, and it is only valuable in so far as it
   enables men to see life steadily and see it whole. Yet such a
   comprehensive view of the world cannot be other than idealistic; that
   is to say, it must be rooted in the conviction that personal life and
   moral consciousness are worth more and rank higher than any mere life
   of nature, and that, as it is in God that we live and move and have our
   being, we are accountable to Him. But are the intellectual leaders of
   our nation of the present day animated by such a conception of the
   universe--that is to say, by a faith that is sure of itself? Who dare
   affirm it? Since the Enlightenment movement came to an end at the
   beginning of the nineteenth century, we have had no one consistent,
   elevating, and ennobling theory of life. Neither the subsequent revival
   of religious belief nor the great idealistic systems of philosophy have
   succeeded in giving our people such an outlook on the world. This state
   of affairs, which has lasted so long already, this lack of faith and
   diversity of beliefs, is most prejudicial to all healthy progress
   to-day; it is the cause of our weakness in every direction, including
   our ineffectiveness in face of the political and ecclesiastical system
   of Roman Catholicism. We have practically prevailed against materialism
   as a philosophy; we may liken it to a disease that time and the healing
   influence of nature have cured; but we are very far from being really
   sound yet, for such a cure does not produce positive health. It was no
   theologian, but an opponent of theology, the philosopher John Stuart
   Mill, who, in his autobiography, wrote as follows: "When the
   philosophic minds of the world can no longer believe its religion, or
   can only believe it with modifications amounting to an essential change
   of its character, a transitional period commences, of weak convictions,
   paralysed intellects, and growing laxity of principle, which cannot
   terminate until a renovation has been effected in the basis of their
   belief, leading to the evolution of some faith, whether religious or
   merely human, which they can really believe: and when things are in
   this state, all thinking or writing which does not tend to promote such
   a renovation, is of very little value beyond the moment." If we omit
   the expression "merely human faith," which to me is meaningless in
   contra-distinction to religious faith, Mill's is a most accurate
   description of the present situation, and of what must necessarily
   ensue. It is useless to expect that the mere study of particular
   sciences can avert it; for in this matter neither specialised learning,
   nor knowledge as a whole, can avail anything. Men must be exhorted to
   retire into their own souls, in order that, while immense realities
   throng upon them through their acquaintance with the sciences, they may
   not overlook or forget the real nature of Reality itself. They
   themselves, in the first instance, are this Reality--their souls, that
   existence of theirs which is lifted above nature. This, to be sure, is
   a matter, not of knowledge, but of faith, since it can be present in
   the mind only as a struggling and growing conviction; yet it is the
   motive power of all mental, and ultimately of all social life. "It is
   characteristic of belief to impel to action; it is characteristic of
   unbelief to destroy the joy of work, to deny to man his creative
   destiny, and so to force him back upon bare existence and primitive
   instinct, till humanity, grown tired of the attempt to spiritualise
   existence, wearies at last of life itself." Now modern science has
   necessarily adopted the genetic method, which consists in going back
   everywhere to first beginnings, and in tracing things to their original
   elements, and to the lowest forms from which they appear to have
   sprung; and this does, indeed, tend to cause great confusion in weak
   and unstable minds, and to confirm any inclination they may already
   have to underestimate their own human value. It is not a state of
   affairs that is bound to last for ever; the time must come when it will
   be recognised that the gradual development of truth results, like
   consecutive acts of creation, in bringing to light new marvels of great
   and valuable power; but in the meantime we are called upon to put forth
   all our strength to cope with the situation. As far as it is in our
   power to influence the course of events, we must never encourage the
   dissemination of knowledge or spread of education, unless at the same
   time the moral consciousness of those who are taught is invigorated,
   the inner harmony of their personalities strengthened, and the eternal
   significance of their lives enriched. This must be our constant aim,
   but especially with regard to instruction in social history and social
   questions. Of all current phrases, none is more open to objection than
   the saying that social life must be regarded in the light mainly, if
   not altogether, of economics, and economics be considered by itself,
   and absolutely apart from anything else. Such a dictum is objectionable
   in the first place because it is false; but it is also regrettable
   because it lends support to blind and petty prejudices, and hinders
   ethical progress. Those who give utterance to it in good faith,
   imagining that such a view will simplify matters and win for them more
   ready hearing, do not know what they are doing; and fortunately they
   are refuted by their own practice. At the bottom of all great social
   questions and all intellectual problems, seekers after truth will
   always light upon the moral and--closely bound up with it--religious
   element; these can never be neglected without doing injury both to
   facts as they really are. and to mankind. But it is no use for us to
   try to idealise that universe presented to us by a knowledge of the
   external world and embellish it with all kinds of aesthetic notions:
   quick eyes will see through I the device, and we shall not thus attain
   our object. Nothing can satisfy, on the one hand, the sense of the
   individual value of the human soul, and the requirements of its inner
   life; and on the other, the ideal set before us of the universal
   brotherhood of mankind, except the Christian idea of God--"God is the
   Lord, and He is love." As we were created by Him and for Him, so too
   our knowledge and education must be rooted and grounded in Him. This
   feeling lifts us above the region of the transitory into that of the
   everlasting and eternal; it ennobles the meanest work, and cancels all
   mere surface value. In this spirit, then, we must work and educate.

   Every member of this Congress is equally persuaded of the truth I have
   just enunciated, and is convinced that, as beseems Protestants, it is
   our duty to fulfil this task in enlightened agreement with the
   traditions of our Evangelical Church. But how much there is to do, and
   how lacking we are in zeal, assiduity, and persistent effort! The
   educational movement of to-day has laid open to us an immense field of
   action, and none can excuse himself by saying that he does not wish to
   waste his time sowing on the stony ground or among thorns. There is a
   general readiness to hear, to learn, to exchange ideas, and to ponder
   new conceptions. There is keen and living interest in the deepest
   questions which concern human life, as well as in social
   problems--issues which are most intimately connected, and are, indeed,
   fundamentally one. The responsibility would be ours if this modern
   pursuit of education were to end in despair, either because men were
   not given the bread of life they ask, or because that offered them had
   ceased to be life-giving; it would be our fault if it were to result in
   disgust and scepticism, and in the conclusion that reality is barren,
   and knowledge fruitless. That must never he. May to-day's Congress help
   to intensify our feeling of responsibility towards our people, and to
   increase our strength!

   All discoveries--nay, all knowledge, for the time being so exciting in
   its novelty--soon become cheap and insignificant; but all the same it
   has eternal life in it, if it gives depth and fuller life to the inward
   being, and help in the great work of transformation into a higher self.

CHAPTER IX

  THE SENSE IN WHICH THE GOSPEL BECOMES A REAL POWER

   THE Gospel teaches us that we escape from a barren existence only when
   we are ready to live for others of our own free will. It is then that
   we are made to feel more keenly how miserable and empty is the
   existence of a man intent upon seeking his own. It can, however, be to
   us a Gospel, only if it further actually brings and proclaims to us the
   beginning of a life with power. It must act upon us as a renewing
   force. Yet if it is really to accomplish this it must mean something
   more than a collection of ideas, which it is our duty and desire to
   accept. It is, indeed, certain that if we do not dismiss these ideas,
   but let them in course of time become habitual to us, our resolutions
   may be very powerfully influenced by them, especially by the thought of
   a Father in Heaven, inflexibly stern yet full of infinite goodness and
   mercy. Still, however pregnant the ideas so freely bestowed upon us by
   the messengers of the Gospel, they can never do more than stimulate the
   nature that we have: they cannot transform us.

   Only in so far as we are able to apprehend the truth of doctrines can
   we make them our own. We must understand their purport, and perceive
   that the idea contained is the expression of a reality, revealed to us
   ourselves. When we find a thought expressing something which we have
   been made to feel in such an experience, it becomes in a peculiar sense
   our own. But if, without this, we try to adopt it, we may end by
   quietly changing it, till it suits ourselves; and if we do not even do
   this, our inmost being can have nothing to do with it at all. To say
   that we want to appropriate it can then only mean that, in our
   intercourse with others, we refuse to say anything against it. It
   constantly happens that the ideas of the Gospel are only "appropriated"
   by people in this sense. Many fancy they possess them, to whom they are
   no more than something they refuse to attack, but are unable to
   utilise. And many whose earnest endeavour it is to utilise them, work
   at them continually till they have made them assume such a form as they
   can assimilate. The result is not that they are transformed, but that
   the ideas of the Gospel are altered by their own character. The power
   of the Gospel can never be effectual in its working, while people are
   so insincere as to propose "to appropriate by faith" the ideas
   contained therein.

   The ideas are always so shaped that their truth is obvious to those
   alone who in their inward being experience a great transformation. The
   very conception of God as the Almighty Father is true only when it
   expresses this kind of experience. When the idea is presented as the
   message of the Gospel, it may indeed attract us by promising
   deliverance; but if of the contents of the Gospel we learn nothing
   more, it will soon recall to our minds many of our own experiences
   testifying in the opposite direction. In a world so full of suffering
   no Heavenly Father meets our gaze. Nor can it be in our own hearts that
   the idea originates of the everlasting power of good, as inexhaustible
   goodness towards ourselves; for here the consciousness is present that
   our own nature is altogether in contrast to such goodness. A Gospel, to
   be deserving of the name, must so operate upon us that we may embrace
   as very truth the above conception of God. It must have the power so to
   influence us that the divine character--the capacity freely to live for
   others--begins to take shape in us. Unless this happens, we can have no
   real understanding of the message concerning the Father in Heaven,
   since otherwise we cannot number ourselves among those who are ruled by
   His goodness.

   The Gospel is a message of glad tidings only because, when it really
   reaches a man, it does not present him with mere ideas, but furnishes
   practical proof of the love of God, convincing him of God's infinite
   goodness towards him. Then begins that inward transformation whereby
   our lives may be fashioned according to Gospel ideas. We must detach
   ourselves from what hitherto we have desired for ourselves, and be
   ready to sacrifice it for the community. Otherwise the Gospel has not
   yet given us a foretaste of heaven. If we have no free and God-like
   goodness towards others, we cannot believe in God's goodness towards
   us. But the inward emancipation from accustomed habits of possession
   and enjoyment is possible on one condition only. We must ourselves hold
   the conviction that the whole meaning of our lives is different from
   what we had been wont to imagine. We must ourselves experience a new
   fact, the influence of which upon us is so strong as to lessen the
   power over our souls of all our former possessions and enjoyments. Our
   own advantage may be seen to consist in a fact of this kind. We may,
   for example, recognise clearly what a loss it is to us if vast numbers
   of our people do not, and possibly cannot, rejoice in the sense of
   nationality. It is obvious that if we do perceive this fact we may
   promote social activity and stir .up the will to help; for stupidity is
   always unsocial. Yet social efforts based upon prudence arc bound by
   narrow restrictions, whereas there are no limits to the readiness to
   serve and to help that may be produced by the Gospel. For it results in
   an experience so rich that it can deliver a man from all cares
   concerning his own life, making him so free that the commonwealth,
   rather than his own advantage, really becomes the object of his
   desires.

   The Gospel not only sets ideas before us, but presents us with a mighty
   fact, such as, once experienced, gives to our life such height and
   depth as seems to enable us for the first time to perceive its
   immensity. This fact, which we must not merely "believe," but ourselves
   see, is the Person of Jesus Christ. In the New Testament it is enclosed
   in a series of narratives, as to the authenticity of which no efforts
   of learning are able to tell us anything very definite. To many
   Christians the narratives are nevertheless a matter of absolute
   certainty, while to others they are not so. The decision of this
   question does not depend upon the moral attitude or religious
   earnestness of the individual Christian; nor does its determination
   affect his spiritual fate, or the relation in which he stands to God.
   On the other hand, if a man is to lay hold of the Person of Jesus, as a
   reality which he himself cannot choose but admit, he must needs be
   morally alive; and upon such contact with Jesus Himself depends that
   inward sense of liberty which constitutes the Christian. Those who are
   not struck by the sincerity, strength, and wonderful assurance of the
   man Christ Jesus have no suspicion of what Christianity is. The
   decision which prompts a Christian to forsake the ways of the world and
   follow Jesus, leaves them all untouched; their hearts are strangers to
   the joy that cannot be taken away, and to the delight in active
   service, which mark the essential difference between one who is, and
   one who is not, a Christian.

   But if we are indeed to apprehend the Person of .Jesus in all its
   wonderful reality, we need a two-fold method of transmission. One of
   these is Holy Scripture; the other, human life, permeated and kindled
   by remembrance of Him--or, to use the old names, Scripture and
   tradition. Once we have begun to recognise as our greatest good this
   contact with the Person of Jesus, we shall seek the society of those
   whom His power has stirred, and the assemblies where He is likely to be
   preached. Before long we shall note further that, on any ideals we
   already possess, a new light is thrown continually by thronging
   memories of Him derived from Scriptural accounts. Thus the mystical
   power of His Person gives to Biblical tradition a value beyond any that
   dogma can confer, and, at the same time, is the warrant for complete
   freedom in scientific study of the Bible. For if we are convinced that
   this tradition reveals to us the highest gift the world can bestow, we
   shall also see that here, if anywhere, those laws must faithfully be
   observed that render possible the successful investigation of reality.
   Thus the Christian who knows and seeks nothing higher in all the world
   than the inward life--that is, the Person of Jesus in its power over
   the mind--is carried far above the conflict which is now agitating
   Protestantism; above the anxious piety that hardens into a legalism
   devoid of morality; and no less far above such investigation of truth
   as, sensible of no bonds of living history to bring it into touch with
   the traditional, is lacking in all piety.

   That Jesus of whom we ourselves have laid hold as a reality, undeniable
   and wonderful, works in us a transformation exceeding great in power.
   For contact with Him means that there dawns upon us a revelation of God
   that can never again be obscured. The first page of a book widely read
   at the present day contains the statement that no man who has once
   learned to know Jesus Christ can ever again be quite what he was
   before. One who can echo Harnack in this, feels that contact with the
   Person of Jesus marked a turning-point in his life. He may, indeed,
   often have to confess that it has not been followed in his case by very
   much that is new, but he will surely always admit in his heart that it
   might have been. In the Person of Jesus we at least seem to recognise a
   constant cause of uneasiness--of a disquietude that prevents us from
   settling down too comfortably in the world. Now, so long as that is our
   experience with regard to Jesus, He is indeed above us; and only in
   proportion as He Himself stands in that relation towards us can His
   words bring us a Gospel. Above all, they can really convince us, only
   when they interpret and throw new light upon the realities around us.
   We are told how Jesus Himself endeavoured to remind men of the traces
   of God's goodness revealed in their own lives. Yet after all,
   ultimately the one fact of our experience that lends undoubted
   testimony to the goodness of God towards us is the manifestation of
   Jesus Himself. It is when our inmost being is stirred and quickened by
   His Person that we are able to grasp something of the realities of
   which He speaks; and then, and not till then, His words become to us a
   gospel of power. But the fact that Jesus reveals the power and the
   goodness of God will soon be felt when once we realise that if we call
   to remembrance His will and His actions, they make demands upon us
   which are eternally binding. Jesus made provision for this by His death
   upon the Cross, and by explaining that Death in the Last Supper.
     __________________________________________________________________

CHAPTER X

  CONFLICT BETWEEN THE EVANGELISTIC AND MODERN OUTLOOK

   YET the Cross itself would be of no avail if it happened that in
   seeking our moral goal we had to look beyond Jesus Himself: Along the
   path of duty He must always be our Guide. This implies not only
   certainty on our part that He offers no opposition to duties
   indisputably self-evident to us, but, further, the ever fresh
   experience that it is the power of His Spirit which actually reveals to
   us those duties. If we were divided from Him in the work in which we
   ourselves recognised moral necessity, it would mean a separation
   radical indeed. We can continue to be Christians, only if we can
   honestly confess that the growth of moral earnestness and liberty
   within us brings us into closer touch with Him. Once we perceive any
   civil obligation of our age to be due to a moral necessity, we must be
   able to discern in it the victory of Jesus Christ. Otherwise we are
   indeed severed from Him, and circling already round another sun.

   To many, however, at the present time it seems impossible in this kind
   of work to be reminded of Jesus as a power, and especially so to those
   who refuse to take the words of Jesus lightly, and possess such a view
   of the duties of our Age as people can only possess when they are not
   merely looking on, but are themselves taking part in its work. By
   rendering to themselves a clear account of the meaning and aim of their
   exertions, they soon become aware of their remoteness from Jesus, if
   indeed they think of Him at all.

   Many of us devote our life-work to matters in which Jesus not only
   displayed no interest, but which He could not even know of, since they
   were not yet in being. Natural science was still unheard of; hence no
   glimmering conception of natural law enabled men to see an intelligible
   order in the realities around them; and systematic investigation had
   not yet extended the dominion of man over nature. In short, every kind
   of work arising out of natural science, with its own particular forms
   and aims, was for Jesus non-existent. It may, indeed, be said that both
   His attitude and ours towards morality are unaffected by that fact.
   Just as a peasant of to-day may, as regards moral development, put to
   shame a natural philosopher, so Jesus might still be our Guide in all
   matters of morality, even though he lived in a world of narrow
   limitations, whereas to us there is an infinite depth of meaning in
   realities constituted in accordance with fixed laws.

   We cannot, however, fail to note something else which made Jesus quite
   different from us. He betrayed no stronger interest in those
   departments of labour and business in which at that time able men were
   engaged. He was, indeed, acquainted with the husbandman toiling for the
   fruits of the earth and caring for his live stock. He was familiar also
   with the banker and the power of capital; yet there is not a word to
   show that He realised the importance of all these forms of work. He
   does not seem to have thought that the worth of a man is, as a rule,
   dependent upon his serving the community in some such way. Had He been
   as firmly persuaded as we are, that fidelity in this work of the world
   is the foundation in many a man of eternal righteousness, He would, one
   would think, have referred to it in some way, since His aim was to help
   men in their moral needs. Yet the Gospels nowhere relate that He did
   so; and it may therefore be presumed that in His sight it was not in
   faithful performance of such work that true righteousness consisted. It
   necessarily followed as a result of His energy, that He sought to
   release men from the burden of toil, and set them free for the one
   thing needful.

   There is no need to advance this as our own conclusion, for in every
   ear those words resound in which Jesus seems to deprive His disciples
   of the motive for remunerative work in general.

   We are not to be anxious. But the origin of all work of the above
   description is anxiety concerning food and raiment; and the efforts to
   secure these are incumbent upon man because, since he is a man, he has
   outgrown a purely animal existence. In proportion as we really desire
   to be of more value than many sparrows, we develop wants which unaided
   Nature is not able to satisfy. Thereupon follows anxiety as to how they
   can be satisfied; and yet we are told: "Be not anxious." We cannot
   escape the force of this saying by supposing that in the land where
   Jesus lived the lavish gifts of nature sufficed for the daily needs of
   man; for it was just the same there as here. The seed, indeed, grew of
   itself, but it had first to be sown; and though one man might support
   life on locusts and wild honey, all could not have done so. People were
   just as little able as we are to live without work--the result of
   anxiety with regard to food and clothing. Anxiety is always, moreover,
   the concomitant of labour. We must take thought for the safeguard of
   our possessions, in order to assure the success of our work, and we
   must consider whether the means we can command are sufficient for the
   task before us. It matters not whether these means of work are
   implements, landed property, capital; or the intellectual and physical
   powers we have inherited and developed, and the time at our disposal:
   such distinctions do not affect the main issue, as to the possibility
   of performing, without anxiety, the work imposed upon us the day we
   became men. We must resist the claims of the moment when they threaten
   to rob us of those instruments of work which will be required by the
   future. Yet Jesus tells us the reverse. We must, He says, be willing
   and ready to lend, and not only satisfy requests trenching upon our
   worldly possessions, but give even more than we are asked; and we must
   act in like manner with that which is often more precious to us than
   any goods--our time and our strength.

   It is obvious that in this workaday world such principles are
   impracticable; no business can be conducted on these lines. Yet that is
   just what Jesus seems to want. His disciples must separate themselves
   from the world of business transactions; for the proceeds of such work
   are once for all made obnoxious to them by His words concerning riches:
   "Lay not up for yourselves treasures upon earth." Accordingly, if a man
   has great possessions, the best thing he can do is to get rid of them
   in the form of alms; and to resist such counsel is to renounce
   perfection. Still, in the ultimate issue, all possession is wealth as
   compared to the penury of others; so that, if I try to retain for
   myself any such advantage, I am in bondage to riches. Nevertheless; "Ye
   cannot serve God and Mammon." How then can a disciple, who owns
   allegiance to the words of Jesus, be a citizen of that world where
   people work for gain and for possessions?

   One may, indeed, try to explain the saying about anxiety in such a way
   as not to disturb the current mode of thought--Jesus only meant, it may
   be said, that amidst all anxiety about his earthly calling, a disciple
   must always keep his heart at liberty; and to no Christian need that
   ever be impossible. I share this mode of thought, but I cannot agree
   that Jesus meant this by "Be not anxious." He could never have spoken
   so had He not thought it fitting that at that particular time the aims
   of industrial life should be left out of view; and this fact is shown
   even more clearly by His words concerning capital. The saying, "Lay not
   up for yourselves treasures upon earth," calls upon men to choose
   between directing their whole attention now to the good things of
   eternity, and allowing themselves to be tied down to earthly things.
   Any attempt to interpret this saying as capable of being obeyed while
   we retain our capital, would merely confirm the anticipation of .Jesus,
   that riches are stronger than those who fancy they possess them.
   According to the view taken by Jesus, the earthly treasure we acquire
   becomes our master, hindering us from serving God. We cannot eventually
   escape from the oft-repeated reproach: Christendom as a whole is not
   sincerely Christian so long as it declares itself willing and bound to
   obey the traditional words of Jesus, but remains in possession, or, as
   Jesus would say, in the service, of capital. If we allow ourselves to
   take up a doubtful position on this point, the compromise will paralyse
   our whole Christian life. We shall assuredly be separated from Jesus,
   not so much by seriously declining to obey some particular saying
   handed down to us as pronounced by Him at that particular time, as by
   assenting to the sum of all His words, if in practice that involves the
   refusal to obey them severally. It is inconsistency of this kind that
   insinuates into our trust in the Redeemer the constant doubt of His
   ability to redeem us if we do not really follow Him, though professing
   our willingness to do so.

   For many of us even now, work that is simply remunerative has no real
   moral character. We may indeed wonder what the result would be if all
   Christians were to decide for the perfection required of the rich young
   man in Luke xviii.; but we do not feel the demand to he one that
   compels us to withdraw from our moral duties. The words of Jesus,
   however, which urge us to forsake earthly possessions, do also strike
   at the root of moral obligations that bind us all--namely, the
   arrangements of human society. Such an attack is implied in the demand
   that we should, in order ourselves to attain to a higher grade of
   morality give away the goods, the time, and the strength that we
   possess; for we are well aware that all these belong, not to ourselves
   alone, but also to those who are more or less nearly related to us by
   the established order of society. When Jesus speaks as though these
   possessions were our own absolute property, and might therefore without
   scruple be given away, He disregards the social institutions by which
   we are particularly bound to individual men. The fact that He treated
   these institutions as of slight account, of itself separates Him from
   us. But He goes much further than that; for with incisive words he
   summons men to loose themselves from these bonds. Consequently, those
   who proposed to follow Him would soon feel that family ties are fetters
   to be cast off; and failure to throw them off would mean separation
   from Jesus. He who does not find something to hate in his father and
   mother cannot be Jesus' disciple (Luke xiv.).

   To us the repudiation of the State by Jesus is even more impressive,
   because more easily understood. Those who disallow the use of force,
   and authority based upon power, not only take no part themselves in
   civil life, but are fundamentally opposed to the State, since it must,
   according to their view, of necessity be wrong. The dissemination of
   such views tends to the downfall of the State, for to act on the
   principle of non-resistance to evil, and so refuse the legal remedies
   offered by the State, is to reject the State itself as devoid of any
   value.

   Thus Jesus brings us into conflict with social duties to which we all
   wish to cling. Our ambition is greater than merely to care for our own
   family, and so vindicate the sanctity of special ties that bind us to
   particular people. We wish also to preserve intact family life in
   general, as an indispensable means of morally developing every member
   of the human race. We call by the name of Father the eternal Power of
   Good, and so suggest the idea that the relation of parent and child
   reflects that light and warmth in which alone the youthful soul may
   grow and thrive. We see quite clearly too that the highest
   relationships, and those most full of meaning, between the individuals
   of any considerable group of human beings could not come into being, if
   their social life did not lead at the same time to the growth of the
   State.

   Had human nature not recognised as rational the existence of the State,
   the varied powers of individuals must have been mutually destructive,
   instead of complementary. While, however, establishment of law conduces
   to liberty as a whole, by affording free scope to social morality, it
   will, in particular instances, be felt to be a constraint.
   Consequently, it becomes permanent and effective only when subject to a
   ruling power. We are the more ready to serve this power, the more we
   realise that the good we desire in our own hearts is helped to win its
   way without by enforced order. At the same time we know that law itself
   has a right to exist only as a means designed to promote contemporary
   social life, and so we are anxious to co-operate in the alteration and
   expansion of the law. Not content with bemoaning the hardships that
   exist, we make use of the power at our disposal to change the rules of
   the State and make them more or less stringent, to suit our needs. But
   to Christians who wish not merely to reverence the words of Jesus, but
   also to obey them, withdrawal from this struggle between rival powers
   in the State appears to be necessary, because no political measure can
   be carried that is not oppressive to some. Yet how reconcile this with
   the temper that hopes through meekness to prevail? It is a strange way
   of obeying the words of Jesus: "So shall it not be among you." A
   Christianity that enforces its own advance seems to admire what Jesus
   says, and to do the opposite.

   Such ideas as the foregoing have again and again been mustered afresh,
   and addressed as passionate reproaches to the Church, on the ground
   that, while venerating Christ as God, it treats His words as though He
   were powerless against the world he claimed to have overcome. Even in
   our own Evangelical community at the present day there are ready
   listeners to such complaints. There are always amongst us still those
   who regard as mutually exclusive, obedience to the words of Jesus, and
   a compliance on serious moral grounds with civil obligations. We know
   no magic spell able to calm and clarify this ferment of confusion, but
   our own effort may enable us quietly to recognise the antithesis,
   without letting it separate us either from Jesus, or from those civil
   pursuits to which we are sure that God has called us. It is a vital
   question for Christianity, whether we can acknowledge Jesus Christ to
   be indeed our Leader. Yet neither the primitive Church, nor
   Protestantism in its early days, was able to explain how we could all,
   with an open heart, follow our Leader; and even now, it is from the
   very men who clamour loudest for absolute earnestness in following
   Jesus, that the beginnings of a right understanding of the matter meet
   with the most violent opposition. One obstacle to such understanding is
   a misuse of the moral directions of Jesus, secured in its position at
   an early date by the appearance of being a particularly zealous form of
   Christianity. With regard to this misuse, two things must be kept
   distinct--the circumstances, namely, to which it owes its origin and
   its support. Its main support is to be found in the fact that there was
   no clear knowledge of that historical situation from which the words of
   Jesus--viewed as the words of a sincere and earnest man--in large
   measure derived their meaning. Its origin is due to an extraordinary
   neglect of the Person of Jesus Himself.

   In the early days of Christianity, the first step was the perception of
   the fact that life and work in civilised society are in blunt contrast
   to many directions of Jesus. The Church proceeded to deal with this
   fact by assigning the two indispensable and irreconcilable sets of
   duties to two distinct classes of Christians. One of these was, within
   certain limits, to devote itself to the acquirement of power and
   possessions, while the other was to apply itself to obeying seriously
   the directions of Jesus. The former provided the necessaries of earthly
   life, but received something higher in exchange; for, in order that
   they too in their station, and in spite of their extremely defective
   obedience, might be saved, by the help of the second class, they were
   brought into union with Christ and into touch with salvation. Thus the
   very contradiction which at first had threatened to make the
   Christianising of society impossible, was afterwards used to promote
   it. This expedient has two great advantages which explain the fact that
   to many Christians it still gives satisfaction. In the first place, it
   is easily understood, in common with the whole system of Roman Catholic
   ethics, which, according to the "Grenzboten," is distinguished by
   intelligibility. In the second place, such an arrangement keeps alive
   the idea that a life spent in imitation of Jesus is something
   excessively great, calling for efforts surpassing the power of the
   common run of men. This was a decision equally pleasing to the
   serious-minded and the frivolous; and as Christian society is usually
   composed of both classes, it was, and is still, a useful notion. Such a
   device for embracing two very opposite tendencies is, like Catholicism
   in general, excellent policy; but the most perfect contrivances of
   statesmanship are powerless to solve moral problems. The question of
   morality, for whose supremacy Christendom was supposed to be ripe, was
   for the time completely shelved.

   The conflict between rival claims, the battlefield of which must be the
   individual conscience, had made way for a conflict of institutions,
   which was adjusted by the world-dominion of the Church. Acquiescence in
   this political solution of a moral question, means, however, for
   serious as for thoughtless men, that they cease to be moral. The
   flagrant immorality that was always reappearing in the monastic orders,
   among the would-be "perfect" class, was no mere degeneracy, but was
   actually a result of the want of discipline inherent already in the
   principles of monasticism, the worst feature of that life being its
   very ideal of perfection. Luther it was who first presented in this
   light the religion and morality of Catholicism, thus bringing discredit
   on its solution of the problem now before us.

   To Luther the radical evil of monastic life was the undisciplined
   arbitrariness of its aims. Especially noteworthy is the fact that
   Luther's first thought in the matter was not of disobedience to the
   commands of Jesus. To him the essential point seemed to be that we
   should each one consider what are the duties laid upon us simply by the
   particular powers given to us in our definite place in the world;
   failure to do so was in his eyes very deplorable self-will. He felt
   that for any man to despise the obligations arising out of his natural
   position in the world means revolt against the will of the Almighty, to
   whom he owes his existence. The object of the monk is to show perfect
   obedience; but by evading calls which he cannot but recognise as the
   voice of God, he becomes wholly disobedient and undisciplined. Other
   people, faithfully pursuing their ordinary business, do remain in the
   school of God; but their life, too, is poisoned by the Church, since
   they are compelled to bear the secret reproach of having failed to
   choose the way of perfection, though it was open to them to do so. The
   Church, indeed, encourages them to stifle such self-reproaches; their
   mode of life is necessary, or at least useful, to the Church, and the
   perfect way is only recommended, not required. For a considerable time,
   too, men's consciences may be satisfied thus.

   Sooner or later, however, those to whom a measure of Christianity has
   hitherto sufficed, will have to face the question as to what is
   absolutely necessary for themselves. If monastic withdrawal from the
   world is perfection, a man, though admitting the fact, may for a season
   be satisfied by the doctrine, that God has not done more than counsel
   such perfection. But in the end he cannot fail to perceive that this
   God is a phantom. For the living God of the conscience is inexorable in
   His demand, that we ought to do what in our own mind we recognise as
   perfection. He Himself is perfect, and we are to be even as He is.
   Moral corruption is more intense among the monastics, because, in their
   dream of perfection, conscience is lulled to rest; amongst the
   Christian laity, conscience may be actively alive, though only in a
   state of restlessness and uncertainty. Both lack the open-hearted
   submission to necessity, that constitutes moral obedience. Self-will
   leads, in the one case, to vain-glory, in the other to uncertainty.

   Although Luther recognised this fact, he had not yet succeeded in
   solving the problem. He had only pressed home once more upon the
   conscience of the individual Christian the question as to how he was
   unreservedly to follow Jesus, and yet take his share of strife and
   struggle in the world of secular work. Luther had, moreover, found
   courage to face this question through faith in the Father of Jesus
   Christ, but he could not show how to settle it. The result of the
   Reformation on this point was to promote not progress entirely, but
   also a reaction, as compared with the Church of Rome.

   An Evangelical Church, trying to maintain its position in the world,
   without the means of coercion Rome had employed, had all the greater
   need of coherent strength within. But this it could not have, if it was
   the duty of the evangelical Christian to give himself up to work in the
   world, and at the same time to hearken to the words of Jesus which
   forbade him to do so. A Church that had to fight for its very existence
   could not afford to harbour such an unexplained contradiction. The
   individual unrest and the battle of intellects caused by tormenting
   questions, seemed altogether opposed to the resolute bearing so
   urgently required. Our fathers, therefore, endeavoured to save the
   Evangelical Church by exhibiting such a dogmatic certainty as also
   obliged them to suppress to the utmost any idea that, in the sphere of
   morality, there were questions still unsolved by them. The consequence
   was that in dealing with the present question they went to even lower
   depths than Catholic ethics had done. The tendency became habitual to
   hide, as far as possible, the contrast between the words of Jesus and
   the secular life upon which men were entering with such vigour.
   Practically the same kind of thing is still prevalent among us to-day.
   But as long as it continues we lack a very important factor in the
   vital energy of the Church of Rome--an element that is founded on
   truth, namely, a vivid sense of the above contrast, and an unrest on
   the part of Christians in their dealings with the world.

   We are, however, beginning to rise above the level reached at the
   Reformation. It will help us to do so if we consider the limitations by
   which Luther himself was bound when he dealt with the problem. These
   limitations, insurmountable by Luther, explain why we too still allow
   ourselves to be perplexed by the contrast between the meekness and
   compassion of Jesus and our own desire and ready use of power. Rightly
   understood, the contrast is of inestimable service to us--a fact that
   cannot much longer be ignored. For the limitations which prevented
   Luther from perceiving this are gradually being removed, in the case,
   at any rate, of those who are heirs, not only of his mantle, but also
   of his life and spirit.

   To Luther it was the sacred duty of every man to work in the world to
   which he belonged, since God has planted him there. Luther's thought
   was powerfully influenced by the fact that a Christian may, in the
   conduct of his life, and in the definite character impressed upon his
   existence by the force of nature, discern the will of his Creator and
   Father. The greatness of Luther lay in his keen sensibility towards
   this revelation of God, a revelation such as a Christian cannot find in
   the Bible, but must, by inward conflict, gain for himself. For a man to
   be induced by the statements of certain authorities, to refuse
   obedience to this revelation, was in his eyes godlessness. He had
   experienced the power of a faith that is neither custom nor illusion,
   since it begins when a man has the courage to consider his own
   position, and becomes serious enough to yield to realities.

   In moral questions, on the other hand, Luther was less clear-sighted.
   The moral character, or religious sincerity, did indeed find in him
   free scope, but his actual ideas on morality were still essentially
   restricted by Catholicism. He only laid a heavy burden on the false
   ideals of Catholicism, making it hard for them to survive the due
   appreciation of that secular work which, according to his view, every
   individual is bound to recognise as required of him by God. Luther did
   not overcome that misuse of the moral directions of Jesus, which in the
   Church of Rome displayed it full and fatal strength. He, too, takes it
   for granted that a Christian at least is bound to obey every word of
   Jesus that has been handed down and was not expressly addressed to a
   particular individual; without inquiring if the demand it contains
   really concerns himself in his own particular circumstances. Obedience
   of this kind is, however, a monstrous misuse of the words of Jesus, and
   to a Christianity whose aim is to abide in the world, it eventually
   leaves no choice but a division into clerics and laity, to the moral
   detriment of both. Thus it is that even on Reformation soil the old
   weaknesses are wont to reappear, concealing under cover of moral
   earnestness an entire lack of discipline within. Yet, granted that
   where such use is made of the words of Jesus, the result is as stated
   above, we should still have no right to call it an abuse of words, if
   Jesus Himself so intended them, that every man must blindly obey, even
   without apprehending the truth they contain. Let us consider the facts.

   Undoubtedly Jesus did make demands to which He expected from all His
   disciples unconditional obedience. But He never required any one
   blindly and hastily to comply with His words, without understanding
   them. He asked in every case for something more than this; not merely
   submission, but the inward obedience of a free agent. His words are
   binding upon those who really accept them; and this real acceptance
   they win by promoting the tendency to independence inherent in the
   will. Thus the true disciple of Jesus can never throw off the influence
   of His words, for they have become a revelation of necessary truths.

   It is becoming easier for us than it was for our forefathers, or for
   Luther himself, to gain this right attitude towards the words of Jesus,
   because to us something has been given that at the outset may greatly
   depress us. We can listen to the Man Jesus, speaking in His own
   generation, and addressing His contemporaries. For Luther, on the other
   hand, it was as yet impossible to grasp the meaning of many of the
   words of Jesus, simply because the historical study of the Bible,
   started by himself, was in its infancy. We admire his argumentative
   skill in exposition, wherever religious vigour alone could reach the
   root of the matter; and we excuse his deficient explanations, where
   nothing could avail but the historical method --only developed since by
   the gradual work of centuries. As long as the Man Jesus could not be
   seen in historical perspective, it was possible to regard all His words
   as addressed to the people of to-day; but the historical research of
   the present time makes that impossible.

   To many this is a source of pain. The Biblical scholar, indeed, the
   result of whose work has proved of special help to us in this matter,
   remarks, in reference to the needs of the moment, that we would give
   anything to have words of Jesus showing how to deal with the political
   and economic obligations of modern life; yet we possess no such
   directions. [3] These sad words of resignation show how easily
   historians misinterpret the results of their own investigations of the
   past. The one great benefit conferred upon us by their studies is the
   way they help us to get rid of such longings and regrets. They show us
   why guidance of this sort cannot possibly be found in the words of
   Jesus. We may grieve if something possible is denied us, but we must
   reconcile ourselves to what, with our own eyes, we perceive to be
   impossible.

   The Biblical knowledge of the present day teaches us that many duties
   of social morality, unavoidable by us, were quite unknown to Jesus.
   Thus to Him it was not yet a problem how far the State can give
   assistance in economic life. More especially, however, He held a view
   of the world that left Him no concern for the future of human society,
   for He looked upon this as having in store no future at all, but as
   being near its end. He saw the beginning of the destruction of the
   world approaching; He felt the final judgment to be near. This caused
   Him to overlook many ties whereby we of necessity are bound, and, since
   He aimed at preparing souls for this approaching glory, He was bound to
   make of them demands coloured by this expectation. In particular cases,
   perhaps, it can seldom be determined with certainty how far the words
   of Jesus are influenced by His expectation of the approaching end of
   the world; perhaps only one can be mentioned, namely, the prohibition
   to "lay up treasures upon earth." Laying by so as to enhance our own
   existence by acquiring a wide control over circumstances is altogether
   meaningless if a complete transformation of existence and environment
   is actually imminent. But even with regard to this, every disciple,
   even though he did not share this expectation, must still have read in
   these words an urgent warning to himself. Unless he can detach himself
   from earthly gain, unless he can say that something incomparably great
   entirely fills his soul, he is a fool, like the rich man laying up his
   corn. Only in so far as it is our aim to press all earthly interests
   into the service of this one true good, as yet unrealised in the
   present world, can these interests themselves be objects of our desire.

   The expectation of an impending change in the established order of
   things is further shown by the quietly negative attitude with which
   Jesus passes by the forms and claims of existing civilisation, not
   finding it necessary to emphasise any feature thereof as important for
   His followers.

   In every other case isolated demands involve, indeed, not rules of
   universal application, but possibilities that may, under special
   circumstances, become matters of moral necessity, and are unaffected by
   the proximity or remoteness of the end of the world. Above all, eager
   though we may be to turn to full account, in explaining the words of
   Jesus, His eschatological standpoint, we must not be tempted thus to
   explain also the command to love our enemies. We cannot think to make
   this intelligible by saying that the approach of the last day would,
   with our other wishes, remove all desire for revenge. The demand to
   love our enemies is indeed tremendous, and necessarily beyond the
   comprehension of all but those who, in the Person of Jesus, have found
   the beginning of a new life; but the fact of Jesus Himself is yet more
   tremendous. Even to the disciple of Jesus to love his enemies is a task
   too great for his own strength; yet it is to Him an elementary and,
   beyond any doubt, morally a perfectly reasonable demand.

   It is, indeed, certain that, once our attention is called to the
   eschatological standpoint of Jesus, we are compelled to make two
   admissions. In the first place, we feel that a barrier is raised
   between Him and us by our having honestly to confess that we do not
   share that standpoint--we are not very greatly affected by the idea of
   an approaching end of the world. Secondly, circumstances in which we
   see the promise of a better future, in His eyes were only harbingers of
   ruin. In Him there was nothing of the zeal of the political and
   economic reformer.

   Grief at separation from Jesus due to these important features in His
   conception of the world is, however, as nothing compared with our joy
   at the benefits we receive from God in this knowledge. If one of our
   links with esus is removed, it is one which He denied us himself. By
   the dream now disturbed, all our powers are paralysed, even those that
   really unite us with Jesus, because given by Himself. Sympathy with
   Jesus and readiness to obey each word that bears His name, is
   beneficial when He Himself is working in us. It is therefore a rude
   awakening, when we perceive that Jesus does not respond to this
   sympathy, and that we must consider for our own selves our actual
   position. We feel as it were deserted, when first we realise that
   detachment from all earthly things, to which Jesus in those days
   invited His disciples, is for us impossible, in the different world in
   which we live. What for them was a vigorous pursuit of their whole
   conception of the universe, and consequently sincere, would for us be
   self-deception, because we do not feel ourselves to be face to face
   with the end of the world but with innumerable obligations imposed upon
   us by the world.

   Now, historical research, by revealing this difference, prevents us
   from following Jesus in the same way that those who aim at perfection,
   in the Church of Rome try to do. The result is a great gain, for such
   supposed imitation of Jesus must eventually produce insincerity. Where
   it prevails, we find manly energy expended in restricting men to a
   childish existence. Seeking to emancipate themselves from the world,
   people sink into a barbarism that is in truth the highest degree of
   secularisation of human life. They wish to abandon all struggles for
   earthly ends, and to be free to serve God; in reality they do but
   exchange for petty tortures, in a close and narrow atmosphere, those
   exertions, worthy of their strength, for which God provides in His
   world such vast opportunities. Where is there more quarrelling than
   among those who, in all the world, find nothing worth their while to
   do? Endeavours to imitate Jesus in points inseparable from His especial
   mission in the world, and His position--which is not ours,--towards
   that world--efforts like these lacking the sincerity of really
   necessary tasks, have so long injured the cause of Jesus, that our joy
   will be unalloyed when scientific study at last reveals to every one
   the impossibility of all such attempts.

   It is true that this impossibility is not yet recognised by all.
   Friedrich Paulsen [4] looks upon the name "Tolstoi" as in itself a
   proof that it is possible even now so to obey the words of Jesus that
   one would not shrink from condemning the basis of modern civilisation,
   the power of the State. It is mostly, we may add, among Protestants
   that the numerous and enthusiastic admirers of Leo Tolstoi are to be
   found. They extol him not only as a great artist, not only as a
   powerful and venerable man, thus according him rightful praise; but
   they further reverence him as a pioneer in the region of moral thought,
   as a prophet preparing the way,--and that expressly on account of his
   so applying the words of Jesus as to destroy the fabric of
   civilisation. Yet all this is no proof of the practical and moral
   possibility of absolutely obeying in our rule of life to-day, the
   traditional words of Jesus. It merely discloses the fact that even yet
   a want of moral clearness too often allows men to fancy such an
   attitude to be possible, or actually commanded.

   Neither Tolstoi's greatness nor our veneration of him, as a man, need
   suffer if he may be reproached with a certain lack of moral clearness.
   In our experience complete freedom from such limitations belonged to
   One alone,--Who is thereby exalted above us all, and in Whom it was
   inseparable from the consciousness of His dignity and mission as
   Redeemer. It is one of the most encouraging signs of the times that so
   many people are powerfully affected by Tolstoi's moral greatness. He
   has given the world of civilisation a gift of inestimable value in the
   extraordinarily graphic descriptions,--contained, for example, in his
   "Confessions,"--of his struggle up out of the artistic life of glitter
   and amusement, and a mere luxuriating in fine feelings, and his
   decision for a life of action. Even more important are his deeds of
   sacrifice, and the emphatic witness they bear to the tremendous
   obligations of those who occupy high places in the world and hear, from
   depths of misery, the groaning of the multitude.

   Nevertheless, we who are Evangelical Christians must not let our
   gratitude to Tolstoi prevent us from quietly insisting that he misuses
   the words of Jesus in a manner which, through a weakness in
   Christianity, has long been familiar to us. Evangelical Christians who
   extend their admiration of Tolstoi even to this matter are without
   excuse, except perhaps on the ground that others have not properly
   revealed to them that new understanding of the Gospel which came into
   vogue at the Reformation. For Tolstoi, on the other hand, there is
   every excuse: he bears the impress of the Russian State, of Russian
   civilisation, and of the Russian Church. The best feature in the
   Russian Church is its reverence for tradition, and in this respect
   Tolstoi is a true son of the Church. All its other restraints he was
   able by his strength of character to cast off, daring to trust solely
   in Jesus and His Word. But in the attitude which he takes up towards
   the precious gift of tradition, he is again overpowered by the forces
   of Eastern Christianity. Towards the Word of Jesus, where he cannot
   develop the truth of its meaning, his attitude is one of resignation;
   for he asserts the necessity of obeying the word of Jesus, as a rule of
   universal application: "Resist not him that is evil." Yet he does not
   realise that he himself would be responsible for the disorder that must
   result from such voluntary endurance of wrong and such renunciation of
   the use of force. Such a responsibility does not press heavily upon a
   Russian Christian: it is overpowered by the consolations of piety; and
   though he should thus deny the State its right to exist, the matter is
   one that troubles a Russian less than it would trouble us. For he has
   obviously not yet reached that point of historical development where
   moral enthusiasts, such as the Apostle Paul, are the first to recognise
   clearly the moral value in the power of the State. Finally, it is easy
   to understand why a Russian is ready to accept the words of Jesus about
   renunciation of the world, for he cannot fail to see on every side the
   havoc wrought among his people by an exotic civilisation. But what, in
   the case of this powerful Russian, may be explained by the light of
   history, ought, for us Evangelical Germans, to be a moral
   impossibility. Even Friedrich Paulsen will admit that we cannot
   conscientiously follow a line of conduct suggested to Jesus by an
   expectation we no longer share. Historical research in this respect has
   helped to emancipate us.

CHAPTER XI

  THE REAL MIND OF JESUS

   OF far greater importance, however, than this deliverance from the yoke
   of a transitory past, is that closer union with Jesus Himself and His
   inmost thoughts, which is worthy to prevail for ever and ever. Yet it
   is not by scientific research that this can be attained, but by a moral
   insight into the moral conceptions of Jesus. Nor can it be denied that
   from time to time monks, or those who, in their would-be imitation of
   Jesus, revert to the standpoint of anarchy, do surpass the student of
   history by retaining closer hold of tradition, and by seeking not
   merely to know one historic fact out of many but Jesus Christ Himself.
   In the hearts of individual Christians the spiritual power of Jesus has
   long supplied what was lacking in Luther's works upon the Church--that
   moral insight, whereby we still may recognise Jesus as our Leader and
   perceive the illuminating truth of the words which, if treated as
   patterns to be copied exactly, separate men from truth, and so from
   Christ. A single word of Jesus may kindle this understanding; yet
   neither any one of them, nor all of them together, can make us realise
   their truth. This can only happen if we seek Jesus Himself. By this
   nothing fanciful is meant, but simply the endeavour to understand the
   mind whence proceeded these wonderful, terrible, and yet gracious
   words. The words of Jesus, indeed, can be tabulated, but not His moral
   ideas. For these we can only apprehend when we recognise them as the
   outcome of a Will that is not something arbitrary, but a mind at peace
   in eternity.

   Of the mind of Jesus and His Person we can gain a clear idea by
   observing the nature of the moral difference between Himself and those
   around Him. Does it consist in the principle that righteousness is a
   matter not only of outward action, but of inward disposition? Is that
   what is meant by the better righteousness towards which He sought to
   direct His disciples? But to men familiar with the words of the
   prophets, "This people honoureth me with their lips, but their heart is
   far from me," and with the prayer, "Create in me a clean heart, O God,"
   this distinction surely was not new. In this respect the difference
   between Jesus and the righteous of His nation can only have consisted
   in the thoroughness with which He applied the principle; and this it
   was that gave Him the right to call them hypocrites. If, however, we
   stop short at this point, we are far indeed from really comprehending
   Him in the strength and unity of His mind.

   That which is peculiar to the moral thought of Jesus is that He
   actually develops this principle further, and so for the first time
   exhibits its full force. He is riot content, like the prophets, to
   attack hypocrisy in the sense of a deliberate discrepancy between what
   one really is and what one would like to appear; He also exposes its
   radical nature. Jesus undoubtedly knew that, in the ordinary sense of
   the term, the Pharisees were no hypocrites--ready, as they were,
   whenever the inviolability of the law was at stake, to face death at
   the hands of the Romans. Nevertheless, Jesus did plainly decide that
   the fearful corruption of their spiritual nature made them ripe for the
   judgment of hell. He further tells them that they say, but fail to do;
   nor do they themselves fulfil the demands which they make. But it was
   not from want of activity, as commonly understood, that they left any
   duties undone; they were zealous to the last degree. The thing they
   lacked was in their eyes of secondary consequence--something for which
   they had no time, because for them the all-important matter was to
   fulfil the law with the greatest possible exactitude. To them,
   therefore, it was not an object of close concern that their will should
   be sincere and at one with itself, conscious of its eternal right. They
   did, indeed, aim at fulfilling the law, but only in order to prove
   themselves righteous, and so to attain something quite different. They
   wanted to serve two masters--a feat that, according to Jesus, is made
   impossible by the nature of the will. In seeking to understand in
   minutest detail a variety of isolated precepts, they overlooked the one
   essential matter of the law, the demand for justice, mercy, and
   faithfulness, as a means to genuine fellowship. They were not grounded
   upon the truth; they neglected that sincerity which must see for itself
   the meaning and rightful claim of the law, and thus discovers how to
   fulfil it. They made of the law a burden grievous to be borne, but did
   not themselves feel its weight, because it was easy for them to satisfy
   unintelligible demands, and because they rightly saw how possible it is
   to finish and be quit of such tasks as are not understood. They
   imagined they really did well-nigh fulfil the law, and looked upon
   themselves as profitable servants. Meanwhile they were preventing its
   moral ideas from taking effect, because they thought it not worth while
   to investigate their truth.

   The morality of the Pharisees still flourishes among us. Of the leaders
   of thought in our nation many are horrified at being told that a man
   can do what is good only if his will is directed towards the pursuit of
   truth, as he himself perceives it. They say that, on the contrary, we
   require "objective" ordinances, telling us quite definitely what we
   have to do. If they meant that there is general need of law, custom,
   and personal authority, they would indeed be right. To ignore the fact
   is as childish as it is dangerous, for only in the peace and order due
   to these forces can the good make progress among us. What such leaders
   of our people mean, however, is that to obey these authorities is in
   itself to do that which is good, and, worse still, that we arrive at a
   knowledge of the good by deducing it from laws impressed upon us by
   nature and by history. They therefore declare that they have no eyes to
   see for themselves what is good. Yet these blind leaders of the blind
   are full of honest zeal, although different in kind from that of the
   Pharisees, who are otherwise their prototypes. They at least direct the
   people towards Jesus Christ,--a fact we acknowledge with gratitude and
   wish to turn to account.

   Only by observing how Jesus goes to the root of the insincerity and
   indolence underlying this conception of morality can we see clearly the
   meaning of his moral ideas in their bearing on ourselves.

   In the course of His unrelenting war upon the self-deception of the
   righteous men around Him, He reveals beyond dispute the source of in
   ward sincerity and singleness of purpose. This, according to Jesus, is
   implied in the nature of volition. We can only will one thing. Contrive
   as we may, we cannot serve two masters, and if we persist in attempting
   it we end in insincerity and enter into conflict with a law within
   ourselves, the truth of which is evident. Just as the eye must needs be
   single, not wandering hither and thither, but fixed simply upon one
   point, if it is really to give to the organism the necessary light, so
   the whole inward man is full of darkness unless the will can
   concentrate its every impulse in one direction, in the thought of one
   eternal goal.

   But in order to do that we must know the goal. Did Jesus perhaps think
   that His mission consisted in showing men where to find it? Not so. He
   knew that the essence of the law was known throughout Israel, the
   commandments enjoining love to God and to one's neighbour--both
   comprised in one. He knew too that, after all, it is easy to draw from
   every man the acknowledgment of who his neighbour is, and that
   consequently when any is unmerciful he is self-condemned at the same
   time. Jesus aimed rather at proving that by no word coming to us from
   without can we come to know what is good; the undeviating direction of
   our will must receive its impulse from within. For this purpose He
   employed a twofold method: in the first place, as against mere piety,
   He vindicated the claims of moral righteousness, and in the second
   place he explained the meaning of love.

   It is indeed certain that in a manner altogether unique Jesus lived in
   the thought of God as all in all, our one and only good. For, when at
   length He saw in His own victory the coming of the Kingdom of God, for
   Him this meant solely that blissful future, whose necessary condition
   is that God alone shall reign within us. All good things that do not
   exactly draw us nearer to God prepare the way for our destruction. We
   can attain to freedom, life, and goodness, only if we renounce all else
   for the sake of God. True righteousness is love of God. But from these
   fundamental principles of piety the conclusion came to be drawn that
   our supreme duty is obedience to the traditional will of God,--a
   procedure whereby we are exposed to a danger terrible indeed, since it
   leads to a form of piety fatal to any moral clearness. For, amongst
   commandments handed down as expressing the will of God, there is always
   a tendency to rank those highest which set forth our immediate duty to
   God. It necessarily follows that precepts relating to the cultus assume
   greater prominence than commandments dealing with conduct towards other
   men. This Jesus found in those righteous enthusiasts round Him who with
   ever greater care, strove to develop and elaborate the rules delivered
   to them for the service of God. But in His eyes the righteousness of
   such a method of serving God was subversive of a living service; IIe
   saw in it the carcase round which the eagles are gathered together.

   Jesus will not hear of our allowing the claims of the cultus to thrust
   aside the duty of ministering to the needs of any committed to our
   charge. His stern condemnation of conduct of that kind is shown in the
   example of the pious son, who might thus excuse himself for refusing
   succour to his aged parents, if what might have been of service to them
   was offered to God as a sacrifice. In this passage in Mark vii., Jesus
   calls attention to the discord produced within, when a distinction is
   drawn between parents' needs and God's demands. Yet why should regard
   for parents take precedence of cultic observance, since that, too, is
   included in the Mosaic law? Because, it might be replied, the prophets
   already had said that mercy is better than sacrifice. Of this teaching
   there was doubtless, in the days of Jesus, a vivid recollection in
   Israel, as is clearly shown by the Scribe mentioned in Mark xii.; yet
   under the fostering care of these Scribes there had sprung up and
   flourished a religion whose life involved the death of morality.

   Jesus was the first to show how to overcome this monstrous state of
   things. Once we hold that nothing can tell us what is good but a
   tradition given by God, religion will preponderate over the moral
   sentiment in a manner fatal to itself. Our only safeguard consists in
   perceiving that moral earnestness,--in other words, sincerity of the
   will,--is the first step in that religion wherein the living God is
   truly sought. The Biblical expression for religion is: Trust in God,
   Love for God. Genuine trust in God consists in feeling oneself to be a
   child of God; and love for God consists in setting before one, as the
   one final object of one's will, such union with God as implies desire
   to become a child of God. Now, according to Jesus, this can only be
   attained by moral obedience, by such love for one's neighbour as is
   unmoved by the enmity of men. Thus he looks upon moral discernment as a
   primary element in all truc religion. We cannot love God unless we have
   begun to feel that inward peace which culminates in the love of our
   enemies. It is impossible to long for God Himself, if we know not what
   is good: for God alone is good. If we are to find and follow God, we
   must recognise the good. Thus Jesus attacks the mistaken idea that, in
   order to recognise the good, we must first know God, and understand His
   commandments. To those who hold that view, He puts the question: (Luke
   xii.) "Why even of yourselves judge ye not what is right?"

   The same truth Jesus has deeply impressed upon us by His explanation of
   the commandment as to love. The moral ideas of Jesus are surely
   especially those that unfold the meaning of this love which constitutes
   the unity of His mind. But to attain a real understanding thereof, it
   is not sufficient simply to point out that it is a love of God which is
   also love of one's neighbour, and a love of one's neighbour which is at
   the same time love of God. For that does not as yet reveal the
   characteristic temper of love. Jesus, to show this, explains wherein it
   differs from mere just dealing. This method of elucidating the matter
   has, it is true, not infrequently served to obscure it. Thus it may
   easily appear that the nature and operation of love are distinguished
   from stern justice by greater laxity. But that is not at all the love
   that Jesus means. Of this love we may attain a clear conception by
   noting wherein it differs from justice; and the first distinction is
   that it is more stringent than any justice. Justice admits exceptions;
   love knows none. Justice has no one constant aim, but follows the
   changes of human nature revealing themselves in history. What may at
   some future date be justice it is impossible to tell. Love is ready,
   indeed, with unwearied versatility, to adapt itself to every impulse;
   but its aim is unalterably directed to a goal it knows--namely, a
   personal fellowship, wherein all feel in each other a happiness which
   surpasses every other joy. The will to love seeks to produce and
   intensify such fellowship around it, recognising this as its eternal
   goal, and regarding it as unthinkable that it could ever will anything
   else. The peace of mind produced by a clearly perceived and constant
   goal makes the will to love both stronger and sterner than any form of
   justice. The love that .Jesus means must be thought of as the highest
   exercise of will-power, the concentrated force of a mind that knows the
   object of its will When Jesus calls upon men to love their enemies, He
   is not asking them to do something extraordinary,--something
   marvellous, and impossible to understand; but to give a clear example
   of that exercise of will whose sole object is personal fellowship. Such
   purpose is supported by the clear discernment of its own eternal law;
   and consequently is not loss of individual life, but the most intensely
   concentrated and living action of the will.

   Love is in the second place distinguished from justice by the character
   of its motives. Legal obedience is always induced by definite
   enactments; love is not. A will dependent on such impulse from without
   is not of the nature of love. Genuine love takes its orders from
   itself. The fact that others set before us the goal of true personal
   fellowship, cannot determine us to lead a life full of love; for this
   goal, standing fast in its right for ever and ever, can be understood
   only by one who is full of love, and by free choice makes it his own.
   Again, as love is the recognition from within of an eternal goal, it is
   guided step by step by its self-determined course. What it itself
   judges to be, in its especial circumstances, the best way to reach the
   eternal goal, must always be its way; it is acquainted with no other.
   Should it submit to any other laws, either its free confidence would be
   overcome by fear, or its energy sink into indolence. Though, like the
   heroic Pharisees, a man suffer martyrdom for his faith, that is, for
   obedience to the law, if he has not in himself something of this
   sincerity and independence of love, according to the Apostle Paul, he
   is nothing.

   Now it is true that, in point of time, love begins in every case only
   when a man experiences love. Whence the ceaseless efforts of Jesus to
   rouse men to a sense of the unfailing love actually experienced by
   them. But, once this dawning consciousness has done its quickening
   work, a man possesses life within himself. Then will his activity no
   longer be based, like mere just dealing, upon regard for his own
   interest, which might be advanced by promoting the welfare of others;
   nor upon promptings of sympathy, arising from a fellowship already
   established. Once love has come into being, its operation is entirely
   self-determined. It cannot accept laws from without, but from its own
   inner consciousness lays down the law for itself. It is no longer
   dependent on an object worthy of love, as it was at the outset, when it
   was first kindled, but, like God's sun, freely and abundantly scatters
   abroad its peculiar riches. To it the sublime calmness of creative
   power belongs; its nature and its force are divine. Jesus teaches that
   this is so; and yet He says that love, and love alone, is required of
   every man. The fact that Jesus can demand it, because He knows there
   will spring up this free and active power of love in those who gather
   round Him, and in whose lives the light now shines through His
   manifestation of Himself:--this is what Redemption means for us.

   In the third place, the scope of love is unlimited; its work is never
   at an end. Any duty which we may hope to finish and have done with, is
   not a moral duty. Those whose sole knowledge is of finite tasks, have
   not yet attained to the inward life and liberty of a moral frame of
   mind. The accomplishment of anything felt by love to be a duty, leads
   to new obligations, greater than the last. If any man, striving after
   fellowship with those amongst whom he is thrown, imagines he can set
   any limits to his labours, that man's will is not yet moral in its
   nature. If genuine fellowship with others is really the sole object of
   our will, we shall content ourselves with nothing less than an infinite
   capacity for service. We shall then be prepared for the possibility of
   having to disregard all boundaries whereby our rights are fenced, if we
   would be able to fulfil our purpose of serving the community. If real
   love is ours, we are ready for any sacrifice that may establish a
   common bond of kinship between ourselves and those around us. That is
   the self-denial to which we are called by Jesus; not a meaningless
   abandonment of our own individual powers, but the exerting of them to
   the utmost, the willingness to give them all to the great cause. What
   arises on this foundation is no mere "frame of mind in fashion like a
   house of cards;" for where service is of this kind it is upon an open
   recognition of necessity that a man is built up. If he is a Christian,
   he rejoices in the promise that his sacrifice is the key to those
   riches of the world that quicken the heart of man to its deepest
   depths.

   The mind that is alive in Jesus, and that He requires of us, is rooted
   and grounded in the knowledge that one thing alone is good,--a will
   intent upon the fellowship of self-conscious beings,--in other words,
   love. This mind, in accordance with His explanation of love, is
   uniform, independent, exhaustless volition. Its crowning-point is the
   perception that this will is the power over all, is God. When we have
   so understood the mind of Jesus and the unity of His moral ideas, we
   may return to those words of His which seemed to require that we should
   utterly renounce what to-day we can separate no longer from the
   obligations of social morality, namely, the pursuit of power and
   possessions. We shall now be able, in explaining them, to avoid former
   errors.

   Above all, a fallacy underlies the very desire to derive from these
   words "the moral conceptions of Jesus." The attempt might be permitted
   in the case of a confused and indolent thinker, who may possibly be the
   recipient of certain inspirations containing luminous moral ideas. But
   if we have at least come to know Jesus as a person full of moral
   clearness and vigour, it should be obvious that in seeking His moral
   ideas, we must look to the unity of His mind, before asking the
   question how, in relation to His whole mind, and the circumstances of
   the case, such and such individual sayings are to be understood.

   The particular circumstances in which the words were spoken require
   careful consideration. But this does not mean, as some modern
   historians sometimes contend, that it is mainly in the anticipation of
   the approaching end of the world that the key is to be found to those
   words of Jesus which run counter to the way of thinking common among
   men. We cannot, of course, deny that this expectation had a certain
   amount of influence; but the characteristic note in the words of Jesus
   is due above all to His intentness upon the eternal goal, whereby the
   verdict is determined in the day of judgment. As a natural consequence
   of such intentness on the end, it follows that no intervening objects.
   can be unreservedly, and so in all sincerity, objects of the will. It
   ought in any case to be impossible to include among the words explained
   by the idea that the end of the world was approaching, those dealing
   with the love of peace. Yet they have been said to express the
   unapproachable exaltation with which one who is set free from a
   perishing world can face his enemy; and accordingly, not really to
   refer to the will to help that enemy, and establish relations with him,
   in order to win him over. In like manner, the saying concerning the
   blow and its requital has been explained as meaning willingness to
   suffer further. But such an attitude towards an enemy or offender
   would, if not Merely in harmony with the action, but actually the
   motive for it,--imply a lack of love. Could Jesus have been induced to
   take such a view by the imminence of the end of the world, and of
   judgment? Such an expectation might cause Him to overlook anything
   else, but surely not the judgment itself, wherein every one is
   condemned who has not love.

   The most wide-spread and worst mistake in interpreting these words
   consists in taking them all as laws, to be fulfilled in every case.
   That is impossible; for they can in no way be deduced from the mind of
   Jesus as universal expressions of His unchanging will. His own
   demeanour in His intercourse with men shows that it was not His purpose
   to present in Himself such an abnormal type of humanity, nor yet, for
   the sake of heaven, to make of His surroundings a barren wilderness.
   Had He meant these words to be universal rules, He would have been
   worse than the rabbis whose teaching He opposed. Hillel, with his
   scruples about the lawfulness of eating eggs laid on the Sabbath day,
   would, in comparison with Jesus, have been a charitable exponent of the
   law. Such a conception of the words of Jesus is possible only to those
   who wish to explain His words without troubling about Him, since it is
   sharply opposed to the moral consciousness of Jesus which he wished
   that others too should possess.

   Those who, in spite of that, cling to these demands, as to rules of
   universal application, have not yet asked themselves the question, What
   is the way in which the mind of Jesus Himself directs us? They cease
   from really following Jesus, in order that they may obey words whose
   bearing as words of Jesus they have not understood. True following of
   Him is possible only if we become like-minded with Him, and if, having
   this mind in us, and sharing his independence, we aim in our own
   station, at the eternal goal. But if we are willing to obey any words
   we hear, merely because they are traditional words of Jesus, even
   though we do not recognise His mind, that is to say Himself, in
   them--by so doing, we are resisting the person who sought to unite us
   with Himself, and to save us from the darkness of self-deception.

   In this matter it will be hard to give up the long-accustomed habit of
   an insincere obedience; for that requires nothing beyond the reach of
   our purely human powers, and makes it possible for us to be satisfied
   with what we do, and rest upon our labours. On the other hand, the
   independent, originative, self-sacrificing love, that really is
   required of us, transcends the limit of our power. We can understand
   its moral necessity, and therefore we condemn ourselves when we
   perceive that we have it not. Yet we cannot gain it unless those
   conditions within us have been made favourable to its growth; until
   that has happened, the idea of it will suggest that it would rob us of
   all joy and peace. If, then, we still desire to take Christianity
   seriously, our obvious course is to turn aside from that which, in its
   inexorable severity, is morally intelligible to us, and rather try to
   follow that unusual course which Jesus seemingly demands of us in many
   isolated sayings. It is a device that the more readily occurs to one
   because of the secret thought that the stern necessity of things will
   take care that such an attempt does not result in anything more than a
   mere dallying with the absurd.

   But that such feeble trifling has nothing to do with Christianity is
   clear when we recognise that the whole force of Jesus' soul is
   concentrated in a love which is ready for any sacrifice. He who cannot
   summon up the will to be like H i m in this, is none of His. He who
   can, on the other hand, becomes quite indifferent to the claim that he
   should let himself be enslaved by what in some of the words of Jesus
   seems to be incomprehensible. For he knows that, were he to submit to
   such disturbance and confusion within, the effect would be disastrous;
   it would mean separation from Jesus Christ.

   So far, however, are the words themselves from being useless, and much
   less disastrous, that they are a magnificent proof of spiritual freedom
   and power. Let us consider first any passages whereof the key is to be
   found in expectancy of the approaching end of the world. It is such
   words, and the whole attitude of Jesus upon this point, that reveal His
   wondrous energy. Everything dictated by this conviction He carries out
   as a matter of course, and expects His disciples to do the same.
   Friedrich Naumann, in his "Letters on Religion," [5] has shown in an
   excellent way how unreasonable, as compared with this, is the attitude
   of those modern Christians who feel bound to share the eschatological
   standpoint of Jesus, but take good heed not to treat the things of this
   present world with indifference and as though they were not likely to
   continue. With regard to these utterances of Jesus, we confess that we
   cannot possibly comply with them, since we do not share His conception
   of the universe, and so are living in a different world. On the other
   hand, the mind which they reveal should be present also in us; that is,
   the will really to act in accordance with our own convictions.

   Among the other directions of Jesus, those again must he singled out
   which refer directly to the frank and inexhaustible spirit of love,
   which is alone required; or to conduct directly resulting from it, such
   as absolute fidelity to bonds of matrimony, not already dissolved by
   the sin of one of the parties; or, again, to conduct directly
   prohibited by it, as, for example, lustful desire, or thoughts of
   enmity murderous in their intent. In words like these is set before us
   the law that must unconditionally be obeyed, because we perceive it to
   be the expression of moral necessity.

   Our position, however, is different with regard to those other words,
   which require us to renounce possessions and the use of force,
   including law.

   In using such words, Jesus wished in the first place to lead men on to
   a morality that should not be content to stop short at justice. Thus he
   attacks the delusion that it is possible to induce moral conduct in a
   man by a number of regulations curtailing his independence. At the same
   time He reveals the peculiar character of moral conduct; namely, the
   fact that it can be engendered only through the free movement of a
   man's own mind. All sincere action originates in the free will of the
   agent; and such action alone can he understood as fulfilling the law of
   love. In order, like Jesus, to insist upon conduct both loving and
   sincere, it is necessary to combat the indolence that expects to find
   adequate guidance in what others say. To those who, then as now, have
   been led by moral insincerity and slackness to look for such
   regulations, or to imagine they already possessed them, Jesus addresses
   the words "But I say unto you." He cannot possibly mean that His aim is
   to set before them for the first time right statutes of the same kind.
   On the contrary, because Jesus wishes to open the way for a right
   disposition within, He is intent upon destroying the preconceived idea
   that such regulations could even exist, as would be able, regarded as
   an external authority, to cover all and sundry occasions of moral
   conduct. Therefore He demands that, instead of acting on the obvious
   legal principle of retaliation, encroachments upon property protected
   by law should not be resisted, but met by voluntary surrender.

   Taken as a pattern for exact imitation, is that particularly hard to
   follow, or not rather very much easier than the serious duties of love?
   An indolent man could desire no better way of making his morality easy
   than by regular obedience to such a command. It is true lie would not
   thereby attain to the superhuman; he would sink to the lowest depths.
   On the other hand, such a demand, if understood as a general rule, is
   not only extremely difficult, but absolutely impossible for any morally
   earnest man to fulfil. Therefore, the very men whom Jesus aimed at
   helping would be obliged to reject this saying, if presented to them as
   a general rule. Consequently, Jesus cannot possibly have intended it in
   that sense. To do so, would have been to act in opposition o His own
   mind. The fact that Christians have so long overlooked this, and still
   occasionally seem to forget it, may no doubt largely be due to that
   pious attitude which was thought to be necessary towards the words of
   Jesus,-- a piety that expressly abandons any attempt to be morally
   earnest and sincere. When He who emancipates the conscience speaks,
   people think it unnecessary to inquire how His words can be understood
   as the expression of strict sincerity and earnest love; and thus Jesus,
   who was so full of sincerity and love, is made responsible when people
   seize upon His words, without any question as to sincerity and love,
   and suppose that by time-serving they can draw nigh to Him.

   By such words as these, Jesus aimed at explaining, to all who have ears
   to hear, that demands may be made upon them so inexorable as to
   preclude any otherwise justifiable recourse to law. They arise out of
   particular circumstances wherein the disciple of Jesus has his Master
   with him, and the power of the mind of Jesus is suggested by the way in
   which He breaks down every barrier. We hold fast therefore to these
   demands, as capable at any moment of becoming practical for us. But as
   rules of universal application we cannot accept them. If we tried to
   obey them as general rules, we should in so doing cease to follow our
   Guide; for we could not find in them the Jesus whom we know. His power
   and His greatness shine forth, on the other hand, in the thought that
   none can be protected by his legal rights against the claims of moral
   necessity.

   If then the words of Jesus be understood as due to His mental outlook,
   - they will not obscure the fact that the pursuit of power and
   possessions, as protected by law, is a moral obligation. Unless, in
   particular circumstances, love requires us to sacrifice these things,
   it is our moral duty to do battle for the conditions under which we
   exist on earth. Those who feel that. Jesus not merely summons them to
   earnest self-examination, but also hinders them in the fulfilment of
   this duty, surely make Him a kind of Jewish rabbi, who would keep us in
   the leading-strings of ordinances, and sustain us with something
   incomprehensible. Friedrich Naumann truly says: "He who considers that
   conduct alone to be Christian for which he can quote direct words of
   Jesus, must no longer be in favour of maintaining the State by a system
   of armed force" (op. cit. p. 48). Certainly any one who thinks of Jesus
   as a Jewish law-giver will be able to find a "complete Christianity
   only in monasticism, or in Tolstoi's paths of anarchy. If he cannot
   decide in favour of these, he must, like the Catholic laity, be content
   with a semi-Christianity. In some of his statements Naumann himself
   seems to reach this result. When, for example, he says, "Not all
   fulfilment of duty is Christian" (op. cit. p. 42), he seems to mean
   that our moral consciousness may lead us beyond the limits of
   Christianity. In my address at Darmstadt I understood him in that
   sense; and many will still take him to mean that Christianity is far
   too kindly and gentle a force to co-operate in the human struggle for
   existence; that the character of Jesus is made up of compassion and
   modesty, love and asceticism; and that consequently lie is no leader
   for men who with the means given them in this world wish to attain some
   definite object. Perhaps it is a good thing that Naumann, with his
   incomparable gift of discovering the secret thoughts of the soul and
   speaking to the hearts of men of the present day, does give the general
   impression that in his own case an exceedingly rich and spiritual
   Christianity and resolute pursuance of secular work are clearly
   distinguished. For in this way he helps to pay off an old debt,
   incurred, not indeed by Luther, but by Lutheranism.

   We must not overlook the judgment implied in the hard sayings wherein
   Jesus tells His disciples that it is necessary to renounce power and
   possessions. Unless we are ready to sacrifice that which is safeguarded
   by the law, we are false to our own manhood. To earn and enjoy all the
   gifts of civilisation is not the life appointed for man, the life that
   Jesus lived, and wished to reveal to His followers. The really free and
   fruitful life of the spirit prevails, not in all those forms of
   civilisation whereby we seek to enchain and dominate nature, but in a
   self-sacrificing love, produced in us after we ourselves have
   experienced an inexhaustible Love or become conscious of God. To man,
   called to be free, all those other good things are as much a menace as
   a help.

   They are a means to life; but those who are troubled and anxious about
   them are in constant danger of forgetting life itself, in their pursuit
   of these means. The extent of the risk is proved by the fact that it is
   generally in the State, especially in foreign policy, that the dangers
   of power first appear, while those of possession become noticeable in
   the higher grades of finance. The noble folly of the cry "Disarm!"
   would be just as much in place in the field of competition as in that
   of real warfare. It is hard to say on which arena the violence is more
   terrible, the suffering worse. The Christian must never forget that the
   results of his labour--industrial, scientific, artistic,
   political--open up an abyss that threatens to engulf his future. The
   only salvation for his personal life lies in the power of his moral
   consciousness to impel him to something higher than all this pomp.
   Where this strong attraction to the other world is missing,
   Christianity is at an end. By it the difference between the
   Christianity possible to-day and that of primitive times is lessened,
   for in this respect both must needs be alike.

   At the same time, let us thank God that such distinction is not wholly
   swept away. Through its existence we are detached from that which was
   transient in Jesus, to be the more closely united with Him who abides
   for ever and ever. When we perceive that the world in which we are
   placed is different from that of Jesus, we are prevented from allowing
   the dead circumstances of His life on earth to hide from us Him, the
   living mind, that overcame His world, as we must overcome ours.

   In early Christianity there are two points or equal importance to
   us,--the typical extreme of energy with which men sought another world;
   and an aversion to the tasks of civilisation, such as we cannot
   seriously, and therefore should not, desire. The first of these is a
   powerful reminder to us, but so too is the second, and the second is
   far more apt than the first to be disregarded by us. At the present
   time there can be few Christians who would not readily echo the
   following words of Friedrich Paulsen: "Even for us who are
   representatives of a modern civilisation, there would be something
   lacking if primitive Christianity, with its supramundane and unsecular
   ideas, were to die out altogether. Christianity mingles with the
   civilised life of modern nations something quite different that keeps
   it within the bounds of healthy moderation; like salt it preserves it
   from corruption. Since Jesus appeared on earth, a change has taken
   place: men can no longer be engrossed entirely in this world. Just as
   for us it is possible no longer to worship power, and deify the State
   or the representative of political authority, so we have ceased to
   devote ourselves entirely to power and possessions, to pleasure and to
   culture; in other words, we are no longer entirely satisfied by the
   benefits of civilisation. With Christianity there has been implanted in
   the soul of the Western races of humanity a new feeling, the feeling
   for another world, a world different from all that here gladdens and
   saddens the hearts of men." [6] Would that among the men of modern
   civilisation many really felt this working of Jesus in themselves, and
   had sufficient conscientiousness to give Him His due! At any rate, we
   are grateful to Paulsen for his excellent statement of the case. [7]

   It is, however, even more important to ponder the meaning of the fact
   presented in the distinction here drawn, and actually made in history,
   between Jesus and His mode of life. Ourattitude towards the world
   cannot be that of Jesus; even the purpose to will that it should be so
   is stifled in the air that we breathe to-day. The state of affairs is
   very clearly described by Naumann, who says with truth: "Therefore we
   do not seek Jesus' advice on points connected with the management of
   the State and political economy." (Op. cit. p. 49.) But when he goes on
   to say: "I give my vote and I canvass for the German fleet, not because
   I am a Christian, but because I am a citizen, and because I have
   learned to renounce all hope of finding fundamental questions of State
   determined in the Sermon on the Mount," we can detect a fallacy. He
   regards as painful renunciation what ought, on the part of the
   Christian, to be free decision and a voluntary act. If we have once
   understood the mind that Jesus wishes to produce in us, we cannot fail
   to see that we must become as free and independent as He.

   As a result of that frame of mind whereby We are united with Him, we
   desire the existence of a national State, with a character and with
   duties with which Jesus was not yet acquainted; we will not let
   ourselves be led astray, even if in this form of human nature various
   features are as sharply opposed to the mode of life and standpoint of
   Jesus as is the dauntless use of arms. We cannot say, then, with
   Naumann, that, under pressure of troubles from which no living religion
   is free, we renounce a "complete Christianity." For, after all,
   complete Christianity is the personal life of discipline and freedom
   revealed to man in Jesus. Anything in Jesus that we cannot understand
   as triumphant personal life is not for us part of a complete
   Christianity, but at the very most of a bygone Christianity. The inward
   independence that we gain when the good begins to work within us, is
   protected when we recognise the extent to which, in many points, Jesus'
   conception of the world has, by the guidance of God, become remote from
   ours. This result of science and historical research we will not
   deplore, for it is God's gift to us, and if resolutely turned to
   account, must put an end to much in Christianity that at present is of
   a sluggish and timid character. To remove this, we must further free
   ourselves entirely from the sentimental desire to adopt in our own
   lives even elements in Jesus which we cannot decide to be eternal. That
   is a kind of relic-worship that seems to be widely popular in the
   Evangelical Church, but is assuredly not in accordance with the mind of
   Jesus, [8] though He would regard it in a kindly way, as betokening
   adherence to Him, if as yet of a hazy kind.

   Naumann's full discussion of the question also suggests something else
   that is necessary if we are to place in their true setting the moral
   directions of Jesus,--a setting it is essential to understand if we are
   to make right use of them.

   Naumann says our life can never be a life wholly determined by
   Christianity. It would be more correct to say that it cannot be
   complete as a whole, because it can never be a life completely
   determined by morality. We are always in a state of transition from the
   constraint of a natural existence to the freedom of a personal life.
   Naumann, in his own way, describes the position admirably (op. cit. p.
   40): "Go to the Pope, to the chief Court chaplain, the monk, the
   professor, the pious lady, the pious man of business, the pious
   peasant, the pious beggar, the pious grey-headed wife; everywhere you
   will find, bound up with the spirit of surrender and brotherly love, a
   natural basis of common sense, intent on the struggle for
   self-preservation." "And now what shall we say? Shall we continually
   deplore this state of affairs, or simply acknowledge that it exists? Of
   the two courses, the latter appears to me the more straightforward and
   sincere. Whatever cannot be altered, must be clearly understood in its
   full bluntness, before one can be thoroughly reconciled to it. To put
   it briefly, I know that, in order to live, we must all recognise as the
   principle of our being, the natural conditions of the struggle for
   existence; and also that it is only upon this basis that we are free to
   realise the higher morality of the Gospel, as far as it is possible to
   do so upon such a foundation" (op. cit. p. 46). "The actual
   circumstances of life are given quantities, and there is but small
   scope to shape them freely. But it is just within this free space that
   our personal ego has power to work" (op. cit. p. 50). Here is a clear
   statement of a very important fact, which, to the great loss of
   Evangelical Christianity in Germany, Schleiermacher failed sufficiently
   to appreciate. [9]

   Naumann, however, mistakes the nature of this fact. He thinks that in
   so far as we are subject to such necessity, our union with Jesus
   suffers; in reality we have to admit that what takes place is quite
   different. In what we do under this stress of compulsion, as creatures
   of circumstance or children of nature, we do not realise the good; we
   are not morally active. Yet as Christians we are not thereby separated
   from Jesus and His God. On the contrary, we serve Him aright if at the
   same time we live in the belief that by the Father of Spirits all
   things are created. Thus we believe that, in the stern pressure of
   circumstances, we experience fatherly care, which requires us to enter
   into competition with others, as a condition of real and effective
   life. This belief can have no place in us if we do not train the will
   to do ultimately everything in our power for the service of love, and
   so raise men higher and bind them to us in genuine fellowship. Now this
   faith in the power of the good element in real facts is supported and
   strengthened more by the fact of the Person of Jesus in this world than
   by anything else. Jesus is therein our Redeemer. For it is a case of
   redemption, when a man engaged in moral conflict is able with a good
   conscience to take his part in the life of nature that he must share if
   he is to exist at all and to any purpose. In the Words of Jesus the
   conception of morality, as independent and productive love, is clearly
   developed; and when the goal of morality was thus disclosed to mankind,
   a fact was at the same time supplied that brings within the reach of
   Christians a moral existence upon earth, by leading us to faith in the
   power of this love, or becoming to us a revelation of God.

   To live for others of our own free will is possible only at those
   moments when we can feel that the eternal revelation of God, the
   victorious power of love, gives us a joy which time cannot impair, nor
   eternity exhaust. We believe that when men are hampered by a feeling of
   guilt, and uncertainty as to their fate, God has many ways of setting
   them free to live for others. Yet the means are ultimately always the
   same that God uses: the power of personal goodness, which in its
   self-sacrifice humbles and raises a man at the same time. This
   memorable experience of moral contact may open our eyes to the
   redeeming power of Jesus. For we know no personal goodness expressing
   in such spotless purity the will to sacrifice itself for us, as that of
   Jesus in His Death. If we are sufficiently in earnest not to let this
   fact escape us, an experience will one day be granted us which, for the
   individual as for the human race, is the beginning of a new life. The
   sense of being forsaken during an endless night, oppressed by utter
   loneliness, will cease when the wonderful figure of Jesus compels us to
   open our hearts. In Him alone in all this world is given to us that
   pure manifestation of a power to which we gladly unfold ourselves and
   unreservedly yield. This joyful trust in the mysterious greatness of
   Jesus is our redemption from moral helplessness. We must indeed ever
   rouse ourselves afresh, and strive to attain the peace of mind in which
   this happiness may grow; and, if we do, our joy in the gift of God in
   Jesus Christ will continually gain strength, and become in us a power
   to deal honestly with his Words and conform to the knowledge of
   righteousness to which we are led by them. Then, as the redeemed of
   Jesus, we shall be united with Him, and really obey His directions.
   That is a simple account of the substance of the Gospel; any one may
   understand it who does not shrink from the plain truth of moral facts,
   and has no desire to ignore the realities around him. But we all need
   the Gospel; for we all wander in darkness, isolated in our inmost
   being, till this light shines in our hearts.

   We must accept the directions of Jesus, neither as enforced and
   arbitrary laws, nor yet as mere outbursts of emotion, but as the
   effulgence of His mind. They are not cords He has wound about us, but
   clues to direct us to freedom. Tf in that sense we apprehend them, we
   shall further perceive that the spirit that moves within them is also
   that which is truly active in the life of the present time. For the
   power to assert itself, that is characteristic of life, belongs
   particularly to this spirit, which is bent only on serving; and the
   ease with which a living force adapts itself to circumstances is found
   nowhere so much as in this will to love, invariably intent upon an
   eternal goal. There can be no doubt as to whether the directions of
   Jesus can be harmonised with the claims of social morality to-day; but
   it is questionable whether many as yet are able to understand them. To
   do so must be difficult for men by whom Nietzsche is "falsely esteemed
   a philosopher"; and by whom, in their passing moods of disgust with
   civilisation, Tolstoi is honoured as the prophet of a new era of moral
   perception. Still harder is it for those who, possessing the Christian
   tradition, nevertheless are so uncertain and confused that they seek
   for new revelations in Buddhism, or even in occultism. Least able,
   however, to understand the true force of the moral ideas of Jesus,--the
   unity of His mind,--are the numbers of religious people who are
   practically tied to the principle of pharisaic morality, according to
   which certain rules may teach us the nature of the good, and a will
   that is ready to be hound by them may be accounted good. Yet even among
   all these, every one will at length understand His thoughts, who draws
   so near to the person of Jesus that he is conscious of His power to
   deliver, and becomes free for service as He was. May we Christians,
   perceiving how little the moral clearness of Jesus has up till now been
   allowed to operate among us, have our consciences stirred to
   discontent, and our hearts filled with zeal!

   [7] My thanks are due also to several who took part in the discussion
   at Darmstadt, such as Pastor Christlieb and Licentiate Weinel, as well
   as to Dr. Rade for his article in the Christian World, for the way in
   which they insisted on renouncement of the world as a vital cord of
   Christianity, and endeavoured to supply what, in my address, they
   evidently felt to be lacking. They may rest assured that I would
   willingly have dwelt upon the subject with as much stress as they, but,
   in an address already too long, I was not able to treat of every
   important matter with equal emphasis. At the same time, the point on
   which they lay stress was not omitted entirely.

   [8] Baumgarten, in the Monatschrift für die kirchliche Praxis (Monthly
   Journal of Church Practice), 1903, p. 417, shows clearly that we lose
   nothing by deciding to hold fast to that Jesus alone of Whom we can
   honestly say, "The same for evermore." I must protest against just one
   phrase he uses concerning the "average man, who stands in need of a
   certain literal legalism." That we all require.
